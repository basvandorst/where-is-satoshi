Do some more reading to actually learn about it
@_date: 2015-06-05 18:01:04
@_date: 2015-12-11 14:25:37
I thought this had already been well-documented. Bitcoin has built-in turing completeness, it's just not utilised.
@_date: 2015-12-13 00:52:13
Just torrent it and then add the file to your Qt directory

@_date: 2014-06-05 22:12:11
@_date: 2014-04-27 13:01:43
So it's basically the same as BitWasp but decentralised?
@_date: 2014-11-12 21:40:49
@_date: 2014-02-24 22:05:24
Just be chill. Try not to go full on with the detailed part of how Bitcoin works (the part people generally associate with nerds).  
Just try make it sound simple and straightforward.
@_date: 2014-02-25 22:07:10
Pretty sure 7% of the total USD is a lot more than $400mn
@_date: 2014-08-27 21:48:01
I actually like the idea of this, however I'm not too sure it's plausible to expect all Bitcoin wallet's to integrate (and continuously update) the database of usernames.
@_date: 2014-06-05 22:24:40
On their site they say "Auto-convert or forward funds to any third party." So I'm assuming you can convert to USD

Buy $150,000 worth of Bitcoin (from Coinbase, Localbitcoin, Bitstamp etc.) Although you might have to buy a little from each if they have buying limits.  
Then send them to a Bitcoin wallet overseas...
@_date: 2014-01-26 19:04:24
Try adding a TLDR or at least breaking your text up into paragraphs. A large chunk like that makes it very unappealing to read.
@_date: 2014-02-24 20:33:11
BitWasp ( is launching soon and it looks very promising seeing as it's open source and they've been working on it for a while!
@_date: 2014-05-04 22:06:28
Does microbits work for tipping?
@_date: 2014-08-25 22:40:59
They are still in the private, invite-only stage at the moment,
@_date: 2014-01-26 14:54:26
I just have a computer wallet and only use it for online transactions at the moment. But I'm aware Coinkite have a Bitcoin card that stores your coins and can be used on one of their POS'.
@_date: 2014-07-31 17:27:26
Also Circle should be going public soon, you can buy with card there.

swap you're dogecoin for bitcoin on cryptsy

Yes, most likely, if the wallet wasn't password protected.

Thanks for link but unfortunately I'm on mobile and cannot view external links. Would you mind summing it up for me?
@_date: 2014-07-19 19:07:13
How come they pay the mining fees?

That's cool of them :p I'll see if I can sign up even though I'm not from AUS
@_date: 2014-05-28 20:39:59
Ok thanks!  
100 bits @_date: 2014-02-28 06:32:32
No because it's up to the Bitcoin users wherher they download it or not. If they don't download the new Qt then it will not be implemented for them. Simple as that.
@_date: 2014-06-04 10:36:52
They refer to "Tor and other proxies" in the OP, say that they can be bypassed

@_date: 2014-05-30 23:13:01
If you can't get one why not offer to sell customers Bitcoin for cash (+ a very small markup)?  
Since it's a computer shop, you're customers are ones who would most likely be interested in BTC.

If block size is increased and Bitcoin continues to grow, I think yes, miners will be able to make a profit.
@_date: 2014-09-12 21:13:47
This looks awesome, definitely got potential!

Do you know if there are any decent androids around the £15-£30 range?  
I want to buy a phone primarily for a bitcoin wallet and as you'd probably guess, I don't want to spend a lot
@_date: 2014-05-23 20:55:39
I agree they are necessary at the moment but I still try to avoid them as much as possible. I usually use LocalBitcoins to facilitate my Bitcoin purchases.
@_date: 2014-06-22 21:57:29
Saying no gold is lost and can be found is like saying no Bitcoins are lost all can be gained.  
  
If a piece of gold is at the bottom of the ocean, you have about as much chance of getting it as you do bruteforcing the private keys of an account with lost BTC.
@_date: 2014-02-28 06:30:00
It basically means a physical store as opposed to an online store.
@_date: 2014-05-04 22:25:58

I always use that site for my betting shit, they've been legit so far so I can't fault em.
@_date: 2014-01-26 20:35:30
Try  and you'll be able to sell on there. Either for online transfers or for cash in hand.
@_date: 2014-05-04 22:04:35
Yeah, I actually prefer microbits. It's a little less general
@_date: 2014-01-24 23:03:47
nope, I'm pretty sure it's my lamborghini?
@_date: 2014-01-24 23:57:42
It's also extremely difficult for me to sell bitcoins (not in US).
@_date: 2014-02-11 06:58:42
I thought this, too. Would definitely be useful if something similar could happen and would make it a lot more convenient to send payments.
@_date: 2014-08-15 23:15:25
@_date: 2014-07-06 14:25:35
That'd be like having the dollar sign on a team's top. I think more appropriate is if individual companies (like coinbase, bitpay etc) pay to sponsor teams. That way, it's gained publicity for them and equally for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-08-05 14:38:08
I don't think it's him, I think other guy was on about Ionly Hodl
@_date: 2014-05-28 22:11:17
Is the password set by the wallet required to view the seed? Cause if (worst case) I was ratted, they'd have access to my wallet but I'm wondering if they'd also have access to my seed, even if they don't have the wallet password?
@_date: 2014-06-05 22:11:44
Coinkite have a POS that does exactly this. Displays QR codes on the payment system and on receipts and stuff. It's quite expensive but not too bad:

Why not put it up on a Bitcoin-supported crowdfunding site?
@_date: 2014-08-01 17:16:12
According to this:   
$2.1mn, but the article seems a bit bullish to me
@_date: 2014-02-28 06:48:50
It's still up to the sender how much tx fee they wish to add, they can still add the previous minimum (will be $0.05). Chances are, in fact, this tx will be confirmed faster because it should have a larger fee than most txs.
@_date: 2014-06-22 09:59:53
They claim by September
@_date: 2014-06-05 22:14:23
Then we'd be using a different name for smaller fractions of bitcoins. So that 0.0377 could be like 37,700 Microbits (or whatever name is about)
@_date: 2014-01-27 16:04:02
It would definitely be a boom in price. As for spending the Bitcoins, I can't speak for everybody but I'd certainly spend mine whenever buying a product from Amazon/eBay. Also, yes, it's unlikely they'll keep the money in BTC, they'll most likely convert to USD right before.  
I don't think we'll see Bitcoin purchases (and the money staying as BTC) until people and suppliers are being paid in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-23 11:45:57
But to compensate for the lower price per BTC, the buyer would have paid more bitcoin equalling the total USD. At the end of it, Overstock are getting their product's worth in USD.
@_date: 2014-07-19 17:18:21
I definitely agree, I was just trying to highlight how pointless these regulations are
@_date: 2014-01-26 20:36:08
LocalBitcoins will let you buy with a debit card with online banking, you can also try VirWox (can buy with PayPal) but beware, the Virwox fees are high!

They charged for advertising, so far I can't see any adverts on Circle's website so they must be getting revenue from elsewhere.

Cryptsy is okay, I guess
@_date: 2014-01-24 23:34:08
he said in his post that he had tried localbitcoins but people were charging like $200-$300 more, did you not read it? aha  
  
But OP, I think localbitcoin is your best option here, unless you can find somebody you know/trust who's willing to sell them to you for market price.

StartJOIN (started by Max Keiser) allows BTC crowdfunding. (

He may be a bit loopy but you can't knock him off straight away when his previous statement turned out to be true...
@_date: 2014-02-24 22:06:48
I was actually considering getting one, only £5. It's just a shame they're only suitable for stores with the Coinkite POS (and I don't know of any).
@_date: 2014-01-27 15:44:00
I agree with the jump thing. Bitcoin implementation on Amazon or eBay would mean you could buy almost anything with Bitcoin and would mean a hell of a lot in terms of general adoption.
@_date: 2014-05-28 21:11:50
So I can just download Electrum, transfer my BTC and then just remember/write down the 12 words? And if I do that I will be able to access the wallet from any computer in the world as long as it has electrum? No copy/backup of the wallet is required?  
  
100 bits @_date: 2014-02-23 22:11:55
I totally agree. No need for a head foundation.

@_date: 2014-11-08 13:27:35
yeah I prefer uBit more than just bits because at least the u before resembles the mu which is micro. But I wasn't aware that Bitcoin Qt already gave that option, that's pretty nice.  
Just need Electrum and Multibit (and others?) to hop on it now.  
  
@_date: 2014-07-09 05:43:15
No it won't. That requires around 500mb ram which isn't possible on a cheap USB
@_date: 2014-06-05 19:12:31
Thanks! It looks awesome
@_date: 2014-05-29 15:03:59
Yeah, I agree. For outside of reddit microbits seems a lot more appropriate.
@_date: 2014-07-09 19:21:47
Why is Bitcoin generally considered better then ripple? Is it all to do with the centralized and pre-mine thing?
@_date: 2014-01-27 17:11:55
Not sure whether to take that as something promising or just another generic reply.  
Didn't somebody say on the other day that Ikea were going to be accepting BTC?

Wow, all parts of your name are all extremely similar :p
@_date: 2014-06-01 21:48:42
Maybe you could do US based bidding but payment in BTC, at least until volatility decreases?
@_date: 2014-06-01 19:02:07
no, once you've locked it it's confirmed

I would totally buy this if I could. Don't really care about having the latest, most expensive phone but the fact that my current blackberry has no Bitcoin wallet app (and even if it did, it'd be too laggy to run it) really annoys me.
@_date: 2014-07-08 15:13:56
Yeah I know they're different, I was just asking why you prefer ancap over the other. Ancap seems like it'd fail instantly imo
@_date: 2014-07-06 20:32:46
ubits and satoshis (for x10-6 and x10-9 respectively) not sure which. But either way, definitely not bits

Why an ancap opposed to ancom?
@_date: 2014-10-24 15:45:51
I'd recommend against it, it really blows
@_date: 2014-01-24 23:19:50
Yeah, and the way to increase use of bitcoin (to possibly compete with banks) is to increase adoption. So try and inform as many businesses as you can about adopting Bitcoin (preferably companies who offer a product/service not already offered for bitcoin)
@_date: 2014-02-14 09:42:10
Based on that image I'd say still in early adopters phase. Won't progress until we start to see companies accepting BTC and leaving them in BTC (not instantly converting to USD).
@_date: 2014-03-27 21:23:08
You bought 1g of gold? Must've been tiny
@_date: 2014-07-19 17:00:40
It's bullshit. If it comes into play, it won't affect us. We can just end up sending from address to address without any company facilitating the transaction (like coinbase, bitpay etc). They can't stop a decentralized transaction.

Mining will never end as long as transactions are happening. Once all coins have been minted, the incentive for miners is the transaction fee.

Yeah this will be the best! Super entertaining for those watching and also will make a good news story
@_date: 2014-01-24 22:42:21
Do it man! It's definitely needed for the pot industry. As for legal issues, if you used a service like Coinbase/Bitpay then you'd have all dollars anyway so you'd just go about as normal...

First time I've heard of this group, thanks for sharing!
@_date: 2014-05-23 20:53:23
The general population (or at least those who use Bitcoin) will not feel comfortable using a marketplace with black market goods on. I think for something to truly take off it has to be user-friendly, not something that could potentially scare people off.

I dunno man, Pied Piper's compression algorithm looked pretty impressive with its Weissman score.  
I'm sure it could do this

This is good news, especially for all you 'Preme kids out there
@_date: 2014-07-31 20:37:37
If they want to keep their BTC (instead of instantly converting to dollars) then they could easily pay their employees with them instead of going to the effort of cashing out.
@_date: 2014-02-23 11:20:12
They convert to USD as soon as payment goes through so they count the value at time of tx, not based on the current price of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-01-24 23:25:37
lol, t-shirt looks cool as fuck man
@_date: 2014-01-26 19:13:28
Yeah that's what I did, used my phone and zoomed out until only the QR was on screen and lined up. Maybe I never left it long enough, my QRs are usually recognised in a few secs and I only gave this one around 10 secs until I concluded it didn't detect it.
@_date: 2014-02-17 15:31:06
I'd say no to this. I've been getting minute payments/dust transactions to my wallet in the last week and it's annoying as fuck for me.  
  
This definitely isn't the way to go.
@_date: 2014-08-10 19:55:41
I'm not sure why but when I send some BTC via coinbase (to an offsite address - on chain), if it's more than around 1000 bits then I don't get charged a tx fee and it also gets confirmed fast.
@_date: 2014-10-10 21:46:02
Oh so pretty
@_date: 2014-07-05 07:18:34
@_date: 2014-02-24 21:58:09
Great! Also very good how they can operate like vending machines meaning that anybody can walk up to it, pay money and receive bitcoins. None of that proving your identity shit.
@_date: 2014-01-26 17:23:47
I'm not 100% as I don't really use it as such, although I do have an account for which I do not pay for. I understand they do offer paid (premium) services but I'm not sure what they offer as opposed to the free accounts.
@_date: 2014-09-02 23:31:58
Thank you!
@_date: 2014-06-01 23:14:32
Same, made the switch a few days ago.  
That's the great thing about BTC, you don't have one thing forced upon you.  
  
If you don't like the ideas of sending a small amount each tx then change wallet, it's simple! Nobody is forcing you to use multibit.
@_date: 2014-05-28 20:02:48
With Electrum, what is to stop me guessing 12 random words and accessing somebody else's wallet?
@_date: 2014-02-23 21:38:17
Exactly. The whole point of decentralized is that nobody is in charge. Sure, the bitcoin foundation - or anybody else for that matter - can release new features but it also requires everybody else to agree with it for it to work.  
@_date: 2014-07-20 16:35:12
lol this'll get removed
@_date: 2014-05-04 21:56:15
Yeah it's uBTC. I, personally, prefer 'Microbits' to just bits as I think many will find it confusing but oh well.

In UK we call it factorial
@_date: 2014-02-21 19:27:18
For this to happen, it would have to be a centralized service offered which kind of goes against Bitcoin. On top of this, it'd require the people, who use the card, to trust the owner of the service with their money, which as we've seen from recent events (gox) won't happen.

Can I ask how you're doing this?  
I understand multi-sig to an extent, so let's say I want to start a league with 10 players and use a 5 of 10 address, then what happens if you lose contact with the people or if they refuse to sign? Then the bitcoins are stuck, no?  
Also, what is stopping you making like a 4 of 10 address and then you holding 4 of the keys and signing the tx when you've got enough people to send BTC.  
  
Not being snarky, I'm genuinely curious how it works :p

Dude, cold storage is only really suitable if you're looking to store for a decent amount of time. I'd say a software wallet (where you hold the private keys) is more than enough for most bitcoin users. Something like electrum or multibit is good.
@_date: 2014-06-01 18:44:23
I've had market price a few times on localbitcoin, only other option I can think of is buy something like OKPay or Ukash with cash and then fund an online exchange with that.

Ok yeah, my bad. But I think perhaps time and value should be considered factors? I just don't think recommended cold storage to a new user (someone who might not fully understand BTC) is such a good idea.

Yeah these are good but I also think a PP is needed which instantly converts Litecoin to Fiat. With a new crypto (even Bitcoin) people would prefer to have the security of instantly having fiat rather than potentially losing money due to the volatility of a crypto.  
These PPs are definitely worth going for if you don't mind converting yourself but if not then we'll have to wait until coinbase, bitpay or something similar pops up.

Some of the people spread it for the money. Hoping the price of Bitcoin rises, leaving them with more money because their Bitcoins are worth more. On the other hand, there are people (like me) who support and spread the word of BTC to try and support the free market and reduce the amount of control and domination fiat currencies like the US Dollar (a centralised curreny which is constantly being manipulated to increase the profit and power of those "higher up") have over the people of a country.

I don't think it should work like that, one whole sector uses one and a whole other sector uses another. I think they should rather work together.  
For example, a large transaction (house, car, bills etc.) should be paid with Bitcoin and smaller, everyday transactions (fuel, video games, food) should be paid with Litecoin. With Bitcoins, you'd have to wait around 10 minutes for a single confirmation (this'd probably make it awkward buying something small or paying for a meal) whereas Litecoin's transactions are usually confirmed in around 2 minutes.

@_date: 2013-10-30 17:45:34
Litecoin has often been compared previously to the silver of Bitcoin's gold. Meaning they are both useful but in their own ways.  
For example, Bitcoin seems the more appropriate choice for large, online transactions whereas I believe Litecoin would be the more appropriate choice for a F2F or smaller online transaction due to the shorter confirmation times. With Bitcoins, you may have to wait around 10 minutes for a single confirmation (this could probably get awkward in a store) whereas Litecoin's transactions are usually confirmed in around 2 minutes.  
It is possible for two crypto-currencies to co-exist and compliment each other rather than compete with each other.
