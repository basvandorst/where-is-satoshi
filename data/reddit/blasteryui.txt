Thanks for the downvote. I never said the address recieved the Bitcoin in 5 minutes. I said I paid for it and sent it. The address recieved it in maybe 15-20 minutes or so.

From vault to wallet, 3 days and now from wallet to address, ,3 days.

I just tried shakepay, tried newton as somebody suggested, haven't tried coinberry yet. Shakepay seems to have my heart, genius idea of doing an e-transfer to yourself. I sent cash to myself, bought bitcoin, then sent the bitcoin to an address, all within 5 minutes.. now just waiting for my address to receive the bitcoin, if all goes well, thank you shakepay!

No even sending money from the wallet to the address takes 3 days. I used shakepay as somebody suggested on here. Bought Bitcoin and sent it to an address within 5 minutes.

Ok I'm not going to argue. I sent coins from my wallet NOT my vault, to an address. It still says it's being delayed.

I'm fine with that but I imagine the fee is cheaper for a service where they send it to an address of your choosing directly.. instead of going to a wallet and then sending to another address. I use to use quickbt but my interac doesn't work with it anymore.

Hey guys another question.. so I'm using coinbase.. now I'm verified.. but it says I have to wait a full week before the coins are deposited..? Sure the rates are lower.. but for me thats not worth it.. way to long. Is Quadrica instant? Now I gotta wait longer to verify with another site :/

le sigh guess I'll have to wait before I can fund me wallet! Thanks for the links though, the rates are lower then QuickBT you were saying right?

Thanks for all the suggestions guys, you've been very helpful.

Checking them out now.. it appears coinbase needs a couple days for it to work since it sends deposits to your account for verifying.. reminds me of Paypal. Does Quad have the same requirements?

I figured out how to do instant transfer.. however its not compatible with VISA-DEBIT apparently.. Anybody know of sites that will work? My card is a debit card.. but its called "Visa Debit".

I appreciate all of your suggestions however they all require a waiting period to verify my account.. None of these from what I can see will actually let have instant bitcoin for today. Quickbt for example doesn't require any verification just a phone number and a BC address. Unfortunately they only use interac no visa debit, or regular visa.
