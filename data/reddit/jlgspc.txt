Make sure you have the Coinbase withdrawal limit you need

There are a few different ways to go about buying that many for the smallest amount of hassle with the least amount of red tape. I’ll send you some info

The best way to learn about something is to have a stake in it! Dip your feet in now and see if it's for you.

He should speak with an advisor or read up on how much of his current lifestyle he can maintain with his current level of retirement savings and investments. He should take into account inflation and taxes etc etc. only then should he buy Bitcoin. 
I've seen too many of the older generation who have not planned properly for the future and are living on monthly social security checks. Bitcoin could go to the moon but it's still a nascent technology and as much as things could go right, they can also go very wrong.
If you're younger like I am I can tolerate a lot more risk than someone almost at retirement age and my portfolio reflects that with my crypto holdings.

If you need fiat safe and liquid then you could do this. The banks won't give you over ~1ish percent though

If you have iOS I'd like to recommend breadwallet. Very simple and I still use it now as a beginner. (3 months in). Any more than $1000 I throw into a hardware wallet. I use a ledger Nano S. just make sure to back up your seeds offline and never share them with people you wouldn't trust with your money!

The ledger Nano S uses google chrome apps. Once you get it all set up you hook it up to your computer and start the Bitcoin app after downloading it from the official link on the website. While connected you can see a tab to receive bitcoins. Copy and Paste this link into the send bitcoins page of your exchange.
MAKE SURE THE ADDRESS YOU PASTED IS THE EXACT ADDRESS ON YOUR LEDGER APP. There have been some reports of some viruses that lie dormant waiting for your computers clipboard to copy a bitcoin address then replaces it with a similar address once pasted. Manually verifying is the only way to make sure you are sending it to the correct address
I personally use Coinbase as it is one of the few exchanges available in my state

Purchase 2 or 4 Bitcoin hardware wallets. Buy Bitcoin through an exchange or local bitcoins. Make sure you set up and write down the seeds when setting up the hardware wallets. Do not type them onto your phone or computer.
Put 50/50 of the funds into two of the hardware wallets and purchase a fireproof safe as a minimum to hold the seeds to the hardware wallets. If the hardware wallets are lost you can have immediate access to the funds by restoring your remaining two hardware wallets through the seeds you have locked up. Preferably you can keep the seeds off-site in a locked container somewhere. Some people use cryptosteel for extra security

Coinbase upped my limit after I uploaded identifying documents and linked my bank account. I did have about a Bitcoins worth of transactions at the lower limit before they increased it so that may have factored in.

Coinbase alerts have been pretty good to me.

Make sure you save your seed somewhere no one else can find it, preferably in a safe. If anyone finds it and there’s a very good chance they’ll figure out what it’s for and you’ll put your coins at risk

From my understanding, ISPs can inhibit access to content or charge more for delivering certain content. With the majority of internet being provided by only a few ISPs I wouldn’t put it past them to raise prices through packaging of internet services much like cable TV has been. Those costs will be passed on to the consumer in the form of higher prices for services such as Netflix or Dropbox and probably higher costs for Internet access in general.
The argument is that the free market will let a competitor outperform any ISP that does this but current market reality makes t more likely that in areas with only one real choice for an internet provider, the costs will rise for the average consumer. The barriers to entry for New ISPs are prohibitive as is. 
I have three service providers in my area, and all three raise prices by 10% then there is no real choice. They can do this because if 2 out of 3 providers raise prices then the third will follow because then all three will see increased revenues. The second may wait to see how many subs he first loses and the third may hold out for a while but eventually raise prices as well if the first to raise prices does so successfully. Then there is no choice for a real ISP to compete if they are not already established.
Edit: besides, why would companies lobby for an end to Net Neutrality? The answer is always profits for any publicly traded corporation

It isn’t Bitcoin, it’s a second layer tech for Bitcoin. The coins that are locked up using your private keys are yours and instead of having one transaction on the Bitcoin chain per exchange you can have many. When you want to end the channel you send your last running tally to be added to the Blockchain. There are anti-cheat methods in place to ensure that the transaction that gets posted is the most recent valid tally. The bitcoin in the channels running tally is yours and your counter party’s until you end the channel. Once the channel is ended the transaction is posted and both parties receive the agreed upon amounts

Absolutely. I’ve taken a “Dollar Cost Averaging” approach that’s served me well so far. Definitely good that you’re backing up your seed words. I almost lost 2500 in BTC after losing my seed and having to re-enter my pin on my iPhone wallet at the time. Luckily I slept on it and backed up my phone to save my last guess and got it the next morning.
I use the Ledger Nano S now and can’t be happier

Can you expand this point? I generally thought that google saw no business gain in attempting to provide better service than the incumbent providers with a near monopoly in several large areas. If I am mistaken I am open to an explanation as to how googles failure or abandonment of expanding google fiber proves NN is bad

You invest only what you can afford to lose. I quit a couple of my vices and instead put it into Bitcoin. I would have used the money anyway, but now it's going into a new technology with a huge potential upside in the next few years

I use open source operating systems for my PC and Laptop but use an iPhone. It’s built and does exactly what I need it to do and I just find it suited to my tastes. I’ve had multiple android devices and it just isn’t the same to me. Comes down to preference really
