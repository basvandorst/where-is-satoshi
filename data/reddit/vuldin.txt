Have they changed the name? Nope they haven't. Until it's changed I think pressure from the community is important

You rock sir. I applaud your leap of faith and action.

ultra00, I agree with your point. I'm in the camp of people who don't want to see ads. I want software that will block ads from my browser... not just some ads either. Adblock Plus is not that application. I uninstalled a while back and went to a straight host file mod for a couple of months until I found ABE.
Regardless of "how the Internet makes money" and/or "how the Internet exists", both ideas which are interchangeable among some people, I'm not in favor of a business model where ads are inserted into everything from billboards to commercials to car windows in parking lots to websites and every other conceivable place where there is a chance people will be looking. I'm going to continue to do my part to stop a world like that and block every fucking ad I can in the most easiest and straightfoward way I can find.
If ads are how the Internet currently operates, then we need to get on a different track. I'll be doing my part to ensure this process is sped up as much as possible.

Rarely do spur of the moment actions taken in the middle of the night lead to such a good outcome.

Can I smash someone else's iPhone and still get credit?

Stupid, childish, and mildly entertaining. That about sums up the vast majority of the internet doesn't it? Jump off your high horse and go with it.

I hope you do well. But if there's one thing I hope the most, it's that once you get there you don't start playing politics as usual. Getting elected will be a cakewalk to this task I know, but seriously that's what is needed.

Please point me to where I can push the 'reject trademark' button. My finger is ready.
