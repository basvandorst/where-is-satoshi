I wonder if Fred was tasked with getting enough bitcoins in order for GS to try to manipulate Bitcoin prices on the exchanges?
If GS has enough bitcoins, they can take a short position and then dump a pile of coins on the exchanges and drive the price down, freeing coins from the weak hands to the well-capitalized hands of GS.
The one consolation is the thought of cheap coins.

It just means that a lot of people, US citizens included, would dump dollars for whatever currency would get them bitcoins.
It also means an increase in gold and silver sales as a way to turn dollars into bitcoins: dollars &gt; gold/silver &gt; bitcoins. And back again: bitcoins &gt; gold/silver &gt; dollars.
The government can't do a whole lot about regulating the sale of gold and silver without destroying more of the economy than it already has.

Only you can decide if it's worth it. Many people think Bitcoin has huge potential, some think not. You have to speculate like the rest of us, sad to say.

Digital media is a poor method of longterm storage. I shudder at the thought of leaving coins on a drive of any kind for years without a paper backup.
The irony of Bitcoin is that although it's bleeding edge money, the safest way to store your keys is with ink and paper. Or etched on a stone.

@_date: 2013-04-07 23:01:09
Then the transaction fee is working. It's preventing people from sending tiny amounts and taxing the network. 
I'm of the school that transactions should be more expensive to encourage people to use Bitcoin for transactions above .01 btc and lessen the load on the network.

How hard is this for people to understand:

Blockchain is good to verify a transaction or check a Bitcoin address against a wallet address but it is a website that's just a mirror to the Bitcoin network and will be prone to errors.
If you're handy with installs, you can create your own offline block explorer that reads off your local blockchain copy:

Excellent summary.
My own opinion is that the price of bitcoins has been captured and is being manipulated via Mtgox. The powers that be can't bring down the network but they can put pressure on the exchanges. That people can still get money on and off Mtgox while other exchanges are having their accounts closed is a telling sign to me.

You need your private keys. If you don't have your private keys, you don't have any bitcoins.
You can export the keys from the blockchain.info website and import them into a Bitcoin client at a later date.

In the near future, there will be no online wallets or exchanges. It will be too dangerous when bitcoins are going for $1k apiece. No third party storage will be safe.

I wouldn't argue with that either. It still seems that the price is being manipulated. 
@_date: 2013-04-05 17:58:58
If the government puts the iron hand on Bitcoin, the price will rise as with all contraband in high demand. 
If government doesn't regulate Bitcoin, the price will still rise but not as fast.
The centralizing influences in money and politics are screwed. Some of them are just starting to figure that out.

This is speculation on both of our parts. We'll have to wait and see what happens when the State pulls its old tricks.
I suspect that if exchanges in the US are restricted from trading with dollars, Finland, Iceland or another country (and their currency) more friendly to Bitcoin would fill the void. US law doesn't reach everywhere and fewer countries are willing to cooperate with the insane 'policies' coming out of DC. 
I'll be converting my dollars to whatever currency replaces the dollar in the Bitcoin ecosystem after whatever foolish ruling will come down on high from some commissar in a wood paneled office who can't even turn on a computer.
