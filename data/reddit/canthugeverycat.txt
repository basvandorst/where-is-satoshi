How can they buy bitcoins, if they can't access their money?

I'm not saying the medicine is "icky". I'm saying it might be at best ineffective, at worst harmful. I'm not saying nothing should be done. I'm saying something shouldn't be done just for the sake of doing something. There needs to be a justification to conduct any testing.

Why should your partner care if you should accept dried turds as payment, as long as you can convert the full value to whatever asset you like?

And pretty soon there will be a "Countryman" who bought a small country for 1 BTC, when he could have held on to the coin until 2150 and been a bazillionaire.

That's not what it says, nor what it implies. Maybe it was just an eye-opener for them to the fact that a lot of people are really angry with them, and some of them might even mean serious business.

Kodak were pioneers in digital photography, but they didn't want to compete against themselves and undermine their main source of income - film photography. So instead of moving forward, they tried to stifle progress until someone else just grabbed the ball and ran with it. Thus Kodak did everything to help make themselves obsolete.
@_date: 2014-11-21 17:15:27
Except it's not really hard money nor cold cash.
@_date: 2014-03-08 12:35:09
Mt.Gox was for a long time the only trader I could deposit money to and withdraw money from. For me, at least, being able to deposit and withdraw is a must. I didn't store my coins at Mt.Gox, but I needed to convert some coins to fiat, and my timing was very unfortunate.
Now, tell me how stupid I am, and I will tell you that Bitcoin probably won't gain any mainstream popularity unless regular stupid people can use and benefit from it.

You can trade it for something you want, including government issued currency, so what do you care if it's "real" money?

That's a good point! 100 bits

The phrase "should of" instead of "should have" increases the probability of you dealing with a native English speaker.

Facebook is mentioned at the end of this video. Now, there's a shady business in dire need of regulation.

Maybe we could arrange some treasure hunts. We could post QR codes of addresses with small amounts of money around town. The more people get their hands on bitcoins, the more they will use them.
@_date: 2014-12-12 14:51:09
The original lacks the Bitcoin address, so we're possibly dealing with a scammer.

I'm not saying that at all. He who proposes a medicine for an illness must prove that the medicine is an effective cure for that illness, and without side effects. "More medicine!" isn't the answer when the question is "what does this medicine actually do?"

Money is a concept, and is not tied to the physical object or whatever is used as money. Anything can be money as long as people are willing to use it as such. As soon as you can't use your object (paper bill, gold coin, string of bytes) as money, it ceases to be money.

It's called sequential 3D. First you get the left eye image, and then the right eye image. The upside is you don't need 3D glasses. The downside is you have to watch the whole thing twice, and then puzzle it all together in your head.

Of course Bitcoin could fail. It could fail in virtually infinitely many unpredicted/unpredictable ways. Just like everything else in the universe.
