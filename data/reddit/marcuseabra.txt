Bitcoin and I were born at the same day, January 3rd. How about that? Fate? Lol 
Today I'm buying a brand new apartment... I'm  retired miner and early adopter (Jun 2011).
Happy birthday to us!!

There are plenty of houses in Brazil that you could buy right now with 1 BTC at USD 10k, they aren't mansions nor fancy houses, but they are decent ordinary houses, with kitchens, bedrooms and bathrooms.
So just for sake of the argument, you are wrong and thinking very little, Bitcoin and the world are much bigger than you think, amigo.
I've personaly seen someone buy one house for about 5 thousand US dollars (approximately 0.50 BTC)... I was the one whom lended him half of the money he used to buy the house, so half of half was trully BTC that I had sold to lend him.

No favelas, it was a real brick and cement house, at a small town in the country, Northeast region of Brazil. But I guess you're right, it must be around the same value to buy a similar house in big towns, but probably the only place you would be able to afford would be at the favelas, which only exist in big cities.

Yeah, but the fact they will charge 1% over the tips is definitely not cool!

I'm trying to tip, but it keeps saying I'm doing that too much.

That means financial freedom, my friend! 
Thank you very much for the post. I believe it's important that others keep reporting their stories too so that they work as practical examples. 
I hope cases like yours keep popping up all over the world, so much so that they get picked by big media, then people will truly understand the power of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-11-08 00:05:11
Well, I guess I was too late eh? 
I have got no tips at all :(

I'm trying to apply the promo code BITCOINDEAL and I get this error:

Isn't this discount supposed to be today (Aug 26) and tomorrow? What's going on?

You and your so wise words... Don't you remember what happened before? The damage MtGox already caused us in the past and present? And what exactly did us all learned from MtGox's screwups? NOTHING!!

I have only two concerns with my trezor: 
- sometimes it fails on the browser, it kind of reboot itself or gets stuck... I'm using Opera browser, BTW. I think that needs improvements on that.
- and what if it gets rusted (say I live in a very humid area)? Am I going to be able to retrieve my bitcoins? If so, how? 
Besides that, I'm pretty happy with it.
Thank you.
@_date: 2014-02-26 13:17:49
I agree, and we shouldn't, but the new people they shouldn't see MtGox as an exchange alternative. They need to know that MtGox is bad!! 
@_date: 2014-02-26 14:00:32
Let me give you an example. I've learned about Nazism/Hitler and all those bad deeds and I still remember them today after 20 years I heard of him from the first time. History will be responsible to give them a bad spot and we will all learn from History... Note that I am not suggesting that we erase them from our minds, but to prevent other people to get screwed once again. 
I am on this community for almost 3 years now and, as you, I know a lot about the Bitcoin history, as you, I am a reference to the people I brought in to Bitcoin. Now how come I can say something bad about MtGox if they still seem perfetcly fine to the 'unnaware' public? That's what's needs to be erased.

Fuck the Australian government and their ludicrous regulations. You should buy from a different place/country, here in Canada we do not pay any taxes over bitcoin purchases, at least not now. It's funny how some governments simply don't see what they are loosing by doing such thing.

I've also posted similar concerns 2 days ago. Well, I didn't know (till now) Vitalik and the Poloniex guy were friends.
[Hard/Soft fork is not the point here. What matters is decentralization, and if Ethereum intervene with a fork, they are no better than any conventional bank.](

Way to go bitcoin!!

Satoshi never wanted Bitcoin to be "allowed by the government" in the first place, what puts a precedent to the entire project. 
Perhaps you should follow a private cryptocoin like Ripple and advocate for it, you might get better luck there. 
FYI - there are more "edgies" than you think, and because of bold people like them Bitcoin has gain global respect, without ever asking for any.
@_date: 2016-06-02 16:50:44
I would put the whole $1500 in bitcoin, as long as the money is idling there, you are still pretty young...
I'm pretty sure by the end of 2016 you're going to have a nice smile in your face :)

I'm with you, even if it may take 10 years. Deflation it's a reality in bitcoin world by now, so it won't go back to 500 bucks and it won't stay at 1000.

You gotta love Maloney!! This guy has changed my life and yet I did not even know he knew bitcoin that much.

Sorry, but JUST EAT is pretty much dead to me and plenty of people I know in Toronto. 
I used to use it and it used to be fairly decent, but then the delivery drivers (or not??) somehow started to screw it up, not sure what happened but there is a flaw somewhere (I hope they have fixed it already). 
Late deliveries and arriving cold food start to be a constant thing. I started to add notices saying that I would only tip the drivers if the delivery was within the time JUST EAT says it was. That worked, but it sucks that We The Clients have to come up with solutions in order to make a company's job to work right.  
Then came UberEats which helped disturbing even more JUSTEAT.ca. They say you only realize how bad your service is when you get a much better service, that was what happened to me and now honestly I cannot live without that driver's instant tracking mechanism UE has. I order food pretty much every day nowadays and it has been over 2 months without using JE.ca. 
Sorry but truth has to be told, I like the fact JE.ca is embracing Bitcoin and all, but they need to work in those problems and change their app's interface.
Do not piss off a hungry man!!

I met him at the first bitcoin house (forgotten the name) at Spadina street in Toronto back in Jan 2014 when bitcoin price was slowly starting to fall down, I heard they had this new BTC ATM installed and so I went there to sell 1 BTC and make a thousand Canadian dollars and few days later I was going to Brazil on vacation where I intend to spend that money.
So I ended up meeting Anthony because the ATM was only selling, not buying. So he offered himself to buy from me but before that he asked me "Why are you selling since the price is only going up?". I answered saying the price was too good to be true. So I left the place with 980 canuck bucks on the pocket and I am pretty sure he thought I was stupid. 
Today, almost 3 years later the price still around 1000 can bucks.
My only regret is that I didnt sell all my 100+ BTCs and bought them back a year later for over a third of the price, possibly making over 100k, I am sure Anthony would have bought most of them back then ;)

Exactly, I preach that as well, but to have that mindset people need to trust Bitcoin first and than take advantage of volatility. It's not easy to them as it seems to you and me.

Weren't you not referring to Bitcoin when you made your comment?
@_date: 2017-05-16 21:01:36
No, you're wrong about Bitcoin's past performance  being a confirmation of its deflationary nature.
@_date: 2017-05-16 18:35:33
I guess you were and are still wrong brother 
@_date: 2016-05-05 05:02:04
I believe that a guy like Craig Wright would never make bitcoin an open source project, he would have make bitcoin just another company to his Wright Family Trust.
My two cents.
@_date: 2016-05-06 04:23:25
That's right, we aren't disagreeing. That's why CSW is likely not to be Satoshi (or at least not the head of the Satoshi's group), 'cause he is just a business man, therefore he seeks profit. You have to go beyond just simple profit to come up with something like bitcoin.

I am on bitcoinland since Jun 2011, retired miner and enthusiast. This year I'm trying to live off bitcoin and get out of the rat's race. Lets see what happens...
@_date: 2016-07-09 02:53:44
Not really. The only cryptocoin that was born with a real great purpose was bitcoin. Ethereum was supposed to take over the smart contracts that bitcoin made possible, they've screwed it up (are still?) but still has promises. I'd say there is still a remote chance for one like namecoin and litecoin, and that's all. 
The rest is just stinking crap!!
