If you think that 1000 coins is a big sell wall you must be new here.
There is no proper strategy in the history of Bitcoin that has shown to be effective on holding the price. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:34:19
That is because Bitcoin is under attack. It is not first time and if wont be the last.
They want to control the network and they are coordinated. You must be naive to think that this same think will not happen to any other network that will go that much significant in value. 
By going to any other network you are not solving the problem. Same thing will come after you in due time. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:52:16
Bitcoin is under attack.
There are 2 vectors of attack:
1. Intentionally not implementing Segwit by the big guys as Coinbase, BitPay and Blockchain.info by which transactions would have been handled very easy if Segwit was adopted by them.
2. Coordinated spam transactions that artificially increase the tx volume in order to look as if network cannot handle the traffic. 
Again, if this is not clear, you must be new around here. This things will happen in future again and again. Corporations don't want to have their investment at risk and they want full control over Bitcoin. They cannot do it with Bitcoin and that is why they invented Btrash. End.

In order to get this “Oh F$?c# I hate bitcoin I am never doing that again” Bitcoin needs to go lower than $1300.
I believe We are way past the point where bitcoin can go lower than $4500. Way too much media exposure compared to 1.5 - 2 years ago, fueled with way much more speculative expectations.
Plus more and more new hodlers get the idea of the Hodling and will not sell. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:37:51
Good. Now you can as well switch the reddit channel and discuss on the Altcoin channels you have switched to. 
Bitcoin is not broken. Only thing that is broken is the mental projection in peoples minds of a protocol that works 9 years without any second of downside and without any central point of authority. People tend to seek for authoritarian system so i suggest you seek the same in Btrash or Ethereum or Zcash or whatever alt out there. 
Price of Bitcoin does not reflect the protocol of Bitcoin.
Still 1 BTC is 1 BTC. Still all Altcoins are priced against BTC.
So bottom line, nothing with BTC is fundamentally broken. 
Good luck to you.

So lets see how Gold ETF works: The ETF shares are traded like stocks, therefore their prices fluctuate in a trading day due to supply and demand. Thus, if many investors want to buy an ETF, its share price might rise above its NAV. And when many investors want to sell an ETF, the ETF’s share price might fall below the value of its underlying bullion. Indeed, usually this is the case: higher gold prices trigger unfounded optimism among ETF traders who rush to buy shares, which drives up their prices. Conversely, lower prices drive investors into excessive pessimism. Consequently, they rush in panic mode to sell ETF shares, which lower their prices.

So converted in BTC will be 0.00926.

Which doesn't look that bad.

OK, but this again does not answer the question on how will an average Joe know what to do if we wants to buy some MF Bitcoin?

@_date: 2017-02-13 13:34:20

Ultimate effect will be shifting a huge amount of the demand away from the actual commodity, to the derivative product, which can be printed in unlimited supply.  It also gives them a tool to use for price manipulation.

Buying bitcoin on exchange is totally different with ETF day to day trading. It has nothing to do with Bitcoin ecosystem. It is to put it in simple way: inviting all garbage people playing with its value even though they don't f-ing have a clue what it is!
@_date: 2017-03-24 15:29:36
No, actually everyone should care about their money.
So stating "who cares" it's really no brainier.
Only ones who doesn't need to care are the early adopters who have in their wallets 100s if not 1000s of Coins gained cheep. Like bellow 100 USD cheep. 
Everyone else who jumped on board last few months should care since there is no clear path forward on all this nonsense of Hard Fork (in their asses) thing.

Bitcoin is THE brand of Crypto and will eventually take over the place of PayPal ... Why? Because PayPal is another FIAT driven service that can lock your account or funds without any pre-notice. Sooner people realize this, better for them. 
Store of value role is already in place. Most of the money in are from people realizing this. 
Currency role will take more time. Most probably 5-10 years.

No one likes Bcrap. I don't know any one person in my social reach that is interested in this thing. It is purposely designed to serve Bitmain as a tool to hurt Bitcoin and to show that miners are in charge. They either are influenced by the Chinese government or they  lost their minds over desire for more power. Im sure it is not about money since they make them a lot with Bitcoin already. This coin can exist but its design has no social or commercial purpose. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 17:58:08

In 5-7 Years I see mining operations on corporate and nations level as backup for securing the Bitcoin network. 
In 7-10 Years I see Bitcoin as main asset for store of value suppressing Gold.
in 10-15 Years i see Bitcoin as main reserve currency.
in 15+ years I see major adoption among regular people for daily use of Bitcoin for payments.

As long as the price goes up (which will) more and more merchants/businesses will be forced/interested to implement Bitcoin as payment method. I believe that this will be mostly case in 2018 as hype will increase dramatically.

Usually it should be in opposite order, but since here the mining operations are predecessors I think that adoption as reserve currency or asset will be organic follower.

To be honest I don't care for Bitfinex. Don't like them from the start. But the problem is that if they are pumping the price with this, they can make huge problems for Bitcoin, since price gap cannot be covered that easy if buble bursts sometime in future. Dump of 70-80% will be imminent.

The truth is that Bitcoin made him rich af and he still piggybacks on bitcoins name by using it for his commercial personal purposes through his website bitcoin.com.
He should at least thank to the developers bringing him where he is at the moment by taking care of the code and the network.

The design as per my view should be kept same since most of the Big Miners have setups done according to the Bitmain miners dimensions. This will allow them for easy switch once ready. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 09:59:31
Not exactly technical minded but I can give some thoughts on the overall situation.
1. HODL game is strong with Bitcoin. We have seen that even with this kind of attacks. Hodlers are much more serious than there were few years ago. It seems that week to strong hands play has been happening already at major scale.
2. Bitcoin will face this or stronger kind of attacks in future, the question is how will community response to that? (Look at point 1)
3. Centralized Coins does not have chance against Bitcoin. Nothing to add here.
4. Hyperbitconization needs to happen before layer 2 solutions are deployed. This is mandatory play, there is no way around it. Speculative attack needs to happen before we start using Bitcoin as day to day currency. This is not clear to the Big Blockers since they are focused on fast profits and not on long term fundamentals. 
5. Bitcoin will remain Bitcoin.

Most important indicator for me is the market liquidity.
When shit get ugly, market has no mercy. 
Most of the shitcoins have real big problem with the liquidity. 
One big sell wall and you will see big panic.
Bitcoin is not affected by this in the same way. It is by far margin ahead with the liquidity. 
This is what we call the network effect.

Please read this book before making assumptions that you have learned something of what is money and where is Bitcoin in that picture. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 12:49:35
No it is not.
Basically Crypto exchange will have very limited commercial channels for marketing of their products. Hence very limited window to bring new users on board. Adoption rate and the prices will suffer. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 13:30:37
There is no Power in POW.
There is consensus which is well balanced and no matter on which scale you do the mining, same cost to produce Bitcoins will affect you as any other small miner. Yes depends on the electricity cost and similar but every miner tends to get cheaper electricity. 
In POS, thinking of someone that holds 25.000 BTC, with staking will bring him annually 5 Millions in a year at current price level at only 2% return, without any skin/cost in the game.

I know, that is what you will get as response from Roger. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 13:57:25
Currently there are only 2 profitable Coins with SHA-256, Bitcoin and Bcash.
I'm sure there is no freaking way miners to abandon Bitcoin and move towards Bcash completely. It is not how it works. 
Add to this the difficulty adjustment and profit initiatives, it is really not working like that. 
Bitcoin consensus is really unique thing and defines the economy on completely new level. 
As I said, POS is stupid idea that first does not secure the network and second provides passive income without any skin in the game. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 10:26:43

Sideways action for past few weeks???
Like we literally broke ATH few days ago. What a hell?
Do you expect price to keep goin up?
If you ask me it would be much healthier if we briefly touch 5000 but market does not feel like it.
2013 was The Bubble, you will not see that kind of price pullback in future. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 10:43:46
Nothing. He will be either to dumb (which he is not) to sell all his coins at once since price will dump on the first 10.000 coins so by the time he would get to 100.000 coins price will cripple since there will be no enough liquidity on the exchange. No one sells bunch of coins at once.
So We assume he is smart guy (which he is) and if he wants to sell he will go in waves of small quantities in longer period of time on different exchanges. Which will not be felt by the market at all since market is liquid on this level. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:57:10

This is Correct. As long time eToro user I can confirm this. 
This might happen by start of 2018.

Yes you are correct, but eToro is building unique product/instrument in order to increase interest for new users. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 18:32:04
Here is your answer 
So they will use price index of real exchanges like Bitstamp and similar. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 01:28:44
The only reason to diversify is to try to increase the amount of BTC with short term break out of some of the altcoins against BTC. However this is dangerous game if you don't know how to play it. Hodling altcoins has shown to be a week game so far.

Miners cannot and will not decide which chain is the main chain. That is just stupid. It opens a door of manipulation and uncertainty. Same applies to any economic operators. Main chain should always be the one which is supported by the most developers and also recognized by the  community. Miners should follow the work if they want. If not they can mine something else.

I asked Xapo to define their position on the 2X thing once more via email or else i will deactivate my account and bellow is the answer:
Despite Xapo supporting the SegWit2Mb proposal, if there is a fork in November we will handle it like any other fork and we will continue to support one blockchain - the one with the most accumulated difficulty. Just like we did with Bitcoin Cash we will let our users sell or withdraw the coins they now own on the secondary chain. 
They are Crazy af and my answer is as bellow:
Thanks for your reply.
However if you go by the logic that chain with most hash power is Bitcoin, you will always end that Miners can decide which chain is the Bitcoin. This way we can have Bcash as Bitcoin or Legacy or B2X.
That is just crazy approach since users will never know what to expect.
Clearly main chain should be the chain that users or developers decide or price most and miners should follow the work.  There is no other logical explanation or approach.
@_date: 2017-10-29 11:01:00

Yeah it is still risky and app comes with precaution.
You should try it with small amounts.
Also not much of a LN store options at the moment. It will take some time for more merchants to adopt.

Ethereum insiders gave themselves 12 million ETH at launch, which was never agreed to in the initial crowdsale. ETH is a huge scam piggybacking on Bitcoin invention. Ironically Ethereum’s biggest use case is to facilitate scams (ICOs).

You can't send more than half of your BTC into a channel. So you will need at least 0.002 BTC in your Eclair wallet before you can open a channel with the minimum of 0.001 BTC.

I'm sorry I need to jump in here.
Bcash came out as backfire to the initiative of that camp that Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin. I don't see anyone here stressing out over Bitcoin Gold and calling it Bgold, do you?
So if there will be any other Fork of Bitcoin that will claim it is the real Bitcoin, it will receive the same treatment from the community.
And no this Coin is not and will never be Bitcoin. There is so much money thrown on marketing of Bcash through every commercial channel that is under Vers control and yet 90% of the community is seeing it as Altcoin. So having this kind of attitude where you claim to be smarter than the rest 90% of the people out there is really annoying and arrogant. Go work on the coin, promote it and do whatever you want with it, but don't expect people to agree with your arrogant attitude. 
@_date: 2018-04-10 13:08:06

@_date: 2017-05-16 20:53:03
Bitcoin is not only scaling issue, It is far bigger than that. When did you read something about Litecoin on Reuters say? Does any of your friends know that litecoin exists? How many entrepreneurs and startups are involved in Litecoin ecosystem? 
Does anyone considers Litecoin as store of value or as substituted to Gold? Does Litecoin has enough market reach through exchanges?

1$ :O i will sell my house to buy as much as possible if that happens. But lets be real, it wont, and stop posting stupid assumptions. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 12:38:28
Exactly what I was thinking not so long ago.
There should be some APP that enables automatic buy back for the same amount you are spending. Also provides multiple exchange support so you can choose which one to use, or at least the one you have funds on.

@_date: 2017-07-16 15:25:15
You will never be able to see again price in range of $1000 as much as you would like. I gaurantee this. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 09:51:11
LOL, I bet you had 0 (Zero) BTC.
@_date: 2017-07-21 11:38:10
Great stuff! 
Keep it up! 
@_date: 2017-07-27 14:06:30
If I would have got 1 satoshi for every time I saw this chart compared to Bitcoin, I would have 1 Whole Bitcoin by now. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 13:11:41
How can you consider the longest chain as BTC if economical majority is behind other chain? 
This is totally irresponsible for an exchange like you. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 21:55:21
Ok dude, whatever makes you happy. 
@_date: 2017-05-02 09:41:19
That's because they don't understand the technology behind it and they are either incompetent to look into it or afraid of revolutionary changes. Usually they want to stick to what they know. 
They will learn it hard way.

With current bid volumes, no way it will go bellow 2K.

Just put whatever money you are willing to risk and not touch in next 5 years, and go do some stuff out there in meantime. Don't forget to thank me in 5 years! 
@_date: 2017-07-16 09:28:45
Yep, most corrupted  balkan country says Don't Buy Bitcoin, coz it will crash .. . Gotta listen to them. 
Edit: Same type of warning came from Macedonian Central Bank which is neighbour to Albania and most probably on same  or worst level of corruption and government criminal.

Dude, i lost like $12K with this fall, but i have the same amount of BTC, so sit there tight and wait for the shitstorm to pass.

So big businesses can have fast transactions but me and you not? 
So long of the decentralized peer to peer system. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 19:42:20
It is very very dangerous to sell bitcoin at this period because:
1. Nobody knows what will happen before Aug 1st. With Segwit2x 
2. Split will not happen on Aug 1st and who ever says this does not have a clue about the issue. 
3. If you sell now and Segwit transition goes smooth you will likely have hard time to get in again and buy same amount of coins that you will sell. 
4. Don't sell Bitcoin.
5. Buy Bitcoin at any price bellow $3000 since in 10 years you will be kicking your self why did you calculated if its better to buy at $2000 or $1500.
@_date: 2017-05-23 13:58:43
So this is why scaling issue is not solved on the main chain so private side chains like this can profit?
Great news Bitcoin community. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 10:39:41
Great, nice to hear this. Will order mine. Thanks!

US Dollar is not backed by Gold since 1971.
Before placing some assumptions do some homework. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 13:00:14
You are missing the point.
It is not about race or skin color, it is about political view on things.
@_date: 2017-06-28 19:42:36
No, it is always right time to invest. 
Edit: Invest only what you can allow to risk. 
@_date: 2017-06-24 09:42:41
LoL, from where I come, don't think they know shit about Bitcoin and stuff. 
@_date: 2017-06-24 16:00:27
It's like you keep a secret that you take monthly paycheck or something ... What is so special for someone else to know that you have bitcoin/s? Like they will come and take away from you? Can't they do the same with you Fiat wallet, or physical gold/silver?
@_date: 2017-06-23 18:38:06
Thank You Captain Obvious.

Nope. Sorry wrong guy and wrong prediction. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 10:59:32
Good luck to you buying back at high after 1st August. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 11:49:37
Relax cousin, nothings gonna happen.
Network effect is something that cannot be measured with any market-cap or graph.
You need to understand that BTC is at least 5-6 years ahead of other cryptos. 
There is far more reach, marketing and actual usage on BTC side believe me.
Apart from that BTC is a reserve currency to Cryptos as Gold is to FIAT.

1. Close Bitcoin related stuff. 
2. Go do your own stuff. 
3. Come back in 1 year.
4. Check the price. 
5. Thank me for this.

Well it is basically the raw truth.
Whole worldwide Bitcoin community is in limbo due to one China miner.

Bitcoin is not your regular stock trade so fundamentals does not apply here. It is very dangerous thing to short BTC these days and everyone knows it.
This is why market seems confused not knowing where to go before Aug 1st.
