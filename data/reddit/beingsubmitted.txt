He stated that it was made to facilitate illegal transactions. You asked if he also condemns criminals hiding anne frank from the legal authorities. I'll tell you what, why don't you tell me what you think you were saying.

There are times when something is morally right, but illegal. Using an example of that to make the case that everything illegal is morally right is asinine.

Oh, that's right, you just chose that point in the conversation to say something completely unrelated, you weren't drawing an analogy saying that since the one thing is illegal but moral, the other thing is also moral. But you're right, if you had done that, your strawman argument would have been asinine.

On coinbase, all of your buying and selling from a bank account will take about a week. It's definitely normal. If you use a debit card, you can make an instant buy, but you're very limited in how much you can buy. You can also sell and buy to your USD wallet instantly. Coinbase just doesn't want to give you a bunch of bitcoin, have the price change, and then have the transfer rejected by your bank.

When the price drops, it's a good opportunity to buy more.. psychologically, it helps you cope with dropping prices, even if you're buy $5 at a time.

While the only real answer is "perceived value," a change in perceived value is generally tied to something. In this case, most analysts seem to be pointing to 3 factors: Depreciating Chinese Yuan, threat of "Brexit" (I hate myself for typing those letters, gross), and impending halvening. Underlying that is appreciation from more people actually using bitcoin as currency.

I don't want to speak exactly to your question, just point out that it seems to contradict itself. You're calling for unity and cooperation in an agreement to not unify and cooperate. Which do you want, unity and cooperation, or decentralization?

Price drop? I call it a sale.

Wouldn't it be awesome if there was a cryptocurrency with stable value, that would allow you to enter into what I'll call a "contract," where given a certain situation, the currency would be distributed in a transparent fashion, without the need for trust?

Saying he's not allowed to move the coins out of the country is a strange thing. The coins are in all countries at all times, but I guess selling to a person outside the country would qualify in this case.

When a person "cooks up" in a Walmart bathroom, they're talking about dissolving a drug in water for injection, not making meth.

This is Timothy McVeigh. He wanted to make the world a more peaceful and safer place by dialing a phone number that would detonate car bombs near a government building and inspire people to rise against oppression for a better world. He was executed, and all he did was dial a phone number.
