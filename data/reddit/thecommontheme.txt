I was under my parents insurance and did not want their insurance to go up. Believe me, I know now what I should have done. I didn’t want the cops to come and for my parents to find out. I was a stupid kid. Made mistakes, but you’re totally right, it’s ridiculous when I think about it now and how much it would have saved me

Much appreciated man, thank you for the kind words.As soon as I get things going again I will be throwing in money like no tomorrow. Sucks that I had so much of it and now only have two, but just supporting the tech is a big deal to me.
Good luck on the journey, man!

Glad you read my story, most of it was spent to help a friend as I mentioned, I don’t regret it. Sure it would have been nice to have the money and I kick myself over it but I’m left re-buying at these levels. I’m sure a ton of us have similar stories. 
I couldn’t justify not helping out a friend, unfortunately in the long run it didn’t matter but I’m left building up now.
Great story man. Looking forward to the bitcoin journey together!

That is not true. They were absolutely used in the bitcoin forums in 2011. A quick search pulled up a thread as well. The term was used, see below:
Regarding the subreddit, not sure what you are insinuating. If you want to doubt that, I guess that’s fine, but that’s the truth, really unsure why you would write a comment like that

If I had received bitcoin for how many threads were started today asking if it was worth it, I would have about 7.265 bitcoin

Nice, actually picked up the WSJ today because I wanted to read this article. Long live the bitcoin, HODL!

Reminds me of the Banking on Bitcoin documentary on Netflix, they talk about the same thing.
