Reagan set back libertarianism by 50 years.
Yes, taxes shrink the economy. But government spending is also a tax, so you must reduce both taxes *and* spending to grow the economy. 
When shrinking taxes, doing it strictly for highly regulated cronies does not spur the economy much at all.
Starting 100 unnecessary wars overseas does not result in long term benefits.

This USA is preeminent militarily - and this arises from its own internal GDP.
You underestimate the power of the american empire, imo.
The amazing military, social, and economic power it has it uses to shape the rest of the planet.

It had been a thought since long before the civil war; but a National Fiat was a first huge step away from the founder's anti-bank vision, and ultimately formed the basis of the Fed.

Might be a bit premature to expect that - its has enormous reach.
* All the prices denominated in dollars
* All the wages denom in dollars
* All contracts with dollar amounts
* All the laws/fees/taxes/regs denom in dollars
* All the stocks/assets/markets that trade in dollars
* All the savings accouts/sset pools only denom in dollars
All of these need to have a reasonable and usable alternative before the petrodollar can even flinch.
for over 150 years the USA has removed multi-currency trade from our culture.
The dollar could lose 50% of its value and people would still not have an easy way to get off the roller coaster.
at perhaps 80% or 90% loss of value, massive societal collapse aside, people would be working hard on alternatives of all kinds, while most everyday people would simply lose everything.
Unless such a catastrophy hits, it make take another 100 years for people to organically enable alternatives throughout the ecosystem.

If the real concern is that there could be "stuck" transactions due to a software bug not putting enough salsa onthe TX, there are far better ways to fix it.
One way: could be a conditional subsidy, like a transaction that goes 100% to the miner, and depends upon the other transaction being confirmed. 
honestly not too hard to implement, and fully opt-in with no chances of double spend attacks like RBF.

Truly, I think you are underestimating the power of this change; 
The various network scaling attacks the, the malleability attacks, and the difficulties with side-chains, lightning chains, etc are all alleviated by seg-wit.
One of the reasons why the dev's have been resistant to blocksize changes is because spamming and network attacks benefit more from it than legitimate traffic.  Prematurely upping the blocksize would be a disaster. 
Once the pre-requisites are in place, and the need is evident, blocksize change will more ahead at an appropriate speed.

If bitcoin was a fairly mature, boringly well understood, non-speculative market you would be right.
If you were to take a survey of all the people who own or trade in bitcoin to see if they know what a "halvening" is, which percentage do you think would know ?
I would expect the market for satoshis is largely driven by speculation, hype, misinformation, or absolute need. I suspect very little is driven by educated understanding of the technology, and price models of future reward regimes.
Thus I agree with the GP post: it is very likely that following a halvening, assuming no other major factors, we might have a market shock cause by a sudden supply drop.  This may possibly include another bubble considering bitcoins current level of media coverage, the "halvening" could be pushed on sites like forbes, causing a price surge/crash.

Stealthcoins are ironically anti-privacy using this standard, since it prevents coin-joining.
Using a bip32 xpub instead of a single address or a stealth root is a nicer way to have stealth transactions without the extra complexity. never reusing an address gives just as much anonymity, and doesnt require a special transaction structure so you can join transactions duing normal spends.

And yes, it is genius to merge the concept of hashcash, merkel trees, ecdsa chained signature transactions, post-quantum resistance, infrastructure building rewards, and a truly innovative p2p solution to longstanding compsci problem in state synchronization.

@_date: 2014-12-04 21:51:39


That is true, but there are other and imo better mechnisms for consumer protection than the credit fraud protection model, such as the fact that you have to authorize every purchase, and a its not possible for anyone to "pull" funding from you.  This feature of bitcoin alone virtually obviates the need for credit card fraud protection in common F2F in-store sales. For internet sales, merchant can offer refunds, and 3rd parties can offer escrow/arbitration, and at far lower rates than credit cards charge. 
 
There are other factors as well, which I think eradicate the business model driven by the ability to print debt; if the credits cards offer hard current it cannot be fractionally reserved if those with accounts choose not to leave deposits in trust. Much of the risk mitigation in instant credit derives from the imaginary nature of the money at put risk. If hard currency has to be placed in jeopardy of default, the lendor can quickly find themselves insolvent.
The marginal cost to verifyably withdraw cash or gold is quite high. The marginal cost to verifiably withdraw bitcoin is none or very low. When there is no downside, depositors will choose to withdraw, I suspect. Most especially if there is any hint of a crisis or shortfall. 
So, while I do think there will be bitcoin credit cards, I think they will likely be for OBC micro-payments only. I think their margins will be far thinner. The future of mastercard and visa may be something more like changetip, and less of a titan of industry.
And this is ok: things get better, and productivity improvements that destroy one market create many new ones.

"a stealth -&gt; join -&gt; stealth" transaction chain looks like a dead giveaway, unless the majority of transactions on the blockchain follow that pattern, you will actually be making yourself fairly easy to follow. (it would undo tumbling fairly effectively, even after several hops)

A few critical mistakes have to be made to enable this:
* Address re-use. Dont reuse multi-sig P2sh, or any address 
* Blindly signing a fully formed transaction. The best thing to do is always structure the transaction in your own trusted software. It should match if all parties are honest. At a minimum validate the structure sent by a non-trusted party.
@_date: 2014-12-28 19:55:52
Your setup is wacky.
* Multi-sig is not a security feature, its an escrow feature
* extended public keys can leak all your private keys, so be aware of that risk. Only export xpub's of your hot-wallet, keep your cold wallet's xpub private.
* Multi-sig is a not a backup feature. a back up of your private keys is exactly equivalent to your setup.
You have added a bunch of complexity, and will be spending extra on transaction fees, for no real benefit.
Get a trezor, or set your airgapped machine up with a simple bip32 wallet and you will have the exact same security profile less all the complexity. you can use one account (0') for cold and one (i') for hot, perhaps.

depending on how your cold wallet is structured you have two options:

I use both.
The second one I use for half-way cold storage. (I make an offline transaction to break a big coin into several reasonable (~ 100 mbtc  ) smaller coins, then I print a couple private keys on paper as an easy quick importer tool. (they are like self-printed bitcoin cash, pretty cool.

In general, there isnt. Bitcoin is never going to make traditional fiat frac-reserve banking better. The limitations of legacy banks and the limitation of legacy currency are fundamental. 
Earning and spending directly in bitcoin is the best way to avoid unnecessary conversions. By needing and wanting to both start and end with fiat cash, the only thing bitcoin adds is the ability to cross borders that would normally be regulated/illegal or otherwise have currency controls or very high official markups.
Want to move 1million USD worth of local fiat out of a country with currency controls ? bitcoin can do that, assuming you have some way to buy it in the first place. Any markup from LBC is acceptable, because there isnt any alternative.

Isnt privacy sufficiently handled with a single blockchain ?  its pretty easy to obfuscate identity, as is.
The reason a forky treechain is weaker than the unichain is the same reason the blockchain is strong to begin with; the more centralized power against the central ledger the better the central ledger. Its a consensus activity. Youve certainly heard of the byzantine generals problem; Why undo that and allow the generals to make separate plans again?

A "coin" is an object on the blockchain with a value.
Colored coins are normal coins, which people have associated real world things with.
There are rules for how these coins can be spent, to make sure the company can keep track of who has what shares.
For example: 
A company uses 100 mbtc to create 50 coins each worth 2mbtc. The company declares that anyone who can prove ownership of those coins owns 2% of the company.
Owners of the coins can spend them as per usual, but they must follow certain rules designed to keep track of the provenance of each share in the company.

Some buzz, excitement builds up, crazy stories of big money, a huge scandal and a collapse, then everything is back to normal, the collective world-view is affirmed, and a soft chuckle at the losers who lost everything for greed.

You have defined a bit of a catch 22.
FYI BIP38 has two modes:
* Generating random keys (you cannot control which key comes out really) so not useful
* Encrypting existing keys
An electrum seed is only 16 bytes or 128 bits equivalence.
For example: "nothing belief whistle nod cruel expect tap soul snake marry clean however" is equal to: 0xf13e5a21ea250d349660d0cc35b189f4
However, bip38 uses scrypt and AES to encrypt 32 bytes of data.
So, to encrypt it with BIP38, first you would have to pad it out to the size of a bitcoin private key, perhaps with zero's. 
Next you would have to choose a suitable password. I would argue, that your password should be at least 128 bits in strength. In order to make a secure password strong enough to protect what you want to encrypt, you should use something like electrum to make one for you, then use it as the BIP38 password. 
Now you are protecting one electrum passphrase with another electrum passphrase... you might as well have simply memorized the first one and skipped all this.
However, if you want to memorize a much smaller password, please remember that while BIP38 is strong today, it wont be forever, becaues many people are working on hardware scrypt. You can choose a shorter passphrase for bip38 if you must.

The only difference from a pure ponzi scheme is that they actually have a source of income to pay off the investors: taxes. They will forcibly rob people to pay back their debts. 
If interest rates start rising, and the treasury faces an insurmountable need to expand debt beyond the ceiling (leading shortly to collapse of the system) the govt always has the option of extreme spending controls, radical taxe hikes, or the obvious: outright printing the cash to pay off the debt. 
All of these have fairly obvious side-effects and consequences, and none of them are desirable. The destruction of the dollar via hyper inflation is bad. The destruction of the credit rating of the US government is bad. The destruction of the economy via hyper taxes is bad. 
The typical choice is steady inflation, as it is the least painful, works quite like compound interest, and you can always have the OBM report fallaciously low "official" inflation numbers.

you are both right. 
People who dont "get it" hear bitcoin people talking and all they can hear is "scam victim" "shill" "kool-aid drinker" and all other kinds of crazy that are usually associated with fad chasers or the misinformed. They instantly feel sorry and dismissive of those who seem to be misguided. To be fair, there is no shortage of scam victims and other hype-followers out in the world, so its a real instinct.
But for those who do get it, bitcon is the future.
To me, it reminds me of the early unix days. Once you get unix, all other operating systems seem to be trash. You cannot imagine how other people dont see it, and are continuously surprised by how long it seems to take for unix to take over all computers. 
Mind you, I wasnt wrong about unix, but windows and other junk OS's have lived quite long beyond what I would have anticipated. In the darkets days before linux but after the demise of xenix, I nearly gave up hope for humanity. But we pulled through and now there is android, apple crap, linuxes and all kinds of unix everywhere. Its not yet a total victory, but clear vindication.
If bitcoin follows any similar adoption curve, then I'd expect the same long wait for the average person to wake up, the same dark days where it seems that all is lost. I'll hodl to the very end nonetheless, because I beleive in it. 
The buttcoiners and nay sayers of today will never be called to task. They will never be given a proper "i told you so", because noone remembers nay sayers. It may be 20 years before the happening, before we hit the bitcoin singularity. but hopefully ill be alive to see it.

They support something very similar, but I think it is a predecessor to bip39.
BIP39 seems to be a bit overwrought, and it specifies some truly strange things such as mandatory NFKD decomposition. (meaning its very difficult to make a fully compliant implementation because unicode is always changing. And a security library should have quite so many external dependencies.)
the electrum mnemonic method is more suitable for standardization imo,  while bip39 is simply overcomplicated

If you administer your own server, and neither platform re-uses an address or destination, it is likely anonymous. (to be clear, many of these schemes seem to reuse addresses heavily making them not very anonymous at all)
To provide any additional defense against compromise, you would need to carry two phones of a different platform, such as one iphone and one android. Or one phone and a laptop. EVEN then, two general purpose devices splitting the job of not getting compromised is still inferior to a single dedicated hardware device that cannot be compromised.
Multi-sig is really great for arbitration of trades between two strangers and one partially trusted party. (with a fully trusted arbiter it is still not that useful honestly, which is why the majority of low-trust high risk bitcoin trades dont bother with multi-sig)

But, you would never give the same xpub to two different senders, or even the same sender for different purposes if you want to keep the transactions separate.
Also, xpub's used as payment books should have a hardened separation to compartmentalize them. (since they contain a chaincode)
For example, if you have Client1, Client2, and Product1, and Product2, then
you could create 4 payment books:
* xpub(Client1, Product1) = m/44'/0'/0'/10'
* xpub(Client1, Product2) = m/44'/0'/0'/11'
* xpub(Client2, Product1) = m/44'/0'/0'/12'
* xpub(Client2, Product2) = m/44'/0'/0'/13'
The clients can pay you for the appropriate products, and can only see what they individually already knew (what amounts they sent to what addresses for what purposes) Each xpub is good for ~2 billion payments.
Each payment is joinable, since it has no special restrictions on the transaction structure.

There is no special privilege for them, and they can only spend the money once.
* they are not earning interest on their holdings
* they cannot print new bitcoins, only spend what they have
* the economy functions whether they spend or not; they cannot cause a liquidity crisis
* deflation has a fixed impact, because there is no cascade of loan collapse causing a satoshi pinch
* any loans or investments require true risk of loss

Their joiner is technically correct, but there are some obvious weaknesses which seem to make it useless:
* Failing to ensure that there is no obvious correlation between the amounts of all the inputs and outputs
* Allowing a noticeable velocity difference between pools of coins, and reusing the same streams of value for hotmixing.
Having the amounts correlate so simply - this made your source and dest stand out like sore thumbs. For normal spends, choosing the most similar coin is ideal. For Joins, a stronger joiner will allow you to choose an arbitrary coin, and allow you to receive some of the value back at a one or more fresh change addresses. There should be no obvious correlations
A bunch of high speed hot wallet coins mixed  a normal spend dont look anything alike. They are re-using a pool of obvious btc hot wallet coins. While at least they are not re-using addresses, a real joiner will mix legit transactions together, not fold real transactions into a bed of obviously fake ones. This might mean waiting a long time for a join to even start, perhaps an hour or so, until suitable real spends can be found.

Yes, that is true, but it wont be the same as the seed generated from the american worldlist. Also, I'd have to have a wallet restore feature which fully understand Japanese input, and knows how to convert it to NFKD (most japanese systems use only NFC)
So most of the benefit of having a word-list independent root secret generation is lost (if the implementation is standard compliant) If you ignore the unicode normalization part, it works slightly better, but you lose the checksum validation.
IMO, they should drop the normalization and the brainwallet style PBKDF2 step, and simply populate the language wordlists earlier, in whatever unicode form is most common for said language.

"Trusted computing" is also typically used for DRM systems, meaning architecturally it was designed to track and limit users not help them. Signed tamper resistant code to check the user's identity and licenses, its isnt designed to be cryptographically protected, but instead the boot loader protection is setup such that it cannot be bypassed.
Trying to turn that on its head and use it for the user's benefit would need some additional features, first and foremost either some kind of secure storage, and in addition some kind of secure user input method. lacking either of those means its not really suitable as a vault for the user's private keys, and there is no safe path to unlock them and use them without both the OS and the various android backdoors having access to the goods.

Imagine a big public board game, with no secrets or hidden parts. Every last piece in on the board, and thousands of players have a full copy of the whole game. Each position on the board is a puzzle.
Each game piece's location is a puzzle, and the solution to that puzzle lets you move the piece to a new location, changing the puzzle needed to move it again. Each piece has a denomination, relative to the other pieces. Some are worth very many satoshi, some very few. Some solutions you can memorize. Some are very complex, and you need to write down or store in a computer. Pieces can be combined together or split apart when they move.
Each location/puzzle can be re-used, but there are so many location they never have to be re-used.
Noone really owns the pieces like you might own a bag of potatoes by holding it in your hand. But if you are the only person who knows the solution to the puzzle for a location, its just the same as if you control the value denominated by all the pieces in that spot.
Its possible that many people know the solution to a puzzle. Its possible, when moving the piece, to have its new puzzle be one you can solve again, that someone else can solve again, or that noone, any one, or many can solve. Its possible to forget the solution. Its possible to forget the solution and have someone else learn it, effectively changing the owner, but it a way that the piece didnt even move. Conversely, the piece can move, and stay with the same owner. Many people can moe their pieces at the same time, and its hard to tell who move which pieces to where.
Its difficult to prove whether someone knows the solution to a given puzzle, unless they choose to prove it. Even if you know the position of every piece on the board, its impossible to know how many people could move a given piece, or how many pieces a given individual can move. And both of those factors could change even if the pieces didnt move. But some the pieces are always moving, and many are being destroyed and created all the time, so its virtually impossible to say who controls what.
Pieces are "coins", the puzzles are usually addresses, and solutions are signatures. Ownership is a concept that doesnt fit in well.

A good tumbler would mean that a significant fraction of the money supply is now tainted with your coins. That means they could belong to anyone.

Which of the (a,b,c,d) have bob's money and which have yours? impossible to tell. Worst case you have to follow all 4btc of value now.
 Rinse and repeat that operation 4 more times. Now your original 4 btc of value is conflated with 256 BTC of other people money.
If everyone tumbled each transaction, it would be even harder, as the trail would never end. Even better; ending address re-use.

Youd be better off allowing BIP32 address generation, encouraging users to never re-use an address, and allowing users to regenerate lost/missing root keys offline, etc etc.
If you offer a banking wallet with OBC transactions, them mark the coin values clearly separate from coins only held by the user. 
Go beyond just 2FA, especially the easily hackable 2FA based on cell phones. Ask users to buy a keyfob for it, and have heuristics to detect unusual spending patterns or amounts. Also, warn them off of windows, and encourage strong password entropy the right way.

Mycelium does something which I think causes the confision: They take the english version of the mnemonic through pbkdf to generate the master secret rather than simply using the binary master secret as is. I dont see any crypto graphic benefit to this step, and it is what causes some of the confusion you are seeing. (This step is called for by bip39, however)
1. I18n is still possible to use other languages in bip39, even with the english specific pbkdfg step: I18NPHRASE -&gt; Binary -&gt; English -&gt; PBKDF -&gt; Master secret. The way mycelium is written this wont actually work, but a minor fix to their code and it would.
Regarding your points about recovery: mycelium stores **the** master secret, so the current account and all future accounts can be created and used on the one device. So separate accounts are only useful to help organize your coins, there is no security advantage to making a new account. 
What mycelium fails to support is multiple master secrets. A real "new account" feature would generate or ask for a new master secret, IMO.

More critically, I've noticed that multisig is commonly seen in a way that induces a false sense of security in many, and users will tend to neglect the more important security measures because of it. This is also true of 2FA, which I believe to be a negligible security factor as well.

Presumably. Could be quite tough for audits, both for the auditor to be satisfied, and for the auditee to prove full compliance. both because of cash and crypto.
Lets say a cash for btc transaction happens, 300 mbtc for 100 aud.
When the trader goes to deposit cash, he could deposit 100 AUD,  the full amount. He could deposit 120 AUD, because he had another 20 in his pocket randomly. Or he could deposit 80 aud, because he bought something on the way to the bank with cash.
because hypothetically, each crypto transaction could send outputs to a key controlled by any unknown party. For example, a transaction that spends 700 mbtc, 300 to key A, 400 to key B,  could be a sale of 400 mbtc with 300 mbtc change. Or a sale of 300 with 400 change. 
An auditor could contend: the trader claims to have sold 400, but actually kept the 400 as change and only really sold 300, that there is an invisible 100 mbtc profit. It could be difficult or impossible to prove otherwise for a number of reasons.

Multi-sig doesnt prevent that at all, most not especially when both keys are on the same computer.

If your category includes "all forms of money other than barter" then bitcoin is **already included** in your set of "real money" and your question makes no sense whatsoever. you do understand bitcoin is not like bartering eggs and bread.
Can you explain what exactly we are comparing bitcoin to ? Perhaps I was wrong to assume you meant "fractional reserve, electronic, national fiat debt based currency".
You do realize than "money" already has many different types and technologies, and bitcoin is not the first money related invention.
@_date: 2014-06-04 22:03:03
Yes, bitcoin users are more risk averse; they use wallet software that tells them their balance. Some shady website telling them they have some balance wont be trusted, not to a significant extent.
Investing in a small business will still happen, whereas investing in the abstract via a CD or money market account will make less sense. Doubly especially so in that the banks have zero ability to sustain a run. (the market shakes; all depositors want to withdraw for a few days for their own peace of mind; the money has been spent on business capital assets, the bank thus has no way to materialize the withdraws; poof under they go )
The above property means the money supply is really not expanded at all; unless investors know that there is no way to instantly withdraw ; which means stocks are not anything m1 or m0. Illiquidity means investment must be for longer terms for better understood stocks, and less so for well known abstract mega companies of now dubious liquidity. This will likely lead to smaller companies, as blue caps will be less competitive for capital.
And yes, private banks lending and redepositing creates our current bubbly money system. all the money is fake, but the debts are real. Its how semi-centralized fractional reserve works. (fully decrentralized frac reserve caused some pretty interesting chaos back in the day)
But bitcoin is a new math; you truly need to think through the consequences more deeply than simply assuming the old systems will work as they ever have. It has properties that previous system of currency do not possess.

Absolutely. the real "velocity of money" with bitcoin is quite low, because relatively few coins are being used either for purchases or exchange with other currencies, relative to the total number that theoretically exists.


I suspect it is even higher.  If you assume flat market interest, and a flat dollar strength, then you could measure the inflation directly: roughly 60%.
Market cap is much harder to calculate then most assume. Its is easy to compute the dollar spot price time the number of satoshi, but that is a rather useless number, for the same reason: if most of the shares arent available at any price , they really dont contribute to the cap.
Imagine a corporation reporting a billion anonymously owned ghost shares of itself that it will never trade, to inflate its apparent market cap. I suspect that was never a pool of 14 billion usd equivalent value in the btc market.

Both TREZOR and mycelium and possibly some other BIP44 wallets formats are not a bad choice, in terms of wallet recoverability.
If you can remember your 12 word recovery passphrase, then you dont have to worry about the hardware or services failing ever, and you will always be able to recover your BTC with only your memory.
(I was able to prove this to myself by writing a small program which can regenerate the bitcoin keys exactly matching what the mycelium and trezor wallets generate.)
Honestly, I would never use's trezor's webwallet for spending any money however, but I'm sure by the time you are ready to spend there will be numerous options for how to spend TREZOR wallet coins.
the key part is this: absolutely memorize in your mind the 12 word phrase. I wouldnt suggest writing it down. Just memorize it to death and back, and test yourself once a week to make sure you still have it in your mind.
Next, recover the wallet, generate about 100 RX addresses, and destroy the wallet/ get reid of the hardware.
Then you can feel safe depositing to those addresses, and deleting any physical evidence that they exist. and freely go off the grid for as long as you like.
(to minimize risk, you could try to memorize multiple 12 word phrase, and spread your money between them)

By who's math ? Why not also throw in the price of all the shoes in the country, or nickelback albums. When we talk about bitcoins, the supply is fixed and calculable precisely by anyone with a fullnode. There is no fuzzy math of debt expansion and contraction.
Goods of any kind, including securities, can in no way affect the satoshi supply. (bar mining)
Demand can vary, and so can velocity, but in the case of bitcoin, supply is quite simple.
Sticky prices and sticky wages will help form a larger stability bulwark for btc, once more salaries, dividend and prices are denominated in satoshis. It will still trend to "deflationary" over time, which will arguably support a constant demand, higher than that of fractional reserve notes.

So Marc hasnt thought out the implications perfectly, but he is still a very smart guy.
The blockchain is public, but in a way that is very difficult to force identity onto.
Each coin is destroyed in a transaction, and entirely new coins are mixed and minted, which dooms any sort of coin-identity program (because it would require total cooperation all the time) while enabling chosen non-anonymity like colored coins (which only require partial cooperation of the motivated)

Dollars are in most cases integers in a computer and they can be set to whatever value the computer's operator decides to.

Exactly! I am an adherent of the moon as well, but I dont really see real time in-store purchases as the best app for bitcoin. I dont think we should go to the global blockchain for every tiny transaction. Pre-purchasing a big lot of store credit then having instant spending, OBC micro-transactions, etc makes more sense.
Business to Business clearing is much more interesting, since the lower frequency and higher value amount make more sense for direct spending on the blockchain. I could see waiting 1hr for 6-conformation on a truck full of pallets worth of goods, or a whole shipping container.


And of course that is the real driver of value. Personal or company wealth, invisibly carryable, no value cap, world-portable, deflationary store for the future. 
If I take a deep draught of the kool-aid, I would predict that holding bitcoin will replace most forms of anonymous stock and bond investing, since a deflationary cash-equivalent would be safer and more reliably lucrative than any random stock or bond. Only targetted investment in a company you have deep knowledge and personal participation in could outpace it.

noone will pay interest on bitcoin for deposits, 
because noone will deposit,  because the risk of losing all the coin far outweighs the piddly interest.
I see that you are really hopeful for a fractional reserve of bitcoin, and who knows, 
maybe some bank will truly become trusted enough for one to exist, but I highly doubt it.
Mt GOX was pretty much trying to do it, and though the effort went on for a couple years, and you can see how it doesnt work in the end.
tranditional banking only works because they can effectively shred the cash you deposit, and print new cash upon demand. The integers in the bank's computer are what cash is, even more so than the paper money. Ever try to buy something with 500K cash ? You cant. Only with a bank account can you move that much green.
Bitcoin is the opposite; you can easily move 500k in btc. but noone will accept that much btc in goxbux, or whatever your theoretical bank rebrands its BTC reserves into.

It can be the only one you will every need; because it can generate an endless number of private keys.

That would be potentially dangerous, because it would not generate the same phrase on other devices per se.  Unless you can recognize and normalize the words, you dont knwo what wallet you are going to get.

That would work if the PBKDF step was missing. Since it doesnt happen at every key derivation step, then is no way to import a child private directly.

d) electrum on ubuntu would beat either handily. android is probably second place. windows is hopeless, nothing electrum can do about it.
e) In your mind. Warning, each can only be used once, so bip38 is honestly rather weak. I'd recommend memorizing an electrum seed instead, then exporting individual private keys to paperwallets or directly into mycelium. Remember to use each key only once.

your old boss was wrong, and that aphorism is dated.
2FA can have a role, but its more of a headache and compatibility problem than it is worth,
and it usually runs on a weak client making its addition to the security paradigm a net negative.
(a false sense of security)
The tales of how many people with 2FA gone still getting robbed should have clued people into the fact that this is a fad, but it lives on...
Security is:
* A secure protocol for the login
* a trusted non compromised client terminal
* a high-entropy secret.
To do these:
* Use a real wallet (electrum), not a web wallet 
* no windows or mac
* machine generated, human readable words, &gt;= 128 bit strength
In comparison, 2FA is nothing. But its attractive to people who dont want to deal with the somewhat more challenging reality. No you cant keep your swiss cheese windows machine, web based wallet, and short to type password, and expect the magic of 2FA to keep the monsters away.

Agreed, good points, esp about self defence.
I think Friedman mentioned in his book that it is impossible to end socialism with armed revolution, since that goes against the core tenets of capitalism. I think he either inferred or alluded to the fact that it is equally impossible via the voting booth.
Both voting and rebelling are acts of violence inflicted upon others in order to force your will upon them, and both inevitably end back where they started. Any politician who can get elected democratically will owe enough favors to special interests to prevent him/her from truely dismantling govt or delivering on promises.
Gandhi's method of change; individual nonviolent behavioral changes could work, if enough individuals participate. The factors preventing this from happening are the same factors that impede free markets:
* Not enough free exchange of information between participants
* lack of critical thought among participants
* insufficiently liquid medium of exchange among participants
* lack of privacy of transactions
I think the internet can solve the information exchange problem (decentralizing news). It will also help future generationt to be less indoctrinated, i would hope. Personal crypto can start to solve the privacy problem - but it would be better if it was more ubiquitous. And bitcoin might be the solution for the ability to privately/secure perform trades/exchanges, assuming it remains strong cryptographically.

The problem is not the trezor itself being vulnerable, its your other peripherals. Imagine a vulnerable mouse capturing all your keystrokes on your computer, then storing them and secretly embedded them on a USB or somewhere to later be sent to an adversary. 
If you use a trezor carefully, perhaps you can do so without ever putting sensitive information into the computer... If the trezor doesnt use bip070, a nastry usb key could try to change the destination address of spend requests, and steal your money that way.

It doesnt do anything to the exchange value of BTC. The total number of blocks mined wont change by much because they network will adapt to the growth rate with increased difficulty.

You dont have to be a government agency to see the litecoin (or other alt) blockhain. 
\if you see btc move into a known exchange wallet, you can look for similarly size transaction groups on the altchain, based on the current price. most likely it follows a few hops on a low volume exchange, then come back out on another coin's chain. 
Its the exact same technique as used for following the btc blockhain.
tainted coin goes into an exchange's wallet,. next look for a similarly sized transaction on the altcoins blockchain and continue following the money from there. With so much less data to sift through, it should be easier. 
If you happen to get privileged data from the exchange, then its trivial.

If the operating system is compromised, its really no problem to intercept any and all keystrokes, and all bytes going over the usb bus in general. 


Security is about layers, absolutely. Layers that add headches and complexity for users are a net negative however. Unmemorizeable or over-frequently cycled passwords are one well known example. 
Warning dialogs that pop-up too frequently inure users to always click "OK" and ignore the warning. 
Systems that require over-frequent PIN input cause users to input their PIN without thinking about it too much. Hell, it could be possible to exploit these purely visually, by showing a PIN entry dialog.


So you have an emotional investment in this tech and will tend to be defensive.
I would like you to consider that allthough they may add complexity, simple dongles depend fully on the host operating system to provide security. Complexity/ systemic obfuscation has never proven to be a defense. 
I still think it is unsafe to use a trezor on windows, it at least theoretically provides a mechanism for defense. But it assumes that the user is vigilant about reading destination addresses. It would take very little for a sneaky windows malware to wait for a normal transaction, re-write it to a sweep at a hostile destination, and hope the user doesnt notice until it is too late.

But the big questions for the TREZOR user community remain:
* Will there be a new build with constant time ECDSA ?
* Will the PIN code be updated to make it unglitchable ?

 perhaps you should re-read.
A trezor is strictly superior to a smartcard in every way right now.
@_date: 2015-01-11 17:32:36
Trezor has a screen and button and thus gives you security without relying upon your computer. So it is a true hardware wallet. Ledger is not.
The magic of a hardware wallet isnt some chip you can plug in, its a dedicated interface for input and output that cannot be modified. 
you still have to pay attention to the screen, and read the destination address carefully. And you have to be careful not to hit the wrong button. 
With ledger and smartcard wallets, you have to trust the computer you plug it into completely.

Would a hostile host computer attempting to perform hamming weight timing guesses against the private key not be a viable attack? (is there some way to determine accurately the period of time taken by a sign request, assuming the host PC is fully hostile down to the O/S level) if there is no way to distinguis between the UI time needed to push the ok button vs actually signing this might be challenging.
But if it could, the attack program would get a new measurement for every signature, and once it gets the key, it should be able to calculate all past and future privates from the same account path.
If the device is hostile to the hardware level (a public trezor kiosk perhaps), it might also attempt a power consumption attack as well.
It seems like it would be worth some effort to get a non time/path variable implementation in place asap.

If you want a small block POV, here is one:
* Segwit is not really opposed by anyone for its own merits
* Some members of the big block faction see it as a distraction to their goals
* Segwit is a fix to fundamental flaws/weaknesses in bitcoin, fixing at least two fundamental weaknesses including inbuilt malleability and lack of a safe way to soft fork scripting changes.
Increasing the blockchain scales bitcoin linearly. this has pluses and minues. Do you remember the attacks last year around october ? Bitcoin is vulnerable to SPAM and DOS attacks which weaken the network, and a larger blocksize will increase the attack surface more than it will benefit legitimate user traffic. 
Mempool management, Wallet/Merchant software hardening for 0conf txion handling and txfee control, and improved LN/sidechain support, and reduced internode bandwidth with iBLTs/WB's are all things which prepare bitcoin to scale to these levels.
All of this has been clearly explained in numerous forms, its not secret. And yet some people assume core is run by arrogant idiots. Some people assume there are vision differences in the long term goals for bitcoin. This is irrelevant, because both sides of that debate want to scale bitcoin as much as possible. 
The big block side is just run on an ignorance and oversimplified thinking. Lets scale bitcoin when its reasonable and safe to do so without compromising the integrity of the currency. All the steps are clearly outlined, and in progress. Lets not pick random, reckless, arbitrary magic numbers, and foist them upon others without undersrand the implications.

Pre-defined exodus addresses would be a security benefit i could believe in. Isolation of the signing process I could believe in. heuristic limits on withdrawal amounts, triggering operator oversight i could believe in. 
Multi-sig doesnt provide any of these automatically, nor is it needed to implement them. So it sounds like CYA to me.
@_date: 2015-01-31 19:12:58
It seems like the PIN is still simply stored inside the device, and the device knows if the pin is correct or not. I still consider this a weak PIN scheme.
I would suggest instead:
use KDF(pin) to generate an AES key, which encrypts some critical private data, such as the root node. (cfb 128 or such, so you only need the encrypt version of key sched and block cipher functions) 
When putting in a PIN, a decrypted version of the root node could be stored volatile, then the only validation of whether or not it is correct checking same pubkeyhash for key "m" as the correct original root node key.
As of course, the rate limit is good. After a certain number of retries a phycial power cycle could be necessary.
This would leave the only attacks againt the pin brute force.

That sounds like a smart setup. 
But it also matters which side does accounting; If your wallet server blindly creates and signs transactions, its only a small defense, because a take-over of your virtual servers could still empty the hot wallet.
Presumably, you keep some form of sanity checking in your wallet server; I think pre-defined exodus addresses should be a must, rather than allowing a user to supply a withdrawal address at any time. 
Some form of heuristics and trend detection makes sense as well. for example, withdrawals over a certain amount (10btc?) should require manual verification by an human operator, perhaps.
Making sure a user account is expected to have a certain amount of funds, etc, makes more sense to control on your side, imo, rather than trusting the virtual hosted services to determine.

Thanks for the responses. 
I think its a reasonable scheme to add 2FA; Both the phone and the computer would both have to be simultaneously and fully exploited by the same/cooperating malware in order to perform the attack. If both are exploited by the same malware at any time, not just setup, then the security can be bypassed.  But if only one is, then the system should be secure.
@_date: 2015-01-08 16:56:33


Just because you can "be your own bank" doesnt mean that everyone is ready to do it.
The idea is to reduce the total amount of fraud in the system. Both insured/guranteed accounts, and cash-like accounts are possible with a strong foundation in a irrevesible secure transaction system.
The current transaction systems for credit, debit, ach, are very low security and thus fraud is high. Both small time fraud like, such as credit card scanning, to big time fraud like S&amp;L scams or the housing market collapse. This is something we all pay for, and it is something worth eliminating.

Exactly! The trezor is for doing math without leaking your key. An acid-free printout, or even your human memory is a much better safe for long term storage. 
I would have said multiple encrypted online backups, but then you would still have to memorize a decryption password, in which case you might as well memorize your recovery phrase.
@_date: 2016-03-01 02:13:03
Those 12 random words will be secure from brute force attacks for a million years. Your bip38 passphrase could be attackable in 3 years with an scrypt ASIC. Never trust trapdoor complexity, unless you can change the password every couple of years as technology advances. 
Lets also not mention that you are probably going to choose the bip38 passphrase yourself, making it far easier to attack than a bip39 mnemonic, which you have to let a computer choose for you.
Furthermore, with the paper laying about, there is actually something to attack, and proof that there is something to take (ever hear of lead pipe cryptanalysis?) Depending on how you printed it out, the exact face value could be revealed as well, giving a nice neat motive to whoever sees the paper.
Forgetting even that, shit happens: A fire, a flood. Someone sees a silly bit of paper and trashes it. 
Safe deposit boxes can and regularly do get searched. Would you want to be watching the news when you learn that bitcoin paraphenalia is being confiscated from deposit boxes, then have the warden visit you for a little passphrase sharing. Easy as pie for him to add some years to that little old sentence, and seeing as you are only a month from getting out, do you really want your bitty coins that much ?

That is true; but without any form of address re-use the implications of this are very small: Ultimately the Player A has no way to be sure if the payout he receives is associated with another players deposit or not.

Also, they bought in expecting to Hodl for double, and not to have to muddle with traditional exchanges and such. 
Once enough GBTC holders break ranks then I suspect the market will normalize, closing the gap with the open market for coins one way or another. This could be years off, unless the exchange price jumps back into the 600 dollar range (either via a dollar crash or btc surge)

I agree that the technologies such as timing attack resistance, power attack resistance, and physical tamper resistance are aplus.  I do think those would be valuable features to add to any hardware wallet. I do not think they represent a credible threat or differentiator at the current time. 
I'm also not a big fan of short PIN numbers, but I really cannot think of a valid alternative for usability right now. 
I dont know if the trezor wipes its internal memory after X failed attempts or not, but if it does, then it should be par with smartcards for PIN security.
@_date: 2015-01-17 17:44:25
I dont own a trezor, but so far it seems to be the only hardware wallet with a respectable design. Im not really in the market. The author of this article does seem to be pushing smart cards, and explain how they have some mysterious benefits to overcome their obvious shortcoming.
* logical attacks: would apply equally to both, as the compleity of hte interfaces is comparable. both have signature methods, so there is really no difference.
* physical or side channels attacks: with bitcoin the devices are not designed to be plugged into strange machines usb ports this case might make sense. trezors and similar are not devices you plug in to a merchants register.
* trivial man in the middle attack: applies equally to both
* advanced man in the middle attack: seriously, this doesnt have anything to do with the customers wallet.
* “NSA attack”: the attenstation key is no more protection than the firmware signature key, and arguably less. Also, an attack based upon physical snatching of your card or devicel, which can result in the rubber hose attack just as easily. no differentiation here.
I was drawing attention to the only meaningful differentiator: the dedicated UI.

* Only one pin is correct, and all others are useless
* Pins are not useful for plausible deniability
* PIN's are not needed to setup a new trezor to match an older trezor, passphrases are
* typing the incorrect pin in should have consequences (deletion of flash at some point)
* passphrases have no consequences.
* a PIN is to defend the trezor in the physical hands of a hostile person. 
* a passphrase is to defend the trezor's owner when both he and the trezor are in hostile hands.

Multiple site checking rate limits and heuristics, and having multiple systems authorize a transaction can all be done without multi-sig. isolating the private key signature service can be done without multi-sig. Really all the most important things can be done without multi-sig.
The only thing I can really imaging multi-sig providing is physical site redundancy for the private key service: If one of the chief administrators of your site is a risk for simply rooting the box and surreptitiously stealing the private keys, having a second site requires means that both site administrators have to be compromised to leak keys.
Ultimately this means you can get rid of the single point of failure caused by having a single server somewhere that must have at least one administrator.
In order for this to matter, all of the supporting sanity-checking services must both be separately implemented, and separately administered. Also, the sanity checking services should also be separately controlled from the privkey signature services, and all should be separately audited/monitored.
@_date: 2015-01-31 19:44:07
BIP38 tends not to be as good as a trezor for cold storage, for a number of reasons
(1) BIP39 forces good passphrases with high entropy, bip38 does not
(2) Not limited to a single address, no risk of changedeath mistake
(3) You dont actually need a physical trezor for it to be cold storage
(4) A bip39 mnemonic will be easier to memorize than an unstructured phrase.

a few bytes of flash storage, that mounts read-only when plugged in, and a controller for the usb storage... doesnt seem liek that much.
I dont know how much storage the trezor has to spare though, nor whether it can as a char device and a block device simultaneously.
Some kind of built-in wallet client would go a long way towards making the device self-contained. 
OTOH, waiting until more clients support the device is probably fine.
Most USB devices take that approach. I guess OP's complain is really "My computer doesnt support TREZOR well" and not "Something is wrong with trezor".
If the device was a usb speaker or a usb mouse, he would blame his OS and not the device.

BTCchip doesnt seem to have much in the way of non bypassable 2FA.
The trezor's screen allows an un-rooted view of what is going on. but a btcchip is no more secure than your computer.


you cant be serious. Writing a tool that looks at all the well known wallets, and waits for you to unlock them or type in your PIN is damnably easy. And it only has to be solved once for huge rewards. If you are hoping noone will bother to take your coins because they are obscure, then you are not looking at the fairly elaborate schemes to rob people of their btc that have already been implemented by criminals.


why would an attackier try to guess a pin ? 
a trezor may be a dead end, but a ledger, smartcard, or btcchip is going to be unlocked by the user at some point and then its open season. (any other form of 2fa these require can be faked at this point).

the user's wallet might not be originating the funds in the first place. And confirmation are needed to ensure that the private key is retired before making ecdsa sigs. (the second signature made with a key *could* compromise the private; best bet is never make a second signature) 
B2B payments could simply use bip70 payments in both directions., including refunds. 
For normal B2C payment use cases, I cannot see a net benefit for the consumer, only loss.
B2C merchants are better off relying on their existing authentication systems for refund addresses, imo. 
That said I think your suggestions for the memo field are fairly crucial, and that should be explored.

@_date: 2016-01-25 22:13:11


Similar to bitpay, I have a daemon which accepts payments from a shopping cart. If the total amount of funds is small, the txfee is within range for an okay confirmation time, and the TX seems to be propagated through a vast majority of nodes, especially some key mining related nodes, odds are good that the window for a double spend has closed an the 0confirm has a low chance of being double-spent.
With and RBF txion, you cannot make that assessment. So you have to either refuse the payment, or else wait for 10 minutes to an hour to allow it. My current plan is simply to ignore RBF transactions with less than 1 confirmation, maybe 2.

It seems so, but the much or all of contents of a HDW fit easily into a single transaction.
A trivially conservative malware could use the btchip python for a small app that:
queries all coins in an hdw using the local wallets, sorts by value, limits to 25 largest inputs for
propagation speed, wait for the user to use their wallet and substitues the transaction
for the mal-transaction, lets the user do the song and dance PIN while intercepting
the normal output and showing the user what he expects, then broadcasts
the final signed result.
A quick review of the btchip python scripts shows that it is possible to sign an untrusted transaction
formed outside the card, and that it can contain many inputs from the wallet.


Perhaps, but we are still talking about day-project for high school students.


Certainly your own custom software presents a smaller target. Few attacks are targetted to a single user. We can hardly suggest that each user create their own custom scripting, so the majority will be using off the shelf tools.

Your risk analysis assumes that noone knows how to ask around about bitcoin, noone is willing to help others to crack wallets, that noone knows that he has any, and that noone will recognize it if they saw it. That there will be no disasters, or accidents that degrade his printout. ( As is a printed bip38 wallet could not be googled to trivially figure out what it is. Very naive imo.)
Most importantly, he is far more likely to forget his self-chosen bip38 passphrase than a machine generated bip39 one. You dont understand how the human mind works, which is not unreasonable given the entire computing industry has labored under this fallacy for 30+ years.
Relevant XKCD;  
In short: bip38 style passphrases are easy for computers to crack, hard for people to memorize. Bip39 style passphrases, among all the other benefits, are easy for people to memorize and hard for computers to crack.

correct. Its so they do not need to contact them, not so that they can prove the same customer owns the refund address


Its equally useful to other side channels for refunds, such as the users preferences, etc. This allows it to be automatically added by the wallet software. 
You see it as a bug, I see it as a feature; protecting the user's anonymity when it comes to the blockchain is a net plus.


Do you want a payment protocol in which the user must prove ownership of the refund addresses?
I would see that as worse.
The payment protocol is not an AML tool. It also cannot prove the source of the funds, what about the use case where someone else if both paying and setup to receive the refund: payment protocol works for that. 
Think about the use case its a cryptographic proof, a receipt, for the sale of a given item in exchange for some BTC.
If the merchant requires a receipt for a refund, then they should run the payment protocol in the reverse direction, instead of using the refund address. As it stands, refunds are done at the grace of the merchant if they are done at all.

bip39 is safer, leaves less traces, is (on average) far higher entropy/security and easier to memorize, private, and can be directly and safely used in a wallet without opsec violations encouraged by single key use.

The nodes run by the makers of breadwallet, mycelium, electrum, bitpay insight, and various other wallet makers are equally important. Users dont ask miners what their balance is, they ask wallets. And If a miner cannot get their coinbase out into user's wallets, they noone will pay them for mining.
Blockchain.info is an extremely important node, disproportionately so.
People check it and assume it represents truth. No hard fork could be won without it.
If blockchain.info collaborated with the major exchanges and a a siple majority of wallet node providers, then I would say miners would be near powerless to defy them.
Gladly, these key node operators have defact declared against a foolish blocksize increase, with teh exception of coinbase. I wont switch my nodes to a larger block size until segwit is majority at least, and I will likely hold out for maturation of fee-setting technology in major wallets as well as better mempool management in nodes first. 
If we rush to increase the blocksize without those key enhancements, we are gifting the blockchain to spammers.

How is that a good thing? 
A person who has a guaranteed job can fish boogers from his bunghole for $10 per hour. How valuable is that exactly?
The simple fact is that labor is one of the most variable-value services possible to imagine.
It has no fixed value, nor can it grant a fixed value to anything else.


Right, it buys nearly-valueless labor with money it doesnt have, then removes all motivation from it.
What part of that sounds like good economics?
Perhaps, in order to "improve" this system, you will allow the overseer's to apply strong disincentives to slackers.  Wow, we have already arrived at gulag forced labor camps, that fast!
Please, reconsider this approach.
The only real effects of the minimum wage are to deny jobs to people who cannot earn more, and to deny survival to smaller businesses such that they will be replaced by distended behemoths like walmarts, or amazons.

FYI bip38 paper wallets are not the safest way to store your BTC.
The password is human chosen, and all human chosen phrases are crackable.
It can also only handle one address/key combo, and it can be very dangerous to spend safely later on.
The modern way to do this is to generate a standard mnemonic phrase with mycellium, trezor, breadwallet etc, and to memorize it as your password. 
That way you can safely manage multiple private keys and large amounts of BTC without even needed a printed piece of paper.

this is a valid technique assuming users operate fullnode wallets, or SPV wallets.
Users of centralized wallets such as electrum or mycelium can be targetted simply by subpoenaing the electrum server operator or mycelium server operator via the local govt. 
Users of Cellphone wallets can be directly targeted via the phone carrier; since the protocol messages generally travel in the clear, you can directly intercept transaction broadcasts.
There are proposals for improving this, such as onion like tx notifications, which do not yet have wide support.
Anonymizing tx rebroadcasters defeat this technique, mainly by connecting over tor, choosing a unique node for each broadcast, then disconnecting and never using it again. such as

Someone did that recently; Picked some crazy UTF-8 symbols that most people couldnt even type in with their keyboards and released a bip38 code with some small funds in it.
It really proves nothing though; the average person is going to pick a password they can remember, and its going to be weak; maybe even weaker because of the false sense of security given by bip38. As soon as I add an FPGA or asic scrypt calculator, standard pw dictionaries and patterns should allow most bip38 passphrases to be cracked easily.

Dealing with RBF is going to suck; this massively increases the difficulty of assessing mempool risk; After gauging fee's it used to be possible to say with an acceptable risk that a given zeroconf txion would almost certainly confirm. With RBF, you have to scan the full transaction parent history going up to 2confirms to be sure. Really pointless feature, CPFP would have been a far better way to accomplish this.

Why protect a strong password with a weaker password? 
Generate a 12 word seed and simply memorize it. Any password picked by a human will be far weaker than one chosen by a computer. 
(trezor only defaults to 24 because it has a poor recovery algorithm, and assumes your computer is hostile)
If you are worried about your memory, instead of writing down your password, write down something to help spur your memory, like a poem or picture, and practice using your password once in a while. 
If you have no faith in your memory at all, a weak password is better than nothing. but the investment to memory a 12 word bip39 password is pretty small.

Some of the suggestions are quite good; specifically I think the memo field should not only be mandatory, but structured for rigorous validation. (Especially if a strong nonce of the original request is included along with all the request details, user id, etc.)
But requiring a private key signature to prove ownership of the refund address has a number of downsides, not the least of which that the customer must have the private key in the first place. A sophisticated wallet may not even keep the private keys available when the user is not spending, meaning it would be a downside on a number of levels.
Its never ideal for a private key which will ever hold bitcoin to also be used for other types of activity such as signing messages (especially doing so while its not already retired for monetary purposes)
Assuming the memo field is used strongly, the client at least can be assured there is no middleman.

Well, the most likely one is: bitcoin itself. 
Deflationary economies work on different principles that we are used to. We are conditioned to seek some form of investment vehicle, at a minimum to combat inflation, or with more risk, to yield a return. 
With bitcoin the lowest risk investment is bitcoin itself. You are betting that the (bitcoin) economy itself will grow, and by not spending your bitcoin, you make all other bitcoin more valuable, thus providing the rest of the economy in general with more spending power with which to invest. should they increase productivity of society, your bitcoin deflate, and thus you are paid back.
As for contributing capital to a larger, higher risk enterprise, there isnt yet a good way to do that. 
If you could start a business with only bitcoin funding, and list shares on a stock exchange with shares traded in BTC, then this would be possible. As far as I know, there are no such exchanges yet, and no significant jurisdictions where they would be legal. 
Once bitcoin can be used full-loop at a cottage level, we can speculate about possible futures for larger capital markets. We are still many orders of magnitude away from that level.

Most people accept a given price mainly because other people are. There is a bit of herd mentality to the market stasis point. Most offers to buy/sell will vary around a given average price.
However, there is usually some movement;
* Some people may simply buy less than they used to for many reasons
* Someone who sold regularly may stop 
* Someone who never participated before joins the market to either sell or buy
* The value of a separate asset (such as dollars) may change
* Changing relative exchange rate may cause panic/speculatory behavior
The net effect is that there is always some pressure on the market to move in some direction, and thus it tends to stabilize around what people are really willing to exchange.

If you are relaying double spends, then miners are more likely to see them, then more likely to give them mining preference. The whole point of timestamp servers (miners, to a lesser extent all fullnodes) is to enforce the first come first serve nature of transactions.

some of the "stress test" transactions are possible to clean up, because they are sent to addresses that anyone can spend from. They are dust, and not really worth collecting, but possible to clean up.
Some are sent to normal addresses and cannot be cleaned up except by the original sender. 
The price to permanently store a piece of data on thousands of computers around the world right now is very low. And its not just the blockchain, but the UTXO, which all nodes must track, including lightweight SVP nodes.
The cost/price for making this dust is very low, some would say too low. This attack may be for the purpose of proving that fact, and lobbying the bitcoin community to push for stricter rules about dust creation.

@_date: 2015-07-23 13:17:18


Not at all; please reread the white paper and think it through.


Blocks get rolled back all the time, just from the usual communications and synchronization delays. Nothing is real unless the network agrees to fight to keep it real. 6 confirmation would mean nothing if all/many miners would be willing to roll back 10 blocks for a fee bump.


Which is true, but all good participants in the network should be working to make it real, and to stop double spends. Efforts to enforce the forward irreversible order of time is the consensus activity which give the network value. 
Anyone who relays double spends, or actively works to unravel blocks is a bad actor, and weakens the network.

I think it should have been obvious that no limit is needed; But limiting size is not the purpose of the limit at all.
The point of the "limit" is to have a shared understanding across the network such that you can create a block which everyone can accept without forking the network.
Nodes run on machines with varying amounts of space, cpu, and disk, and limiting the size and complexity of individual messages by convention is in fact an excellent way to scale a p2p network. To support unbound blocksize the protocol would have to change: it would not make sense to request or receive whole blocks but instead to request paths along the merkle tree
The process under debate now is all about the p2p protocol, and keeping consensus among all node, much more so that the blocksize, imo.
@_date: 2015-07-07 23:08:56
Fullnodes still keep all transactions forever. I think that is particularly wasteful, especially if you arent interested in historical analysis.
At some point, when the world history of all transaction gets to be onerously large,
I think there might well be a point where even full nodes "regenesis" to a more
recent point. Rather than simply a starting block, it may be a starting block, 
and a UTXO
@_date: 2015-07-05 21:21:10
Im not for or against gavin's proposal. I think it is good that we are having the debate- perhaps in the future mining nodes can directly vote amongst themselves, and possibly consider the wishes of fullnodes.
All I was saying is that a completely uncapped size for blocks would need a radically different P2P protocol, the current one would not work. Theoritically, a merkle tree walker that traded fractions of a block would safely allow such a situation, and potentially eliminate the debate forever.
now, since you are changing topics: Proof of stake can never work IMO. I think it has been thoroghly debunked online.

Changing the block limit is not a solution; The block size increase should be correlated with average fullnode/miner bandwidth, ram and storage abilities compared to transaction volume.
the mempool will always be contentious. the high reward low fee no fee regime was a very temporary state indicating that nearly noone is using bitcoin. 
If you put a reasonable fee on you transaction, it will be too expensive to crowd out with an attack. The "attack" itself was only evidence that fee's were too low, dust rules were too weak, and nothing more. 
The only take aways from this flood I see are:  wallet software with fixed lowball fee's needs to shake out; Rules regarding dust relay need to be tightened. 
I still see several months if not a year before there is a good case for block limit increases. I'll move my fullnode up probably near or shortly after the halvening time.
If you disagree, you should upgrade your fullnode to support larger blocks. This is a concensus network after all.  The reddit and mailing list arguments are pretty meaningless, the population of node has voted.

The victims wallet could simply see that the domain serving the payment request and the domain indicated by the payment request do not match, and simply decline to show it to the user.
Likewise, fields in the memo would be wrong or  missing, and make it generally invalid. (if it was structured) For example, if it indicated the refund address, then the wallet would insist that it is the expected one before showing the request to the user.

Thank you for the reply, I would very much like your answer on this topic:
If you agree private key reuse is not a negative, then are you resigned as to the implicit resistance to theoretical quatum cryptanalysis, as well as the risks of degradation on RNG which have leaked private keys in the past ? 
(IMO, explicit re-use of a private key is a noteworthy strike against any given proposal.)
RBF has no downside for the sender (other than possible rejection by the receiver) so there is nothing to discourage its use, whereas CPFP has unavoidable extra costs and would only be used in extremis of unanticipated floods of the mempool combined with a critical transaction needing confirmation. 
CPFP can also be done by the receiver of funds, while RBF is limited to the sender side. So even with RBF, there is still a motive to support Cpfp.
Philosophically; the whole purpose of a timestamp server is to record events in-order. Full RBF seems to very much go against that, moreso than the other RBF options did.
Why do you feel that the mempool should operate under such a different philosophy than the blockchain iteself ? it seems contradictory to me.
(such that i must plan to simply ignore non-final transactions in the wallet services I develop, most of which have a 15 minute window to finalize or kill a transaction and so will never close a transaction marked non-final unless a block is found quickly which includes it)

Nothing much of value comes from the "research" except possible the suggestion that payment protocol clients should obviously not present the user with a payment request that seems to come from a different site that the one the customer is on.
Secondly the memo field should be well structured, indicating what is being bought ad where it is being shipped to. It was a mistake to leave the memo field both unstructured and unspecified, because then the user's agent has no reliable method to present the memo to the user a structured manifest of what is being bought, where it will be shipped to, terms of refund or cancellation, exodus/refund addresses upon overpayment etc. Perhaps even more importantly, and invoice ID. A structured receipt would be far more useful, imo.
The suggestion in the paper to countersign refund addresses is negative. The user might not be able to do that, since they may be send via a third party. They may also not own the refund address. 
However, if the refund address was included in the original order request, then it could be in a structured memo field, and thus give the user a chance to agree to it before paying.
So yes the payment protocol could be improved, but none of the weaknesses described in the paper are real weaknesses.

I would like to limit the per peer performance fairly. Edge information such as new TX's and new block should move quickly, but I want to BPS limit older blocks, especially oldest blocks more than 100K ago I might simply prefer not to serve at all.
I would like a hard cap on memory footprint, in MB, in which core should handle all its business without crashing, by automatically tuning its mempool settings to bth keep the higest value txions in memory while filtering dust and noise.

Democracies are easily manipulated, because people can vote on any issues, even one's which they are not affected by or have no standing in, so they often vote without having to truly care about the results or understand the issues.

In democracy casting a vote costs nothing, and can be done without diminishing one's stock or risking one's assets.

Not all are affected the same.

Cars are easy to borrow for, because the car serves as collateral. Not so much in its resale value, as in the loss of its utility being a significant decision making factor in the borrowers' mind. You will see a change in car design in a hard money regime; and emphasis on durability and maintainability and less on frills and performance i expect. but prices wont move much. 
Employee cost will change; mostly by becoming vastly more expensive in real terms. (the real value of wages increases)

You are missing the point; 
If the current demand for bitcoin were constant, then the USD exchange price should be falling fairly steadily, as supply is increasing at ~10% inflation, which is higher than the expected USD inflation rate of late.
This means that there is some net rising demand for BTC in exchange for USD, which can account for the bitcoin inflation.
There must be some way to measure that demand, and the simplest is in units of either BTC or USD. In this case, saying that there is about 1million USD equivalent net daily excess demand for BTC would accurate describe why the price appears stable despite inflation of supply.
Whether that is due to an influx of new buyers, or a drop in relative available sellers, or a change in behavior associated with a given exchange rate, or by the dollar inflating at 10%, etc, it can still be measured.

It goes against some core philosophies:
* A private key should only ever be used once, for one single signature
* First-seen is the fundamental role of mining: it indicates intention and thus should be as permanent as possible. 
* Nothing stops a miner from RBFing confirmed transactions, if the incentive exceeds the block reward. In fact it paves the way for this to be more normal
Why is it inferior for accelerating confirmation ?
* RBF can only be done by the sender. CPFP can be done by either the receiver or sender
* RBF allows "take backs" of sent funds, CPFP does not allow sneaky behavior
* RBF requires new wallet behavior, and a very difficult to explain payment status "paid for, but fully reversible" 
* CPFP requires no new wallet logic, no new payment statuses.

Will it do anything to mitigate the "attack": no.
It would help you out, if you have a need for regular trustworthy knowledge for transaction state, without having to trust any 3rd parties.
If you have enough network bandwidth, it may help the bitcoin network out, by relaying transactions and blocks around more quickly, and keeping the p2p network more stable. 
It will give you a vote in any protocol changes.
If you have any reasonable mining capacity, you will add some measure of security to the network. (this is tricky, and not the same as pool mining)

So few people know how to use bitcoin privately, and its far far from easy or cheap to do so.

I think that is a great idea. There are other onramps to use, and those ones have not yet clamped down as coinbase has. 
Let us move our business to those so they can grow and coinbase wither. At least until they repeat coinbase's mistakes, then we will changes on-ramps again.
If we keep changing horses once they become corrupted, then it will be a freer and better bitcoin economy, with many small onramps, which prioritize freedom or else risk being shunned as well.

There is a reason the TLS does key establishment and secret creation at the same time: One or the other alone is not enough.
If you really think it is okay to trust any signed message, without any assurance it is even intended for you, and no protection from observation, then you are begging for attacks such as the refund attack mentioned in the paper.

There are reasons to deny double spends, the same as the reasons to deny them today: they are double spends. 


How would you see the ideal result of the MAD bidding war which could results from RBF competing with CPFP ?
I always thought that was the least savory aspect of RBF.
A semi-hostile but greedy server hosted wallet would always try to outbid any RBF replacements of incoming funds, down to 0 in a tit-for-tat strategy.


The very rollout of RBF implies that most nodes will choose to apply the default settings, and that only fringe nodes will act otherwise. (otherwise RBF would likely not function reliably until a significant fraction had upgraded)
Some commonality to mempool behavior is just as important to the rest of consensus logic.
This is a fairly important change to the mempool behavior, and I woudnt dismiss it as "non enforceable anyway".

CPFP allows both and either the spender and receiver to increase fees, while not allowing any take-backs.


Bumping fee's indicates a significant miscalculation by the sender or underestimation of priority for the receiver. There is no reason it should be a cheap or normal process.
RBF allows needless and wasteful load to the network at a low price.


These two feature conflict, and this allows for a spender vs receiver bidding war.
Not good; Its better to have only one. That why I will work to make RBF unreliable.

For a product to be self-owning, it would have to be able to keep its private keys a secret from the world. This means that any kind of virtual or cloud hosting is out of the question, because then the "products" are little more than crops. So having a physical body is necessary to be truly self owning.
Since a physical body is necessary, it has to protect that body. 
The simplest way is to belong to someone else and count on them to provide protection. (symbiont)
Alternatively, it could try to hide and camouflage itself. 
The last technique would be to have some form of self defense capability (scary)

You are correct despite the downvotes: *True* naked shorting into an open market cannot happen, but thats not how its is done.
the shorter enters a position, selling bitcoins that dont exist, and getting USD that also does not exist and cannot be withdrawn. As the exchange ratio drifts the gambler is theoretically up or down. If btc goes up enough to get near the margin reserve, their position is instantly liquidated, and the fake btc destroyed by buying them back from whichever seller and whichever price. (a well managed exchange could do this instantly so they dont run a risk of a bank run)
Another shorting strategy would be to match short and long positions. Each btc shorter is matched with a fiat shorter, and neither can withdraw till closing.
Imagine its like a poker table, and neither player can leave until the hand is done. The exchange (and lenders) take the rake, and both players walk away with their winnings or losses. This is much safer, since no fake fiat or fake btc is actually required, even temporarily.

Yes, please read the RFC, it is about K values specifically.
You may not have heard but RSA had similar problems with bad implementations of padding and prime finding. Low entropy on pair generation has caused similar breaks, and and if anything RSA relies much more highly on probabilistic algorithms driven by a DRBG than does ECC.
My original point was that ECC will displace RSA due to its numerous other benefits, performance and security advantages. As a bitcoiner I would have expected you to be aware of those. The only advantage RSA might have today is that existing implementations of gpg etc have long had stable RSA support, whereas only the newest/latest have decent ECDSA/ECIES support. 
Rather than the bitcoin curve it may turn out that ed25519 becomes the norm for email, but the bitcoin network is a stellar demonstration of millions of people singing messages using secp256k1 without losing their private keys.

This attack relies upon incoming connections to ban exit nodes, and thus only affects onion-aware bitcoin nodes which are running as a hidden service. If you plan to run bitcoind as a hidden service, dont use exit nodes or connect to non-hidden service peers.

I hope you recognize the difference between demonstrating the feasibility of electric transportation reaching highway speeds in a relatively low tech way, vs land bound airplanes moving a speeds greater than human perception allows.

Changes to vehicular transportation are absolutely incremental, and entriely within the bounds of easy prediction. Considering the typical outlines of a futurist, cars have almost hilariously unchanging, and futurists over the last 100 years have universally overshot their guesses around transportation.

This is all much easier for a small business, because a single person can simply hold the wallet. For a larger business it can be more complicated, because of varying degrees of authority. Most likely some form of escrow bank would be needed, and separate funding for daily spending vs long term savings.
(1) 3rd party or internal escrow bank. A daily spend pool held 2/3 by a chief financial officer + technician, and a reserve savings fund held 4/7 by the board of directors + chief of IT. This could all be facilitated by a 3rd party escrow company for those businesses without significant internal IT.
(2) The same way payroll is done now, if using fiat, or using one of the various bitcoin payroll services.
(3) Invoices today are relatively insecure; This would need to be signed invoices of some type, such as BIP70 or gpg encrypted communications. Of all your criticisms, this one is the biggest, because it requires both sides of a given relationship to adopt higher security simultaneously. This will be challenging even if good products and companies are out there.
(4) Something like coinkite: pegging the value of some bitcoins to an arbitrary currency or commodity. This is simpler than holding a tranditional bank balance, and may represent the future of banking.

The payment protocol in bip70 is pretty ideal, imo. You might find
it tough to work with, as there is not much common software to use
it yet. 
alternatively, you could set up a simple email with GPG.
Verify the fingerprint of each other's keys using a phone call,
then type up a plain old fashioned document with any tool you
like, include your bitcoin payment address, and buyer/seller informatin
shipping addresses etc, and sign it with gpg. If they pay, then the
transaction ID matching the amount should be proof enough. Make sure
the adress is fresh, has never been used for anything else, and dont reuse it.
gpg is easy enough that any regular computer literate person could use it.
and honestly, you have to be at least a little computer literate to use bitcoin anyway.

Perhaps instead of saying "value" the author should have used "exchange rate". The two are not the same.
If bitcoin value increases by 2x, and the dollar by 4x, then both increase in value. But the BTC/USD exchange rate would fall by 50%.

The linked document shows a few security errors that are correctable, even if forensics never shows how Zach's laptop was attacked.
This looks like less than a full compromise of the hotwallet, so some basic security measures could have helped to prevent this.
Error 1 - unsecured non-dedicated admin access
Administrative terminals with the power to direct coin are themselves secure assets. What good is hiding your server in a tier 3 datacenter if you can ssh in to it from an unsecured laptop which isnt even dedicated.
Remediation: Admin capable machines should be dedicated single purpose machines. Admin machines should be kept in a secure facility. Admin machines should only be accessible from within the secure facility. Operators of admin machines should not get root on those machines. SSH parameters should be extremely tight, with non-standard ports and limited negotiable params.
Error 2
The service was willing to send to a newly defined address. Exodus from a wallet's space should require previously defined exodus destinations, and verifiable transaction id records. The ability for a hot-wallet to send to arbitrary destinations allows digital theft of the coins with no traceability. Pre-defined withdrawal destinations addresses means that it is always clear which user withdrew which amount, which user authorized the withdrawal, and which service or operator approved the transaction. For a value such as 150 btc,
a human operator should be involved in approval, imo.
Error 3 -- service conflation
The hot wallet service should be fully dedicated, and run no other software purposes other than "automated exodus withdrawal processing". I.E it should not be directly involved in user deposits, or inter-user transfers, etc.. (it can discover the deposits via the blockchain) It should be sent heuristic information periodically, such as balances, caps, limits etc.

Its not too hard to generate a 12 word bip39 mnemonic if you know how diceware works, and you have access to 8 sided and four sided dice.
I can write it up if you want. (basically generate each word with one foursider and 3 eightsiders "d4 d8 d8 d8" )
The hardest part is picking the last bip39 word; you may have to try up to 16 words to get the checksum to pass. (start at the word "d4 d8 (2*d4) 1" and try the next 15 words in order till the checksum works out in a wallet restore test)

In a few coin generations, all exiting coins will share the same taint.

Its a big part yes; bitcoin isnt juju magic alien tech; its stuff normal done by normal people for normal reasons.
the core part of it is Motivation: the users, the developers, the speculators, the algorithm, the miners, the various value-add services, the merchants, the network protocol, the network. 
All of these things are tied together via a system of trustless consensus. Miner's are motivated to compete but not to get caught taking too large a share. Speculators are motivated to hold their bits, users to spend them. Merchants are motivated to accept them for goods and services. 3rd party companies are incentivized to facilitate the above. The developers are motivated to be prudent, and work carefully, and maintain to code. Many of the above are motivated to operate fullnodes. 
So long as there is no major breakdown in the algorithm or the network, all participants will have the right motivation to defend their part of it. 
It goes beyond the mere technical (which is brilliant) 
The magic of bitcoin is the economics; the way it has structured incentives for individual actions.

Can you revise the article? 


@_date: 2015-10-04 14:17:57


You are suggesting an auxiliary signature, made by at least one of the input holders, to prove that the tx should be relayed. (perhaps not included in the block, but used on the p2p network only)
such a scheme would only work for single party transactions, and only for cases in which the inputs have clearly associated public keys. (an input is a scriptPubkey, so presumably this is another scriptsig with different rules.)
For p2sh, multisig or other complex types of scripts, this could be rather fancy. 
Personally, I think bip62 is already more than enough.
I suspect another reason why there is no rush to address this is that for some transaction types it can never be prevented, so leaving this is pushes wallet developers to build smarter wallets today.

I'm not sure why you think hoarding bitcoin is a negative economic activity ? Speculation can be a waste, but it can also help facilitate change.
And how is it rent seeking ? Rent-seeking is when you seek to use force to cause compliance. Bitcoin hoarders cannot force anyone to buy bitcoin from them, its certainly not rent seeking.
And if it wasnt for hoarders, bitcoin would be likely dead in the cradle.

and both banks agreed to hold a reserve in BTC, then they could
offer ~1hr international money transfers, fully confirmed and withdrawable.
24/7/365 and time day or night.
Might be one hell of a competitive advantage over other conventional banks.
Ignoring the advantages in fees/pricing, the speed of the transfer would be
impossible to achieve in conventional banking. 
I have accounts at two banks
that are next-door neighbors, and the fastest way for me to transfer money between

That could never happen, as the signature would then have to sign itself.
The attack is based on the fact that ecdsa signatures can be modified without making them invalid, not by changing the transaction details. (A signature is two integers: (R,S), and (R,-S) also works)
BIP62 is supposed to fix this, but it does not seem to have been urgently rolled out; mainly due to the fact that it would break compatibility and didnt seem urgent.

Yours is the best explanation in this whole thread so far. I think point 1 is by far the biggest: people do not understand money. I know people in banking and finance who do not understand money, much less average people. 
If people truly understood how money works, they would be seeking out things like bitcoin much more actively, because its scary. 
When I introduce people to bitcoin, I often start with this "Besides the clothes on your back, bitcoin is the only thing you can truly own."

Which is fine, but horribly overdue. None of the technology for distributed ledgers was missing in 1995. 
Permission chains also fail to counter one of the main tenets of bitcoin: the fact that you dont need permission to hold money or trade: when you hold bitcoin you actually hold it, rather than having someone else hold it in your name. 
Of course, this will be hard to address, since it takes away the primary raison detre for banks in the first place.

You have an interesting definition to the word "anarchy". 
To me its neither insane nor chaotic, simply decentralized. 
Look at p2p networks: people are sharing the same few popular favorites of movies and music with even smaller variety then the regulated markets. If anything, its more organized because there are fewer rules introducing complexity.
With anarchy of currency, there would probably be a lot fewer, and a lot better organized global monetary systems.

Well, there is an obvious difference in economic purchasing power for roughly equivalent work round the world. National borders, financial system boundaries, language barriers, and cultural barriers contribute to this distortion.
Eliminating national and financial boundaries should cause migration of wealthy retired or nonworking people to low cost of living areas to maximize the value of their savings. It should also cause poor working people to migrate to high paying areas to maximize the value of the earnings.  If this could happen globally, then you would see a very rapid disintegration of the difference between (1st,2nd,3rd) "worlds", and a very rapid normalization of costs and earnings in most places. 
the remaining barriers would still be language, climate, and culture. Few people enjoy not being able to communicate well with neighbors. Few people will choose to live on antarctica. few people like strange cultures other than what they are used to.

Its not necessarily your fault. Securing a windows machine is really hard, and its not something you should expect the average person to be able to do. The best thing to do is not use windows for valuable data like bitcoin. 
If you switch to a cellphone wallet, assuming you dont install lots of sketchy apps, it will probably be more secure. Breadwallet or mycelium are two popular choices.
A linux netbook with electrum on it will work quite well. (or you can reboot your windows PC using a USB key with Tails installed on it, which includes electrum.)
If you must use windows, you can consider a hardware helper, such as TREZOR, which helps you to avoid putting secure information into an insecure operating system.

Hoarding is the only thing that gives bitcoin any value; the higher the value of bitcoin, the more easily large amounts of value can be moved. Moving enough BTC to purchase a cruise-liner with BTC today would be near impossible. You could probably move enough to buy a house without drastically impacting the market, but even that would create a noticeable bump in daily traffic.
If you got your way and bitcoin was pennies in price, then it would not nearly be as useful. By having people buy and hold bitcoin, they make the network more useful for me. I want as many hoarders as possible, now.


And they are also taking a risk of losing 100% of their investment. This is the nature of speculation. If you think they have it so good and the risk is crazy low, then why arent you buying BTC like mad instead of whining about it ??


nonsense; hoarding has nothing to do with malleability. And their hesitation to make changes has everything to do with the network effect and prudence, and I'm glad they are being prudent. I think the ravening XT zombies, and reddit hivethink threads are rightfully being ignored. Those who can make things better do so; those who cannot apparently post angsty threads in social media. 


I disagree emphatically; I think the stability and resistance to attack shown by the code is just about right for its current value. Fast iteration leads to dumb mistakes, and we are thankfully past that point. Honestly, the strength of the design is pretty amazing, and the core devs seem to be putting effort in the right places (mempool scaling) and ignoring the fahsionable disasters often bemoaned on reddit.
And who are you to say what people can spend their money on anyway ? If people are making a mistake by hoarding, then that is their risk to take. But its not your call to make, its theirs. You can decide to what to do with your own money. 
Personally, I think the level of hoarding is still tragically low, and I would like to see a thousand fold increase in hodlers asap; that will make bitcoin more useful to me even if im not holding a single satoshi.

As soon as I saw you were running two copies of electrum I knew what was going to happen. Electrum is not designed to run more than one copy at a time, but it doesnt really do anything to prevent you from running two or prevent them from writing over each other's work.
You were not hacked, so most likely you can recover your data with a disk recovery tool. Never skip the step of writing down your seed phrase, its not optional.
Also, you are running electrum on windows: this is a very bad idea. You were not hacked this time, so you might be able to recover. Next time, you will be hacked, because windows is not a safe place to hold bitcoin.

Electrum server is very heavyweight, and not particularly optimized. 
I suspect that many electrum servers will fall over after a blocksize increase, due to the increase memory and CPU loading.

Its because there arent any other variables. unlike a company stock, there are no earning to report, or changing expenses.
Unlike oil, the supply is fixed and very predictable.
bitcoins stability vs any other currency will largely be a function of its market cap; the larger the market cap is, the more people are buying/selling/using bitcoin, and thus the less sensitive it will be to microtrends.


Oil and single companies stocks are also not applicable to the trinity concept, only governments. 


I dont see how it would diminish the currency however, that depends on how btc performs. If btc started to climb, the fiat goverenment would need to deplete foreign reserves to match.
However, the country could alternatively use monetary policy to match btc, by adjusting interest rates to keep the value pegged.

That is the correct answer. A coin is an output of a transaction, and its value can come from any/all of the inputs, but there is nothing to say which, no number or identity at all. The value of a coin is ust a number, a simple amout. it has no identity or tracking number.
back to the water analogy:
A "coin" is like a uniquely numbered glass. Its value is the amout of water inside it. A transaction is like a bucket. When you pour some cups into a bucket, the cups are typically discarded, and new cups are created to receive water back out from the bucket. (any leaking drops fall to the floor to be absorbed by the miners)
Lets say anonimity is like clean water, and tracking "taint" is like dirty, germ filled water.
By reusing a cup that was used before, it become dirty. Think of it as germs on the cup, that make it's water "dirty". Its best to never re-use a cup. 
Sometimes when receiving water normally, you receive dirty water. This isnt your fault. Its because some other people have bad habits, and re-use their cups, or put their cups in dirty places.
If your water is dirty, you can mix it in a bucket with other peoples cleaner water, to dilute your water and make it less dirty. If your water is mixed enough, it become safe to drink again. because the germs are meainingless when they are spread out too much, they arent strong enough to make you sick.

BIP39 does have an ugliness, I agree with your critisicms of it. They tried and failed to be wordlist independent. And you cannot validate the checksum without knowing the wordlist. 
That said, I dont see how electrums 13 word scheme is any better. It has many quirks. I'd say its far quirkier than bip39: "roof unfair dust" is a perfectly valid electrum "13 word" new style passphrase. And the wallet requires knowledge of two worldlists (old and new) to properly validate mnemonics, so its not superior in that aspect.
But BIP39 with all its warts effectively has become a standard, and more and more wallets are normalizing to it.  For those of us who like interoperability, its nice having the flexibility of using your mnemonics in different places.


The thought is growing on me. I would prefer if electrum went bip39 compatible on their own though.

you link seems to rely upon address reuse. All the detected wallets have reused addrs. Can you please provide an example of a detected wallet on that site that never reuses addresses?

not a good system, imo. 
I'd suggest and hdw wallet scheme such as bip39 for several reasons
* structured passphrase to make sure you dont mess up a byte
* computer chosen passphrase
* multiple private keys from one passphrase so you dont have to memorize so many of them.

What about import ?
Being able to import an Xpub into the address book means you could create a series of payments to an individual using an unique address for each transaction.

Surely various bitcoin related money exchange string have happened in florida, not just this one article. They all have this in common; a person willing to trade with someone loudly professing to be a criminal, and furthermore disclosing their crimes to the exchanger.
Not to mention the targets of these stings seem to be randoms with no criminal record. 
It doesnt add up.

Glad to hear you are running a linux; that will address the most common security problems and you are likely to be fine!
The bitcoinqt wallet is not the best, it will re-use addresses quite often. Unless you are transacting quite frequently, this wont bother you.
My overall recommendation is any BIP44 compatible wallet. for cold storage, the big advantage is that you can memorize your recovery phrase, so even if you lose the paper backup you dont have to lose your coins.

Those checks are weak and dont prove very much other than cooperation. They cannot prove whether the node is actually performing valiidation as a full node should.
Perhaps a check that the node refuses dust, invalid txions or block etc would be more telling. 
perhaps occasionally sending an unsolicited badly formed TX would do, and if a reject message doesnt come back , then flagging the node as useless. Sending a TX as a UTXO that is might be already spent perhaps, and expecitng a REJECT_OBSOLETE response only if it is in fact obsolete.
the downside of this approach is that you would have to send invalid data at some frequency to detect nodes which are not validating data.

Its better with BTC because only those who are involved will feel the effects.
With a BTC hack, if you are not party to it, (not the bank, consumer, or thief) then you stand to gain and lose nothing.
With a fiat hack, either the consumer, bank, or government must bail out the loss. 
The thief generally comes out ahead. Pretty much everyone else comes out behind.  
You might consider this a benefit of fiat: since all of society gets to shoulder the burden of paying the thief, the net loss to each person is relatively small. (unless the amount lost is so huge, its palpable across society, like in 2009)
BTW 190 Billion USD per annum is "hacked" via credit card fraud, and if you trade in fiat or hold fiat then you are paying a share of that theft everyday. (its reflected in the cost of what you buy, and the value of your income). And this is just routine fiat theft, not counting the bigger scams we pay for.
Personally, I'll take the responsibility of managing my own private keys, instead of helping to pay for each and every fraud in the world.  To me, thats what makes btc better, it gives me options.

Bitcoin lacks a central bank, so  there isnt really an entity with a trinity dilemma.
* Free Capital Flow 
There is no entity which can prevent someone from buying or selling things in bitcoin. There are no national borders which could block the flow of bitcoin. There is no committee which meets to decide where bitcoins can be spent. This aspect of the trinity is irrelevant.
* Fixed Exchange Rate
Anyone could attempt to fix the exchange rate of bitcoin vs a given fiat currency, so this is possible. Most likely, this would be a fiat state attempting to peg their currency to BTC, but buying and selling their reserves vs btc. Considering the size of the btc market cap today, and the size of a typical national reserve, this is very feasible. 
* Independent Monetary Policy
Bitcoins monetary policy is hardcoded into the software. There is a fixed rate of inflation that tapers off, until it stops completely around 2040. 
There is no ability  to change or adapty, so there is no independence to the policy, therefore this aspect of the trinity is impossible.
All things considered, there is no relation between the trinity and the bitcoin exchange rate. It is a tiny market, so it is volatile. Once the bitcoin market grows, it will naturally be stable.

it is hard to wrap one's mind around it, yes. Mining seems like pointless math being run for no reason. All that effort running just to prove who owns what and when...
It seems less strange when you realize that it likely uses less energy than conventional fiat banking. those fiat banks and stock markets have no shortage of energy use, its just simpler to understand. 
Its hard to conceive of how arbitrary computers owned by anyone doing notably "useless" work can replace the function of specific computers owned by the finace sector doing understandably "useful" work, and do so more efficiently.

bbs's and reddit type sites are neatly replacing the news as the place people go to first to learn what is going on in the world. It is decentralized because they only stay on top so long as they are best. 
At some point, the vestiges of reporting/newgathering companies will likely go under or become decentralized completely, segueing into the facebook topic: people are more than willing to share their experiences online for free. 


My point was that facebook can dissapear overnight, just like myspace did.
I dont care about one specific competitor, not one whit, because that is not the point at all. The point is that a competitor *can* appear. 


The market action is sharing information, nothing more. Legalities eventually yield to realities. 
Content creation post facto is a sunk cost. Once copyright has fallen completely, only kickstarter models will be able to fund larger productions. 
The world is changing, but your view is still strongly tied to the past.

I think the concept that big holders of existing currencies will flood money into bitcoin is perhaps mistaken.
Currency is not an investment, its rather more like a commodity - whats worse it is a commodity intentionally bereft of intrinsic value.
For those who wish to "invest" It makes more sense to put money into businesses related to the technology, so that value can grow. (For example, if you buy 1000 BTC it will only ever stay 1000 BTC at best. If you invest 1000BTC in a startup, it could become 2000 BTC in 20 years )
For those who wish to "speculate", it absolutely makes sense to buy, sell, and play with currency options. Speculators very seldom add value however, their activites are strictly a zero sum game. For them to win, someone has to lose. They do not create value, they just move it around. If a bunch of speculators buy bitcoin to drive up the price, they could just as easily sell and short it to drive the price down. Its more desireable for actual users of the currency not to have to deal with speculative bubbles and crashes.
What wil drive up the price of bitcoin vs other currencies is its use as a currency. If and only if it becomes more popular for buying and selling vs other currencies will its value begin to rise vs those other currencies. 
As a currency it has much to offer, so my hope is for slow, steady, and pronoucedly unexicting growth in usage and value over decades to come.

That is incorrect. If both you and I have a cup of water, we pour them together into a bucket, then pour them back into our glasses, each glass is mixed, and you can say each glass is now 50% your water, and 50% my water. If you do that again with many other glasses of water, at some point you can say that only a very small fraction of the water perhaps 0.00000001% came from your original glass. And even though you still have exactly one glass of water, it is now indistignuishable from millions of other glasses.
Bitcoin works **exactly** like that.
There is no inherent uniqueness.

Its not fully possible; nothing will be cheaper than transaction fees in the first place.
trust is also problematic because you have to share some information to do a coin join.
The best thing to do now is to use any of the hundreds of srvices and sites that allow anonymous btc deposit/withdraw and understand how to check taint on your own.
(follow significant satoshi value back up the blockchain until you either hit a well known address or the source becomes well obscure.)

Tumbling is hard for people to understand. Its a new concept.
The blockchain is completely public, not anonymous, and every transaction is tracked. Its also completely anonymous and non-traceable, because at some point you can never tell which path value really originated from.
The best analogy I can think of is human ancestry: each person is unique, but at some level back we are all related to each other. If you want to track an punish all of Genghis Khan's descendants, you will have to punish up to half of the worlds population.  
Every bitcoin transaction is like a wedding, childbirth, and death of the parent coins. How long are the children held to the parents crimes? One generation ? One thousand ? At some point, those child coins are related to nearly every coin on the planet.

the genesis block is small enough that a fakenode could simply know it. (we have to assume fakenodes fully understand our methods)
The idea is the form a question that only a full node can answer at a given point in time. The counter against this technique would be to forward any and all messages to a neighbor node and mimic what they do. So the ideal check would be one that the fakenode cannot simply forward as-in without understanding.

Electrum is great, and so far ahead of their time, but they have not chosen to comply with BIP39.
The rest of the industry seems to be centering on the standard, but the electrum team is not. 
Perhaps it is time to fork electrum and make a BIP-39 only version of it, and drop support for their 13 word and legacy uncompressed wallet formats...

Its not a question of computational power. 
Even a simple raspberry pi has enough power to trace the lineage of any coin all the back to its birth block. The CIA will have no such monopoly, everyone and anyone can do it, and that is the whole point.
*The point is that there is limited value to that intelligence.* I never suggested it is impossible to trace coin pedigree. Every single shred of value on the block chain will owe some part of its value to heists, thefts, and other known "taint" sources. Every single coin will owe some of its ancestry to great charity or acts of kindness. Most will be just boring everyday commerce.
You might as well try to trace the origin of each drop of water in a glass. Each drop has been used a million times over.
You wont get a fed knocking on your door to inform you that 1 part per billion of a glass of tap water on your table was previously used by a bank robber, not even if they can prove it beyond a shadow of a doubt.

How do you hold your bitcoins ? A hardware wallet is probably a bit expensive for only 1BTC at current prices, so I suspect you are using a different model.
If you are holding them personally, do you understand the security model involved?

I find analogies work well if the audience cannnot understand the crypto.
A bitcoin address is like a drinking glass.
Bitcoin value is like water.
An address with value in is is like a glass with some amount of water in it.
A multisig address is like multiple cups welded together, with different people holding the handles - they have to agree when to pour it. 
A transaction is like a bucket.  People pour water into the bucket, slosh it around, then pour it out into new glasses.
When you make a purchase, you pour some water from cups you hold into a bucket, then empty it out into a glass held by the merchant. You may receive change water into a glass of your own.
Taint is like dye or dirt in the water.
When you re-use a glass it gets dirty, and the dirt gets into the water. It is advised to never re-use a glass for best health.
Mixing/Tumbling is like mixing tainted water into buckets with clean water, to dilute the dye.

I would argue that it is not wasteful. I admit, years ago when studying hashcash I thought it was wasteful: rather than proof of work it looked like proof of waste. I couldnt imagine a utility.
In bitcoin, however, there is a work being done: the value is synchronizing. The effort going into those hashes proves that probabalitically all members of the network were working to a solution, and thus the block ordering is trustworthy. 
You can thus directly compare the worldwide energy used to mine a given block, against the value to society of having that block's transactions be irreversible.
You can directly compare this to the energy needed for a tranditional bank to facilitate a similar number of transactions with a similar value to society. How much energy is it worth to society to make sure there are no errors or double spends in those bank transactions: i suspect the latter costs more than the former.

I wonder if that really happened. I cant help but be skeptical.
A real criminal is not going to volunteer lots of extra information. 
I cant imagine a murderer outlining his whole nefarious plot, or a bank robber telling everyone who he spends his stolen money with that it came from a bank robbery. That stuff only happens in movies.
And of course it is a sting, that would give up the game far to easily. 
I really think the undercover agents arent actually telling them that it is a crime, because it would ruin their bust.

There are quite a few mixers which offer a false sense of security. I'm sure there are some that may trade you 10% identity tainted coins for ones which ar 80% tainted with major crimes, effectively worsening them.
In the end, I think each person will be responsible for determining their tolerance for taint. If you were selling fruits from a stand, and found one of your customers was regularly paying with you 100% tainted coins from a major heist, would you turn them in ?


I think at some point the opposite will happen. Just like Medieval England,  
"infirmities of title" - are provably stolen funds still fungible ? The answer, historically, has always been yes.
I think the society will always accept any coin, and even if it doesnt, it will never be difficult to convert them somehow.

@_date: 2015-02-12 01:27:39
He's wrong about the fungibility aspect. 
Individual gold coins do in fact contain information about their composition and where they were mined. 
A bitcoin contains no history, its value is destroyed and created fresh with each transaction. It seems the concept of taint and tumbling is hard for people to understand.
