Well yeah, beginning of 2017 it was ~$800. End of 2017 it was ~20,000. I stopped following the price after that, but if this trend continues, by end of 2018, it should be $800,000,000!

Before getting your teeth fixed, **shop around**. At least in the US, dentistry is arguably the easiest medical care to actually get quotes for before hand, and some offices charge significantly cheaper rates than others.
I looked into getting Invisalign, which is a brand-name product and the same regardless of what office you get it from, and some charged $2k while others charged $6k.

I-am-not-a-financial-advisor, but is that accurate? My general understanding of tax law is that the government usually takes a cut whenever an asset is transferred, not just when it's converted to cash. If I give, for free, stock or gold or real estate or a car to someone in the US, the US government will still tax the recipient by the estimated cash value of the asset.
By that same concept, if someone transfers Bitcoin from one person to another inside the US, wouldn't the government try to take some of it as tax?

It's not recommended to buy at at-all-time high. Unfortunately, that's all we've been seeing the last few weeks. I don't see how a $5000 jump in a mere week is sustainable. I was about to buy too, and I'm not now. Too risky.
@_date: 2017-12-09 10:51:56


How's that? The US has $20 trillion in debt. The US receives around $3.3 trillion in revenue each year. So even if the US cut 100% of spending, including mandatory spending, and put all revenue into paying off the debt, it would take at least 20/3.3 = 6 years. The US almost never cuts spending, so that's not going to happen. The best to hope for would be to a budget that's balanced so that's there's a slight surplus that would pay off the debt over the course of a couple decades...but greedy citizens who want "free" government services and corrupt politicians who don't have to care about the future ensure that's unlikely to happen. Most people only care about *right now*, and right now the debt is someone else's problem.

That's not my concern. I'm sold on bitcoin being better than fiat. My concern is why the conversion rate is $9700 per btc (now $11k) instead of, say $100 per btc. The pattern looks very much like the speculation bubble we've seen many times before, such as the dot-com bubble or the housing bubble.
Now, granted, those had tangible things that could fail and pop the bubble, such as dumb dot-com companies going bankrupt, or mortgages foreclosing. I don't see anything quite like that with btc, but that doesn't mean there isn't the same potential.

It kind of is. Yes, unlike the government, a person or corporation can't print more money, but that's not really fixing the government's problem in the long term either. It's only devaluing its money. It's pretty comparable to a person taking out a massive credit card debt with no limit. As long as that person keeps working forever and never has any problems and keeps paying their credit card bill, it'll be fine. Just like that that's an unlikely scenario, so is the government not having any problems. Nothing's free. Eventually, it all catches up.

The most obvious concern I have is with scalability of the blockchain. I briefly tried to setup a small computer to do bitcoin mining, but gave up when I realized the current blockchain was too big to store on my 120GB hard drive, and that size is only going to get exponentially larger as adoption grows. Now, yes, we have terabyte-sized drives now, but if bitcoin growth continues the way we see, miners are going to need dozens of petabyte sized drives to process the ledgers in a few years. I haven't heard anyone address that.

That's untrue. The US still hasn't paid back the debt from WWII. There's no way $21 trillion in debt can be paid back in "a couple years".
Yes, taxes can be used to *eventually* pay it back...if spending is less than tax revenue. It's a simple math equation. The debt goes down as long as spending is less than taxes...but it never is. We spend far more than we tax.

I agree. The problem is figuring out how to invest in Bitcoin so you're left with Google stock and not Pets.com stock.
Is everyone going to buy in at $30k only for the bubble to burst and the price to drop to $5k and then remain stable there? Or will it rise to $30k and then stay there? It's virtually impossible to predict, and that makes it a risky investment.

When you buy something using your credit or debit card, that transaction is processed by your bank or credit card company, and they usually apply a small fee to the merchant to compensate them for processing that transaction.
When you buy something with Bitcoin, that transaction is processed by all the people running Bitcoin miners, which is just a people verifying and updating the public ledger. These people are compensated either by Bitcoins or by explicit dollar fees.
If there's a persistent shortage of people updating the ledger...that could really cause Bitcoin value to take a dive because the whole premise of a currency is that you're able to trade it, and that trade's impossible without people updating the ledger.

Ours is more expensive be it's more heavily regulated while the government has less ability to control costs. I'd rather lower costs by stopping the government from meddling in the healthcare  and medical industries, not further increase the size of government and give away my consumer rights by nationalizing those industries.
And the British system is [far from perfect.]( They're struggling to control rising costs resulting from a corrupt inefficient bureaucracy being in control of the industry.
Yes, it sounds nice to just let government take over and run everything, but that just doesn't work. When you remove the profit motive from an industry, quantity and quality goes down. That's just human nature and how economies operate. The only thing universal healthcare would accomplish is that everyone would have equal access to terrible healthcare. You point to Europe as a success, but their systems are slowly failing while their costs are also going up.

First, it wasn't "out of nowhere". Kanye and Trump have been friendly for quite a while. Since before the election.
Second, Kanye didn't "back Trump". He just didn't virtue signal vitriolic hatred for Trump, which to most on the left is practically the same thing. Liberals are outraged because Kanye said such controversial things like, "I don't agree with everything anyone does. That's what makes us individuals. And we have the right to independent thought." Especially in Hollywood, you're not allowed to have independent thought. You have to hate not just Trump, but anyone to the right of Mao.
If anyone else had made Kanye's remarks in the context of anything else, it would have been ignored as mind-numbingly obvious and reasonable. But because it was Kanye violating liberal dogma, they now have to crush him, because there's nothing more dangerous to liberal ideology than someone thinking for themselves.

That's not true at all. For every Coca-Cola or Microsoft there are 10000 other stocks that went no where or failed and became delisted. It's a rather sneaky trick the exchanges play, because if you've ever analyzed stock price data, it probably won't include delisted stocks, causing you to form a survivorship bias where you think every stock is successful. They're not. Stocks become worthless all the time and the exhanges memory-hole them.
That's not to say abandon the stock market and buy gold. If you understand an industry and have confidence in a particular investment, then yes, it may very likely be a better investment, but in no way is "nearly every investment" better than gold. If that were true, no one would ever invest in gold. It's simply lower risk, but also a lower return.
@_date: 2018-05-25 01:52:02
Yeah, I noticed these things when I did some stock market analysis. When I compared news stories to major price changes, I saw the "breaking" news stories always lagged behind the price change by hours or even days. The journalists usually don't know shit. They're in the dark as much as anyone.

Is this not what my last section said? The keyword here is "wisely". Professional stock pickers don't beat the market in the long run, so it's unlikely causal investors like you and I will. If you have very in-depth knowledge of a market and can invest wisely, then I completely agree, that will be more lucrative, but that's atypical.
Honestly, the best bet is a indexed mutual fund. It invests in stocks but does so in a way that both diversifies and pegs it to the stock market's average performance. You save money because you're not paying fees for a stock picker, while it still performs about the same on average as a managed fund.
@_date: 2018-05-04 00:48:13


Heh, Bill Burr made the same point on his podcast. I can't say you're wrong that it might be a publicity stunt...but I don't see how it'll help him. As you say, he's made similar statements before around a new single or tour release, but it hasn't really helped him. In 2016, people walked out of his concert. If it does help him...then hell, good for him. Assuming it sells more records or concert tickets (which I doubt) it would be a pretty savvy PR move. He basically spent $0 to get free publicity for weeks. Maybe he's been getting some PR tips from Trump ;)


Yeah, he [got that hat in 2016.](


And there it is. A week ago, your fellow liberals would have called you a racist for daring to call any black guy retarded. Hell, Obama famously declared the term "retard" offensive and told everyone never to say it again, but Kanye's offended you so much, all your rules about civility are off the table.


I don't know what Kanye's opinion is, but that doesn't sound like a bad idea. That'll probably have more success than 8 years of Obama ever did. About the same number of people who were shot in Parkland get shot in Chicago each week, and it's mostly black on black gang violence, but yet Democrats tell us the biggest threat to black men are...police? The people trying to arrest the gang members killing everyone? Maybe Kanye looked back at the 100 years of Democrat rule in these big cities where the black standard of living has stagnated for decades, and he's not buying the line anymore that he *has* to vote Democrat if he wants a better future. Maybe he looks at the last year of the Trump administration, sees the cut in regulations and taxes and corresponding record high black employment, and he's thinking maybe Republicans might have something to offer? Nah, that can't be it. He must be retarded!


Again, this is what I'm talking about. Why do you assume a black millionaire living in a gated community like Kanye has anything in common with a gang banger in inner city Chicago? I'm white, and when some other white guy deals drugs or kills someone and gets arrested, why would I give a shit? I don't owe a god damn thing to someone else solely because we have the same skin color. The black community is not a monolith. Like everyone else, there are smart upstanding law abiding members and others who are pieces of garbage. Treating them all the same is just another form of racism.


For someone who gives zero shits about Kanye, you've certainly written a lot about Kanye. But I actually do agree with you. I don't really care about Kanye's political opinions or any other "rick fuck celebs". Kanye's a reasonably talented musician, but he knows relatively little about politics. Like everyone else, he's entitled to his political opinions, but he's no thought leader. I thought he was generally kinda weird before and I still think he's weird now. However, it's reactions from folks like you that I'm interested in. Before this, when any celebrity called Bush or McCain or Romney or Trump or any other Republican a racist, you'd probably shout, "right on", but now that one of these celebs flips the script and disagrees with you, suddenly he's a "retard" who's "voting against his own interests".


Lol, and here I thought we could have a reasonable discussion. I love the Trump == Hitler hysteria liberals push. It makes the bar so very low, all Trump has to do is not murder ten million Jews, and he's already ahead. Throw in the booming economy, strong support for Israel, and possible peace with North Korea, and he's got an excellent shot at a second term. So good luck with the Hitler comparisons, race-baiting, and telling black men they're "retards" for not voting the way you want. I'm sure that's going to win you lots of elections.

@_date: 2018-06-13 00:21:22
In a sense that it has no inherent value (unlike, say, gold that can be used for something other than money), yes. However, not having a fixed supply is **the** complaint with fiat currency. If I earned a US dollar, and I didn't have to worry about the US government printing a trillion more of them, effectively making my dollar worth less, I wouldn't give a shit about Bitcoin because the dollar would be doing its job as a currency.
That said, the modern politician's inability to curb spending or raise taxes means the only way they have to stop the economy from crashing is by manipulating the value of money, and the effect of that is that everyone else's money loses value. So as long as politician's have no spine, Bitcoin will have a future.

This is a little misleading. It's not normalized to take into account population growth. e.g. There are a lot more people now then there was when the telephone was first invented, so naturally something like Pokemon Go will reach a fixed number of users faster than the phone, even though relatively smaller percent of the population uses Pokemon Go than the phone.
A better metric would be "X percent of the population".

If you're going to nitpick over such technical minutia, then I don't see what type of meaningful debate you expect to have. Yes, but your strict definition, there have been no governments ever, as no government operates exactly as laid out in some academic textbook. You're trying to hide in the weeds to avoid the more general point that socialism is a very flawed ideology.
And yes, I'm using informal definitions because this is Reddit, not an academic symposium on the evils of socialism. The bottom line is that socialism, in general, values government control vastly over individual rights, and that historically, governments tend to be run by incompetent people at best, or evil people at worst. Therefore it's foolish to introduce socialist policies into government as the capability for government to cause harm increases.

I'm not sure the comparison between Bitcoin and sub-prime mortgages is fair. Bitcoin is a currency and is backed by the same intangible "value" as any other currency. If anything, it's more robust than a fiat currency because it can't be deflated by a government printing more of it.
The sub-prime mortgage crisis happened because the people were being sold something, and being told it had a tangible value that it did not in fact have. People were told, "invest in this and it will deliver X dividends". Then the people who couldn't afford the mortgages started defaulting, those defaults meant no dividends, which meant the value of those investments disappeared, and that cascaded through the market. I'm not sure how that could happen to Bitcoin.

No it's not, and no they shouldn't. A utility is something you get that you can't easily change, like your water main or gas line. In that case, some government regulation is necessary to prevent abuse, and also given as a concession so lot's of companies don't clutter up the streets with redundant water mains and gas lines. The Internet doesn't work that way. People claim that ISPs are all monopolies, but that's a lie. The vast majority of people have options, and can chose between multiple ISPs.
If you believe in Bitcoin, which is designed to have no government regulation, yet want the government to massively regulate the Internet, you're a huge hypocrite.

Let me guess, "real" socialism has never been tried, right? Few want to give away the "means of production" that they spent their entire lives building. So you can't have mandatory "common ownership" without an authoritarian government strong enough to take away private property, which is why communism/socialism and authoritarian dictators go hand in hand. Stalin had to kill and imprison thousands of farmers who refused to give up their farms to the state. The result was "common ownership" of farms...that under-produced, resulting in mass starvation. It was so bad in Ukraine at the start of WWII, that some Ukrainians actually welcomed the Nazi invasion because it drove back the communists who had been killing them.


And small factories, and mom and pop stores, and farms, and anything anyone built that makes something. Ayn Rand, famous critic of communism, fled Russia and saw her family's small drug store business stolen by communists first hand. So you're making two big false assumptions, 1) that communists only care about "big" factories, and that 2) it's ok to confiscate wealth and property from successful businesses of any size. The size of the enterprise is irrelevant. It's immoral to steal from anyone. Period. Venezuela nationalized all their oil fields, and their production immediately lowered and became immensely inefficient because no government bureaucrat or commissar, with no personal incentive by being rewarded with the fruits of their labor, is going to run a public enterprise as well as a private enterprise.


Now it's you who needs to look up some definitions. State capitalism is, like socialism, where the government owns the means of production...but also where it runs those means of production for a profit. Therefore, communists Russia et al weren't state capitalists. The communists in Russia weren't running state farms for a profit. Venezuela isn't running state oil fields for a profit. If they were, maybe they'd be marginally more successful, if not still immoral.


Well, no, Russia's not anymore because the USSR collapsed under it's centrally controlled "common ownership" economy. China, although they still call themselves communists, adjusted their economy to a free market capitalist model, because they didn't want to collapse like the Soviets, and because their "common ownership" of the means of production resulted in the deaths of millions of Chinese. Venezuela though absolutely still is a socialist state, and was heaped with praise by anarcho-communists like [Noam Chomksy]( as a brilliant example of what a true socialist revolution should look like. Now Venezuelans are resorting to eating rats to survive, and all the arm-chair socialists like you are trying to pretend like you've never heard of Venezuela. They **democratically elected** a leader to give them free stuff by confiscating the means of production from all the evil rich people, just as you claim to want. Then ran those means of production, "for the people" and not for a profit, just as you claim to want. And it worked...for a few years, until they finally ran out of other people's money, and the entire system collapsed, just like every socialist dystopia eventually does.
You ever wonder why communists are desperate to run away from examples of their failure, like the United Soviet **Socialist** Republics, and re-brand their ideology? Communists re-brand themselves as socialists. Then socialists re-brand themselves as democratic socialists. It's because none of it works, but there will always be political opportunists that will harness your hatred and envy of people more successful than you to "take away the means of production" and give it to you. It's a tempting message, but an amoral one.

Communism killed more people than Hitler. Millions died of starvation alone in Russia and China after farms were confiscated by the government, with many more dying in purges when people refused to go alone with this "egalitarian" redistribution of wealth.

Apple doesn't make money because they have a magical money tree. They make money because they make products that people want to buy more than their competitor's products. When was the last new product they introduced? That stupid iWatch a few years ago that no one bought?
Apple's still cruising on their success of the Macbook and iPhone, which were novel enough in their day, but are now stale and overpriced compared to competitors. I had a Macbook. It was ok. I wouldn't buy a Mac now because virtually everyone else has better quality at a lower cost.

I think the point is that people look at bitcoin losing a tiny amount of value as proof that it's a poor currency or investment, and that traditional tools like stocks are better, but then Apple will lose more value in a day than all of what Bitcoin is worth, and no one says the stock market is a waste of time.
I know, the rationale's a little sloppy, because it's comparing a relative value, like a percent of Bitcoin, to an absolute value, like the total drop in Apple's price. I don't personally think Apples a good investment. They don't innovate anymore, and their CEO's a joke, but that drop represents a fraction of the company's overall value.
However, I think the comparison makes a little sense. Few people are going to freak out over this drop in Apple's price. Hell, their CEO's blaming it all on Trump anyways. Meanwhile, it Bitcoin had a drop like this, it'd be used as proof that Bitcoin had failed.

No one's saying laws banning something completely stop it 100%. Murder is illegal but people still murder. However, laws do dramatically cut down on the action. Controlled substances can be bought illegally, but they're not as accessible as they would be if they could be sold over the counter. Alcohol was available during prohibition, but in limited quantities and in poor quality. After prohibition, quality increased and quantity skyrocketed. Sure, if government tried to ban Bitcoin, some people would still be doing it, but 100% of the exchanges would close and probably 99% of users wouldn't want to bother with the hassle. The price would also plummet as most people tried to sell their now less useful currency.

Hi Dale. I don't mean this to sound insulting, but isn't that what every addict says until they try to stop using drugs and realize they can't? Addiction isn't caused just by drugs. It's wiring in the brain formed through a reward feedback loop. Anything that produces pleasure can become addictive with enough misuse. It's just that some things, like drugs, cause addictions to form faster. You'll find that, over time, your brain will learn that "having fun" through the low energy act of taking a drug will outweigh virtually all other more long-term productive forms. That's my take, anyways. Maybe I'm wrong. I hope you say ok.


Sure it does. Price is a function of supply and demand. Hypothetically, if we made supply equal for all drugs and made them all legal, the only factor would be demand, and that's based on how much people want a particular drug. Yes, addiction isn't the only factor into why someone wants a drug...but it's a massive part of demand. People don't typically buy alcohol because it's a good antiseptic. They buy it because when they consume it, it makes them feel good for a short time, at the expensive of their long term happiness. If all drugs were legalized tomorrow, I'd bet we'd see a lot more demand for the more addictive drugs than for, say, pot, even though pot may have some other beneficial uses.


I agree. I'm just saying it's a factor that will help it maintain value, or as you said, "set a minimum market value".

I agree. On a policy level, it would be both hypocritical and dumb. But then again, like you said, the great socialist idiot FDR pushed for the ban on private gold ownership, so who knows what the future may hold. What the spirit of the Constitution says and what politicians do are not always the same.

Only if you think Bitcoin is as addictive as drugs and alcohol. The mechanisms behind Gold are a bit more complicated, as it has tangible value. You can't create wires or tooth filings out of Bitcoin. Whenever a government has even hinted at a ban or even regulation, Bitcoin's price has taken a steep dive. I doubt you're going to see a 75% gold jump if it suddenly becomes more difficult to trade.

Yeah, people who are easily manipulated are dolts.
Which reminds me, Bitcoin's going to the moon!!! Buy buy buy!
