Oh look!  A distorted quote taken way out of context by some Core shills, completely ignoring his actual truthful economic argument here:  
 Stay classy, r/bitcoin

Being a cheapskate... Please. It's not his fault. The blocksize should've been increased by now.

This is perhaps the dumbest argument I've ever seen. Brexit is good for the british people, especially in the long run, but not good for the Oligarchs or Corporations. In a similar vein, Blockstream looks out for their own interests first, and are terrible leaders.

LOL, get the hell outta here... It's as simple as increasing blocksize. This new mentality of "freeloaders" is F'ing moronic. Bitcoin was designed to be fee-free for the first 10+ years of its existence until a fee market is actually necessary (after the block reward has gone down to near zero)
If you want a Central Banker settlement-coin with high fees, make your own coin, don't hijack Bitcoin

Mcafee was falsely accused of murder by a corrupt government that supports terrorism. Any negative reputation is highly undeserved. He has taken on some very powerful people and made progress that most people couldn't get away with.

"Socialist mentality"
No, that's the Satoshi mentality. There is no need for fees to be &gt; a few cents at any given time. Limiting space on the train for no reason other than to justify the creation of Lightning Network and an artificial "fee market" is not a good idea. We're practically giving marketshare away at this point.

Crap FUD, we need a blocksize increase or else bitcoin can't scale. LN won't be ready for years. FUD post from OP

Are western union users happy to pay fees? People pay them because they have too. 
@_date: 2016-07-14 20:08:16
You know that is different than limiting tx capacity right? We can't wait around another 4 years for LN to maybe be ready.

No, you're the whack job ;)

He would almost certainly be banned for "FUD" or "trolling" or what have you. This subreddit is the worst, censored crap. Theymos is perhaps the worst moderator in history.

Samson Mow has demonstrated over and over again that he is a highly immature douche... I don't think anyone should ever take him seriously. He doesn't even try to argue anything logically, he just throws around childish insults and thinks he can get away with it since he's rich and occupies a high position in a Chinese bitcoin company.
@_date: 2016-07-14 20:02:52
"Try sending gold across the world"? Really? Your argument is pointlessly redundant. We can handle a larger blocksize to double our userbase w/o having to artificially limit tx capacity. No need for unnecessary limitations!
@_date: 2016-07-14 20:07:49
If fees are high it means users are being kicked off the network. FAIL
@_date: 2016-07-14 20:14:37
The artificial limit is not somehow valuable. It is a source of great contention and constant arguments. We want our userbase to triple... won't happen with a fee market or without scaling.
@_date: 2016-07-02 17:37:08
You must be out of your mind. If you want to diverge from Satoshi's vision so much, go make your own altcoin
@_date: 2016-07-14 10:51:49
Joke argument. Doesn't even make sense.
I just sent a tx using a recommended fee of 7 cents. That was 2 hours ago. It still has not one confirm. If your goal is to make bitcoin slow and unusable and to turn users onto other altcoins since it can't scale, well, then mission accomplished.
