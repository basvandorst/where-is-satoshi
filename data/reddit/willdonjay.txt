What tracker do you use?

I strongly agree. By paying off all of his obligations, he no longer has that overhead to worry about. He's basically bought himself more peace of mind and a better quality of life. A person in his situation could switch careers to something they enjoy far more, even if it pays less. Hell, he can use that freed up income for vacations or doing stuff with family or more investments.
Where would you be financially if you didn't have to worry about rent/mortgage, your vehicles, your children's education?

But never 90% of my $20 transaction.
BTC will get where it needs to be, but saying it's not so bad because of ATM fees is just disingenuous.

From reading other comments, I've gleaned that if you start to lose too much money on the short and it exceeds a degree of the assets you used to set up the contract, it gets instantly closed and called in.

This headline is foolish. 
For a $4 ATM fee I can take out a several hundreds of dollars and then continue to make transactions with that cash with no additional cost. 
For BTC right now I'm paying $15 to move some coin from one wallet to another? Then additional high fees for each side quest transaction? Plus the wait time?

The prisoner's dilemma in real life. That sucks.

In the US only. 
In Canada here, no idea how I'm going to eventually sell. :-P

I'm really looking forward to lightning and other future tech improving every part of our process, but let's not delude ourselves. Nobody is going to an ATM to withdraw 20k. 
You say a 20-25% fee is too high if you just want to withdraw $20? Alright. 
There was a post just this week (on Bitcoinbegginers I think?) from someone about how they got started with .001 BTC, but when they went to move it off the exchange like all the helpful advice told them to, they discovered the fees were going to be .0009 BTC. This person wanted safe access to their $19 and would've gotten charged $17 for it. 
Don't try to tell me the current BTC transaction realities aren't so bad because in comparison -some- ATM's charge over $4.

As long as these coins don't hit an exchange, it's basically impossible to find out who the owner is, correct?
How would a rich person go about breaking free of the initial wallet and completing their getaway? Seems to me like it doesn't matter how many splits or jumps happen if they can all be tracked like this.

Far better use of your cash than lottery tickets.
