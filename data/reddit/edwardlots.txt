I have no enemies.  You don't see me saying shit to you about your negative crypto posts.  I say shit to because he never says anything constructive to prove his point.  He just trolls and posts a bunch of bs.
No one else seems to think anything bad about my posts.  Like I said Ive helped people on here, written guides, and started a LTC sub for beginners.  And I have only been on Reddit for 2 months.

I have never used Gox but I do hate them for all of the bad shit they have done to BTC.
I do think that if Gox goes under and tons and tons of people lose money it will be **terrible** for BTC.  Think of every single article in the past two years about BTC that has stated a price has **always** stated them as "trading at xxx on Gox" or "reached a high of xxx at the BTC exchange Mt Gox".
Until recently no mainstream news has ever mentioned another exchange, and nobody who isnt into crypto know any others exist.  If Gox goes down hard it will hurt BTC bad.  I dont think it will kill BTC but it will push BTCs adoption progress back.  Maybe **way** back.
That being said I think this is what the BTC community should do.  Hope like hell that Gox doesnt go down in a self ignited ball of flames.  If they dont everyone should pull all of theyre money and BTC out of Gox and everyone should tell everyone they know and post everywhere they can not to use Gox.
The best thing would be if Gox figured it out, got everything enabled again, people got theyre money out, and no body ever used Gox again.  I doubt it will happen like that but from now on we need to add **never use Mt. Gox** to our list of common sense things to do when dealing with BTC.  Like never store BTC on an online wallet.

So he obviously told one of his minions to "Send this to all of the people who emailed us about BTC."

I do live in W VA.  I indicated that on the form I filled out when sending him an email.  It asks for your address.
He doesn't care.

I would imagine you think so.  Anything positive about crypto is terrible to you.  Keep working on the most negative karma ever.

Cyber security is something that most people not only don't care about it's something that most people cant understand even if you tell them.
I have given up on trying to tell people about trying to protect themselves online and with computers in general.
Most people are just so stupid when it comes to computer security.
After spending an hour convincing one of my friends why he should install AV on his Windows computer I go to his house a few days later.  This friend has a decent amount of LTCs on his computer.  (I talked him into paying me to building him a rig.)
He says his computer is running slow that ESET doesn't work it's a scam.
I look at it and said how did all these programs get on here they weren't here the other day?  He says he was trying to download music torrents.
I say didn't ESET warn you?
He says yea but I thought it was because I was downloading music torrents and you know it's illegal so I thought that why so I just kept clicking ignore.
Shit like this happens all the time.  Most people are just so ignorant when it comes to security.
And as a side note.  Somehow which I have no idea how he has not had any coins stolen.  He has had coins on his Windows computer for over a year.   Good amounts of coins too.  Until about a few weeks ago he had no AV.   And as you can tell from my above convo he has absolutely 0 knowledge about security.

These kind of people only are motivated by stuff that threatens they're re election and telling them this is a no negotiation issue.  You have to draw the line clearly for them.
As in:
Either you reverse your stance or I will do everything I can to make sure you never get reelected.  I am prepared to spend my personal time and money and will not stop until you are out of office.
This is a no negotiation issue for me.  Either reverse your stance or I will physically and financially support anyone who runs against you until you are not re elected.
Something like that.

As you know......
He says this like were all gonna say whoa, dude really knows how BTC works.  Thats probably the only two sentences he remembers from when somebody tried to explain it to him.
I have been thinking of writing him back and/or calling him.  I really dont  think it will make a difference though.  The guy is obviously talking out of his ass.

Just another reason to mine P2Pool.  And even better is by running your own P2Pool node.

Yea afraid your stuck here.  With selling / buying crypto against PayPals TOS you are technically in violation of theyre TOS.  So not much you can do.  Thats why it has been advised again and again not to use reversible payment methods when dealing in crypto.
I do see some sellers on locallitecoins and localbitcoins using PayPal that say use "As a gift" option, which I would assume would mean its not disputable but I have no idea as I stay away from PayPal as much as possible.
Even besides crypto PayPal is the worst.

Like most people who think they're smarter than everyone else he never says anything to backup what he says.  It's all just pump and dump blah blah your screwed blah blah your a dumb ass blah blah.
FUCK YOU TROLL!  Your stupid comments mean nothing to anyone.  Get a life or at least find some other thing to troll all day. 
@_date: 2014-03-22 22:46:06
DO NOT FEED THE TROLL!!!
-600+++ karma and counting.   Never anything to say to support his decision just nonsense and shit taking. 
Everyone is entitled to they're opinion but this troll is just causing trouble.   I have not saw one post that had anything constructive to say.
@_date: 2014-03-21 02:37:49
I tried.  I told him that if he didn't educate himself and continued to pursue this stance that I would do everything in my power including spending money to get anyone who runs against him elected.
I don't think he cares because he knows that our elections here in the US mean nothing now a days.
@_date: 2014-03-23 17:24:55
I apologize I got you confused for I have helped many people here.  If you think my posts are terrible than you are entitled to your opinion.  It still doesn't have anything to do with getting the troll to stop posting stupid nonsense on the boards.  That is if you are not the same person.  Or your just sticking up for another crypto hater.
@_date: 2014-03-21 04:36:10
Nobody feed the troll.   He already has -551 karma.  Can't get much worse.
