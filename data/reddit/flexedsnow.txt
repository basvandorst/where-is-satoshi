Also not true.  Publicly traded companies issue new stock at times.  By your logic, I believe you’re suggesting that a company’s share price can’t increase if supply (number of shares) can increase. 
Again, all that matters is that there is a market and that there is demand for the product/commodity.  The motivation for buying cannot be boiled down to something as simple as, “supply is limited and therefore there is value, and whether you know it or not, this is there reason you as a buyer see value in this investment.”

Also to say that the reason people are buying bitcoin is bc it is scarce, whether they know it or not, is simply not true.  There are many reasons why people buy bitcoin and for most, it is not for the reason that it is a scarce commodity that can not be diluted.  A ready market with people willing to exchange money for something in return indicates that a good has value.  That can be said for bitcoin.  If people feel as though they can purchase bitcoin and get some return based on its high variance, then people will do so.  That is the motivation for most who invest in bitcoin.  There are some who invest because they appreciate the scarce, unable to be dissolved attribute, but to say that is why everyone is investing whether they know it or not is just wrong.
