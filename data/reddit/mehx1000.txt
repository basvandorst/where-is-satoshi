Bitcoins would flow out of Gox and into other markets.  This would make bitcoins more valuable on Gox, and less valuable in other markets, as people would be trying to unload $270 bitcoins for a profit elsewhere.  Equilibrium would quickly be reached somewhere between $270 and $6XX.
A discount for Gox Bitcoins may persist due to loss of trust in Gox.

What are you trying to say?

The cool thing is that things like stocks and housing prices rise with inflation.  Stuffing fiat in a mattress is probably a bad idea, but if you put it to work it does fine.

You’ve been breathing your own exhaust for far too long.  Managing an economy is a very delicate matter.   None of the cryptos have demonstrated that they can do that effectively.   I’m sure they will evolve into something better over time, but there’s nothing that makes me want to dump my hard earned money into them right now.    I’m happy for you that you are making 6000% gains.  That is a reward for taking an extraordinary risk.

Sell now and double your holdings when you buy it back at 4K.

If it makes you feel any better most of these people will never get their money or bitcoin out of the exchange.  They will realize that the tech doesn’t mean shit if someone else is holding the keys to your fortune.   When this thing starts imploding good luck moving money out.  I would make that a priority at this point.

Haha the military can't attack Bitcoin.  They can go drone sand.

The rate is set by the market, i.e. the willingness of people/entities to loan money to the U.S. and also the willingness of people/entities to buy existing notes from other people/entities.

Dollar cost average.  Just buy a fixed dollar amount every day.   Not a fixed bitcoin amount.
