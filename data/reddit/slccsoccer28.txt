If you have 3 million in the bank, you'd be losing money. The financially smart thing to do would be move a good part of that money to some sort of safe investment. 
Currently, a very conservative and safe investment is anticipated to yield 4% with very, very low risk. If you have good credit, you can get a mortgage in the ballpark of 3.5%. This does two things:
1. You basically make 0.5% of interest for free. On 3 million, that's $15k. If you can get better rates on either side, that's more money.
2. Transfers much of the risk of a home to the bank. Let's say we do hit another major financial crisis. You're out of a job, out of work, along with everybody else. All of that money could have been tied up in your house is available to you. Unless the crisis lasts the entire duration of your remaining loan, that money will be more valuable as a liquid asset than as equity in a (valueless) home.

As someone with a SO in med school, the financial rewards take a long time to be realized. If you're past 40 (even really 35), med school only makes sense if you want the challenge of med school.
* 4 years of tuition at $40k/year = $160k
* 4 years of loss job income. $400k (If you have the capacity for med school, you likely have the capacity for a $100k+ job by 40). 
* 3 to 5 years of residency. ~$50k/year. Still, $50k+ short of where you be in a professional field. $200k.
Total cost of med school and related salary losses: ~$760k. Not including student loan interest or any expenses to cover living.
Salary expectations for mid-range doctors vary drastically, but $200k is a safe middle for a mid-career doctor.
Comparatively, you during those 8 years you could advance to senior or executive level management. $150k is not an unreasonable amount for senior or executive management. 
That means a late-life doctor only comes over $50k ahead per year compared to a stead-fast executive. $760k would take a little over 15 years to break even. For all of the extra stress, hours, and frustration of med school, there's a lot better things you could do with your time (and even make more money).

I don't have a horse in this race lol. Right now, I view it as just short of gambling. 
There are still some major regulatory and value obstacles BTC faces.  In America, I don't know of a single person that uses BTC in a meaningful way. The USD is simply too strong, consistent, and widely accepted for most people to have day-to-day value. I do see value in 3rd word countries where their fiat currency is basically useless. I think it's incredible that they can move their money out of fiat currency to protect their (little) wealth.  That being said, it also comes with a whole host of well-needed compliance and regulatory oversight.
As a software developer, I am also not yet convinced BTC is strong enough to sustain a targeted attack from a world super-power. An organized attack by USA or China could easily swing BTC. Perhaps not a destructive amount, but enough to highly influence trade ratios. If a super power could accurately introduce a 0.1% change every day and predict exactly when peaks and troughs will occur, they can existentially dictate outcomes.
I think Crypto will be a significant player in the future, but I do not believe BTC will be that player. Personally, I think a super-power backed crypto will be the only way the public en-masse will get onboard. We have yet to see that.

Until you have it as cash sitting in a traditional, insured and regulated bank account you have nothing but a bunch of BTC. BTC is only as valuable as the ability to exchange it for valuable goods. Since the open day-to-day market for BTC is basically nothing, you only have the potential to be a millionaire.
Congratulations. Just don't put the cart before the horse.

IMO, this is half good advice. 
A loan is a good idea as interest rates are so low on mortgages that you can literally make money by taking out a loan and investing the difference. 
I however, would not keep it "saved" in BTC which is arguably extremely high risk. I'd look to move it to more traditional stocks and funds with historically lower risk.

This is a different discussion - rent vs buy.
Buying a house with a loan is almost always a smart thing to do, even if you have the money to buy the house straight up.
