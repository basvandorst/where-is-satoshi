100% maybe

what is going on then?

I am not smart but my thoughts are because more people are getting into it year after year, more big money is buying it, there are more and more services being created to support it including big venture capital being put into a lot of it.  Easier to use year after year.  More companies accepting it year after year.  Year over year the average price of it has gone up.  We see as currency in certain countries fail people are moving to it.  Those are just the few reasons I suspect but also no one can predict what will happen so don't listen to me.

i will buy your btc right now for $1,000 to save you the embarrassment when it finally dies after all these years of dying.

Do you not actually see it's sarcasm?  The dude, I wrote to even understood it.

I agree to this if it is 2 btc or more.  Bitcoin is dying and is going to go to zero, so that is a steal in the future when BTC is worth $0.

Bitcoin is dying, you will wish you sold to me before it reaches 0.  You also will wish you understood sarcasm you fucking clown! ;)

People forget that you die and your money doesn't go with you.  You could be hit by a bus tomorrow.  We want more money so we can do awesome stuff with it not to just sit on it.
