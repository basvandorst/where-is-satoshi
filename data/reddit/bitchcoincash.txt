Thats what he said

Might as well, lord knows they have enough to enter that market.
@_date: 2018-09-11 11:00:26
I would own the fuck out of that
@_date: 2018-09-04 15:35:34


HaHa I like that one
@_date: 2018-09-21 19:13:30
Lmfao I don't fuck 16 year olds ergo im feminine? You just keep beating that drum. I'm sure one of your kind will come along to support your argument.
@_date: 2018-09-12 23:44:54
Por que?
@_date: 2018-09-01 15:32:23
Im reading this now. It reads akin to an economics text book. I mean, I'm digging it, but I'd imagine its a tough read for folks only interested in passing. Looks cool on the shelf though.
@_date: 2018-09-01 00:54:19
Buyer beware. That's the bitcoin way.
@_date: 2018-09-21 18:17:20
Im a dude and I find it creepy. What's that dudes gender got to do with anything here?
@_date: 2018-09-05 04:52:49
Looks super cool. Good work!
@_date: 2018-08-24 03:32:07
Depends on the state
@_date: 2018-08-18 02:24:33
Look, what everyone here really wants to know is, where does the btcpayserver-docker put the data.bk file by default and is it a docker fragment that gets me docker setup but custom blockchain dir? 
@_date: 2018-08-01 07:42:51
Premined tho.
@_date: 2018-08-18 04:22:58
That's helpful information. Thank you.
@_date: 2018-08-18 15:06:09
see this right here is why we can occasionally have nice things. Thank you. I'll be sure to kick a few bits your way for continued beer consumption whilst developing. 
@_date: 2018-08-21 23:22:59
What was the end result? Culprit caught?
@_date: 2018-08-21 23:22:27
We've had them a few years now but its only recently we've begun being required to use the chip reader.
@_date: 2018-08-18 13:48:45
export BTCPAYGEN_ADDITIONAL_FRAGMENTS="opt-save-storage-s"
Is this automatic to prune to your available disk or are you specifying prune size by editing opt-save-storage prior to executing the setup.sh?
@_date: 2018-08-21 22:54:01
I would think a quarter is an acceptable threshold for 0conf. I'd wait 4 hours for a quarter. I wouldnt even stress over it. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 15:31:26
Ayyyyy Monero. I was gonna bitch but I see my flavor now.
@_date: 2018-06-17 04:49:22


Well hello. Aren't you a good looking cash. Cheers!
@_date: 2018-06-18 14:54:36
Should have used Monero
@_date: 2018-06-18 03:30:02
I'm skeptical but interested.
@_date: 2019-08-30 21:05:13
because 1 btc = 1 btc? Boss man has the biggest stack. That makes him the richest alive.
@_date: 2018-06-14 00:21:53
Its not hard to buy some bitcoin. Cash app registration takes about 3 minutes from start to btc.
@_date: 2018-06-18 14:47:59
Sounds like a great way for narcissists to get their rocks off helping the beggars they deem fit. Gross. (Great idea tho, not knocking the idea)

Ok, weve officially been warned. Go warn some other community now plz kthnx bye
@_date: 2018-06-25 06:39:58
In what context?
@_date: 2018-06-29 15:26:45
And its not even that good of a beer. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 16:02:04
Interesting. That's not the direction I expected you to go.
@_date: 2018-06-02 05:36:29
Yes, you can. I've done my last 5 or so purchases via cash app and have moved it off to an offline wallet. (Verified)
@_date: 2018-06-16 10:59:16


Thats what I've been shooting for. Nailed it! Have an excellent day.
@_date: 2018-06-16 02:48:37
Hurry up and comment fuckers, I want to talk about this but have no original thoughts of my own.
@_date: 2018-06-26 16:22:57
Ayyy shout out to Ohio, the state that drives more people off this planet than any other.
@_date: 2018-06-16 10:02:17
I am totally a bcash fan. In case you were unaware, bcash is a fork of bitcoin that incorporates zcash privacy tech to keep your transactions private. Not a lot of progress there though unfortunately. Still a really long way to go before we see any real adoption. I'm also a fan of Bitcoin Core (ticker btcc, currently trading at a whopping $1.47, good job guys! We can do it!). Bitcoin (BTC) will always have my heart though as well as the primary slot on my ledger nano s. I dont want to forget Bitcoin Cash. Centralized China shitcoin Bitcoin Cash (bch) can go suck it. Hows that for confusing.

This "article" is very poorly written. Get some native English speakers to proofread your works. The translating service you are using is not sufficient. 
@_date: 2019-10-03 11:15:19
Good morning!
@_date: 2018-06-25 07:47:10
Compensation for what?
@_date: 2018-06-14 07:27:54
Bitcoin core is the bitcoin reference client. Think of it as the standard other bitcoin clients are based on.
@_date: 2019-10-02 13:52:24
Btcpayserver does that. Dm me if you need help. (I'm at work right now but I can help you later)
@_date: 2018-06-16 03:15:31
I dont know anything about that but I bet walmart is pissed waltonchain is already taken
@_date: 2018-06-18 15:01:02
This right here is the maximum amount of time im going to waste on you. You are shouting at windmills. You're here to shake us of our convictions and your argument is weaksauce. Truly, we heard you, now go away. You are an end times preacher shouting on a corner in an atheist metropolis. We see you but we dont care about your message. Bitcoin will live longer than you.
@_date: 2019-10-03 16:22:51
No worries, he didn't.
@_date: 2019-04-26 18:13:34
If they did do that they did us a favor by keeping blocks small for now. Maximize the 1mb format with as much advancement as possible before you start inflating those blocks. It helps us in the long run.
@_date: 2019-04-26 15:57:33
Why parasites? We need all the development we can get
@_date: 2019-04-26 08:38:56
Anyone else ignoring all the BS and just going about daily life stacking sats? Fuck the drama.
@_date: 2018-11-28 10:29:10
Its about damned time. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 17:09:37
I use squares cash app. Its pretty damned fast
@_date: 2018-11-30 21:52:31
Whats that supposed to mean?
@_date: 2018-11-26 17:04:54
Thanks for supporting the community in our time of ...is it need? Want? Need. Definitely time of need.
@_date: 2018-11-26 17:14:52
Thats like going to walmart and demanding the kmart branded stuff. You are literally in the wrong place. Hes not wrong, you are. Goto r/cryptocurrency and try again there.
@_date: 2018-11-26 09:18:52
I bought my first bitcoins when they were 50cents a piece for some online purchases. When the hard drive crashed I didnt think anything of it. I mean, shit, they were 50 cents. No big deal right? Yeah. Still kicking myself.
@_date: 2018-11-26 12:23:14
Technically I still have them as I recycle all my pc parts. Its in a stack of hard drive platters that I had planned to use for art. Non recoverable in afraid. It was only 40 coins so not a huge loss to bitcoin as a whole. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 14:30:30
Ver cares deeply, he just went astray of the right side of this. He used to be one of the good guys.
@_date: 2018-11-26 14:58:46
He absolutely does. No doubt about it. But to say he never cared about bitcoin is disingenuous. The guy is a creep and quite frankly the truth about him is enough. We dont need to add extra boogey to the boogeyman.
@_date: 2018-07-25 04:40:41
I second the square cash app. Its fast and slightly cheaper and definitely just as easy
@_date: 2018-07-30 05:59:19
It was an American right? Half a meal. Whole pizza, tiny side salad, 82 breadsticks. Thats a pizza dinner
@_date: 2018-07-28 18:29:16
Two words. Monero. You can say it twice if you'd like.
@_date: 2018-07-30 05:51:41
Good thing OP isnt a dick.
@_date: 2019-09-21 23:20:06
cool. thank you
@_date: 2019-09-11 19:02:30
It is. its called BTCPayServer
@_date: 2018-07-28 16:55:15
Thats not quite how this works...
@_date: 2018-07-30 05:56:48
Honestly? I do it because its fun. Its new, its tech advanced, and the guy next to me hasnt a clue what I'm talking about.
@_date: 2018-07-29 05:06:21
Drug proceeds rejoice! I would imagine usage would be through the roof comparatively. Usage of bitcoin and usage as a laundering tool but of course thats the ignored truth to any cash system.
@_date: 2019-09-20 19:33:01
You were seeing the admin panel / back end. I have a few ecommerce sites that use the BTCPayServer plugin to receive crypto and it works very well with integrating the checkout flow. Easily comparable to the bitpay experience but without the funky address encoding. I also don't self host the BTCPayServer implementation, I use [BTCPayJungle.com]( and [lightbo.lt]( to do the heavy lifting. Both are free (for now) services and again, super easy to set up. If you are doing your ecommerce on one of the popular platforms like woocommerce or prestashop the plugins are stupid easy to use and are open source on the github page. You can be up and running accepting crypto is just a few minutes quite frankly.

For which device? Bread on iphone and mycelium or samauri for droid are great options.
@_date: 2019-09-03 18:48:49
What made you think he had used the n word? just curious.
@_date: 2019-09-03 16:29:34
I'll bite. How did you make $5M off of bitcoin and not pay a dime in taxes.
@_date: 2018-07-30 06:01:33
Didja know he has a nice farm in southern Ohio? Unrelated. I just like Dave.

Many people would love the opportunity to mine bitcoin. Ban it and all you do is drive mining underground.
