I agree with the majority of what you said, but there is only libertarian and right-libertarian (American). Libertarianism is inherently left wing thus does not need the left noted. The new American libertarian (right) is the new branch of the tree.

I'm supposed to respect the property rights of millionaire and billionaire conglomerates who shaped the world around me before I was even born, not even giving me a chance to have a hand in what I am and will be exposed to? The whole world is literally shaped by special interests to put their message into my mind, if you live in a city. But if I put up a message, I get fined or arrested because I didnt pay for it, or wasn't lucky enough to be born in the past to gain that kind of control over what's considered public domain.Am I supposed to respect the property rights of an individual who claims a large portion of land which stops me from travelling through it, being born on it, growing food on it, building a shelter to survive etc...

I thought American libertarians believed in strict property rights and enforcement of these rights? 
As an anarchist I can give two shits about it so I am down to do some flyposting, but isn't it some cognitive dissonance for America libertarians to do something like this?
@_date: 2014-11-15 17:52:34
It can go from "left" leaning anarchism all the way to the "right" of it into libertarian, if we were forced to put it into some dichotomous scale.
It is a technology which helps people bypass the middlemen who have forced themselves in positions of power today to gain billions, if not trillions, on the expense of the poor. The banks. Because of this, it will attract the radical thinkers first, slowly pulling on those willing to think outside of the box. 
Your last question is pretty interesting. I guess there should be a subreddit set up for those in favour of state power? How quickly will that subreddit be appropriated?
But to just label the project as being libertarian is narrowing the lens. There is a broad spectrum of ideology ranging from libertarian socialism to American libertarian (capitalists). Then there are the fringes beyond those points.
@_date: 2014-02-23 01:19:57
Its more than just government. The whole American political spectrum is skewed to the right of center. Democrats are right leaning and that pushes their opponents even more to the right. There has been a large psychological campaign in the US praising the form of capitalism which is benefiting the upper class, they like to look at themselves as the oppressed and burdened by government when their hands dip into the control panel of the government at whim. The state and capitalism work hand in hand symbiotically and will co-opt real organic movements in a heart beat to survive.

If there is truth to that statement then sure go ahead and store it on coinbase. Tbh I believe many people, if not the majority, will be storing their coins on a web wallet. It is just the way we have conditioned ourselves to store information online, to trust in bigger institutions. There are risks for both. Whatever seems like the less risky should be your route to take. I dont think everyone should be forced to store them on their own, it will just be no ones fault but the user if they were to be lost.

No they are not. It is the media and people who are trying to delegitimize the movement by making them seem clueless and broken when the whole movement was decentralized and anarchists were the ones to instigate and spark the movement. This poster is making a mockery of the stupidity of having a single demand. It was co-opted by Starbuck drinking liberals, but you must remember how important decentralization is and how you cannot centralize these movements aswell.

You don't have to instinctively hit the downvote button because you don't agree, reddiquette.American libertarians advocate a cult like following to laissez-faire capitalism and to the ownership of resources, land and vast amounts of property. Outside of the US libertarians are anarchistic in their views on property rights and anti-capitalism. There is a a stark difference between American libertarians because it has an American conservative injection, similar to anti-state neo-liberalism.

I've had this thought as well. If only you held your private keys, how can a nation State use the funds to further the military industrial complex. Ofcourse they do this through taxation, but in a cryptocurrency only world it would be amazing to be able to offer my taxation to institutions I personally back. Such as the healthcare, education etc. If I do not support the military or its uses, why should I be forced to fund its actions. 
This may be the main resistance factor to full acceptance. nation states will not accept a currency if that nation state can only exist through military force... Ie.. The US. 
@_date: 2014-02-23 00:26:00
Exactly, this is why American based ideologies should be kept out of the sidebar. Libertarianism started out, and still is, as a radical socialist philosophy, but as usually many "right" conservatives from the US appropriated the word along with anarchism, bastardizing it into anarcho-capitalism.  Why do these American centric terms need to be in the side bar?  
@_date: 2014-09-13 15:18:36
Is this American Libertarian or the libertarian the rest of the world tends to follow. If its American, then I'm out, no time and patience to live with conservatives.

I don't think he died on the cross. That was taken from an ancient pagan myth and incorporated into christianity to control people into an old tale going back thousands of years. Jesus actually just was unconscious, woke up later on, left and went east like he was supposed to. There are groups of people going east from the middle east all the way to japan with jewish roots, there is a tomb of jesus in kashmir, India. A tomb with footprints of the man buried there and it has markings under his foot. The people there are genetically from the middle east and they care for the tomb. They don't use the name "Jesus" as that name was given to him later. They use his hebrew name. Jesus died like any other human did.

I find that the majority of "anarcho"-capitalists and American libertarians are 90+% male. This has its implications in different regions. Outside the US libertarians are mostly left leaning and have more female participation in its social sphere. It could be just the local ideology in the region that has accepted bitcoin. In a male dominated society where men dictate economic policies and control, you'll find more men. In more egalitarian locales you'll find the opposite.

Capitalism and government work in sync. The state protects private property rights of capitalists who then influence the state to continue its enforcement of capitalist protection. The reason many states are iffy about bitcoin is so it does not destabalize the power held by the current capitalist structure. Once they see benefit of maintaining power in the hands of a few, which capitalism propagates, then it will be considered to allow bitcoins. As long as capital gets funneled into the hands of capitalists, they dont care if we use bitcoins, or seashells.

It is inevitable for the time being. There is the traditional paradigm everyone was used to. The traditional system felt as though it was apart of nature, which allowed economists and the laymen alike to say things like, "survival of the fittest" "hierarchy is needed" "capitalism is good" etc. The internet is blowing the doors and minds open to alternative ways of thinking and not so much in a western eurocentric oppressive thought pattern. Short term quick buck by any means even if it means toppling my neighbor, is not a universal trait in humanity, only in those brought up in a system that rewarded these behaviours. There will be people who will move into new ways of thinking/systems with the old traits and try to reuse them. After graduating highschool i came upon libertarianism. Then it turned me the fuck off after realizing it is saturated with middle-upper class white males in america. I followed the trail and libertarianism led me to its international roots in socialism and then anarchism where its important to comprehend that no system or ideology is universal. Everything is permitted to be questioned and nothing is pure and true.

Awesome idea. Thinking about the possibilities of bitcoin and condensing it all into point form is challenging but fun :)
* Bitcoin manifests as digital currency in a world powered by the internet and its users. Borderless, fluid and free.
* Billions of unbanked people on the planet, and people tired of centralized power in economics, can be their own bank and pull the power back to themselves where it belongs.
* Bitcoin works on top of the blockchain, a public ledger powered by millions of users insuring security on a level never fathomed before. 
* Being decentralized allows bitcoin to bypass middlemen and hands that have been reaching into your pocket for millennia, saving you time by being close to instantaneous and saving money by being direct between parties.
* The underlying system is completely open source and free to be scrutinized, being 100% transparent allows for the most fair economic balanced peer to peer system to date. 
* Bitcoin can be stored in multiple ways depending on the user's personal choice. Cold storage for maximum security, computer wallets for maintenance and occasional use, and web wallets for instant transactions while still maintaining security.
* Bitcoin allows the public to learn and think about alternative ways of thinking and living. Having been stuck in an old system of control, the knowledge of bitcoin alone allows for the opportunity and potential of new systems based on decentralized relationships and systems.

Good point. During India's struggle against the british, it was more than one unified group and ideology reaching for revolution. The education system here in the western world, atleast, tells us that Gandhi was the major, and only, component in the struggle against the British. Where as Bhagat Singh, took direct action and was more supported by the populous than Gandhi. Bhagat Singh led raids on british convoys, used a grenade in the british legislative assembly to purposely get arrested to bring huge awareness to their cause. They planned not to hurt anyone with the grenade.
He is more celebrated for India's independence than Gandhi is. It was a multi-dimensional revolution. 


In the US, there was Malcolm X and his direct approach in confronting power and the elite class along the side of MLK who used a different approach. 
This explains why the established media conglomerates focused so heavily on Occupy's many varying struggles. They pointed it out as though it is a weakness, when it is the decentralization that will eventually surge bigger the next round of civil unrest in whatever form it takes.

I would say it is the shared view of a no state system in anarchism and a highly reduced state power in a libertarian system that binds these ideologies close together. Libertarians still want to include some centralized power to uphold claims of property rights and markets, where as anarchists neglect state power all together.
Also, I didn't mean the extreme right, just the "right" of anarchism which would be Libertarianism. It is still a narrow band on the political spectrum.

You cant be an anti-capitalist and the US president of course.

Isn't it the other way around. The collapse of capitalism leads to communism that leads to decentralized socialism. 
@_date: 2015-05-03 20:08:08
It basically comes down to the belief that owning land as private property is anachronistic. When it actually extends rule over another which goes against anarchism's core tenant of rejecting illegitimate authority. Land ownership takes the rights of others from walking on the land, growing food on the land or even being born on the land away. It becomes more like a decentralized feudal system. Anarcho-capitalists are just capitalists, the anarcho becomes an oxymoron next to capitalism. Rothbard himself concluded that anarcho-capitalists are not anarchists and separated from the term.

It doesn't make it easier for nation states to be pushing for direct military conflict if they dont have the resources to do it anymore.

With bitcoin we can have direct control over where our money is spent. People always spout that we could change the world by choosing who to give our money too. Well that was pretty much impossible until Bitcoin and the like takes over. With the old system our taxes go to fund wars and subsidize the ultra rich. We fall into the psychologically manipulative culture of consumerism specifically mechanized by the marketing industry to control our behaviours. It's a trillion dollar industry.
But now we have this. When we hear of some scientists or group of people studying and developing, doing research on ideas that can truly push humanity forward, we can now have a DIRECT path and impact on its push into the consciousness of others. There is so much tied behind bitcoin and its application of decentralization of power. 
Thanks for bringing this up. We should have a subreddit dedicated to funding BitcoinScience! 
@_date: 2013-12-09 05:27:41
Exactly, bitcoin represents the power of withholding funds directly into the hands of the people. In the system we live in now, nation states hand over blank cheques to their militaries, and then we all as the people wonder why there are wars and conflict? Bitcoin allows us to invest in directly what the people want. We can withhold this funding to military-corporate controlled industries, crippling them. Instead spread bitcoins in endeavors the people individually or commonly decide to expand. People want a better education system, space program independent from nationalistic desires and mliitary? Better health care system? well Bitcoin gives the phrase "put your money where your mouth is" real meaning. It isn't pulled from us to fund the most shady industries in the world. We can decide which industries evolve and die.

Islam is not a centralized organization following the orders of an entity. If there is show me who is controlling over 1.5 billion people. 


Hilarious. It is governments who hold power in the region. These governments are influenced by what all governments are now interested in. Money and power. That is what is controlling the region. Throw in a great destabilizing force externally, and you will create a clusterfuck where an external force can move in and gather the power hegemony in the region. The people in the region are fighting over geopolitical resources and tension, like they have been doing and the globe has been doing for millennia, before and after the advent of Islam.

The US regime overthrew/overthrows dozens upon dozens of democratically elected governments throughout the world, across south america, to the africas, across the middle east all the way to eastern asia. The US funds, trains, and educates dictators and their paramilitaries on how to supress populations, control the media, and disappear dissidents. Remember 9/11/ Not 2001 but in 1973 when the US was involved in the overthrowing of chile. They then shipped them weapons and trained the dictator in the "School of Americas" teaching neo-liberal capitalism to implement in chile. This happens every year in some part of the globe.

You're so right. The early adopters were the smart/foolish ones to put their, I don't want to say faith, knowledge into this system when it needed it. I feel as though it is a part of the design of bitcoin to attract a very specific demographic in its early days. I just got out of highschool in 2007, so when I heard about bitcoins on digg back in 09ish, I wanted to get involved, but I couldn't afford any sort of rig or system to help myself. My goal is to start a business that works only in the bitcoin infrastructure. Any fiat is just moving through, and to pay myself and others only in btc. It is moving along and hopefully next year will get itself going. 
Thanks so much for this. It just keeps motivating me more and more. The only 5btc I had and acquired only this past month was taken away in a scam, partnered with my own stupidity, and I chose not to allow it to grief me more than a couple days. The whole concept and values inherit in the bitcoin system has so much potential wrapped up in its code and users, and I feel as though it is lubricating my inner thoughts on many levels. It must be more than just a form of exchange of currency. You and others prove that to me. I can't wait to see where it leads into the future.

Look, you are trying to defend a nation state against accusations of performing direct acts of terrorism. It is proven time and time again that the US is involved with and has fulfilled every component an entity needs to be declared a terrorist. You never counter those points. You go on to defend by painting a binary picture. US vs North Korea. White vs Black. Good vs Evil. 
If you want to defend the US against accusations of being the largest terrorist organization in the world, then you need to start countering clear examples. And not doing what you say we are doing, comparing apples and oranges.

There is no such thing as a "muslim government" in this world yet. 


Nowhere in Islam does it say or express thoughts of fighting over resources as you claim. Can you prove this?


What is propping up these governments and influences of power in the region? You cannot prove it is religion that is pushing economic warfare throughout the region. It is the economic climate itself that is destabilizing the region as nation states battle each other for scraps post-colonialism. What we are seeing is the result of neo-colonialism, where the globalization of an economic system is wreaking havoc in the region. It has happened and is happening in south america, the africas and all across asia. Groups are forming to counter this throughout the globe in left wing blocs. There is a severe threat to the world when one nation, the US, is taking their ideology directly into the borders of others, through force and economic sanctions. 
You mentioned 9/11 in another comment, thinking that somehow this was the beginning and tipping point of conflict. History and anyone knowledgeable in basic history understands it goes further back in time than 2001. That is a whole history lesson you need to read upon. The world isn't as black and white as you think it is. But just to tell you, 9/11 was not a religious attack. The so called perpetrators said themselves it is because of western involvement in geopolitical affairs of other nations...
