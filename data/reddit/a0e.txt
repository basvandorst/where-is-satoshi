You can.  There is a finite number of words used.

Anyway, try

I love how it reads as if someone was replying to himself just for thread traffic...��

I'm also interested in running a capacity LN node on my existing full bitcoind.   I, so far, haven't found any documentation on how to set this up.
@_date: 2018-01-04 12:50:16
Curious though, aren't you going to be hit with short-term taxes (20%) on gains for all the small purchases come April 15th?  So you're getting income tax, sending to coinbase, paying for something with sales tax, then taking another hit filing taxes with capital gains?
@_date: 2018-01-19 04:44:15
Pretty sure this is it
@_date: 2018-01-20 05:44:30
Any luck?   
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:38:46
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:11:31
But at some point you can claim you did 1M worth of drugs.
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:07:31
Capital gains.   There's a site somewhere listing out that information.   Maybe sidebar?
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:49:47
Can confirm.   My old zeroed account was recoverable.
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:22:56
Don't tell them amounts.  Don't give them access to wallet or PC
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:36:47
@_date: 2017-12-02 05:44:02
How do you claim these purchases with respect to taxes?   
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:04:22
Do not tell anyone.
1.  Trezor.  
2. Get setup on coinbase
3.  Sell in '18 so you can postpone taxes till '19.   Be prepared for 15-20% hit
4.  Don't send all the coins to coinbase are once, do a few at a time.  They're likely to ask where you acquired them.  Don't risk getting them all "locked up"
Don't tell anyone.
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:45:56
No clue... You should move anything there to a new wallet.   Mycelium on Android or if hodling long term, buy a trezor
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:30:32
Ask him if "Mt GOX" rings any bells...
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:12:25
A coin?  By when?
@_date: 2018-05-30 03:35:50
Don't.  It's the same as buying clean coins.
@_date: 2017-08-15 04:20:53
Lol, I'm not feeling shitty.   I've been around since late '10 too... 
@_date: 2017-08-16 02:01:02
Um.   The fee is optional and if you have no urgency then just wait for the miners to pick it up. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 04:13:27
Just shows you're all talk and dreaming big.
@_date: 2017-08-15 03:56:42
No one particular, but your making big boasts with no evidence.   A simple fix with a signed note from your "rich" wallet.
@_date: 2017-08-15 03:46:21
Sign something from a wallet with proof.
@_date: 2017-11-26 01:29:50
Mycelium can then show details and receiving addresses without trezor as it's only needed for signing transaction.
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:23:29
Careful.   Once updating one trezor of mine, it derped and I had to reinitialize with seed words.
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:49:39
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:23:09
But I use tails...and trezor
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:44:32
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:28:57
You could try an otg connector with Mycelium on Android.
@_date: 2017-11-26 01:22:09
Works with otg cable on phone with mycellium
@_date: 2017-11-20 03:16:47
Fraud.    Chargebacks are allowed... They'll end up with your coin and their cash.
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:22:20
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:27:34
Of course, just send from mycelium to trezor address.   Choose the lowest fee too and just wait, I'll eventually confirm.
@_date: 2018-02-17 04:20:57
Sentinel, by same people.   Scan the xpub (or similar).
@_date: 2018-02-17 04:22:38
Well for deposits...
@_date: 2017-07-17 03:44:35
This occurred just as coinbase offered it (which is the employer of the litecoin author).
