An estimate of something as specific as 12:05 is just a flat out lie though, there might not even be a block that HOUR, let alone that minute, let alone any guarantee that that transaction or ANY transaction will be mined in that block.

I think you might think that because maybe that would have been a good way to design a thing, but poor design means that actually if there was lots and lots of nodes, things would actually get very slightly slower, as propagation took more and more jumps to find a miner but would basically stay the same speed.

Yeah, when people talk about bitcoin having a known issuance rate that is pretty much bunk. The number of tokens is vaugely estimatable but no one can say if a year from now 5 dollars or 500 dollars or 5 million dollars worth of bitcoin are going to be minted so the static number is pretty meaningless.

In what way is it "immutable"? Data in both the bitcoin and in other altcoin chains have been changed.

Bitcoin transactions are mutable as anything.

At least on this forum it seems very obvious that the concerns and needs of the people trying to be "saved" rarely have little concern for them and is at best driven by some poor quality math that people have cooked up that they think that by spreading bitcoin in africa they will be able to extract money from them.
It's always unclear to me if the companies that try to spread bitcoin to africa have even ever been to africa or even talked to any africans at all. They all seem solely based on looking at the price on western union and saying "we can do that" and not understanding or even asking what services the actual people want or use already.

At least one transaction is gone. The one giving some guy 184 billion bitcoin. Also no, there is absolutely no guarantee that every transaction mined in all 50 blocks got reminded. Maybe they did and maybe they didn't and there is no way to see a clear record of it.

There is no reason to raise fees as blocks get more full, it's binary between full or not full. 
If the block is 10% or 75% full it should be the same: every transaction should get in. Right up to 99% full.
The second it gets 100% full and one more transaction comes in then someone has to be kicked, but there is no reason to kick any transactions if there is still room in a block.

Non-mining nodes aren't really a thing satoshi designed bitcoin around. He thought bitcoin was going to be far more p2p than it turned out to be. Miners communicate to eachother through the relay network, custodial wallets all submit transactions directly to miners. Relay nodes are a weird side thing that doesn't do much in the network except act as a slow middleman.
However the importance of nodes gets inflated more and more as it's the only way to pretend bitcoin is decentralized and that normal users have any interaction with it. It's bread and circuses to make people feel better now that bitcoin has 5 miners and is a centralized thing. They don't do anything and are barely used by anything on the network at all. 
@_date: 2016-02-03 22:53:22

Bitcoin was far more secure when there was more than 5 miners. It doesn't matter how many hashes those five pools do if it still stays five. 
The fact two pools have stayed at almost exactly 25% each and never deviated more than 3 percentage points despite the rapid and massive growth makes it also pretty clear that 50% of the network is collaborating heavily to pretend to have less than half by distributing it to two pools.

In current practice coins that never get mined eventually get lost from the mempool and are "returned".

Pretty much. They don't really DO that much in the protocol. miners communicate directly through bluematt's relay network, wallets and exchanges submit transactions directly to miners. Relay nodes just kinda sit there. you can say they work as a backup system and maybe that is true? But if virtually all the nodes went way little would change. miners could still mine and use the relay network, wallets and exchanges could still make transactions submitted to miners. Nothing much would be different. But they make bitcoin feel better because they ape p2p 
And that isn't just my opinion, gavin anderson and several other devs echo that with statements such as:
"Why do we need transaction relayers? What vital function do they provide?"

The blockchain isn't immutable, in many alt coins using the same coinbase certain transactions have been removed after large thefts, in bitcoin 50 entire blocks were dropped to reset things after a serious early glitch. 
nothing is magical about the blockchain that makes it unchangable, It doesn't even inherently leave a record of changes when changes ARE made, making it worse than some standard database systems, the 50 blocks that are gone are just gone gone and you can only read about them in a wiki or something, the structure doesn't store them for historical purposes to see what was changed at all.

What does that even mean? 
Why would anyone outside nutcase bitcoiners think this is a good thing to say? 
Like I get that government can't shut down "bitcoin" as a network very easily but if you flat out admit it's some weird plan to hurt the US and anyone anywhere is dumb enough to actually believe that is plausible they can sure as shit shut down all legitimate use of bitcoin and kill every bitcoin business that runs in the US.

Visa was able to increase it's max transaction limit from 56,000 to 65,000+ in the past year, bitcoin is tearing itself to shreads fighting over moving it from 2.8 to maybe 5.6 tps maybe before 2018. 
Banks absolutely are already far more nimble than bitcoin ever will be. Centralized stuff almost always is.

He was using "bitcoin" as a joke thing that most readers would understand because they also think of bitcoin as a joke. But the bitcoin community isn't used to thinking of bitcoin as anything but very serious and doesn't understand the connotation it has to most people. 
@_date: 2016-02-16 14:30:29
Not simply "there are alt coins with different limits", but that alt coins, running bitcoin's software have changed their limit in flight. Showing conclusively that it is not a technical hurdle. 
You are correct that it is still a steep political hill to climb and unlikely to happen soon, but some people think it's cryptographically protected or governed by math or something. It's just a thing people pick, not protected by anything special.

Technically you have to raise the fee every time you resend the transaction. However the minimum fee is many thousands of satoshis so you can start at zero and increment it one at a time and fail to hit "infinite" but still clog the memepool with at least many thousands of copies of each transaction. 
@_date: 2016-02-10 20:06:22
I'm glad we have moved from the statist fiat prison of knowing in advance how much fees will be.

Bitcoin is pretty doomed if it requires printing 10,000 dollars  worth of bitcoin every ten minutes plus 4 cents per transaction and it still can barely handle 3 transactions per second.

Bitcoin seems to only spawn companies and users in countries with very strong economies, the node count is pretty much in order by economic strength and no poorer economy has seen any adoption of bitcoin so I really have no idea why the doomsday circlejerk is always so strong with bitcoin people, weak economies seem to have done nothing good for an internet currency. 
@_date: 2016-02-04 12:16:24
It's the tragedy of the commons, the whole bitcoin network is based on people like you donating resources but there will never be a time where what you donate is enough, so in the long term just expect all resources you offer to be taken by someone for something.

Do you think ACH couldn't handle things in 3 hours if they were only processing 250,000 transactions a day? Banks have at least 250,000 employees, they could hand deliver the transactions at that volume. 
@_date: 2016-02-05 02:51:09
Yeah, but it's not "40x faster", it's just processing less. Like of course you can finish a job faster when you are doing a far smaller job. Pit them one to one and bitcoin will take hundreds of years to complete the same work.

who cares? Bitcoin could run on a calculator or a supercomputer and the capacity is the same. All more processing does is waste more resources.
@_date: 2016-02-08 20:10:46
It did because it let the mining centralize in a way that they could not have operated if the network was P2P

I don't even get it. Would bitcoin people like it better if money was government run? If the US just has a private currency not controlled by the government isn't that better? 
Or does it go back and forth depending which benifits bitcoin to say at any given moment?
@_date: 2016-02-16 17:26:25
Yeah, you got it, and that is why there is a lot of scams in the bitcoin world.  People will throw out a bunch of fluff about how multisig and escrow helps by adding a third person you need to trust but your question is the exact reason bitcoin scams are so extremely common. 
Although the most common scams are people scamming users out of money instead of out of shoes.

Most altcoins run nearly identical source code to bitcoin, giving a real world demonstration that the source code of bitcoin does not prevent alteration of that limit. It can happen and has happened to coins running the same programming. 
@_date: 2016-02-29 19:58:28
I absolutely guarantee that it'd take more than one transaction for you to figure out someone pasted a new code over yours while their partner distracted. I bet you'd even end up sending some of your own money trying to figure out "what the hell is happening with this stupid broken thing, why are people yelling at me about how they are sure the transaction went through even though I am not seeing any transactions" 
@_date: 2016-02-11 15:40:22
It could, it's why a lot of people are very sad bitcoin left it's p2p nature behind and is now just client/server with a few servers to pick from all running on bluematt's  centralized relay network.

@_date: 2016-02-04 16:27:29
me personally not being to change it seems like a big shifting of goal posts from it never being changeable. Both coins running the same code as bitcoin and bitcoin itself have had the blockchain altered when needed. Normally quite reasonably, but it's absolutely not "immutable" and doesn't even keep a good record of what has been changed when things ARE changed.

How long does it take bitcoin to process 22 billion transactions? 
At 250,000 transaction per day bitcoin would process that in about 241 YEARS. Assuming no one ever made any more transactions and just politely waited for it to finish. ACH is so much faster than bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-02-04 17:58:32
22 billion / 365 / 24 / 60 / 60 = 697 transactions per average second (and that is average, not max). 
So yeah, bitcoin isn't even close.

It's hard to say bitcoin in it's current state is "peer to peer". 
That was true in the early days but now it's client and server. With the servers being somewhat distributed and there being a relay network in between. 
This isn't really bad, but don't say bitcoin is "peer to peer" when that is not the topology it uses anymore.
