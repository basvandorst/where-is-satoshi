But if we listen to him and keep our own money, how will the government be able to squander it on 1billion dollar jets for bombing brown people in developing nations? This guy is an asshole.

Ive thought about this too, butter us up with gains, get everyone used to it, crash it with futures, manipulate it till no one cares anymore than transfer fiat to the blockchain for total control. Maybe no one knows who Satoshi is, bc the NSA want it that way. I’m not saying this is it for sure, but the thought has crossed my mind, too. It’s not inconceivable.

Do you know why gold investors dont all drive Lambos? Because the price doesnt move that much. I mean,  gold doesnt have an ROI of 6000 percent, or whatever btc is at today,  in the last 6 years. Thats because its had downward price pressure since forever. Its a manipulated market with active shorters. Thats what btc is now- digital gold.  Complete with the new ability to crash the price at will, which didnt exist for the majority of the chart you just posted ( specifically the wildly profitable years), so when someone talks about how bitcoin is the greatest investment of our generation. I dont argue, because it was. However!  since CME and the others came along, its lost money. That is just the facts. I dont like it any more than you do. Will the price exponentially rise again? Maybe, no one knows, but it would be delusional to not take into account the one CRUCIAL difference between pre 12/10/17 and post thats all.
Ps i did not post this for you, this paragraph was just luck.

Better sell all our bitcoin guys- it’s dangerous.

The price patterns from the past are meaningless, because there was no future trading back then. Everything is different now.
