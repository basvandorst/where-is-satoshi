Yeah, the first person I talked too didn't know what they were &amp; there was a super long pause while she talked to someone. Then after she explained it, she offered to get her supervisor (I didn't even ask for the supervisor) to explain a bit more. The supervisor seemed pretty reactionary -- like all she knew what that it was "bad" and they didn't want any part of it.

Done. Did it :)

Woah, that's kind of awesome. I got an account with Schwab for bitcoin stuffs, but I'm going to keep USAA as my primary bank, there's just too many good things about them.

Okay, I'm actually doing this. I'm going to switch to Schwab woohoo! Not too worried about the login security issue. If you can point me to an article where someone's account was hacked I may change my mind.

Yeah that's what I'm thinking now -- switching banks. The problem is USAA is such an awesome bank, I don't want to leave. I heard Charles Schwabb has good checking accounts ... Fantasy: "I'd like to close all my accounts please." "And why have we lost your business?" "Because of your policy regarding bitcoin." Yay fantasy.
*edit: anyone who has successfully wired to btc-e, what bank did you use?

Yes, but maybe I didn't add enough. I'm testing out the same thing with a whole bitcoin now -- using a password protected wallet generated with bitaddress.org. Will let you peeps know how it goes ...

That's true. But I'd find out when trying to sell, which would be a bummer if I REALLY wanted to sell then b/c it would take a little while to verify another bank. Oh wait. I should just open another account or two just in case &amp; pre-verify them just in case. I also just noticed that you can just enter your billing address with coinbase. I guess they just send you a check then?

I've always loved USAA -- this is the only "problem" I've ever had with them.
@_date: 2013-11-25 17:08:18
I'm more worried that they would stop accepting transfers FROM Coinbase. How would I sell any coins then?
Edit* I know I could try to do it locally, but without some direct line to a usd bank account, this starts to get yucky.

Solid advice here. Thanks. Spending too much time on btc-e etc makes you forget how shady some of this stuff actually might be. I'm here because I think crypto is an incredible invention &amp; believe in it -- but I'm not super willing to sacrifice my credibility in the name of it ... yet.

It did. It said something like "the bitcoin network requires this, it doesn't go to coinbase." And it was a .0001 fee I think, not a .0002 fee. Mistype.
