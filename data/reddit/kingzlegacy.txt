Even in France there are talks of outlawing encryption following the attack on the media outlet which made a comic disrespecting Mohammed. As far as I'm concerned we're all in the same boat, I'm sure the the 5 eyes has ways of tapping any country's citizens.

30/10/unlimited in Canada, and that's moderate.

911 was an inside job. Research building 7 and how it collapsed with nothing but a fire in the building. Or how thermite leaves pools of molten metal for weeks after.

Exactly, the government collects next to no data regarding terrorists this way, they aren't retarded enough to plan on Facebook. This is for the government to spy on its citizens, you know cause America hasn't been looking more and more like a police state (sarcasm).

Aviation fuel vs structural steel as well as reinforced concrete, not much of an argument

Hijack it is not, because if a majority agrees on the change to classic, then it's not a hijacking, it's consensus.

Americans are the terrorists. Statistically more Americans die from car accidents and disease overseas, than from terrorism. Meanwhile Americans are responsible for tens of thousands of deaths each year in foreign countries.

Maidsafe was not mentioned on that list. It is similar to cryptocurrencies yet much more if it achieves what has been publicized.

 and that is just in Iraq. The US has been in war more that it has not since it's founding. That includes war with itself.

Would you prefer a more american response and him say a drone strike?

You mean like the core devs working for BS? No that's not conflict of interest /s

You just have us your description, I will find you now.

Very nice defense. Get educated and stop being a slave to the system. We'd be better off without you.

Or he could have said, "demo the buildings and blame terrorists." The American Way.

Maidsafe looks promising.

Along with venture capital, which usually isn't handed out without expectation of ROI. 
How does blockstream benefit from providing what bitcoin is currently lacking (due to devs who work for blockstream not accommodating the demand and need)? Looks a little too much like conflict of interest.
@_date: 2016-01-15 15:22:09
Not sure which rock you've been under but everybody and their moms want bigger blocks to accommodate more txs/s. I personally don't want to HAVE to use blockstreams altcoin so that I buy shit with my bitcoin, it is completely possible with bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-15 15:12:05
The success of blockstream does depend on bitcoin, but it also depends on the current shortcomings of bitcoin, mainly being blocksize. Either way bitcoin will be here and as a result blockstream as well, but blockstream benefits a hell of a lot more when the network capacity is dependant solely on their LN.

If you actually thought and did research for yourself and weren't a sheep, you would realize that the pool that mined it supports segwit2x.

I would like the future of bitcoin to be in a variety of hands, not just blockstreams as well. Having developer centralization is more worrisome that mining centralization tbf.
@_date: 2015-04-03 02:58:49
Funny how there's no mention of it being decentralized though. I guess they figure it's better not to spread the word about that. Fail if I've seen one.

The government is always stealing your money through inflation and taxes, and that shit is the new norm.

Very awesome, love the ingenuity.

Don't let the price get to you, things take time to grow, especially when it disrupts current systems. Change is only slowed when media outlets are spewing propaganda to the public, but when people start seeing banks as they truly are, a corrupt institution looking out for the best interest of the top 1%, then people will drop the shackles and step into the future.

Before I got verified on my current exchange I was using virwox to buy bitcoins but their fees are quite expensive tbh, that's why I started using an exchange.
@_date: 2015-03-25 18:34:13
By saying the guy deserves to lose his coins is being a dick the last I checked. If someone is uneducated about any aspect of bitcoin, how the fuck are you going to attack the guy. All you fuck tards need to grow up. Offer insight and educate people who are not aware, or just stfu and read not reply.
@_date: 2015-03-05 09:03:44
I've used virwox for most of my BTC purchases (not that I prefer it), I have always received my BTC although I've had to wait 12+ hours, but that was upon starting the account the same day and it being the first transaction I was fine with it. The fees are stupid though as others have pointed out, you're better off using localbitcoins though, as you'll get better value for your fiat and it adds to the anonymity of your purchase which is another W. 
@_date: 2015-03-06 22:32:34
I see bitcoin as a disruption to banks in a way that doesn't effect westerners so much in the beginning. But it disrupts how the banks own other developing countries where their currency hyper inflates annually, people are abused by banks that we over here do not get to see or do not know. For us it is a means of revolution, to destroy this corrupt thing as we know, but for others, it's a means of being on an fair plane with every other human being on earth, not biased by borders, government or what have you.

Living in America it is illegal not to pay for their acts of terrorism. Not saying it's right, but America has cut off many many many many heads. Just expressing the similarities between the two.

Convenience is the issue here, people don't want the extra hassle with securing their coins, and people don't want to learn how to setup a wallet. I see promise with hardware wallets such as ledger wallet blue because it both secures and adds the convenience of a debit card, whilst being the size of one. Even with things like trezor and the current ledger wallet, they're more like vaults or safes, but with the convenience and familiarities of a card, even merchants could adapt quite easily via NFC.
@_date: 2015-03-05 22:32:58
I agree with you about America being a police state and all, including the chances of being killed by police being many times greater.... But it in no way makes supporting a group of religious fuck nuts any better.

Is it anymore ridiculous than almost all current religions?
