People join projects for all kinds of reasons. There is a big money incentive for such people to join blockchain projects so they do it. It does not necessarily means they believe in that project or that SEC approval is around the corner because some old big shot joined another project.

Alt coins were bringing higher returns at that time.
@_date: 2018-08-05 14:51:34
It’s not about saving to buy one bitcoin. It’s about prioritizing investing into higher return alt coins. Now that I feel that bitcoin is still going to get a correction I’m not goin to be putting a big chunk of money into any coin including bitcoin. Bitcoin has a big potential in a long run and I just want to own a whole 1 BTC for a long term investment.
@_date: 2018-08-04 19:29:50
I didn’t have that much capital for a risky investment last year... I bought into ETH and few smaller altcoins.

It might be too late then. I am definitely buying one bitcoin at $5k. 
@_date: 2018-08-05 13:20:37
I think the statement is clear. I did not have enough money to spread it around in risky investment to the point where I could afford a full bitcoin and alt coins which were bringing higher returns. While I wanted to own a full bitcoin it was not making sense at that time where bitcoin was poised for few times returns and alt coins up to 100 times. Now that I do have more cash I would buy a bitcoin if it was to hit serious correction.

You are only proving my point. Did you even read Bernie’s policies? Do they remind you of those in Venezuela or in the Nordic model? Sure you Trumpers want to paint Bernie with the Stalin, Mao and Muslini communism/socialism brush but you are misrepresenting him completely. So I ask again, you should read more about the Nordic model itself and Bernie’s policies so you could stop saying dumb shit.
“The Nordic model is a term coined to capture the unique combination of free market capitalism and social benefits that have given rise to a society that enjoys a host of top-quality services, including free education and free healthcare, as well as generous, guaranteed pension payments for retirees. These benefits are funded by taxpayers and administered by the government for the benefit of all citizens. The citizens have a high degree of trust in their government and a history of working together to reach compromises and address societal challenges through democratic processes. Their policy makers have chosen a mixed economic system that reduces the gap between the rich and the poor through redistributive taxation and a robust public sector while preserving the benefits of capitalism.”
“Sanders described himself as a "democratic socialist"[5] and an admirer of aspects of social democracy as practiced in the Scandinavian countries. “
In his own words:
“When I talk about democratic socialism, I’m not looking at Venezuela. I’m not looking at Cuba. I’m looking at countries like Denmark and Sweden.” Bernie Sanders

It's funny to me how hard you try and pin me as a "pseudoscientist" in opposition to your "science," the same way that fool hawkings is an "atheist" again "theists." " - Unsupported hypothesis or theory is nothing but pseudoscience in cases where people trying to push these personal ideas try to claim it as "truths". If such people cannot provide supporting evidence for these claims the have failed to reach the level of scientific support for their personal opinions. Not sure why you are rambling about Hawkins and seem to imply that Hawkins is a like "theist" mind because he is not open to unsupported claims. Well fucking DUH. If you make a claim and your claim does not meet the burden of proof the only right thing to do in this case is to dismiss such claim. You and your pseudoscience writers have been asked multiple time to submit their claims with their so called "evidence" for rigorous testing and every time they submit it it fails, and the times when they don't submit it for testing is because they don't want to be exposed as charlatans. Google James Randi challenge and find out for yourself how many of these charlatans failed or are afraid to be exposed.
"It's this divisive, compartmentalized thinking that is the problem." - no.. It's the people like you who think that every opinion is valid and that claims don't require supporting evidence in order to call them truths. There is a reason why in America people are innocent until proven guilty. The person making a claim needs to meet the burden of proof. They need to present the evidence for their claim. Your pseudoscience writers have been unable to do so every time they are asked to present such evidence. You want to claim otherwise? Give me the claim and then show me how was is it supported by evidence. I will with an open mind look into it and see is there anything actually valid in that claim. 
 "I'm not sure why you're demanding that I go and look through your scientific journals, that's sounds boring." - Exactly, science is hard and for most people it looks like a boring process. It's easier to just believe in claims and not have to work through proofs for those claims. It's easy to just believe in shit because it makes you happy or it reflects your personal opinions no matter how ignorant and false they are. Real science is hard, bullshit claims are easy.
"I don't recommend that you meditate, cause that's a waste of my time. I'm done here, be well bye bye" - Meditation(especially mindfulness) actually has some possible benefits to humans, but it's not those exaggerated benefits many hardcore supporters of medication tend to claim such as curing cancer and so as such claims have not been shown to be supported by any scientific testing.
I suggest you open your mind to the idea that many claims on the internet are mostly false. Become a skeptic first and accept only claim that have been verified to be true. Think about who tells you what and what credentials do they have. Claim made by one person even with credentials might not be true so therefore see if other experts in those fields agree with the findings. Have they made the same independent studies and reached those conclusions? Don't just blindly accept claims by fiction writers or by people who have anecdotal evidence. I ate some avocados and my cancer was cured. Yeah... ok... bullshit...

You do realize that majority of believers(Christians and Muslims) actually believe in that type of God with the beard type of version of the God. This is why he addressed the most common version of a God people believe in. The type of personal God who supposedly listens to their prayers, watches over them daily, finds their keys, gives them jobs, wins lottery tickets for them and so on. This is the personal God most people believe in and for that type of God Hawkins addressed it perfectly. There not only is no reason to believe such god exists but we also have evidence that disproves such an idea that such god exists. So no, his understanding is not childish, it's the believers who are too indoctrinated to realize that Hawkins was on another level of reasoning, level they are unable to comprehend due to their blinders. 
" and what ensued has been a massive game of telephone by people who, largely, have no direct insight or understanding of god. " - Of course nobody has understanding of God as there is no reason to believe such entity exists and therefore ever even communicated with any human.
"That's why religions tend to be useless. " - agreed, well.. there might be a small usage of it as for the purpose of a community, the feeling of belonging to something might make you feel better on a psychological level. This does not mean that it's a result of the belief in something that actually is true.
"But their original formation points to the inherent all-knowledge we all have access to." - You lost me here.. Please explain how do you know this. Through direct revelation from God or are you assuming this through unsupported speculation?
"WITHOUT the need for costly and dangerous "tools" of science" - You lost me here. Don't know what you are talking about. Science is  a method. A very useful and only one method that actually works as far as we all know. So not sure what you are raging about.

Narrow path? So you believe in fairies? Why not? Cause evidence matters in that claim? Why not in the other claims you already believe in? This is a typical religious mindset. Start from conclusion and you can end up believing in some serious nonsense. This is not how scientific method works and this is why it’s the only method of finding truths we currently have that actually is proven to work. All the pseudoscience nonsense has no leg to stand on. Disagree? Then show me some evidence for any of your pseudoscientific claims. There is a reason why it’s called pseudoscience and it’s not because it’s so good the real scientists can’t get their heads wrapped around it and are childish as you wrote about Hawkins. It’s because it tries to sell itself as science and yet there is zero evidence to even begin to entertain these ideas as serious claims. It’s just pure nonsense.

“Does it bother you that what science calls "facts" are continually proven to be wrong over time? “. - by who? Give examples. Again, you have a poor understanding of how science works. You should google the term “scientific method” and read about it.
“Don't you think this will keep happening? A very interesting character is Wim Hoff, "The Iceman," who has been able to influence his autonomic nervous system, something science claims is beyond our mortal control, through meditation and breathing. “ - who made those claims, your pseudoscience writers? How do they know what they claim is actually true?
“And now he's having these science geeks study him while he does his thing, so they can "prove" it to themselves. “ - yeah ok. Your brain is fed pseudoscience and you believed in it. I understand you as at one time in my life I was also fooled by pseudoscience and fell for it. When in my teens I watched a lot of history channel. Unbeknown to be as I was only a teenager I was under impression that History channel actually talked about real facts. From shit like pyramids to bullshit medicine and near death experience claims I gulped it all down. Then few years later when I actually started reading reliable sources I realized I was being lied to. You should start asking yourself who wrote what you read. Are these people even educated on the subject? Are they respected in their fields? Do they even study  that a specific field? How many other respectable people in those fields agree with the conclusions of that person when reviewing the claims and evidence the person used to arrive at these conclusions? People you listen to are fiction writers that’s all. 
“The method of a scientist is to continually prove themselves wrong, and tamper with everything along the way. I don't think this is sustainable “ - again I will refer you to reading about “scientific method and it’s process”. You will then understand what is science and how does it work. Scientists don’t temper with shit. They study a subject and it’s evidence publish their work and have it reviewed by others who study the same subject. Those people then can make their own independent studies trying to replicate the same experiments and draw their own conclusions. The more people do this and if al of their conclusions match the likelihood of that theory being true is extremely high. There is currently no other method that works as good as the scientific one. On the other hand you have pseudoscience. Bullshit writers publish a fiction book where they make unjustified claims, provide anecdotal evidence and have no other respectable person who actually studies this subject confirm those conclusions better yet actually many of these people refute these claims. But people who just want to believe in supernatural claims out of their emotional need tend to gravitate to believe the magical claims because it makes them feel good.

"here I'm using the word "god" to refer to the universe and it's rules" - Not sure why as we already have a word "universe" that perfectly describes itself. 
"inside our dna is the code not only to develop from single celled organisms into fully conscious beings, but lots of other wisdom as well." - It seems to me like you misrepresenting what DNA code really is in order to fit your personal beliefs about "GOD". 
"One might even call it god-like knowledge, omniscience, dev console." - You lost me here. Again, you seem to imply that DNA is a code set up by an intelligent being. Current scientific understanding of the genetic code does not come to this conclusion at all, actually the opposite. The word "random mutation" is there for a reason.
"Expressed routinely as 'instinct' and accessible through heightened states... Near death experience, psychedelics, tantra, breathing, chanting, dance, asceticism, etc." - Again, there is no evidence to conclude NDE is real, nor there is evidence that the other states are anything supernatural in nature. I'm not really sure what you are trying to imply here. 
"Probably states Mr hawking found himself in often due to his continual proximity to his own mortality. I'd refer you to graham hancock for further reading on the dna subject." - Now, why would I ever consider Graham Hancock's writings anything than pseudoscience? Now I seem to understand what you are trying to convey. You seem to think pseudoscience is real and science isn't. Well you got it wrong. This also explains why you think Hawkins understanding of religion was childish. You believe in pseudoscience. Hawkins did not, rightfully so. There is zero evidence to conclude any pseudoscientific hypothesis is to be taken seriously. Until such evidence is presented we should not jump into conclusions about existence of some deistic God and some mumbo jumbo hyperstates of some consciousness. 
You fail to realize that your beliefs are unsupported. When you finally find the evidence for those claims then you can call Hawkins and other skeptics(including me) childish. For now we are the ones who use rational method of dismissing unsupported hypothesis such as deistic Gods, intelligent designers, life after death and so on.

“Science hasn't really helped... Helped some hurt some. “ - lol, are serious? Please educate yourself on the benefits of science. Your position sounds very simpleminded.
“You see how silly this is, asking me for scientific evidence? I won't go digging through dead information to satisfy you. I don't have time.” - I’ll spare you time, don’t look because there isn’t any evidence for your pseudoscience. Again , there is a reason why it’s called pseudoscience and it’s not because it’s so revolutionary even scientists can’t grasp it, it’s the opposite. Scientists looked at it and conclusively made the same conclusion that its just bullshit claims.

Crypto has a big potential but from what I’ve observed is that the initial enthusiasm from early 2017 has evaporated and there are less and less new entrants everyday.

The Bible and Quran also got traction not because they are true but because the readers connect with it emotionally.

So he was invoking inconclusive studies on tiny samples where the numbers in a long term follow up were pretty much around 60% on a sample of 9 individuals, number quite tiny to make such general conclusions. While the studies have not proved anything significant the conclusion where Peterson tries to inject the cause for the success of the abstinence as supernatural explanation is simply pulling shit out of his ass. It’s like the claim the near death experience folks talk about seeing Jesus therefor it must be real experience and not a more reasonable non-supernatural explanation. 
As far as the claim that Nazism was an atheist doctrine is a blatant lie. You seem to disagree, care to provide sources where one can conclude that atheists have created a doctrine of nazism?

Nowhere in any of my posts have I acknowledged that I am here to argue and write pages of argumentation debunking every fallacious argument Peterson makes. Plenty of this has been done either in live debates, videos or writing. Watch it, read it, and use critical thinking in order to evaluate Peterson’s claims. Some of them are easily refuted and that’s a telltale sign that he is not as intelligent as his cult followers perceive him to be. One needs to be extremely ignorant to agree with him on his claims on atheism. There are no atheist because true atheists would be murderers since lack of faith in god leads to no morality. Hitler’s Germany was a result of such circumstances and the murders committed by the 95% Catholic population was somehow such act. Just simply wrong and ignorant to the point of extremism. To grant him such claims to be true one must be void of any critical thinking or doing so with an intent to tarnish atheism in favor of promoting of Christian culture. There are many other positions he takes which are equally ridiculous on many other subjects. I am not going to sit here and debate this and I got no time to sit here and argue with people who don’t see these fallacious argument from Peterson’s side. You are blind if you don’t see it.

More false statements by you. 
1. I can prove to you I have more upvotes overall on reddit than downvoted so you are wrong in that. One fact.
2. You are now resorting to ad hominem attacks
This is a typical game of every person who loses and argument when a detailed discussion is happening and one party asks for an actual evidence from the other party to support their claims. You realize you got no leg to stand on and now you are resorting to ad hominem attacks and changing topics instead of presenting the actual facts you have been asked for. 
Let me guess... your next reply will be more ad hominem attacks and then you will never respond again. 
One day when you realize that you cannot defend some of Peterson’s claims as there actually is no evidence for what he says but a bunch of word salad you might want to come to the /skeptic subreddit and learn something new. Discussions about Peterson and his positions are quite common.

You pointed out to wiki, which I’m fine with as long as the quotations on it are sourced and verified.

I’m fine with this, every other honest scientists will realize that but Peterson insists to create his own version of reality on inconclusive evidence. He tried to make a point that we already have evidence for supernatural via such conclusions from this study. How he draw the conclusion that chemical reactions in the brain from psychedelic drugs equals to supernatural world exists and is the cause of the higher than typical abstinence levels from smoking is beyond me. It’s a fallacy every other average philosopher will realize is being committed but not Peterson. Tunnel vision or purposeful tricks? 
“...didn't you take history in school? Nazis where also socialist and that's an inconvenient truth that many would like to also ignore. Don't identify with any one group too much and that includes being an Atheist.  Take care.”
I’m sorry but you are wrong here. And yes I did take history in school and I have no idea where are you saying such points in history books were listed. 
The link to the wiki site clearly explains that Nazi Germans were 95% made out of Christians and only 1.5% were nonbelievers so how did you draw a conclusion that Nazis were atheists or atheism led to nazism is beyond me. As far as the extra sentence on socialism... What did it meant to imply? I’ve heard this argument before somehow comparing socialism to atheism, was that your intent?
Let me copy and paste a good quote  from Hitchens on this topic when debating this same claim:
“Atheism by itself is, of course, not a moral position or a political one of any kind; it simply is the refusal to believe in a supernatural dimension. For you to say of Nazism that it was the implementation of the work of Charles Darwin is a filthy slander, undeserving of you and an insult to this audience. Darwin’s thought was not taught in Germany; Darwinism was so derided in Germany along with every other form of unbelief that all the great modern atheists, Darwin, Einstein and Freud were alike despised by the National Socialist regime.
Now, just to take the most notorious of the 20th century totalitarianisms – the most finished example, the most perfected one, the most ruthless and refined one: that of National Socialism, the one that fortunately allowed the escape of all these great atheists, thinkers and many others, to the United States, a country of separation of church and state, that gave them welcome – if it’s an atheistic regime, then how come that in the first chapter of Mein Kampf, that Hitler says that he’s doing God’s work and executing God’s will in destroying the Jewish people? How come the fuhrer oath that every officer of the Party and the Army had to take, making Hitler into a minor god, begins, “I swear in the name of almighty God, my loyalty to the Fuhrer?” How come that on the belt buckle of every Nazi soldier it says Gott mit uns, God on our side? How come that the first treaty made by the Nationalist Socialist dictatorship, the very first is with the Vatican? It’s exchanging political control of Germany for Catholic control of German education. How come that the church has celebrated the birthday of the Fuhrer every year, on that day until democracy put an end to this filthy, quasi-religious, superstitious, barbarous, reactionary system?”
If you want to clarify your evidence on atheism led to nazism you will need more to actually prove your point. I have no idea how after reading the wiki link you drew a conclusion that atheism was responsible for Nazism.

I don’t debate folks who lack basic understanding of burden of proof.
