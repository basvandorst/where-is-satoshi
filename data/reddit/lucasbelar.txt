But do I have to open a channel to buy a coffee?  this channel is expensive? I guess LN will be fine for big companies and exchange. To normal user doesn't make difference, the fees will keep high. 
Am I wrong? 
@_date: 2017-08-25 18:04:26
I guess that problem (high fees) will be fixed. But zero fees is only possible with IOTA. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 18:09:30
People are looking forward when these high fees will be low. And people are avoid Fiat  because the Big Debt government and financial sistem will drive us to another financial crisis. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:43:45
Yes. I totally agree with you. Putin worry about dollar's hegemony. Dollar is FIAT money, he know that bitcoin can be alternative to world financial unsustainable system

I didn't want to make any generalization.Even in a prison system we have good people. Come on, you know that bitcoin has many challenges and the issues are being debated childishly. Get it as a constructive criticism
