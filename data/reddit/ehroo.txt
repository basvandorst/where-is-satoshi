Do you think he's still at their office in NYC (the address that used to be listed on the site)?
If anyone wants the address, I found it using that Internet Archive Wayback Machine thing. Personally I'm sending them a letter regarding my money, but if I don't hear anything may have to pay them a visit.
27-29 W 60th St. 
New York, NY 10023
Just to save you some time: it's a block from the 59th St./Columbus Circle stop.

I've got over $5k in there. I'm currently putting together a letter to send to their offices in New York with all of my information demanding my money. Doubt it will actually do anything but might as well try. 
Honestly, I don't see how he could get away with NOT giving our money back. How is that possible? It wasn't an investment; I see it as similar to having money in, say, a Paypal account. It's just being held there. Right? The only reason I can see that we wouldn't get it back would be if he stole it. It couldn't actually be "lost" for any legitimate reason like last time with the bitcoins...
Does anyone think it would actually be worth it to pay a visit to their office in NYC? Would that be weird? Cause I'm not above being weird in order to fix this.

This might be a terrible idea for all I know, but does anyone think it would be worth it to actually pay a visit to Bitfloor's office in NYC in person? Or would that be too crazy? I'm just thinking about how the internet causes people to be cowardly; it's a lot harder to ignore someone in your face than through email.

What do you consider a "large amount"? I've got a little over $5k in there; would my own lawyer be worth it?
