I wonder if when Coinbase gets hacked, there will be a smoking gun in this AMA that is quoted as the Bitfinex 'we're 100% secure' quote.
@_date: 2016-08-03 04:52:49
This is why I'm a fan of a system that takes your public keys for Bitcoin. You want to sell, put in the private key and the server signs itself whatever you are selling minus Bitcoin fees. But no, people just want to have it on their shiny page that they "hold 100M+ worth of Bitcoin", I'd rather have "hold 0 Bitcoin"
@_date: 2016-08-16 16:17:40
Well, you did want de-regulated exchanges with no KYC... I guess we're good then.

Standard Lawyer Training: If you can't argue the law, you argue the semantics, if you can't argue the semantics, you argue the law and if you can't argue either, you hope the other side fails just as hard as you.
PS: When a company takes your money, it goes on the books as "Assets", and what you get back is "Liabilities". This works for every model from Amazon to Ebay. If it goes belly-up asset liquidation will occur to settle liabilities, if it's insolvency, you'll just get a portion back.
@_date: 2016-08-03 05:54:18
Will be set by lawsuits stemming from the insolvency of Bitfinex.
Remember, when you hold funds that are not yours, they're considered "liabilities" on the books. Upon liquidation, "liabilities" are paid out (partially if insufficient money exists)
Edit: Probably same as the Mt Gox incident, people will get portions paid out.

Yeah, but I back up my keys/secondary HW wallet in my safe.

Correction, their money, you only have Bitfinex IOUs.
Golden rule: You don't own the private key, you don't have Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-08-03 04:45:50
Remember, this is an "exchange". Being able to "buy" or "sell" quickly would be stopped by having to sign with your private key.
@_date: 2016-08-06 01:54:43
You don't have crypto on Bitfinex, you have Bitfinex IOUs. If you don't have the private keys, you have nothing.

Suing Bitfinex will trigger bankruptcy. All assets will be sold off and pooled. Once that occurs, lawyers will take their pound of flesh. Estimate you get back 40% or less of your coins if it goes to bankruptcy.

IOUs that become Bitcoin over time. 
Also, it's 159k BTC, not 90 million.
Remember, it's just a race against time on how long it takes to make everyone "whole".
Bitfinex is also profitable, so they can just dump the profits right into payouts for fulfilling IOUs.

When a big client comes along, they get whatever they want. This is the problem with close-sourced exchanges. You get "security by obscurity" but can't be sure if it's real security or something that sounds like it. For reference -&gt;

I'm actually getting 0% return on deposit either way (never used Bitfinex)
Honestly, 64% is probably the best you'll get as a return, once lawyers get involved, I think the number will drop by 1-2% every 3 months until the situation is sorted out. I would estimate the final return at around 30% to 40%

That's my point, they want the wallets to be owned by them. If you separate the "deposit - putting Bitcoin into your Bitfinex wallet" and "sell - putting the Bitcoin into an internal ledger for sale" action, you can see how holding coins for a long time can hurt you.
I'm thinking of a prototype exchange, you give your public key and then sign the funds to the exchange when putting a "sell" order. "buy" orders are deposited directly to your public key. Wonder if people would use it.

It's who claims any protocol change without overwhelming consensus is an altcoin... ergo, Segwit Altcoin will be that until it reaches 75% consensus (currently at 21.3% of last 1000 blocks)
@_date: 2017-02-05 01:05:25


Remember, consensus is a part of Bitcoin. If you think this is an attack on Bitcoin, then you should pull out of it since your risk tolerance is far lower than required. If mining consensus shifts, that's expected from Bitcoin since it's not a regulated currency.
@_date: 2017-02-08 03:52:15
One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter. Don't worry, we'll patch in SegWit after BU activates.
@_date: 2017-02-05 04:48:45
Any decent exchange would run both chains and just disburse to both. 
Your private keys can be used to access the wallet on either one.
Losses would come from people mining the wrong chain, not people buying.
@_date: 2017-02-04 18:39:01
It's a currency, not some ideological idea. People like money.
@_date: 2017-02-04 16:46:47
That's the thing, hardforks give you the same coins in both chains.
There's only losses during the small time that it takes for people to abandon the original chain. If the change is quick (1-2 days), you would only lose the coins during those two days.
@_date: 2017-02-04 16:47:36


Yeah, those altcoins with no consensus like... Segwit.
@_date: 2017-02-26 02:54:06

@_date: 2017-02-04 16:45:31
Well, how about you go hold your Segwit non-consensus altcoin (own words) and let people who have consensus lead.
Once BU is activated, we can talk about testing your altcoin and seeing if it works.

@_date: 2016-01-23 01:20:01
Couple of issues.
1) Most exchanges will not like this and you may be banhammered.
2)You will have to pay capital gain taxes in the US. If not from the US, talk to your tax dude. Taxes are only paid on the profits from capital gains.
@_date: 2016-01-23 07:45:49
Capital gains taxes are paid on profits on investments. Welcome home Bitcoin as a commodity. Think of it as oil trading.
@_date: 2016-01-29 23:46:29
So, the answer I've heard about this is that you are already paying taxes (IE: sales taxes).
Now, if you sell your coins for cash, you pay taxes in a different way (IE: capital gains taxes).
What's really interesting is that if you sell your coins at a loss and have proper documentation, you can write off the sale as a loss (IE: under capital gains). This would actually lower your tax bill if you are high income.
@_date: 2017-03-10 15:58:54

Bitcoin gives the miner a free 12.5 BTC for mining the block, the average block worth of transactions is like 0.3 to 0.7 BTC, it's not worth it if you lose the subsidy.

So you can take your Segwit altcoin and just fuck right off with the gilt trip.
@_date: 2017-02-04 17:05:57
I don't think so.
If we truly got to the point that BU got enough to activate, noone would attempt to stop it, people would fold and upgrade. 
There's far too much money on the line in mining to just keep mining a dead chain. It would take a bit for wallets to become BU-compatible... but mining-wise, we could move everyone over fairly quickly.

You can also import your public key to Mycelium to have your balance available...

It takes time to fill the block and bigger blocks take more time to propagate so you're risking losing your money.
In a fully greedy system, the subsidy is far higher than the fee, so there's no reason to hold blocks and sending empty blocks is completely legal and viable.

The way I used to do it was to create an account and just send 1 satoshi into it with 0 fee so their 0-transaction would give you a new address after you refresh the browser. Store the addresses as you go.
Do it enough time and you can exhaust the dark market's pool of addresses (they reuse every so often and just keep track of tx hashes)
Keep it going until you get addresses you have already have stored pop up more than 100 times in a row then you should have all of them.
The 1 satoshi transactions will time out eventually since there's no fees.
I would then sell these packs of dark market addresses to anyone who wanted them for their service.

0-day is a common term for a security flaw that has not been discovered.
Here's one from a little while ago for Android devices -&gt; 
Basically, you open an SMS and your phone can be forced to run malicious code. Most internet connected devices (laptops, computers, phones) run software that can be exploited. The reason hardware wallets are recommended is that they are "isolated" from the internet and may be "slightly more secure" than a normal network connected device.
If you still want to do this with a phone, get a separate android for your wallet (a cheap $50 android will do it), move the APK using a flash drive and don't connect that device to the internet (ever).
@_date: 2016-12-30 00:24:16

The reason I say is because I've seen plenty of posts of people who go like "Yeah, I'll take out a mortgage on my house and just buy bitcoin" and then the price dips like 5% and they're posting here about checking themselves in a mental hospital because of a suicide risk. I dislike egging someone on a financial decision that then fails for them.

Remember SPV is generally used to convey whether you have to download the entire 200GB blockchain or not to use the wallet.
Mycellium uses external servers to broadcast the transaction from your phone. You'll find a lot of the fancier wallets do this (Copay and others). This can lead to your identity being leaked but only when you issue payments. This can also lead to double spends if you're accepting Bitcoin for goods

Welcome to the problem with Technical Writing. There's no 'technically smart', just more 'technically inclined. If you write your instructions so that an "idiot could read it" (no offense), then people will think you're insulting their intelligence.

There's certain steps that people can understand and some others can't but making it too simple turns off people.
Also, $25 is not a bad amount for something that is new and exciting and you don't fully understand. The first time I transfered myself $100 and it took some time to confirm, I thought I had lost the whole thing.
Edit: Remember the person making these guides also have done this thing 20-30 times in order to write a good guide and not look like a fool. When you do something multiple times, you forget to add basic steps like "write down your backup" or "plug the USB cable into the computer"

The Internal Revenue Service treats Bitcoin as a commodity which means you may need to pay taxes on Capital Gains so unless you'd like to flee the country, you should keep some records of what amount of Bitcoin and at what price you bought for if you ever decide to sell when Bitcoin's price increases.

My accountant.


If the combined amount is less than $100, yes. Remember that you pay taxes on your "profits". If you bought a $50 gift card but your profit on it was $5, then you only count that $5.


Noone is going to launch an audit of your $1,000 in Bitcoin. They may launch an audit if you cash out $2,000,000 in Bitcoin to cash.

Remember, nodes crash because they run out of memory. The easiest way to crash your node is to have some shithead like me generating addresses left and right.
A decent high level company will just generate a couple hundred addresses from an HD seed and just cycle through them. When a new transaction comes in, they tie the tx hash to the customer that has it assigned and pick another unused address from the pool. When the tx hash has enough confirmations, the balance is "pulled" into that user's account.

Yeah, and when they crack the seal, they can spend it. 
So they can borrow it, check the balance, accept your terms and they can crack the seal when they want to spend it.

My main use case is redundancy against hard drive death or mobile phone death.
It's basically a more secure paper wallet.

Welcome to the Adoption Problem. We've trying to get ahold of you since 2009.
@_date: 2016-12-24 15:14:33
Find another exchange.
@_date: 2016-12-11 06:04:27
So here's the idea I was told when I filed last year.
Consider Bitcoin a commodity. 
If you sold your commodity and made a profit, then you pay your taxes on that.
If you bought your commodity and lost it (like an exchange hack), then you can write it off.
However if the amount involved are small ($100 or less), just don't bother, the taxes on $100 are tiny.

They don't sell it in your country?
Are you sure? They ship international... -&gt; buytrezor.com/
I'm not saying you need one to start off, it's that the more you have, the more it's going to hurt if your Bitcoin vanish from your smartphone.
@_date: 2016-12-03 18:08:22
Yes, and you don't get force updates in Trezor.
You can just never update it.
@_date: 2016-12-07 20:26:23
The issue with AML/KYC compliance is that the costs do not scale linearly.
At the lower end, if you're just starting out, be prepared to spend thousands to outfit your systems with fraud detection and buying darknet market addresses to ensure your buyers aren't just depositing into their favorite weed dealing black market site.
At the middle end, you're dealing with filling SARs and other things for people doing shady shit (like showing up and buying $50,000 in Bitcoin at once) and tracking people's occupation and other crap (the Coinbase survey basically)
At the higher end, you'll spend lots of money on lawyers and computer algorithms to track the bitcoins to see how many hops until a suspicious address (IE, an address that has lots of inputs and very little outputs, competitor exchanges)

One extra thing, if you're buying more than $1000 in Bitcoin, please spend $99 on a Trezor or a KeepKey.
These are hardware wallets designed to be virus resistant and hack resistant. You can plug them into your phone or any computer which allows them to be around for years. You can also use them as hardware password managers that can't be hacked (Trezor in particular)
@_date: 2016-12-30 00:43:31
That's the other thing, spreading out buys over months makes any lower or increasing of price to be easy to withstand.
I started my weekly buys at $360 and ended at $850 so it's impossible for me to be depressed as long as it doesn't fall below $360. Anyone who buys a large quantity at a specific price point will feel it when it drops below that.
@_date: 2016-12-24 00:55:05
That is true as well, the reason for suggesting the original sites is that they accept Bitcoin :D
@_date: 2016-12-24 02:54:56
Yes, you are right as well. 
Ledger is actually awesome and has some interesting form factors. (I'm talking about the wireless contact NFC one for phones)
@_date: 2016-11-07 20:38:23
LOL, what?
@_date: 2015-08-09 03:31:03
Advantages: Not going to prison.
Disadvantages: You have to scan people's ID's.
Generally, the third parties are KYC Validators (Know Your Customer)
@_date: 2015-08-20 03:28:23
When the state comes in and pulls the plug, it's gonna be fucking hilarious.
@_date: 2015-08-10 20:57:53
Hey, man, just a quick reminder that Bitcoin under most cities is considered a Money Transmitting Business and you may required additional licensing.
You should consult with a lawyer regarding KYC/AML compliance.
PS: I would really dislike anyone from this subreddit to go to pound-me-in-the-ass prison for something like that.
@_date: 2015-07-18 16:51:05
State says we don't need AML regulation but if you want a credit line/bank account for your bitcoin shit, you need customer verification.
The key thing is to ensure someone doesn't "double-buy". IE: buy $100 again and again and again to bypass the limits.
&lt; $100 : No identification required
$100 - $500 : ID verification against terrorist/gun dealer DB
$500 - $5000 : Passport picture along with phone number
more than $ 5000 : Fingerprints.
Edit: Places without ID will have a few things occur. Either they get caught by the IRS (money laundering) or the FBI will send someone with an ID flagged as a terrorist... you sell, you burn, 10 to 25. There's no 'oops' if you're selling to terrorists.

Actually, the outside databases are only used to check if you're a baddy (your name). Each individual ATM provider decides what they do with your ID scan (most of them hold it for 24 hours but worked alongside some that toss it as soon as they know you're not a bad guy, they mostly log how much fiat they transfer to each wallet, read below).
The main issue is someone buying massive bundles like $5,000 over a few days. There's nothing wrong with buying bitcoin, it's just people tend to find interesting ways around paying taxes and bitcoin is considered a "tax haven"
Most ATMs only care about the PDF-417 behind your ID (contains your address and your name -&gt;  so they don't even store the damn picture.
I agree with most people that privacy should come first but an untraceable format that leaves no trail scares legislators.
@_date: 2015-07-21 14:57:30
I looked at it.
Is there a plan for an API for any of these features?
Some of these purchase options could be interesting for automated bots (also, pricing in USD)

Generally operating a shovel in the gold rush isn't as profitable as selling the shovels.
Right now, it's a race to the bottom, you hold the chips, someone else can sell their technology.
@_date: 2016-02-12 02:49:38
Please help yourself to some literature.
If you'd like, you can head off with your Bitcoin and hope for the best.
PS: Internet service in Cuba for mobile devices is sold at $2 per 2 hours. There are no BTMs there. 
@_date: 2016-02-12 02:15:49
Remember that Cuba is a country with no internet... at all.
Even if you brought bits, you couldn't spend them.
Bring cash, good luck.
@_date: 2016-02-12 03:18:21
Good luck. I wish you the best travels on using your digital currency in a country where less than 20% of people have internet at home/business.
@_date: 2015-07-18 23:13:35
Editted previous one to show what it costs for non-ID machines.
@_date: 2016-12-29 23:32:17
Trezor uses a specific 24 word backup but you can restore it using Electrum.
@_date: 2016-02-16 03:33:50
Sounds interesting.
Any of the existing API's could do this (websocket for monitoring send addresses)
Recommend something cross-platform that runs on Javascript (because easy-as-shit websockets) and SQLite.

Seize the hardware since it's company hardware. Anyone complains, have them submit proof of purchase and the IT authorization to rack personal hardware inside your premises.
I guarantee they can't provide either. Alternatively, give them the hardware in exchange for their mining profits.

Topups from outside the Island are common.
People in Cuba have wifi access ($1 / hr) but unfortunately, it's heavily limited (email/imo messenger). They also pay $1 per text message/phone call minute.
@_date: 2016-09-08 21:18:44
Yes, but I'm sure they'll learn a lesson.
@_date: 2016-09-13 05:34:10
So good, we created 25 new countries.
Send me your countries and I'll double it.

Most ATMs will give you money at any paper currency amount (most don't accept quarters and nickels)
@_date: 2015-10-15 00:57:19
Does you app use Google Services Framework? If it doesn't, can you provide the APK for download from your webpage without using Google Play (some android phones don't ship with Google Play Store)
@_date: 2016-05-19 16:57:50
Get yourself a trezor. If you truly have 100+ BTC, then just get two, one for dipping it into a pool and the second one as a backup.
@_date: 2015-10-15 13:20:46
There are no alternatives for non-Google Android unless you download from Amazon Appstore or get the APK directly.
@_date: 2016-07-18 22:46:07
Try pulling the power plug and press the power button, should force restart it.
@_date: 2016-07-18 02:05:34
Interesting, wonder if printing a page with the orion constellation as a background would cause the page to be unable to be copied.
@_date: 2016-07-18 01:59:51
Yes, right now, there's a limited wifi (basic email &amp; "imo" chat)
@_date: 2016-07-10 04:00:03
I think you dropped this  /s
@_date: 2016-07-18 05:28:51
Yeah, I wonder if it will even work...
If only there was a show that tested myths... like some sort of Mythbusters.
Edit: Gonna try it out when I get to work tomorrow, see if my work scanner freaks the fuck out -&gt;
