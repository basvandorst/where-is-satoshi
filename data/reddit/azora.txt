Great point.

Just remember, you could die in a car crash tomorrow and lose your private keys or your exchange could get hacked. :)
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:49:45
you are a good man.
@_date: 2014-02-20 12:47:57
Fuck yeah this is the single most greatest thing I have ever downloaded.

So you're going to compare a process that takes years to understand, then even more years if you would like to change the language you speak, to a process that literally takes a few hours to adopt and change over?

To the moon! I'm finally going to go all in with all my savings because of this.
@_date: 2014-12-01 15:44:29
He's actually pretty spot on. Be it bitcoin or another cryptocurrency, this technology is world-changing.
@_date: 2014-05-01 23:51:59
Somebody's sad nobody is tipping him.
@_date: 2014-02-20 12:47:19
No it is not. 
@_date: 2014-06-01 01:36:16
All those badges are just so sinister.
@_date: 2014-03-21 09:36:44
What happened before?
@_date: 2014-06-08 05:45:54
Never realized litecoin had such a horrible logo.
@_date: 2014-02-09 10:10:07
Fucking spammer.
@_date: 2014-07-04 12:52:16
Woopdy doo. 
@_date: 2014-01-19 13:22:11
Some weird address? Please learn at least the basics of bitcoin before investing money in it. 
@_date: 2014-07-04 08:37:10
Woopdy doo.

I'm going to mortgage the house again. 
@_date: 2014-01-26 13:08:47
Why not use gold? Much less riskier than bitcoin, but it's entirely up to you and your risk assessment. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 12:30:52
Exactly this, currently many people are not worried about trusting another party with their money because we are so used to the banks being too big to fail etc. Once we see a true free market come about through decentralisation people will begin to look for companies with an ethical, safe and trustworthy reputation, the way it should be. 
@_date: 2014-05-31 14:29:23
It hasn't been that long since wide globalisation. Also, we still have shitty governments. 
@_date: 2014-04-17 03:32:10
Who cares what older people think. If they don't understand bitcoin they should stay as far away as they can from it.
@_date: 2014-03-11 07:05:21
This is bitcoins biggest flaw.
@_date: 2014-04-03 09:58:31
Thank god, humans should be using automation to get rid of all jobs. Why be a slave when a robot can slave for you? 
It's the economic system that needs fixing, we need a Unconditional basic income. 
@_date: 2014-01-03 14:23:18
But doesn't cash have this same problem? 
@_date: 2014-03-19 10:44:30
Create a specific voting coin. Give every registered citizen 1 whole indivisible coin. Each candidate has a specific address. Voters send their coin to candidates. Computers can do all the counting etc. 
@_date: 2014-03-12 02:27:28
@_date: 2014-12-01 23:35:37
No you don't mate. 
@_date: 2014-05-01 23:50:59
Could we possibly get Reddit Enhancement Suite (RES) to implement this feature? It could be optional.
@_date: 2014-05-15 01:40:21
Even plants kill to survive.
@_date: 2014-02-06 22:18:54
Yeah, MONEY TALKS.
@_date: 2014-08-13 14:15:27
Yeah he's actually quite an intelligent business man. 
@_date: 2014-01-14 23:55:24
Why does bitcoin even have such a weakness? Is there any sort of change that they can implement in the protocol to prevent this? It's absolute bullshit to see such a huge weakness in bitcoin like this. 
@_date: 2019-10-20 23:02:25
Wow that's almost 5% of Australia trading at one time. We are only a population of roughly 22 million.
@_date: 2017-11-14 09:17:17
slippery slope?
@_date: 2015-07-05 06:34:51
Voat is a reddit clone with none of it's own innovation. Why would I support them?
@_date: 2017-10-23 14:20:09
True that bitcoin is entirely dependant on the dollar value right now but when mass adoption tips you won't be paying your vendors with the dollar, they will want bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-10-31 12:59:53
YAY ANOTHER BUBBLE. LOVE THEM.
@_date: 2015-10-31 13:01:19
you dont know what yar on about mate. its all in or nothing time fellas. we're off to da moon.
@_date: 2017-06-16 06:16:32
thank you, really appreciate this.
@_date: 2017-06-16 06:16:20
thank you!
@_date: 2013-11-13 10:38:30
I don't understand this. Isn't it pointless if no one else is connected to the Internet anymore? 
@_date: 2013-12-10 08:12:36
Lol, oppressive bankers are getting scared. This is comedy. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 08:11:38
I don't quite understand the honey badger analogy, anyone care to explain? 
@_date: 2013-11-11 04:46:04
...and more internet users are still coming.
@_date: 2013-11-21 13:59:54
Can we get a thorough, well written, pre-made letter that everyone can either print out or email to all the local businesses they know of? One explaining the entirety of bitcoin in an easy to understand format for merchants. We could even put it in the sidebar for all users to access. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 12:41:32
They're just shooting themselves in the foot in the long run. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 01:03:50
It shouldn't be 'illegal' to begin with.
