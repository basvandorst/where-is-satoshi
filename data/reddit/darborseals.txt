I buy it so I can send donations to 'thought criminals' who get banned from Paypal and Patreon for their ideas.

It's exaggerated imo. If you had money in the stock market and had just bought a new house then you were fucked financially on paper, but no one was starving. 
Houses lost value in major population areas and the stock market went down by about 50%, but now 11 years later it's at about double what it was before the crash happened.

I wanted to get out ASAP. Meteoric rises scare me.

How many BTC are estimated to be lost forever? It's gotta be a huge number from back when it was almost worthless.  You might only need .5 BTC to be in the 1 in 21 million club.

"Copper is more corrosion resistant than gold."
This is completely false. You can put a gold coin a the bottom of the ocean for 1000 years and it will look nearly the same as when it sunk. A copper coin would corrode. Do you just say things without thinking?

It's a good argument against democracy. Most people are pretty dumb or have self destructive habits. If you can't figure out how to rise to a better station in life you don't need to be deciding how the country is run.

Same, silver purchase online was my only BTC purchase. The price was around $14k and I felt like it was going to tank so I offloaded.  It went up about $5k more before tanking.

Aren't almost all cryptos decentralized and open source? If you're saying most of them have 1 or a few dudes at the top controlling it then maybe what I thought is incorrect. 
I thought the average guy could make a bitcoin copy by himself with the same technology and principle.

Yes, good point. I think the amount of cryptos is infinite though while the number of countries with currencies is limited. I assume there are around 200 state currencies today, but I could make my own crypto tomorrow and it would have the same blockchain tech as bitcoin. It just wouldn't be as well known. It seems the only thing that makes the bitcoin price so high is it being the first one.

This is my main concern with Bitcoin. It is exactly the same as many other cryptos. It's just the one that's most popular and accepted right now. No one knows what will be the most popular crypto in the future and there's no way to just bet on crypto as a whole. You have to choose a coin to put your money in and risk losing it all.

The hell! I had to pay 6 cents for my last transaction! I'm abandoning Bitcoin.

Hi from Gollopany!

Isn't all crypto based on the same thing and bitcoin is only big because it was the first and it most known though? 
I like Bitcoin but I'm skeptical because anyone can make a crypto that does exactly the same thing. Maybe name recognition will put bitcoin at the top forever, but maybe not.
Is there anything I can read that will tell me why Bitcoin is any different than Crypto made yesterday aside from name recognition and history of use?

It's Africa. They don't have enough personal responsibility to be in control of their own money (Bitcoin). They'd lose their private keys in a second and be starving. You know I'm right.

From 2k to 20k is a larger a distance on this graph than 0 to .1...
