Well I was giving you the benefit of the doubt to answer but then you wrote  said:
 Will you be answering questions over there?
They are completely out of control. Name calling, no basic level of respect, and just about all questions are loaded.
We are taking all the questions down, then going through them to answer, that way all the answers are in one place.

I seriously don't think people with be able to forgive until they can make there opinions heard on the hashtalk forum with out being banned it screams a cover up that makes people sit uneasy 
@_date: 2015-01-04 04:45:51
I don't think the majority of the people are disrespecting you this is aggravation for hashtalk censorship that they get to make there comments
