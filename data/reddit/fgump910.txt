Oh...gotcha! Well now I feel extra stupid, because once I placed the limit order and it went through...I put it back into my normal Coinbase wallet! Derp. Oh well, the more you know!

[These pieces of shit]( are the type of people shilling BitConnect. Anybody with half a brain can tell it's a pyramid scheme. Like all pyramid schemes it WILL work for people who got in early, so the success is there. Fuck...I even threw in $150 just to test it out and I'll be damned if I haven't made it back (I hate myself for it)! But that was months ago and I would NEVER put another cent in there. At some point the roof will come crashing down when they can't keep attracting new users to pay the dividends to the existing users. It will be a horrible day for Crypto.

That's pretty interesting! What this article is saying is that it is a common misconception that "tulip fever" affected the masses and caused some sort of economic collapse. In reality it was a silly little bubble of rich aristocrats fighting over a rare type of tulip bulb. Sure, it crashed but it was silly and not really comparable to Bitcoin in sense of adoption/scale etc.

Are you referring to sending USD to the GDAX exchange and setting a limit order? Yeah, I tried that but in the 7 business days it took to get to GDAX the BTC price had moved up by about $200. Obviously taking the fees was a better option unless I'm totally missing something...

Freyas - you definitely are an outlier in your technical prowess at your age. Mad props! I am advising several older individuals (i.e. all my parent's friends ago 60+) and I am very concerned that they will lose all their BTC to a scam. I am very adamant, however, they they don't invest anything they aren't willing to lose. Regardless, it is very hard to teach them about security and so forth because they are just used to the old way of doing things. Their brains basically explode when I try to explain basics like private/public keys. I don't blame them...Bitcoin is hard to learn and intimidating at first!
So - I think PSA like this post are definitely important as we see new blood enter the system. I don't want some clever scam ruining everybody's fun!

This guy's up in here about to implement a Python trading bot and gets tripped on the hardware wallet part. Hahaha...what the hell did you think you were reading?!

Is there any reasoning behind these large companies not adopting Segwit? I'm assuming they might get a higher fee %, but I thought that was mainly for the miners. Please ELI5!

So the developers of Monero can't just send Ledger or Trezor the code for creating a wallet? Wouldn't that be in everybody's best interest? Do not know how to store the currency they created? How do the exchanges know how to store it? This all still makes ZERO sense to me.

One of my favorite videos I show people who want to understand Bitcoin is Andreas' [Intro to Bitcoin]( talk he did over a year ago. Every word of it holds true today. I think he might turn some people off due to his lofty predictions for how bitcoin/blockchain will reshape the world...but so far he has been right on the money. I personally take what he says very seriously, as he is one of the smartest thinkers in the space, and he is able to communicate his ideas effectively.

Interesting! I guess "an historic" is "a historic" way of saying it [example]( Most higher educated older people still use "an historic" (in fact I used to get corrected by my english teach on this). I personally always thought it was stupid because of the hard "h" sound. I look forward to correcting WHOMever says this next, because I hear it frequently. Thanks!

Well, that's good to hear! But I'm legitimately curious about more than just Monero. Don't all of these currencies run off the same recipe? What is so difficult about creating a wallet that works with everything? I mean...David Hay [lost $50 in IOTA]( trying to demonstrate how to use their wallet, for example. 
Why would I have faith in buying crypto if people can't even figure out how to store it? The amount of innovation in blockchain in ludicrous....with the HUGE exception of wallets. What gives?

You have the right idea (full disclosure, I am with the IDEX team). While IDEX is currently using a hybrid approach to create a real-time decentralized trading environment, we are transitioning to a fully decentralized model in the near future with our staking token, AURA (50% of all IDEX and future Aurora project fees go to stakers for securing the fully decentralized system). You can learn more [here]( Happy trading!

Do a lot people actually go through the rigamarole of replacing the bitcoin right after spending it? Aren't they still subject to significant percentage loss even in a short timespan? I just don't picture mass adoption ever happening unless the price stabilizes. Right now it's definitely easier to just invest. I'm just thinking on a global scale here. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 22:47:18
What is the easiest method to do this? Seems like a whole lot of hassle and that the price could change significantly before they are actually replaced.

I really enjoyed this post FWIW. Agree on most all of it.
