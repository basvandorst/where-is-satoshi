Supply is only known in the long term. In the short and medium term, the number of bitcoins offered for sale on a given market will vary unpredictably.
Also MtGox is quite a profitable Bitcoin business.

I think they are already using it, hence the record difficulty level that has emerged over the last 2 months. They will make a handsome profit in block rewards, then when the difficulty has risen high enough to diminish those rewards, they will sell the hardware - and thanks to the inflated difficulty, miners will need it.
@_date: 2012-04-16 19:25:44
I'm struggling to find trade volume data older than the 60 days you get from bitcoincharts.com, but my perception is that volume is way down. 30-day volume on Mt Gox is $8.4m, but I'm fairly sure it was in the $20m range earlier in the year. I attribute that lower volume to the larger players (i.e. those with the ability to move the price significantly) just sitting it out until big news or drama comes along.

I haven't followed this trainwreck closely, so am I right in thinking that this is also the first announcement of the source code leak?

The difficulty would soon adjust, reducing the payback. Selling will have the same effect, except now they are the sole supplierof a device that everybody needs to stay competitive.

One interesting thing about mining is that the block reward never actually hits zero, it just falls below the smallest unit. So if everybody lost all the private keys, to every address, we could just move the decimal point to the right and the game would begin again, starting with the next block. But you may as well start a new blockchain at that point.
@_date: 2012-06-12 20:24:23
What I describe is a stable equilibrium. I don't understand your point. Bitcoin will never become dominant due to instability caused by its dominance?

Bitcoin will only be safe from government when Bitcoin stakeholders are as wealthy as central bankers currently are and have the same power to whisper in the ears of politicians. So if each bitcoin was worth $1m then a mature Bitcoin system would be backed by the equivalent of $21tn of bribing power. Governments listen to organisations with that kind of cash.

No, because bitcoins are infinitely divisible. As long as we have even one satoshi, we can redenominate and subdivide.
@_date: 2012-06-12 19:24:21
Wouldn't such seizing be self-correcting? As Bitcoin becomes harder to use due to hoarding, alternatives would become more attractive, thus reducing the value of Bitcoin and reducing the incentive to hoard.

Like with any money, you should invest it based on your needs (not wants) and risk appetite. If you have a real need for that pizza then you have no choice: you must buy it! But if you have no pressing need to spend the money on food, rent, healthcare, etc. then it's a question of whether you want to invest it in a high-risk high-potential reward asset like Bitcoin, or cash out into something safer with lower potential rewards.

@_date: 2012-07-27 06:55:45
Is supply really known? In the long run, we know the total number of bitcoins, so in that sense it is. But in the short term, the majority of bitcoins are held in cold storage or otherwise not for sale. And even when they are up for sale, they are generally offered in only one market (you can't list your bitcoins on both MtGox and Intersango).
So the supply in any given market, at any particular time, is measurable independently from demand.

Since you mention security, it sounds like you may be buzzword compliant. But I fear that is not nearly enough, given the history of Bitcoin trading platforms. A secure system must be designed, built and operated with security as a fundamental principle. What I actually see is devops (who are no doubt talented and enthusiastic) hacking up a working prototype *and then treating security as some kind of add-on module*.
Will you have your platform security independently audited?

Pure speculation but here goes...
Short term (next 3 years):
Bitcoin will see no significant mainstream adoption or attention. The core network will be improved incrementally and the price will probably increase slightly. The first block reward halving will make little difference to the wholesale market, having already been priced in. Mining will become less profitable but will continue to be subsidized by those with free electricity, botnets, and enthusiasts. The opportunity for a hard fork will pass.
Medium term (5-20 years):
After the second block reward halving, Bitcoin will have proven its endurance in the collective unconscious - well-known and with successful niche applications such as gambling and smalltime black market trading. Adoption will follow the pattern of Linux: technical evangelists bootstrapping into markets or creating new markets, followed by "back-end" enterprise success, perhaps as a payment clearing system or arbitrage vehicle. Still little mainstream adoption, but significant value-per-coin growth. Legal challenges will be indirect; no country will attempt to ban Bitcoin outright, but may attempt "cut off their air supply" legislation, analagous to software patents. They will fail.
Long term (25 years+):
The ultimate success of Bitcoin will lie in the mass rollout of cheap internet-connected devices to the 3rd world. Bitcoin will be there on the ground as a value-store and payment solution before the banks. The killer app will be remittances. It will catalyse genuine economic security for the billions who currently have minimal experience of property ownership. It will receive state backing from a developing economy. The first world mainstream will take notice, but will already be heavily invested in it so there will be no conspiracy to destroy it. Newfound success will test the scalability of the network but a hard fork will now be so hard to coordinate that a competing cryptocurrency may be the easier route to an upgrade. Cryptographic weaknesses will be uncovered well in advance of any attacks becoming feasible. Mainstream success will come in the form of off-chain transactions made between regular banking and credit systems. Mining will not be profitable even with increased transaction fees, but will be subsidised by institutions who have a vested interest in the global economy. Bitcoin income will be taxed and monitored. Major economies will use Bitcoin and their own fiat currencies in tense but peaceful coexistence, as the very presence of an easy alternative store of value will reign in the ability of states to raise taxes via inflation. Each Bitcoin will be worth enough to make its owner feel wealthy.
@_date: 2012-06-15 07:18:34
I'm not sure how it is clear that a product that isn't even announced will dominate the mining market.
@_date: 2012-01-17 08:15:22
 I believe there will come a point where the transaction volume will level off, as higher level services, like banks and credit card companies, take over ordinary payment processing. Then, bitcoin will only move as part of "inter-bank" settlements, the same way gold moves only rarely today.

Maybe I misread the weasel explanation but hasn't he simply sent 20BTC to his own address?
@_date: 2012-04-11 19:54:42
To the edit: I guess you are talking about a kind of account fee - a charge for looking after your Bitcoins for you. There's definitely a business model there, independent of inflation or deflation. Just like banks assume the risks of holding physical cash in exchange for a fee (though these days current-account banking tends to be free for as long as the bank believes it can leverge your custom to upsell you into other services).

It's a kind of null hypothesis. In the absence of any clear drivers of price, speculation is the only remaining explanation.
@_date: 2012-06-17 10:45:43
If you include the 50BTC block reward then the fee is more like $325, plus the tiny incremental devaluation of the 1 million BTC due to inflation.
Once all 21 million coins are mined, there will be no more inflation, but miners will still want that $325-equivalent to pay for their operations. If they spread that fee across all 1007 transactions in this block, that's $0.32 per transaction.
I foresee two ways of getting that transaction fee down:
1. Increase transaction volume to spread it out.
2. Public service mining by entities so heavily invested in the success of Bitcoin that they will happily mine at a loss to keep the system going.

Bitcoin is totally taxable, more so than cash. Governments just have to impose a responsibility to report taxable earnings, and back it up with audits and penalties for false accounting. Not perfect, but neither are current tax collection regimes in cash economies.

@_date: 2012-06-15 07:34:53
In theory transaction fees will be an adequate reward for miners. I'm not so sure... I think there is an issue here yet to be resolved. But we're talking about some point in the 2030s. Public service mining also seems feasible to me if the Bitcoin economy becomes important enough.
@_date: 2012-01-08 18:24:02
If transactions of this magnitude were conducted through Bitcoin, it would hugely stabilise the Bitcoin exchange rate and somewhat peg it to the value of oil. But I think it's only feasible to make transactions which are a relatively small proportion of the total value of all Bitcoins.
@_date: 2012-02-13 14:00:44
I don't believe Bitcoin is in fundamental opposition with the credit card business model. Mastercard could conceivably offer a card denominated in Bitcoins.
@_date: 2012-06-06 19:44:06
You're not wrong, but you're talking about a traditional retail model. I think there are lots of interesting new business models and uses cases waiting to be discovered that will happily work around the price fluctuations in order to extract value from Bitcoin's other interesting properties.

Some initial feedback:
* Could you add some use cases or user stories to the site to explain what the main benefits are?
* I notice in the FAQ that you are a legal professional and have concerns about banking laws. Do you have a professional opinion on the legality of Bitcoin and related businesses?
* Better not to brag about specific software running your site. I can tell just from what you've written that you would be vulnerable to the recently published hash DoS attack.
* It seems like quite a creative idea. I'm imagining big networks of connected buckets... BUT! Are people going to use it as infrastructure? As a closed source centralized website that holds and handles BTC, you are really going to have to bend over backwards to earn peoples' trust. I know this is still in the testing phase but you will need a plan to be able to remove the following phrase from your sidebar: "the amount of security I am able to provide is limited".
Good luck, always good to see new ideas take shape.

The inflation caused by mining of new coins is approx 35% annually, which doesn't account for the even steeper drops over the past 4 months. This is purely the popping of a bubble and the realignment of the price of Bitcoin to the actual levels of trade which it supports. Growth from here on out will be long and slow - until the next bubble.

This is a shaky translation of a poor understanding of Bitcoin. They want to take control of it so that it can be regulated exactly like the yuan already is? Why not just continue to use the yuan?

@_date: 2011-12-10 19:33:20
Anonymity in Bitcoin is provisional. There are many ways to slip up which will  leak information leading to a possible leak of your identity. To name a few: cashing out into a regulated currency, re-using receiving addresses, consolidating funds into identifiable "holding" accounts, transacting with untrusted parties who know a part of your identity, receiving funds from an address with a known owner who gets rubberhosed into ID'ing you...
@_date: 2011-09-27 19:29:25
The few people I have spoken to in real life about Bitcoin generally have the same political reaction: at first, "Haha cool, smash the banks!", then upon further discussion revealing its anti-centralization tendencies, "Huh, sounds like a capitalist free-markets-will-solve-everything scam."
@_date: 2011-09-27 19:49:53
The sticking point is invariably (OK, I put my hands up, sample size is 3) the huge "advantage" that early adopters get. I am personally quite comfortable with this being an appropriate reward for innovation, risk-taking, investment, whatever... but it's the exact opposite of a lot of peoples' conception of what is "fair".

So, not to stalk you too hard, but 13Mog5irj12gZ7cin2YDGQim3jYF7mwCFN is the donation address for your blog (which gives much personally identifying info). Checking blockexplorer shows that 13Mog was an input to transaction 3a28c7c02e0323737a1bf06e2f21e44e9d20105d26d866c99695c9d00f2cb392. Other inputs include address 19AixHmayuinL353TeuDoGTNusUQ2uJB9z, which is clearly your Deep Bit account address (as identified by the transactions received from 1VayNert3x1KzbpzMGt2qdqrAThiRovi8, a well-known Deep Bit address). So there's your mining income. Time for income tax! :)
Similarly I can trace other transactions you have made involving your growing pool of known addresses. Maybe I don't know that a particular address belongs to you, but if I find a payment from it to a known user, I can lean on that user to divulge your identity (and as a government whose tax base is under threat, I am greatly incentivized to use the violence at my disposal to do so).
You are a technically sophisticated user, and you haven't followed your own "proper use of Bitcoin". Imagine a shoe dealer in your hypothetical Italy. Is he more or less likely to leak information? Especially considering he must make many real-world interactions with his customers and suppliers.

Low-hanging fruit: alter the Bitcoin protocol to adjust difficulty more frequently. Say, daily. This will keep the network churning out blocks at a smoother rate, with no downside I can think of.
@_date: 2011-12-15 20:03:01
I'm sympathetic to the cause, but this is a leaning tower of assumptions. Starting near the beginning, Bitcoin does not have the anonymity properties you want. Transactions are fully traceable, and address owners can be identified through information leaks that can occur in the kind of normal, everyday use described. You become less anonymous the more your network of transactions becomes woven into the economy.
@_date: 2011-11-21 20:52:23
It's an online payment system, in the same space as Bitcoin. If people get used to sending money person-to-person through their computer, they will experience less future shock when they hear about Bitcoin. There are a lot of assumptions in play which Bitcoin needs to chip away at, such as: you need a bank to send money, money must have a physical basis, etc..  So I'd say such services are a positive development for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2011-09-28 19:06:02
Sounds like a trader thinks his "human-speed" trades are somehow magical and deserved of special treatment. More likely he is buying when he *thinks* the price is low, then sitting on the edge of his seat waiting for the price to rise, and being disappointed when any rise is sent back down by an automated trade. In short, he is just a gambler, bringing no new information to the market.
A bot may or may not bring information to the market, depending on the sophistication of its algorithm. If so, it has the potential to make gains. If not, it's just a liquidizing price stabilizer.

So would it be fair to say that this metric is the amortization of the fixed costs of mining?
The marginal costs are interesting. Currently they are very low, as the vast majority of the computational effort goes to finding the block hash. But as the blockchain increases in size, verifying a transaction becomes more expensive, in terms of memory and I/O.

@_date: 2011-09-28 19:16:34
I'm not so sure. Imagine you are the US government. You probably control the few links to other countries - undersea fiber, satellites, etc. (likely numbering in mere hundreds). You install a filter at each exit point that blocks only Bitcoin traffic. The US is then on a separate partition, but it's hard to notice because the regular internet works and the number of Bitcoin clients is still large. The govt then does some big global double spend and removes the filter.
Now I'll be the first to admit we're entering paranoid territory here, but the 51% attack is usually imagined to be executed by a government, so if we're going to compare the two, let's grant the network partition attacker similar capabilities. I submit that partitioning by filtering is an easier attack for such an entity than building a supercomputer.
The countermeasure is for attentive Bitcoin miners to establish private links to the rest of the world - but would they notice in time?

The idea of a *provably fair* gambling system is a huge innovation, and a huge threat to traditional casinos, who have no way of implementing this feature. Bitcoin is the key enabler.

@_date: 2013-02-16 11:54:41
It's a good suggestion. The free/open source movement is highly aligned to Bitcoin's roots and principles. But we should work on making the Bitcoin offering self-evidently valuable,  rather than having to apply pressure. The word pressure makes it slightly adversarial. Vendors should be accepting Bitcoin because it's the right thing for their business (which in this case it most definitely is!). So let's start asking people why they are not already using Bitcoin, and remove those barriers.
@_date: 2013-03-04 16:08:39
Surely if the price of Bitcoin went to zero, then it would by definition have no value to anybody, and probably therefore deserves to fail and be replaced by something else. What would be the incentive for somebody to provide a backing service for Bitcoin?
