Well, objectively speaking if everyone would just transfer onto BCH from BTC not much of value would be lost. BCH is the same shit. IT's not like some new premined altcoin.

For people sruggling with similar problems, or with gambling problems - before simply ending your life, how about to try a bank robbery or kidnap some politician or something? Worth a try, no?

otherwise instead of this spam you would have 10000000x the spam

If these are miners or acceleratorservices that are doing this spam, it is really stupid, because in the endgame they will be losing out, because they damage the total value of a coin.

well it's easily fixable, just make a hard limit for total network hashrate. Current speeds are overkill.

even with LN spam is sadly possible

The problem is - when the value is 600 fee would be 700 :)

What do they would hope to gain from it? If Both BTC and BCH drop in value they are fucked. I think you are wrong about those.

Kidnapping a politician would allow to extort money from him or his relatives. Bank robbery can be less difficult, depending on the bank and amount of money you want to steal.
You can always suicide later, in prison, why not try something drastic?

Bitcoin is too good to be true. It goes against government interests, and in the end it will be defeated. Even if you decentralize it to the max, and move servers to the moon.  
You need political motivation, and a lot of people support for bitcoin to ever work.  
Not happening in our lifetime.
