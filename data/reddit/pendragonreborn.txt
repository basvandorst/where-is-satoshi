Of course you don't, you don't know us.  However Jeffery Tucker (Liberty.me), Jeff Berwick (The Dollar Vigilante), Stefan Molyneux (Freedomain Radio), Adam Kokesh (AVTM), Nathan Cox (Cop Block), Will Pangman, Julia Tourinski, Sarah Blincoe, Mike Hiese (The Big Plantation), and many, many more do know us, and support us.  Some of them have even gone through and reviewed the tech with us.  
On the IndieGoGo page, we planned on listing all of our endorsers and supporters, we just didn't have time to get them out now, this weekend.

Everybody is still thinking old school, and not like bitcoin.  I keep seeing questions and arguments about old tech, but no body is applying new blockchain layers to it in their minds.  
"Suppose I get remote code execution."  
Suppose you color a bitcoin any which way you want, does that make other coins yours?

I wasn't listing them as security experts, I was listing them as friends, who know we wouldn't "Take the money and run."

thanks, any idea on howto get us some more traffic in the next 7 hours?  the type that will help us make our goal?

That obviously was one of our first hurdles, and it simply comes down to layers of security.  The types of jails you are in, the type of encryption we are using.  May I ask, have you ever seen this meme?  And if so, have you ever read it?  If so, I am very curious on your take.

To more directly answer your question though, you are still thinking the way it used to be done, not the way we've re-designed it.  You are thinking shells, and web-servers, not block chains and colored coins.  Sure, we will be leasing dedicated servers, and you could very well take control of it with some sort of root kit, anything is possible, but then you've only gained access to your own data anyways.  Right now, if you have a bitcoin wallet, you have access to the entire public ledger right?  But just because you do, and you can see all of the data, if each coin is colored and encrypted, what stops you from "stealing" them all?  Other servers verifying, what to bitcoin is "mining" to us, is verification.
