I strongly hope we don't. The ECB, fiscal compact and EU agreements is are the only things preventing more debt and inflation..

He had more names than a Brazilian soccer player!
@_date: 2019-07-08 16:22:56
Thanks! I hope to come and visit you at the next meeting! Care to sponsor my trip?

He probably got grilled by cripto enthusiasts...

No, I'm asking ppl to have a look and try to grasp my text with Google Translate (which works wonders nowadays). The text is almost identical to what I say in the video.

Yes, they are leftist, but I don't think it's relevant to this specific article.
@_date: 2019-07-08 15:32:54
Yet this is how it still works, especially in Italy.

Unfortunately Bitcoin isn't really a payment system right now, but more of a store of value. I would also argue that speculation is one of the driving force behind it right now, but the same could be said of Tesla and other stocks with a P/E in the 100s.

I would LOVE to, but  I've a fulltime job and I did this in my freetime. I prepared my response on Sunday evening+night (took almost 8 hrs in researching, writing and recording). I really don't have any more freetime until the next week.
@_date: 2019-07-08 15:30:18
Ahaha, yes, someone  pointed this out on Telegram but unfortunately I already had the video recorded!
@_date: 2019-07-08 15:27:41
yes, it's us! we also had far worse ;-)
@_date: 2019-07-08 15:32:23
Even when you bury it in a 10,000 words contract that nobody is going to actually read?
@_date: 2019-07-08 06:44:19
Agreed! I hope that something like Brave/BAT will go mainstream and a better revenue model with it. I strongly doubt it though :-(
@_date: 2019-07-08 06:42:19
Thanks for your feedback! I truly, truly would LOVE to remove it all (it also slows down the site considerably), but I need the revenue to pay the bills :-(
@_date: 2019-07-08 10:22:17
You caught me. I'll probably get 1 euro or so in the best scenario. Not bad for 8 hrs of work, I'm a criminal mastermind..
@_date: 2019-07-08 18:19:02
Brilliant, it surely is!
@_date: 2019-07-08 18:45:28
Great, thanks!
@_date: 2019-07-08 06:55:36
Thanks pal
@_date: 2019-07-08 18:41:46
Some journalists still do a great job, especially when they move to the state/area they are reporting about instead of copy-pasting from Wiki and tabloids
@_date: 2019-07-08 15:33:08
My pleasure, thanks for the support!
@_date: 2019-07-08 06:48:53
These are also the point I made in my previous article about "[Bitcoin is not a scam]( It looks like I was on-point with you ;-)
@_date: 2019-07-08 18:36:29
It used to be pretty good, but nowadays the quality is waaaay down  :-(
@_date: 2019-07-08 18:38:37
Good points!
@_date: 2019-07-08 06:57:53
I'll try, but I have a fulltime job and I do this in my own free time. Thanks for your support!
@_date: 2019-07-08 18:21:18
The author confirmed on LinkedIn that he was referring to Bitcoin. Plus, he is a fund manager and an engineer, so I'm confident he can tell them apart
@_date: 2019-07-08 06:55:06
Right on point! I'm doing my best to. Ciao!
@_date: 2019-07-08 16:19:18
Reaching out to my followers on YouTube and on my site is easy. I'm also talking to ppl in my local community. My problem is that I'm unable to reach all the other no-coiners, who are most at danger from article like this.
@_date: 2019-07-08 08:21:03
No, I didn't... but I'll do it right away, thanks for the tip!
@_date: 2019-07-08 15:33:27
Glad to be of help, thanks for the feedback!
@_date: 2019-07-08 08:19:47
I'll try, thanks for the tip!
@_date: 2018-05-19 15:15:45
Upvoted like there is no tomorrow :-D
@_date: 2018-10-30 06:19:52
I'd still bang her
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:53:12
coindesk is expecting support @ 5k. What's your source?
@_date: 2019-02-25 22:00:49
Lure her in, talk about SegWit, LN and scaling for a while, bang her, say goodbye. Easy peasy.
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:05:37
Very well written post, thanks! Good job at selling at 6900, don't be to harsh to yourself. You could now re-buy it with ease at the 4900 $ support I'm waiting for. By your tone you should be... 45 yrs? I'm 35 btw :-)
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:12:15
Interesting price read: 
tl;dr: "the current sell-off in bitcoin is likely to run out of steam below $5,000". Get your wallet ready to BUY.... 
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:56:06
Actually I fear to lose the rebound at @ 5k :(
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:19:51
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:40:48
What's the new support for you?
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:00:46
Me too! Can I also get a BJ meanwhile?
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:23:58
It won't. I've my alarms set to go off at 4900, then... buuuuuyy!
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:31:00
Most of the ppl I read think support is @ 5000. What's your source for support [already broken] @ 6000? thanks
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:57:17
Cool thanks. Where do you go to see bids at pricepoints?
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:30:20
Yes, I did. I was clearly wrong :-(
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:42:43
At this level, yes. I think tx backlog would be slashed by the time we reach 4900, since now it's more profitable to mine BTC then BTH and miners will come back.
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:46:29
Guys, any new TA for the target? I'm hovering on sell (will buy even more on the next dip), but I really don't now when to shoot
@_date: 2019-04-04 08:59:35
So you're a millionaire, right?
@_date: 2019-04-04 12:18:59
And then we wonder why ppl doesn't spend crypto as currencies...
