Which is basically everything ever written about Bitcoin ever.
@_date: 2014-03-03 19:44:32
If the vast majority of the price is from speculation, then it is backed by speculation. You're just in the wishful thinking zone.
@_date: 2014-02-09 04:52:13
Because of nebulous things like not having the fed mess with it and outright lies like total anonymity. Also crime if you aren't paying taxes on BTC transactions and assets.
@_date: 2014-03-03 17:40:09
It is backed by something: speculation. Which is to say that it's backed by the belief that it will be worth more in the future than it is now.
And that's why I believe the whole concept is doomed to failure. Almost eery advantage BTC supposedly has over normal currencies is either an exaggeration or an outright lie. It isn't anonymous unless you managed to acquire your coins outside of an exchange and never buy anything that gets shipped to you nor otherwise has identifying information associated with the purchase. It isn't free of fees because, unless you mine it yourself, you're always paying an overhead cost to buy the BTC in the first place (and there aren't many places to spend it you can't just spend regular goddamned money at!). The only part that is actually mostly true is thag it isn't controlled by a bank or government (unless you count the mutual consent of the people developing the clients every time the protocol is updated). Well done that, except no regulation also means no real protection... Not to mention that its deflationary value, combined with being backed by speculation, encourages hoarding rather than spending.
While I am rather surprised it ever got as high as it did (and might well again before its all over), it still seems to me to be little more than an out of control penny stock scam.
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:54:27
Which is exactly why I didn't get into bitcoin back when news about it was first making the rounds at places like Slashdot and annoying the fuck out of everybody.
It grew more ridiculously than I ever predicted, but ultimately I still can't help but see it as a scam that will one day collapse to irrelevancy. We may have started down that road today.
@_date: 2014-02-14 03:11:51
That's what happens when your currency is backed entirely by speculation.

I think the get rich quick crowd has started to move on, which is part of the reason doge is picking up.
I am definitely not a true believer in cryptocurrency, and I'm tempted to throw a lot of money into doge just because it might take off like BTC did under the right circumstances.
@_date: 2014-02-09 04:50:26
Because ultimately, why? I can spend that $20 on what I was going to buy with the BTC and not have to pay a third party to handle the conversion.
The only way buying BTC makes sense is if you want to hold it because you expect the value to rise.
@_date: 2014-03-03 17:40:58
Why would I cheat the protocol when I can just cheat the people and there's no such thing as a chargeback?
@_date: 2014-02-04 03:12:47
It hasn't reached the moon yet, so it's potentially much more profitable as an investment and, unlike other altcoins, has a significant following here on reddit to keep it going.
@_date: 2014-03-03 21:52:31
Alright, that's fair. Though I contend that Bitcoin's usefulness isn't and probably never will be very much.
@_date: 2014-03-03 17:51:30
Cash, no. And that's why cash scams are still popular. But nearly all digital forms of payment (which is what BTC is) have protection mechanisms. BTC has none.
So like I said, why cheat the protocol when I can cheat people?
@_date: 2014-02-04 03:28:18
I disagree. I think that ultimately it will be a footnote in the history great investment scams. In that sense I guess you could say I'm the opposite of a true believer really, a true doubter.
I think dogecoin's success is a part of that. If you weren't in BTC early on, you're looking at cents/coin turning into $1k/coin in a few years and wishing you'd got in on that.
Of course you could get into BTC now, but it's too late isn't it? Isn't much more moon to go to. Ah, but here's another currency, and it's gaining popularity...

There was a thread recently where ASICs were discussed and it seems that even they are probably not profitable at the cost they're being sold to consumers. IIRC they were just slightly worse than buying BTC directly.
If you're looking to profit off of mining your best bet is to try and buy shares of ASICminer or something. If you're looking to invest in bitcoin you can just buy coins. 
However, if your goal is to just get some coins that aren't traceable to you easily then ASICs will probably give you the least overhead.
@_date: 2013-05-31 18:44:56
I can get about 140MH/s with my videocard, which earned me *maybe* 4mBTC/day. So if the math holds then you're looking at *maybe* 9.5mBTC/day which is about $1.2 currently. Of course you have to balance that against the cost of electricity, but that should be pretty tiny for ASICs.

No, my math was for a single ASIC at 330MH/s based on what I get at 140.
It looks like he has 36 cards, so that'd be about $43.2/day with that rig, minus power costs.

"You can't meaningfully secure a windows computer"
Ugh. Windows is just as securable as any other operating system. Saying otherwise makes you look like a PFY from the 90s. The only reason Linux seems to have a better security track record is that it isn't used nearly as often as a desktop OS, so it has fewer targets and fewer idiots using it. It is just as easy (more or less) to slip a keylogger into your Linux account as it is your Windows account.
Security is a *process*, not a feature of software.

Money not backed by *something* is worthless. Government currencies are bacled by the government's acceptance of them (kinda like a coupon really), bitcoin is backed by speculation, bottles of vodka and packs of cigarettes are backed by addicts. AnxietyMan's Imaginary DollarPound is backed by nothing, because even I don't believe it has value. 
So I guess what I'm trying to say is that there really isn't anything that doesn't have its value backed by something. Except AIDP of course.

@_date: 2013-12-19 04:53:12
I'm not anti-bitcoin, hell, I've even made some money on it, but I do ultimately believe it is little more than a fancy pyramid scheme that will one day collapse in upon itself. With that in mind, I urge caution for people trying to make money on it since I believe it's basically just gambling with when the big collapse is going to happen.
If I'm wrong, I'll accept that. Wouldn't be the first time. But so far the major interest I see in bitcoin is people looking to make a money by riding the waves, and very few people actually using it as a currency. That doesn't spell long-term viability to me.
@_date: 2013-05-29 15:02:54
Possibly, but I'm still right. Find me an early miner who gave all his BTC away. That'll be hard because I doubt any did that. They saw a future in bitcoin and decided to put some time and money into it. If that future came true they make some money, if it didn't they lost some.aybe they didn't dream that it would pay off as much as it did, but they certainly didn't do it because verifying silk road transactions gives them a warm fuzzy.

My money --not literally-- is on a temporary recovery before another large dip (after which it will recover t o a price around $50). If it goes as low as $10 (unlikely) I might pick up a few just to have around in case it ever becomes useful or practical, to me personally, as a currency. Otherwise, oh well. It works just as effectively as a currency transfer medium at $150 as it does at $1. Though maybe not quite as stable as TF2 items.
Of course, this is all complete speculation and possibly also fantasy. 
@_date: 2013-06-02 21:35:17
Probably not unless you can make your own. A company making them is more inclined to use then if they're that profitable, rather than sell them, so they'll sell them at a markup that makes them at least as, if not more profitable than keeping them.

Is that right?
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:25:37
Or selling something in their currency. I have a large collection of crap I could theoretically auction off for bitcoins.
Granted, exchanges are always going to exist, but the real problem with bitcoin right now, and why I can't take it seriously, is that the exchanges seem to be the *only* use for bitcoin. Buy low, hope for a bubble, sell before the big bang, walk away with money in some other currency. Hardly anyone is actually using the things for anything else.

Bullshit. My estimated return with my "decent graphics card" was about 6mBTC/day IIRC, and during that time anything more than standard windows usage was impossible. I don't even want to know what running that constantly would do to my power bill, in terms of the juice wasted and the cooling, and I can't imagine it being a net gain, let alone an economic one.
So at the very least you probably need a second computer with at least as much power as your main rig just so you can play the games you bought that beefy graphics card for in the first place. And that'll still be a paltry amount of BTC, with ever increasing competition for it.
Edit: seriously? Outright insult me and then claim "no offense intended?". Fuck you.
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:45:11
The primary hurdle to BTC adoption as a currency is the same thing that gives it value in the first place: speculation.
I'd like to use bitcoin to buy things, but the value of a bitcoin isn't even remotely stable, so anyone selling and buying in BTC is just taking the current market value and converting to BTC. No one is actually valuing things in BTC directly.
And that volitility means that, at best, I can use BTC as a transfer medium. The only incentive to hold BTC is speculation, and the only reason it has any value is speculation.
So if I'm not a speculator, why woukd I want to use BTC in the long term?
Edit: I only now realize I misread your post and so mine doesn't really apply,  but it took a long time to type out on my phone so I'm leaving it.
@_date: 2013-05-23 17:46:03
I don't see what part of this you're not getting. If you have to buy another computer in order to mine coins, that's a loss. Even at .01 a day you're looking at a year or more to recoup that investment alone. And that assumes that the value of BTC remains high and new competition in mining doesn't drive your meager profit thrpugh the floor.
If you're using power you would otherwise not use then, all else being equal, you're power bill will go up. Sure, if I change around the way I do things I can keep my power usage the same, but if I do that and don't mine then my power usage is lower.

@_date: 2013-05-15 01:28:57
I believe what was meant was that if this is part of a larger trend towards a crackdown on BTC-&gt;USD exchanges then a lot of the reason to have bitcoin will go away. 
All those vendors that started accepting it will probably drop it when they can't get USD to pay their bills, a lot of the speculators go away, etc.
In short, demand will dry up and BTC will fall in price dramatically.
Whether or not that's what's going to happen is a matter for speculation.

Even taking into account the smallest possible division of one BTC, that's nowhere near infinity.

Everyone is in to bitcoin for personal gain. Why would you use bitcoin? To get away from fiat right? To get away from fees and taxes and inflation and government control. That's not something you're doing out of the goodness of your heart.

Even as a not-so-early adopter you can play the market because its ridiculously volitle.

A) You have a shitty bank.
B) It remains to be seen what the transaction fee will be like when the coins are all mined.

No, but the same is true of any vendor.

Eh. It was always and still is a gamble, just like any other investment.

Won't the transaction fee have to be pretty high to offset the computational cost?

Sure you can use your normal computer, but that either means only mining when you're not using it for gaming and whatnot, which decreases your income, or giving up gaming and whatnot, which is quite the sacrifice. 
I stick by my assessment that it's a poor way to get bitcoins unless you're willing to get really involved with it.

Ok, but they still have the other problems. How can they prove someone else didn't set up the account with your card? How can they prove you actually recieved what they sent? etc.
These are not new problems.
