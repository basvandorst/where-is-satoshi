&lt;hrumph&gt; in chat said " i want this to be referred to as a proposed *account-holder* buy-out not a customer buy out.... our primary relationship with gox right now is as account-holders... not service users"

gox is very profitable up &amp; running, just need to remove the goxing 
@_date: 2014-02-28 16:10:52
The plan would mean gox isnt gox like before, no mark k, no bs, open source.

We could use your expertise in helping work out the details i think if thats at all possible. I just made this account i want to be involved in this.  
The brand can be turned around, im thinking of fulltiltpoker, the situation is very similar.  
I would hope with customers as shareholders they would have an interest in newgox.com success.  When the exchange mcxnow first launched fee shares everyone who bought seemed to be promoting that site which did raise the customers &amp; fee share values. (site turned out to be a little shady but thats a different point)

word on the street is gox will be reopening
