According to my understanding, he had a primary wallet that was indeed locked and encrypted, which the FBI has still been unable to access.  There were other wallets left open on his laptop that the FBI was able to steal.

Not to make sweeping generalizations, but a decent percentage of bitcoin supporters are free-market capitalists that don't believe selling marijuana or other drugs should be illegal in the first place. 
This 'criminal' use of bitcoin is only an excuse for the government to try to stifle it as they have.  The real problem is that it threatens their fiat funny money.  If they don't have the bitcoin-drug association, they'd surely just find the nearest strawman use-case and base their propaganda on that. 
tl;dr:  Hatas gon' hate. Let them hate.  Move forward in spite.

It's not actually a bummer in the end.  He's happier than he's ever been living as an expat.  The world is so much bigger than the USA.

From dictionary.com "Theft:  the act of stealing; the wrongful taking and carrying away of the personal goods or property of another; larceny."
To take someones money by gunpoint and violent force is indeed theft.  The costume you wear while performing the act does not change what it is.  The fact that it is sanctioned by an unjust and illegitimate system of laws does not change what it is. Calling it confiscation is merely a euphemism.  
P.s.  We're not talking about the confiscation of illegal items, though, it should not disqualify this as theft.  We're talking about federal reserve notes.  Where is the line drawn between confiscation and theft?  Can they take everything you've ever owned?

Let's do research and think before we start randomly declaring honeypots.  Let's think here, the article is simply encouraging people to use bitcoin anonymously.  What's the honeypot?  Bitcoin itself?  
Otherwise, there's 5-7 years of content you can go through if you doubt Nevergetbusted's legitimacy.

Thanks man, that is exactly the answer I was looking for.  I thought this auction was for 'the big stash' that they previously were unable to access.  Without hearing any word of him giving them the passphrase, I was at a loss.
