I'm not sure what you're arguing. I think you picked a straw man to try and argue against. Just for the record, that's a logical fallacy.

What are you asking? Tips for what? Tips on securing your investment? Tips for investing further? Tips for "owning" Bitcoin?

They weren't stolen, they were lifted while being transferred between the site and your computer.
@_date: 2013-11-28 22:31:47
You can be secure, sure. Not 100% secure, but as secure as is reasonable. This is a really [long] vague question.
@_date: 2013-11-30 14:13:46
Yes. So if your codebase account is compromised, you're not fucked. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 22:38:50
Did you bother checking the Side Bar?

When you're on Reddit, don't be a wanker.

Why would you put it into cold-storage? Isn't that the opposite of the goal? That just proves you *are* in it for the investment. 
Bitcoin is supposed to be used as a currency, not a value store. If you truly believed in the foundation of Bitcoin, you'd be using it buy things. Or you'd be selling things *for* Bitcoin. You wouldn't leave it to sit and stagnate because that doesn't do anything for Bitcoin.

It wouldn't surprise me much. Many people who were around at the very beginning and mined coins probably weren't too careful with their coins. I know I probably had a few coins from mining. They were stored on computers at school and when I graduated I didn't even bother trying to save them as they weren't really worth anything and I was still only in high school.
Also, there's that story of the guy who threw a hard drive into a rubbish bin that had 7500 bitcoins on it.

What is a private key? Why is it important to not share with anyone?
@_date: 2013-11-28 22:39:54
Did you bother reading the sidebar at all? I'm pretty sure 1 minute of looking at the sidebar would answer your questions.
@_date: 2013-12-02 06:49:31
That's reasonable. Very reasonable. But that's not necessarily helping out the Bitcoin economy as much as it would be if you were buying the Bitcoins to then trade for things. Moving bitcoins helps the economy. Just buying some and letting them sit doesn't help as much.
I don't know much about economics so I could be wrong on many fronts, but I'm under the impression that stagnant bitcoins doesn't really "help Bitcoin." Does that make sense?
@_date: 2013-12-02 06:35:36
Or use LastPass because it syncs and works on mobile.
@_date: 2013-11-28 22:40:58
What do you mean "is there such a thing as 'secure' on a computer?"
That is a vague question.
@_date: 2013-11-28 22:34:34
Crash tomorrow? Man, I wish I had the same insight as you. I'd be rich if I knew everything before it happens.
@_date: 2013-11-29 00:30:02
It's not arbitrary. It's all psychological. And psychology is a very *real* thing in economics.
@_date: 2013-11-29 00:40:21
The price is still booming. Also, most posts and sites default to USD. Most people in the world also probably understand the significance of the BTC price in USD (including the Chinese).
@_date: 2013-11-28 22:36:56
Yes, but the chance of you mining 1 coin is, first of all, impossible (coins are mined in 25s). Also, the chance of mining a block like that is pretty low.
@_date: 2013-11-28 22:29:04
The chances of you getting a Bitcoin without being in a pool is extremely low.
@_date: 2013-12-02 06:43:36
It's not open source, no, but it's also a lot more convenient for just about anybody.
Also, there's no need to *trust* anyone. LastPass only decrypts your stuff locally. There's no way for "EMPLOYEES AT SOME RANDOM COMPANY" to decrypt your passwords.
TALK IN CAPS SO IT SEEMS IMPORTANT.


Any you're complaining that you don't "control" your data? Get a grip.

1. If there was a way to buy/sell/trade with them in a secure manner, I would. Just use your common sense. If there's a service you trust as a middleman, I don't see what the problem is.
2. I don't understand how this is even a question. A handprint scanner is obviously not anonymous as the goal is to *prove* your identity.
3. If they had their hands on information that was unencrypted, no. If it was encrypted with something like AES256 then I'd consider it secure. I don't get the anonymous part of this question.
4. If you're on Tor and are using a secure version of the Tor Bundle, you're secure and anonymous. Unless a 0day exploits your browser, you're going to be fine. Use common sense.
5. I feel like this is something you should ask your parents. :/
@_date: 2013-11-28 21:37:32
DON'T FUCKING DO IT
@_date: 2013-11-28 22:49:33
We don't. You could say some coins are dormant if they haven't been traded in years, but you never know. It depends on what coins are out there in the hands of people willing to trade. That's one of the things that makes Bitcoin very interesting.

Where's the proof/citation? Why just a self post with no link? (Sounds great but I won't upvote until you post proof.)
@_date: 2013-11-28 22:45:58
Arbitrary compared to what?
If people agree that a single bitcoin is worth $1000 and people buy/sell/trade at that amount, it's not arbitrary.
@_date: 2013-12-08 02:20:56
You mean it's a BTC circlejerk post? I thought we were in r/bitcoin? Isn't this the place to post these things?
@_date: 2013-11-29 00:32:59
Exactly. Better be lucky and get those finders fees. :D
@_date: 2013-11-28 22:43:17
If bitcoin are lost, that just means there are less in circulation. Simple supply vs. demand will answer that question.
@_date: 2013-11-28 22:21:47
Coinbase is the best online place. localbitcoins.com would be your best bet though because I believe coinbase has reached it's buy limit for the week.
Last time, the majority of bitcoin belonged to a few major players and investors with little of it actually being used in transactions. Right now, there are many more transactions that are keeping bitcoin up. IF there were some fool-proof cause and effect here that was measurable, we'd all be rich.
@_date: 2013-11-28 22:44:25
@_date: 2013-11-29 00:33:58
I'd keep your coinbase wallet separate from a personal main wallet.
@_date: 2013-11-29 00:48:26
Gotcha. Yeah, there are a ton of people out there who are full of shit. :P
@_date: 2013-11-29 00:18:25
Yeah, basically 100% to 0%.
Unless you count an owner of a botnet mining pool, in that case, it's basically pool mining but it all goes into one person's pocket.
@_date: 2013-11-28 22:45:15
Not in recent months. Back when the difficulty was much lower (when the network had a much smaller collective hash rate) it was much easier. I remember mining at a time when it was common to leave it up for a day or two and you'd get a block.
@_date: 2013-12-02 01:56:23
But that's all it is, is investment. It's still stagnant bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 05:05:22
you mean :(

No, this is only if you logged in during the time period mentioned. Their database was not compromised.

It's very similar to playing the "Modern" monopoly where everything is priced 1000x higher. Everything is still exactly the same proportionally, but that version of the game infuriates me.
@_date: 2013-11-28 22:24:09
To maximize gains, you have to buy low and sell high. :P
