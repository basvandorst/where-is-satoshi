No problem! Thank YOU guys for getting me psyched about something.

People (including me) said exactly the same thing about Twitter in its first two years. So what? I don't need this, do I... etc.
Also, the constant enthusiasm of the Bitcoin community has more of an effect than you'd think. A ton of open minded people listen to my podcast and I've gotten many of them interested in Bitcoin in large part because random people in the community did such an amazing job of explaining it to me, showing me the benefits, what to avoid, and so on. Better than any bank teller!
Also, although the exchange issues are causing some half-assed speculators major heartache this week, the reality is that any attention (short of Congress outlawing it) is *good* attention. A week ago no one was talking about Bitcoin. Now people are.

wow, thank you! My first bitcointip on here, cool system

This is a great point I was thinking about earlier. I think this is a good move for person-to-person transactions such as buying something off an eBay type of site, or paying for a service. Whenever you can lower the transaction costs for moving money, that's a good thing for individuals.
I think the high price people pay for the 'convenience' of knowing a bank or card company has your back is not worth it, when compared to Bitcoin. I believe in due diligence and people knowing what they're doing. I wouldn't use PayPal before at least reading the FAQs and usage tips, and really the same with this. People likely learn early on that one of Bitcoin's benefits is that transactions, just as with cash, are not reversible. No different from meeting a dude who sells me his iPad and I pay with cash, never to see him again. I better be sure it's exactly what I want, and that he's credible, before parting with the money. :)
edit: Also I know of people who have had PayPal or card companies not rule in their favor when the merchant clearly scammed them, so again, the cost customers pay for the insurance of reversing the transaction is not worth it in my opinion... especially in P2P instances.

well, shit. if you all want to fatten my wallet, I'm not going to protest too much-- 1JWsjwcgeQVmAcAUj8R4afnF5x3xpWPF9F
Btw, my background is financial journalist and tech entrepreneur. Been a bit sidetracked the past year raising awareness for NDAA, CISPA, and SOPA-style activism but 2013 is definitely the year to get people aware of alternative ways of transferring wealth.

again, I think we're still in the phase where the public is trying to decide if BTC is worth everything or nothing. If likely as a major Internet currency, every BTC *should* be thousands of dollars, and then may eventually stabilize - in any event, users will only need to stay in BTC for seconds before jumping back out into a local currency.
And if I'm wrong (as I could be), BTC is worth pennies... just some value as a novelty.
The market's 'conversation' over whether BTC is priceless or pointless is occurring in a much more chaotic way than it should due to denial of service attacks, incompetent exchanges, etc.

I hope other independent content creators take this route to encourage new people to try out Bitcoin. Let me know what you think of the cover! :)

good reporting.

and also, the changing .wallet file is not necessary to save and backup then? Just the private key itself?

I think Bitcoin would lose credibility only if the blockchain were hacked and disabled. When there's a stampede at a Walmart on Black Fri, we don't go 'the US economy has been hacked! SELL SELL SELL, the *system* has lost all credibility.'
These exchanges are run by people who don't know what they're doing. I guarantee you within 6 months an exchange will emerge with the funding and technical ability to do it right.

I didn't realize it's not OK to post your Bitcoin address at the bottom. I've seen people on bitcointalk do this, I've removed my Bitcoin address from the posting above. Thx for letting me know!
@_date: 2013-04-09 16:05:17
OK, thanks! So my private key stored on a thumb drive (it is encrypted with a password, chose that option within Multibit because it said it's recommended), along with a text file explaining that the export key is for the Multibit client, providing the password to decrypt the private key, and my public address for convenience's sake should be enough to allow a friend or family member to use the balance if something were to ever happen to me, right?
Thanks for your help. :)
@_date: 2013-04-09 03:16:22
no worries! :)

Bitcoin usage and awareness have increased dramatically. There will be massive first mover advantage for the first global digital currency that a) remains decentralized and b) can't be gamed (no 'double spends').
A payment system no one uses or wants to use is indeed useless. I think we are seeing, as one person put it, something similar to the amateur early years of Twitter where there was always 'failwhale' network problems. Today Twitter is reliable and one of the major social media nets.

That's also interesting to look at BTC's transaction volume. Thanks for the idea.
Although I still think market cap has some validity as a way to discuss future growth potential: you need to be "in" Bitcoin to be a part of the network, as opposed to another currency, and I think many users once they get used to it and enjoy using the platform will keep much of their money in Bitcoin for convenience's sake.
