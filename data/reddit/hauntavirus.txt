Then once you get comfortable start looking into your husband's bitcoin holdings.  Would also recommend that you do not post how many coins you have.

Very good, I drink it quite often... even before I knew I could buy it with btc.

I'd recommend to start buying your own coin(s) or fraction of coin and begin getting your hands wet with a small investment.  Start looking into how to buy your own coins or half a coin or a quarter of a coin or one-one thousandth of a coin.  Get familiar with hands on use, transactions, wallet management , etc. Take things slow.

Thank you! In the states.  Minnesota to be more precise.  Liquor store called Elevated Beer Wine and Spirits.

Makes sense, but didn't MtGox halt then announce that the system needed to be in a static state?  Makes sense to do this. Since if the announcement came first then it was cause exactly what you mention i.e. sell off and movement to cold storage.
Perhaps movement on other exchanges?

haha, sorry.  Elevated beer wine and spirits, in Minneapolis MN.  Heard about it from here on Reddit.

Fancy beer can holders / yokes.  Replacement for ring style can holders.  Better for the environment would be my guess.

New to bitcoin.  Can someone explain what (if there is one) the correlation between the second spike (around Feb. 7) in days destroyed and the price drop / mt. gox issue.  Couldn't help notice the price drop started around the same time the spike occurred.
Edit:  date of second spike
