Yeah, but 1.5% in 24hrs is not noise

Bitcoin is not quite the same as the stock market.    
    
But I get your point.
@_date: 2017-02-23 17:18:13
Yes, not meteoric as such, but a rather fast jump.    
    
As much as we hate big drops I am also not a big fan of big jumps.
@_date: 2017-03-17 07:05:36
Yep, I agree...
@_date: 2017-03-17 03:44:29
I wonder what this latest drop is all about.    
Brexit (the queen made it a little more official)?    
UK Banks (closing fo accounts)?    
BU/BTC infighting?    
@_date: 2017-03-17 08:16:57
@_date: 2017-03-17 04:57:27
What is currently happening is not really 'talking', more like school yard fighting.
@_date: 2017-03-17 13:09:58
No, not that bad at all, just a strange, unexplained drop ...    
I tend to get worried of drops I cannot really explain.    
@_date: 2017-03-24 19:46:16
Sorry, can someone EL5 what this is supposed to mean?
@_date: 2017-03-17 04:08:22
On the plus side, at least we are talking about something else than BTU
@_date: 2017-03-17 13:08:13
BTC (core) wants to go one way and BTC (Unlimited) wants to go another.    
Unlimited doesn't want to create a new coin as BTC is by far the number 1 coin.    
To me, the real problem is that, Core and Unlimited are calling each-others names rather than actually fixing the problem(s) at hand.    
@_date: 2017-03-17 08:20:02
Actually, to counteract this I went and bought some ETH, so that price will now drop and in turn BTC should shoot right back up... 
@_date: 2017-03-17 04:09:48
Possible, but what made them all decide to sell, and why now?...    
    
Maybe it is just a market correction?
@_date: 2017-03-16 07:03:59
Would you say there is no need to do it at all?    
    
Or does it help Bitcoin a little at least?
@_date: 2017-01-13 06:47:55
Not really a bitcoin question, but why do you say that the YEN is screwed?
    
Given what has happened to them over the past few years and an ageing population, I think they have sound economic policies that should see them do 'ok' in the end.
@_date: 2017-01-14 08:16:21
Yeah, maybe, but what's the point really.    
    
If I want to walk away from Facebook for a while, I just don't login, I don't just delete my account.
@_date: 2017-01-13 17:09:59
How so?
@_date: 2017-01-05 14:06:16
Not just yet...
@_date: 2017-01-07 10:20:06
Lol, that's funny :)
@_date: 2017-01-11 09:58:02
That's what caused the price to collapse...(albeit for 10 minutes or so, but still)
@_date: 2017-01-01 18:40:02
Kraken has hit $1K a couple of times already.
Lots of sell orders, so it keeps dipping back under.
My guess is that it will settle at around $1005.00
@_date: 2017-01-14 04:48:38
They are not in my country, (yet).
    
And, given my country, I suspect they will probably not add us any time soon...
@_date: 2017-01-07 06:43:24
I signed up, but they don't support my country...
So that's a bit of a shame.
@_date: 2017-01-13 17:12:11
To be fair, I think any government could shut bitcoin down in their countries one way or another.    
    
Usually, china is just more direct about it, but that doesn't mean other countries can't do it.
@_date: 2017-01-05 14:23:02
Says nothing, I guess after a while it doesn't say anything.
But your user page says you have been around for 6 years.
@_date: 2017-01-14 04:36:09
I never understood why people do that, "deleting" your tweets means nothing at all.    
A magic fairy is not going to come around and remove it from all the servers that made a copy.    
    
In fact, it might be better to keep everything and answer any questions they might have. It sure looks better than trying to delete something off the internet.
@_date: 2017-01-11 11:37:56
The next couple of days is going to be a blood bath on the markets.
@_date: 2017-01-07 03:48:31
Ah, I see, thanks :)
@_date: 2017-01-05 14:19:28
:) I know, that's why I said it.
@_date: 2017-01-18 17:52:28
I know, you were :)    
    
But if Trump wants a Nobel Peace prize he better start something soon.

This makes sense, but why would an investor wait for the market to rebuild?    
    
I, myself, have been loving the new price(s) and I have bought some for immediate trading, ( and some for longer term).    
    
Yes, the price might still drop, (as the current drama is not over), but I don't think I will wait for the market to re-build completely before I buy more.
@_date: 2017-01-23 19:54:41
I guess Kraken if you you are not able to use Gemini, (like most of us)
@_date: 2017-01-28 05:44:36
The info is misleading, it is neither Legal or Illegal in South Africa.    
    
I don't even think our gov. even knows about it.    
    
If they can use it for corruption, they might look into it.
@_date: 2017-01-16 04:28:08
I think, if there ever was one, lawyers would be on it like a rash.
Same "Google/MS/Android coin" and so on...
@_date: 2017-01-31 18:26:08
Can't wait for them to start adding the rest of the world.    
    
It feels like extreme vetting to me...
@_date: 2017-01-05 13:56:09
But some see it the other way around, "They are new, don't trust a word of what they say"
@_date: 2017-01-12 06:00:30
Those are pretty cool!
@_date: 2017-01-12 03:44:59
I agree with your projections, but certainly not in "few days or weeks".
    
At best, we will probably be back in the $800 courtyard in a few days, but even that's a stretch.
@_date: 2017-01-13 17:38:45
A few...
@_date: 2017-01-04 14:56:25
@_date: 2017-01-17 09:09:41
On paper, yes, but in reality China will never allow it to happen.    
    
There will never be a "bubble burst", they will pass some sort of directive to cover their hind at best they can.    
    
Of course, we might see a bit of a dip in their market and some sort of adjustment, but not a bust as we understand it.
@_date: 2017-01-12 07:15:07
Fair point.
@_date: 2017-01-05 12:34:15
I would have thought that ~1150/1200 would be a nicer holding point for a while rather than 1050/1090.
I don't like been so close to $1000, those kind of so called 'milestone' make people edgy.
@_date: 2017-01-14 14:41:15
Of course, but they could make it so hard that not one wants to use it.    
    
Cigarettes are a good example, not illegal, but heavily taxed.    
    
Gambling is another one that would do much better if it wasn't for the taxman/gov
@_date: 2017-01-18 16:56:22
Quite a few actually, Saudi Arabia for example, they have a lot of oil so they might need to be 'liberated'.
    
You also have the smaller oil producers that might need to be 'freed'
    
Of course, if those are too hard, you always have the old faithful 'Africa', so many dictators you can pick about 50% of that continent.
@_date: 2017-01-18 03:59:26
thanks SpaceX
@_date: 2017-01-11 15:11:56
Yes, than can't ban it outright.
    
But countries like China can put serious roadblocks if they want, so can the US as well as Europe.
    
So, while they can't block it 100%, they can make sure the price never rises above $10.00

@_date: 2017-01-15 06:07:08
Has anybody ever bought a meal with BTC?    
    
How does it work?    
I mean I know how payment works, but how is the bill worked out? And tips?     
How many confirmations do you wait for? (It could take 20 or 30 minutes before the payment is done).    
@_date: 2017-01-07 03:42:19
How so?
@_date: 2017-01-12 06:53:04
If I was new to investment, maybe not.    
But investors will see an opportunity once the new has passed.
    
So why not jump on the low prices now?
@_date: 2017-01-14 03:48:00
Piracy is banned, it doesn't mean it doesn't exist.    
    
Cigarettes are not banned, but governments are cracking down on it.    
    
Bitcoin could be banned, it doesn't mean it will disappear, same thing with drugs, gambling and so on.    
Either way, if they want to ban it or just crack down on it, they can, just as easily as China can, China just gives less of a shit about doing it.
@_date: 2017-01-05 13:41:09
Yeah, it is all over the place now, so it is a bit hard to say where it will land.
But I still think it is hovering around 1K
@_date: 2017-01-18 03:57:35
There are many ways, pass a law forcing Chinese to buy properties and sell houses older than 'x' years old, or the central government could put a halt to all constructions and buy everything, (and selling it once there is demand again as they would have stopped constructions). They could even just lie about the extent of the crash.    
    
The point is that China controls the media, finances and people, so they can pretty much do as they please.
@_date: 2016-12-16 08:20:35
Well, it is not as bad as wesellcrypto, they are at ~15%, (and at one point they were closer to ~20%)

I hear you man, I have been exchanging my Rands for BTC for a while now.  
Of course, I can't do a lot, but I do a little every month, I just hope the country won't explode before I have saved enough.  
It is not a lot, but the Rand is going down the drain at a rapid rate so BTC is a long term investment for me
The main advantage of BTC for me is that the government can't steal it from me, not doubt they will steal everything else.  
When, (not if), I have to run away with nothing more than my passport and a flash drive I hope I will be able to start a new life somewhere else. 
@_date: 2019-01-10 19:47:48


You mean in case I return?
Or in case I lose everything at least I know my coins are somewhere in the world? 
@_date: 2018-11-15 19:48:37
It's a bit of a convoluted story.
Most of South Africa was empty land, no one lived there for a while apart from the San people, ([
When the Dutch arrived at the cape they didn't really know there was anybody around.  
The Zulus on the east coast of Africa took land from other tribes, (Xhsosas and so on), but for the most part, there was nobody in-between.  
So there is an argument that, if anybody should get their land back, it's the San people, everybody else, Blacks or Whites got if either by wars or because no one else was around.
@_date: 2019-01-10 19:46:17
I am guessing the extra 2 are in case one of them does not arrive?
Trezors are not cheap, but I guess it is worth the expense depending on how much I manage to save.

I am not familiar with ZelCore, I will look into it.


@_date: 2019-01-11 06:32:49
In principle, of course, but it is not that straight forward.
@_date: 2019-01-10 19:43:46
Hum, that sounds like a good plan.
I was under the impression that RAR files could be broken rather easily, but I guess I could email it to myself or leave it in the cloud.
Anybody would have to break into my email+rar file to know what it is for.
@_date: 2019-01-11 06:35:00
Yes, I will almost certainly do that.
I am more asking for 'worse case scenario' kind of ideas.
Some authorities are not above confiscating devices if they think they are trying to take funds out.
While I have not heard of such a thing, in 5 years time it might be a lot more common to scan drives, (for example).
@_date: 2017-09-16 05:33:42
While true, many countries got smashed, you have to admit that just about every economy after WW2 had a fairly good boom for the last 70 years.
In fact, even countries that either never really took part or only arrived when everything was pretty much done and dusted have done well.
@_date: 2017-09-16 06:12:28
I don't think it really happened like that.
I think the problem would be how to secure those assets, (even if you trust them).
@_date: 2017-10-25 18:41:09
Sorry to ask what might be a dumb question.
But I am running the latest bitcoin-qt.exe, (0.15.0.1) and I am up to date.
Does that mean I am running a "full node" or do I need to do something else?
@_date: 2017-09-16 05:40:25


Where about do you get such data? I was under the impression that the Chinese stronghold had been dropping for a while now.
Is that not so?
@_date: 2017-07-31 07:17:58
They have been around for a while now, I wish they would expand to other countries.
