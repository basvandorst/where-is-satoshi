My account seems to have been shadowbanned for the post, so I'll repost my reply under a new username:


No, but he was in a position of responsibility to investigate and alert others to the truth of the matter.
You don't just go lending your name willy-nilly to companies to state that you are in an advisory position, and expect to get off scot-free when said company incriminates itself and goes bankrupt.
Antonopoulos no doubt realized this, as demonstrated by his lengthy and carefully considered attempt to excuse himself from the matter.


He is accused of ordering six executions. I don't think these claims would simply be made up, unlike most of the people here determined to believe otherwise (as with how Danny Brewster's innocence was maintained until the very end, remember that?). Plus there's more than that, but I can't recall exactly what the other things were since it's been a while since I've read up on it.
So yes, he's scum.

I realized my reply wasn't visible because my account appears to have been shadowbanned, but it was the same as what Hodldown pointed out.
If you concede that the Bill Gates quote was not in fact pro-Bitcoin and was taken out of its immediate context, then what does your original post prove?
What Gates, Buffett, Shiller, etc. all have in common in what they are saying about Bitcoin is that it may have value as a technology, but that does not translate into monetary value.
In Buffett's case, he put it like this: People use checks all the time, but people don't invest in checks. Checks aren't worth loads of money just because they're convenient and people use them.
