The real question is what is your investment time frame? Cant blame people who want to lock in some gains if they got in this time last year, but if your intent is long term (years like me), use this as an opportunity to build a balanced portfolio at a discount (BTC fell less than alts, measure in satoshis). Get a hobby, and try to sleep. 
A universal truth is market timing doesn't work - missing the 10 best days of S&amp;P 500 over the last 20 years would cost you 1/3 of your annualized returns (including Tech bubble, 2008 crash etc.). This is no different and fear of additional losses will make you miss an epic snap back when it eventually happens. 
I am a fundamentals guy, and here is what I see: 
(1) typical mid Jan tax consolidation pattern repeated over past 5 yrs straight
(2) A maturing asset class - you wouldn't have Futures, Goldman Sachs, JPM, and major institutions investing heavily if it was a fad "St. Louis Fed: In Some Ways, Bitcoin Is More Robust Than Many Fiat Currencies"
(3) Temporary technical pressure from FUD, exchanges overwhelmed with new users, whales short term trading
(4) Family offices and HNW individuals looking at it seriously as a portfolio diversifier
(5) Bonus and tax rebates will fuel large flows in the next 4 weeks, cant tell you how many times I heard "I am ready to go as soon as I get my bonus check" the past few weeks
It will snap back, the question is how soon, as more FUD mongering may deter institutional investors.
