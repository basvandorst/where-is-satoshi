Well shit, I guess I just got really lucky then. Wish it would've happened when they were at $140...
Also, another glitch I noticed: I bought .754 bitcoins back when they were $76 a coin, and Coinbase said my balance was one coin, and allowed me to sell one coin at $94. Hurray for beta sites?

More like "fuck it, I have useless shit to buy"

Just did that, everything came back as zero. Looks like I've never received Bitcoins, even though I did make a couple legitimate purchases.

Yeah it'll definitely take a while. I mean shit, just think how *fast* all of this has grown. This time last year one btc was worth a couple bucks and nobody really cared about them. I got into em around February, bought two coins for $21 a piece (I was messin around with Silk Road), forgot about em for a while, remembered them at the end of march and they were suddenly TWICE as valuable! 
And the rest is history :)
So I have faith that before we know it, all exchanges'll have a way to protect exchanges.

I'm sorry I'm such a terrible person... As a broke ass college student my first thought was "hey, I could really use that money to fix my POS car" not "I wonder what Jesus would do." 
And can you explain what happened when this same thing happened to you? I've googled it and apparently its not a widespread problem...

Why should I have done that?

I remember reading this and finding it very interesting and informative, even if it was mainly speculation. Comments like yours and those in this thread are why I love the BTC community. I've watched this sub grow from meme's to articles like this that are highly
Informative, speculative, and usually based on facts.
So thank you for contributingz

I have done a grand total of zero illegal things thus far. Their site is in beta and is over loaded due to recent Bitcoin interest, and due to a glitch I received free money. As a precaution I have spent none of it, ant it's just sitting in my bank account. And I did email them, but haven't received a reply yet (probably because they're flooded with users reporting errors and transaction difficulties). So hop off that high horse of yours, I mean no harm.

Ahhhh that makes perfect sense. I was thinking it might've been a glitch or something, and I was waiting to get a message from Coinbase telling me theyre sending an angry mob over to retrieve their coins
edit: I forgot to add that shortly thereafter my Coinbase balance dropped to negative 21 Bitcoins. So I had to create a new account to buy any more.

Yeah I had searched for similar cases a few days ago but didn't find any. I just searched again and found one or two, and I already emailed them but as I said I'm still waiting for a reply.

Idk why it isn't already available everywhere! I understand it's not as fast, but I feel like it should *at least* be an option. I feel like advertising this service (knowing your transfers are secure and protected) would entice more people to use Bitcoin. People like knowing someone's got their back.
