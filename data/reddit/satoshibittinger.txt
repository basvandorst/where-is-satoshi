Yes, I have read the whitepaper. Could you please tell me how reading the whitepaper solves the problem of a single anonymous individual holding 10% of the money supply, or why would a government be OK with that. Thanks.

Absolutely. The Bitcoin would be gone forever. With fiat, you have some recourses.

Sorry, sometimes it's hard to tell total lunatic sycophancy from sarcasm on here.

If I tied you to a chair and menaced you with a 5 EUR wrench, how hard would it be for me to convince you to hand over your money?
@_date: 2015-06-16 18:22:23
Sounds like something like Storj and Sia

Not all guns are for hurting people
@_date: 2015-06-30 11:31:01
Good idea. But how would I know that's all you have? Why not just keep waving that wrench in your face?
@_date: 2015-06-16 18:23:03
I'm gen Y, does that mean you are a prejudiced moron whose only argument is to resort to stereotyping?
@_date: 2015-06-18 17:55:16
People here are completely disconnected from reality. Who in their right mind could seriously believe a government will switch to Bitcoin when an anonymous programmer holds 10% of the money supply? that's who.

Great thought. Caspar Friedrich was a serial outdoors masturbator from what I've heard.

By all means let's do everything we can to support piracy instead of just paying content creators. Those fucking assholes need to understand they can't just charge us for any of their work. Who the hell do they think they are? I'm glad to send my money to other pirates instead. That'll show them.

Just. DO IT

It's scary how ignorant and pitchforky people get here. Ya'll look like a bunch of rednecks. BUT MUH TRANSACTIUN!!!
BTC transactions are not reversible. This is why coinbase must take every precaution in ensuring you are you. So their trigger is sensitive. Good! What would you say if your money went missing because Coinbase had lax security measures? I suppose you would be fine with it because at least you weren't asked any "invasive" questions?
@_date: 2015-06-30 10:46:15
Have you ever heard of reversible transactions? It's a nifty technology that's been around for a while.
@_date: 2015-05-30 17:45:46
Yes but specifically? Not just copypasta.
@_date: 2015-05-26 07:44:12
Wow what a completely irrelevant and hyperbolic comparison.

Hey mate, I can't do today but we could do it tomorrow if that's useful to you. PM me

They're not being dicks, it was an innocent joke that turned out to be really hilarious due to this whole sub going butthurt level 99 over it. They're just milking it now, and will integrate Bitcoin as a payment in due time, this is a great publicity opportunity and they show every sign of knowing how to ride one. Goodnight @_date: 2015-05-30 03:22:39
According to this sub any successful crowdsale is automatically a scam, only shoestring bedroom producers are accepted.

Can you explain how StorjCoin is of no value to the buyers. I'll be here all day!
@_date: 2015-05-30 03:05:48
Oh the narco barons should go to jail, but not the person that helped them sell their stock in the most efficient way possible? Why exactly?
@_date: 2015-07-30 14:59:06
There's this hot chick at the bar dude, and there's a bunch of guys around her but everybody is arguing about how to approach her. Do basically errybody just votes and the winners can all bang her at the same time man. Do you have any weed?
@_date: 2015-07-04 14:09:31
I was wondering that as well. What does Augur offer that is more than a betting system?
@_date: 2015-07-03 21:41:47
Yeah dude they need funding to support pedophiles and FPH, every bit helps!
