actually whats happening with crypto is hyper inflation- more coins becoming worth more money will cause an increase in the cost of all goods
also since the crypto is a locked commodity it is not actually increasing consumption, its just locking money away without it being reinvested back into the economy 
so we have a hyper inflating value that cant be exchanged for goods and services but can be exchanged for more and more money
I mean, do you not get how economies work? for crypto to actually cause deflation of general prices it would need to act as a currency and be used to buy and sell products- but its not- and it certainly is not being offered as a way to buy a house or a car or any other real property except in very limited circumstances 
the world has had record LOW inflation over the past 30 years in most of the world- america has had a lot of big issues becuase even though our inflation rate has been in general less then 2% our wages went DOWN more then two percent per year during that same period 
if salaries had just kept up with inflation, like they have in most of the world, then most people would be able to afford housing outside of the most desirable markets- and we know this is true when you compare america to most countries- the issue is not from inflation its from wage growth and affordability of housing being affected by outside investment 
if you want wage growth we should be cutting domestic spending and encouraging the private sector to build more houses with less regulations
bitcoin will not fix any of that

well you are completely ignoring that we have these things called "laws" regulating how and when you can make large transfers of assets
also you are confusing "merchant banks" for "central banks"- central banks are regulated by the International Bank of Settlements for one thing, then of course there is the issue of china- you said that an evaluation of 800 billion dollars in crypto would be the end of banking
Chairmen Xi just announced that the chinese central bank was lend 42 TRILLION DOLLARS this YEAR- not in total, JUST THIS YEAR
when crypto is worth 800 trillion dollars then i will be concerned, of course at that point it will just be made illegal because unless its a fucking space ship to mars it should not be worth that much money

its going good, got 400k in pamp bars all neat and tidy, adding 100k every year to it, been at record lows
2020 trump will be booted out of office and the economy is going to go insane and gold will hit 3000 an ounce and i will have easily 3 million dollars- of course gold bugs like me dont get on the fucking news for being right, we just get to be rich
I am just going to keep working my finance job here in china and moving my RMB into gold and not paying any taxes- but you keep buying your tokens- i am sure it will all work out 
what I love is how fucking RIGHT I know I am to go into gold right now- not one other fucking human I have spoken to is even thinking about gold, which is why its so low, they are all pumping into to crypto, god you fools- so me and the other smart people are going hard into metal- you buy into what people are NOT talking about to make money- you all talk about buying the dip but you are all buying into a fucking inflated market and you are all fools!!!

As we have clearly seen since the 1970's, allowing the poorest people access to credit has been the key to what was and still is the largest mass generator of wealth in the history of human kind
over this period by allowing access to credit more people around the world have been able to buy houses, build infrastructure and get educations that simply would never have been paid for with out lending
The boom in development across most of the world has been thanks to leaving the gold standard and allowing looser lending policies- we see its results today in wage growth in virtually every country on earth and better living conditions- access to credit is what allows an economy to grow, without it poor people do not have access to the money they need to start business, get educations, or even have healthy food, water and communications  
America is suffering through a particularly difficult period because during the past 30 years it has had wage decline that has not kept up with the record low inflation rate of only 2%- this has led the dollar to have vastly over valued purchasing power outside the united states and no power in the united states
you can see that illustrated here with the big mac index 
As you can see, the dollar is a powerful currency in virtually all economies- however it is only weakest in its OWN economy after sweeden
So the issue is not debt or inflation, it is lack of wage growth

@_date: 2018-03-13 17:13:00
again no, you are talking about heritage- which is not actually the legal requirement in either japan or china for citizenship
In Japan you just need to be a permanent resident of a sufficient time and that citizenship can be granted regardless how "Japanese" you are- though there are exams like most countries 
The key issue for japan is a focus on length of time in a single job and property ownership- the reason that japan has some issues is that it does not give birthright citizenship to the children where one person is a citizen and the other is not a citizen, those people are required to take the citizenship of the non-japanses citizen 
- this has caused a lot of issues in japan since not even china does that, china allows the children of multinational spouses to retain their Chinese citizenship 
on to a related to topic, since this is an economics sub- you do realize the declining population of japan is almost directly correlated with their reducing GDP- since consumption is a key requirement for rising GDP and japan began puting in its extreme immigration policies in the 1990's, today we are seeing the very clear fruits of that policy in its economic decline
japan has now had 20 straight years of declining economic growth with no end in sight- a lot of that has to do with not dealing with the declining consumer base
China on the other hand eliminated one child and has made it much easier for OBOR participants to get visas- hence the growth
I have been working in china as a financial lawyer for 10 years, its so weird how much white people on the internet love Japan- the dont even have a homogeneous culture- all the islands hate each other and the cities and the farms and the diet is ran by organized crime- but whatever, keep watching your hentai

until bitcoin acts as a form of exchange it is just a commodity of value and not adding to the economy 
thats facts
@_date: 2018-03-15 16:40:54
well I am not wrong at all so correcting me is impossible which is probably why you cant do it, thats probably why you are having trouble 
dont worry, just say hodl and that I dont "get it' and that bitcoin will stop the jew bankers ect ect ect
fact is its just a fake digital commodity that has no reason to not inflate to infinity, which i am sure is what you want so you can be rich, or deflate to nothing, because it is literally nothing and is based around nothing
Regardless, I will just point out this fact- if a bitcoin is worth 8000usd today and you buy something with it that is worth less then 8000usd you are receiving fractions of a bitcoin as currency in that exchange- that fraction has been inflating since the whole currency has been inflating
so if we have a bitcoin that is worth 1,000,000 dollars and i spend a dollar then i need 999,999usd of fractional bitcoin data- i also need the ability to transfer that data to people at $1 transactions
then if i have given all of those dollars out and bitcoin becomes worth 2 million dollars then all the dollars in bitcoin are now worth $2 and they in turn can create more fractional bitcoins because they HAVE to be able to because they where generated from the initial transactions
thats how the transactions work and why the blockchain takes so fucking long to do anything!
sorry if you find this annoying 
@_date: 2018-03-24 23:38:44
its not complicated to me in anyway- the lender can keep the collateral since I am not paying the PRINCIPAL OF THE LOAN, I am going to keep the money they lend me since there is no method to punish me or collect the money owed
-I can agree to whatever terms they put in the smart contract but the second the money is in my wallet and that money then moves into fiat and that fiat is then withdrawn and moved non-digatially to a different account then there is nothing that can be done- also the website says right on it that they are not responsible to the lender for me just taking the money 
I love crypto now if this is the future- i get to just take money from idiots!
edit- i cant wait to do a deep dive on one of these contracts and really see how broken they are- i mean what is the choice of law? is everything supposed to be paid back in crypto? if so then that is virtually guaranteed to be unenforceable

technically since you can trade in a fraction of a bitcoin then a bitcoin is theoretically infinite since it is just data in a ledger
so its not actually finite, we can always just have more bitcoins derived from more bitcoins

I have never read on the internet about someone's gold being hacked and all the comments telling the person who lost all his money that he should have "researched his gold more" as the solution to the safety issues
so yeah, gonna stick with fucking gold bars that i can insure for loss and theft vs bitcoin which if they get stolen even the people who like bitcoin would just laugh and say "hodl"
@_date: 2018-03-15 16:27:03
except that pizza is actually a "thing' with a finite amount of scarcity- bitcoin if just data, and the amount of data that makes a bitcoin is arbitrary to the people who decide what constitutes a bitcoin or a fraction of a bitcoin
since it is decentralized anyone can just start trading in any increment of a bitcoin they feel like for any amount they want, who is to say they cant or why they cant
Bitcoin is just a set of numbers in a sequence in a ledger, if a say a different set of numbers in a different set is a bitcoin using the blockchain then it is still a bitcoin- and we see it already in use
It doesn't really matter if you say that there are only 24 million bitcoins if they are each worth a trillion dollars and we are all trading in one trillionth of a bitcoin- its effectively meaningless- there is no scarcity to bitcoin, it can never run out or over value to a point where we cant just make a smaller fraction of it
with your pizza we would get to a point where the slice was simply to small to exist- we just would be trading atoms of pizza, essentially how we already trade single grams of gold
but with a bitcoin we can let its price inflate into infinity since there is no limit to how small we can make the fraction since its just an element of digital math
its all meaningless

According to the sub and to testimonials most people put up 30% collateral towards the Principal of a loan amount paid in totality at the start if the loan period, that principle is then repaid via installments
If I make no repayments on the principal then I have a net gain of 70%, losing only my initial 30% collateral 
the lender can not be getting a gift from me- they are by definition of the terms of the agreement giving me more money then I have at the start
-Thats how a loan works lol
-regardless of the exact proportional losses, again I have only just begun looking into how much money I intend to steal from this website, it is very clear there are few safe guards-unless the smart contract can literally prevent me from spending the principle(which kind of makes the loan pointless) it cant prevent me from withdrawing it from the wallet and exchanging it for fiat to use for the purpose of making money- which would ostensibly be the point of the loan- and if that is the point of the loan I can just take the money and not put any new tokens into the wallet that makes the payment 
it seems to me a fairly simple and obvious flaw
right in their faq it says they can only get back whatever collateral you have put up- there is no other device to collect money from delinquent's
-so if I can get even one more eth then i start with i make money

well aside from just the inherent value we put into gold as a commodity- gold is an essential component in the GPU's that we use to make the bitcoins, without gold we cant make computers, and modern computers are actually requiring more and more gold
we can see this in reverse with the price of platinum- platinum prices have been in free fall for about 20 years, several key components the combustion engine required platinum, which helped elevate its price- those parts are becoming less needed and the price is now dropping- traditionally platinum would be more then gold, usually a third more, now it is 10% less then gold per ounce, a very large reduction in price
its these kinds of questions that keep reminding me why people who invest in bitcoin dont know anything- even if everything people say about bitcoin is true, its just a new payment model-there are several cashless payment systems already functioning, and alipay in china is a completely cashless bank that works entirely on mobile that does credit and lending- bitcoin does nothing particularly different then alipay then allow for more speculative investment by miners
until people can actually just walk into a store, open a bitcoin app, buy shit, and leave, its not really anything- and no one on here really is interested in making that happen since that would be the opposite of "hodl" since no one here wants to spend the bitcoins
its all just pointless

There are two measures of inflation- soft inflation and core inflation 
soft inflation is the measure of volatile goods- food and energy are the prime examples
Core inflation is the measure of non-volatile goods- wood, steel, glass ect
core inflation has been at 2% over the past 30 years
soft inflation has been at around 12% depending on your sources and has slight variables on industries due to regulations(eggs doubled due to regulation of farming, not inflation)
@_date: 2018-03-14 23:26:22
technically speaking we have had an economy backed by debt for about 300 years and it has allowed more social mobility then any other system in human history 
Its always the same issue again and again on these sub- america is not doing great right now, particularly white people in america for the first time ever, so all economic theory must be wrong.
Its just not true- America is in decline because of bad policy and bad regulations that have led to low wages and bad job satisfaction- thats the issue- the rest of the world is gaining wealth faster and is distributing the wealth better then ever before, even if they dont have the most equitable governments the money is getting to the people and it is improving their lives
Its hard to live in a country in economic decline, but that is exactly what is happening in america and it is only going to get worse over the next 20 years-because it is really to late for america to fix its fundamental issues- the only real hope would be to cut military spending and put that into domestic infrastructure, but it will never do that 
Not to get pessimistic but the actual economic death spiral for america is at hand, you just dont understand why or how its coming
to explain- currently china is doing its OBOR (one belt one road) economic plan, its like a free trade system but not, it makes china the primary trade partner for the countries that participate in it- one part of it is getting countries in OBOR to take the chinese RMB as their national reserve currency over the dollar- many countries are doing this. This is a big part of why Chairmen Xi declared himself president for life, so that none of his economic polices can be undone.
As more countries take on the RMB the US dollar will have actual inflation- not hyper inflation that will collapse the country- but actual inflation, like 4-6%.This inflation will cause a lot of our military bases to become unaffordable and we will start shutting them down.
As we shut down facilities in Africa and Asia china will build new ones- they have already begun doing it. The spiral is already happening
America is right now exactly like england after world war 2- from 1950 to 1970 england went from a world power to a regional power, that exactly what is happening to america 
our world war was the financial collapse, obama did not handle the recovery correctly and we are not handling it correctly now
so 2008-2028- america will be a regional power, we will still be important and still be an important consumer market, but its over, we are in permanent decline and nothing can fix it

I am a finance lawyer in China, they have banned crypto here and it is being heavily regulated now in Korea and Japan.
You can ignore that there is major issues here, for you this is a religion since you are poor and you see this as your only way out, and it is also very likely there are race aspects to this for you- that you hate jews and are a white supremacist and you need to believe that these online currencies will some how "stick it to the jews"- fact is you are on the bottom of a very large pyramid scheme.

@_date: 2018-03-14 22:58:26
they are completely different and regulated in totally different ways 
merchant banks go insolvent every day across the world, there is currently only one nation on earth with no functioning central bank (Zimbabwe)- Sudan, Somalia and North Korea have solvent functioning central banks that produce currency and lend money
that you cant see the difference between a merchant bank and a central bank is why I dont trust anyone in crypto- they just lack basic understanding of finance 
@_date: 2018-03-14 00:56:54
It seems to me that you have less of an issue with your race and more of an issue with the geopolitical distribution of wealth favoring western Europe over eastern Europe
btw your description of the Uk makes me think you dont even know about the country you are from, let alone the history of Japan- the UK speaks at least 4 official languages and has 2 regions seeking independence (Scotland and wales) and one seeking to remain in the union(northern Ireland)- Perhaps in the interim period you should consider moving to Northern Ireland, they dont seem particularly interested in taking in refugees and no one particularly wants to live there.
You can continue to be a white nationalist and complain about ethnostates, but if you really believed in the actual genetic superiority of the white race you would move to eastern europe and live among the other whites if that is your priority- i think your priority is comfort and familiarity- you want your dole and nhs and you are just going to complain about it till you die- doesn't make a difference to me

you do realize that going to the 100 millionth unit of this currency would make it the most inflated currency ever possible in the history of the world- Zimbabwe did not get to that level of inflation 
also you are making assumptions about the rules of the network and what will in the future constitute a fraction and who will be enforcing those rules
as we have seen by the incredible amounts of fraud on virtually every exchange I dont thing there is really much guarantee in what is or will be a bitcoin tomorrow vs today- however even if what you are saying is true, if it just followed the math that I am sure you are wrong about because I am sure you are a racist incel idiot, we still would have a virtually unlimited supply of worthless tokens connected to a completely inflated artificial commodity 
@_date: 2018-03-14 22:53:56
Again, that is a purely American perspective on the economy and mostly a christian dialectic on consumption 
Most people would probably have higher job satisfaction in America if their wages had not been declining for the bast 30 years leading to a huge wealth disparity- Job satisfaction is very high in the rest of the world, america ranks very low on happiness indexes 
Without lending most americans would be trapped in even worse economic situations then they are today- renting is nearly in all situations economically worse then owning a home, and the tax deductions on a mortgage in nearly all situations far out way the interest on the mortgage- a far larger burden is the property taxes people need to pay on their homes
As for cars, well we would need a public transpiration system to replace those cars- that would require literally hundreds of trillions of dollars of investment to build- is bitcoin going to build high speed rail lines across america and then metro lines from the rail through the city centers and bus lines though the less populated and then bike shares for the "last mile" issue so people can get to the jobs?
-no? Then either government or private industry would need to lend that money to build it
the 800 billion in crypto is simply not enough money to deal with these issues

I am an economist, I understand it perfectly 
Inflation is when the price of a good or service rises over time in the economy 
right now we are watching tremendous price inflation of bitcoin as a digital commodity due to over speculation 
I think you might have a lack of education because I have been using the term very correctly and if you don't understand its meaning you might be suffering from a severe learning issue
However I just suspect you are very very stupid and dont like hearing bad things about bitcoin
Bitcoin has replaced religion for a lot of young white men- in nazi germany they where called "the unclosed'- the men who felt society owed them more money and status- and thus you see a lot of men like you involved in bitcoin also very attracted to nazi ideology and terrorism- they feel bitcoin will give them back what they are "owed"
unfortunately your bad life outcomes are not because of jews or blacks but because of your bad education and life choices
I advise you to start take pain killers in large doses, you will die very quickly and won't really notice it, its all the rage for the white lower classes today- give it a try!

Japan is just a country full of asian people, it has 5 different ethnic groups and speaks three different languages and one of its islands has been trying to be independent of the rest of the country for 50 years- I dont think you really know very much about japan and just like the idea of what ever narrative about it you enjoy- there are many other asian countries, there is nothing special about Japan except that they supported the Nazi's which i am sure is a big part of their continued fan base
if you would like to live in a white christian majority country that is unlikely to go through a demographic shift any time soon because it is very poor and very dangerous you could always move to the Ukraine- there is also Belarus, Moldova, Estonia, Hungary, Poland, lithuania,latvia, chezk republic, and Slovakia or there is always just russia itself

its also not particularly related to bitcoin- the article claims this man said he saw chinese companies making chips for mining rigs, that might be true, but bitcoin mining and crypto wallets are actually illegal in china
currently the big move in chinese digital banking is that large companies like Alibaba are creating there own digital wallets and lending money as banks- they call this shadow banking and it is a 10 trillion dollar a year business in china
to put into perspective the entire crypto market is 800 billion dollars- so these shadow banks(private companies lending as banks but not banks) are making more 10 times the money then all the crypto combined EVERY YEAR

hi, lawyer here and for fun I just did a little dive on Ethlend and OH BOY everyone here should just start robbing the fuck out of this place
After reading there disclaimers and going through their TOS they make it pretty clear they have no legal recourse to get back lost money
so basically if you are willing to front your collateral to get the amount of tokens they will "loan" you, they will keep the collateral as there only way to off set the loss- this would not be a big deal if they where a real lender that can insure losses, but since they are not these would be real losses so they will run out of money pretty fast
anyway, I hate crypto but I see no reason not to just flash $50,000usd into eth, get them to loan me 100,000usd of eth, sell it back into fiat and when they ask for money i tell them- go fuck yourself, see you in court!
-even if they get a judgement(which they won't) I will just settle it for pennies on the dollar, and my own legal time is free to me and I doubt they have retained the proper finance lawyers to enforce these contracts- since it says right on the website that they are not responsible for losses, which implies to me they are more worried about tech issues then fraud on the loan end
if this is our financial future people like me, actually educated in law and finance are going to have a great fucking time lol

your reason for me not buying gold from legitimate mines and government mints is because it could be fake?
or that 100 years ago personal gold ownership was illegal because we were on the "gold standard"?
You can test gold for its purity in in literal 1 min using 1000 methods, and modern gold has digital encoding right on the bar from where it is mined
I mean you are really comparing the ease of just walking into literal any cash for gold or pawn shop or jewelry store to exchange gold for melt or higher depending on its coinage vs the fact that bitcoin is useless accept to buy more crypto or be turned back into fiat 
again, you can have your digital currencies backed by exchanges that are openly stealing from you and that you have no recourse against when they do- and they do it every single day- on this sub there are daily posts of people losing money from coinbase and kraken on orders- so you just keep trusting that
I will enjoy that I have a vault of actual fucking gold that is worth actual fucking money that I can sell or use as the basis for getting a loan for more money
try to use your bitcoin as the equity for a loan, or as a retirement device- good luck

I really encourage you to read on the global economic shifts- so many people on here are so focused on JUST america and the decline of its middle class that they dont understand that there are larger economic trends at work and that countries like america DO DECLINE- when I say this to people they start talking about hyper inflation or white genocide or world wars and dates that are far in the future- all of that is ridiculous- we are right now TODAY living through the most enormous economic and political shift in power since the end of the cold war(1992) 
To put into a greater perspective-
The world just allowing Chairmen Xii to be president for life is an astounding event- this is something that would have been globally condemned 30 years ago, even 10 years ago it would have been condemned- now its a shrug and back to business as usual. 
-China is now the most stable and powerful economic nation in the history of the world. Nothing like this has every existed. 
A big reason for the chinese growth has also been because it has NOT been focused on military spending, it has had its nuclear arsenal since the 1960's and has basically relied on that to express its military foot print knowing full well that MAD will be a sufficient deterrent to a war- and they have been exactly correct on that- you can look at the current conflict between India and China over control of the nation of Bhutan, china has annexed parts of the country and India has been saber gatling but both countries know nothing will happen because of MAD- hence no reporting and no one talking about what should be a huge issue and another major victory for china in the region as the super power
-we see this repeating over and over again, china investing small inefficient military resources to express its foot print that could easily be swept aside by america or another major power but MAD renders it pointless- so the money saved on the military gets put back into the chinese infrastructure- that money totals 42 trillion dollars a year in lending, making the chinese central bank larger then all other central banks COMBINED(excluding the Federal reserve and the EU Central bank)- this amount of lending is also why the fabled "gold backed rmb" can never happen- the price of gold would need to be able to match that amount of annual lending, gold is currently $1000 an ounce, to match the trillions of dollars in lending by china gold would need to be valued at hundreds of millions of dollars an ounce, giving far to much political power to nations that are not china to control its currency- that would essentially be allowing the chinese to surrender the sovereignty to Columbia because they have more gold, the chinese gain nothing from that and thus will never do it
I can go on with this, and I understand why people love bitcoin- its an opportunity for people with no skills and no upward mobility to possibly make a lot of money- thats it, thats all it currently is- bitcoin can not solve wage issues in the united states, it can not fix global infrastructure issues, it is not going to suddenly overturn the world governments- china outlawed crypto in most forms to great affect, and before you talk about how easy it is to just get around it they just banned having more then 10 expats in a restaurant in Beijing and they are ENFORCING THAT SHIT- so not a lot of people are interested in bitcoin in china these days if they cant even go into an Irish style pub without fear of a police raid 
I try and look on the bright side- thanks to our global economy most things are very cheap, particularly education outside of america, it was very easy for me to get an additional masters of law from a top university in china for nearly free and then use that degree to get a great job, it was not hard to open bank accounts that are linked to american accounts so i can change currency with no fees and its easy to buy products from around the world so I dont feel homesick and VPNs are cheap and effective- and if things in china get worse I can relocate easily to Russia or to the middle east or any other emerging economy since there is a desire for people with my skill set- its the people who are waiting to be rescued in america that are the ones who are afraid and feeling the pinch- just like the bitcoin fans keep saying that everyone needs to adapt to bitcoin people need to adapt to the new economy 
most of our grandparent just came to america from europe with a suitcase and a hat and a few dollars in their pockets, time that a few americans face the facts and start packing their shit and start heading where the jobs are
