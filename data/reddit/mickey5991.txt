It's my understanding that you don't need to start at the beginning, but I could be wrong.  I thought it was just take control of the network and then start double spending (ie. dumping coins on an exchange and then taking back control of the coins once you have your USD)

The real crazy thing is mortgages.  The bank lends me your money to buy a $300k house at 5%, that means over 30 years I have to pay $600k to the bank.  So they took your money and loaned it to me, but they made like $300k risk free because they can always take the house back if I default.

As I see it ... the bull case is 
* lightning network coming online enabling micropayments
* ETF coming online, enabling regular joes w/ 401k.
* geo-political situations destroy various currencies and people seek refuge in crypto
The bear case
* Some Patriot Act type laws trying to regulate the space out of existence
* Seeking to shutdown bitcoin on some global warming / eco pretext
* Any type of hostile government / banking action (eg. banks won't let you cash out your btc to usd
Whether it drops this week or not that's up for the day traders to decide... but I've outlined what I see as bull/bear if you want to take a long-term view

Best theory I've heard is the price drop is caused by the BCH war.  But who knows if the whales like Ver and Jihan are done subsidizing their war?

There are decentralized marketplaces like OpenBazaar (I've not actually used it)
Your generalized use case is "release crypto funds when X condition is met", but you have the oracle problem, of how can we agree that condition X is met in a trustless manner?
