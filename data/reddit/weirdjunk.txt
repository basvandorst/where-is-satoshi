I used to use Coinbase for its speed and since it was really the only one I knew that had instant buy, but the fees are just ridiculous.
I would also like to advocate for Gemini. They have a super clean simple user interface, and they have insanely low fees. I think it's about .25% fee (fee schedule is a little more complicated than just a base percentage so you'll have to do some research into that).
You need to submit identification (ID/passport) and also a bank statement or internet bill, but I was quickly approved in a day. 
Gemini allows you to spend your bank transfer money instantly (while Coinbase requires you to wait up to a week, locking in the price when you initiate the transfer).
Gemini's also like a market. You can buy bitcoin instantly for market value, or you can put in a buy limit order set at a certain price to be fulfilled.
I haven't really found any negative for Gemini, but I just started using it so I would love to hear more opinions about it!

Ok... I've never used Circle before, and all markets have a bid/ask spread.
Bitcoin to the moon!

I feel you man. I've spent countless hours searching up where to buy bitcoins with the lowest fees. 
I live in Cali too, and I started out using Coinbase but the FAT 1.5% fee is just too high. I've been using Gemini now as they have a low fee of 0.25% or something like that (the fee schedule is a little more complicated), and you have the freedom to bid/ask instead of being forced to buy at the market rate. And yeah, the price of BTC in Gemini is often higher, but unless you plan on selling your BTC at a different exchange then I don't really see it as a big issue.
What bank are you using? I signed up on Gemini with Chase and they gave me a $500 initial daily limit, and I don't need to wait for the transfer to complete before I can spend the money.

Why pay a 1.5% fee when you can pay a 0.25% fee LOL.
