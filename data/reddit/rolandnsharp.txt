It would be awesome to get another contributor to the project if you're keen to help :)

I'm testing out the idea. Coding and planning at the moment.

That's not the system that I was trying to explain. A vote would have a set price (say 10cents) and you still only get one vote per thing. Of course you could tip beyond this, but it wouldn't mean that you gave a bigger vote.
@_date: 2015-05-30 23:39:47
Perhaps cap downvoting to some number per day and keep the price low.
@_date: 2015-05-29 13:47:09
Loss of what?
@_date: 2015-05-29 11:29:07
Care to explain?
@_date: 2015-05-30 23:37:49
interesting idea.

Hi again theymos, I'm now wanting to recreate something like witcoin and I'm thinking of doing it as an opensource project. As someone who has experience with it it would be great you get some more of your thoughts on the witcoin user experience and how it could have been improved. Even just basic analytics, like approximate user size, number of "sub-reddits", new posts per day, tipping size, etc. Was there ever a point where some power users were making more than a few dollars a day? Where there major issues with spam bots, and begging? Did it ruin or enhance comment quality in your opinion?

Well I want to use it and I don't mind if the community stays small. It will work if other people also want to use it. I'm just trying to find out if other people are interested.

I'm experimenting with bitcore now.

maybe don't use reddit in the title :) But thanks for the name suggestion though.

I'm hoping there is a slight difference in that you will be tipping someone else to have their opinions voiced. You are still welcome to post your own opinions.
@_date: 2015-05-29 12:06:08
It will have the same issues that reddit does with regards to spam. It will always be "unfair". The user could only give one vote, same as reddit, but that vote is set at a fixed price. The upvote money goes to the person who posted the initial post/ made the comment (maybe it's not a link sharing site, maybe more of a content creating site).
@_date: 2015-05-29 13:10:25
That would be a later project if the initial idea gets off the ground I think.
I don't think it would be possible with such a large database. I would have to do something similar to *Diaspora. And allow users to use their own servers and host their own user accounts. But I think centralised is the best initial option. 
@_date: 2015-05-29 12:58:52
This is true. I was thinking that each 'sub-forum' would set its own upvote price (perhaps democratically) and that some forums could have extremely minimal tip price. I think it could be interesting to have a forum that rewards those who spend a lot of bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-05-30 00:00:10
That's really interesting, rewarding early voting.
@_date: 2015-05-29 13:30:25
I would love it if someone did this. I know some Node.js so I'm using that at the moment. I was thinking that it maybe wouldn't be a link sharing site as it could promote spam. Perhaps a self-post only reddit. So maybe it's worth starting from scratch to promote a more user based system with user followers and such. Not sure there.
@_date: 2015-05-29 13:45:22
bitcoin financially incentivises people to promote bitcoin
@_date: 2015-05-29 13:50:01
I think the system can be designed in such a way that people would be okay with successful bots, just as we are happy with some of the bots on reddit like the 'TLDR bot' and 'changetip' bot, and 'dictionary bots'. We could tip the bots for their service.
@_date: 2015-05-29 11:22:31
Why do people tip? The most common use case of bitcoin is donation. It could lead to an environment where people care more about what they vote on and could gamify the experience somewhat. Wouldn't it be interesting if some users actually managed to make a substantial amount of money commenting?
As for the servers, I would plan on finding the best political location for them. 
@_date: 2015-05-29 12:52:49
That's the primary idea. All money goes to the poster.
