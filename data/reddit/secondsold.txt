Thanks man, appreciate it.

Dell, Overstock, Newegg, and Expedia just to name a few.

hmm, never thought about that, but it is logical and I like it.

What's the benefit of owning so many?  Why not store many coins on less devices?
@_date: 2014-10-17 18:25:51
Good idea.  What is your address again?

True, it's a multipack so all 3 trezors will be shipped to the same location.  Unless you are local, it's probably not worth the discount by the time shipping is paid to ship the additional 2 trezors.

But then you are paying eBay feed, Paypal fees, and shipping costs = break even at best.

ahahahahaha.  Hey, I learned something new!  Who knew there would only ever be 121 million bitcoins??
@_date: 2014-11-09 16:15:24
okay =D
@_date: 2014-10-12 15:06:59
Wow, very cool, nice work!
@_date: 2014-10-18 17:29:29
haha, that's pretty wild.

I had over 1 BTC sitting on the old site before the switch over.  When version 2 was released, my BTC balance was displaying 0.  If you look on BitcoinTalk, there are apparently 500+ BTC in missing coins.  Don't think we'll ever see them again.
@_date: 2014-10-19 16:41:31
Agreed, I can't think of any reason why you couldn't just use the full site.

LOL...classic!
