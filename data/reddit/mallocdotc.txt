I was able to *eventually* withdraw my BTC from one of my accounts for a sum of 1.4BTC. It took about 3 weeks and 2 tickets. The last response I got from them (and on the same day it finally came through) was:










I'm still waiting on the rest of my funds from my other account to come through. I made 2 withdrawals, about 2 minutes apart to the same address; one for 0.1BTC and one for XBTC. The 0.1BTC withdrawal came through in about 12 hours, the other for XBTC is still pending. 
I won't be increasing my account to Tier Level 2 to withdraw anything as I don't see how that would help the issue here...unless they're doing verification checks on withdrawals larger than Y. If the reports are true that they're under surveillance/investigation, it'd make sense that they'd be doing verification checks.

That's spear phishing. They targeted someone to run malicious code. That's exactly what phishing is. It's just that this time the person who was attacked had access to run code on a server that hosted thousands of BTC. That person failed to vet the code.

It doesn't matter what the majority of miners do in this case. The point is that there are protections in place to stop the &gt;1mb chain from reverting back to the =&lt;1mb chain. Minority miners can continue to mine on the &gt;1mb chain without risk of annihilation of said chain.

I was linking to the thread. If you follow it, you'll see Eric Lombrozo's response and attempt to open dialogue.
Your comment on China is unhelpful. People could quote the Vault7 revelations and come to the same conclusion about the US. That sort of commentary is a distraction from the conversation and I'm not going to go down that route.

With only a picture, it's hard to get the full context, but Andrew Stone and Gavin Andresen [explain why it won't revert pretty well]( 
**thezerg1** Andrew Stone - Bitcoin Unlimited Lead Dev 


**gavinandresen** Gavin Andresen - Bitcoin Dev

That would be a good start. At the moment we've got mud-slinging from both sides and it's overwhelmingly evident at how counterproductive that's been. 
Fortunately, Eric Lombrozo is trying to take a [positive approach to opening that dialogue]( in a public forum. This is obviously going to be susceptible to outside interference and bias (by outside, I mean twitter trolls from both sides), but it's an approach that is certainly welcome in the current climate. I hope to see the dialogue open up into something of mutual understanding and a move to end the impasse in a timely manner, in a way that (almost) everyone can agree on.

No, because users won't have to. Miners will.
@_date: 2017-03-23 11:59:52


Yeah, but it kind of is though. It's how business and commerce works. You can't sell your product if you have no way to manufacture it. You'll never get someone to manufacture a product if they don't feel like they're getting a fair deal.

That's not the case anymore. 25.7% SegWit, 23.1% BU, and 7% classic in the last week. 55% of hash power is now signaling for some way to fit more transactions into each block.

When you look at the amount of effort and work put in, the brains in the room and the hours spent, then you come to the realisation that the "amateur shitshow by Ver" is where the miners are putting their money, you have to ask "what did we do wrong?"
It's time people started asking "Why would miners be choosing the BU route over Segwit? Why would miners choose this dev team that keeps fucking up over the tried and true core? How did we get here? How can we be inclusive of the needs of all users (including miners)?"
There's so much attacking and postulating and so little trying to understand what the "other side" wants. The whole discussion has become a counterproductive political minefield and we're never going to get through the impasse if people aren't stopping to ask the important questions.
BU is definitely far and away from perfect, but how have core let it get to this point? It's time they sat down and really tried to work to a mutual solution. You've got two sides (miners vs developers), and they're each saying:
* "I'm not going to bow down to the demands of the miners"; and
* "I'm not going to bow down to the demands of the developers."
Solutions have to benefit all parties within the economy, and miners can't be excluded. Right now, they feel like they are.

And there's the problem. 
There are no terrorists here. Just different groups within the Bitcoin economy looking out for their own best interests. 
Like I said in my post, there's so much attacking and so little trying to understand. The first reply was an attack and added nothing to the conversation.
@_date: 2016-01-13 09:49:44
Holy shit, you do exist and obviously you are seeing all the frustration people are having with the exchange. Why the silence up until now? Why the tight lips on solvency, withdrawal delays, etc? Why no official word from any of you on those issues, but you come out now and say something?

That's [provably false]( 6 of the top 10 pools have mined empty blocks in the past week, and 8 out of 10 in the past month. 
@_date: 2017-05-17 21:12:16
They all do it regularly.
Sure Antpool do it more, but they all do it regularly. Link provided in previous post proves that. Making stuff up in a quest to kill character doesn't. Try using provable data next time.

People are constantly whining about how hard it is to buy Bitcoin, but try buying into an IPO for one of those startups or just shares off the market. It's not impossible, but it's not cheap and it's not easy.
Relatively, crypto has a very low barrier of entry and you can trade as little or as much as you want. There's no substantial minimum trade cost and fees are near enough to zero to have no impact.
This low barrier of entry makes it very easy for mum and dad investors to throw a few hundred bucks into crypto and make (or lose) some easy money. It's not at all surprising that the market cap is surpassing or close-to surpassing some of these successful startups.

No dramas. There are heaps of good dashboards by BTC.com. It's the best dashboard I've found to get a good overview of empty blocks.
Blockchair can also filter for empty (or near empty) blocks:
Last week I'd have said that AntPool were the kings of empty blocks, but it looks like 1HASH are working to take the crown. It looks like [AntPool are finally listening]( and haven't mined an empty block since block [466559]( on the 15th of May. Their empty block count for the last 3 days is [now zero]( I guess with 2-4 BTC per-block in mining fees, the reward outweighs the risk of orphans right now, so most pools are playing ball.

BigVern up and ran with your money. 
There's a [466 page thread]( at BitcoinTalk with all the information known so far.
You can join the class action suit [here]( but this is only against seized assets such as property etc. Most valuable cryptos were not recoverable.
I hope that you forgetting about your holdings there means that you didn't hold much at Cryptsy and that your losses are minimal.
@_date: 2017-05-22 11:55:42
Because the theme of the thread was the fiat market cap of crypto currencies vs the market cap of the above companies. Following that theme, buying shares in cryptos vs buying shares in companies are comparable; the former having the lower barrier of entry.

Coinbase were quite complicit in allowing Perv Paul "BigVern" Vernon to cash out the funds of Cryptsy users to spend on his lavish lifestyle.  
They're now embroiled in a [class action lawsuit]( and are being sued: 








Coinbase may be happy to shutdown the accounts the government tells them to, but when it comes to laundered or stolen moneys, all one has to do is be chummy with Brian Armstrong and co.

They stopped signalling BIP148 about [2 months ago]( I didn't see a statement at the time.
[Bitcoin India]( have been signaling BIP148 in their coinbase for a while, but they haven't mined a block since May 18 (and aren't particularly successful generally).
