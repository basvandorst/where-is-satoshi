Hedging... I like it.

Hmm... lies:


You just co-incidentally happen to like christian charities since every one you list is,  preferably evangelical ones like:
Samaritan's Purse is a evangelical Christian charity
Childfund was renamed from "Christian Children's Fund"
I'll give you a free pass on the older (still all orginally christian)  charities like Sally army etc...   
You're an evangelical christian missionary, aren't you?

Stay far away.

Yeah, but that christian organisation in a vastly non christian country probably does! Their textbook is their bible, they were very clear :)

Are there more than a handful of places where you can use NFC?

Ask them, helps if you are rich but many Bitcoin related business are in their relative infancy now so it could be a bargain assuming Bitcoin continues to grow.

Give money to a christian charity in an impoverished country, for.. alcoholism? I walk past alcoholics in the west every day, it is sad but an odd thing to pick on (maybe it's because they are religious?). I can't stomach people helping the needy in return for religious brainwashing.
Besides, they don't need bitcoin:  "We rely on God for covering our day to day necessities, and he has never let us down."

You said a technology usage feedback loop is a Ponzi scheme, because you don't understand any of this - you just felt like gibbering about a word you heard so you could feel smart.

Good video, points well made.

Don't miners provide other benefits to the network though? Genuine noob question.

What is an XBT?

Ironically I doubt the person they tipped is exactly short of bitcoin.

It's a referral pyramid game based on boring lists as far as I can tell. This link is a referral link (note the number at the end).

They are closely helped by World Vision "World Vision International is an Evangelical Christian Humanitarian aid, development, and advocacy organisation."

I don't think you know what a ponzi scheme is, here  
This thread is all about that you can actually use this currency, not just that people are buying it with the hope of it rising (which is true, but is true of all currency!).  
If you couldn't actually spend bitcoin on real products and services you might have a point.
@_date: 2013-02-17 23:08:16
I think you have that backwards.

I don't understand the terminology but it seems you are asking someone for .5 BTC and if you win 1.5BTC you will return .5 BTC, i.e they gain nothing.
