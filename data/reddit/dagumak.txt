You would be surprised. Banks use a lot of vendors; They have vendors from everywhere including big firms like IBM. They have vendors helping them handle all parts of the tech stack including things like transactions. Most of these b2b companies especially the ones that work with banks, you probably never heard of and never will until you actually have to work with them for any given deal. 
In general, when these partnerships are formed then they are allowed to use these logos especially with banks. They are often subjected to brand guidelines and the partnership can only be publicized if it's mutually agreed upon.

If you're in the finance industry or fintech, this is common knowledge to most people. There is a huge overhead and a lot of cost that Ripple can help cut. The market is already being validated; Ripple has a lot of banks using them internationally. 
Also, if you look at Japan, the payment network that is used by every bank for every transfer including the one that you use to send your landlord rent money is being replaced with blockchains.

It's a technology that has utility similar to a car in the previous example. Can you buy a lambo with those dot com stock shares? 
Those stock shares were in a bubble and the fundamentals were contradicting it because "internet companies weren’t actually making any money yet".

It's probably along the lines of any stock in the stock market or any currency. You need stability for credibility and trust. It's hard to build services on top of volatility. Could you imagine trying to do business on a currency with lots of volatility? 
As soon as Bitcoin stabilizes, it'll bring in a new wave of investors and development. It's hard to imagine a world where you can buy donuts with Bitcoin when you could be overpaying by 20%++ in any given second.

First to market is of importance here. It's the poster child of cryptocurrencies until it fails or succeeds. Yes, there are other similar and/or better cryptocurrencies, but they don't have what Bitcoin has which is exposure and the test of time.

Oops, you're right. I'll fix that!
