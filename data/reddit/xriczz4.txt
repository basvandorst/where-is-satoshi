Looking at the charts I can see a new meme emerging: "Be descentralized!"

Oh yes it is possible, my friend!

I think this Mr SmokeTooMuch had better cut down a bit then, because he's not being honest about his name, for a start.

OP, maybe you know what is going on with their latest release?  I can't find any blog or news site associated with Jaxx.
I downloaded this version Jaxx-v1.1.2-linux-x64.tar.gz
ten days ago, and it seems to work fine.  So today I decided to load it up, but as a precaution to first delete my install and restore from seed.  Now, however, there is no trace of that version on jaxx.io - only Jaxx-v1.1.1-linux-x64.tar.gz 
Any idea why the rollback, or where I can find more info?

Yes, no information on version releases there. I really don't want to bother them with a customer service request for this.  Thanks for the reply, though.
I'm assuming there was some bug in the version I installed, so they retracted it.  Well, I guess I'll just wait until it seems stable.
