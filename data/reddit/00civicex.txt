you can save the bitaddress.org website offline. Your main concern would be if you have any malicious software on your pc that will steal your private keys etc. If you wanna be super safe flash ubuntu live to a flash drive an put the offline website on it an boot from it. That way you know its a fresh install an there is no spyware or anything of the sorts running in the background. Good Luck

There are a ton of videos on youtube that will step you through it. If your from the USA the easiest option would prob be coinbase. You will be required to scan a ID to get verified an your limits starting out will be low. With that said, coinbase comes with its on built in wallet an is also pricey to deposit/send etc. If your wanting to start building slowly as you learn coinbase would be a good start. Although I wouldn't recommend storing large amounts of bitcoin in there. Using a hardware wallet or paper wallet would be more secure for larger amounts. Good Luck

Im by no means an expert but from my knowledge. The 3 best ways to store for long term would be a cold wallet(old pc that doesnt have internet access), A Paper Wallet and then a Hardware Wallet like a Trezor. My personal opinion for me would be the hardware would be the safest and most convenient.
To add to a paper wallet you basically sweep the funds off the wallet back to a live wallet an then reprint a new Paper Wallet(unless you want multiple pieces of paper to keep up with.
If you have a old laptop or pc laying around thats never being used, you could uninstall the drivers for its network card/wifi adapter and use it as your cold wallet. Good Luck
