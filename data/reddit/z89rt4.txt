Obamacare made the prices go up and I STILL have to pay in each month.

I used to have a LOT of nano.  I can tell you why it's not the future.   
1) It's essentially just instant DPOS where the reps vote on each transaction as soon as it happens.  This is horribly inefficient.   
2)The reps hard drives are constantly thrashing due to the above problem.  This simply cannot scale.  
3)All POS(proof of stake) systems have a glaring flaw.  A ton of people keep their coins on exchanges.  This leaves the responsibility of voting and protecting the network up to the exchanges.  Exchanges are far too powerful and vulnerable in every POS system.
4) At any meaningful rate, the representatives will be overloaded or centralized.  Try running a full node  It's awful.  Your hard drive will constantly be thrashing.  
5) Nano devs have not been able to make it work successfully and easily on any exchange.  This is why they haven't moved to many exchanges.  All exchanges running Nano have substantial issues with losing them and false positives on determining if transactions have been finalized.

It was a hypothetical.  Still 100K is very low for operations in the US.

The get benefit.  They just currently benefit from the legacy system.
