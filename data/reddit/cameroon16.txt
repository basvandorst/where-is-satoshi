It would be nice to have coldest climate for cooling, but also have a sustainable energy source. Hello Iceland (geothermal+cold)! Or maybe a makeshift Siberian nuclear reactor

We are still waiting on the ETF, I think demand will increase when that is open for business. Also, I believe the next step for BTC adoption is being used for business to business, or internal business payments. For a business, there are obvious benefits of using the ledger, like writing scripts to read the blockchain and account for expenses or lost funds. Using BTC will be more efficient and cheaper, especially for oversea payment possessing between a manufacturer and a retailer.
Aside from that, I think the BTC market is too large for a purely speculative bubble to spontaneously inflate. We need real buying pressure, then there will be a violent reaction to invest.

The guy is surprised bitcoin gained $10 in one day, haha. What if I told you it could drop 50% a day, or triple its value in a week!

Ugh, I feel like a child in divorce court. I liked thin blocks, will that be added to core?

Fed this propaganda?
This subreddit generously censors and bans any "dissent", even when it is opening a thread for discussion about block size and other forks. All the comment scores are hidden. 
I look at both subs every time I check up on bitcoin/btc, and now each subreddit is an echo chamber of sorts. Everyone in r/btc supports classic, everyone here supports the core devs; but r/btc functions like a normal subreddit. So if I were ignorant to all the inner workings of bitcoin, bitcoin politics, hard forks, etc., I would look at and wonder why the hell stuff is censored and comments are all screwed up.

Send my g'damn trezorrrrrr! I'm scared

Very true. It seems like the technical stalwarts that support core are far from fairly evaluating the opposition, which they did initially  after the Mike Hearn hissyfit. We're in trench warfare on these forums at this point. For laymen (like myself) it comes down to "how important is it that we don't increase the blocksize?" Would core have made a scalibility roadmap if it weren't for the rogue BU and bitcoinXT ? Hivemind here insists that a knee-jerk reaction and increasing the blocksize to alleviate transaction backlog is foolish, but why do they insist it is meant to destroy bitcoin? Whether the devs like it or not, the majority may be a majority of simpler-minded people (even in bitcoin), and we choose our chain.

This is so cool! I have been following (at a distance) Nick Szabo's isotropic wireless transaction propagation project. I cannot wait to finish my degree and get into some free-time projects like this. I have never done HAM though . . .

this math thing keeps coming up... who controls the math? BEWARE
@_date: 2016-11-24 03:45:32
I am a casual follower of bitcoin, but it appeared at the height of the block-size debate (Mike Hearn leaving, splitting off), censorship and thread removal was quite prominent

which purpose? the storing or the transfer?
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:22:48
In the (un)likely scenario that BTC marketcap is so large that volatility is dampened to a reasonable +/-0.5% daily fluctuation, then you can store it easily and transfer it. And in a future where people accept BTC as a stable store of value then they don't have to constantly cash out to fiat.
You're right though, BTC is very unpredictable
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:23:53
What if the utility of bitcoin has just changed? The old ways of getting everyone to use it as a day-to-day currency have faded and it's moving toward another use, like storing and transferring wealth internationally
By the way there are plenty of people in the community who would love to see the whole thing topple, and if you think it's economically doomed then short that shit and make some real damn cash

interestingly enough, Jesus told Judas to betray him . . .

It was in the more recently discovered gospel of Judas

I just wanted to thank y'all, as I was lost and sweating in itaewon (with no wons) a couple years ago and found the seoul bitcoin center! They had beer for bitcoin, an atm (much needed at the time) and most importantly air conditioning! Good luck y'all

The problem is people being the single points of failure, so who can we trust to handle the donations? I don't know if this is too far-fetched, but I like the idea of a variable multi-sig donation wallet. People donate to a wallet and get a number of sigs as a function of their donation size and the donation wallet value. It must be set up to prevent someone from donating a ton of cash and quickly getting the number of sigs it takes to transact from the wallet. Maybe only a select few people can propose transactions. When funds need to be allocated, donating parties will be contacted and cast their vote (sign a proposed transaction).  The idea is just an attempt at decentralizing power in the donation fund with a tweak on a the idea of multi-sig. I am not technically knowledgeable about this stuff, but I think we should be wary of large private funding of bitcoin core development.

I will graduate with experience in materials science, so I am really hoping for some good industry job. 
I do not want to be a post-doc

Cool, I was working on this. BTC is  self-fulfilling prophecy
@_date: 2015-03-30 22:05:27
Upon finishing I will be versatile with programming because of the variety of projects I have worked on. Also, I don't mind leaving and going elsewhere. Hopefully I can make connections while in grad school because my research subfield is applicable to novel memory storage.   What do you do for your fiat now?
@_date: 2015-03-30 01:20:07
Yup, I expect a STEM PhD in a few years so proportionally, I am willing to put more of my net worth into BTC than I would otherwise. I am scraping by anyways, and the money I am saving now will be nothing compared to after gettin a real job.

This is awesome, thanks Gavin. I love this shit! Developers keeping the community technically up to date with important news. Cannot wait for a full write-up
