Giving poor people money directly has been proven not to work several times over now but good luck ����

This is damn near copypasta material. Good job son.

Try using context and your indomitable wit to figure it out then get back to me.

Oh ok you read it, but just missed the important part at the very fucking beginning of the link? It’s literally the first sentence. You wouldn’t have even made your comment in the first place had you been able to understand what you were reading as you wouldn’t have erroneously believed I thought UBI was strictly for poor people. Kind of goes against the term universal doesn’t it?

Did you read the article? It literally says they’re giving the money to extremely poor people. Which not only will be a huge failure, it will do nothing in terms of helping to understand whether or not UBI will work with the general population.
  
They are throwing the money away. End of story. 
  
As to my sources, I’m sure you know how the google machine works. Well you didn’t even read the fucking article I don’t know what I expect from you. Why are the lazy always such big proponents of UBI?

Teach me comrade

The cause of poverty isn’t poverty. That’s a gross oversimplification. Be as obtuse as you’d like, I’m still not wrong.

My solution would be one that hasn’t already been proven objectively ineffective. 
  
Poor people aren’t poor just because they don’t have any money. 
  
Having said that I’d gladly stop working for some free money.
