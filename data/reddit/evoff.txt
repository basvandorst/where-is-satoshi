Miner profitability isn't particularly dropping 
@_date: 2018-01-22 12:17:35
Miners aren't really for anything in that. There's a big set full of segwit-heavy transactions that went through in some blocks
@_date: 2018-01-21 18:03:07
It's just some very segwit heavy addresses, but the adoption didn't get any better (first chart)
@_date: 2018-01-15 15:24:37
You mean zero? How is that a problem?
@_date: 2018-01-25 17:48:53


Doesn't that mean mining was still a bad idea, and you should have bought them instead of mining them?
@_date: 2018-01-14 22:35:15
Just any crypto community at this point
@_date: 2018-01-16 11:51:58
How do you challenge a government if it criminalizes bitcoin? You don't 
@_date: 2018-01-21 12:36:54
@_date: 2018-01-14 14:12:05
Because transactions are evicted from the mempool by some nodes to artificially cap it at 300MB by default.
@_date: 2018-01-15 19:55:07
Won't happen before a while

Right now it would cost 1BTC for every 20MB, so roughly 1,000$/MB
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:26:20
It's rather 1.1MB right now (
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:28:01
It's speculation. No guarantee of anything, you can lose a ton of money, or win a ton.

Source for 99.9% of the world wealth?
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:38:59
Yeah this is low
@_date: 2018-09-07 13:44:36
When bitcoin was hard forked, it didn't make the coins invalid, so no
@_date: 2018-09-28 17:05:53
Saying "daily reminder" doesn't make your politically charged opinion a fact. Many countries that had a good dose of socialism in western Europe are doing much better than the US
@_date: 2018-08-24 08:12:08
Oh the irony. You clearly don't know the chinese either
@_date: 2018-08-12 16:38:12
Right now miners get most of their money from the 4%inflation, not from fees
You are just throwing fees at banks PLUS bitpay or whatever they use
@_date: 2018-08-24 10:20:42
It didn't. It's a predictable event, and leads to a smaller instream of bitcoins, which is already very small compared to the quantities being traded. This is just hype
@_date: 2018-08-27 13:05:57
The market stopped being rational a long while ago anyway
@_date: 2018-08-24 12:12:48
Yeah, hence it didn't, because it's priced in since forever. It is a guaranteed event. No surprise going to happen, market won't change
@_date: 2018-08-08 14:28:09
Yeah but the available supplies would be more than enough for just electronics. Then the cost would just be the extraction costs more or less
@_date: 2018-08-30 07:24:11
Important good news should drive the price up, and reversely. Right now the price is heavily manipulated and decorrelated from the real usage.
When Steam dropped bitcoin, the price didn't go down, in fact it *went up*
@_date: 2018-05-03 14:56:10
Just look at the market cap?
@_date: 2019-03-21 16:24:38
Yeah yeah people with different opinions "misunderstand" the blockchain or they're trolls.
Yadi yada
Or maybe it's because they actually understand it better than you that they don't believe in this collective delusion
@_date: 2019-03-21 12:37:46
Out of arguments huh
@_date: 2019-03-21 12:44:32
It's not possible to build such a decentralized robust monetary system. Bitcoin fails in doing that in many ways, and alternatives fail too
You cannot increase the block size too much, LN doesn't scale either, you are left processing some 10tx/s
@_date: 2019-03-21 17:30:57
I have time, feel free to come back later
@_date: 2019-03-20 09:37:18
Also, that translates to Dicktown

He was fired, kicked out of the team: 
He was kinda the last moderate guy on the team about the "no 2x" stuff.

Moikka. Please be careful with B12, it takes years before problems will appear.
@_date: 2017-08-17 01:58:34
Why do Bitcoin fans feel the need to shit on altcoins, some of which definitely bring improvements to the implementation of the original for a bunch of use cases?
@_date: 2017-08-18 20:14:23
Up almost  $2000 if you count both :)
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:14:33
BTC has been like this for years now. Bad scaling and refusal to make changes 
@_date: 2017-08-18 18:09:42
He was fired for political reasons 
@_date: 2017-08-13 13:51:52
It's because they're compared to BTC lol They're not all red compared to USD or anything else.
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:38:50
Why is a long delay a sign of ASICBoost?
@_date: 2017-08-21 00:33:50
Of course, I agree. But Jeff was kicked, he didn't leave. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 10:55:04
It's turned on here too afaik, just like in every sub I know of. I get throttled in every sub I have unpopular opinions 
@_date: 2017-08-25 13:50:48
How would attacking BCH sabotage Antpool's sabotage?
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:12:34
I think the transaction volume isn't unusual though.
@_date: 2017-08-22 02:25:05
What? It's a verifiable fact.
@_date: 2017-08-25 21:01:06
40-70% on average, I heard
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:34:37
The reason why the mempool is constantly increasing is rather because of the low hashrate. You can't spam the mempool for months without losing a fortune in fees.
@_date: 2017-08-20 23:23:38


@_date: 2017-08-25 20:56:02
That's a good point, however the developers clearly have control of good parts of bitcoin. The main client (will be disconnecting nodes signaling Segwit2x), and several discussion platforms. A lot of people are simply putting their trust in them because not everyone (me included) really understands all those mechanics enough to make such a complex decision. Hence it is helpful to debate about the people.
@_date: 2017-08-12 09:23:24
Because it was extremely uncertain? Many things could have happened and bankrupted you. You were right not to put all your money in 2011.
If you roll a dice and can bet either on odd or 6, you bet on odd and get 6, you shouldn't regret your decision. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 23:29:48
All right!
@_date: 2017-08-14 21:12:59
Very well worded
@_date: 2019-08-02 22:33:19
@_date: 2018-06-14 09:37:12
There's a ton of fake volume around, lots of meaningless charts
@_date: 2018-06-29 12:26:28
How is storing value a good use for the most volatile asset ever?
@_date: 2018-06-12 14:40:53
But Bitcoin is planned to have a yearly 4% inflation rate in 2018...
@_date: 2018-06-25 08:57:20
Lay down and pull the legs, it's not hard at all
@_date: 2019-08-02 14:38:06
I can't decide if it is parody or just peak recklessness
@_date: 2019-08-11 12:23:23
Also, big ass sanctions
@_date: 2019-02-13 11:54:58
In my experience the government (almost) never seizes any fiat either. They just coerce you to pay fines, taxes, etc. And crypto is no different in that regard. You're not much of a winner if you get to keep your crypto in jail
@_date: 2019-08-11 16:19:47
Because gold takes its value from scarcity
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:58:07
I'm not in Bitcoin to earn money and never will. I am not looking to get richer. I want a highly adopted coin that can be used without relying on third parties.
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:01:53
Or the loss of crypto adoption in general, which has taken a setback of a few years in my opinion.
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:20:40
What did I lose? I didn't have any money in any of the two sides.
@_date: 2019-02-20 09:30:46
Because no one knows what is a low or a high. If you bought the 6000$ low you got fcked
@_date: 2017-11-09 08:33:21
I'm not a gambler, I don't get hooked by FOMO tactics. The expectation is negative.
@_date: 2019-02-07 15:05:29
So what happens when we reach the max block size again ?
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:48:06
I had plans to invest in Bitcoin after the fork. Now that won't happen. Sorry, Bitcoin will not get my money.
@_date: 2019-02-11 15:19:02
More valuable, but less used
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:19:14
This is naive.
@_date: 2017-11-09 08:30:30
Bitcoin is not a stock, it's a p2p cash system 
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:00:08
Bitcoin is very clearly defined, it is the majority chain, the chain with the most proof of work. This chain is, at this moment, marked by tickers XBT/BTC on exchanges.
@_date: 2019-02-07 18:48:25
I don't see LN UX being ready anytime soon...
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:17:06
Yes, but this growth will slow down as the mempool becomes congested
@_date: 2019-02-11 14:18:19


So bitcoin's growth can be killed by regulation? Doesn't that defeat the point?
@_date: 2019-04-16 11:15:38
Huh? It was a soft fork
@_date: 2019-04-15 10:37:03
Why wouldn't people use a clone (or a somehow better chain ) where 80% of the wealth hasn't already been distributed to a small amount of people?
@_date: 2018-03-23 11:46:34
No it does not matter how many tx there are
@_date: 2019-01-08 21:42:26
No, but lite clients are, well, lighter. That is the benefit.
@_date: 2018-11-23 12:07:40
But you can't get more than what you put in the LN?
@_date: 2019-01-22 13:03:27


  




be careful, you'll have to justify this income to your tax system
@_date: 2019-01-08 17:16:05
It would definitely kill the trust in bitcoin 
And all exchanges are centralized 
@_date: 2019-01-24 17:23:15
Exactly. And that's why no one uses bitcoin but criminals and gambling addicts
@_date: 2019-01-24 09:59:46
Why should they give you a discount? They have taxes to pay too
@_date: 2019-01-08 17:12:21
Because it is heavy, I assume
@_date: 2018-03-23 11:45:36
No one said that
@_date: 2018-03-27 00:03:32




What privacy does that violate? Everything is publicly on the blockchain anyway
@_date: 2019-01-08 22:27:45


@_date: 2018-02-27 23:53:34
You're not wrong
@_date: 2019-01-08 20:20:50
They don't secure the blockchain, but they provide benefits to the user
@_date: 2019-01-14 08:53:19
And its production is not...
@_date: 2019-01-08 17:11:18
Huh, it's a lot of old conspiracy theorists, not the bitcoin crowd at all
@_date: 2019-01-08 22:10:28
The who point of a lite something is that it does most of the things the full version does, and is lighter. 
@_date: 2019-01-08 17:08:55
The conspiracy sub has been very far right recently yeah. I also read a lot of laughable cliches on europe that show it's clearly a lot of americans 
@_date: 2018-03-23 15:02:17
No one ever regrets buying in a bull market... until it's not one anymore
@_date: 2017-09-24 23:11:15

@_date: 2017-09-28 10:06:02

@_date: 2017-09-24 23:06:11
Almost all bitcoin subs are echo chambers, sadly
@_date: 2018-03-09 10:54:26

@_date: 2017-09-02 08:53:11
Not really, very different things happen every month 
@_date: 2017-10-13 10:49:40
Miners don't mean that much, it just means the mempool will less fast
@_date: 2018-02-12 15:26:10
@_date: 2017-10-02 07:24:44
It would be inaccurate to say China does not matter; the loss has simply been compensated by Bitcoin growth.
@_date: 2018-07-31 09:16:02
If gold stopped being a precious metal seen as luxury its value would plummet by like 98%
@_date: 2018-07-17 08:23:06
Even if no one was panic selling or foolishly trading, 50% (or more) would be losing their money.

There is no way your computers would be more efficient at heating than a 30 years old electric heating system
@_date: 2018-07-31 08:48:32
Gold intrinsic value is tiny compared to its current value
@_date: 2018-07-20 11:32:58
You can't save money by mining (other than the profit in crypto that you mine)
If you saved up to 30 bucks a month you either heated less than usual or the crypto you sold was worth much more than 30 bucks a month
Heating with computers isn't exactly efficient

And the people who only bpught in the first 9 years are actually the minority.  Otherwise they wouldn't be making money
How is being transferrable over the internet going to change anything?
@_date: 2018-07-20 16:06:09
The spread of the heat would be very poor I believe
@_date: 2018-07-13 15:28:38
At this point it's just gambling
@_date: 2018-07-16 18:51:17
The amount of money made in crypto = the amount of money lost in crypto (actually &lt; considering mining)
Since everyone who bought in the first 9 years made profit, they are the minority.
@_date: 2017-10-13 17:37:55
Well that could affect how the fork goes if one chain gets massive fees from hashpower starvation, idk
@_date: 2018-07-14 08:12:57
And  they were right
Something something past performance something future performance
@_date: 2018-04-24 17:35:53
If you mine 24\*6\*8MB blocks every day, you need more bandwidth to run a node than if you mine 24\*6\*1MB blocks every day, so it increases the minimum bandwidth to be able to run a node. Nodes help with decentralization stuff
@_date: 2018-04-24 17:41:03
Can't you just exchange it afterwards anyway?

I once saw a comment about a Syrian child, who was heading to Canada, lying dead on a Turkish beach, used to try and create fear mongering about migrants, as if it is of any notable magnitude in European history
@_date: 2018-04-25 00:20:21
The maximum amount of on chain transactions is bound to the block size.
You got everything right, don't be so humble
@_date: 2018-04-26 16:16:02
The instream of bitcoins is already negligible. It's not going to get any significantly scarcer
@_date: 2018-07-28 12:18:02
People who would invest like this are the ones who  don't give a fuck aboit using bitcoin,  only speculation
@_date: 2019-05-17 18:22:31
That is very farfetched
