The way bitcoin refund is you have to sort it out with the merchant yourself. It's possible to add an escrow layer which microsoft and you have to agree upon. (in the current system it's visa/mastercard)
In this case, you just have to find the sale manager of microsoft, drag him to a corner of building, keep punching him in the face until he give your bitcoin back.

I bet him never travel much outside cities. Close your eyes and randomly point finger on world map, for 50 times, unlikely that it can land on a place where internet is good enough for full node.
The word city comes from simplicity which is a lie. If people aren't forced by economic, social pressure (and hopefully not internet speed), not many would want to live in it.
Decentralization among people who are centralized in a few areas is inferior.
@_date: 2016-08-23 01:34:56
Last we heard is they are still no clue how they got hacked, so likely inside job.

it's not meant for a cup of coffee. Buy coffee with bitcoin, then rebuy bitcoin from exchange, are you kidding ?
Fiat is forced by government so it works. When Paypal started out it has the benefit of online payment, nobody used it for coffee.
Credit card works because of convenience and debt.
What're the current benefits of bitcoin ? Gambling, medicine, porn, online shopping across country. The only way I see people start using it for coffee is when it's as convenient as CC with some discount to counter the benefit of CC reward. Lightning needs to happen, and somebody has to invent something on top of it to make it easy to use.

1. The existing P2P network already requires a network topology and the relaying of messages, with nodes typically having eight connections.  The Lightning Network topology is simply an extension of that.
2. Routing is not a significant problem, since even in massive networks the average number of steps in a path between users is small.
3. Even if there is a problem with routing, a payment could simply be made on-chain without the user even noticing the difference.
4. A small number of large channel operators can prevent routing problems.

Now the advent of the Information Age implies another revolution in the character of money. As cybercommerce begins, it will lead inevitably to cybermoney. This new form of money will reset the odds, reducing the capacity of the world's nation states to determine who becomes a Sovereign Individual. A crucial part of this change will come about because of the effect of information technology in liberating the holders of wealth from expropriation through inflation. Soon, you will pay for almost any transaction over the Net or World Wide Web at the same time you place it, using cybercash. This new digital form of money is destined to play a pivotal role in cybercommerce. It will consist of encrypted sequences of multihundred-digit prime numbers. Unique, anonymous, and verifiable, this money will accommodate the largest transactions. It will also be divisible into the tiniest fraction of value. It will be tradable at a keystroke in a multitrillion-dollar wholesale market without borders.

The benefits of airgap core full node vs hw wallet? On top of my head are, 1. Airdrop fork coin, youll be the first to claim with core, 2. lower profile (ppl with trazor probably rich early adopters, I rob them first) 3. Hw wallet isn't bullet proof, for example there was a bug in trezor lately that you have to update firmware or hacker can get to your private keys etc.... For The Linux Core airgap you could enhance security on your own such as triple encrypting it with different algorithms, storing in encrypted folder in truecrypted partition etc. One way that it can be fucked is your favourite linux distro/software got hosted with something that generates discoverable / mal private keys. So Ideally, you should use multisig addresses with different distro, running with separated machines like one intel, another one amd, another raspberry pi

dollar inflates, coins lost overtime (I read somewhere that now probably 4M are lost forever already, and it will keep going).

spread is pretty huge. Why bother ? when you can sell in GDAX with a better rate and pay almost everything with CC while enjoying reward, not to mention the delay to pay off CC when price hit your target.

The thing is semi anonymous is probably more desirable in most cases. Schnorr, CT, coinjoin, lightning will add some level of privacy. Pretty sure total anonymity is possible on sidechain when two-way pegged is available. So to me this sounds better flexibility of privacy

Well ppl who did just that in the oast 9 years are winners so far.   The day bitcoin go mainstream and those who havn't bought any could possibly put them on the street. Don't invest more than afford to lose meme from garvin is arguably the most financial ruin advice in crypto history.

It's just the mind. If we can stop pretending that we are going to live forever then there's no problem. 
For instance:

In the theory if nothing. Nothing does matter. Instead of getting stressed fighting for living, the alternative is to chill and rest in peace

Except at the end there will be like 5 bcash fullnodes in the biggest data centers of each continent just like Visa as bcash continue to allow spam into the chain by increasing blocksize subsiding tx fee advertising as the benefit of this altcoin. When reward runs out and fee remains neglectable, miners drop out, more forks, more forks to keep the misconceived coin going... Satoshi probably never wants this

Because blockchain isn't good as currency. Once lightning is on, and smartmen will make it so that it's as easy as or easier than CC, merchants will take it. Merchant is whore. They don't care.
Still just speculation on exchange, people can easily make a lot of transactions. Fund locking up isn't a problem either because LN is supposed to be for small stuff. Im okay to lock up 1btc and use it for a year for monthly cashing out to pay for CC. What I'm uncomfortable is to leave 1 btc on an exchange for a long time just to save tx fee is dumb...

This time it be different. Those days we took hit after hit, gox, willy bot, china, major exchanges hacked. And more importantly, ppl were less hundred times exposure of now. Even more importantly, those were days when not much happening to the protocol as malleability was the bottleneck. Now we are having high tech stuff lining up, full segwit support in core, mast Schnorr, simplicity rootstock LN are going to happen in a year more or less,. So it won't be 3 year winter as it happened at that time. Plus people are betting on multi trillion mcap, back in those days nobody ever dreamt of

This guy fucks. for new tech to replace old tech it has to be 10x better at something. bitcoin is 10x better than fiat at store of value. but 10x worse than cc at payment. (today). the mainstream in the developed world will not use bitcoin as currency until the volatility is tiny, so not for a few years. for volatility to decrease enough, bitcoin has to grow 5-50x. so we're still in the middle of the investment/speculative stage. We're only now finally making transition from nerds to professional investors. In venture finance terms, nerds = seed investment, then series A (pros), then series B, C, D...., then IPO (mainstream)

A friend told me about it, said it's  tripled since he bot, we laughed and laughed of how stupid it was. I opened dwolla account and made my first purchase just to keep track of the comedy that it provided. Then bitcoingem the first crypto ponzi, satoshi diced came out, crypto stocks in bitfunder and another site I forgot the name, but the owner name started with "burn" something from Oregon. I played with them, actually lost a few hundred coins, but it was wow experience then a bought more until I had no fiat left

20x from 1000? Well you could even pick 450 as it was avg of last winter. Anyway, judging from ta, I thought 8000 had to be the stop for a long rest, nope it broke out blew pass 12000 level like nothing. I gave up predicting. Let it rise and will see. To me current price should be between 8000-12000, so it is atmost 2.5x rise. 
@_date: 2018-09-27 09:15:53

Easy. First we eat less, stop worship meat, then we kill less and farm less. Can you imagine how much food can we save if most American split a hamburger into 7 pieces and eat one piece each day along with veggie and beans? Next, world hunger problem doesn't exist. When we throw more food to Africa, guess what ? It allows them to reproduce more and need more food. So instead of focusing on food, thow in education, condoms, jobs -- things for people to do. I have seen it. There's not much purpose in life besides thievery for most poor African. So they grow up, fuck, have 10 kids before 40, fortunately most die at 50. And the cycle continues.

Yes, segwit adoption is the only way. It only costs like a dollar to do segwit tx. On top of that, it will make spamming less effective which is the main reason the network clogged. Then LN is coming within a year. So stop using lazy ass services haven't upgraded.

Yes. 5years hodl sounds correct to make a millionaire. The only difference for old and new hodler is the initial investment. 5 years ago it only need a couple of grands to become a million today. New hodler is probably required to put in at least 70k to see millions in 5 years. We are betting for some trillions market cap. 8T is doable which is 25 times of the current marketcap. Beyond that is possible too, but it would be a different world than what we are living...

I have installed it. Played with it a bit. I see usd market is dominated by Zelle which can link to my banks. I'll make a real trade as soon as I have free time.

So if I have it right. Vyron does not represent the stake in bluefrontier company but the currency that bluefrontier require to do business with, sometimes in the future ? It's a little funny to think about. Like say Brunei found new chunk of oil, deep far from coast, they don't have money to dig them out yet, plus some uncertainties of the operation. Instead of selling future contract of the oil, they sell Byron token instead, saying it's the only mean to do business with them. How much Byron it cost for a ton of oil has yet to be specified. How could investors speculate the value of Vyron? Say in 2022, BF finish building one floating unit, and offer it for rent. They can pump the coin by just saying the cost of one month rental is 1 Vyron, which could easily imply 100k usd.

Of course after it hit 200$, we told a few multi millionaires in the circle, but they were too genius in their own mind and didn't like comedy film, so they laughed at us instead.

If we prefer big blocksize before LN, it could delay LN adoption because of less economic incentive. It may sound like Core has put pressure towards LN, but there's no better known solution. N tx is still N tx regardless of blocksize. As now bitcoin can be digital gold. To be also be currency, scaling in the way LN does has to happen. We can go to the moon with just being gold replacement alone, but with that plus having currency property can get us to Mars.

@_date: 2017-03-20 07:01:44
Not really. What satoshi missing is he didn't foresee after 9 years that spv and pool mining centralization would prevail. That lefts us with guy like jihad, ver, maybe chinese government could be behind influencing. I know extreme liberals buy in bitcoin coin as p2p money, do they buy in because of mining centralization as well? Core put the code that's from the technical point of view is safest, out there, and let miners vote. 95% is clearly no coercion. Anyway in order for bitcoin to gain more value, it has to be like carnival, elephants and tigers. Parents bring in kids (mainstream) for candy (buying coffee, whatnot, practically on LN) while they make profit selling booze to parents( drug, porn, gambling, p2p anonymous money). Admit it bitcoin will never go mainstream without 2nd layer. You want it to be p2p money that's fine, but it has to attract other audiences, not to mention sidechaining/smart contract. So what BU is doing now is actually stalling bitcoin value. Extremists might be okay with that buy not for most people for sure

Yeah like this FUD. Mining revenue is short term. Miner don't care as much of bitcoin future as much as investors. BU say they are the way to decentralized, but  everybody else seeing at as using mining centralization to force the direction of bitcoin. Now bitcoin is store of value which comes from the speculation of future usages - - LN, safe instant unconfirmed, sidechaining, smart contract etc, also decentralization. No investors cares of mining industry in china. pool centralization, decline of number of full nodes make it look worse. What BU has to offer? Some buggy code 5000 more lines than segwit, half assed audit by a guy or two. No Schnorr sig, no mast, no cool technologies added. Let's face it, BU dev cannot maintain more sophisticated code than the core code base.

How / when? 


Sure after segwit is active. according to LN guys calculation, 1mb with segwit is barely enough, it has to be increased, but pry not removing the limit entirely unless there are answers for the downside of it such as ddos, full node decentralization, block reward fee compensation 
@_date: 2017-03-15 23:26:09

@_date: 2017-03-13 14:33:44
Say BU fork off before Segwit activation, those miners will be making invalid blocks, thereby the only legit hashrate left will mostly be segwit. So that's how we get 95%, am I right ?

You lock in 1000 and use that for 1 month with the benefit of instant unconfirmed , what's wrong with it? If you not okay to lock in such amount, it's okay, use your damn nickle and penny, is less hassle tiomerchant, no wait for 10-60 mins

They finally realized the more they fuck around with BU, the less price becomes. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 13:34:25
Core pry make a hard fork increase after segwit is activated. Hard fork requires months to year of planning. I remember hearing the LN guys (poon and t...) mentioned that even with segwit, the 1mb block limit is barely enough for LN adoption according to their calculation. So since Blockstream push LN, they have to push HF at some point. But should segwit fail to activate, community split, shit hit fan, none of these might not happen, then another 2013 bear is guaranteed. Why don't we all stick with core plan and enjoy bitcoin rally instead of fucking around with Rodger nutjob? 
@_date: 2017-03-22 20:19:21
I don't have problem with him believing in big block, but being bitcoin icon making his voice very loud. When combine with his enormous wealth, he managed to convince big pool operators.

who? If any alts can replace bitcoin, it will break trust on both. Investors can no longer know when it will be replaced by other alts. So I don't think it will happen. The only exception is it has to blow anything bitcoin offers away. Eth? Meh, it hasn't solved anything beyond being a hard fork experiment.

Eveb there's no limit to block size. N tx is still N tx. Bitcoin will nit be as good currency as fiat or ven visa. Segwit is the paved way to LN which solve the problem. BU is short term solution with risky HF, with 10k lines if code changed, skim audited by one or two unfit devs, with miners/sockpuppets/small community in bitcoin.com/rbtc/btc.com all funded by a guy Rodger who invested a lot in eth, dash, xmr, good for him for a brief.

In the current form, butt could be gold replacement backed by fear, which is already  good enough to wake up mr moon numerous times, but currency, no, far away from it. It needs to handle capacity. Offchain solution like LN has to happen. ETF, market cap has to be like 50b+. Then volatility should be less chaos. Then merchants / IOT could try to adopt it. Openbuttzaar or whatever is too soon. Now we have, butt &gt; $ &gt; goods. It's gift card. Butt has been trying to be many things, store of value, currency, darknet currency, privacy, distributed immutable database, smart contract, trustless IOT DAO stuff. It's like what the ob guy said earlier, circus, elephants and lions. As for altbutt, it's even more silly, if an altbutt can surpass butt, how could investors be sure that it won't be defeated by another altbutt, so it's unlikely to happen.

Now bitcoin is store of value which comes from the speculation of future usages - -  LN, safe instant unconfirmed, sidechaining, smart contract etc, also decentralization. No investors cares of mining industry in china. pool centralization, decline of number of full nodes make it look worse. What BU has to offer? Some buggy code 5000 more lines than segwit, half assed audit by a guy or two. No Schnorr sig, no mast, no cool technologies added.

I know without Ver trying to put pressure on increasing block size, somebody else will. With a good amount of pressure it's good, sigh.., at some point enough is enough. I'm pretty sure Core and BS are very clear that there is actually demand for blocksize increase and it should be on their roadmap. Now it's getting to the point of destruction - - we need new dev team to replace the compromised one, we want flextran instead of segwit because segwit was invented by one of the core Core, bitcoin unlimited President, replace BIP with BUIP, BU bugs, attack, closed source, w/e sigh.

With inflation/human expansion to other planets in the next few centuries, plus other unimaginable shits I'm sure, if Bitcoin still to be relevant, one coin has to worth several millions USD, however it's unlikely that USD will last that long..

Does it really matter ? It's possible to turn 1BTC into 1.1 or 1.2. But when BTC is worth several millions, does that .1/.2 justify the risk of missing out the train entirely ?

Exactly my thought, although this hasn't accounted for the event that Bitcoin turn mainstream and everything flippening. If we are to stay in the speculation mode this is what it likely to come out. Anyway, multiple mayer has it that if you buy under 2.4, you are unlike dumb.

The reason for this last rally has more something to do with the coin auction. Price rallies up before a big auction, then sell off after, it happens like this every time (3 times) in bitcoin history.

no, we are likely going to fight global warming, sea level rising, hurricane, volcano and natural disasters like never before in the next 70 years not even enough time to start world war iii. I suggest everybody learn to swim in the open ocean, sailing, whitewater kayaking and diving. Global debt crisis will start to make countries popped one by one just like the heat pops volcanos. Once that happens people will soon to lose faith in the concept of fiat and state. Anyway Egyptian and Roman ruled the world for about 1 thousand years, Greek 500 years, England 150 years, now US just turned 120 years dominance. It's very unlikely they can remain superpower for long as the ancient time, in fact, it's been predicted China will replace them by 2030. However, we now have internet, countries / technologies and even the people are well connected. The strong used to take every single thing of the weaker ones like today we farm the cows to drink their milk and kill their entire family for meat afterwards, not anymore, they can only use debt to slave the poor. Power tends to shift downwards as the pleb get smarter and organized. At some point they would stop to rely on government backed banks but to be their own bank themselves.

or 
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:08:00
The lightning network. To be good money, a currency has to be able to handle high transactions. Fiat and cc -- centralized services have the benefit to handle a lot of transaction. But as we know, fiat is government manipulation, centralized service has undesired properties. That's where decentralized crypto money comes in, but it never practical to store coffee and cupcake tx to everybody nodes. LN is semi-decentralized in a sense. So middle ground. However, the key feature is the unconfirmed tx is now trustable in LN, so it can be practical to everyday purchase, itoa and whatnot.

It's because I'm a bad trader and I KNOW I'M A BAD TRADER.  Yeah you good traders can spot the highs and the lows pit pat piffy wing wong wang just like that and make a millino bucks sure no problem bro.  Likewise the weak hands are like OH NO IT'S GOING DOWN I'M GONNA SELL he he he and then they're like OH GOD MY ASSHOLE when the SMART traders who KNOW WHAT THE FUCK THEY'RE DOING buy back in but you know what?  I'm not part of that group.  When the traders buy back in I'm already part of the market capital so GUESS WHO YOU'RE CHEATING day traders NOT ME~!  Those taunt threads saying "OHH YOU SHOULD HAVE SOLD" YEAH NO SHIT.  NO SHIT I SHOULD HAVE SOLD.  I SHOULD HAVE SOLD MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY SELL AND BOUGHT MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY BUY BUT YOU KNOW WHAT NOT EVERYBODY IS AS COOL AS YOU.  You only sell in a bear market if you are a good day trader or an illusioned noob.  The people inbetween hold.  In a zero-sum game such as this, traders can only take your money if you sell.

Bitcoin rode on low fee ads in the beginning. It's like those credit card benefits that were changed by the banks after they got enough customers, you know.

don't forget to consider network propagation / verification. It takes days to sync bitcoin blockchain from the start already. How fast verification is depends on RAM / cpu and the size of block. With full one 1 mb block, my macbook is already crawling. As the years go by, people will shift to smart phone, tablet devices. Only the expert gets to have a laptop at home. I used to be a computer geek, now I barely touch my laptop and I won't buy a new one if it breaks. So to be able to run full node on smartphone is a desirable property of decentralization, considering an average person probably has a couple old smart phones sitting on the shelf, might as well connect them to SSDs turning into full nodes as long as verification isn't too bitch. 
Imagine, in the world where cash disappears, without blockchain people use solutions like CC. CC could stand work because they wipeout old transactions, but with blockchain, a guy buy candy and it stays there forever. LN / offchain solution is the only way to make blockchain able to replace cash. I haven't mentioned ITOA transactions which could make cash transaction looks tiny in comparison when it takes off. There's a reason why investors in Silicon Valley invest so much in bitcoin, as they believe ITOA is unavoidable, and there must be a payment system that can handle it.

2. Undiscovered technical flaws

Bitcoin is now digital gold. Gold is a wealth preservation, the more people holding gold, the more confidence of it. Wether or not can it be currency depends on LN adoption imo. Fiat/CC are already easy, the current form of crypto money can never be easier regardless of block size/block time.

Argument against bigger block: n(no of tx) is still n, no matter how big block is. LN is the only solution we have as now. The key to the moon

Before segwit, bitcoin supports 2.7 tx/sec which means mom,dad,son cannot buy coffee at the same second. Now we have like 6 tx/sec, while Visa supports 2000 tx/sec because it only stores those tx in a few computers. Decentralized currency replicates data to every computer. Space in blockchain will be like land in NY used for settling only important transactions while not so important ones goes on second layer such as LN. Sure, we can unlimit the blocksize and store unlimited number of tx, but even not to mention network capacity for replication, how many computers can we keep such data? Maybe only on super large servers on 10 data centers around the world. Roger Ver would say, this is fine, but why do we need to invent blockchain and do all this when we already have Visa/Mastercard network doing the similar thing. Meth supports like 20 tx/sec. While nobody is using it to solve any real world problems. It's already growing pass 200G in 3 years, heading to run on data center only mode. The point of decentralized money is, first it has to be decentralized. Not to go pass the Moore law of personal devices.

@_date: 2016-06-24 09:14:47
not much different. But price should gradually rise after shortage of coin is in effect. Although it won't go more than a few thousands until we can support more transaction.
@_date: 2017-08-28 15:27:00
From investment perspective, if an alt can surpass the number 1 coin, how can investors be sure that it won't be surpassed other alts. So this won't likely to happen unless it blows the number 1 away. Big investors won't weekly check bitcointalk for new alt announcements for potential threat. They buy the bitcoin and sit on it.

already higher 16,525,263 BCH	vs  16,523,075 BTC . And I think it's not working as intended. A lot of block is produced when there's a few tx. Then when miners jump, it can take a few hours for a block causing starvation

In lightning scenario you pay the guy bit by bit until he's done his job, he can only screw you at your last payment which if it's broken down into small enough chunks he would have no incentive to do so. In multisig scenario, we would have a decentralized arbitration system, could be human, could be smart contracts if the job is simple enough, rather than having to rely solely on company like visa/mastercard and FBI. Anyway fuck altcoin eterium, that thing is heading towards centralization since day 1.

You are lucky to get that 100 back. Years ago I withdrew a stack of 20s from citibank atm just to deposit them to Chase (old fashion remittance). They scanned them, and the machine caught one of the 20s counterfeit. I explained them I just effing got them from a nearby citibank atm how's that possible ? They confiscated that 20 bill, wrote down my info for fbi, and sorry for your loss. From that day, I no longer trust USD.

Its better for people to discovet bitcoin by themselves than trying to lump into their heads. I recommended bitcoin to a few millionaires around me since 2013. They haven't got one yet. I guess partly because jealousy, pride, and thought they had missed the ship. If they had found btc themselves, they would make believe them were genius and bot shiton already. So my effort was negative to these people

eth is useful as example of what not to do, xmr is anonymous until you put that shipping address in also once bitcoin has CT, its pretty much irrelevant, ltc, doge, bcash are the same category. In theory anything can be added to bitcoin, if such feature is really need it smart men will make it work with btc. So far the problems those alts trying to solve dont exist. So in the long run all alts flow back to btc

2x and bcash try to become btc. But as we know, only btc is btc. They expect 2x to fail due to nobody really onboards, so the only place where big blockers can run into is bcash. They even arrange bcash miners (well, ant and their friends) to fork a fix for eda calling dda or something right before 2x split attempt.  Thats about it big blockers can go jerk off trying to get their coin accept by merchants and whatnot. Since there wont be any significant improvement to bcash protocol as they ripped out segwit, so they cant merge cool stuff like mast schnorr simplicity ln to the coin. So expect selloffs after the final pump. So dont touch bcash, only convert it to btc, the shit wont last long

well we probably wont need to wait for 15 years to know if its going to die or triumph. The longest btc winter is 3 years, when it sounded a lot more ponzi than it is now. So in the worst case, a middle class family should only endure the interest for 2 years (1 free apr), so around 14,000$ if they get the cards so enough to buy 5btc at 7000. it wont just stay lower than 7000 for 14 years and in year 15th started to jump to millions. anywho, look at the upside, the sky is the limit

hes right actually saying eventually the fee has to rise to compensate mining fee and he proposed the simple payment channel, but he hadnt got to lightning part yet as payment channel has its weakness. Eventually txs settling on blockchain will be similar to bank to bank transfer, small tx will be on 2nd layer. Big blockers think otherwise though, they hope for moore law to fix all the shit ,but in reality blockchain growth outpaces moore law to centralization. For the convenience of user, once we have LM adopted, it should be even more easier than credit card

its been said many times. In short, if bitcoin can be changed by a group of ppl in a backdoor deal, it will lose its philosophy. Core devs are all about consensus. 2x is everything they against for. In the worst case, 2x won, miners attack original chain, core devs change pow, might as well reduce blocksize, keep working on those high tech. And no serious devs work on new chain. It then eventually loses value. Investors move money to the original. So split wallet, if fork succeed. Wait and see

@_date: 2017-11-23 00:26:24
Forget mass adoption. for new tech to replace old tech it has to be 10x better at something. bitcoin is 10x better than fiat at store of value. but 10x worse than cc at payment. (today). the mainstream in the developed world will not use bitcoin as currency until the volatility is tiny, so not for a few years. for volatility to decrease enough, bitcoin has to grow 10-100x. so we're still in the middle of the investment/speculative stage. We're only now finally making transition from nerds to professional investors. In venture finance terms, nerds = seed investment, then series A (pros), then series B, C, D...., then IPO (mainstream)
@_date: 2017-11-19 02:04:08
First rule, never sell bitcoin for altcoins, especially the one built by airdropping. The opportunity to make money safely on bcash pump was like from 0.12 to maybe 0.22 which isn't a lot really, there are other obscure alts that's safer to gamble from times to times

Shouldn't some of those stock/derivative value somehow flow into btc too? Because digitally, bitcoin can be more than store of value and payment, rootstock, simplicity, privacy, storage, the entire internet, you name it, can relate to bitcoin, " in theory" . And people will understand that to date about 4 millions of btc are lost forever, and the number is growing everyday so we can't just multiply 21M with price for marketcap

well if pools are smart enough to detect spamming pattern(shouldn't be that hard ?), filter them out and include legit low transaction fee, that be great.
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:30:33
Can't share that but if the way tx is processed is by taking the big fee first, those 5-10,10-20 bands would never get thinner, but what we are seeing in the graph is just the higher bands have more chance tho get processed. I think the bitcoinfee.21 is still somewhat accurate because I used to send like 6 sat when congestion all the time and it usually confirms within timeframe they predicted. I used 1 sat before at congestion, took like 5 days rather than getting dropped out of the pool

Those that did have been right so far, although I would strongly advice against it because it will create bubble and pop.

The key of success is to do the exact opposite of the majority

Forget public. Dont waste time telling ppl around you at this time. for new tech to replace old tech it has to be 10x better at something. bitcoin is 10x better than fiat at store of value. but 10x worse than cc at payment. (today). the mainstream in the developed world will not use bitcoin as currency until the volatility is tiny, so not for a few years. for volatility to decrease enough, bitcoin has to grow 10-100x. so we're still in the middle of the investment/speculative stage. We're only now finally making transition from nerds to professional investors. In venture finance terms, nerds = seed investment, then series A (pros), then series B, C, D...., then IPO (mainstream)

It doesn't look practical in reality, does it? Say we have c++ code, what is the tool to verify it? Point number 2. So even we have multiple clients bugfree by oracle verifier, producing same output, why do we need to have many when we can just have one.

It is because it's the paved way to LN. Does Lite need LN?
 absolutely not, block is still empty as shit. Is Malleability fix needed? Who cares. Of course pumpers want it but that's about it. Edit: Oh well, besides pumping, maybe Lite is served as a political tool to put pressure on Jihad.

The approach works on typical software but not when we require consensus. If Bitcoin can be developed by many codebases, they would have done it since 2010. Unless you say fork is okay but it's not okay almost everyone when it comes to money.

For some reasons, I suspected the disappearance of President friedcat might have something to do with Jihan or Bitmain. Bitmain then became number one in China after that.

different hardwares/environments alone can break consensus, unless you say the mighty oracle verifier can also verify bitcoin clients on top of them. I'm also skeptical of different languages, i guess what you mean is bitcoin consensus also has to be implemented in strong typed languages like those coq, haskell, ocaml,  w/e. That leaves out mainstream ones c++, java, python w/e.

That was when Lite was the number 1 alt. Good luck if you think it will come close to that number. There are other clone coins doge, ppc and whatnot, what makes Lite special. Yeah I guess Lite folks will try to find a way to activate SW by hash or by UASF, price should hold till then, then it will mark the point where everyone dump it, because the hype is done. LTC has no other uses until the next hype (LN?)

Or should I come out of nowhere make a pull request and see if it get included? How about I do the same to BU dev. I have some idea to include SW in BU because I believe it is the way to go, and I also believe that Flextran xthin are shit I like to emove them. I know if I go to talk with peter r or the zerg, they would say fuck off, so instead I make code changes, submit pull request. Of course it will be ignored.

Consensus by definition is everyone saying the same. If there are multiple compatible implementations, there's no point of implementing the same thing to produce the same output from the same input, if one implementation has a bug, it means chain split, they should just use the same library, (of course except for efficiency, different languages/platform whatnot but not what we concern)

What is the need to mention those here? If BU devs think AD/EB is sound, they should discuss it with Core dev on mailing list or w/e. BU shouldn't be mentioned here seeking community support when they can't win argument on technical side with Core devs. It's like when Gavin lost debate to the devs, he went on writing blogs seeking for support from  those who were not so well-informed, splitting community. This is political act. If BTC can be changed by politicians, why the hell did we do it in the first place when governments and banks already exist

I'm Roger Ver, long-time Bitcoin advocate and investor. Today, I'm at the Bitmain world headquarters in Shenzhen. I had a nice chat with Bitmain CEO, Jihan Wu, about the current shit storm. After him finished giving me head, he showed me multiple limited edition of S9 machines equipped with ASICBOOST. I'm sure these rigs are served only as a technology showcase, never sold, or used on the mainnet as it would be too unfair for competitors. They even went a step further by filing a Chinese patent to prevent anyone to exploit this hole in Bitcoin protocol. This accusation was caused by the guy who removed Gavin commit access, so none of his words should be taken seriously. By the way we are setting an international mega crypto exchange, so we can pump shitcoins that we invested, open up market for btu when HF happens, and maybe install some covert front running operations.

Nah. Blockchain isn't for coffee,  cup cake or online shopping. By directly using crypto coins, OB is technology confusion and being another spammer. It gives user a delusion that it's okay to use coin as every day stuff. I think the best route is to disable any coins including bitcoin and only support 2 layer like LN. You know since the beginning we made the marketing ploy for btc, alpaca sock, overstock, new egg, bitpay, and whatnot, yet for 9 years, crypto is still 10 times worse than cc, cash and paypal for payment. Now that we have LN, i think it's time to stop pretending and working towards the solution that has more chance to succeed

Ever since ebay stopped making paypal mandatory I switched to direct cc right away. There's no benefit going thru another layer of middleman.
I guess how  it works is paypal like to beat the shit out of smaller guys and bow to bigger ones.

I tried BLW. It says I have to pay to rent a cloud space to store channel something, something, turning me off more than eclair actually. Another thing turning me off is I have to pay to create initial channel. As far as I concern. I have some satoshis in lntip, but I can't get them out without paying on chain first, so, I'll wait for something more mature to enable me using LN for totally free. Yes, I'm an ass hole but I guess there are 1000 like me, that just want to install android and LN, but uninstall if after learning that they have to pay.....

In 10 years history of Bitcoin, I can't think of any stores accepting Btc or blockchain coins that does well beyond the initial hype because  although btc is 10x better than gold, it's 10x worse than cc/cash. LN on the other hand should give user way better experience, and they will come back. In Btc paying, most people who use Btc to pay for things enough have experience like "what a hassle, I'm not going to do that again." . For myself, I'm done buying anything with btc except fiat, waiting to try LN

Dear Customer although we keep over 99.5% of users' BTC deposits in secure multisig wallets, the small remaining amount in coins in our hot wallet are theoretically vulnerable to attack. We believe that our hot wallet keys might have been compromised and ask that all of our customer cease depositing cryptocurrency to old deposits addresses. We are in the process of creating a new hot wallet and will advise within the next few hours. Although this incident is unfortunate, its scale is small and will be fully absorbed by the company.

blockchain is for bank transfer. Bitcoin is 10x better than gold as store of value but 10x worse than cash/cc as currency. Day2day spending never works. We have been trying since the beginning. Big online merchants attempted to adopt it from times to times and always end up with embarrassment, Expedia/Overstock/Cheapair ... In retails we are worse. Haven't you heard of nightmare stories of Bigcamera ?

The beauty of hodling just btc is you buy it, forget about it, get rich 4 years laters whereas you buy shit like meth or lite, you have to watch them like hawk. Other alts are waiting to take their place and in theory whatever meth, xmr or w/e can do, Bitcoin can and will do if such feature is actually worth it, smartmen will make it available to the block chain. So shutcoins get attacked by other shits, and all the shits are underattack by Bitcoin as the time goes on

Because it's not needed. Just like segwit, there's not enough reason (now) to move people to the new format, until fee pressure kicks in. Staying in legacy format has advantage of easy to claim shitcoins airdrop. If fund is in multisig, it's complicated or even impossible on some coins, situation is worse for segwit. So one way to increase adoption is to launch a shitcoin promise to airdrop only to bech32 multisig Schnorr mast w/e address.

Roger Vers once said he was a cyberpunk 
@_date: 2017-09-24 02:08:46


They already have a lot of faith in miners not to create 51% attack. A lot of good guys in bcash eco, Vers, Wu, McAfee.  This is what he says about the current situation


Today I'm at the Bitmain headquarters in Beijing.
I had a nice chat with Bitmain CEO, Jihan Vers, about their current situation.
He showed me a bunch of asicboost machines with the enable switch in off position.
I'm sure that all the current mining centralization is temporary not because of a lack of mining participants.
The difficulty adjustment algorithm that bcash has modified are not able to keep up with the demands of the growing mining economy.
Three people that make up the bcash team are hard at work shilling, trolling getting paid nicely by the CEO, that eventually will make the marketcap of bcash surpasses the main chain and become the mainchain itself. For now,  I hope that everyone continue using SPV wallets. It is safe as the servers are in five biggest data centers of the world. And we can scale more than Visa in the next few years.

Forget mainstream. for new tech to replace old tech it has to be 10x better at something. bitcoin is 10x better than fiat at store of value. but 10x worse than cc at payment. (today). the mainstream in the developed world will not use bitcoin as currency until the volatility is tiny, so not for a few years. for volatility to decrease enough, bitcoin has to grow 10-100x. so we're still in the middle of the investment/speculative stage.

Not really. As bitcoin price rise, sending xcp token fee rise too. Even xcp can function in LN, i still wonder why it's needed when we have sidechain like RSK or whatnot because xcp remains alt status. In reality xcp progress has stalled since the two founer stepped down. I doubt they still hold the bag

In 2012 I felt we were already on the edge of mainstream too, but reality is it's thousand miles away. Forget mainstream. for new tech to replace old tech it has to be 10x better at something. bitcoin is 10x better than fiat at store of value. but 10x worse than cc at payment. (today). the mainstream in the developed world will not use bitcoin as currency until the volatility is tiny, so not for a few years. for volatility to decrease enough, bitcoin has to grow 10-100x. so we're still in the middle of the investment/speculative stage. We're only now finally making transition from nerds to professional investors. In venture finance terms, nerds = seed investment, then series A (pros), then series B, C, D...., then IPO (mainstream)
@_date: 2017-10-21 15:58:57
Time to sell your shit alts
@_date: 2018-03-15 08:16:09
One of bitcoin fact is that it takes about 4 years for btc investment to be worth above the worst volatility dip. My recommendation is always, buy it, keep it safe, forget about, come back 4 years later

Counterparty has many limitations like it's not cheap to send tokens as mempool grow, if it can't work with LN I don't see much future. Rsk on the other hand, together with Lumino could unlock the potential. Although RSK team seem quiet and not really open it to the public. I expected to see tutorials and whatnot. It's as if they launched it but still in testing phase

I have been running geth for over a year, i don't see how it can succeed, unstable and resource-heavy as fuck. It can succeed if trustless doesn't matter. In 2018 there are like 50 smart contract coins, shit like qtum, eos, lisk, nem, stellar, wave and so and so. Ico and dapp are whore, they can move across platforms, however so far I haven't met a dapp that solve a real problem, unless we count ponzi ico. There's a good chance that smart contract will move back to btc in the long run once we get adoption in rsk, ivy, simplicity, 2way pegged or whatever as btc is the most trusted, distributed, no figurehead leaders, anti human corruption

Once you pawns fight for Jihan and crowd him king, his voice will be 10k times bigger than plebs. He can make a few phone calls to lord Barry, prince Rodger and sir Olivere together with Coinbase/Bitpay uncapping 21M hard forking the shit out of it. The community will say okay, another hard fork, business as usual no big deal. Look what happened to meth. butterin hard forked it once, some uproared, 2nd time he did it, they gave less shit, 3rd time, they said Meh, whatever, whatever butterin say, bring in POS, bring in MAST, hard fork the shit.

When I watch those hollywood movies robbing bank for 500k, trafficking drugs for 50M and ended up in jail eventually, or manipulating market for a profit of a few hundred millions then ended badly.

yes, dont use windows though. use linux. (Core is full node wallet , so it's going to take about 3 days to sync up (130G as of now), SSD helps a lot -- you can run it with prune option later which will take only a few Gigs but there are some down sides like if you switch wallets, everything has to be downloaded etc, so if space isn't a problem, I suggest don't prune)

for 256mb blocks, how many nodes do you think will exist ? Maybe 5 on the biggest data centers on each continent. Roger probably says, "this is fine". But why did we invent blockchain in the first place when we already have visa, paypal, and government already having a few big machines to store replicated database. Big block blockchain will end up the same. With LN we can scale way pass LN, supporting entire cashless society, supporting IOT tx which nothing in existence has answer for it.

UASF real purpose was to set fire on asses so they can seek the way to activate segwit before Nov deadline. 2x real purpose is to push pressure on Core devs so they get the real scaling solution done.

We are way ahead of Moore Law. Bandwidth wised, it does not have to be Congo, full node home users of any countries except the top few ones already have a hard time to keep up. Space wised, if you run a node, you will quickly find out that, it's a pain and soon you have to get a SSD. Now 250G SSD is affordable, but using it to store somebody else coffee transaction is such a wasteful to precious space. If btc blockchain growth is like that of Eth, we would blow pass 250G and home nodes would extinct. CPU wised, for 1MB full block, it's already taking a few seconds to verify on my 2013 macbook. I guess it would be like 30% faster on the latest macbook. For 256mb block, it might need 5nm architecture and like 64 cores and what year will it be affordable to home users ? Truth is by moore law blockchain solution isn't ready for Visa size tx and when it does (year 2027 ?), the block reward would be so small that miners need higher fee to get motivated, so no coffee tx anyway.
Yes, LN solution is like coinbase, bitpay or w/e but with improvement of decentralization in many areas.
If we start off with centralized blockchain, building decentralized solutions on top of it never make sense. If we keep blockchain decentralized, we can add LN, Sidechain, w/e and thing can still be somewhat make sense.

Core is the referenced client. B2X forks from core to be the referenced client of B2x. If you use spv wallet like electrum or w/e. You have to wait for the devs to make it possible to split (ie, they have to modify electrum servers to support b2x, might have to do some work on gui etc etc). Could take a couple weeks. For no name wallet like Coinomi w/e, forget about it. Instead if you have it in Core, everything is under your control. You can be the first one to split, send it to exchange, dump it for the highest price.

It will eventually fail because that's what we have Visa/PayPal for, not to mention there will be no incentive to mine after no block reward . Then alts that can resist centralization and people intervention may rise.
Decentralization, adoption are more important than those gimmick feature s, turing, privacy, etc. As technically, what any alts can do, smart guys in the valley can make it work on Bitcoin as well.

well, nobody is enforcing it now, but when someone or some organizations srart doing, i would be glad it happens, coz it will put pressure on devs and the community to realize a solution. Anyway I think semi fungibility makes a thing more worthy than fullon fungibility as most of the time traceability is a desired property. Solution like CT, not sure what it really is, should make btc much more interesting. As we know whatever alts can do bitc can do in theory, its just those problems that alts try to solve dont/hasnt existed, but when they do, smart men will make it work. Like those scaling debate, segwit, LN wouldnt be invented, if blocks werent full or kept increasing the limit

I really don't like the term early adopter as it's pretty vague. I'd like to compare put it in VC term. Imaging Bitcoin is a company of a new type of technology and we are share hodlers. What state we are in now ? Well, ETF isn't on, people buy bitcoin on obscured exchanges, localbitcoins, or dealers like coinbase. Tim Draper, wikelevous or w/e,  barry, and probably several others far vision billionaires took some interest. All my friends heard about btc but none of them buy in any significant. LN/Sidechain/real use cases are in the future. So judging from all that we are just in the state transforming from nerds (seed) to pro investors (Series A). Then Series B C D.... then IPO (mainstream)

Well we have halving in 2020. Every time there's always insane rally, 2023 could spark the one out of the next one. Then gold is 8T,  btc is the new gold that put us at least 100k. Then we are hoping for LN adoption to be a better cash/cc/electronic payment. It could take a while, but I guess 2021 or so I expect to have a LN card swipeable in mom and pop coffee shop. So new gold, new world preserved currency, halving, plus a couple wars / stock market crashing / US debt bailings should get us there more than million a coin

What is the plan ?
@_date: 2017-05-03 01:15:48

@_date: 2017-05-08 08:41:15
I guess 75% is enough to get the majority of people comfortable to USAF. We just have to beg Viabtc and a few other pools

Satoshi couldn't imagine the power of pool mining and the Chinese cartel. He thought that if Bitcoin can survive for 8 years, it will be very difficult for a few miners to corner the mining industry. He didn't think the westerners would give up mining this easy and delusionally thinking running a lot of full nodes is enough to maintain decentralization. Guys like dan from san diego are probably fictional characters
@_date: 2017-07-15 09:04:12
I predict, we will have segwit by this month regardless, then majority of miners will switch back to core not following thru the 2. ABC will remain Vaporware just like BU &amp; Yours

So they can mine larger empty blocks

Remember the guy has some thing called "tulip trust" with a girl and another guy, I guess it's a big stash of bitcoin holding in a multisig wallet between these three people.

Even if 148 doesn't succeed, it's a progress. There need to be pressure from 148 for a better chance for 149. But honestly, new users from wannacry creates a new level of pressure to fee &amp; mempool, I don't think we can wait until 149. Maybe we should have 148.5, like 149 but shorten the period

The ransomware objective is educating bitcoin to people, to pump the price, so that their stash is worth more. It's difficult to spend that 3 addresses when millions eyes are watching, but they got rich by pumping the price. Anyway it could be good fir those hacked, imagine those who bot some coin to pay for decryption, have some left, then 3 years later butt moonshot to 30k$, they wouldn't lose anything, some might even be profitable,

Pretty sure many white folks in the gringolandia of Kathmandu have bitcoin. They just don't bother trying to spend it, because it's obvious. Make buy offer on localbitcoin in person with a good rate or make bitcoin signs buying offer putting on windows of mountain gear shops and restaurants, some in need of cash might give you a call.

@_date: 2016-07-19 13:11:19
I did. I can tell you what will happen next. My prediction was price will stay in sideway range for the time being following by gradual rise, no moonshot, by shortage of coins on exchanges while the growth of demand remains the same. Bitcoin growth shouldn't be measured by price but the number of transaction.  . Right now we are about to hit the blocksize limit, but by Dec segwit will double the throughput keeping us on track. Then LN will unlock btc potential. Price in this stage is the speculation of future utility of btc. We won't land on the moon, until btc is as frictionless as Visa. In other word, LN adoption is more important than halving.
@_date: 2018-12-24 17:43:45
One problem involving holding many alts is that, when you move them out of exchanges, you have to secure all of them which isn't easy. For example I used to have separate OS / encrypted partitions for each alts, so that if one comes with backdoors or bugs( which is likely by the way), my other coins remain unaffected. However, it gets annoying, so at them I convert them all to btc and only maintain btc blockchain.
So if you have shitcoins on exchange, I suggest convert them to btc, install bitcoin core, make air gap OS cold storage or whatever. Being your own bank is already not easy. Being your own banks, good luck with that.

No, monero owes everything to Bytecoin. Bitcoin will eventually have confidential transaction. In theory, Bitcoin can add any features from any alts, if it has real use cases worth enough to be implanted into Bitcoin. Smart people like nullc, adam3us sure make it work. Because they know network effect is everything.

minimum of airbnb is $10 last time I checked. There are countries out there in the third world that $10+ a night is considered luxury. We might gain a niche market of providing accommodation at whatever price renter wants. For example, to me, when I'm traveling, I only need a sofar and bathroom or backyard for setting up hammock and some water and soap to wash my ass after shitting in a bush. So $2 a night, I'm all for it. This is not possible in airbnb.

what stop me from trying LN is I have to spend my btc to open a channel. If LN could do anything for me, sure I'll do it. I have some satoshi in lntip but eclair can't receive it yet. Even I pay to open channel I still can't get those satoshi out. I tried the bitcoin lightning wallet in android which can create invoice and accept payment, but it says I have to pay some storage fee for their server to maintain my channel or something.

What are the benefits over running mysql and anchor the doc hash on bitcoin ? Because fact chain is supposed to be decentralized right ? but not really. And in order to use that service people have to buy the coin. What prevent someone to start another blockchain and do the same thing ? Even if fact chain gets super popular, just to prove that a doc is unmodified doesn't need to be on fact chain, another competing chain like fart chain can serve the purpose if the token is a way cheaper. It's not like money that need to have value to measure the value of product or IOU.

Bitcoin core wallet. Encrypt wallet.dat a few more times with your favorite algors. Then back it up on USB, CD, sdcards, floppy, tapes. Bury them under birdbaths around the world.

@_date: 2017-07-19 11:33:54
Yes. Although mining and merchant support of UASF is tiny, it will make chainsplit, which nobody wants. Without UASF, NYA won't exist and we would remain stuck in deadlock. Small UASF support means it hold btc value hostage. Medium support or more means, you will fuck if you not follow.

How could the community support buying the mining equipments from a piece of trash like this Jihan in the first place . To be a good bitcoiner, one should check the background of whom to do business with, especially those mining manufacturers

Yes. I think segwit2x is meant to fuck big block miners after segwit activation. Silbert probably doesn't care, he just want segwit and get out of deadlock, then any miners can choose to support HF or not by switching software.

The thing that I don't get is. How can eth have so many nodes? Friend of my tried to sync the chain from the start, took him 3 months still stuck on some blocks. It's like trying to download torrent that no one willing to seed. So it's likely that meth network is on data center only mode

Probably because ant is closing door and mining is pretty centralized around them. This is good, it's like mtgox blowing up bringing new 100 exchanges to life

They created s2x to avoid uasf chain split, so anything that's controversial won't happen. So there's only one outcome. After seg lock in, most miners switch to core, no harm done
@_date: 2018-12-02 13:37:15
Is it possible to make a sidechain for this purpose? The sidechain could also enhance encryption algors?
@_date: 2018-12-27 08:42:02
in btc you get hacked by your own stupidity, in fiat you get robbed by corruption. Very simple, just do encryption, run core, back up, airgap, timelock, don't fuck around alts, etc, everyone should be fine. However if you store coins in exchanges, use blockshame.info, or trying to increase your stash by playing with alts, well, sorry for your loss in advance.

I can't care less of openbuttzaar. The way to convince people shopping with bitcoin is by paying on Amazon thru the lightning network, not by having all the merchants set up their shops on cloud and forcing shoppers to run openbutt software just to buy things. They probably spent half of the VC money making trolling videos on the hoeffman channel 
@_date: 2017-06-10 07:47:23
Or when you are ready, selling one btc can crash the entire market

Big block doesn't solve shit. It just to make everything more centralized. N tx is still N tx
