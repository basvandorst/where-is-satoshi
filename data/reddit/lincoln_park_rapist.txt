Ah I knew I couldn't be the first to think about this. I hope the organizers of last year's event are preparing to take advantage of the 1000-fold increase in attention and potential to really make an impact in mainstream acceptance. 
I only frequent r/bitcoin. Anyone familiar about this discussion taking place on other forums?

Thanks, that'll be useful. Especially the stickers. I guess I'll have to do some writing myself to gear it towards businesses and general information to a total newbie. I'll make another post asking for feedback about what I've written.

Don't worry. What happened just now is a healthy consolidation of a price range when the rate gets a little bit too fast for the short term trend. I believe whales are doing this because it tests supports before continuing the slightly longer term trend, which is most definitely backed by new money coming into the market through next week.

Dwolla already has a minimum balance feature (also free to transfer from bank to dwolla) along with instant and free transfer from dwolla to mtgox with a recurring payment option

The best part about all of this is that it can be gradually implemented just as the internet was gradually implemented. 
People didn't start adopting the internet because it was seen just as a curiousity and didn't have much practical use for the mainstream. It wasn't until people started using it more and more, that emergent properties began to emerge that gave advantages to the people who used the internet. Fast communication, access to previously unavailable knowledge, message boards, paperless mail, large databases and processing, content delivery, credit cards, youtube, facebook, and on and on. This is the next iteration of a process that has already been accelerating. 
There is inherent value and competitive advantages to the kinds of systems that the blockchain can run. I'll post the next part soon that outlines a very very exciting example of what's possible and how it can be implemented gradually.
