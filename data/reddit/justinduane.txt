Loose credit is what makes bubbles possible at all. The kind of bubbles that pop and wipe out everyone’s 401k. The ebb and flow of the market is where we get the information to course correct and avoid huge capital wasting. Loose credit muddies the signal and leads us down untenable capital uses.

It isn’t our place to stimulate it. If people want to buy products that no one is producing then there is an economic opportunity and credit will loosen for those endeavors with the most merit. Leading the market to false incentives made via too much credit is what leads to booms and busts.

Every year the FED targets ~2% inflation by manipulation of the money supply. The new money isn’t distributed evenly to all holders of USD so certain people benefit from the new supply before prices adjust. By the time you or I get any increased supply the prices have already adjusted and we lost purchasing power.
The FED steals 2% of your dollars every year.

This guy gets it! Probably a poor analogy but may be striking at the network affect is the internet.  I mean, one could argue that the internet's only value is the utility of the content on it, but that would be forgetting that the fact the network itself exists and has a massive utility for humans with respect to uses not associated with the content (like P2P information transfer or other applications)
That is to say, the fact that I can't eat gold (its content) is not relevent because of its utility as a money (its network) which is where the majority of its value is derived.

I think for a lot of politicians you just have to assume the worst. They actually don’t want long term growth and stability. They want power now. If you look through that lens a lot of their behaviors make more sense. 
If you want to be really charitable you can assume that the game is set up in such a way that their behaviors make sense as a general strategy.
For example, are you familiar with the bowl of money game? You take like 4 people and put a bowl with like 20 one dollar bills in it. Each round anyone can grab as much money as they can and they keep whatever they grab. If the bowl is empty the game is over. If there’s still money left at the end of the round the bowl gets filled up. 
Optimal strategy is leave money in the bowl each round to get a refill but what people do is make mad grabs to not get left out. Politicians do the same. If we had good policy we could all get rich but the political game is set up to grab as much as you can now do you don’t get left out.

I am in debt for 30 years but I also have an asset for that same period that not only often appreciates but also has a high utility for me and my family. Then when I die I can give it to my children and the wealth I generated by having a long time preference proceeds into the generations.

Oof, you're right re: time preference, I misspoke there.  What I mean is that the cost of high time preference in this case is low enough that in the long run I come out ahead.
I am not sure where you live but in my area to rent the living space I have now would cost as much (or more) so the additional benefit you mention re: renting simply doesn't apply in my situation.  I would much rather that money build equity in my asset (and cover the utility of a place to live, the interest on the debt, and the unique taxes I pay for being a property owner) than have that money go wholesale to a landlord, have no equity in an asset, yadda yadda.
It sounds like you are smart enough to recognize the situation you're in and I think we both agree it can make sense depending on that situation and one's level of desire for debt to buy a home or not. I'll leave it there. Good luck, dude! ;)

Also, if there was a difference, like between a freshly printed dollar bill and one that was stored in my underwear, then it's fungibility couldn't be null, because it is an example of fungibility at all.

Because all existing coins are the “supply” in the phrase “supply and demand”. 
If you wanted to buy a wedding band would you ask a jeweler when he expects more gold to be mined, or would you ask to see his selection of existing stock?

They don’t wait for a block reward and try to bid for it every ten minutes.

You’re claim is that the supply of Hope Diamonds on Earth is zero because there aren’t any for sale.

Existing stock is part of the supply. If added supply is all that was meant by “supply” then once bitcoin reached 21 million then by definition the supply would be zero (because there is no added supply).

First of all "helping the economy" is no one's responsibility. Go get the products and services you want/need for the best prices you can find and you'll be participating in the economy.
If you are worried about people keeping their money instead of spending it why don't you offer something they really want so they spend it now instead of later? Also, hoarding increases purchasing power for everyone else so be sure you thank a hoarder for not flooding the economy with currency, lowering demand and raising prices.

You’re right. But as the pie is subdivided further and further and more divisions are lost (eaten?) then the remaining pieces increase in value (assuming there is still use for an indelible ledger of transfer).

If a company decides to print its ingredients list on their food and everyone follows suit, it doesn't need to be codified.

This is a good thing. Once the manipulation of the money supply is out of their grasp we can move towards more and more liberty until it’s revealed we never needed them to begin with.
Less war, less wasted economic activity, more innovation and less wealth squandering. More productive output in the hands of its rightful owners. So much to be gained. Bitcoin is literally Moses breaking the Pharaoh’s yoke.

Price inflation also masks any deflationary activity as well.
Assume you’re targeting 2% price inflation and some new technology cuts the price of an everyday object in half or more (imagine computer prices as one example). That gives the Fed lots of room to inflate way past 2% because the price reduction on the basket of goods counterbalances the price inflation caused by monetary inflation.

Money is a fantastic invention. It lets highly advanced economies exist. In a post-apocalypse Mad Maxian hellscape gold could still function as a commodity money but less likely because the capital necessary to utilize gold wouldn’t likely exist. Whatever became money generally would also need to be a commodity. 
Batteries, bullets, cigarettes, liquor, even things like porno mags. Things that can be divided into small units (divisibility), are mostly interchangeable (fungibility), and last a long time in relatively the same condition can be money. The commodity part is that they are useful in themselves as themselves. So a cigarette in jail can be traded for a small bag of chips, wagered in a chess match, or smoked. A commodity money.

When the loan is created the numbers in an account are simply changed on the bank’s ledger. The bank doesn’t go into a vault and move gold bars or cash from their drawer to his. They simply generate numbers. 
When the house is transferred they remove those numbers from his or her account and then add them to your account (with them or another bank) but the loan was created out of thin air.
Because banks have reserve requirements below 100%, they all are in the practice of generating money out of thin air.

The Keynesian outlook is that inflation is necessary to grease the wheels but it assumes every consumer is of equal and infinite constitution and only wants to hold money over all other goods/services.
If you have a deflationary currency but you need insulin shots, or food, or new tires, or rent is due, or you really want that new game that just dropped, you’re gonna spend it. And every consumer’s tolerance for waiting for the best value is different. I mean look at credit cards. I tell my friends all the time that buying that $100 thing on credit is gonna cost $115 overall. But they do it anyway instead of waiting for the $100 in savings. The deflationary terror assumes that a nation with billions in consumer debt has the wherewithal to hold their currency until tomorrow. They don’t. The economy would soldier on.

Friedman is wrong. Take a second to think about the claim that deflationary money will lead to hoarding and a stagnant economy. 
Consuming on credit is exactly this premise. I want to consume now but if I wait until tomorrow it will be cheaper. Except consumer credit is terribly high so no one waiting. 
People want things when they want them (or need them). Telling someone that their insulin will be cheaper tomorrow is a nonstarter.
The claim that everyone will be disciplined savers is laughable when we can empirically see that if given the option most people consume now.

Specifically what happens is the Federal Reserve, which holds accounts of banks, “buys” an asset from that bank and pays by adding zeroes (or whatever amount) to that bank’s account (literally making money from thin air).
This also happens when commercial banks make loans. Because they are practicing fractional reserve banking they don’t walk to the vault and count out your loan amount in deposited cash/coin. They just change the number next to your name on their balance sheet. Again, creating money out of thin air.
Bitcoin is absolutely necessary because these people will not stop on their own.

Bitcoin has built-in scarcity so its supply cannot be manipulated devaluing its purchasing power. It's price relative to USD (or other fiats) is currently speculation by some purchasers expecting to get a quick (or long term) return against those assets.
Fiat currencies are always (by design) devaluing against goods and services and Bitcoin (by design) will not.
Fiats are the de jure currency so their gravity will distort asset values relative to themselves (hence current volatility) but as Bitcoin adoption increases their pull will wane and in a world of Bitcoin as world currency simply holding Bitcoin would be a solid and safe savings option.
The meme of keeping money under the matress is a holdover from the gold standard.  If you could trade bank notes for gold then holding them would be fine because gold has friction associated with increasing its supply (mining costs, smelting, minting, warehousing, etc.) and so doesn't have infation issues that fiat has.
Holding fiat for long term savings is a losing proposition.

Because if his idea is good then his reward would be much higher than the deflationary value of the currency used to acquire the necessary capital. 
Entrepreneurs would be constantly looking for ways to get tight-fingered currency hoarders to let go of some of their money. 
It’s like saying Bill Gates only started Microsoft because he was afraid of losing 2% on his cash holdings. I don’t buy it. His motivation was either a much larger reward, or to make something great, neither of which are influenced by his cash being worth a fraction more tomorrow. 
I’ll grant that on the margins some would-be entrepreneurs would keep their desk job, say, rather than strike out and start that restaurant or brewery or whatever else their dream is, but even then I would argue it isn’t worth the trade off of centralizing so much power in quasi-private banks to have a few more small businesses.

I didn’t say inflation means shit gets cheaper. I said deflation means shit gets cheaper tomorrow (due to increased purchasing power)
Claiming that deflation causes stagnation via hoarding (because people are incentivized to save) is the same as saying “no one would buy anything on credit because they could just save up and it would be cheaper”.
But the fact that there is massive consumer credit debt shows us that if given the option to save up and buy later or buy now at a higher rate people buy at the higher rate now. Hoarding isn’t a good argument against deflationary currency.

To what end would they force lower prices? According to your argument any price point would still be lower tomorrow so no one buys anything ever and starves to death. 
See you’re still stuck with admitting that at some point the market would be attractive enough to a hoarder to break tradition and start buying things. And it would happen at every level, from near-rotten to freshly-gilded bananas. 
Since every single person has a different tolerance for delayed gratification, different needs (if you have diabetes you aren’t hoarding your bitcoins for cheaper insulin tomorrow because tomorrow you’re dead), and different desires (Warren Buffet probably doesn’t eat at Del Taco too often even though he could eat way more efficiently if he eats at The Four Seasons). The economy will settle into equilibrium with those wanting currency hoarding the exact amount they are comfortable with and those wanting products and services buying the exact amount they want and entrepreneurs doing their best to allocate capital in ways that keep both types of people interacting with the marketplace. As long as those entrepreneurs continue to innovate then the market and economy will grow, even with deflationary currency.

Deflation makes it so no one spends money and causes the economy to decline. To avoid a grind to a halt we need an slight inflationary currency to induce spending. If currency is deflationary then there is never incentive to spend it because tomorrow it will be worth more. 
If I am getting that wrong let me know. 
What it forgets is that people have a time preference. Meaning, I want a banana now, not 1.25 bananas tomorrow. Hence, simply stating that deflationary currency is bad for economic growth ignores time preference. You are ignoring time preference. Your argument against deflation ignores time preference. Time preference and deflation are related insofar as you are ignoring time preference while arguing against deflation.

The requirement to use their currency isn’t the violent part. The requirement to pay at all is.

The number one currency for crimes is USD! When they raided El Chapo’s mansion they found USD, not bitcoin wallets and very little other currencies in comparison.

Those are some great arguments. I am definitely rethinking my earlier statement. Thanks for the deep and meaningful insights.

The bridge was just a troll reference. Haha. 
Money in general is super useful, so anything that offers that function is gonna have value. We trade dollars because there is a pretty good possibility that America will be here in the near future. But people don’t denominate their long term wealth in USD. They mostly do it in stocks because there is a virtual guarantee ( the Fed targeting inflation) the USD is gonna be devalued in the long term. 
USD definitely has the value you describe and won’t go away soon (at least in my estimation). I was just commenting on how at the base of it the value is due to violence and not any intrinsic quality of this particular money.

First you said no re: my claim of gunpoint, then you said yeah it is like a protection racket.
Which is it? Also, that you’re happy to pay a mugger doesn’t mean they don’t have you at gunpoint.
EDIT: also, that your happy doesn’t mean everyone is or should be. You can only speak for yourself.

I don’t know enough about QC to say but your post reminds me of the “what if the grid fails and you lose your money” argument.

You’ve described marginal utility! A cornerstone of subjective value theory. And as accurate a description of economic value as I’ve heard. :)

Never mind that his cost of living goes down relative to the money he controls through utilizing his farm to actually produce in ways he never could without the loan. 
Deflation is only a problem if you want to use inflation to indirectly tax your citizens. Or if you make bad business decisions and can’t produce more than the terms of your loan or take out loans to consume instead of to produce.

Certainly. But those frequently come with heavy liens against them in the form of mortgages.
I live in Orange County CA and see million dollar homes all over my commute to work, but I’m guessing few of the residents own them outright.

My position is you (and any humiliated poor) lack perspective. Medieval Kings shit in a hole in the wall that ran down the side of their brick house (castle). Starvation was somewhat of a real concern even for the well to do, one bad harvest could kill your whole family. 
Paycheck to Paycheck insinuates one has a job. Which in and of itself should be a source of pride. Also no medival kings had dollar stores. It's practically a miracle that you can purchase such a wide variety of goods for a fraction of your productive capacity. People used to work 14 hour days just to eat and not freeze to death in their sleep. Now we work 8 hours a day for internet and supercomputers in our pockets. A going concern for modern people is to try to not eat too much. Think about that. Most of human history has been a struggle against starvation. Now we throw away food because we already ate too much of it.

I don’t know that they’re evil as such. But their utility is extremely narrow. And after the first couple their marginal utility drops off a cliff.
A free market with sound money would have very few weapons of war in it, methinks. You’d have to be an extremely wealthy hobbyist, haha.

Awesome. Appreciate the additional clarity. Fun stuff!

History must have had good kings. I think a free market monarchy is a better system overall than a democracy.

I wonder if those sanctions had anything to do with WWI. It’s almost as if WWI was the cause of WWII!
I know I’m being overly glib and as mentioned by another commenter, simplistic, but I really think any more complex explanations for WWII really do boil down to WWI.
@_date: 2019-05-11 03:08:23

Long term do you think there would be a service, like a consumer rating, of exchanges with the lowest rate of “bad inputs”?

Send a bitcoin to their wallet with the express agreement that they give it back and maybe more depending on the terms.  
Same way you loan someone your jacket or a book. Good news is bitcoin is fungible so they don't have to give you that same bitcoin back...  they can give you a different one. :P
@_date: 2018-12-22 17:49:07
Exactly this. It’s really funny to me how few people realize the only fiat money that’s there’s is the cash in their hand. 
@_date: 2018-12-13 02:42:57
Interest is just the cost of time preference. I really have no idea what that rate should be because of the situation you describe. 
But anyway, I think your concern is valid because unless the creditor is actually giving coins in exchange for agreements then we’re talking about non-chain transactions which defeats the point. 
@_date: 2018-12-31 15:59:10
Yeah Mt Gox is essentially a victory *against* bitcoin being risky. 
If you don’t like the Mt Gox situation then why do you warehouse all your USD in a company designed exactly like it? I’ll never understand it. 
Not your keys, not your Bitcoin. Not your cash, not your money. The digits on your bank account ledger are bank liabilities... the cash you deposited isn’t yours... it’s a bank asset. We need a solid bank run and failure to drive home the concept to people.

The major difference is growth vs income companies. If a company can take what would be, say a 1% dividend payment and reinvest it to improve the stock price 2% that is better for shareholders than paying the dividend. As a company ages and growth becomes harder and harder, they’ll switch to paying dividends because a reinvest isn’t going to give the same return. 
@_date: 2019-05-07 03:26:41
Thanks for the explanation. Does that mean that if all bitcoin was sent to one wallet, then that wallet sent all the bitcoin to another wallet, the chainstate would be one transaction?
@_date: 2019-05-09 21:00:22
Couldn’t be more clear, right?
@_date: 2018-12-31 17:50:59
I suppose it depends on your definition of money but yes, Fed notes aren’t exchangeable for gold or other commodity money.
However if someone will accept Fed notes in exchange then if I’m holding them the bank can’t stop the transaction (my money) whereas they can stop me if all I am doin is asking them to reduce my ledger balance and increase another party’s (their money).

So do these coins just bounce around into known wallets forever until they pass to a known entity and get recovered or do they get laundered somehow?
