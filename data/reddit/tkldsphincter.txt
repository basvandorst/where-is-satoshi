I don't have a background in economics so this is all based on what I'm aware of. Within a closed system yes, which is what inflation is about. If too much money is created and the amount of goods remain the same, then the price of the goods will increase, because the value of the money has gone down. (this can happen if the Federal Reserve in the USA, for ex. makes some sort of "miscalculation"). 
The thing with Cryptocurrency is that, it allows people to create money of the thin air. Because our current economic system is based on someone making money at the expense of someone losing money. If I sell something for 500$ all is well and stable, because there is a 0 net transaction. If I buy 500$ worth of bitcoins and make 1000$, then I've literally added 500$ to the economic system, which should result in some inflation. The "issue" is that bitcoin is difficult to trace and unpredictable, so the economic system that is in place now has to play catchup. I hope that makes sense

Capitalism never expected the internet. You can't have both without upgrading the economic system. Currently, we have Bitcoin, this virtual currency that is as valuable as people attribute it to be. If Bitcoin goes the route of people collectively putting money into Bitcoin, collectively watching it increase, and therefore justifying putting more money into it, rinse and repeat. Then, it will make everyone rich, which will fuck up this current system. You can't have stability within an economic system and money being made through an external source, outside of the current system; because then the value of money stays the same while the quantity of it increases. I think changing the current economy is the ultimate end goal of Bitcoin.

I'm watching a video as I type this about a Bitcoin ATM I want to buy. It sounds like a wicked business. Go to nearby stores, agree to run it there, split profits

Don't underestimate the government currently tracking millions of people. I believe they're already on this

That website makes me too happy. To think there's a bunch of people out there cheering BTC on so that McAfee could eat his dick, is what makes me proud to be human.

Ya, I'm still not convinced that the government/big CEOs lost control of this crypto situation and is working to make it work. No. The world is run by rich and powerful people, who's ancestors or themselves, potentially communicated and have a financial head start combined with some luck. It's not difficult to use money to influence the world... Especially if you and your friends are in high power positions. If crypto was not in their plan it wouldn't exist. It was LITERALLY stated by the economist magazine in 1988. Crypto is to make people think they're in control, or some effort by a government Organisation to own the global currency. One day crypto will work against us. It's inevitable, power and money wins.

As an Ontarian I thought the same. I was like...damn this is way too close to home. Clearly whoever named our cities is a lazy fucker. London/Durham/Scarborough/Toronto/Vancouver...
