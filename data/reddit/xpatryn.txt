QuadrigaCX offers instant deposits via interac online. Verification is usually done same day. Very low fees. 
QuadrigaCX has been up and running since December 2013. They were the first bitcoin exchange in Canada to receive an MSB by FinTRAC. Have a very strong community presence, hosting the Vancouver Bitcoin Co-Op weekly meets and numerous bitcoin related events in Vancouver throughout 2014. 
Daily volume now sees this exchange going between  in Canada on BitcoinAverage. Over 30 ATMs placed throughout Canada, offices in both downtown Vancouver and Toronto, with founders who are very active in the Bitcoin scene. Industry leading deposit and withdrawal options, customer support, and I believe the only trading platform in Canada which does not overlap bid/ask orders prior to processing.

I would have thought that your mom would be most comfortable walking into the Bitcoiniacs/QuadrigaCX/Coinwaves office and buying there. Does your mom prefer an ATM to a bank teller?

What? There is usually a less than a 5% discrepancy between spot rate and numerous LocalBitcoins traders in Vancouver. I'm looking at $920-947 CAD right now ($820 USD + 2-5%).
@_date: 2014-01-05 13:35:12
There are only two exchanges where you can sell for CAD. Accounting for their trading fees, yes it is easily possible to convert without currency exchange fee. I've been doing it for quite awhile. 
@_date: 2014-05-13 13:49:12
Unfortunately, most of us lack the engineering background and/or appropriately qualified associates to retrofit/modify a $2000 regular ATM to work with bitcoin. Know of any blueprints or anyone near Vancouver who may be interested in working on such a project? Also, most ATMs do not count cash when you make a deposit... a necessary feature for bitcoin ATMs.
@_date: 2014-01-24 02:00:08
Only CAD is "legal tender" in Canada. Has nothing to do with legitimacy, acceptance, or legality. Your question is answered by looking up the definition of the term "legal tender":
"Any official medium of payment recognized by law that can be used to extinguish a public or private debt, or meet a financial obligation."

I love articles about what companies plan to do, as opposed to what they are actually doing. Particularly as most of them never seem to reach said plans, particularly in this space. 
Considering the insane amount of Circle promo at this Bitcoin2014 event, I hope that they will actually provide something soon.

There is a high fee surcharge for "same day". It states this on the website, but seems to fail to mention what this fee is about on the fees page. I see no mention of a $90+ surcharge for same day bank of America? 
@_date: 2014-01-31 04:49:57
No. Our price is actually $17 cheaper than VoS. We are $20 lower than the only other ATMs in the province. Perhaps the price gap you're seeing has more to do with a quick price fluctuation, or you're looking at VoS's USD order book. There is currently an 11% difference between the value of USD and CAD. Our ATM is priced in CAD, for obvious reasons.
Current price on VoS: $873 CAD + 0.5% commission = $877.36.
Current price on Virtex: $883 CAD + 1.5% commission = $896.24.
Current price on QuadrigaCX: $860 CAD + 0.0% commission = $860 CAD.
@_date: 2014-01-06 12:45:39
You are correct in that Bitcoin fees are overpriced for quick confirming  small purchases such as a $2 coffee or bag of chips. However, if you wanted to purchase something for say, $100+, bitcoin has vastly lower fees compared to any merchant account. 
Edit: Actually, my mistake. Standard spend fee is 0.0001 bitcoins, or ten cents. Hardly overpriced. Bitcoin is not the best currency for purchasing bubble gum... and I see no reason why you would need to wait for all of those confirmations when purchasing a packet of crisps. Someone who can manage to pull off a double spend would likely go for a larger score.
@_date: 2014-01-19 07:41:33
Did that. Was about as true as when it was posted in October here:
So what's going on? Did you guys even order one?
@_date: 2014-10-19 13:43:13


1. Press Start. 
2. Scan QR code. 
3. Insert bills and confirm amount.
4. Press Send to receive bitcoins.  
This is roughly the process to purchase bitcoins from a lamassu, sky hook, or bitxatm machine. Really shouldn't take ten minutes. They really have made this quite user friendly.

Two weeks later, still no issues from other BMO-using bitcoin businesses. Either this is a very delayed enforcement, or CoinTrader was targeted for some reason. Possibly the large cash deposit volume from the ATM raising flags?

You did state above that you've already launched, right? After having spent 1.5 years making your compliance and licensing airtight, and launching in the US, why can't you provide any details?
I seriously hope for all of your clients sake, that you are properly licensed in the US.
@_date: 2014-01-05 13:27:41
Please post details regarding the regulations of which you speak.

7.5x as much as BTC-E, 5-7.5x as much as Bitstamp and Bitfinex, 3x as much as everyone else (Gox, vault of satoshi, kraken etc). 
And breaking the 400 coin 120 day barrier results in a price reduction from 1.5% to 1.4%. Every other exchange charges 0.2%-0.5%. 
@_date: 2014-01-24 01:41:15
Wait, did he put up the ATM, or will it be put up later at the pizza place? Article is a bit contradictory. Didn't the Winnipeg coinfest guys purchase a bitaccess ATM?
Also, article states that they can withdraw to cash. The Lamassu ATM pictured does not support withdrawals to cash. 
Another fine piece of reporting. 
@_date: 2014-06-17 20:48:27
*&gt; For at least the last few weeks their phone didn't work. No ringing, no nothing. I tried to use their contact form but that didnt work either. They didn't notice because they don't have any customer support and no one answering the phone for weeks is completely normal.*
The office manager, Aaron, has been at the office 9-5 for the last two weeks. No support e-mail should have gone more than a few hours without response, perhaps a technical issue took place? We have offered intermittent telephone support in the past, but have increased our support staff since then and will continue to do so. I apologize for any inconvenience which may have been caused.

What "list for a Lamassu" are you referring to? 
@_date: 2014-10-15 13:41:08


Mandatory for the purchase of a Bitcoin ATM from any of the five major providers.
@_date: 2014-01-28 03:56:19
I believe the OP is referring to the ability to deposit and withdraw USD, not Bitcoin. The government does regulate fiat. No grey zone there.
@_date: 2014-08-05 14:30:35
You aren't transferring the cash. You're hiring a third party company to do so. The third party company offers insurance and chargebacks. You did not transfer cash by initiating an ACH.

It sounds like you've been going to the wrong office. 140-332 Water Street. Aaron is there as we speak, as he has been 9-5 since QCX hired him. He puts up a "back in 5/10/15" sign during bathroom/lunch breaks, perhaps you missed the sign? 
Yes, once back when we only scheduled office visits by appointment, staff were booked for the day. You were offered the opportunity to, instead, drop off the check during a social event. You CHOSE this option and received prompt funding. 
@_date: 2014-05-22 19:50:31
Checking, debit cards, access to tellers, etc is all free in the US. It sounds like you may be using one of the few banks not offering such services. Try any of the larger banks: Bank of America, Chase, Wells Fargo, etc etc etc.
As for increasing store of value, tell that to anyone who purchased at 1200, 1100, 1000, 900, 800, 700, etc... Faith/hope that it will one day rise to that point again doesn't pay the bills.

Good to hear that their system automatically resolved the issue which their poorly trained support staff would not. 
@_date: 2014-04-03 16:55:59
Likely because there are no costly compliance rules in Canada. The ATM provider is gouging you for a combination of profit and to pay the venue. 
2% fee QuadrigaCX ATM
3% fee Bitcoiniacs ATM
Similar fees for most brokers and ATMs on the west coast. The east coast does not have additional compliance laws for this for which the west coast gets a pass. 
Bitcoiniacs used to charge double digits as well. Complaints and competition brought it down. Fabricating excuses does not. 
@_date: 2014-06-30 16:27:14
I've heard of others having this issue, namely at the BMO branches in Vancouver and Montreal. I suggest filing a complaint with your Ombundsman or obsi. While I don't expect favourable resolution, it will bring some attention to this issue.
@_date: 2014-10-05 13:04:53


Generally, coins purchased at localbitcoins etc are purchased at a premium, not a discount. At least in my experience going by North America and much of western europe. I believe the US Marshals coins were also purchased at a premium over market price.
@_date: 2014-07-29 13:31:29
QuadrigaCX does not require any ridiculous verification. Selfies are only required if you wish to use a deposit method which leaves the company at heavy risk of fraud, such as interac online.

@_date: 2014-07-17 21:16:05
I believe the issue was licensing, not cash. VoS is now registered to operate in several states. The issue now is lack of volume.

Their TOS clearly states that despite calling themselves a "New York company", that they are an Ontario Canada company.
@_date: 2014-01-28 12:31:17
You realize that they make a small (2-5%) commission on the trades, they aren't just pocketing all 15 XBT and giving the user nothing in return? At that commission rate, the ATM would take years to pay for itself. Which is commendable if the goal was to spread bitcoin adoption as opposed to earning a profit. 
In Vancouver, traders move 15 XBT before they finish their morning coffee. I guess i'm used to the standard over here. It's great to see Zurich getting involved.

@_date: 2014-04-29 13:12:56

Circle works with most Canadian credit cards. You will end up with a currency conversion fee, unless your CC is in USD, along with a ~3% commission. The three major exchanges in Canada all accept interac online, which is instant and cheaper...
@_date: 2014-01-11 12:02:35
A discount of 10-20% for a tiny bulk order is fairly substantial. I would say that the average individual would be willing to pay slightly above your localbitcoins price.
@_date: 2014-01-04 12:58:12
Refusing to process your USD withdrawal for 4+ months unless you pay a 5% additional fee "for  manual processing" is pretty criminal to me. Would not be tolerated from any other reasonable business.

Sounds like you've got your exchanges mixed up.
CoinTrader had their BMO account shut down, and claimed that this was due to a new decision by BMO to shut down all bitcoin-related business accounts. This was two weeks ago. The other Canadian exchanges still seem to have accounts in good standing with BMO.

At HSBC, TD, and BMO in downtown Vancouver: You do not require ID to open your safety deposit box. Name or number, signature, and key.

I don't see why not. Bitcoin price tanks more than you expected, you don't have enough fiat in the exchange and don't want to risk the price jumping back up during the 1-2 business days it takes to get your wire in. You hit the ATM. 
One example of that would have been today's crash. Price dropped to $725 for a few. Back up now. Moved too quickly to wait for a wire.

The current 2-3 exchanges share the domestic 500ish coins per day traded. At half of a percent each way, that's rough $36k worth of revenue shared between them.

You are not converting one type of fiat for another. FinTRAC has made official statements that your business model is not considered an MSB.  
Here is one of hundreds of articles found regarding this. Google fintrac bitcoin. This really should not be news to you. 
"FINTRAC's letter went out to a number of Bitcoin exchanges in Canada, including LibertyBit, who were becoming nervous following developments in America.
The letter said: "Your entity is not, at this time, engaged as a money services business in Canada as per the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing and its associated Regulations.
"In fact, your entity doesn’t provide the services of remitting and/or transferring funds for the sake of the service. The transfer of funds is simply a corollary of your actual service of buying and selling virtual currency. Therefore, you do not have to register your entity with us."

I've been verified with them for quite some time... Did you click on the "verify" button after uploading your docs, or ask support about the delay? VoS would require a loss from currency exchange fees in both directions, and isn't a viable option for most of us yet due to their lack of volume. 
I'm also verified with VoS. Waiting hours to have a reasonable order filled because the exchange has a volume of under 2 coins per hour also isn't acceptable in this highly volatile market.

You posted a link for MSBs in Canada. Fintrac has already officially stated that a company buying/selling bitcoins in Canada, or offering such exchanges, is not an MSB. There are no exchanges in Canada with an MSB. There are no rules in place in Canada for this, and no, they do not NEED to do this.
@_date: 2013-09-17 23:55:47
Sounds like you need to do more research. According to FinTRAC, your business model is not as MSB. Also, how do you plan on avoiding these banking issues?
Note that your largest local competitor, Virtex, is not as MSB. They are also having banking issues despite what their articles states. I have been trying to fund my account with a 10k wire for two weeks. I keep being asked to wait as they do not have a bank account where they can receive wires.

Go to any legitimate currency exchange store, one which holds an MSB, and convert $2900 cad to another currency. You will not be asked for anything.

Not true. I hold an MSB and am bound by Fintrac regulations, while Bitcoiniacs are not. Have you ever conducted a &lt;$3000 transaction at a  currency exchange? You are not asked for ID etc "just in case" you come back later to exchange more with another rep or after shift change. Even an MSB is not required to do this, the Bitcoiniacs were denied an MSB.

After factoring in exchange rates and fees, there has been less than a 1-2% arbitrage opportunity between Virtex and BTC-E during the last week. 
Prior to that: Yes, Virtex was substantially cheaper. 
Virtex currently $901 CAD / $845 USD
BTC-E: $867
Bitstamp: 868
As Virtex charges me more than 7 times the commission as the others (1.5% vs 0.2%)...
However, one major plus is that despite Canadian exchanger claims to the contrary, it is incredibly cheap to send funds to Virtex at $5 for a $9999 bill pay. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 14:38:01
Their "daily rate" conversion includes a 1-2% spread over spot rate, as their commission. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 17:38:29

Indeed. It seems as though the value of XBT on Virtex launched over the last two days. Including conversion, bitcoins on Virtex now cost more than on any of the other major exchanges... which makes my points regarding the pricing/value of purchasing bitcoins using the ATM, which for some inexplicable reason uses a Bitstamp value, moot.
As for the LocalBitcoins ads, the ones on the first page are incomplete. I was able to find four additional sellers within the Vancouver downtown core on LocalBitcoins, priced within 2% of the Bitstamp auto conversion. If you are comparison shopping, I suggest looking at it in more detail so as to get yourself the best possible rate.


What was the current value of bitcoins on the ATM when you pulled up these prices from Virtex and Localbitcoins?

Very useful for those who want to pay higher fees and provide a palm print, picture etc. The Waves is located in an area with dozens of localbitcoin ads where you could save roughly 10% over what is charged by the ATM, and despite the machine being in Canada, accepting Canadian dollars, and trading on Virtex: You are further gouged by the ATM as it charges you Bitstamp rate, poorly converted into CAD. Instead of simply charging the Virtex ask rate. 
Virtex was $200 and the machine asked $220 when I was last there. Localbitcoin ads were mostly 198-205 at the time. It's an interesting PR vehicle/gimmick. The ATMs would be more useful in areas where purchasing bitcoins is actually difficult due to a lack of local exchangers. 
@_date: 2013-10-29 07:16:04
You don't find this a little excessive for mere identification? No bank require this much of us. In fact, most of us have never been asked to provide our palm print to anyone before. Palm, ID card, and picture? Excessive. Very excessive. That is the complaint.

They have been informing me that it will take "approximately 2 more weeks" to process my usd wire withdrawal since early August. After two months of complaining, I was informed that it really will be processed in two weeks if I pay an additional 5% manual processing fee. Thieves.

Go to any currency exchange in canada. Exchange $2900 CAD for USD. They do not require any identification from you "to identify you" so that you don't come back later to exchange more. They hold MSBs, and even they do not require an ID copy, let alone your prints and picture.

4/5 of the banks at BTC-China seem to disagree with you. 
* Industrial and Commercial Bank of China will not 
* China Construction Bank will not 
* Agricultural Bank of China will not 
* China Merchants Bank will not 
Bank of China doesn't seem to want to give me a straight answer regarding opening a personal account there, though they are very receptive to the idea of my opening a business account. However, apparently there is a $50k USD equivalent limit per year for outgoing CNY transfers?

Depending on where you live, you could find someone local willing to purchase them at cost. I routinely conduct such transactions in Vancouver. Walk into bank with client, client to client transfer to your account or fresh bank draft handed over. Bitcoins sent.

CampBX is also in the US, and trusted.

Tried it. Pretty interface, no volume. Will be nice when people start using it.

I was under the impression that BTC China only allowed funds to be traded between RMB and BTC, only supporting a handful of banks in china? No international wires etc. 
I don't see how they are a valid alternative for most of us.
