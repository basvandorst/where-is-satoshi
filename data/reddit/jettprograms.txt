The giftcard number? I wouldn't mind at that point, as I would intend to drain it. Really, I'm just looking for any solution to this.

It's looking like a giftcard would be my best option, but I can't find any website that would absolutely 100% work. They accept Visa cards but I'm not sure if that means that, without a doubt, I could use a giftcard. And it's not worth it to me just to "try," I'd much rather be certain.

It appears to be invite-only and in the earlier stages of life. Is it safe/am I going to be able to signup without an invite code?

so, shouldn't your bought be sell sell selling those 20 bitcoins since it's anticipating a drop?
@_date: 2011-06-30 03:34:02
certainly. and it's not very difficult, either.

This is true. The entire protocol is well-known. You don't open your PC up to intruders by connecting to a chat client.

I'm smelling some bullshit.

Regarding your mutual fund:
Write the algo and implement it. Give it fake money. Let it run for a month, report back results, and you're sure to find a way to implement fees and sell it to the community. You'd have to keep it live (otherwise you could be forging when you're buying/selling).
Get our trust with that and you'd probably have some of us on board.

similar to stocks, however, how am i guaranteed to be making my money back even while investing in the coins?
i'd much rather invest in hardware that i could actually use in the event of a 'crash' of sorts. the fact that deepbit is almost at 50% is a scary thought to me, considering what that could entail. with mt. gox almost entirely controlling the trade, also, it's scary to me.

i'm showing that the 5770 will do ~160Mh/s. i'm doing 100Mh/s right now.
i have an old gaming rig with a dead graphics card in it. (AMD 3700+ as the processor, LANParty mobo). would it be a 'good idea' to buy a 5870, for example, for $390 and throw it in there, getting ~300Mh/s?
i only ask because i'm not sure of what sort of a bottleneck i could potentially get myself in to. i know it doesn't tax the CPU too heavily, but i'm just wondering if i'm going to need to build an entirely new rig all together to keep with the times.
