Slow down there Futurama... 2000s was the "internet/web guy".  90s was "computer guy".

Anyone who did that would completely negate any value in the bitcoin blockchain in one fell swoop.

Yes... because banks, for years, have been told by the more vocal bitcoiners how stupid they are.  They love that.  They'll be jumping on that tech right away!

Why such hate for Ripple?  It's fantastic tech.  1000% faster than bitcoin.

not mined.  never mined... so no such thing as 'pre-mine'.

"common vernacular now" - you're right.  Common to you and I.  Most people still don't even know what bitcoin or any other digital/crypto-currency is though.
@_date: 2014-06-12 20:18:34
'enemy of Bitcoin' - there it is again.  Freedom of currency as long as you use OUR currency.
This enemy of bitcoin has allowed a bank to integrate it's protocol, and that bank is using that protocol (among other things) for access to bitcoin.  Why would your enemy enable your currency to larger and larger audiences?
'repulsive woman' - That's just petty.  You're better than that.

Maybe Jed McCaleb +can help you out... I know he's still involved with court proceedings and the such so maybe he has access to those through some proxy or something.

"The detained include a man and his wife, who operated the site, and **one of their suppliers.**"
haha, like drugs.

Good point.
@_date: 2014-06-12 20:13:43
It's their technology... why can't they own it?  Why does every crypto-currency have to have mining capabilities and free distribution to everyone?  There are no rules in this game yet.  
Bitcoiners are always there to say, "freedom of currency....as long as it's Bitcoin."

^ haha this.

There's posts like that every day on the front page talking about building the economy and better ways to reach a broader audience.  Bitcoin has an image problem if this is the reaction to constructive discussion.   Like it or not, the face of Bitcoin right now is the Winklevoss twins...

Your post is so full of FUD statements, it's just silly.
"to get people to buy into a ridiculous premine"  - Ripple Labs has never asked anyone to buy into XRP, in fact, they've been very clear to not speculate on it.  
"They bought some other guy's technology." - Also incorrect, the 'other guy' co-founded the company himself along with other people.
"...and they got rich." - Still untrue... no one at Ripple Labs is rich.  No one there has sold anything so no one there at Ripple Labs is rich.
"some of the founders appear to be cashing out." - Honestly this is exhausting... ONE of the founders, who was forced out of the company is taking his ball and going home, is cashing out.

There's plenty of posts of how to aspire to be bitcoin, and how to gain a wider audience.  I see your point, but it looks like the tone you're criticizing isn't in this particular post.  "why you should care" is in the title, not "why coin a is better than coin b"... it's all in how you receive it I guess.  
It's been fun!

What acered says simply isn't true.  4 things wrong in one single post.   
Syncing a node takes less than 3 hours on regular hardware.  IF you feel the need to verify every transaction yourself (as in you don't understand the mathematics behind verifying root hashes of the block instead) then this will take 2 weeks on normal hardware.    
Yes, you do have to pay a tx fee.  Why is this different from any other decentralized system?   You don't need anyone's manual intervention to send a tx on Ethereum.  Bitcoin still doesn't allow decentralized token issuance and transfer, so Ethereum is the platform to use for such utility tokens.

Growing up, one of our friend's stepdad would lecture us on whatever we were getting in trouble with and end it with "EXCLAMATION POINT" while drawing the line with a fist and then punching at the air for the 'point' part. 
It'll always be 'point' for me.
