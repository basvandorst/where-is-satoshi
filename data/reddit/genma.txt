If they were useless they wouldn't exist. It's business 101. 


I don't need to show you, their existence is proof enough. It's a good thing to do for anyone who doesn't mind paying 10% over spot to get BTC from an ATM. It really isn't that hard to figure out. People are paying for a service, if it doesn't suit their needs they don't use it. If it does they do. If what you say is true and no one uses them then they will be forced to lower prices.


Yes it still applies because it is the reason they have set margins high in the first place, else they would have no choice but to lower them.
ATM companies have zero moral obligation to anyone. They are there to make money, and they are going to work out how to make the most money from their ATMs.

Scarce just means there is a limited supply. It is not created in abundance. Dividing something up isn't creating more of that resource. Something can be scarce and infinitely divisible. If I'm selling a hat for 2 BTC, it doesn't matter if you have 1BTC or 1 billion, billionths of a bitcoin (equaling 1 BTC), you still can't afford the hat. By chopping it up the bitcoin is no less scarce.

There the thing, there aren't real alternatives. Real alternatives would equal lower fees. The demographic that uses an ATM is not the same demographic that signs up to cryptsy or sends a passport scan to a foreign exchange or gets BTC from mining. An ATM is the most 'legacy' and probably the easiest method (conceptually) of getting BTC, which is why fees will stay high until equally accesable vectors are available.

Sepa transfers are £4 ($6) with my bank so I'd rather pay it and minimize risk. And the reason isn't to do with transfer risk, its minimizing your exposure. You exchange and withdraw the BTC before you deposit the next installment meaning you have less money on a site at any given time.

The problem is with decentralized community, the longer the community waits the harder it is to gain any kind of consensus as the user base grows and splinters into wider spread, more diverse communities. There will be a time in the future where basically nothing that is community based (like the bits discussion) can be agreed on because there will be no central communication hubs. Even if bitcoin isn't really ready yet, it's important that the future proofing happens as soon as possible, to avoid reaching a point in time where it becomes unfeasible.

The first people in the system didn't earn money by doing nothing. They were crucial for the network to survive. The structuring of the network, liquidity, information dissemination, network integrity (nodes + miners) were all established by the first in. 
The first people into a system will get the most rewards because its how capitalism works. You are basically annoyed at angel investors. The greater the risk involved the greater potential rewards required to make it a worth while investment. And the chance of Bitcoin failing in 2010 where much higher than today, hence the price differential. Just market dynamics, literally nothing to do with a structured hierarchy like MLM.




MLMs do have these traits, but they are not what defines an MLM. This is all just capitalism. The more users a network has the greater its value. Of course bitcoin holders want people to use bitcoin, because every new user adds utility to the network which adds value, the same as any other network. Some holders will definitely evangelize, but the actions of users does not define in anyway if something is an MLM.
You are trying to piece together an answer from circumstantial evidence, when the answer is already in plain sight.
@_date: 2014-09-28 22:50:58


I addressed this in my first post, it has none of the characteristics of an MLM other than the fervor of a section of its userbase. An MLM requires: obfuscation, gradation between levels, and a requirement of constant expansion to survive. A "decentralized MLM" isn't an MLM. The ML stands for Multi-level. The multi-levels are a requirement because they are the mechanism that allows higher level actors to exploit the lower level actors for profit. A "decentralized MLM" would be a single level marketing company, which is just a company derived of shareholders. Everyone's earnings are then proportional to their holdings in the company, which means it isn't reliant on a constant influx of people into the base of the hierarchy to maintain a revenue, so would actually be able to operate as a legitimate company.

The properties of the asset bitcoin give it a lot of utility to some people and very little to others, but that isn't what is going to underpin the value of bitcoin anyway.

This is a relatively recent trend though.

@_date: 2014-10-27 16:02:57
I imagine that its the difference in security requirements. An ATM that is filled and emptied manually is essentially a cold wallet. A machine that replenishes itself from an exchange needs access to an exchange account which opens up security issues.
Also a machine can't buy more bitcoin on demand unless you give it permission to buy with fiat that's already on an exchange, so you would have to leave a sizable float (in BTC or fiat) to cover all of your machines on a third party exchange, something people are advised not to do.

MLM - A central actor encourages a number of other actors to invest in something in return for something of little to no real world value in a fixed hierarchy on a promise of a) high profit margins on a cheap product and b) getting more new actors into the hierarchy directly underneath you feeding your personal revenue stream (and by design, those directly above you). This structure allows large profits to flow up the streams towards the tip of the hierarchy. An MLM by design is centralized and non-transparent in nature. People lower down are often not allowed to know exactly how far down they are in the pyramid, only seeing those they directly interact with.

Bitcoin - Every bitcoin is worth the same so every actor benefits proportionally with the growth of the network. Note that with a MLM the goods you purchase either have little utility like a poor quality 'how to' guide or a good whose market value is vastly lower than what you just paid to purchase it ($600 for 24 energy drinks). With bitcoin wealth is being traded 1:1. If you buy a bitcoin at a market price of $600, that is what it is worth at that moment and neither party can be said to have 'lost any wealth'. There is nothing stopping you from turning around and selling it right back to the market for market price, just like gold or an antique vase. Bitcoin has a flat hierarchy with no central authority and is transparent.

While you are right, what is important is the impression the recipient of the tip gets from the tip, not the intentions of the tipper. The idea that the tip is just meant as a small token of appreciation only works in the context understood by users already familiar with the 'culture' of crypto micro payments/tips. To someone completely out of the loop on crypto currency a tip may not even be understood, let alone appreciated. Add to that that the tip may be too small to realistically do anything with and you can see how people may take insult to small tips.
In r/bitcoin I think a 100 bit tip acts exactly as you state, as a gesture of thanks, and is likely to be taken that way by the recipient, but in non-crypto subs I'm not so sure.

In an ideal world it may be better to deal with this in a few years, but in reallity that may not be an option to us, it may be beyond the reach of any individual to get enough support behind an idea to carry it to a non negligible number of users on the larger future network.

One advantage to the word bits is it is synonymous with both bitcoin and to the internet. When someone receives 2000 bits via changetip, even a noob knows that they have just received bitcoins.

People think because bits is already used in internet nomenclature it shouldn't be used in bitcoin, but this is the exact reason it should be used. Bitcoin has no physical properties which makes the "Bitcoin" branding so important. There is nothing better to name *the currency of the internet* after than something laymen already associate with techy stuff and the internet. When people think sending bits, they will think sending bitcoin.

Past performance is not always an indication of future performance, but equally that doesn't mean it is therefore never an indicator. The point is that you can't just look at a graph and say 'this trend will continue' without knowing what is causing the trend. You can however look at underlying properties that may be causing a trend, finding correlation between determinate factors and using them it to project forward and make predictions i.e [Moore's law]( 
This is completely different from 'we can't be sure where future price will be so everything must be random'. Disregarding the past cyclical movements that have occurred with bitcoin 3/4/5 times is far worse than deciding 'this is the special crash because I just think it is' with fingers in ears. All evidence points to this being the same old bitcoin price cycle. Any contrary claim requires some evidence.

I'm one of the proponents of a larger blocksize, and it's got nothing to do with any one elses opinion in the community. I came to it of my own volition just by thinking through the economics of the ecosystem and how the crypto economy works. In a vacuum Blockstreams plans make sense, create a fee market now to ensure decentralization by funding miners more through transactions. The problem is Bitcoin is not in a vacuum, it exists with 1000+ other cryptos and alts. Trying to force people to pay more in a system which is a) opt-in and b) has such low friction (inter-crypto transfer) is doomed to fail. People aren't going to pay more to transfer bitcoin over any other available crypto that shares the same utility function. 
Cores plan to keeps bitcoin viable by raising prices (effectively restricting user number), in the long term actually makes bitcoin non viable vs alternative cryptos. The only reason bitcoin as a settlement layer exists as a proposal is because users have given it that value (utility for payment) via network effects. Without these network effects Bitcoin is just "crypto  and can be replaced easily by crypto  As users leave the value proposition falls and bitcoin acts neither a currency nor a settlement layer. This is why alts are rising as btc is falling, it's not an attack on bitcoin by shadowy forces, it's financially invested actors acting rationally. That's why censorship, and targetted tweets etc will not stem it, because its a natural result of market efficiency in a low friction environment. You can't censor people from rational self interest.
@_date: 2016-01-17 02:06:47


Wouldn't happen because bitcoin holders (the economic majority) are economically aligned against that change (diluting/devaluing their own holdings). That's why it is essentially set in stone, unlike the block size.

None. But what is ideologically best isn't really relevant. What is relevant is the reality. The "democracy of the economic majority" is the framework that bitcoin is built around. That's just how it functions.
Saying "We are the devs, we know best, you don't understand the technicalities" is failing to understand that part of the responsibilities of core dev "leadership" is being connected enough with the community that the work you are putting in isn't just given a "no" by the ecosystem.

The 21 million BTC limit isn't some mythical Bitcoin decree. It is held in place by economic incentives, nothing else.
If the economic majority (the stakeholders) wanted a 50m limit, then the new limit would be 50m, and bitcoin would have 50m because it would have the most backing and the longest valid chain. And 'validity' isn't determined by this bitcoin decree either. Validity is the consensus rules that this same majority chose to abide by by running and using this particular version of bitcoin. If it was all based on what a handful of people think it should be, it would have failed a long time ago.
The longest valid chain *is* bitcoin. And what is defined as valid is based on democratic/economic activity.

It may be a good thing or it may be a bad thing, but ultimately it's not really relevant whether it should or should not happen, it is already a natural feature of the technology. The devs *should* have been aware of this, but i'm not sure that their actions show that to be true.
@_date: 2016-01-16 13:43:29
Correct, but they are only going to control it in a way that is in their favor (ie not devaluing their source of income and/or getting themselves forked from the network).
@_date: 2016-01-18 16:24:06


This is a fundamental misunderstanding. Bitcoin is a currency based on the rules set in place by a 50%+1 miner majority which is in turn at the whim of the economic majority. Laying a "100% dev consensus" layer over the top of that doesn't change the economics of the system. This is why this debate has gotten this far, the "concensus" of the devs is irrelevant against 50%+1 of miners and the economic majority.
@_date: 2016-01-18 16:54:02


Thinking that an alt client being released affects the price is naive. 
Markets react to uncertainty, not support of features. Any fork, even an amazing upgrade would bring the price down momentarily.
"Fork clients" only affect the price if it starts gaining enough support to produce a possibility of a fork occurring and uncertainty in the market, which if that is the case, contradicts your point about universal support for core. There clearly isn't universal support for core or the market would remain unaffected.
The market is actually telling us that there is significant support for classic, which is creating uncertainty, and tanking the price.

The 21 million limit is held in place by economic incentives. Nothing to do with agreement/non agreement. It will remain because no one would rationally destroy/dilute their own holdings, and so no one would agree to raise the limit. Completely different from blocksize because economic incentives is where the pressure to rise the block size is coming from.

If what you say was true, the price would have been slowly falling as more and more people became aware and convinced of the arguments for a contentious hard fork like XT.
This is all just how you perceive the movements of the market. I'm telling you the fundamentals of how markets work. Uncertainty -&gt; less demand -&gt; price down. Which is exactly what has been happening.
The market tells you about the ecosystem, not the other way around.
@_date: 2016-01-18 17:16:18
The global economic majority are not what determines the economic majority concensus of bitcoin, which is determined by bitcoin holders and traders. There can, and will, be outside influence, but to change the 21m limit you need to convince the majority of the ecosystem (holders) to devalue their own holdings which would be infeasible. That is why the 21m limit is seen as 'set in stone'.
@_date: 2016-01-14 03:16:02


It couldn't happen because 'the mob' in bitcoin are the economic stakeholders and no stakeholders are going to dilute their own holdings.
That's why bitcoin works, because it just relies on people to act in their own economic interest.
@_date: 2016-01-17 04:09:35
Not at all. Short term economic interests are in favor of a larger block size, but more importantly an expansive outlook. That's what got money to pour into bitcoin in the first place. A sudden change of tack (from global cash to settlement layer) was never going to go down well with the economic majority. Whether it is right in the long term will be seen but if the fork happens it is purely because the market wants it.
@_date: 2016-01-18 16:36:44
Then you will understand that we are in this position because the core devs are working against the functionality of the platform. They attempted to ignore the economic majority in a system that demands what the economic majority desires.

Micro- and milli- are always referring back to the base unit of 1 bitcoin which, if no one can afford, is a bad spot to be in.
Also to be practical, people need to be 100% confident with quantities in transactions, even when done quickly. 10 microbitcoin and 10 millibitcoin are phonetically and visually (10mBTC / 10uBTC) very similar, opposed to 10,000 bits / 10 bits.

Anyone got any good links for explaining bitcoin safe keeping to complete noobs? The actual methodology and reasoning behind it, cold storage etc? Edit: This isn't for me, I want links to give to others.

They're not mutually exclusive. In fact they are dependent on each other. You should want everyone with bitcoin to be trying to maximize the value of their holdings, because it can only be done long term by strengthening the network, increasing usability, increasing demand. That's why bitcoin works, the incentives are aligned.

That wasn't the fee that was the total output. Your fee was 0.00005431 BTC. (54 bits, not 354 bits)

I think Xapo is global, and maybe Coinapult.

Its happening because there is no compromises coming from the 1mb proponents and no alternative ideas other than secondary layers that are no where near implementation. There are bips, but if some core devs veto them, XT is the nuclear option to just fork around them. The block limit is going to be raised because users want a cheap transactional network. All that is left to find out is how we get there.
