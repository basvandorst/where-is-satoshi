I just want to keep around $400 in BTC. I'll have to look into it. I just didn't want to put $400 in coinbase and then not have a wallet to use. What's the easiest to use? Or are they all similar?

Yeah I'm on a budget and just want to try it out the easiest way. I'll look for a wallet for my phone because I'll also be ordering product from it too
