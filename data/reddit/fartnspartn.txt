He literally just pitted them against each other by focusing one "important" (but false) distinction between the two. Can't be clearer than that.

Y'know, I never had a particular preference for either sub in general, especially with this incessant shit-show that has been happening on both sides, but the reason I have barely ever comment here is for fear of being banned for the offhand comment or misstep, and I think that speaks volumes in and of itself.
  
I looked at one of your direct responses to an inquiry(link above) in the thread you just linked and the first thing thing you say is


And we're suppose to take your word for it? Forgive me if my bullshit alarm immediately starts ringing but I'd rather be presented with the facts(logs) themselves rather than your interpretation(opinion). Of course I have no delusions that this question won't be somehow ignored or immediately sidetracked. I have a simple question for you. Will ever get public mod logs? Yes or No that's all I want. Or don't respond and prove my point.
