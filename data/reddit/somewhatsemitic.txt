You're a paranoid man, Sri. I'm new to ucash. I discovered your scam just 2 days ago.
And I am NOT racist. I just acknowledge reality. We all know that non-Whites are statistically more likely to vote Democrat/liberal/bigger government. After all, they need their welfare cheques.

That's adorable that you think you're ahead. Your ucash pump and dump is over. You made a lot of money at the expense of your soul and credibility. Congratulations!

lol you have no product and you have no code. Your product is the shitcoin and the bounty system. We all know it.

Woah, woah, nobody here is racist. Settle down big guy. We just want to point out to everyone that u.cash is NOT a legitimate company.
Congratulations on your February pump and dump, scammer. You have no product after 6 years so it's clear what you are, Sri.

And you too. Keep it up, Bitcoin Super Scammer.

Hey ageesen, big fan here. Quick question for you. Is there any aspect of your business that is legitimate? Nothing you're saying makes any sense whatsoever. 
How much ucash do you personally own? 
Good day,

Lol your grasp of English is lacking. I am not anti-semitic. I'm Jewish! Let's stop fighting now. I don't care anymore and you're making yourself look silly. Have a nice night, Sri.
Please consider to stop scamming people.

Bitcoin has pumps/dumps and it's obviously legitimate, but ucash doesn't have a product, nor does it have customers. Your website is a social marketing shitcoin distribution scheme. 
You have way more time to spend on Reddit than I'd expect from a CEO. What does it matter what I think of your scam? As long as you're making money on it...
It's cute that you think everyone who hates your scam is Emanuel, but okay.

Wow! Meet-ups!
Dude, Roger Ver has more credibility than you.

Oh wait, 100,000 ucash is only worth $277. I'll pass. If you want, you can send me the bitcoin directly. Let me know and I'll send you the address for my lightning node.

We already went through this, Sri. You can keep pretending that Emanuel's the only person who knows you're a scammer...
Your entire business is as follows:
- make 1 commit to increase ucash supply to 21 billion
- pay strangers to run your social marketing campaign
- coin pumps
You had a good February and now your market cap is well below BITCONNECT.
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DOOOO?

Is it completely out of the realm of possibility for multiple people to attack a scammer? 
Okay, bye. I suggest you stay out of Toronto, because rent is incredibly high and your scam will fail in the next couple years.
@_date: 2018-04-17 00:29:37
You might be right. Hey, can you give me 100,000 ucash bounty for growing your brand? 
@_date: 2018-04-16 23:32:41
You are a filthy anti-semite. Reported.
