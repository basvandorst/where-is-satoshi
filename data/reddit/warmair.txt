Stupidly, only windows defender and AVG FREE

thanks, I'll give it a shot :)

I laughed.. Then hated you a little :D

Point 2) is something I'd never thought of. Just because my $1000 USD are worth $1,000,000 tanzanian shillings doesn't mean I can walk around throwing money at people and calling myself a millionaire... 
I will from now on refer to the bitcoin-wealthy as bit-barons

No fucking idea, For all I know a crack team of ninjas stole my laptop whilst I was eating last night and passed out the coins to their waiting compatriots. Also, yep, I'm Simon, nice to meet you.

True, I'm feeling disheartened, so pardon my hyperbole. Surely you can understand the sentiment I am trying to direct at you? Whilst Multibit is certainly not to blame, the bitcoin architecture does leave itself open to this kind of event being possible, not something which is possible with other currencies.

I feel so disheartened, I bought a few BTC a while back in the hopes that they'll appreciate in value and I'd be able to buy some takeaway and gifts around this time of year, I boot up multibit to find that all my cash is gone.. If I even knew how the thief got in I'd be happy now I just feel pretty stunned.. And really put off ever using bitcoin, I'll stick to fiat I think, Paypal has never stolen £600/ $1,000 USD from me.
**Edit:** looks like I'm not the only one

For the mathematically/graphically challenged. has plotted the amount of bitcoins you can buy with $ 1,000,000 USD against time. He has also shown the formula of the line (y= 1E+107e^-0.006x ) you can use this to calculate things, but it's not that intresting.
The intresting bit is that pimms shows the R² value. This is an interesting tool, it sits between 0 and 1 and tells you how closely the data points you plotted fit with the "Line of best fit" 0 is completely off the line and 1 is completely on it! A value as shown here of 0.84 is a reasonable fit, but not perfect (good correlation is &gt;0.95). 
All Pimms has really shown though is that** so far** XBT has increased in value approximately linearly. Do not expect this to continue forever. Almost any graph like this will see a curve appear if you go further along in time. 
$ 1,000,000 for 1 XBT in 2015? Probably not. When will the curve appear? 06/10/14, of course!

I've sucessfully used [bitbargain]( to buy XBT. Not had any problems with it although it does just work as a middleman between you and a seller. You will need a way of transferring money directly to do it though.
