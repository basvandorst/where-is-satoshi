Thanks for the reply.  I am aware of this and must say that I misspoke before.

This is the equivalent of damming up the river to cause a drought then selling bottled water back to the affected people.
You are right from an individual's point of view but from their pov they are taking advantage of mob mentality to subsidize their loss from their negligence pertaining to security on their platform. 
This is completely illegal and immoral.

I see, going by my continued experience with the last failure of an exchange to secure its bitcoin, at this time we shouldn't expect to be able to withdraw any time in the near future. Nor expect any major revelations as far as providing adequate security in the current environment.
I will say even though this horrible event for bitcoin that most likely set it back another year or so I admire your attempts to put an acceptable public face on yet another bitcoin organization that failed its clients and a community that is desperately looking for an alternative to the rampant corruption in the legacy financial world.

Excellent reply, and at lightning speed! Judging by the competence of your reply, I have a feeling I've responded to someone close to the "colored coins" market.  This should be more visible.
With this model all these factors run independent of the value of Bitcoin.  I can't see any way that there could be enough side chains or colored coins to create any scarcity of Bitcoins.  Even if Nasdaq switched on bitcoin for asset exchange could that ever be enough volume to affect the price?  (Correct me if Im wrong but I'm thinking of a model where trillions of tokens are attached to a single satoshi, or would it be that a single share would be the equivalent of a single satoshi?  In that case there might be a situation where the volume could cause scarcity.)
I guess just by using the blockchain, and the more important it becomes, the more incentive there will be to propagate the network besides just the value of Bitcoins and that in turn will give them more value.  Then eventually the economy will have to mine just to keep it going regardless of value of the value of a bitcoin, which could spiral out of control in that case.  
I've never put much thought into the effects of blockchain use besides bitcoin as a currency.  I thought I had a pretty good grasp on the concept.  Now I have more questions than answers.  Do you know of any sources that go further into this?
@_date: 2015-06-11 01:27:04
Im assuming you would make the leap that the private chain would only stay private until they can end the Bitcoin block chain.  This would be done by taking advantage of the decrease in miners after the halving and launching a 51% attack.  
Hold down price until next year. (Again at a 3 billion market cap its pennies to most institutions).  In the mean time develop and distribute your coin to trusted entities as quickly as possible. (Modifying the Bitcoin source code would probably take less than a week).  All partnered entities allocate computing power to strengthen the network. (This could even involve certain tech companies integrating mining chips into all electronics to be put on the market).  Halving occurs, miners dropout because of the price being held down. (Given the current state of the core development crew I don't think it would take much more than this to send Bitcoin into a rapid downward spiral.)  Begin to mine your own Bitcoin chain to complete 51% attack. (Coming up with that amount of hashing power would be the only real hurdle at this point).  In a matter of days if not hours Bitcoin would be dead if that happened.   Release (Sell) your secure coin and open up the source code so it can be deemed decentralized. (And at that point if its decentralized it just makes you more legitimate). You and your ruling elite stay there because you of course have reserved the largest chunk of the new coin for yourself. (Not to mention any other goodies that you have packed into the protocol that you can take advantage of).

Well, you hear about the tax havens but you don't hear about the laundering.  If you did know where the laundering was happening it wouldn't be happening anymore, if you get my drift.

This is the most important question that has to do with the price of Bitcoin in the next few years.  Anyone can now create their own currency that could be worth trillions of dollars and it would all exist in one satoshi. 
I still haven't wrapped my head around how this would effect currency as a whole. If Apple just switched all their shares to tokens in one satoshi. Their shares could be used as currency as easily as Bitcoin or the dollar. Then what is it valued against? The dollar?  Who needs it or any fiat currency, at least any more than any other currency?   Does all currency become pegged to Bitcoin then?  How does Bitcoin measure value then?  Is it against the cost of mining?  Does the value of Bitcoin distill down to speed and efficiency of chips coupled with cost of energy production?  
The tweet today by seems to be the biggest question as to where bitcoins value is heading.

The article is misleading in suggesting Bitcoin isn't fundamentally the same as "the blockchain". It suggests it's more a relationship where Bitcoin came about because of the blockchain. 
However the approach Wall St is taking has nothing to do with Bitcoin as a currency, as laid out in range premise of the article.  That doesn't necessarily mean it won't take off as a currency. It could very well never be used as a viable form of currency, just a token to keep the cost of mining viable.

If WWIII were to break out I doubt things would end up all Mad Max.  Everyone has figured out that the use of nuclear weapons is a zero sum game so that won't happen (on a large scale anyway).  Physically, just like the last world wars the fragile populations in the developed countries will be affected the most. Undeveloped countries will barely notice besides armor driving through and planes flying overhead.  The established populations could continue on with little fear of seeing bombs or bullets.  Full scale invasion would most likely happen at Ground Zero (most likely the Middle East north to Ukraine.)
The worst part of the war will be fought electronically.  Governments will "hack" each others systems to cause financial ruin.  Grids will go down, markets will loose all information, treatment plants will go offline.  Any server that can be pinpointed will be vulnerable.  Most of all credit will stop causing most to fend for themselves.  How this affects Bitcoin is that it runs on servers.  I would think in the early stages of full scale mobilization people will flock to it but if the war drags on into most systems being taken off line it would probably become pretty useless.  If things got to that point though currency would be the least of your problems.  Most likely we would be forced to live under a feudal system where each ruler that can protect his population would seek to get back online and communicate with the rest of the world.  In that case the original blockchain would most likely be lost and a new one would be started.
But Im just guessing.

You know what the problem with fiat is?  It's controlled by people.  Where there is control there will be manipulation.  
By using your method your trading one means of manipulation for the other (I speculate you already hold some coins so you are ok with this). The layers built on top of bitcoin will be end up being in controlled by a minority.  
The financial world was given a gift in its darkest time with bitcoin. However the bitcoin itself isn't the greatest gift.  The greatest gift was Satoshi giving up the the reins and allowing bitcoin to be guided purely by the consensus of the market.  That is what Classic is trying to regain from Core. 
Core can continue down their current path but in the end, the cat is out of the bag.  Much the same as radical fundamentalism, once the idea is realized it cannot be forgotten, only mitigated.  If bitcoin becomes digital gold a new coin will usurp it and do what Satoshi designed bitcoin to do.

Governing bodies won't be as friendly as they have been to Bitcoin if the anti-privacy issues aren't there to balance the equation. For a crypto to exist it will have to be visible to the public and by default the governing bodies. Most citizens will willfully adhere to the "I have nothing to hide" doctrine so they will declare and pay their tax.

That is exactly how the Fed and fiat works and the reason bitcoin was invented.  BTW the Fed is doing a great job with man made economics and their debt based economy spiraling into inevitable default.


I'll take that as a compliment.  I was kind of proud of that line myself.


Yea, I use it to eat stuff. Please, enlighten me.

I replied to a short vague post with a short vague post myself.  My point is that this will not do enough to to get a business owners interest if they are a successful and busy entrepreneur. 
Obviously the part that really matters is the customer trading their currency for your product.  To get a busy entrepreneur's (that is hopefully swamped with business) attention you need a more drastic approach. You have to make them take time out of their day to improve what is currently working.

The Grexit thing will go to the 11th hour. It will because it's a negotiation and that is how negotiations work. Just because there will be a bunch of hype leading up to the last chance doesn't mean either of the sides are seriously entertaining the idea of a Euro collapse.  Exactly the same situation as the USG shutdown negotiations.  Don't believe the hype. 
If a financial apocalypse is to happen it will come from the private sector and the beneficiaries will be long removed from the situation before the politicians know what hit them.  Governments will be left to clean up the mess. Then we will find out if politicians truly represent their people or if they will bow to their thieving financiers.  That is when it will get really interesting or should I say dangerous.

The thought is that **people** will inevitably set up Bitcoin storage sites that will insure deposits against thieves so if they loose the coins the customer will get reimbursed.  Just like banks' inception before banks' business became making money off money more than customers security.
@_date: 2015-04-21 19:43:04
Yes I get that.  I don't see what your explaining as an issue. It's basically the same as the system we have now. 
Ask yourself why would the economy get to the point of needing to add more decimal places?  In the current economy we can print more money to balance inflation. With Bitcoin you can't make more but you can divide it more.  That means the value of the currency stays the same just more divisible.  Then it must be the goods that are changing value. 
A banana is 1 satoshi and two apples are one satoshi.  The more decimals are added so the banana is 100 satoshis and an apple is 50 satoshis. 
It would mean wages would get to the point where 1btc is an acceptable yearly salary.  Then .1 is a yearly salary .01 and so on.  I guess I'm saying that if we get to the point where we need to add more decimal points to BTC we will be buying and selling things that are an equivalent cost of Star Destroyers and The Death Star.  
Edit:  This is why I get irked.  People make the suggestion that there is only so much Bitcoin to go around. This leads people to be live that at some point we will have to pay for the mistake of adopting a currency that has a hard limit.  It's just not true.  If we get to the point where the global/solar systems wealth is larger than 21m BTC and that amount isn't functional for the economy we can divide it infinitely and keep going.

That is what im saying-  A satoshi would be too much for the cheapest thing, a pack of gum, an apple, whatever.  An apple is worth .5 satoshi but you cannot divide a satoshi so decimals are added.  An apple becomes 5 satoshi and a banana becomes 10.  Similar but the inverse of something like this:   
Maybe I misspoke when I used the term value attached to bananas and apples. Adding decimals would solely be a functionality case.  The value stays the same its the currency that changes, the same way as with inflation. A banana was worth $1 and an apple $.5.  The amount of money created goes up by 10x due to printing.  A banana is now worth $10 and an apple $5. Person X did get paid 100,000 satoshi a year now they get 1,000,000 an year.  Instead of having an infinite amount of money to create, the finite amount of money can be divided infinitely and 21 million is completely arbitrary.  The system works the same as now just inverted.  
My point is that skeptical media spreads misinformation that the 21 million eludes to at some point we get stuck with only a certain amount of units to transact with.  
@_date: 2015-04-11 18:23:17
Im speaking more to the fact that there will always be a cat and mouse game on the internet with hacker thieves and website managers.  We all want Bitcoin to be completely decentralized and autonomous from humans when it comes to security but if coins are left out in the wild on the internet and they get stolen through internet protocols there is no recourse.  That means as the internet exists today there has to be some level of human backing and thus "banks".

The only thing that irks me is when people suggest there is a finite supply.  Yes there are only 21 million BTC that can be mined.  However they can be divided down 8 decimal places. That makes 2.1 quadrillion units.  This is well beyond the current wealth of the world and its wealth for the practical future. 
Beyond that there is a possibility more decimal places can be added to the code  in the future however unlikely that will be. 
@_date: 2015-04-12 00:16:26
Thank you for the informative answer.  I can live with all points except 5.  I guess my concern is that there are or can be back doors in every piece of electronics, whether government or corporate.  Given that these back doors and programs to exploit them exist, how can we ever be sure that any wallet or a transaction is truly secure? Sure the encryption in bitcoin is top notch but what about the actual hardware and software designed to use it?
I trust the absoluteness of Bitcoin but I don't necessarily trust the MacBook it runs on or the wallet software I downloaded off the internet.  Sure its in both these institutions best interest to not allow hacks but that doesn't necessarily mean a nefarious character somewhere between the software developer, internet provider, server handler, chip manufacturer, computing device maker, etc hasn't compromised the integrity of the chain.  And if Bitcoin is to get to where users think it could/should be there will be ample reward to take on the risk of developing a way to hack through that chain somewhere.  
There will be people falling victim to such attacks and what happens then? At the moment there is nothing that exits where someone has recourse for loss of Bitcoin through their fault or others.  The Gox situation is a perfect example of that.  
Writing this reply just made me realize selling the shovels during this gold rush will be Bitcoin insurance and open sourced hardware and software for BTC.  Hopefully the justice system can catch up quickly.

I would like to believe that bitcoin will win out in the end because it is the utopian way for currency to evolve.  However, I also am not 100% naive.  There is  a very real possibility that the legacy institutions will use blockchain tech as the mainstream way to transact and push bitcoin to the fringe.  Although it require much more work, it is completely possible that every institution sets up their own blockchain that requires a person be vetted and given permission to transact on their blockchain.  It could be fully disguised as the institution getting rid of all money, but what it really becomes is a ledger in which every person, in order to be a part of functioning society will be overseen financially and stripped of their privacy.  And if permission needs to be given it can also be taken away.  
so that they could not buy or sell unless they had the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of its name.  Revelation 13:17
pretty creepy.
The utopian possibility I envision is a means where instead of the states requirement to levy tax as a means to fund projects for the good of the people, the state must crowdsource any project and funds given to them by private citizens.  Representatives are then truly working for their citizens.

My latest revelation into what Bitcoin and the blockchain can do:  all medical records can be kept and be kept completely private.  Everyone is talking about how big data is going to revolutionize medical research.  
Imagine you had a private key to a single satoshi.  That satoshi has every detail of your medical history attached to its public key.  Every time you go to the doctor you give access to the satoshi and when you are done you lock it back up. Researchers could access the data but never know who exactly it came from.

This is true. The wealthy will get on board just in time to maintain most of their lifestyle if it comes down to it.  
The people who will be hurt the most are once again the middle class. The ones who are late to the party. They will be stuck holding the bag and be allowed to slip into poverty. 
And as usual the lower class will stay the lower class.  Maybe a lucky few will adopt early and be fortunate enough to lift themselves into the upper middle and get their children a good education. 
The real winners will be the upper middle class that is well educated and ahead of the curve. They have the privilege of becoming "young money".

I don't see why the banks are so opposed to bitcoin.  In my estimation the finality of bitcoin will be too much for "common folk" to handle.  With this in mind my belief is that there will still be banks.  People will just have a 'bank' hold their coins and then they will transact through those means.  Bitcoin wont destroy banks it will just force them to pivot and respect their clients a little more.  
The big changes are going to come for the IRS and the Federal Reserve.  Also there will be a new black market involving coins that are not in the banks which will not necessarily be illegal but rouge coins.

Its sad really.  This is a chance for banks to get back to what they originally were intended to do, security.  On top of that, I'm sure the opportunity will arise for the new security institutions to build products on their ability to hold large amounts of bitcoin at one time.  Initially I'm thinking that when computing runs on IOT the ability to do large amounts of transactions at one time will be very powerful.

Bitcoin needs a hedging market in order to for any business to cover the volatility. Unless this happens bitcoin will struggle to be widely accepted.
Example: If I were to buy a used car for B100 (a perfect market for bitcoin) in April, the the fiat value I might have paid would've been anywhere from $20k to $1,100.
As long as btc is tied to usd this will be the hurdle that needs to be overcome.
