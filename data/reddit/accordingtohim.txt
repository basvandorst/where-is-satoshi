You hit the nail on the head with the exchange value comments.  I've modeled the reward to miners over time under a wide range of assumptions, and in the majority of them the incentive to mine (measured in USD) reaches a minimum between the years 2030 and 2040.

Modern cryptography *is* pure math.  That's exactly the *point* of modern cryptography.  Provable cryptography rests on mathematical proofs (that's the 'provable' part).
Security is defined rigorously in mathematical terms, and a cryptographic protocol is demonstrated to be secure using mathematical proof -- in particular, by demonstrating that the problem of breaking the protocol can be reduced to an instance of a problem that is known to be hard (where 'hard' is a technical term defined in the language of complexity theory).

I'm so confused.  I'm a mathematician... Meaning I basically prove things for a living.  If I can turn that into making bitcoin I'd be very happy.
Most of the problems listed have trivial proofs.
In the "recent answers" section I see many of the same problems that I see in the "list of problems" section.  Does that mean you don't take problems off the "list of problems" after they've been solved?
Whatever, I'll just cut to the chase... If you want me to do your upper division math homework for bitcoins just PM me.  I'll gladly do that shit for btc.

Why not start from scratch?... Do a well documented, clear implementation of the protocol from a clean start?  Cut it's teeth on the test net until it's good to go.
If it has the same functionality in a clearer, more concise, better documented package, I don't see why it couldn't become the "standard".
After all, it's the protocol that matters.  Not a particular instantiation of it.
@_date: 2014-03-25 20:03:40


Yes.  But it's a completely different protocol.  Much more powerful and efficient (the zerocash/zerocoin guys picked up some cool new ideas from some Microsoft researchers).
My favorite feature of zerocash:  Alice can money to Bob, and only Alice and Bob will know how much was sent.  Not even the miners can know how much was sent.  That's just so badass to me.

Yep.  I came here to say this too.
@_date: 2014-03-15 20:53:12
Yes, this is a thing.  But proof of burn is not the same thing as proving that you've intentionally lost or forgotten a private key that you once had access to.  The former is just sending coins to an address from which it is impossible to spend.  The latter is not possible under any classical model of computation.
@_date: 2014-02-26 20:14:49
Good choice.
@_date: 2014-01-03 07:56:45
That's smart.
@_date: 2014-03-25 06:35:13
It's the voluntary-ness that's at the root of the problem (at least in their model).  The incentives drive individual users to spend as little as possible on fees while still getting the transaction in a block.
The transaction fee problem is actually a very serious one... By far the most serious concern on the list.  It will rear its head long before 2140.  My own projections (I'm a mathematician will more than 3 years of formal training in the mathematical theory of games) suggest that the problem will be most severe between 2030 and 2040... Assuming it's not addressed long before then.
There are a handful of possible solutions, but none are palatable to everyone. 
I agree that the other attacks can be addressed in a rather straightforward way.

@_date: 2014-02-24 02:48:09
The solution nobody wants to hear:  Keep the block reward constant indefinitely.
Pro: No more transaction fee problem.  Ever.
Con: There would be no upper limit on the total number of coins that will ever exists.
Why Con Doesn't matter: With a constant block reward the annual rate of inflation limits to zero (quickly), so the affect of inflation on the value of the currency becomes negligible.
.... Begin anti-inflation flaming.... now!

@_date: 2014-01-06 06:31:05
Yeah, this is the tricky part, and where devs can get creative.  To keep overhead low. Publishing updates and signing them is easy enough.  Keeping track of which updates are the most recent updates is a little trickier.  p2p time stamping of updates is possible now, thanks to Satoshi.
Ie: if I make an update, I can just add the hash of the most current confirmed block in the bitcoin blockchain (say, whatever block is 6 blocks deep at the time of my update), and then sign the update.  (Thanks for the distributed p2p trustless timestamp server Satoshi!  Turns out we can use it to avoid censorship too!)
@_date: 2014-01-08 07:04:00
Depends on your background.  I have a graduate degree in math, so it was a breeze for me (but incredibly interesting).  I have a friend with a BS in electrical engineering and he followed it with no problem.

What MarcusOrlyius said.  Also, dropping this on top of tor might not be a good idea (bit torrent over Tor is very dangerous, can give attackers tons of leverage when trying to deanonomize you).  I2P is better designed for torrents.
That said, there will be a strong desire to make this compatible with the deep web.  That would change everything.  Silkroad3.p2p.i2p   Oh yeah.  That's gonna be the shit.

I trust them too.  But I still don't think one should hold much money there.  It has nothing to do with them being registered/legal/above-board or not.  I just don't trust any third party wih too much money *period*.
I trust btc-e as much as I trust coinbase -- enough to use them, but not enough to keep any coins there.
Sure, theoretically I could sue coinbase if they run off with my coins... But in actual practice I'm a poverty-class citizen that couldn't afford the lawyer I'd need to do so.  So I could really care less if an exchange is registered/legal/above-board.  It's all about reputation.
... Reputation, and not letting other people hold your coins for you.
@_date: 2014-03-31 03:58:10
I'll try to be nicer than the others.  A key problem with your proposal is the statement "... A small number of blocks would need to be checked to see if the coins were spent."  In actual fact, *every* block in *every* blockchain would need to be checked to make sure the coins hadn't already been spent.
A key to decentralized cryptocurrencies  (at least without ZKPs) is that "everybody sees every transaction".  In practice, that means everybody sees, and checks, every block.  So using multiple chains won't help reduce the amount of work people need to do... Everyone still needs to see everything.
@_date: 2014-01-04 00:24:12
I think that's exactly the point.  People who think bitcoin isn't worth anything because "anybody can just create another altcoin" will play with this.  When the realize everything you just mentioned, they'll see that the value of bitcoin is based on the network effect.... The ecosystem and infrastructure built around bitcoin.  That's what makes bitcoin so much better than all the altcoins: people actually care about, use, develop, and build around bitcoin far, far more than any other currency.
It's a neat project.
@_date: 2014-04-01 00:34:30
We agree on that.  Were we disagree is on whether the bitcoin protocol is a trustless system, or a distributed trust system.  I think the former.
The only thing a user of the bitcoin protocol must trust, is that (a) he is connected to at least one honest peer (though he doesn't need to have a way to distinguish which peers are honest and which are not)  and (b) that the total hashing power of any attacker (or group of colluding attackers) is not more than 50% of the total hashing power of the network.
I suppose (a) could be construed to be "distributed trust" in some sense, however, all one is assuming there is that they are receiving all the newly broadcasted blocks.
I suppose we're just mincing words at this point. 
@_date: 2014-03-13 04:49:21
No, what we prove is that breaking ECC is at least as hard (in the complexity theory sense) as solving the discrete log problem.
If one could "break" ECC then one could also, for example, solve the discrete log problem in polynomial time.
Thus, the hardness of the discrete log problem is what provides assurance against someone breaking ECC.

The "Gov't backed fiat has value because governments can force people to accept it as payment" argument irks me every time.  Then I thought of something that would make a cool commercial:

That's exactly what hashcash was designed to do.  It's specifically an anti-DoS and anti-spam measure.
skilliard4 might be right, though... hashcash - used with parameters that would allow for mobile use - might not be enough to reduce the number of transactions a botnet can perform to less than 7 transactions per second.
I'm just not sure.

I've taken this, and it's pretty good for an undergrad course.
@_date: 2014-03-13 05:01:04
That being said, it is currently *unknown* whether the discrete log problem can be solved in polynomial time.  So, with the ECC example at least, I concede.  (My intellectual integrity trumps my ego as a mathematician... Barely.).
But take solace in the fact that the greatest minds in the world have worked on the discrete log problem and none have ever solved it in polynomial time (and most believe it can't be done).  Thus, to break ECC would require (1) that it is in fact *possible* to solve the discrete log problem in polynomial time AND (2) an attacker would have to be smart enough to figure it out (and thus be smarter than some of the greatest minds of the last several decades).

Think of each website as a file.  When you "browse to" a .p2p website you'll download the entire site (anywhere from a few KB to a few GB depending on the website).  You explore the content locally, on your own machine, while at the same time seeding the site to other people.
So you only download and seed the sites you "visit".  Just like with BitTorrent -- not every user downloads and keeps a copy of every torrent in existence.  Only the ones they are interested in.
This kind of thing exists already as Freenet, but Freenet isn't great for dynamic we pages (like, say, a web page that adds and removes torrent files... Or website that acts as an online marketplace).

It's interesting how many "1BASE.."  addresses are in there.

"Tax" was a terrible choice of words on their part.  "Fixed transaction fee" would have been more accurate.  Some combination of flat fee per transaction (which could hinder many micro-transaction applications) and/or fixed percentage fee for each transaction (which could hinder many small-margin-of-profit applications) would solve the problem.
The latter would (in my opinion) be the safest.

@_date: 2013-12-27 19:04:08
Also be careful using coinbase with blockchain.info's SharedSend.  The SharedSend address only forwards to your destination address for 8 hrs.  If the time you send coins from coinbase to SharedSend happens to be one of those times coinbase decides to not broadcast the transaction for a half a day, then when the coins are finally sent the SharedSend address won't be connected to your desired receiving address.  The result is that your coins will be sent into oblivion.

@_date: 2013-12-31 07:13:14
This is brilliant.  Seriously.  I've seen a lot of ideas kicked around, but this is seriously a great one.
I'd love a FAQ, but I'm piecing together how it should work on my own.  The gateways act as a go-between between the client (dumb phone users) and the webwallet 37coins.com.
The webwallet holds the private keys, the gateway relays the data on the users behalf.
When mPesa or the like gets pissed that your cutting into their market, there is no centralized number to blacklist.  They'll black list a gateway here and there, but new ones will pop up (because there is money to be made acting as a gateway), and 37coins.com wins.
But, I have some security concerns:
(1) the gateways can relay whatever messages they want.  If I'm a popular gateway and I think I'm getting too "hot" (attracting attention from mPesa) and will be shut down soon, what's to prevent me from spoofing transactions from all the people who've ever used my gateway and sending their money to an account I control?
(2) the gateways add some decentralization, which minimizes the risk of mPesa being able to shut this down.  But the private keys are all held in one place.... 37coins.com.  So what's to stop you guys from running off with all of Africa's bitcoins?
EDIT: question  has been answered.  But I don't like the answer.  If 37coins communicates directly to the users (sends him a pin), then why have gateways at all?  Why not just have the user communicate the transfer requests directly to 37coins.com on their own?
EDit 2: I found the FAQ (the link is in the footer of the page).  Explains the semi-distributed security.  I like it.  It answers both questions I asked but raises another.
If sending coins requires both signatures (one from the gateway and one from the webwallet) then what happens when a gateway crashes (say, the smartphone gets dropped in a toilet)?  Are the users bitcoins gone forever?

Exactly.  Satoshi's solution to the problem is brilliant.  But most people don't understand the problem to begin with.  Proof of work isn't new.  He didn't invent that.  Proof of work is just one of the pieces he used in creation of the blockchain.
The blockchain is a cryptographic system (or structure) that is built from other cryptographic systems.  Hash functions, proof of work, and digital signatures are the *ingredients*... All of which were around before Satoshi.  Bake together using  Satoshi's *recipe* and you get the blockchain.  And that's one damn good cake.
@_date: 2013-12-31 05:55:18
With a 51% attack you could censor someone's direct message by not including it... However you can't spoof someone else's identity, as that would require you to sign a message with a private key that you don't have.

The $7-8k fiat charge you can get back easily with just a call to your bank.  It was an unauthorized charge.  Done.  Coinbase will have to eat that loss.
Your original 12 BTC are a different story.  Your only recourse would to be to A) sue Coinbase for them (good luck with that) or B) find whoever stole it (very unlikely) and go take them back using either the law, or rubber hose crypto.
Basically, your 12 btc are gone forever.  I'm sorry bud, that's a shitty deal.  But get cracking on at fiat.  Tell your bank ASAP.  You can get that back, easy.

@_date: 2013-12-28 01:57:37
Non-injective functions and one-way functions aren't the same thing.
In laymen's terms, a one way function is one for which finding *any* element of the preimage of a given image element is difficult.  (The word "difficult" is a technical term here).
So, for example, SHA-256 *seems* to be a one-way function... Because if I give you give you a random 256 bits, it is difficult (in the technical sense of the word) for you to find ANY input to SHA-256 that will output the random numbers I gave you.
We have several candidates for one-way functions that *seem* to be one-way.  But nobody has been able to present a formal proof.
Interesting things:
- the existence of one-way functions would imply that P does not equal NP.
- a great deal of modern provable cryptography rests on the underlying assumption that one-way functions exist.
- f(x)=0 is not one-way because it is trivially easy to find a preimage element for the only element of the image (0).  So a function being non-injective, or "lossy" isn't enough.

Step 1: fix a definition of "backing".
Step 2: re-ask the question.
I think the problem with discussions like these is that we don't settle on the definitions of the words before we use them.  If we don't explicitly define the words first, then ppl tend to change the definitions to support their points all throughout the conversation. I've seen it happen a hundred times.

2) the P vs NP problem has not been solved.
