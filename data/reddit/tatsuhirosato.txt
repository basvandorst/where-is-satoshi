this shit is posted every time there's a price drop - it is completely not necessary. Don't invest more than you can afford to lose.
it's not rocket surgery cunts.

sarcasm is lost on Americans. I know.
when the almighty creator was handing out sarcasm detectors he was broke and couldn't afford to give anymore to the American citizens ;D

it's a plea for reddit gold and karma imaginary internet points. literally every single time the price drops people post the exact same damn message.
how many deaths have resulted because of gold dropping in price on reddit? zero

I bought in 5 more coins this morning, 5 mins later the price dropped by 100 USD
just my fucking luck
@_date: 2016-08-03 04:37:43
exactly right. People are gambling every single thing they own in the hopes of striking it big and then people post rubbish like this saying "please dont kill yourself over this" well dont kill yourself over anything!
so what? you lost all your money, you can make more money. no big fucking deal.
search the subreddit and each price drop has the same old boring templated message about a hotline number to call. It's money, it comes and goes. Big fuckin' deal.


BIG FUCKIN WOOP

they are rated at 99 years however cheap fucking shit wont last more than a few years
buy Verbatim and TDK and you are A-OK.
or Taiyo Yuden
@_date: 2016-08-12 15:09:04
because dumb fuckwits telling people they are wrong when they have no idea what they are talking about should shut their fucking dumb mouths
a 5 second ebay search would of proven himself wrong before he went crapping on about absolute rubbish

no need to try and explain anything to me m8. I had a 1x Kodak writer and Kodak discs. $6 each for blanks definitely isn't correct in 1995 unless you were buying garbage.


As I said, my TDK, Taiyo Yuden and Verbatim (probably Ritek dvdr too) are all perfectly fine. Shit like Princo and other cheap discs barely lasted a few years

updated with a link to his post on his site after he got the million bucks in 4 days. From a 5 dollar drm free sale.
very awesome dude

the music industry killed itself.
Movie industry is doing the exact same thing.
using outdated business models from 30 years ago and demanding to receive the same amount of profits year over year is amazing. Suing their own customers into oblivion to financially ruin them for sharing a handful of songs is even better.
too little too late for the music and movie industry, who spend billions of dollars on having laws changed around the world to ensure they keep making huge profits.
fuck them in their stupid asses. the only revolution was people just stopped buying 30 dollar CDs and 25 dollar cassettes.

he always accepts bitcoin, or buy his shit for 5 dollars or whatever, he releases it all DRM free.
he's a good guy
last time his standup he released for 5 bucks made a million bucks, he gave most of it all to his staff as a bonus saying he didnt need that much money


 &lt;-- this is the 12 day follow up where he says hes mostly giving all the money to his staff and charities
here's his AMA on reddit about doing it
