Central planning is never going to help you. Whether txation or monetary policy or regulations or welfare, nothing that these armed men do to run society will ever benefit the humble. It's all plain looting, disguised as help for the ignorant voter. You are unspeakably naive and stupid to think that more policy will save you.
People have to just walk away. That's what bitcoin is for. That's what we're doing here!

OK, good luck with your violence.

You don't have a choice, and it simply does not matter what some liberal college professor taught you in your state sanctioned economics curriculum.
Eventually productive members of society will just reject your rules and stop accepting your bullshit money. 
Oh sure, you can try to coerce us back into participation through violence. You can send your jackbooted thugs after us to collect your legally mandated "share" of our labor. But that only works for so long before we want freedom so badly we will *fucking kill you in self defense*. That's called a revolution, and it's starting.
Bitcoin allows men to simply work, to transact with whomever we please on whatever terms we choose, and to save the product of our labor. Nobody can take it by debasement or by seizing it through taxation. It's over for you, and your hegemony, and your tyranny. Your cherished bankers and legislators, your currency, your rules and regulations... it is all over for you. DIAF, statist.

I still don't understand what you mean by "it balances out". You've just repeated the same assertion without explaining what it means.
What balances against what? What exactly is this desirable outcome that you believe would be attained were it not for "republicans"?

balances out how?

Bwahaha, you think *inflation* does that? It "evens out" the distribution of wealth?
Here's a hint: the rich don't give a flying crap what the price of a sack of rice is, because that is a negligible percentage of their expenses. But rising food/fuel prices will sure as hell wipe out the poor and middle classes.
You're playing right into the 1%'s hands by accepting their narrative. It's time to turn off your television, my friend, and take a good hard look at how the world really works. These men in power are not your friend, neither Rs nor Ds.
