What's a change output? 
Do you think the $180 worth of btc was put back to my gdax wallet? 
I can't tell because I had alittle more btc in gdax at the time of transfer but they don't show a history of withdrawals. Only history of purchases...

Hello. I figured it out. The transactions were running so slow that I was looking at the wrong transaction. I really hope this bitcoin blocksize debate ends soon and we're able to move on because these slow transaction times are getting ridiculous.

I'm not talking about the gov executing a 51% attack to take over the network. I'm talking about changing laws to effectively ban Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies so that it's not useful for the majority of the population.

"Wester liberal democracies would unlikely be able to implement such a penalty." Like what countries are western liberal democracies. I live in the U.S. and I feel oppressed but compared to more obviously authoritarian regimes, we're liberal and democratic here. Didn't the U.S. effectively "ban" gold?

The network wouldn't die, but in the case of crypto, there needs to be a way to buy it and if you can't purchase it electronically in exchange for fiat currency, whats the point? If Crypto's destiny is to go back to become underground money to purchase illegal goods and services, is it really useful and revolutionary as the likes of Antonopolous (who I respect greatly) is pitching the world? I know that there will be some utility even in such scenario, but in that case the current price for BTC is way over valued.

I acknowledged the risks you were talking about so anyone interested would know that this risk exists. And now it sounds like you're feeling personally attacked for some reason. All I was trying to do was put my word out there as well that I am no hacker, whether that means anything to whoever is interested or not is their decision. 
@_date: 2017-01-15 05:49:58
I understand the risk. The best anyone who's interested can do is look at my past reddit posts and judge based off that. It's just my word, but I'll just say that I have no computer hacking skills and I've never tampered with it. The product still has the clear plastic wrapper over the screen and it looks brand spanking new. No physical tampering such as propping open the device. Thanks.

I know this isn't very "crypto" of me but I could list it on ebay, for you to buy if you're really interested.

How would that work if governments simply ban transacting through a blockchain and blocks all businesses from using Bitpay or any blockchain payment processors? We'd be left with a small underground community of people transacting p2p.

I guess that point is still unclear. Either way, my point is that it shows the IRS has no control over collecting capital gains taxes moving forward. The only scenario I can think of is if a person  converts a fairly large sum to fiat which raises red flags. I know that it does if your traditional bank account suddenly gets a influx of funds and it's not declared on your tax return. So, any insights on what you think the government will do to regulate cryptocurrency?

I don't know anything technical about security but so far Ledger Nano S has been great on the user friendly aspect. Very intuitive to use and I now feel secure about holding some ETH and ETC as well.

I just read on another post ( that Coinbase just uses this "First in First out" method to calculate the cost-basis. It's not automatically reported to the IRS, although it sounds like they are trying very hard access our transaction data. Either way I was just trying to demonstrate that the gov doesn't have control over collecting capital gains taxes on cryptocurrencies. 
The purpose of this post is to have a discussion of ideas on how the gov may try to make sure they get their revenue and regulate. Like I wrote in the original post, I think that it's plausible that the U.S. gov would tax it. Japan currently taxes Bitcoin purchases but they'll most likely remove the tax in 2017. The way shit's going in the world economy, it's prudent for governments to encourage Bitcoin because the more people of a country gets in early, the more wealth it will create for their economy.
I also think it's plausible that they would ban payment processors (Bitpay) in order to slow down mainstream adoption.

Why? 
@_date: 2017-11-01 02:09:09
Is it possible to do this to all cryptocurrencies?
@_date: 2015-08-18 11:02:44
thanks for letting me know.

If they start printing tons of fiat to suppress BTC, our community can declare that we would fork to fight back. Plus we have so many other options in in alts. I know Btc maximalists won't like the latter idea but I think it's a losing battle for the fiat printers.

What I mean by that is this: 
Assuming that the bitcoin miners are working at full capacity, my belief is that the system will continue to raise difficulty which will require more resources (better equipment, more electricity, etc.) by miners. Theoretically, difficulty is supposed to go down, but the big miners have invested a lot of capital and the gap between the power of soloists/hobbyists and smaller businesses versus the big players will keep getting bigger. A big player going belly up may temporarily reduce difficulty, but it’ll also create a power vacuum most likely to be filled disproportionately by the biggest players that survived. I doubt there would be any smart investors willing to put money down to enter the mining business now. It’s not profitable. That’s where I make the connection between “cost of more resources required” and “more centralization.” The system massively favors the resource rich players that entered the game early. 
I'm just thinking out loud here, but maybe putting a cap rate on difficulty so that miners won’t have to fight a rapid race to zero would help. Slowing things down a notch may allow new players to enter the mining business as well as the soloists/hobbyists to catch up or stay in the game. 
I know I’m making a lot of assumptions here... Your thoughts?

Hey thanks for a real response to my question. 
What you've stated is how the system technically works and ensures that the system can continue to exist, but I don’t think it’s practical when applied to real world economics.
The large players in the mining community continue to drive up difficulty, requiring more resources by them. That, coupled with the fact that there's no hard cap on transaction fees that could be charged by the miners, ultimately the cap becomes how much the market will tolerate in fees compared to competition, say the traditional financial networks. 
This issue will only be exacerbated by stronger bitcoin adoption when demand for transactions would only increase. 
The dilemma bitcoin seems to face is, making sure fees are so low that it's a no brainer to switch to it from the traditional system which comes at the cost of more resources required and eventually more centralization. 
I don't know if this makes sense to you, but I just wanted to clarify what I meant by inflationary maintenance costs since you said you don't know how I think the system works. 
@_date: 2015-08-18 09:36:52
Thank you for your answers, it makes more sense to me now. You're saying that the cost dynamics boils down to supply/demand of transactions to processing capacity. Hope I'm getting that right. 
From the information I've gathered, Bitcoin was designed to be a deflationary currency by putting a cap on supply. However, there is no cap on the costs of minting and processing transactions making the system's maintenance cost inflationary. 
What are some sensible solutions being discussed in the community to address this issue of increasing maintenance cost? Sounds like the future of bitcoin relies entirely on solving this problem. Also, is that what the controversy about increasing block size is about? To be able to process more transactions so that it can be potentially more profitable for the miners as well as keep fees low? 
I'm new to reddit. Should this be posted as a new question? Thanks again.

Are you suggesting that we store the 24 seed in a encrypted format and store the password to the encrypted file on a steel plate?

Solidity is pretty much Javascript so I personally don't think it's a huge advantage as it's marketed to be.
