Thanks for the informative answers. And I won't judge you by the vile tripe that comes out of the bitcoin community if you don't do the same to me. I had genuine technical questions and you responded to most of them, all of it in a civil manner. 
I no longer believe that SW is wrong. It will work ok if everyone behaves the way you have described.
I still don't believe that it's a good idea. There are too many new things that can go wrong. The number of validating nodes will drop, for instance, and that's really bad for Bitcoin.
But let's wait and see.

If she says it often enough, perhaps it can become a reality? And what is "reality" really? If we all repeat the same thing, doesn't it become true? 
For instance, most people think that Ross was never charged with murder. If you hint that Ross is still being prosecuted in Maryland for the murder-for-hire, your comments will get downvoted by the pro-Ross brigade in an instant.

If I'm connected to an honest full node, I can get a valid block already, so what use would I have for a fraud-proof? Why would anyone furnish a fraud-proof to me? What would I do with that? And there are so many different fraud proofs that these proofs themselves can be an attack vector.
On a different note, does the person who initially created the fraud proof get something? Why would he create or furnish the proof in the first place?

You have Moore's Law exactly backwards. Assuming it holds for mining hardware, Moore's Law would say that mining equipment becomes obsolete, exactly as I described. Also, Moore's Law applies to a single chip, whereas the difficulty rises because people are bringing massive farms online. So any particular farm is overshadowed by the hashrate of the new miners coming online.

1. There were many others in addition to Hashcash. And granted Bitcoin was immensely successful, but an idea doesn't have to be deployed to exist, or for Bitcoin to borrow from. Satoshi himself readily admits where he got the PoW idea, why can't this community admit the same bit of inescapable truth?
2. Karma and MojoNation did exist. 
3. A hash-linked chain, or a timestamp service, creates a blockchain in the sense that Swanson is using it. So he's right, this technology goes back to the late 80's.
4. The claim was "if it's not immutable, it's not a Blockchain" (hint: it's in the title of the submission). The OP is going on and on in this thread saying that the Bitcoin block chain is immutable. Yet anyone who has half a clue will agree that the last few blocks are subject to change. They are mutable. If we adopt OP's definition, Bitcoin would not be able to use the term "blockchain." 
Look, this much is clear: the OP doesn't know what he's talking about. Swanson's use of the word blockchain doesn't harm Bitcoin in any way. Let's accept scientific facts and move on.

Thanks for finally enunciating your broken understanding. You seem unaware that the switch would be accompanied by a block version number embedded in each block. From the switch point on, the clients which are all running the new software, just don't recognize any blocks above a certain height that do not carry the new version number. 51% of the old miners can happily create a chain consisting of small blocks, but no one will recognize that chain. Reorganization of that chain will not affect the new chain with large blocks.

Could you describe the claim that sidechains help with scalability?
But start with the assumption that there are many sidechains, so two people wishing to transact have money tied up in separate sidechains. So it will take ~100 blocks for the reverse peg to mature and become spendable when shifting money from one sidechain to another. 
Sidechains are great for experimenting with certain kinds of extensions, but I don't believe they do anything at all for scalability.

You only now figured out the terminology -- you didn't know your ass from a hard or soft fork. I even went back and read your drivel to see if you mentioned anything about the fork strategy, and nada.
Let's get specific: you have no idea how the fork will be implemented. They can split at a &gt;1mb block, whose hash is baked into the XT clients, so all old miners are left behind. And it's a game of prisoner's dilemma, and the winning strategy is to defect to the new protocol. And in any case, by the time 90% of the nodes are XT, 51% of the hash power is not going to be running the old protocol. And finally, you did not describe any mechanism for why 51% of the hash power would collude to remain on the old protocol, while they do not collude right now to take over the currency. I realize that you have nothing but time on your hands, having converted your $362.38 to Bitcoins and now waiting to get super rich by doing nothing in a basement, and so you can continually come back and hurl another insult. You're the cancer that infects these forums, which is why I had you tagged as "moron". Go ahead and execute your "must have last insult in the discussion thread" strategy, it's funny to watch.

Those of us who have actually read and understood the Bitcoin whitepaper will readily admit the following:
* Proof of work preceded Bitcoin. The whitepaper cites prior work on PoW.
* Decentralized currencies preceded Bitcoin. 
* Hash-linked chains preceded Bitcoin. They were known as timestamp services.
* Bitcoin itself is mutable, though in a limited sense. The Bitcoin blockchain undergoes reorganization about 3 to 6 times a day.

The topic is the security model, and whether it makes sense to make a change in the security model without a hard fork. I appreciate your answers, but am not yet convinced that SW introduces no change to the security model.


No, that's a gross oversimplification. 
The question is about SFSW blocks, transmitted without witnesses. I believe you suggested a new bit indicating whether a block has been verified by the sender. So the vision for a full node is to propagate blocks as quickly as possible, without verifying, in the hopes that the required witnesses will arrive later and make everything whole again. 
In such a world, miners will *all* switch to SPV mining.
If they are nice, they will revert later after they notice an invalid transaction whose witness fails to show up, or when a fraud proof arrives. This will create orphans and reorgs. If they are not nice (i.e. they know that &gt;50% are also just like them), they will not revert.

No. There is an incentive to combining forces. If I make 12% with 10% mining power mining selfishly, and you make 12% with 10% power, together, we make more than 24%. Like 26% or so. So it makes sense for us to combine forces. We get rewarded for it.
If you pick some random scenario, do a half-assed job of describing it, then you should not be surprised that the scenario you half-assedly stumbled upon is not a stable equilibrium.

You're slowly getting it, but not quite there yet. Let me quote what I wrote earlier:

On occasion, someone in need of cash would make his private chain public, which would cause other miners with private chains to make their chains public. It'd be very weird and spurty, and difficulty would go all over the place.
You can see that it makes no sense to have N selfish miners. They are all better off it they collude.

False. When the selfish miner is at 10% and honest at 90%, the honest guys contribute about 88% of the blocks to the blockchain, selfish guy makes 12% or so. If you can't see why, you are not qualified to discuss Bitcoin mining dynamics.

No, 49.999% of selfish miners are sufficient to collect 100% of the block rewards.  What happens when any pool, whether selfish or not, surpasses 50% is unknown, because it depends entirely on their motivation.


If you had 10 10% selfish miners, the blockchain would stop making progress. But if one of them turned honest, he would make literally 0% profit. Every time he exposed a block, 9 selfish miners would expose a block.
You don't seem in command of these strategies. Parroting Felten was a mistake, which I think you learned from, but you seem to not be able to simulate the scenarios that you yourself make up. I can do this for you and try and get you to see how these strategies work, but only for so long. Your hand-wavy statements have been false every time. The thing about selfish mining is that it *is* counterintuitive. You can't just BS your way through. I urge you to read through and understand the strategy. And denying its existence isn't really good for Bitcoin.

Felten's problem in Fairweather Mining stupidity is that he thinks mining proceeds are divided among pool participants at the time the block is found. THAT'S NOT HOW POOLS WORK. He doesn't know about partial proofs of work, and he doesn't understand that a miner gets compensated according to the time he has spent on any one pool. Jumping from pool to pool will cause the miner to lose a lot of money. 


And if everyone subscribed to selfish mining, they'd all keep their chains private. On occasion, someone in need of cash would make his private chain public, which would cause other miners with private chains to make their chains public. It'd be very weird and spurty, and difficulty would go all over the place. 
BTW, I never assumed that everyone would mine selfishly. That was an assumption that you made. I am simply describing what would happen as a result. As you have come to realize, it is a ridiculous assumption to make. Selfish miners would tend to cooperate with each other instead of being selfish independently. WHICH WAS THE EXACT POINT OF THE SELFISH MINING PAPER.

You're really daft Natanael. And I see your posts on the "crypto" mailing list, where you're less of a shill and a bit smarter. Let's try again:
Suppose there are 9 10% selfish miners. They all have some private blocks. Some have a few more than others due to random variation. 
Mr Honest Miner comes by and reveals a single block. All 9 reveal a single block. There are now 10 forks. No one is any wiser.
Suppose Mr Honest works on a second block and reveals it. The others will reveal 9 more blocks, keeping the forks alive. 
Are you with me Natanael? This is not very hard if you have actually read the selfish mining paper. But instead you were cutting and pasting from people's blogs without realizing that they didn't know the first thing about mining.

I see, it's the honest protocol you don't understand. (You probably also don't understand the selfish one, but first things first):
All those honest groups would talk to each other and build on each others' blocks. The honest protocol never rejects a block discovered by a competing miner. They will collectively build on each others' blocks on the blockchain. You are getting confused because the selfish miner is indeed faster than any **single** honest miner, but he's slower than them working in tandem with each other. Since the honest guys build on each others' blocks, the selfish miner at 20% cannot do anything to keep most of their blocks out of the blockchain (though he will win more than 20% of the block rewards). 
I just rehashed for you the age-old argument about why a bad guy who owns less than 50% cannot attack the blochchain and determine its contents. If I'm at 20%, it doesn't matter how the remaining 80% divides itself into smaller pools, whether one giant 80% or 80 1%ers. I cannot overtake them and I cannot keep their blocks out. This is basic stuff developed by Satoshi. It is what makes Bitcoin interesting.
Since you didn't get this part, everything you said about the mining attacks was flawed. I hope we got to the bottom of this and things are clearer now. Please think this through and read the original whitepaper before you get lost in your own verbiage and handwaving.

Show us. The actual problems with the protocol are downvoted and researchers are brigaded. It's like the middle ages, and this sub is the church, and we're trying to ignore science.
Edit: Actual problems: (1) red balloons paper was not discussed here (which showed that miners have no incentive to propagate transactions). (2) selfish mining was buried (which showed that you could break the core mining idea behind the blockchain). (3) large mining pools are poopooed as issues that can be fixed by making noise (whereas they seem inevitable, and we seem to be veering towards ever larger pools), (4) actual value of money (I was embarrassed about the way we brigaded Krugman, a Nobel laureate, not what I want my kids to see), (5) doxxing and harassing naysayers. 
Also, spare me the "this is a large subreddit" BS. You all actively encourage and upvote the brigaders, doxxers, and the harassment, because you think you benefit from it. Sadly, at the moment, what's holding Bitcoin adoption back is the shitty community.

No, you clearly don't understand how selfish mining works.
When Miner X reveals a chain of length N, everyone else reveals a chain of length N. Only when the miner with the longest chain needs to make a real payment (i.e. 1/N cases) does the blockchain actually advance. That's with 1/N probability, (N-1)/N, we have forks and no clear winner.

You outlined a ton of reasons for why selfish miners would combine their efforts into one big selfish mining pool. This is indeed what the numbers indicate, and what the paper cautions about. You wanted to explore an alternative hypothetical, and now you realize (maybe) that your hypothetical scenario doesn't make sense. It says nothing about mining strategies in general. You made up a dumb scenario and slowly discovered that it would never arise in practice. Read up the comment chain and you'll see me say the same thing early on.




No, that it is not. Many armchair game theorists try to map real-world problems into one of a handful of games they read about on the Internet. You are now doing it for *two separate games*! Those two games have nothing to do with each other, and they don't model the current situation at hand. I'll focus on MAD because you attached fewer qualifiers to that statement.
There is no "mutual" or "assured" or "destruction" in Bitcoin mining. MAD relies on knowing your enemy, and knowing when they misbehave. When the Russians send the nukes, it's clear who sent them. So we attack them back. Knowing we will, they don't. 
MAD does not hold for a set of N actors (1) who are all anonymous and (2) whose misbehavior cannot be traced back to the pool that is misbehaving. 
This is all elementary stuff. Waiting for the next set of gibberish, because you can't seem to let go and go learn something.

Or some selfish miners, each with less than 50%, but exceeding 50% in aggregate? I told you about this scenario already. If they are rational, they'd stick together instead of mine independently.
One selfish miner with X%, and lots of little pools of honest miners? I covered that one as well.

Nope. A 34%er can lose every one of the head-to-head block races, and will still come out ahead. The key is that he's big enough that he'll be able to establish 2-block leads on occasion. There is no gamble associated with 2-block leads, and at 34%, they will pay off even when all 1-block leads are lost. 
The fact is that a savvy selfish miner will not lose every single head-to-head race, either. Even a small selfish miner can, in expectation, win more blocks than his fair share. But that is in expectation (i.e. "statistical"). A 34% doesn't need statistics, laws of big numbers, or lady luck on his side.

In your limited neckbeard existence, this "only happens in movies and TV shows."
In DPR's case, the allegation is that it indeed happened. A reasonable judge cannot take the chance that it will not happen again. 
What makes you think this is just a harmless computer dork? His mom's website? The fact that he looks middle class? The fact that he's white?? How many murderers have you seen? What makes you think you can judge them by how they appear online, or by what their mom says about them? How fucking old are you, mentally?

Andreas sells because he knows how to sell himself to this crowd. In fact, the main thing Andreas knows how to push isn't Bitcoin, but it's himself.

As much as you idolize him, he's just not doing it for Bitcoin: adoption has stalled.

And you assholes downvote every post that is critical of Bitcoin.

Ah, you're only partly right. Yes, even when there has been a total system compromise, the private keys for the original deposit addresses should not be lost. 
But the attacker can compromise the service, upload and give out his own deposit addresses, and thereby collect the deposits. 
Technically, the private keys of the original deposit addresses weren't lost, but the attacker ended up giving out new deposit addresses under his own control. 
So I can see how they can end up in the current mess they're in.

2. You can't meaningfully check the state of my network. You can't tell if it's oversubscribed.
3. If someone downloads CP, the AP owner has his house raided. Even if he were to establish some legal framework to avoid responsibility, which involves creating an ISP, the benefits of a few bits of bitcoin are just not worth the risk. Worse, people would install this service, download CP, and claim someone else did it.
Next idea?

I'm glad you're sticking up for your friend, but your response provides absolutely no concrete evidence that this guy was at all suitable for the job. I can only judge him by his actions, which I can summarize:
* Ryan announced Reddit Notes, even before it was fully clear what they were, and whether they could ever be made legal. They sure sound like securities, and everyone with a GED knows that there are stringent regulations if you want to do business in the US. 
* The Reddit Notes announcement was full of empty buzzwords. Sidechains aren't even a real thing, yet somehow we were going to get $5M tied to a sidechain. 
* Ryan leaked plans of associating bitcoin addresses with reddit accounts. I would never work with a group member who leaks plans of upcoming features to the users.
* The plan to associate bitcoin addresses with reddit accounts was broken. It is considered bad practice to use a single static address. He should have been generating a different address for each transaction. 
* His bumbling idiocy seems to now have killed reddit's near-term plans for Bitcoin. This is bad for Bitcoin.
* His online resume makes him sound like a kook. A grand unified theory of probability that ties information science with quantum mechanics, yet no funding through peer review, PhD dropout. This is the profile of a guy who dreams big but lacks accomplishments, and the ability to even identify his own bullshit.
So, I get it, you had drinks with him, you think he's personable, he's probably a nice guy in person, but we can only judge him by his actions, and he was not good for Bitcoin. Sure, call me a troll, that's the way of saying "you said something I cannot refute."

He was leaking corporate plans left and right. People do this when their ideas are being shut down inside the company, and they want to stir up a mob of users to get their way. 
Look, if Reddit adopts Bitcoin tipping in some broken way and people start losing their money, it would not be good for Bitcoin. His public address idea was bad practice -- you don't want a single static address. Ryan was just namedropping latest cool tech as fast as Danny Brewster, and his career lasted about as long. None of the things he mentioned (RN on sidechains, tipping via xpubkeys) are anywhere close to being realized. He may well have killed Bitcoin at Reddit with his antics.

Selfish mining is a mining strategy where the miner deviates from the protocol prescribed by Satoshi, and ends up making more money than he should. If the miner is larger than 34%, he is guaranteed to make more money with selfish mining than he would if he were mining honestly, and there is nothing anyone can do to Bitcoin to avoid this. If he's not over 34%, he may still make more than his fair share.
The core idea is to discover a block, keep it to yourself, and reveal it just at the right time. You get a head start on the next block, and the rest of the network in effect works on a stale block.

Your suggestion is unworkable and does not make sense.
A UTXO is not a free-standing thing. It's a transaction output, inherently part of a transaction.
Perhaps you're suggesting that the recipient of a transaction store the transaction and submit it when she wants to spend the coins. This sound ok on the surface, but think about it from the point of view of full nodes. When can they safely forget a transaction? How can they be assured that the recipient has a copy? In fact, where would the recipient get the copy from, to provide it later when she tries to spend the transaction?

Nope. If I give out cookie samples for free at the supermarket, TO ROBOTS WHO ARE GUARANTEED TO BUY A BOX OF COOKIES, is it "risk"? I'm guaranteed to come out ahead.


What if I buy 34% of the mining power for Bitcoin, mine honestly, but I hit an unlucky streak? It is still "risk." At these kinds of rates, in fact, anything over a few percent, the variance is too low to matter, and "hot streaks" and so forth do not matter. And miners don't follow mining pools with "hot streaks," because mining is a memory-less activity.

You know, there is no shortage of writeups like this: possibly containing some insights, but described in a vague and handwavy fashion, bereft of a careful specification or even guarantees, and certainly lacking an attack model and a proof of why the proposed scheme achieves the properties that it is claimed to possess. BTCTalk forums are notorious for this kind of discussion, and even the dev mailing list gets stuff like from time to time.
My suggestion to you is to one-up your game: write a specification for the protocol you are proposing, or else go ahead and implement it. Talk is cheap, and there is no shortage of "idea men" and "talkers". Satoshi was not a talker. For everything you can say in a handwavy way, someone can come up with a counterpoint. The proof is in the pudding, and talk is not pudding -- in fact, it gets in the way of pudding making.

We haven't done any such thing. It could happen and you'd be none the wiser. The miner could mine privately and then broadcast his transaction after he mines the block. There are billion things he can do to cover his tracks.


That's what happens in your fantasy wishful-thinking world. 
In the real world, no one would have any idea that the miner was in on it. 
In the real world, there are non-public mining pools, owned and operated by a single entity.
Historically, any time someone said "no miner would be able to do that in the long term," they were wrong. It's the mark of a shallow mind, to not realize that the long-term incentives of miners are quite different from hodlers, that they have many more options to cover their tracks than other uses, and that, generally, other people are not the same as one's self. Of course, libertarians are perennially unable to understand other people, which is why their game theoretic reasoning is always suspect and pretty much always wrong.

* I send them a tx, they ship me the goods.
* I send a double-spend tx to a miner as soon as I send the tx to the merchant. Merchant is unaware. I do not send this double-spend to the public network. I pay the miner to not send this transaction to the public network. So he doesn't.
* In fact, I do this with N miners. I pay them for this service. 
* When the block is mined, the money goes to the address in the second, double-spend transaction. The original tx I sent to the merchant is discarded. I keep the goods and the money.
Of the 6500 nodes on the network, only 10-20 ever see my double-spend. If I choose a large enough N, the probabilities are on my side. And I took no risk. At worst, I get the goods and the merchant gets the payment. But with high probability (as high as N times the hashing power of the miners I contacted), I keep the cash as well.

Alright, this is a bitter pill to swallow, but here we go:
* Do you see how the Bitcoin community cannot even make progress on the world's simplest parameter selection problem? Do you see how people with entrenched interests have pushed the blocksize debate into a long, drawn-out mess? Any new invention that needs any changes to Bitcoin runs into the same problem.
* Do you see how the Bitcoin community is full of deeply messed up people? A felony conviction seems like a perfectly OK thing to have around these circles. BitPay is headed by a guy who used to sell pictures of 13yo girls, Bitcoin Jesus used to store explosives in an apartment complex, there's Nicky Sullivan silently collecting everyone's data, Karpeles just went to jail for running an exchange full of $800M as if it was his own private piggy bank. Then there are the idiots around here with Sovereign in their user names, who presumably examine the flag in every court room for the gold fringe and refuse to submit to laws. Then the people who are using Bitcoin to evade their taxes, not to mention the morons who think Bitcoin will usher in an era of world peace right after it replaces all world currencies. Guess what? Normal people do not want to associate with kooks, felons and selfish assholes. 
* Bitcoin itself has technical limitations, but the cult-like mentality here is so bad that people can't even admit this. Every time an academic study comes out, everyone here attacks the academics, often viciously. This is not the sign of a science-based, rational community, and you know that the idiots who are repeating "maths-based" have no idea what kind of math, and when other math says Bitcoin has a flaw, they just lose their shit. Why do you think Bitcoin 2.0 companies like Ethereum are beginning to emerge? It's not because Bitcoin needed changing -- it's because Bitcoin governance and the Bitcoin community need to change.
As I said, bitter pills to swallow. Change and improvements start from within.

This is a dumb idea, one that known idiots like Ryan X. Carnated have pushed around. The bottom line is that Reddit needs upvotes to work, otherwise, no one would be able to tell apart the good stuff from the bad.

It's not antifragile if it happens manually. Also, indications are that Bitcoin is becoming more fragile over time, with regressions introduced into the code.

ChangeTip allows you to tip, in addition to Bitcoin and USD, in "donut holes" correct? So it's a different unit of account. The same way you buy onecoins with bitcoin, you can buy donut holes with bitcoin.
ChangeTip is managed by a central database under Nicky Sullivan's control, right? So it's centralized. The same way Onecoin holds onto your coins, Nicky Sullivan holds onto your donut holes, and can manufacture them out of the thin air.
You seem to get easily confused by ChangeTip's marketing, where they denominate things in bitcoins to get Bitcoiners to cough up their personally identifying information. When you've sorted it all out, I'm happy to talk. But in my experience, fuzzy thinkers can never accomplish this on their own. You'll just latch onto the next get rich quick scheme.

True, it might be a complication. If you can design a tit-for-tat scheme, you should. Bittorrent does this, in some sense: if you give me a block, then I prioritize you when sending blocks myself, and vice versa.

Why not start alternative forums? Why should anyone? We have the forums, we have the charity that we donated to, why the fuck would we NOT hold the guy in charge responsible?

I think the entire "colored coins" idea is based on being able to map anything onto a digital token. In essence, tokens serve as capabilities. 
In the example you described, being able to participate in the system/network is the incentive. One could keep track of this by using tokens as a capability to participate, and force you to earn these capabilities by carrying out actions that help the network overall.

Do you understand that the metric you're using for measuring "stability" has been widely debunked? That no one cares how many bitcoins are outstanding? That they care about being able to count on the value bitcoin represents? That they want something whose value is going to be predictable, despite fluctuations in demand for bitcoins? 
You must realize that many other currencies also had fixed supply curves. And the resulting economies were not stable because their currency was not stable, even though the production rate was physically capped.

Please see the dev list discussion for why sidechains are not a good solution for scalability. They are a good solution for altcoins, i.e. running different blockchains with different parameters. They are not good for scalability, because chances are that you and I have cash tied up on different sidechains, and it will require additional transactions on the main blockchain to get them to the right sidechain.
This is laughable. All we have is a name and some incomprehensible noise about what they might be. Wake me up when there's something real that has been proposed.
This is genuinely useful and can help scalability. By how much, and when it can get deployed, and how widely it will be adopted are all unknown at this point.

All of these questions apply equally well to Bitcoin transaction fees. Suppose you'd normally put $0.002 in a transaction. 
You're loudly making the point that you could *not* put that fee in that transaction, pay it to the first miner out of band, and have $0 for the second miner. Is this something that's possible? Yes. Just like submitting a $0-fee transaction is possible (e.g. you could pay $0.002 to a miner directly to prioritize your transaction). Does it break anything? No. If you submit a $0-fee transaction, and it doesn't get included, guess whose fault it is. And I'll call it out: it's not Satoshi's or Bitcoin protocol's fault. It's your fault for submitting a fee-less transaction.
Does this make sense? This split business has confused you. Just because someone can work around it does not indicate an issue. That someone is the only person who would be affected, and therefore he would not engage in that behavior. And the split isn't that crucial a feature of NG anyway, it's just a weak incentive mechanism, and any non-zero incentive would have been enough.

First off, get your BS right: you mean "the Web", not "the Internet." The Internet's origins go back to 1968, and no one was worried about ads or child porn back then because it was a DARPA project. 
I was there when the Web was first being developed, and NO SANE PERSON said that the Web was for scholarly activities only, and no sane person said that ads would be banned. To the contrary, people realized that content would be commercialized and supported via different means, most likely ads. No one wanted to pay subscription fees. 
I'm going to smack down every single one of you morons who makes shit up about the "early Internet." That includes Andreas, who was lying about how he had to carry around a card full of IP destinations so he could use email in 1992.

Except sidechains are not a scalability solution. When there are multiple sidechains, the chances are that your money is tied up on some sidechain and I want to spend it on another, so it'll require *two* regular Bitcoin transactions to get it to where it needs to go. So, sidechains will actually hurt scalability.
If you want to make instant payments with Bitcoin, or if you want to scale without having to worry about block sizes and centralization, look into Bitcoin-NG. Sidechains were a stillborn idea, and that's why there's still no actual *decentralized* implementation.

Ok, you seem quite daft. Let me break it down for you.
At the moment, the price is more or less stable, indicating that the current rate of supply (from pre-existing coins that are turning over, plus the new ones being minted) just matches the current demand. At the halvening, the supply will be cut. This will necessarily lead to a new equilibrium at a higher price point. This is Econ 101 material.
You claimed that there is no demand unless there's more awareness and blah-blah-blah. That's false. The demand at the moment is just right for the current supply.


Which college? Evidently, not a good one.

ChangeTip is very much a special case because their interface requires you to go to their site and log in with your various identities.

 * He pretended to be an expert with 200 publications at the DPR trial, and it was later revealed that he had absolutely 0 peer-reviewed articles to his name. things got so bad that the judge openly mocked his lack of credentials.
 * he tweeted about malware, telling people to adopt it.

Can you please summarize the concern(s)? I read the chatlog and the concern about double-spends is misplaced because a double-spending miner loses the entire subsidy.

It used to be just a generic "tip." But now it's "ChangeTip," The latter more accurately reflects what it is: a specialized, centralized currency. This is not Bitcoin.

Bitcoin no longer has any traction in Greek-speaking countries. 
It certainly has traction elsewhere, which is why I still kept a portion of my early mining proceeds in Bitcoin.

it's amazing that you're the only one who calls out this kind of sociopathic behavior.

Do we actually need more full nodes? 
The network has grown a bit since last spring when the number of full nodes dipped down. And usage is steady. We're nowhere near bottlenecked on SPV bandwidth.

Two nutcases have found each other. 
Vitalik needs this shitty idea for his crappy altcoin, this idiot needs validation for recycling an idea that has been around, and a failure, since 1997.

Fucked if I understand a word of what the hell you're trying to do. Why would I want to pay someone for crap they put up on reddit, without even seeing what it is? Do you not understand how the Internet works?

This is ludicrous. Bitcoin is dead in all Greek-speaking countries, namely, Cyprus and Greece. And the person who killed it? None other than Andreas Antonopoulos, with his erstwhile employer Danny Brewster.
That no talent ass clown endorsed Neo &amp; Bee, which was advertised heavily on Cyprus for months, and by extension was a big thing in Greece. When it all vanished, it permanently killed Bitcoin in these two countries. Andreas tried to distance himself, but the damage to Bitcoin's reputation was done. Of course, Bitcoiners being the gullible fools they are, you refuse to put any blame on your hammer-licking poster boy, who really was **bad for Bitcoin**.
Everyone kept telling you to not idolize people without credentials, but you all are so anti-authoritarian, you flock to people with absolutely no talent. Actually having skills and knowledge is a net negative in this subreddit. So it is with Andreas, Garza and the like. They spank your ass, and you guys thank them, like little submissive bitches.
Come on, downvote me to oblivion and try to suppress the message. The way is to try to suppress bad news, regardless of truth.

Every rippled instance queries a well-known host for its initial peer list.

Ah, the "appeal to authority" fallacy. In this case, the authority is "Bitcoin club run by undergraduates." 
I'll pass.

Thank you for separating the signal from the noise.


Only when someone is accepting transactions in a microblock whose value exceeds the block reward. Don't do that. Microblocks are much better than 0-conf transactions, but they are not foolproof. Nothing is until buried under multiple PoWs.


Not really. Microblocks seem strictly better than 0-conf.


Discussed on the email list. Leader is a key, not a node. How do you DOS a private key?

This bit of news is getting downvoted, even though it's a huge scam, about 1/6th of Bitcoin's market cap.
Then there are people who ask "who falls for this obvious scam?"
If you guys keep voting down bad news, how the hell are normal people supposed to be informed? They fall for these scams because of the downvoters.

Sidechains do not  exist. That paper is fuzzy and unclear.

WTF is this? Is that your correctness proof for a BFT protocol? There is no code that performs that "correlation." Ripple is broken.

So, this is funny. You're upset at this company for associating Bitcoin addresses with usernames, and to show your displeasure, you use ChangeTip, a company that associates Bitcoin addresses with usernames.

Glad you realize the futility of that task.


Peer-review is the *bare minimum* necessary, it is by no means sufficient. There are additional reputation measures; e.g. Evolutionary Psychology journals are peer-reviewed, but they are full of BS. But Andreas hasn't even reached that low bar.
@_date: 2015-02-01 16:15:13
There is also no mention of Neo &amp; Bee. 
Edit: You cowards who are downvoting this, explain to me why his CV should be sanitized and not mention his involvement with Neo &amp; Bee, a company that featured him prominently. Downvotes cannot bury the truth.
