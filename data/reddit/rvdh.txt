The issue is not that a fork is not within the terms of Ethereum, the issue is that a majority voted fork defeats the purpose of smart contracts.

Regardless of their other reasons, I think there are only very few people currently who don't hope to get rich by buying Bitcoin, emphasis on currently.

I'm amazed by how many people don't seem to get this... I guess they are blinded by their losses or maybe it's too meta for people to grasp. My money is on the former, no pun intended.
It's such an ironic thing to happen. This DAO debacle is the perfect example of something that smart contracts can prevent from happening in the future, given proper auditing of course. It would've been an amazing first test of the system. And yet, instead of taking it as a valuable lesson for the creation of all future smart contracts it seems like they're gonna do **the one** thing they should not do and in the same breath throw out the whole ideology that Ethereum was built on. They're even acting as if it was never intended to be a system where the code dictates the rules!
I've been obsessively following this story the past few days and it keeps flooring me. It's like we're watching a snake eating its own tail, utterly baffling. It's such an amazing, almost allegorical showcase of human greed. Books will be written about this event in the future, mark my words.

A whole new kind. I agree that bitcoin is not well suited as a currency right now but the idea is that it might eventually become the world currency, which means a truly massive amount of adoption still needs to happen. If we ever arrive at that point, so much value will be in bitcoin that everything else will be measured against it, which makes the idea of volatility irrelevant for bitcoin.
At some point, if bitcoin succeeds at that, there's bound to be a switch where all fiat currencies will start to get measured in bitcoin, bitcoin is only volatile right now because we measure it in dollars, euros, yuan, etc. You can do that exercise right now. Instead of saying 1 BTC is worth 2300 USD, you could say 1 USD is worth 0,00043 BTC, and that amount, for the past years, has continually dropped and it has dropped massively, making USD a very bad currency and an even worse investment, extremely volatile.
Until we arrive at that 'switch' I'm afraid we just have to ride this rollercoaster of insanity and as more and more fiat bleeds into bitcoin people will hopefully start to realize there is no use for them in a bitcoin world.

Yes, please enforce this! Put it in the sidebar and actively remove all posts that break the rules. If you don't have enough hands to keep up with it I'd be happy to help but someone's got to do it... It's making this sub lose a lot of its credibility.
Great design though!

I especially liked the argument he made for the fact that a currency is used for illicit activity doesn't make it illegitimate.

I'm guessing it's because the transfer confirmations between wallets take too long. I transfered some BTC from Bitstamp to Bitfloor earlier. According to Bitfloor it should take approximately ten minutes per confirmation (Bitfloor requires 6 confirmations), took my transfer two and a half hours to get through...
This is one of the major bitcoin problems that need fixing asap since it should balance out the differences between exchanges.

I propose using microbit rather than satoshi as a standard. It's elegant because if 1 µBTC is worth 1 USD then 1 BTC is worth 1 million USD and 1 satoshi, as the smallest dividable unit at the moment, would be worth 1 dollarcent. People could call µBTCs "microbes".

No but it might take some time to transfer them depending on the amount of verifications each exchange needs.

That's why it has to start with small retailers and second-hand marketplaces.
