What happens if we go below 12.8k tonight or by the time Asia markets hit again tmr? I have heard from a few people here and YouTube, discord etc that if that happens it may go down to 10k before heading back up. Is this realistic? I'm New but would welcome the chance to buy some more BTC at 10k as I started when it was worth more and had only gone that low or close to it one time and I was to new to have buy orders set or anything and missed out. My SMART GF did buy a bunch at 10k last dip tho so that's good ���� but yeah. Does that number 12.8k really mean anything to anyone that reads charts well? Thanks.

All a dip means to me now is a sale is happening somewhere

Same question I have
@_date: 2018-01-16 02:30:10
Link to the Twitter handle you mean possible?

For what it's worth I just started a bit ago and have made money so far. Have to read a lot into where you put any money and pick the right times of day (usually Asia FUD time) and be smart enough to hold longer if you have good vibes a coin will go for more....thats my biggest mistake so far....selling my ADA early....but you can learn fast if you sign up everywhere and follow ppl on Twitter use discord Facebook etc etc etc and sign up to any exchanges you can now before they stop taking applications  (have some referrals if you want and would be glad to use any you have for exchanges I'm not on yet...hard to find the time with a new baby boy) any way all things I never really did before but now help me more than I can imagine wanting to not have at my disposal crucial info on an ICO or coin or following the right ppl to get the info you need now like right now. And NEVER fall for any pump and dump telegram or discord channels please. If it's free it's probably a scam....

Maybe it's delayed in my end, I just stepped out for a moment I will try and figure out how to upload a picture and take a picture comparing what I'm talking about when I get back but if what was that a bug is true and there's no real way to manipulate the system then I'm not too concerned it's just very strange
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:15:57
Is that the cheapest? 
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:36:27
Brand new to crypto currency and a few days ago I bought some bitcoin and had my gf do the same (she decided to grab a Litecoin too after some research). We used coinbase to do it and it was easy. But now after some reading I'm interested in purchasing or following a few other (coins?) But not sure how to purchase them with coinbase app and have no idea what site or app to use for other coins. Also wondering what the best site to monitor the market is for noobs. Thanks.

From the U.S.? Only ask because I'm New to this and so far I have been told by 2 places they don't work with U.S. citizens bittrix and another I forget. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:43:19
Given that I need to make separate accounts then to buy other coins is it better to have all my coins in one spot or? It's all still a little confusing to be honest
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:45:13
How does one get the numbers to do this math and what math was done to get those numbers, thanks.
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:18:30
That is not really my concern or maybe I didn't word the question correctly but I can literally sell the Bitcoin I have on coinbase right now for thousands of dollars more than I can sell it for on Binance  what is to stop someone from selling on one platform and buying on the next considerably more profit than what you would paying fees to do this I'm also seeing the price reflecting what coinbase has listed on every other platform that I am aware of besides Binance 
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:39:07
From 300b to when is the consensus 500, 700 1trillion?
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:00:23
Did you find out how to track when you move things from one exchange to another I am trying to find an app in general free or to purchase to just organize my portfolio and have something easy accessible to look at it and know where I stand but every time I've tried one so far and start entering things something somewhere messes up or it's on me I'm about to try and create a spreadsheet that I can understand or something
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:23:24
Any better place than Amazon to buy one, what is the actual retail price they go from almost 200 to 2k atm depending on the store
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:23:25
Thank you, definitely a lot to research, also what is "cold storage"
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:09:46
I tried to use this site but it told me it no longer supports individual U.S. citizens. Is this real or was I on a fake site or something. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:54:35
Thank you, noted 
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:52:17
Ya.....thanks a ton
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:39:59
Either or, mobile access is always nice, but is it more or less difficult for a hacker to get into on either? And  does it matter what types of coins I place in it. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:21:22
Thank you, I will Check this out when I have a chance 
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:12:59
Is it normal for it to be thousands of dollars different on Binance for BTC actually every coin you can buy with cash is dramatically cheaper on Binance right now then any other platform I'm new and mostly only use Binance for trades is this a concern should I be worried, all my BTC worth so much less now 
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:46:32
I have to ask what fiat is, I just picture the horrible car
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:05:08
I got mine instantly on 1st purchase using some YouTuber' s link...then I referred my lady and she has since made multiple purchases over 100$ the first 3 for BTC and more later but neither of us got anything yet
... I myself have spent even more using her referral just takes me into the app on phone. Am I stuck with the YouTube channel link as who gets the 10? (Either way it's only happened once out of many purchases) and never for any that she has made.... think that we're going to use binance until I hear from coinbase or find a solution. 
Also is it just for BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:38:09
Thank you !

If only more people wanted to invest,  I'm New to this and hitting wall after wall in conversation about how it's about to crash from people who also know nothing about it lol.... I fear media and Isis connections influencing the people only informed by 1 network....
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:45:45
Ahhh, thank you
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:09:02
I honestly feel like the more I look into this and the more I read the more confused I become but I need to prioritise what it is I need to learn first and focus on that at least until I get the hang of trading to stop missing oit on buy prices or quick profits on fast gains and my goal is to take any money I make on altcoins right now and dump it back into Bitcoin but I tried for example when it was above where it's at now to put some of my profit aside on a ADA and it says suspended on Binance so what can I do about that... sorry I'm planning on making the post asking. I've  got like 50 things to take care of and just put the baby down so I'll do some individual Research into these things now that I've got some free hands but thank you for the reply and any suggestions on who to follow on Twitter or YouTube or what websites or blogs I should be checking in on would be greatly appreciated
@_date: 2017-12-16 08:03:06
This is amazing! 
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:18:22
Hmmm, oh yeah?
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:36:43
What is a satochi
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:32:43
But they have usdt, I'm just worried it's not just the BTC price, now it is accross the board
@_date: 2017-12-15 07:39:43
Uh oh
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:04:38
I'm totally new to this and having an incredibly hard time so far with the lingo in this sub and in general what exactly does bear &amp; Bull mean in simple layman terms, anyone? thanks 
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:41:12
So BTC isn't PC enough for some people or?
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:51:55
Ok, and I make a paper wallet (suggestion on a good guide on how to?)  then my coins that are in gdax or coinbase or something I want to hold I place where? Or do what with, I don't see how it still isn't there and hackable or I'm just that noob still at this =/
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:37:52
It's called just that or one that supports the currency ?
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:02:29
And site is down.... lol
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:48:38
How do I make my own wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:31:22
I already am ��. And okay so I can create the wallet and recover it before adding anything to it right, sounds like the best bet for now until the 1st and for the coins I plan to use and trade etc I am okay to leave in my binance or whatever until I can get what I would like to hold and then send to same wallet later ?
@_date: 2018-02-08 20:12:12
So I can read later when I have done so myself and also to read later today haha
