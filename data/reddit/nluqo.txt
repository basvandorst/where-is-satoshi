Putting salts in the database is a recommended practice. The point isn't to make that individual password harder to crack... it's to force a hacker to attack one password at a time.

I don't believe in Ray Kurzweil's singularity theory. His entire hypothesis assumes enormous processing power is all you need for AI. He acts like writing the AI is trivial... like the brain is trivial.

Derp. I glanced at it and thought the field was asking for your password instead of your email address. This actually seems like a great service.

The SHA-2 family is recommended by NIST until SHA-3 is chosen/released next year. So I generally use SHA-256 (one of the SHA-2 functions).
I've also heard some people recommend bcrypt, but I haven't looked into it very much: 
@_date: 2011-06-11 22:40:00
I agree basically that it's part of the picture. Then again the concept of neural networks has literally been around for 70 years. I think if it were as simple as that, we'd already have developed AI... just really slow AI (a universal turing machine after all can perform any arbitrarily complex computation, albeit slowly).
On the other hand, Kurzweil thinks we're going to reverse engineer the brain within a few decades. I just think that is ludicrous. The brain evolved over millions of years. There's no reason to think we'll be able to accomplish a reverse engineering in a few years.
Even assuming that we were able to essentially recreate a human brain artificially, what would we be left with? A human brain! Sorry, we already have a few billion of those and it has no bearing on achieving a "singularity."
Maybe I'd be less skeptical if the whole thing wasn't tied to quasi-religious idea of some entity allowing you to live forever. Kurzweil, like all believers in eternal life, thinks it will come just within his lifetime and he'll be able to literally resurrect his dead father. Good luck.

Urrrgh. Every exchange I hear about is making basic security mistakes. I keep thinking I COULD DO THIS 10X BETTER. Then I convince myself that writing a currency exchange is really difficult. Then I hear of another dumb mistake.

Wrong oh both counts, sir.
* I'm a certifiable mouthbreather.
* Seriously, I've been following Kurzweil for a while. I can't say I've read his books, but I've watched interviews and talks along with many articles. This is my favorite (lot of history behind this bet/site that I find interesting): 
The main thrust of his argument is rather simple: technological progress is exponential, not linear. I totally agree when it comes to processing power. But I see no reason that processing power is all you need for strong AI. Nor do I think reverse engineering the brain is going to be easy, but I could admittedly be very wrong about that.
Now, which parts of Kurzweil's argument do you think I'm misrepresenting?

Don't get me wrong. I'd *love* to have strong AI. I'd even like to work in the field if possible. I don't think it's inherently impossible, but I  do think the time table of a few decades is wishful thinking.
I'll quote Steven Pinker (copied from the wikipedia page on the singularity):


I also take issue with the fact that creating an artificial brain immediately enables you to create one that's smarter. Like I said, we already have 7 billion human brains. Human intelligence has been around for at least 100,000 years. Has that allowed us to create a smarter brain yet?
@_date: 2011-06-20 10:24:04
There's truth to this. Look at COBOL.  It's 50 years old and often called a dying langugage yet there are billions of lines of COBOL code still running out in the wild and many developers being well paid to maintain it.
On the other hand, jobs like that are probably really hard to get into and there isn't much growth. You're also restricted to work in certain areas (government, military, etc.) My advice as a developer is to learn several languages and never stop learning.
By the way, Coldfusion is not actually as bad as I had imagined (though of course I still have my gripes about it).

The salt prevents you from using any reasonable sized rainbow table. At that point, you're down to brute force.
At least from what I can tell, the salt isn't supposed secret at all (besides being in a database). I usually store in a separate column, making it totally obvious what the salt value is. I mean, you certainly get some added security by having a secret salt value.... but where would you put it if not in the database?
Not sure what you mean by dynamic? Aren't all the salts difference for mtgox or did I miss something?

That's fine, but I don't agree. I refer you to "No Silver Bullet" by Fred Brooks


If all technologies increased exponentially, I wouldn't argue. Planes don't get twice as fast every few years. The manned space program isn't increasing the number of planets it has explored.
Even Kurzweil's estimates on processing power seems overzealous. In that video, he says we'll have the processing power to simulate a human brain in 9 years. riplin just said above that we'd need 2 million times the processing power just for the neocortex (supposedly one of the simpler parts of the brain). Moore's law would predict, in 9 years, about a 20 fold increase in processing power.  Can no one else see the ridiculousness of these claims?

You would have a point if airplanes were invented by reverse engineering birds. In fact, airplanes don't work anything at all like birds do to my knowledge.
And of course, I would argue both are orders of magnitude more simple than the human brain.

I just can't square that with the fact that the guy simply [isn't that smart]( Sure, he's been winking and grinning at conferences for a few months, writing blog posts for a few weeks. This is evidence of what? That he's been trying the same con for many months? Why play dumb for so long if he has real evidence? Every stupid scam-ridden blog post and meandering interview is building circumstantial evidence against his case such that, even if he *does* eventually provide some low quality evidence, the whole story will be a lot less believable.

You're a bit confused, actively ignoring responses that try to explain the confusion, and calling people dumbasses in response to their offers to help. Is that really necessary? Here's one more attempt to explain it in good faith:
We know the signature came from the blockchain. No one is disputing that.
But the message and public key *also* came from the blockchain. **Craig has to replay all three.** 
Swapping in one signature for another without also swapping the hashed message DOESN'T HELP WRIGHT ONE BIT.
Are you arguing that he did both? Can you pinpoint the error that also swaps the message?
*If* he used such a script in person, he was subjecting himself to *spell checking by a programmer sitting right next to him* who we already know *did* catch errors (the missing initials). It makes absolutely no sense considering there are easier ways to swap in the blockchain data without any hint of foul play.
Not only that, but there's no reason for him to even execute that script in person. Per Gavin's accounts, it wasn't the verification script doing the verifying. IT WAS ELECTRUM.
On the blog, it makes even less sense. He can doctor screenshots as much as he wants.
**The only purpose of showing the script is so people can verify the blockchain data themselves** (presumably not knowing its origin). The "signiture" error actually makes that less likely. So I find it far more likely that it was either a legitimate mistake because he never tested the code or an intentional misdirection.

Lots of their early correspondence happened on public forums by the way.

Eh, I've been paying attention mainly to wrap my head around the techniques at play here and just wanted to share what I learned.
Also, to be perfectly honest it's kind of fascinating just how susceptible we are as a species to being conned. I can't turn away from this trainwreck.
@_date: 2016-05-05 12:34:31
I've seen speculation like this, but it doesn't make a lot of sense to me.
1) If he isn't changing the public key, Wright still has to be verifying *some* signature that was once signed with one of Satoshi's keys. Just because he gets to choose a different signature, I don't see how that makes the problem any easier for himself. If it's not another replay attack, it requires a cryptographic miracle.
2) The verification is expected to be done by the audience (the readers of the blog post or invited guests such as Gavin Andresen). And for invited guests that was stated to be done on a fresh laptop with Electrum installed. At that point, Wright's "signiture" script is rather pointless. For people following along at home, it simply wouldn't work.
This is why some of are saying *misdirection*.
@_date: 2016-07-02 13:40:26


It doesn't actually say signed. It says by *using* signatures, which is what he did. He did use signatures as part of his parlour trick.
It definitely could use some editing though.
