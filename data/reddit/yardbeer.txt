I got in at 7100, and I’m at the point where I’m just not checking price more than once a week. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:01:10
No worries thanks for the info reguardless.
@_date: 2018-01-23 14:24:34
GPU to mine alts more effectively. They have the option to sell said alts and purchase btc if that’s the route they want to go as well. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 01:40:38
Amen!!!! Not gonna lie I was expecting to get ripped to shreds for even saying that hahaha
@_date: 2018-01-23 20:52:46
@_date: 2018-01-27 03:26:01
Why resale at all? Used gpu’s aren’t exactly dependable in my experiences
@_date: 2018-01-31 14:05:49
Why is that?
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:12:15
Is nicehash safe to use now, after their recent “issues”?
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:12:36
I’ve been investing off those words since I started! And yes I know that for sure but for the short term I definitely want to have the best understanding possible! I’m somewhat new to btc as a whole and I’m just trying to educate all I can especially on big events like this!
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:25:55
Wasn’t aware of that! Even then, I mean what exchange allows you to move that kind of volume? I mean we’re talking on the upside of $250M in an instant. It was rumored that it was the winklevoss twins but this information is all from prior r/bitcoin posts so bear with me lol
Edit: no intention of knocking this sub what so ever! 
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:28:03
When I see my investment dipping mainly because of one mans shit greedy intentions, it fuels the fire so to speak haha not gonna lie I’m a little hammered and venting on Reddit which isn’t a great idea but hey who’s keeping track right? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:52:49
he’s an asshole if course he did haha im curious about all the posts I’m seeing with him, coinbase, CNBC, corruption, FUD, ya know the usual btrash/ver stuff that we see every day
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:45:09
Makes perfect sense, thanks again for this! Gotta say, I’ve gotten nothing but great experience and help from this sub every time I ask for it. Cheers friend and happy new year!
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:37:36
No worries! I appreciate the info anyways :)
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:56:15
Damn, I’m nervous 
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:36:01
Smart investment kid! Doing what you can with what you have, no shame in that! 
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:14:15
Wouldn’t satoshi have wanted to fork some teriyaki cryptokitty? It’s all part of the master plan.
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:18:40
Good to hear, I just have to wonder if buying an Antminer would be worth the money vs just investing that price into btc itself. It seems like a tough choice based on all the recent rises over short time periods. What would you reccomend the best asic “bang for the buck” would be?
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:03:10
Is it expected to rise like that again if there is a lightening adaptation? *hypothetically*
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:31:39
What time?
Edit: E/T
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:37:45
Extremely informative, thanks so much for this I really appreciate it!
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:39:31
Cheers to that 
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:33:41
Does anybody have any information as far as what the CME group trading btc will do to the price?
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:20:37
So last week when the price surged to 19k, I read that someone put in 6500btc (if thats not 100% accurate then a high volume regardless the # isn’t very important) and pulled out again from what I understand. My question is this: how the hell do you get THAT volume in and out of the market THAT fast??? I feel like it’s impossible and I’ve looked everywhere I know to. if everyone had that sort of speed day trading would become insane overnight
@_date: 2018-09-14 15:56:16
Checks out, lambo obtained.
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:46:02
As someone that’s not extremely educated on the topic, can someone explain to me what is up with coinbase, CNBC, and Roger ver? And is there proof?
As I said, I’m not as well educated as I’d like to be but I’ve learned enough to know that Roger ver is probably the most hated person in my life right now. I just want to know if there’s any truth behind what I’ve seen and how it relates to what’s going on with btc as well as all other currencies at this point in time 
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:11:11
This is exactly what I was looking for, and I hope to god you’re right haha thanks so much I really appreciate it!
Edit: just realized there was more than the first paragraph, that being said I hope you’re right about the first paragraph, and I really hope things are safe and stable long term
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:57:56
As in, they may ruin the market as we know it? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:15:21
Thank you for this
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:26:08
THANK YOU. I’m truly shocked this guy can get away with any of this. I could be wrong but btc has no “face” figure as satoshi was a pseudo and is that much more free of corruption as btrash has the face of ver who is abusing everything thrown at him yet still has no negative outcome. Irritating to say the least.
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:04:45
Couldn’t possibly agree more haha
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:09:33
This might be a stupid question, or maybe even a question better suited for a different sub but is it possible for mining to ever become profitable again? I’m fairly new to cryptocurrency and gave mining a shot just to better understand it (which I still don’t as well as I wish I did). I understand block “difficulty” goes up, and I don’t really see that changing but I figured I’d get some opinions or info if anyone has it! Either way happy investing everyone, these are some exciting times in the world of crypto :)
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:53:21
Does anybody know what’s going to happen to bitcoin prices once the futures trading begins? Is this good/bad for btc? I can’t get a good answer out of anyone 
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:59:15
If people are buying in at this price though wouldn’t that push the Burst off further as more invest?
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:45:58
As I replied to someone earlier, I think it’s because there is a “face” behind btrash unlike bitcoin (core if it even needs said)
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:27:49
It’s more out of curiosity, I’m in this for the long haul believe me 
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:27:01
Is there an expected rise in Jan?
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:50:46
Gotcha, Would you that this is a decent plan? 
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:19:19
Nice! Best of luck!
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:10:28
I’m kind of new to it but it seems like the bitcoin sub and the btc sub are at war with each other. Personally, I️ see no reason to get in some kind of argument over a stranger’s investments. “To each their own”, and best of luck to anyone investing in anything as far as I’m concerned!
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:03:10
Will that 23.8% apply to nicehash if I’m selling my mining power? 
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:09:40
I️ gotcha, thanks for the info, I️ appreciate it!
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:30:06
Thank you for the info! I’ll definitely do my trading there. I’m excited to see what this CME situation does to the price!
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:25:48
That’s where I’m at 100%. But would using nicehash actually help the situation? I️f it would benefit at all ill run my GPU all night. Not the best but it’s all I️ have to do my part. Any info would be great!
@_date: 2017-11-25 10:30:25
Enjoy your yacht and early retirement! God damn haha
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:25:26
Mines in the mail already! That’s exactly what I️ wanted to move towards. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:59:20
I haven’t pulled any crypto but I can definitely tell you, it’s worth letting Uncle Sam grease his palms with your investment instead of dealing with the consequences. Paying is anyone’s choice, but it’s a pretty serious gamble to risk getting charged with tax evasion. The way I look at it, it’s free money and if you have to get rid of some to legally retain most of it, so be it.  But hey, “To each their own”. Happy investing!
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:14:25
I️ don’t pay electricity, and tried with a GPU just for the hell of it. Needless to say I️ sold that very GPU 2 days later and invested that money into btc. Within a few months I️ will have made more off price increase than I️ would have mining at a few dollars a day over that same amount of time. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 12:39:38
Definitely checking this out!
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:09:12
The fact that they’re 2 different cards wouldn’t effect anything? Also thank you this is exactly what I was looking for!
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:12:26
I️ believe it only has to be claimed if it exceeds a value of 20k.
Disclaimer: not a tax professional 
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:40:20
Just saw 7980, I can’t wait to see that big 8!!
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:10:28
I️ use it to monitor stats but that’s about it. I’m new to btc as a whole honestly
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:21:58
To give you an honest answer I️ can’t really tell you because I️ lack the knowledge. I’m somewhat new to the btc game and I️ don’t want to give any false information that I️ wouldn’t want to stand by regarding antminers longevity for mining profitably.
Edit: fuck apple and this stupid “I️” thing
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:19:08
Would mining possibly help right now? I’m running nicehash but if I️ could help the situation idc about the pennies of btc I’d get. I’m mainly just trying to “do my part” in helping through this time.
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:45:55
What I would give for those cards haha
@_date: 2017-11-14 13:55:02
Btrash is probably only used for buying mids lul
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:30:13
I’m in it for the long haul! Are there any more expected forks for the coming year? 
@_date: 2017-11-14 12:57:35
CME group is adopting btc the 2nd week of December. I’d say buy ASAP because the prices are likely going to break records once that gets implemented.
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:27:40
I’m hearing GPUs can only make pennies a month but my hashrate combined are suggesting about 2$ a day, is that based on difficult maybe?
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:26:04
Of course! That’s why we’re all here :)
@_date: 2017-11-14 12:50:21
In HODL we trust ��
@_date: 2018-11-20 01:40:09
Well if I don’t buy now it should be around 25k tomorrow. So you should be aight 
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:07:58
Can someone explain to me why exactly the price dropped this exponentially recently? I understand a price correction is healthy for growth and whatnot but I’m not sure what’s causing this price to plummet how it has been.
Obviously news spreading FUD every time there’s the slightest drop in price could have scared off new investors, or maybe the tether thing is really shaking people off crypto, idk I’m just curious if anybody has some insight I’d greatly appreciate it!
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:18:04
Thinking about pulling out completely and just buying back in once it bottoms out. Never thought I’d be saying that
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:04:59
Thanks for the detailed comment, this is what I was looking for :)
@_date: 2018-02-06 18:51:35
Pepperidge farm remembers
@_date: 2018-02-07 18:50:43
This should be its own post on this sub honestly. Thanks for the info
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:21:58
I’ve been in for about 2 years now, but you’re dead accurate when you say a small crash “signals the end” haha it’s been the end 50x
@_date: 2018-07-02 19:20:05
I was thinking it was in a long since forgotten turkey sandwich
@_date: 2018-07-19 20:32:09
