Without knowing what your business does, I'd pick a state that does not require money transmission licensure, which looks like [South Carolina]( or [New Mexico](
[This possibly outdated article]( includes Montana. IANAL, but I think it depends on exactly what your bitcoin related business is doing.

FYI, selling/spending bitcoin is a taxable event regardless of whether you immediately repurchase it (at least in the U.S.).  It could also impact whether you have long term or short term capital gains.
@_date: 2015-06-17 22:04:15
Regardless of the volatility of an instrument, earning interest on it is always preferably to no interest (assuming the same default risk).  
If you already have some bitcoin that you know you're not going to spend or sell anytime soon, then why not earn interest on it (assuming you trust the counterparty you're lending it to)?

Lots of people feel the need to diversify and not put all of their coins in a single online account.  Lots of people that are interested in Bitcoin have accounts with lots of exciting new startups.  I've got dozens of online accounts with nominal BTC balances plus dozens of cold storage, paper, and hardware wallets, and most of those wallets have lots of addresses.

Their exchange rate is at a 1% premium to the market and they limit the amount of USD you can withdraw per week.
@_date: 2015-06-17 14:43:25
FUD? really?  It's just the way taxes work.  When you sell property (which is what the IRS classifies bitcoin as) it's a taxable event.  That's not FUD, it's life.

Neither [Stellar]( nor [TT]( support any bitcoin markets.  TT is quite litigious about people creating their own price ladders.

I didn't say that.  I asked a question.  If the OP wants to avoid banks, then an exchange isn't going to work, but the OP hasn't told us if avoiding a bank is a requirement.  For most people, keeping USD in a bank account is not a big deal.

FWIW, once when trying to withdraw $5000 from Circle, I had to answer these questions before they would send the funds:
1) What is the source of these funds?  
2) What is the purpose of these transfers?  
3) What is your primary occupation?  
Also, once I wired USD to itBit to buy BTC.  When trying to withdraw 60 BTC I had to answer these questions before they would send the coins:
1) Please describe for us your source of funding for these XBT purchases. If employment is your source of funding, please provide us with your location of employment and your official title/job role.  
2) What is the purpose of your trade activity at itBit. Are you an active trader or is this a hobby? Will you trade these XBT at other exchanges?  
3) What 3rd party wallet service are you transferring your XBT funds to?  
@_date: 2015-08-09 01:27:17
I think it's KYC/AML rules.  So, it could happen with any company that's letting you withdraw USD.  I'm guessing it won't happen the first time you withdraw (it wasn't the first time for me at either place).
@_date: 2015-08-15 13:59:19
Why not just sell them on an exchange and withdraw the cash?
@_date: 2015-08-15 18:51:55


How did you come up with that?  Their [balance sheet]( shows $2.1T in Assets, $1.86T in Liabilities and $0.24T in Stockholders' Equity

I see.  I was thinking it would make sense for a lender to also be in the debt collection business, but I get your point.
@_date: 2015-08-15 15:23:51
That's the way it works for me, but after digging deeper I see that they do allow you to hold USD if you live in one of the [available states](  So, perhaps you can switch back and forth between USD and BTC without involving a bank if you live in one of those states.
@_date: 2015-08-29 17:20:17
what percentage of all lenders on your platform have a positive return?
@_date: 2015-08-15 22:22:39
If the borrower is in the U.S. and the amount owed to you is at least a couple hundred bucks you could send it to a collections agency, or you could go to small claims court.  If it's for less than a bitcoin it's probably not worth pursuing.
@_date: 2015-08-15 16:55:11
After doing some more research, if you have an account at one of [these banks]( the deposits/withdrawals are apparently instant.
@_date: 2015-08-09 01:31:19
By they way, neither of them required *proof*.  I just sent an e-mail answering the questions and they approved the withdrawals right away.

They claim to have 2.4M users.  All it takes to create an account is a fake name and a fake e-mail account (you'd only need a real e-mail address to be able verify it, but you'll be counted as a user before you're verified).  I doubt there are any coins in the majority of their "accounts"
@_date: 2015-08-09 00:10:39
search Google Images for "tt price ladder"
@_date: 2015-08-09 00:30:44
The features of TT's price ladder that people value is that the prices are static (and the bids and offers move up and down), the user can re-center the ladder, and 1-click trading.  TT has patents on those features and they sue everyone.
@_date: 2015-07-06 02:55:04
I think [coinsetter]( does that.  I haven't tried it though.
@_date: 2015-08-13 23:12:34


Then, speaking generally, what are some common reasons that you take this action?  What should your users do to ensure this doesn't happen to them?

If BTCFlex actually pays out 0.15% per hour, then if you invest 1 BTC and let it compound you will have 503,910 BTC in just 1 year.  It almost sounds too good to be true.

You don't need to own coins to make markets, you just need to borrow them.

I think the point was that it could be a bank trying to use the blockchain, not trying to destroy it.

Can you point to a block HaoBTC has mined?  Or, are you part of pools?
@_date: 2015-08-15 14:02:43
For trading? Every time you buy/sell, it involves an ACH to a bank which takes days.
@_date: 2015-08-14 22:47:45
honest question: why is that bad?
@_date: 2015-09-25 00:23:10
I don't think it's that 10% of the world's GDP will be invested in bitcoin.  I think it's that assets will be on the blockchain -- smart contracts, [cryptobonds]( and the like.  Notice that the article says the blockchain is currently worth $20bn.  That's quite a bit more than the market cap of bitcoin.
Also note that "For purposes of the survey, blockchain technology was broadly defined as "an emerging technology [that] replaces the need for third-party institutions to provide trust for financial, contract and voting activities"."
In other words, not limited to the bitcoin blockchain.
@_date: 2015-09-24 20:55:18
agreed, but when he said it that way someone told him they weren't his coins.
@_date: 2015-09-27 17:31:22
Can't you sell on the Coinbase exchange ("maker" fills are free), and then ACH withdraw for free?
@_date: 2015-09-27 19:37:58
Assuming you're in the U.S., go to  to do your USD/BTC conversions. Here are the fees for trading:

Aren't you the same person that said you sold a bunch of bitcoin for cash and wanted us to tell you whether that was legal or not?

you heard them say they make money?
@_date: 2015-09-23 16:50:43
No one seemed to notice yesterday that they all of the sudden implemented limits on the amount of bitcoin you could send out of your wallet per week.  They also drastically reduced sell limits.  I don't understand how it's legal to change your terms such that people cannot withdraw their money with no prior notice.
@_date: 2015-09-20 00:34:11
[pie charts are the worst](
@_date: 2015-09-24 20:44:42
because they keep an accounting record of who legally owns the coins and let people withdraw coins that are legally theirs.

My weekly withdrawal limit went from $5000 to $300.  And there's now a limit on the amount of bitcoin I can send, which never existed before.  Now I've got money stuck in Circle that I will have to withdraw over the course of weeks.
@_date: 2015-09-22 13:15:48

On Bitstamp there are hour-long periods where size is traded on the bid, then on the offer, over and over.  One possible explanation is money laundering.  If a couple people have a bunch of ill-gotten gains that they want to turn into legimate income, they could open an account as a market-making business and open another account that continuously lifts the offers of the market-maker and then hits its bids.  They wouldn't be too concerned about the fees because it's still a lot cheaper than other methods of washing money.
