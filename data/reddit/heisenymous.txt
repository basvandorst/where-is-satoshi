Volatility wasn't what I was attempting to point out here. But I will address it:
I feel that people who are trying to ignore comparable volatility are just trying to satisfy themselves about the potential fizzle-out of Bitcoin. It could go either way! But I am tired of hearing people complain about its volatility. Yeah, it's hella volatile. Just like most EVERY investment. It'a a brand-spankin-new currency for crying out loud, and there's a lot of confusion around it. I expect volatility. But that doesn't mean it will fail. 
What I'm attempting to explain here is that I feel the word "volatile" is being used as evidence for Bitcoins eventual demise. Why would volatility destroy Bitcoin? Volatility didn't destroy the S&amp;P 500, Facebook or Twitter.
Lastly, this post wasn't intended to compare volatility, but rather to compare growth and adoption over time. The beginnings of each of these three charts are nearly identical to Bitcoin's early adoption and growth pattern.

Your concerns, good sir, are not legitimate.
.1 Bitcoin is not 1 Bitcoin. It is .1 Bitcoin. 
Yeah, 1 can be divided into .0000000000000000000000000000000001 trillions of times. But that doesn't make the value of 1 any less than the value of, well, 1.

I like this idea. I've been having some fun with the encryption tools available to triple encrypt my wallet.dat backups, (requiring 3 passwords, unlocking successive folders until the wallet.dat is found) so even if they're somehow stolen, access TO them would be nearly impossible. Even if it was done, the private security key is still encrypting the USE of the wallet.

I do not believe it's a bubble. I actually don't believe in bubbles at all. I believe things come about that people see as valuable and sometimes they take, sometimes they fail. Bitcoin? I believe will take on a massive scale (and has already started). The argument about Bitcoin being like Beanie Babies or Pogs really doesn't make any sense to me at all, as they're not collector's items. Bitcoin is currency and a digital gold standard all wrapped into one. What we couldn't do with gold back in the day (carry it around and spend it), we can now do with Bitcoin, as a digital form of gold. Beanie Babies and Pogs were never currency. They only held value because of their limited collector's appraisal. And their "market" was only limited to people who liked such things. Bitcoin doesn't require a fascination with Bitcoin to get involved. Whereas, with Beanie Babies, you kind of have to like Beanie Babies. Anyway, to get back to what you were asking... Bitcoin is still damn new at least in the timescale of currency age. I think it is a volatile asset that will have ups and downs on a general bull-ish trend line and if you're in Bitcoin for the long-haul I do not believe you have anything to worry about and in fact, have everything to look forward to. I also believe we will be seeing less and less of such massive market corrections as we saw in april/may. More public awareness, adoption and acceptance is only going to stabilize and speed up its growth in value. 
(all of the above is IMHO)

CoinBase allows up to 50 per day. It would take you 10 days with this method. Honestly, I think diversification is your best bet if you're looking to sell off 500+ BTC...
A bit on LocalBitcoins.com, a little on exchanges, a little on CoinBase, a little on BitStamp... I don't think there would really be any "fast" way to do it. Although, you may get a sell order for 500 to go pretty quickly at the bottom of a nice pullback or 50% or more on the Bitcoin price. But then again, selling low is not a good idea if your goal is to get the most Bang for your Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:20:05
When I initially bought my BTC at $127, I was expecting the price to hover in that general area for WAY longer than it did, and I wasn't expecting to get beyond $500 before the year ended. (that was a week ago)
I believe I estimated to a friend, $500 by 2014 and $1,000 by December 2014... Of course, crashes in between rebounds may make these estimates true... but then again, it seems popularity and demand are making your proposition much more likely.
I do believe there will be a correction. But not more than the previous correction in %. I'm going to bet on a 40% maximum market drawdown when it does happen, followed by a quick recovery as the rush of discount buyers comes in.
To answer your question... I believe we've seen enough in the last 12 months to conclude that at this point, anything is possible. $5,000 is possible. But so is $5.00. 
Now, comparing the two? I believe $5,000 is much more probable than $5.00... and if I were to bet with someone on whether it will hit $5 or $5,000 first, I would place my bets on the $5,000.

Yeah, but the dude (or gal?) never paid more than $25 for the bitcoin he/she spent on the pizza, if not less... he/she made out at the time, buying some pizza. The idea of Bitcoin isn't to just make money off it. The ultimate goal is to buy and sell WITH it.


First off, this is assuming that your little "don't spend bitcoin" scenario is real. Which it's not. People will spend bitcoin, buy bitcoin, sell bitcoin and ultimately, enjoy bitcoin.
Come on. Are you fucking kidding me? You could say the same damn thing about the USD/EUR, USD/CYN, etc.

I'm not 100% sure I understand your question, but I'll attempt to answer.
The price of bitcoin is whatever price you see at that moment. This will vary depending on the exchange you go through. Going through a place like BTC-e or CoinBase will get you a little bit better of a rate than say Mt. Gox or BTC China (where they really love to rally lol).
Also, if you HAVE bitcoin, the USD you'll receive for selling them will also depend on the exchange you go through. The cool thing is (and I'm looking at doing this myself), there's quite a substantial difference in the exchange rates between BTC exchanges. For example, as of this writing, BTC-e is at $326.49, while Mt. Gox is at $369.36 Buying BTC at BTC-e and then cashing them out at Mt. Gox will get you a little $43 profit when you withdraw to the bank.
I believe we call this Exchange Arbitrage. Taking  advantage of the discrepancies in price across exchange networks.
*edit - I assume USD, but the above can apply to any currency that can be exchanged for BTC.

In my opinion, we can't have a utopian society with the current system in place, because we don't currently have a utopian society with the current system in place and it's as simple as that. Inflation, regulation, centralization, uncontrolled and unlimited creation, security holes, counterfeiting, credit, to name a few.
To add further support to this argument however, I'd like to provide that as long as a currency can be controlled by an "elite few," that currency cannot be used for a utopian society.
The top 1% own more wealth than the 99% combined. That doesn't work. The 1% may experience a nice lifestyle. But it is by no means utopian.
Bitcoin allows worldwide transfer and exchange of value, goods and services with an encrypted, Peer-2-Peer, global, decentralized and transparent network, sured up by a finite supply (21Million) of inflation-proof, impossible-to-counterfeit digital currency while also allowing security far surpassing that of even the best banks in the world.
This puts financial responsibility BACK into the hands of the 99% - it isn't owned by anyone and it is owned by everyone all at the same time.

You could always pool a classroom Bitcoin wallet that only you control, then have them vote on buy/sell/hold... Then you can probably start with like .5 BTC or something smaller if you want and they still get to experience the joy of Bitcion. You can make it a goal to hit 1 BTC and then say, the whole class gets an equal share at the end of the course? I like that you're a high school teacher looking to teach your students about Bitcoin. No teacher in their right mind at my old high school would have done such a thing. I do realize you're web-based, but even so. Kudos to you.
*edit - adding this:
You could make it really fun, having each of them put together an analysis of bitcion, key price points, obstacles and targets, and have them present it. Then when everyone has presented, based on that, hold the voting session? I don't know how your classroom environment works, but if that can be implemented, I'm in my 20's and even I think that would be fun.
*2nd edit - one more thing:
You could assign to them all to go to the bitcoin faucets, then use that collective amount of bitcoin as a result of the faucets (say for, 2 - 3 weeks of faucets) as a collective bitcoin starting capital that they send to the classroom wallet... This would help you avoid having to invest in it yourself with fiat.
ANOTHER alternative to that, is having each of them (with parental permission) give like, $10.00 to the cause.

As a newcomer, DEF buy. As your interest and education grows, consider mining at your own discretion (but only once you really understand it), no one here can tell you what to do. But with your current computer, you're best skipping it for now. I'd go for LocalBitcoins.com - you'll get a deal down within a few hours if you really go for it. The bitcoin gets stored on your LocalBitcoins address, and from here, you can send it to any of your personal addresses. [Just be sure they're secure.](
Lastly, I wouldn't recommend trying to "cash out" of Mt. Gox. If you're going to cash out (with fiat money you intend to use outside of Bitcoin), sell to CoinBase or LocalBitcoins.

Because Pokemon cards are Pokemon cards and Bitcoin is Bitcoin.. You kind of have to have an interest in Pokemon to see value in the cards. I for one, burned all mine just to see what color they make.. Bitcoin, while the value may be speculative (albeit, accepted), is useful to a broad range of people and can be used by them, regardless of their interest in it. Can you instantly transfer money across the planet with Pokemon cards? Maybe if you send them in the mail. But that would take at least a week and then you have to convince some nerd that they should buy them from you, in order to get the fiat out of them. Then you run the risk of never receiving them, having them destroyed, you only get one copy. Show me a local business that accepts Pokemon cards as a payment option. Or beanie babies. Or tulip bulbs. Or Pogs. They're nothing like Bitcoin. Therefore, not comparable.

Gonna have to agree with you again. Only reason I went down the "dollar" route, is because right now it's the world reserve currency. Boy I feel really safe, what with the currencies of the world being backed by the dollar, and the dollar being backed by, well... faith en masse. lol

What if we consider that the last "crash" (something I would rather consider a correction), took place when the price exploded to new heights by a factor of 8.4 times? If a similar trend continues, we won't see a crash until around $2000-ish.

Possible for sure. Will take some time to get set up properly.

The dream I had, I was in a neighborhood and looked in the sky, it zoomed into the sun, and it kind of "exploded" and the whole sky turned red and basically, well... let's just say Bitcoin wasn't a concern anymore (Bitcoin wasn't in my dream, I'm just saying for the sake of context - in such an event as in my dream, Bitcoin wouldn't matter anymore)

Investing in anything includes a certain amount of risk lol. Investing in general is risky business. That's not really a surprising fact. Regardless of *how* or *why* the investing is being done, it is going to be risky. Everyone has their reasons for investing in Bitcoin. They're not all going to be the same reasons.
Rest your worries about the entire collective Bitcoin community investing with ignorance. Yes, there are ignorant investors in Bitcoin who may just be trying to catch another "trend" (though I believe this is far more than another trend).

The easiest (less secure) way is to download a Bitcoin wallet and password encrypt it (can be found in menu on Wallet app itself), then once you have secured your wallet with a solid password (make it REALLY solid), copy your wallet address that the Bitcoin client made for you, paste it into the send/withdrawal field in CoinBase and you've got it! Alternatively, (more secure) you could go to bitaddress.org, disconnect from the internet, generate a wallet with a security key and send your bitcoin there. This would be a paper wallet though. Withdrawing from a paper wallet is a little more tedious than withdrawing from a cold storage wallet (like the first example I gave you). Hope this helps..

The way I'm starting to feel is, it doesn't matter if the "value" of bitcoin against other fiat goes down. What matters is that the quantity of bitcoin I have (the truly valuable) remains the same. And it does! The dollar will go up and down all it wants, but my bitcoin quantity remains the same. Fiat is the training wheels into the transition of a new financial era. Bitcoin is the 2-wheeled bicycle. Soon, the training wheels will no longer be needed and the big boy can ride on his own. By then, we'll have an established and somewhat consistent value for goods and services in exchange for Satoshi's (because when everyone is using it, very rarely will we see someone spend more than a whole Bitcoin or two). 
I feel as if what we're seeing today is the reversal of an inflationary economy, balancing back, going to its old roots, while moving forward in a totally new horizon. A horizon without fiat. Fiat grows less and less valuable while more and more, people are finding on a daily basis that the need for true true value is not optional. And (conveniently enough, although, I feel it was created by someone or a group of people with extraordinary foresight) Bitcoin comes at a great time, when people just begin losing faith in a currency backed by nothing but faith and rogue governments grasping for control only add fuel to this flame.

I'm just going off (personally) positive experiences with them. I have also been seeing a few posts of people saying their issues were resolved.

Yeah agree, plus: Bitcoin doesn't really do you much good if you just want to keep it forever. Then if a mass exodus occurred from Bitcoin to say, Litecoin (in such an event that someone had 51% of the econ), the value of Bitcoin would drop and all his power would be deflated.

I'm personally keeping all my stash offline. It takes like 5 minutes to send the bitcoin to another address from a secure wallet in cold storage so for me that's "instant" enough. But I did purchase my first 2 bitcoin from CoinBase, which took a week. I'm now verified though, so I can buy up to 10 per week, instantly, and up to 50 per day on the "waiting game" that takes about a week to fill. I don't KEEP my coins in CoinBase.
The things you're considering for security are not the biggest concerns. Consider DDOS attacks, hacking, etc. that could potentially compromise your Bitcoin stash... no LLC is truly safe from the WWW as long as it exists on the WWW. If you MUST have your coins on an online Wallet (like, there's no stopping you and it's going to happen regardless), I'd suggest CoinBase. They have a pretty nice 2FA and a good professional feel about them. Mt. Gox feels too cartooney for my taste, and I get a rather "unstable" vibe from them and their price seems a bit biased from the rest of the Bitcoin exchanges. I conduct my trading on BTC-e. :D

I think you would do just as well by revealing your new chat room here, without BTC incentive... advertising 0.00000001 BTC as a reward for signing up is like paying someone 1/10th of a penny to join facebook. They're likely to do it regardless of the 1/10th of a penny... haha
If you want BTC to give your sign-ups a boost, I'd up the ante a little, to at least $0.05 - $0.10 worth.

@_date: 2013-11-18 21:53:53
Not really. All you need is a market that has a behavior. Which, so far, Bitcoin does... The spikes and "crashes" started with smaller frequency (more spaced apart, and of smaller volume) and are increasing exponentially over time. It's a trend that's already a part of the Bitcoin price action and you can clearly see it by looking at a lifetime chart.
Also worth noting is the sizes of the "crashes" seem to be decreasing over time. Believe it or not, the previous "crash" had a smaller % draw-down than the first, second or third "crashes," all of which were smaller than the previous.
@_date: 2013-11-08 20:49:32

That's what I'm saying, even established business owners would need to remove themselves from that kind of a system, realizing it will eat into their profits as well as their customer base. A government that creates policy that hurts EVERYONE (businesses and consumers) is not making wise moves. Ideally, government wouldn't hurt anyone (businesses or consumers).
This kind of a system is way too controlled and regulated for such an awesome currency. It takes a lion and trains it to do circus tricks when it was born to hunt wild gazelle and lounge in the serengeti. 
Are you saying this is the US government or a global government? Because I really doubt the world is going to take US controlling all the Bitcoin lightly..

He's trying to change the face of MATH itself to pin a negative light on Bitcoin. Eesh.
The DOLLAR inflates because we make MORE of it. It wouldn't inflate if all we did was DIVIDE it. We're not making more Bitcoin, we're simply dividing it. A single Bitcoin's value remains the same, regardless of how much you wish to divide it.

Hey don't down yourself. You're probably very intelligent, just new to the Bitcoin world. Everyone starts out new to BTC. But the BTC community is very enthusiastic about new people coming in!
To answer your question, yes... and no. You'll need to be sure your bank is tied to both. Or at least SOME kind of account where cash can be wired to the exchanges. Otherwise, you'll sit there buying bitcoin and transferring but it won't turn into fiat again (which isn't really a problem). But if you're attempting to turn a (fiat) profit on your Bitcoin, you'll want to have that bank ability...
(By the way, I hope I haven't confused you... I do not want to give the assumption that the "way bitcoin works" is by using arbitrage. Lol. That's just a little side thought I had... I tend to rabbit trail)
So here's how it works, arbitrage excluded. Get an account at your desired exchange. Wire them some money (enough to buy the quantity of bitcoin you want at the current price). Buy bitcoin. You could also go to   (where I bought my first 2 BTC) or mine them. But that's a whole other can of worms.
There are many places to buy them. 
Once you're familiar with Bitcoin and using them, THEN the fun can start with exchange arbitrage. If you want to buy bitcoin worth $369 at one exchange, you can do so, by only paying $326 at another exchange, then transfer them over to the exchange with the higher rate. So yes: instant profit. Then cash out, rinse and repeat. Eventually you'll be building a bitcoin stash just from doing this, and it won't cost a thing after a while. You'd be doing it on pure profit.

Sure, but right now it's not... I don't mean cashing it all out. But taking out only what you need in fiat and keeping the rest in BTC. Bills, rent, things that can't (yet) be purchased with BTC. I do enjoy watching Bitcoin go up in value against fiat though.

You're not really holding your money on your computer... the "money" is in the Block Chain. Your Wallet (wallet.dat file in your computer) is what stores the information that tells the block chain how much Bitcoin your specific "person" holds and can use/sell.
Biggest wallets I'd have to say come from [Bitcoin.org]( itself, which includes Bitcoind/Bitcoin-QT and Multibit as the first majors (most trusted), there is also Armory, a wallet and security mechanism for managing your Bitcoin bounty.
The way it works is, you fire up your desired Bitcoin client (wallet software) for the first time, it generates a wallet.dat file with a 100% unique wallet "address" you can now designate to be the destination/source of future Bitcoin acquisitions and expenditures.
As far as the TECH side, like HOW it all works, bro, I'm clueless. Cryptography is a language I am looking to learn. It is going to be necessary in the near and distant future.

Question.. as I'm still trying to learn this stuff myself. Can someone who installs a "password reader"/"keystroke recorder" on a host computer still attain that information if a computer is disconnected from the internet temporarily while password stuff is being executed? Or does a program like that send information only on live connections in real time? (limiting its ability to actually steal your password)
@_date: 2013-11-10 20:04:30
Doing so would de-value it, and a new currency would come as a result. What we're going to learn with the rise of Bitcoin is that now, if we (the 99%) don't like something, we can use something else. This creates a majority power over minorities wishing to have all the power.
In essence, if what you suggest actually happened, Bitcoin would be today's Dollar, and (perhaps) Litecoin would be today's Bitcoin.

These things have already been taken into account at places like LocalBitcoins.com and CoinBase, where, once you place an order, it locks in the price you ordered at, until you receive them. 
You are right about the value of Bitcoin fluctuating. It always will.  But you'll never receive "less bitcoins" than you purchased. If you purchase 2 BTC, you'll receive 2 BTC.

If you have a backup of your wallet.dat file (the file that makes your computer more valuable than when you bought it), as long as you encrypted the backup with password protection, you should have enough time to transfer it to a different wallet. So if the thief DOES happen to crack your wallet's private key, when they load up the block chain, your wallet has already sent the Bitcoin and they now have zero.

It's not an excuse for Bitcoin's performance, it's an explanation for Bitcoin's performance. Bitcoin is inherently viral. It can also be invested in. Looking at two of the most viral companies in web history, I believe, can give us insight into what is fueling this growth: which I propose, is simply, Bitcoin going viral.
That's all I'm saying.
Again, I must say, this post was NOT to compare volatility. It was to compare growth and adoption.
@_date: 2013-11-08 20:57:49

@_date: 2013-11-13 17:47:15
I think you're really just overthinking it. Though most of what you're saying is true to an extent, it's really not this bad. You're in Reddit. Which is a community in and of itself and does not include everyone in the entirety of Bitcoin adoption. While I agree, there are a lot of people over-emphasizing the potential and under-acknowledging the risk, I also feel it can be seen the other way around. There are an awful lot of people over-emphasizing the risk while under-acknowledging the potential for something truly amazing. There's a balance. Not every view is going to be balanced. My best suggestion here is to just form your own balanced view of Bitcoin and make your own decision. Everyone is going to have their own reasons and philosophies, theories, etc. on why they decide (not) to take the leap into Bitcoin. Some unfortunately, will make the decision solely based on something they read of Reddit. In which case, maybe they deserve to potentially lose their investment for such poor research and analysis. For me, it's something where I'd rather invest a few $k right now and lose it all, than invest nothing and see it skyrocket.
This, alongside some thorough research, has brought me to where I am now: a proud owner of a handful of Bitcoin. :)
Best of success to you on whatever you choose and know that your decision is the decision that is right - for YOU. Not necessarily everyone.

1. Yes.

2. Yes/No. This is called trading. You can stand to gain or lose great sums of money doing this.
3. That's really up to you. But I say, the more the merrier.
4. I'd hold off on that unless you can drop 5 figs ($xx,xxx) on a good machine.
5.  
6. $0.05 isn't going to buy you much BTC. And CoinBase may have a minimum purchase amount. But worth a shot I suppose. There is no "main" site for Bitcoin (in terms of buying/selling). You can use localbitcoins.com, coinbase.com, btcquick.com, coinmama.com and many other alternatives.

@_date: 2013-11-11 00:56:29
It's confusing at first, but immerse yourself and you'll learn fast. The concept is easy once you get it.
The idea is getting into bitcoin without a huge portion of your motives being to keep the value of your fiat, and isntead, to participate in Bitcoin. The value will fluctuate, yes. But the nature of its protocol is built to grow.
"Getting in" now is a great time to do so! It's still worth pennies on a grand scheme. Just as you wouldn't be concerned with a fluctuation between 1 and 4 cents, I wouldn't be too concerned right now with a fluctuation between $100 and $400.
What if only 50% of the world adopted Bitcoin? That's like 3.5 billion people. If the entire bitcoin economy was running on this 3.5 billion people, each person could have 0.006 Bitcoin if evenly distributed (for now, we'll assume it is evenly distributed, for the sake of simplicity).
Now consider that each person had a net worth of $10,000 (fiat) to keep it conservative and somewhat average, and that over time, this fiat was turned into Bitcoin (which is what you're seeing now with price fluctuation - it's the transfer of fiat to Bitcoin)
$10,000 = 0.006 BTC.
Which means:
1 BTC = $1.7 Million
One day, Bitcoin won't have a fiat to transfer to. And the training wheels (fiat) that got Bitcoin to the price level it was at will be removed. Bitcoin will then assume a constant value (when 21 million have been mined), if fiat does indeed disappear. 
But guess what? Supply &amp; demand also dictate the value of Bitcoin. As more people are born into this world, the value will continue to grow. Slowly, sure. But it will.
@_date: 2013-11-08 23:51:05
Interesting... So I see that current computing power of the BTC Network is at 47,547.18 PetaFLOPs.. (47,547.18 x 10^15 FLOPS)...  I do know that in June of this year, China built a supercomputer called the Tianhe-2 with 30.65 PetaFLOPs.. (30.65 x 10^15 FLOPs) and required the equivalent of $390 Million USD to build (2.4 Billion Yuan). That's .06% of the BTC network computing power. In order to have a 51% edge on the entire network, we'd need a network/supercomputer capable of at least 24,249.06 PetaFLOPs currently... Such a network, at the same costs of the Tianhe-2, would require at least 791.16 x $390 Million USD.
I do understand all this is possible, in various forms. It doesn't necessarily need an evil doctor to drop billions of dollars on a super computer to get it going. But at the same time, I just don't see it happening... Maybe I'm misunderstanding the nature of a 51% attack, but right now it doesn't look likely. Plausible, yes. Likely? I honestly can't confidently say yes.
*edit - added parenthesis for less clutter.

Bitcoin is also currency, not an index (as the S&amp;P500 is). It also has many applications. Its growth can be compared to a viral website. S&amp;P500 index was only used by investors, stock traders and institutions. Bitcoin is a useful tool for everyone. Its growth will be viral and is expected to be parabolic as word of mouth spreads. Sure, it may fizzle. There's always that possibility. And my personal stupid opinion is one that says Bitcoin has gone past the point of no return.
What's your stupid opinion? :D
