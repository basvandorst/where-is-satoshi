This is the longest candle ever happened to bitcoin actually! And such unpredictable...
@_date: 2019-07-19 20:00:24
There always will be shorts. maybe on different level though.
@_date: 2019-07-05 09:26:38
That is illegal.
@_date: 2019-07-02 21:17:10
Because Bitcoin became store of value and gold equivalent in digital world. Which is a bit wrong... but that is another discussion.
@_date: 2019-07-14 09:38:51
Because term Market Cap mostly used by crypto-community and relatives. Actual stock market use CAPITALIZATION, that is why it show crypto results. Market Cap is legit term for both though.

He as a 45-th president of US what did you expect? He ought to praise national currency, if he'd say "I am fan of bitcoin" imagine shock of government? Imagine people reaction? Imagine stock market?

@_date: 2019-08-20 08:49:41
Okay. You are right. I am asking wrong question. But let me try last time to explain. I believe that someday BTC will be widely adopted, and as of the moment it happen, PP will be useless, right? There is no point for PP to exist in a world where BTC is better in any possible way, for making payments, transfers, maintain security and privacy and so on. So if we agreed on that, then how far BTC from taking over PP?. I mean, there is a certain point, where balance inclined and point where it like 50/50. You got me?
@_date: 2019-08-20 07:53:27
It makes total sense. How many payments going thru PP compare to BTC, how many daily users it has and so on.
@_date: 2019-08-13 14:04:00

Okay them explain me current price of bitcoin. I mean, housing market backed by investment banks and mortgages and property. I can understand 300 square meters house cost of half of a million dollar, because there is a market and many people can buy that house, the house represent some area, land on which it build, schools around, community.., whereas bitcoin is worth nothing and 10k at the same time... The main question is why... I mean, you could say "because someone would pay 10k for bitcoin" which is not enough.

@_date: 2019-08-20 08:25:21
I got your point. 
Let's put it that way. PP is not a currency, and bitcoin is not a payment processor, but people can use both PP and BTC for their need, as customers let's say, what I am asking is, where is Bitcoin at this point compare to PP? How preferable, how many people use BTC to buy some stuff, rather than PP and vice versa.

Okay, funny. **But seriously**, because of this kind posts we have so many "BITCOIN ITS A SCAM!!!, PYRAMIDE, PONZI!" and I totally understand those who saying that, because there is no scheme to get rich, if someone is saying that there is, and you should invest, probably they just want your money.

Actually socialist government is more like bitcoin, the government itself, all property, all power belong to people, to all people and at the same time to no one. There was no credit card, there was no mortgage, no commercial banks. The planned governments do WORK, and it is soo good, I mean, if you go deep in to that structure of society and government combination, you find out how perfect it is, this is again like bitcoin, self-regulated closed-circle system. Government knew what people need, so government provide best for people needs, it fills what is really necessary, for example - Free healthcare, social benefits such as free transportation, free education, free tourism, free recreation sites, free homes, free property, free cloths, work for everyone. See, people have needs, they always will, and  SOCIALIST government made up as easy and as fast and as good as possible for SOCIETY, it is not like private business that exploits people's demand in every way, and fill it with overpriced crap that'll eventually crack or be thrown for new one. This is not private businesses that exploit people themselves as slaves, to increase revenue, to avoid paying more penny to worker, it is not like those corporation brainwash workers in avoiding working unions for better environment. Soviet government for example encourage people to create work-unions(communes)! See it is kind a different goal, in capitalism there is always a capital as a goal, and people as a tool. but in socialists governments it is PEOPLE goal, and capital is a tool! There is soo much to to discuss actually. I will tell you the last example of approach - The waste. In soviet union's planned economy, was an idea, to unify containers for beverage, jam, sausage. etc. There was 8 types of glass containers(for all UNION! Which is by the way was second world's economy, 320+ millions of people and largest territory in the world), so point is, you don't throw it away, you reuse it, again and again. you don't need to deal with plastic, you don't poison earth, instead, you unify it! And even better, people could deliver their used bottles of milk to shop for money! So any local grocery got a truck(or few) with milk bottles everyday, and everyday that truck took empty bottles back to  LOCAL farm\\factory(which is also was an employer for people around), so now imagine this, in US? Not only all milk producers competing with each other, and never agree on unified container, not only they aren't local producers, they also trying to make milk as much lasting as possible by add chemicals and so one, all for revenue. it is cost people's health by the way! And here you go, healthcare, private clinics and hospitals. A lot of discussions going on, talking shit about plastic straws to get rid of to save planet. Think about it. Also, most of private companies all monopolized in US, they it is kind a planning economy in micro governments all the way, but they aren't plan it for your interest, they doing it for their revenue and bonuses.

Um... people of high moral principles were living in USSR I can tell ya, and all of a sudden they became animals, when it comes to - MONEY.  I can not imagine anything more totalitarian than current United States state. There is plenty of arguments on both sides though.
@_date: 2019-09-30 07:58:02
The reason why this isn't a big deal is that bitcoin has soo low impact due to it small(compare to stock market) volume and market cap. The more it grow, the hard to swallow -80% pill be.

I am still wondering how did bitcoin made it from 3k to 13k...
@_date: 2019-09-03 14:03:29
Do you understand why? Because there was bi-polar world before, and US government was competing with USSR, they couldn't afford such juvenile behavior, once other empire fall, there is nothing to do anymore, no one to compete with, no point to make up image of free society and happy life for everyone... got it? And who could even imagine socialistic or democratic-socialist to rise up in 21 century in US, but they actually are!
