I don’t care how many down votes I get, the fact &amp; truth is, I made a transfer yesterday from an exchange to my wallet. Took 2 minutes. 2 minutes people. And that was for Bitcoin Cash. BCH.

Well here is where game theory comes in. Less Chinese miners, means hashrate difficulty reduces (maybe by 20%) what this would do is incentivize anybody &amp; everybody else to start mining, as the block rewards are easier to find.

Still it's A LOT better that any, any Fiat currency, even in its current form, which is in Beta stage in my opinion. Time is on Crypto-Currency's side.

No, you have a history in common before the forks, then the Merkel tree got modified, each with its own tree. Each block in the blockchain refers to the hash of the previous block. This won’t work, cause each hash of the current block of each blockchain is different.
