Sounds great, thanks. But unfortunately I don't have IOS, I've an Android phone.... :( 
I figured that there ought to be such a service so it's nice to know that there is.

I see. But I got money on my paypal account, which I can transfer to an exchange deposit, if any of them got the option to have cash deposit, and then I can use that cash deposit and buy bitcoin, and then transfer the bitcoin to my wallet. I wondered is there is such an exchange. I don't want to go through all the haszzle most places, identification process etc.

Well, I don't live in the US. I'm in Scandinavia. But thanks anyway.

I don't think it will be carried through though. It funny the minister of Justice who made the proposal was in the news, and when asked about it, he said that they did not intend to take peoples personal jewelry etc. but "if a guy came with a suitcase full of diamonds, that he would pay" then the news journalist ask him about how likely it would be that somebody would come with a suitcase full of diamonds! 
But obviously the vast majority of us Danes feel extremely disgusted and embarrased by this crazy proposal. When I first heard about it I was sure it was a joke.

Can I upload a picture to this subreddit, or send it to your Reddit inbox, or do I have to setup an account on Imgur, and then send a link?
@_date: 2016-01-02 22:46:15
Here you go:

Yeah, like a turtorial of how to use the Bittrex site, like buy, sell, bitcoins/altcoins, explain the different concepts of "ask" "last" etc. how to setup an account, how to withdraw funds etc.

Okay, I think I figured it out. Check this out:

Okay, I've set up an account on Imgur, and put up the picture/screen shot which give the whole thing some context.
@_date: 2016-01-14 12:10:12
Nope, you got a point there.
@_date: 2016-01-13 23:04:24
Thank you. I'm glad you find it interesting. I think I'll use Bitstamp exclusively now, and give up on Coinbase. 
@_date: 2016-01-02 21:57:56
Is Richie one of the co-founders of Bittrex?
@_date: 2016-01-14 12:09:58
I don't know! And since most bitcoin exchanges are not on the list, there is surely no need to get user data from Paypal to operate an exchange. 
@_date: 2016-01-03 11:21:52
@_date: 2016-01-03 00:23:10
Okay. I'll try to figure that out tomorrow. I'm completely new to Imgur. How do I add meme? Or mayube I'll figure it out, when I check it out tomorrow. Cheers.

But if you use the ordinary Bitcoin wallet for Android and you lose your phone, you also lose your Bitcoin, right?

Who are the 11 other countries?

Alright, so I have to move the file from my phone to my laptop, in order to be able to restore it? Can't I just make it connecte with Electrum or something. I guess I've a lot to read up on.
@_date: 2015-11-06 10:32:16
Gotta, thanks.

Thanks for your reply. Why do you go with Coinbase? Just because it is the most used? Or are the some specific pros over for instance Bitstamp? I've read that they have pretty good security, I gues that plays a role.
Thanks to point out that mSigna is the most complicated. I can't find any proper Youtube reviews of the wallet, so it's helpful. I'll probably prefer Electrum or MultiBit HD - I could of course install all three, and try to transfer Bitcoin with them etc. but nice to weed out in the options before going in depth with them.
I guess you got a good point about, opting for the Ledger wallet, and luckily it seems much more straight forward than Trezor for a newbie like me.

But can you tell me. When I try to transfer Bitcoin, like just a couple of Satoshi, it seems like I can't on the Mycelium. Is there a lower limit for how much Bitcoin one can transfer/send? I then chose the option of sending all the Satoshi I had in the Mycelium wallet to another wallet and it work fined. So what can be the problem?
@_date: 2015-11-01 21:04:26
Thank you. I didn't know. I guess I might delete this question then.
@_date: 2015-11-05 22:32:11
I use Mycelium as well. But I am right about that you're not able to recover your Bitcoins if you use the ordinary Bitcoin app for Android, and your phone is lost right?
@_date: 2015-10-11 20:49:57
I dunno. I was just wondering whenever such a lottery exists.
@_date: 2015-10-26 10:52:12
Thanks. Good points. So you use only Mycelium, or both?
@_date: 2015-10-15 22:46:48
Thanks.  I just watched it.  Very interesting.  
@_date: 2015-10-16 05:53:07
Okay thanks.  I'll try it out.  
@_date: 2015-10-15 22:51:41
So you would recommend another wallet?
@_date: 2015-11-05 22:33:05
Okay, thanks.
