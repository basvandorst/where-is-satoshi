Hello, thanks for mentioning our app:)
I know that widget in Bitcoin Checker can be designed in more pretty-looking way, but ours is more complicated (list of items instead of one item, you need to have a name of exchange etc.) Developing a widget is a tricky part because every user want it to fits his homescreen and all homescreens are different:) This is the reason why we've added some customization to our Widget - you can for example make it transparent or dark themed if you think it will look better on your dark homescreen:) By the way you can also remove the "ActionBar" from Widget or make items smaller (in height) by selecting a "compact mode":) But Widget in Bitcoin Checker is only as an "addition", other features like rich notifications, multiple alarms and customizable voice announcements are the strongest part of this app and we try to continuously improve it by adding new featured suggested by our users:)
As an Android and Crypto currencies enthusiast I think it's always better for users to have more applications in this subject. Every new app forces other to improve themselves:)
Bitcoin Checker is also free and without any ads. I'm developing it in my free time after my regular job. Thing that motivates us the most is when users are happy about using Bitcoin Checker:) So if you love developing for Android you should definitely go on with creating your app, any new experience is a great thing for a developer. Also: every app if designed with different goal in mind so every app will find users that will prefer particular one to other:)
Greetings!
