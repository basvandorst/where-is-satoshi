Still gotta open and close the channel.  250,000 channels per day isn't enough for 7 billion people.

This made me laugh because bitcoin is going to be an altcoin soon.

Unfortunately 360,000 humans are born each day.  Unless you want 2/3 state channel per lifetime current bitcoin capacity is not enough.

Never said you would close it immediately.  You could have it open for months and your network capacity still wouldn't be nearly enough to support 7 billion people transacting regularly.

1/17 millionth of all gold is worth like 500 thousand dollars.  Also, one enron stock is worth 3 cunt hairs.

The truth is both subreddits have their heads so far up their own ass they think they can see the future.  It's nearly impossible to find any useful information in either.  Nice price update features on both subreddits though!

Can't imagine the threads when your shitcoin becomes an altcoin.
