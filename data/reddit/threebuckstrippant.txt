I have BitCoin and doubled my money, but yet to find the old wallet. Trying to get enough together to use a recovery service for each drive from 2010-2012. It will be very expensive. 
A friend also warned me about recovery service people, so I need to use a fully reputable one.

You also took the same attitude you hater. Accusing someone of lies who is being truthful.

Haul of 25 disks so far are in a clean room in my house and offline Linux up and going. (The room is not messy).  One disk stands out as Hitachi 500Gb 2010 April “Clicking” written on it. Others are 2007 2013 and so on. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 18:07:40
No, no pools. It ran on my machine and I watched it say all kinds of things I couldn’t decipher back then. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 17:48:03
Oh yeah!!! Hahahah. Peer to peer bro.
@_date: 2017-10-10 17:27:42
Yes! All I need is my actual key back then right? 
@_date: 2017-10-11 15:27:00
So leave my thread alone, f off and block me you twadfuck. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:12:53
I’ve got the first 25 disks and I haven’t even searched or gone through everything in my office and storage. 
This “clicking”  Apr 2010 drive had me excited.  Also added a photo for you all as some people are jealous and doubting me.

Static or “clean room” requirements? My room is super clean but even a spec of dust messes it right? 
@_date: 2017-10-10 12:45:15
Absolutely man, my goal’s not getting cash. I just love the fact this happened and for some reason I had the early adopter mindset back then to try. And no idea why I keep all my disks. I just love legacy computing coming from starting on a Vic20.  100% man. Thank you. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 09:50:00
Wow, excellent, Thank you. All the drives are disconnected from PC's as I upgraded over the years. Some however I fear may not work. Old drives often had clicks and so on. Still excited though, I mean from a work perspective not the fact it is worth something.

I think we can use IT to predict the demographic, location, hobbies and even the job of guys who may do it. For example everyone who played Second Life may be this kinda dude. And then narrow that down and buy their machines. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 17:28:30
Shiester, what do you mean? I dont get this...
@_date: 2017-10-10 18:16:44
Ohhhhh, does this hinder finding them ever again. If I have many old drives and actually Mined back in 2010. Like even if I find the Wallet... do I need the password? 
@_date: 2017-10-10 18:09:36
Thank you. Hopefully no, but let me know if not. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 17:26:47
Hahahha, lovely Social hacking right there. I believe you Mr Umbudu. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 19:35:03
OMG I had no idea. Holy wow, I was expecting 1 or 10 but you’re saying if I just solved one it was actually 50, so in todays valuation that’s like $250k ... speechless. OK this just went next level, potentially there are actual Millions sitting on a shitty disk somewhere, or not ! Man :(    100% I was mining alone at that time. Some clunky ass Windows software it was, I was highly unimpressed at the time. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 17:33:54
Funny dude, but I own my IT company so.... I’m not THAT dumb.
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:37:54
@_date: 2017-10-10 09:38:17
Thanks Hazamattaz. There are at least 40 or 50 drives and I am doing 1 at a time all offline on my own. Triangulation backups were always my motto.
@_date: 2017-10-10 17:40:33
Thanks Bro! Already am
@_date: 2017-10-10 17:47:41
Well over more than ten years. I registered my first domain in 1998 and then started Ecommerce. I never wanted to throw any drives ever so for sure it works out about that until now. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 18:06:26
The only difference was I actually started the software running and had pretty good Gaming stuff going. Was not that interested as it was kinda pointless not being able to buy stuff and being like less than $10 when we were making real money in real business. NOW, this is just totally and awesome fact and something for me to do! 
@_date: 2017-10-10 18:03:29
My ICO work is ICO as a Service! System, Design, Web and translation so not the actual investment from me. And by the way not all of these are scams actually, as the block chain WILL rule the world and the internet within ten years or less. So a loooooot of the ICOs now you mock will be the future of the world. Guaranteed mate. 
Anyway, if this turns out to be a windfall, I will just do another business with it or something. Retirement is for people who are lost and bored with no ideas and no motivation to change the world. I retired at 32 for two years and it was the most boring thing EVER, highly overrated. I then started more businesses and it saved me. Cheers Mr Office. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 19:33:02
Thank You. I will do. Getting awesome advice, I would never have done all this. 
@_date: 2017-10-11 02:08:34
Excellent advice, Thank You.
@_date: 2017-10-10 17:26:08
Many many hard disks and I don’t know which one. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 17:43:53
OK Thank you. That sounds a long way down the line tho. Will ask again if found. Cheers
@_date: 2017-10-10 18:08:48
You have your whole life to sort that. Take it easy man. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 17:55:02
Loving this level of depth. Thank You.
@_date: 2017-10-10 19:31:52
Perfect starting point. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 08:01:21
This is it so far. 
Ubuntu 17, USB to SATA and 1Tb WD Passport (which is exFAT). I think I need to get different formatted destination disk.

Well, yeah ... but I didn’t keep it running for years. Since this currency is Virtual, everyone could get some. Let’s see, but I dont wanna hype this up and fail. Just want advice in THE BEST WAY to not fuck this up.
@_date: 2017-10-11 14:59:54
Happy this happened. But I see why you’re a dicktwad now. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 17:23:26
OK, already this is awesome. Reddit has a remind me bot... Jesus. Dont worry, tomorrow I’m getting the first disks up. 
@_date: 2017-10-11 15:22:37
Hahahahaa.... Millenial I presume? 
@_date: 2017-10-10 10:24:25
Should I use Linux to do all this? All the drives were Windows at the time. Now I’m fine on Linux. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 13:56:49
Heard of ... I never said that, of course I followed it. But I started my IT company a couple years after and it went ballistic so forgot about it all. Especially since it was like $10 each. Now it’s $5000 and I am getting ICO work it has become relevant and I started mining Ether which jogged my memory of the weeks mining Bitcoin years ago. Eh...
@_date: 2017-10-10 10:19:02
Yes! Thank You. I am even interested in getting at the platters for completely dead drives. Though I may be dreaming. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 10:18:00
Thank You Puff the Magic Dragon, I hear your flames. I am sure there's more than one coin, could be hundreds. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 17:34:24
Nope matey, you wish... My drive collection will drop tomorrow on here. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 10:51:49
Thanks Mr Jens!! But I think this is gonna take months. I’m already pretty fine financially so this is more of a game for me. I’m 100% sure I have Solveds back then. How many, I dont know.
