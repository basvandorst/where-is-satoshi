Buyer protection isnt free to them. Hence the fees.
I'm not saying 10% is fair, but there has to be some fee associated with it.

I mean, dragon coins sound super legit so, yeah, I could see this fooling just about anyone.
@_date: 2018-08-19 23:51:53
This is NOT true.

I have done this countless times over many years without an audit.

What's in that yogurt container?

Yeah, I ran away from yahoo when gmail came to limited public beta. I always feared they would go under and the email would go with it.

You said you will be audited if you get a deposit over 10k. I was saying that is not correct. Had you said that it makes you possibly audited, I would have agreed.

I think the Starter jacket zipper was well before this symbol. We collected those in the early 90's.

So? What's going to happen? Nothing.

I traded all my BTC to an alt yesterday. This is why BTC moons.

Sometimes I'd appreciate a little privacy. Do you have to make a post about each time I pay my water bill?

The market always reacts opposite of what CNBC says. Incoming dip.

I think the important bit here is a lot of money was spent on gear back then and none of it has value today.
If they were to charge money for an email address and you were thinking it will be valuable in the future because everyone will want to use email, obviously you'd be right but wrong as all these new products emerged year after year.

What about after an EMP?
@_date: 2019-04-22 17:33:13
I have had power out to my town for 9 days before. Life went on. EMPs cabe local to, maybe only affecting a town or several towns. It doesnt have to be a national disaster.

There are stable value 401k plans usually that net low returns but rarely ever drop.
@_date: 2019-01-05 13:00:05

The price is on the billboard. $1.39

It is actually pretty good now.

That puzzle piece slide is tricky. Sometimes I fail it. I can see how this would stop a hacker who doesnt have the same sliding skills as non hackers.
