I can make 1Btc disappear in a matter of hours. So can you. 
It's called Dogecoin.

You lose some, you win... a lot.
I definitely like the second payment method you described, but not sure how this would work. What is profit if I sell BTC for LTC, and then LTC for QRK, and so on..
Perhaps a better way would be to hand it out for free, and add a small additional fee using for the software. That way you cover all the load that comes in from different types of transactions in a responsible way.

It's 4 AM here and I'm watching the charts. I want to go to sleep so bad but I'm afraid I miss a good chance to buy back.

Man, tonight is awesome. Just be patient and buy back once there's a chance.

I have no idea what you guys are talking about.

You're missing the point. It's not about banks as a businessmodel, it's about wealth creation. Find me one example in modern history where banks shared their monopoly in this regard. You can't. Financial organizations have a ruthless reputation when it comes to protecting this particular power.

I wish I could lock myself out of my wallet sometimes.

Basicly what Bitcoin does it put banks out of business. We have not yet seen 1% of the shitstorm that will get unleashed once it grows bigger. In order to grow, there has to be a heavy clash between Bitcoin and the banks (governments) in the future. Dont think they'll just give up or 'play ball' once it's due.

Man, I dont even know how I ended up here.   
Please tell me everything is going to be just fine.

BTC's value depends on it's practical use as a currency. 
Once everyone decides to look at it as a commodity rather then a form of transaction, it will 'fail'.    
    
Let's say Starbucks accepts BTC's tomorrow but nobody is willling to spend their coins for coffee. They rather sit on it and wait for it to grow it's value.
     
Next thing you know, other businesses will look at Starbucks and say; 'Forget BTC, implementing costs money and people dont actually spend their coins'. 
    
So we fast forward in time, and right about now no business chooses to trade in BTC's.
What does this mean for that stacked wallet of yours, what is 1 BTC worth now? A $1000,-? Maybe $1,-? WHAT DOES IT BUY?
    
Absolutely nothing. Well maybe a 'bitcointip'. 
I think the big expectations come from the fact that BTC has only reached the tip of the iceberg when it comes to integrating existing economies and/or building it's own. The total marketcap is currently at 12 billion.
Now imagine that Apple decides to accept BTC's for their Iphones. Now that market alone tripple's the size of the current marketplace. More goods you can choose to spend you BTC for means a higher value. In this particular scenario the price of 1BTC would skyrocket.  
Feel free to correct me guys.
