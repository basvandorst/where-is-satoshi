Of course, spend on your budget unless you like to gamble. Someone with more income than you can spend $200 every paycheck; and someone with less $5, it's basic money management that adults should know by now.

There are few real business men here. If you are serious about the future of bitcoin then you would know the more Bitcoin users the better, the rude trolls on this sub reddit don't have a business foundation, they treat this like a game

It doesnt take paper wallets?? damn that is terrible.. if its not on a paper wallet then I wont trust it.. too much bullshit been happening lately, not putting your big investment into paper wallets seems like huge simple mistake to me.

I've been to the bitcoin center by wallstreet a few times. Plenty of computer science bros and some professional suite wearing investors in there; can't really judge a book by its cover, everyone is unique. you will get schooled if you walk in there not knowing some bitcoin fundamentals. Bitcoin is building its own future, you can either help or get out of the way honestly

cognitive dissonance: Mental conflict that occurs when beliefs or assumptions are contradicted by new information. 
So whats the new information? that gox was a ponzi scheme? To me thats not new, most smart people could see that gox was a sinking ship. Right now nothing is contradicting my assumption that bitcoin has the potential of becoming a new alternative global currency system.

My post was referring directly to the people who are saying bitcoin will fail because of GOX PULLING OUT AND THE PRICE DROPPING. Somehow my post emotionally affected you, you started insulting me right away, and I don't give a shit.. I think you need to read my post again so you can see I am referring to trolls dick-riding a price drop, I am NOT talking about ALL bitcoin skeptics! you fucking idiot :). 
You cant see through me, you have no idea how many bitcoins I bought/sold/used.. Did I ever say bitcoin is a get-rich-quick scheme??  Its an online currency system not  a scheme, have you done any research? Yes money can be made by holding onto bitcoins and selling at a high price but that is not the point of cryptocurrency, you are mixing up facts with shitty assumptions. If I buy a brick of gold, does that mean I am supporting a get rich quick scheme and I am ruining the whole banking system?? come on bro how old are you?
Ive met people who are selling and buying bitcoins as a fulltime job! This is bigger than your small brain can comprehend. You need to reevaluation your argument bro, you love to jump to conclusions based on your emotions and stupid assumptions. 
Go fuck yourself kid

While kids are being slaughtered in Palestine with our tax money the media focuses the attention on the ice bucket challenge. Its the new planking, its a fun viral thing to do while ignoring genocide and the fucked up shit thats currently happening like cops shooting a black teen 6 times and people rioting. 
Its nice to donate for a good cause but when you have civilians currently being killed with money funded from our fuckin pockets, these challenges seem really ignorant... I'm just saying

@_date: 2014-02-16 22:16:30
Yeah I guess I miss-worded my title. The point I am trying to make is that this money transfer app has been around for 2 years on the apple market place; apple now decides to attack bitcoin apps while this Venmo app is being heavily advertised (I havent seen one bitcoin billboard anywhere, Venmo adds are all over NY). 
Venmo has been around for 2 years but only until recently its being advertised like its the next big thing.. 
If I am the only one that sees this connection I guess I am just being paranoid.

I agree with you, r/bitcoin needs to be more friendly with skeptics because all of us are skeptics. To me its real world value is unknown until regulations are clearly established, until then it will continue being a roller coaster.

I called it Apples shitty version because Apple supports it. If Apple banned facebook apps from all apple devices and some third party app named Bookface came out with no criticism from apple, would I be wrong to say its like apple's version of facebook?

I suggest you get a smaller amount asap incase the price continue to climb so that you can benefit.  Once you feel confident buy the rest of the Bitcoin you wanted. I am assuming this is for long term investment

The site needs a lot of work which I am in the process of doing. I would also like to make a site catering to children and another for the elderly.

Never mind it came through, thanks!
@_date: 2014-02-27 16:52:50
But to the average person who doesn't know shit about bitcoin, a price drop = bitcoin failing. I completely agree with what you are saying though.
@_date: 2014-03-04 16:21:56
So even after the whole mt gox fiasco people still arent using paper wallets? I am assuming a paper wallet is too difficult for the average user to understand hence shit like this happens. 
@_date: 2014-07-25 21:18:44
So is it never too late for regulation? From my understanding if they had the technology to regulation a decentralized entity they would have done so with Bittorent, it boggles my mind. What ever they do I hope its simple and automatic

There are 26 resorts in the Area, their names are listed here: 
lift ticket is about $98 per day for adults: 
I contacted skibig3.com customer support about the amount of snow: "Sure, so Lake Louise and Sunshine Village have around a 110cm base and 47cm for Norquay. We haven't had a lot of consistent snowfall over the past few weeks however over the past few days each ski resort have received an average of 11cm fresh snow daily. There is snow in the forecast over the coming days
Considering this, conditions are really good for early season"

I am not sure if I am making myself clear, I apologize. Bitcoin and dogecoins can both be tipped and divided infinitely.
what makes one more fun then the other? I can do waaay more things with Bitcoin than dogecoin so to me Bitcoin is more fun. This doesnt have anything to do with being professional

The time needed to research what dogecoin is = time needed to research what bitcoin is. 
I honestly dont see how it is easier to get into doge first then Bitcoin, maybe this was the case in the past but Bitcoin has become easier to obtain than before. I see the innovation on the Bitcoin side but not doge 
@_date: 2015-01-15 15:53:37
reminder, you can buy $1 of dogecoin, and you can also buy $1 of bitcoin. what really separates the two is the communities and app development.

People think in terms of value, value is a number too. Changetip tells you the dollar amount that you were tipped, regardless of which type of crypto.
a noob wont know the difference between .46btc and 676,773 doge, the value means the most to them.

Look at the reality of whats going on here. People are buying bitcoin and altcoins for the potential of future profit, think about how many people are sticking their Bitcoin in cold storage. Bitcoin being a medium of transfer of value is just one function of Bitcoin

I agree because its true. Bitcoin is the backbone bro
@_date: 2015-01-15 16:14:31
Its not about financial gain, its about extending the Bitcoin network and community globally and to not be divided because noobs think they are going to make a killing with alt coins. 
"exploiting circumstances for the purpose of financial gain is sophomoric at best" didnt you just say you made profit from selling mining machines and altcoins? If one of your mining machines was unprofitable but a noob wanted to buy it anyway because he doesnt understand the technicalities wouldnt you be exploiting him too?  
This is not as simple as coke vs pepsi and you must know this if you invested time and money into this technology.

"a ponzi scheme which as we all know is what bitcoins are"
you are the perfect example of the people I am talking about. If we all speculated that bitcoin was a ponzi scheme, why do most of us strongly support it??? Was mtgox a ponzi scheme? by definition, yeah. 
Is Bitcoin a ponzi scheme? by definition, no.  Bitcoin is a online currency system! example: If i started mining for platinum and create a currency system using platinum instead of gold, does that mean I run a ponzi scheme? do your research bro

Keep it if you want to gamble and see if it gains value on the long term. 
If you want to trade it for cash, go to localbitcoins.com, find someone who sells coins for cash. offer him your coins at 3% over market value, most traders wont turn that down.
