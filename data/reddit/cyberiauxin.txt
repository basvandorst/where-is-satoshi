It could become like the Esperanto of money.

I had another question to add to OP's post.  
Well, 2...  
1)  When you buy a HDW wallet, how do you buy it to not have much trace, if any, back to you?  
2)  If you're using a software wallet, like Samourai, and you get a HDW wallet.  What's the process for those transfers?

How should I buy these?  What's the best way to not have your identity attached to the purchase?

I ask this because I just put $125 in and I expect to be a millionaire by this time next year.

Can we get some MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA crossover?

I need it to dip a few more times so I can buy more.  I don't have enough yet.

It's gonna move more near Christmas, and when we get bigger into the recession we'll see it move.

Yeah, it doesn't even work on Reddit.

Thanks for this.  I really appreciate it.

I would bet you any money, that leading up to, and after the halvening, it's been orchestrated to make Bitcoin go down initially, not up.

I hate this argument.  When your influence becomes so pervasive in culture, you are then beholden to greater moral standards.

That name dooms it.

What amount of BTC would you say you'd need to have in order to make a personal node a necessity?  
I don't have a ton, and setting up a node seems like it might be pricey.
