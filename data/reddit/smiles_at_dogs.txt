Thanx for posting this. I think it is important to note that here and at the hearings a few weeks ago, they were addressing "virtual currencies", not just Bitcoin. To me this shows an understanding of the potential uses of the technology beyond a currency. The fact that he speaks of NY being the welcoming hub for btc/virtual currency businesses is going to affect the tone other cities throughout the US take toward btc. This is positive shit.
Yeah, we don't need them. But, they are going to find they're(regulators/govt/etc) way in not matter what. I take this as an admission to this tech being way ahead of their league and jurisdiction. And i guess he likes dogecoin. I can't blame him. The shibe's wear ya down until you roll over for a belly rub.
Everything to the moon!

Thanx man!

As intriguing as it is, this is fucked up. The guy wanted to be left alone. Be thankful for the gift of Bitcoin and have some respect. Has he not earned anyone's respect with this contribution? Assholes like this "journalist" are plenty of reason to desire anonymity.

I also agree. r/bitcoin is simultaneously informative and obnoxious. Far too often just obnoxious. Thank you for posting this.

I follow all updates on bitcointalk, reddit, havelock, and every where I can. The patience displayed in all posts by you or whoever else is communicating on behalf of the company is more reassuring to me than any picture. Just a small time investor here saying thanx and congrats on all you have accomplished so far. Very exciting!
@_date: 2014-07-03 14:40:42
yes, he did.

Thank You! I wish those people that are complaining abut the price had as wide a lens as you. Actually it is fascinating that somebody could be aware and participating in this technology and remain so short sighted. Very frustrating.

It does not matter.

Takes a lot of the mystique out of those mysterious bitcoin users. Unless "Sheets" is code for something illegal...

That is what I was thinking while reading the op's article. These diagrams above help visualize that thought. Also, Inception...

Yes, yes. I wholeheartedly agree. And it is not bad, just boring. If i had the choice between them and InBevAnhizerCoorsMolson corp (etc) I would go with Phila Brew Co. every time. But I do not seek it out. Good on them for getting into Bitcoin though!

Too bad their beer is mediocre at best. I want it to be good, I really do. I always give their new and seasonal stuff a try and even revisit their year round brews. But they are just blah.
And that is one of the stupidest excuses for an article I have ever read.

Wow, man. Apparently you read the article.

I often come here for news but wind up downvoting bitcoin memes, screen shots and gifs and then wondering why I bother coming here.
@_date: 2013-11-08 15:43:10
30, M, BS Mass Communication, unemployed. I have instructed snowboarding, worked with the homeless and taught English in Korea. Strongly considering a BS in comp sci or something. Need a job to buy more Bitcoin...and pay rent...but mostly buy more Bitcoin.
