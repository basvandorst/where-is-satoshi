what is the major flaw? didn't see any.
"PoW is PoS, but PoS is not PoW"-argument?
or the "immutability"-argument?
in my view, both PoS or PoW will suffer the subpoena argument (not immutable). "Here, miner, I'm the 3-letter-agency. If you want to continue your operations, disconsider all the transactions from the block or consider this chain as valid". Once it is on the blockchain, the work to change the past is the "same". And in some sense, the PoW is even worse, as the are fewer players.

i've counted already 11 out 12 that didn't signalized..
as we need at least 101 before the next difficulty, seems like today (and not in the next couple of days) we are going to fail in this attempt to activate segwit

We are in a democracy environment with many keys (as from the video) distributed along MANY players. 
IMHO, the Barry Silbert agreement is a try to "minimize" the numbers of keys, given the power to a few and, these few, take the power of bitcoin in a dictatorial manner.

I saw, the other people people putting it on the same "grade" as bitstamp
