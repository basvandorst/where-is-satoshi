Im using one called mercatorcoin. Never had a problem before in using it for over 6 months. So will I wait a few hours and see if it shows up in either wallet?

Just did a bit of research and my wallet uses electrum coinomi system if that helps

Done both and is still showing same thing that its been pruned from the node and rejected from database. Is it just a waiting game now?

I sent mines through my coin wallet and have no say in fees to be paid. Its set at .00001 and my transaction was .1 btc. Its still saying very high priority

Now onto day 3.5 and still not one confirmation. My send was 0.1 with a 0.001 fee attached which I have no control over changing. Hope it goes through soon I need the money for 2moro

Its a bitcoin wallet that can also let you exchange into different digital currencies. Its on my android tablet and has been awesome to use
