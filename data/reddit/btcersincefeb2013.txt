I'm not trying to be unreasonable or condescending. I know I suck at communication. But my point it valid. Maybe you can reword and resubmit it? We need a security audit, we need detailed answers, we need to know how and why 850,000btc were stolen. We need reassurance that the fault was with bad code on the exchange, and not with the blockchain or bitcoin     
please upvote

I wish you would reverse you downvote. Just so that this post can be seen. I am bringing up a valid concern, shared by many in the community. Please reverse your vote
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:27:20
Tell me about the code. How have you tested it? When did you determine that it was bug free? Please post your results!!! we need to see
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:30:20
Please make your own post explaining why we should trust bitcoin if an exchange was just robbed of 850,000btc. I will upvote you.

I don't need your instruction. I roll dice for my addresses.    
If we want our baby to grow up, it needs to be user friendly
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:39:33
no, that's not the question. We all know we shouldn't keep money on exchanges. That's what paper wallets, and cold wallets are for. The question is: HOW did someone steal 850,000 bitcoin from the oldest, largest exchange?    
Do we blame the exchange due to incompetency?    
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:59:05
That attitude is probably similar to the attitude of whoever allegedly stole the coins: "fuck all of you, I'm helping myself!"    
please upvote this post, and thread. so others can disagree with me too

We don't know any details. We only get info from unverifiable IRC logs and scribd documents, and tweets and etc     
We don't know anything. Mark K might have a US gag order. He might be blackmailed by the triads. He might be a dishonest swindler. He might have lost the private keys.     
We don't know.    
We have also heard, but don't know, that mtgox lost 850,000btc. HOW?    
We need answers, or cryptos will stagnate. No one who is informed is going to invest in cryptocurrency if we don't know EXACTLY why mtgox failed.

And it's fallen off of "new". so now it's gone. I'm not putting it on you, but I believe this is an issue that need to be presented to, and addressed by the community. Ignoring the reason that mtgox failed, is like before, when we ignored the issues with mtgox- it will not benefit our goals
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:52:15
you are indoctrinated, but you're just spitting out the defense. We need a security audit. If you like bitcoin, if you're a fan of cryptocurrency, you need to demand answers re mtgox. We need to know WHY they lost 850,000btc. Specifically, why. Not "transaction malleability". I can use jargon too. You, are using jargon. We need clear, undeniable, precise answers, from experts. Or bitcoin will stagnate, and may fail. Upvote this thread

eh, I'm not that committed to trolling like this- when i am committed, no one knows :)    
I hope you're right about July. I know the future is bright, but I think it's temporarily dimmed.     
I'm sitting on my cold wallet btc waiting until our market cap gets global. Then, I won't cash out, I'll just start spending on shit    
The cryptocurrency dream baby
@_date: 2014-02-28 18:24:09
your semi-quoting of experts worries me :(
@_date: 2014-02-28 18:41:07
I think you need to get laid
@_date: 2014-02-28 18:30:04
oh you. it's hard being so smart isn't it? Seeing patterns, explaining everything, being wrong, and then finding new solutions, and being wrong and then finding new solutions and being wrong and then finding new solutions...
It sounds to me like you are a complacent mathematician!    
However, if you're a pro, do some research and write up a paper. It can be audited by the community, and you can gain karma
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:31:20
it's not fair to say "you people". There are all sorts of cryptocurrency enthusiasts.    
But, yeah. We need an audit. We need answers
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:25:36
Look, you all are being stupid if you don't demand an audit by respected pros, and a transparent report. I may not be presenting this well, but my sentiment should not be downvoted. Our community needs answers. Bitcoin might be broken. Do you know that it isn't broken? Please share
@_date: 2014-02-28 18:57:19
i like you :) thanks for the back-and-forth    
I'm not a pro, and i hadn't seen that document before. I guess attempting to 'crack consensus' is in my nature :) , especially because the consensus are morons, and in r/bitcoin they are morons who are trying to get rich quick and don't appreciate the potential of what they claim to support /rant    
Anyway, the document is depressing but very interesting.    
It must go on around here all the time. It's like swimming up-current    
Also, why trust consensus??   
I know I've personally manipulated dozens of discussions and achieved top posts in many subreddits, but my intention is good. white hat :)

I think that until the truth comes out, things will be stagnant. No well informed investor would risk an investment without answers re the gox debacle.
please upvote this thread
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:47:24
You sound like someone defending the bible.    
I actually have some experience coding, and i can tell you that security audits on code are very time consuming and difficult. We need an audit.    
You should reverse your downvotes so that the community can see this
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:56:13
You sir, are misinformed. Exchanges rely on the underlying protocol behind cryptos. We have heard that mtgox was poorly written in PHP and didn't conform to the official updates. We need proof. We need evidence. I want to see bad PHP from mtgox, with new comments explaining EXACTLY how the bad code allowed for theft.    
You assume your paper wallets are safe because you have faith in elliptic curve cryptography.    
You have faith, that's my point. I want evidence.

i always go ad hominem eventually. i suck at arguing, even when i have valid points. I'm easily frustrated by idiocy and ignorance, and I'm not patient.    
The idiots rule the world, maybe because they are all dancing around kissing each others asses instead of speaking honestly and attacking stupidity.    
Accusing someone of going ad hominem, when they give you a scathing criticism, means you've lost the argument
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:49:34
well, thanks then :/ lots of people did
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:29:20
you sound like a fanatic. I love the concept of bitcoin. Someone just, apparently, stole 850,000btc from an exchange. Maybe the exchange is to blame. Maybe the protocol is to blame. I don't know. And you don't know either. And most people, including journalists and the average target user...doesn't know. We need closure, we need answers
@_date: 2014-02-28 18:42:29
Interesting link. I'll read it now...
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:32:46
no shit. and people like you are why we're getting bad press, and y'all might tip the scales and condemn cryptocurrency to failure
