Could they just give me 1 lol
@_date: 2017-12-02 04:21:38
Just depends on what caused it to burst 
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:13:15
Yes but if they have a stake in bitcoin, which I assume Coinbase would have a lot of, it could help them buy or sell their own during a dip
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:15:05
Anybody buying right now? Wondering if the dip is over and this is the lowest we will be seeing 
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:51:07
It’s all speculative. There might not be a dip, there might be a dip and it never recovers, or it might reach 50k. Just set realistic goals on when you want to cash out and follow through. Or hodl 
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:18:22
Because it has shot up 20-30% in a few hours and often crashes the server on the exchange. If you sold and were waiting to buy the dip you might not have time before it jumps 
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:43:21
Better advice is don’t invest money you can’t lose. Oh and also at close to an ATH, with dips having happened recently. This guy is retarded
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:18:24
If places don’t start adopting bitcoin as a currency then eventually it’s going to reach too high of a price to continue. Without it being a currency then people will stop investing as soon as this wave of new buyers stop and the returns slow down. But right now there is a chance at major stores and even banks accepting bitcoin and of course that speculation is driving the value up
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:58:17
So we have developed a cryptocurrency built around large transactions per second and faster trading, but it’s sold on an exchange that is still very limited in the traffic it can handle. Now that’s ironic. Maybe it’s the cynical side of me but I really don’t believe the issue was too much traffic. I think it’s in their best interest to lock out buyers/sellers during a large dip so they have time to either sell off their stake or purchase more
@_date: 2017-12-02 04:11:02
Everybody praises bitcoin here and boasts how it is a currency but then shits on a guy when he's actually using it as a currency. Nice 
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:18:51
As in good luck getting the US, or most countries, to accept something like that. It would either get shut down or regulated 
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:56:09
That doesn’t disprove any theory. Coinbase more than likely has a huge stake in bitcoin. If the price plummets from large sales, it’s in their interest to buy it up at a low price. Everybody here would have loved to buy more at 13k. But it would be harder to get it at that price when people start flooding in. Locking people out of the exchange would give them more time to purchase during the dip. It would also allow them to sell during the dip if they were worried people were wanting to flood in and sell
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:55:06
Was doing it the other way around thanks for the help 
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:37:30
Well my original comment wasn't even about how easy it is to find an exchange and store your bitcoin. It was about how easy it is to find ways to cut back spending to have money available to invest.
But I still disagree that investing is bitcoin is too hard for most people. Considering "most" people can make a Facebook, they can just as easily go to Coinbase and create an account. Clearly enough can, because the value of BTC is rising and businesses are starting to accept it. If your 80 year old grandma or guy who has lived under a rock for 20 years don't know how to set up an email, then I'm sorry but they shouldn't be making risky investments. 
I've known about bitcoin for years but have never tried investing or looking into how it's stored until a few weeks ago. I came to this subreddit, read one stickied post, and had bitcoin 10 minutes later. Come on man 
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:15:44
From what I’ve seen others post it can take pretty long 
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:14:52
True, but that’s why gold doesn’t get these 20%+ returns that bitcoin is getting every single day. Not saying bitcoin won’t still go up, but the returns would definitely slow down by a lot once it reaches a certain price that isn’t enticing to buyers

Good luck making progress with a currency that you can invest in, profit, and pay no taxes on 
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:08:56
Great post. The OP and a lot of people I see imply that the burden of calculating taxes on every transaction made with bitcoin could be a threat to the adoption of bitcoin. However, since the block chain is distributed and public, would it not be easy for the IRS to run software and calculate those numbers at the end of the year for everybody in a matter of minutes?
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:21:11
Diversify if you haven’t but it depends on your goals. If you are into speculative trading then I suggest hopping on bitcoin or other altcoins to get some returns right now. Litecoin isn’t moving much so until it does then I’d try to get returns elsewhere. Ride some waves on altcoins up and by the time you’re ready to move to litecoin you’ll have more to invest. But since this is all speculation litecoin could also surge at any moment and then you’d miss out 
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:01:06
What's not easy about it?
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:04:12
So anytime you cashed out for a profit during the year you will have to list that when filing your taxes? What if you traded bitcoin for some altcoin but still haven’t converted it into USD?
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:39:08
Jesus who still has that much 
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:38:30
Anybody else find it suspicious, or at least frustrating, that anytime the price dips far, Coinbase/GDAX lock out a majority of users? I couldn’t access my account at all during the dip earlier today and by the time I was back on it had already risen back from 13k to 16.5k

Bitcoin playing 6d chess
@_date: 2017-12-02 04:23:20
Any advice on sites to buy alt coins? Are different cryptocurrencies stored differently? I'd really like to have a central storage, preferably hardware wallet, to keep them all. Don't like the idea of navigating around 5-10 different websites/exchanges to buy and store alt coins 
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:09:08
What country are you in? Coinbase is extraordinarily easy to set up and buy bitcoin. I did it in like 5 minutes. If you don't trust storing it with them then ya there's some researching to understand how to store it privately. But even then it doesn't take more than 20 minutes with guides on this subreddit or elsewhere to do that
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:47:24
Maybe not the best situation but many believe in such a higher potential that you’ll still end up well off from the returns

@_date: 2017-12-08 03:16:22
You think it’s going to dip 5k why? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:40:44
But since that 500 was reinvested would it still be taxed? Wouldn’t it make more since to only tax if you have that profit on hand at the end of the taxed year?
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:05:39
If you aren't savvy enough to set up an email account by now you shouldn't be investing in bitcoin anyways. You can do it all from an app now, so it's even easier. It's no different trying to invest in stocks, in fact in many ways it's harder to do that than bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:41:26
Didn’t say it wouldn’t. Was asking why you saw that coming
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:28:41
Awesome tip, thank you!

I bought bitcoin at 9:29am today (also says this on my Coinbase receipt) but now it says I've bought it at a price of 10016.. what gives?
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:14:01
I wonder how many bitcoins he owns 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:21:24
So is Coinbase not recommended? Seems like a high fee when you're only buying small amounts..
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:10:34
If you bought $500 of bitcoin and it went up to 20k you wouldn't get a shit ton of money. You'd nearly double what you put in 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:17:17
I bought it at 9:29 and the rate was $50 than my friend that bought it at 9:30? Also fixed my original posts time it was incorrect
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:14:08
Always diversify, but even outside of cryptocurrency. I bought 1 litecoin for now because it's cheap. If it grows to bitcoin level one day it'll be cool to cash out. If it fails, it was a small investment. I'd say the risk is low enough because of its price to invest some into it 
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:30:09
Obviously if they aren't selling it's because they don't need the money right now. I don't think the average bitcoin owner has a majority of their wealth invested. It's a lot of people throwing in a couple hundred / thousand bucks 
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:14:24
It's a risk that could go bad. I'm just saying there's more to it than just dumping his cash. He can come to a conclusion that the risk is low enough for the reward and make a decision, and it turns out he was right. I don't encourage putting your house on the line for bitcoin but it worked out so be happy for the dude
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:35:55
Looking back now it might have been because I used a debit card (they don't support my bank?) 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:40:25
Damn. Need to move some money into a bigger bank then. Thanks! 
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:31:23
Get off Reddit, sell your phone, and invest more in bitcoin or enjoy being basic your entire life 
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:35:54
It's easy to invest in bitcoin without risk if you balance your spending elsewhere. I've cut back on spending for new games, eating out, etc and instead use that money to buy bitcoin. Even if it tanked to $0 I wouldn't be screwed, just missed out on some nicer things for a few years

I bought it within 1 minute of a friend and his went through at sub 10k
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:02:47
You're assuming he blindly threw money at it. I'm sure he did plenty of research and saw an opportunity. Still ballsy but you don't get rich without taking some risks
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:06:01
Any reason why he believes this? I agree it still has room to grow but 1 million seems insane (by 2020 that's like a trillion percent increase in 10 years)

Pretty desperate hacker to ransom a guy for 100
@_date: 2017-11-22 23:03:54
If a pizza with 10 slices is worth $10, then each piece is worth a $1. If I trade a few slices away and now only have 7 slices, I have $7. Now if the value of the pizza rises to $20, each slice is worth $2. So my 7 slices is now worth $14

You underestimate bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:29:43
Makes sense, thanks. The long processing time for the buy to go through feels like they expect a drop in value and are trying to short the bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:27:34
Why does Coinbase take ~8 days to process a purchase? Do they expect a drop in value? Seems like they are "shorting" you by waiting so long
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:26:19
Knew about bitcoin since forever ago and like many others regret not investing. Looking forward to the future, are there any good articles or sites that anticipate the future value? I'm very skeptical to start investing in something that has now spiked this high and almost everybody knows about it
