@_date: 2018-01-29 21:02:00
Are you saying that transparency is not necessary in cryptocurrency then?
@_date: 2018-01-29 22:40:53
So you are using web wallet? You can restore anytime if you have seed words. No worry

@_date: 2017-12-27 17:21:10
Yes. But not any more. China government thinks they can control money just like the internet. But they can’t. People in China doesn’t really trust bank. Normal people used to buy USD when they make money. Now they start buying Bitcoin. That’s why China government banned all exchanges. More and more China money will not be deposited in China bank. Check the foreign reserves in China. It’s going down and down. China government barely breathing with that foreign reserves right now. We will see the biggest economy collapse in human history. All the communist countries collapsed. All the countries that against the U.S. collapsed. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:10:24

You can use internet
@_date: 2018-08-06 04:25:40
Definitely more worth than that
@_date: 2018-08-02 22:29:43
They can. But the question is, would the goverment crypto be open, decentralized, permissionless, borderless, and peer-to-peer?  I think no. 
@_date: 2018-08-15 03:17:34
Now imagine you can send that kind of gold through internet
@_date: 2018-08-02 23:24:56
No problem. Go to Youtube and watch Andreas Antonopoulos videos. His speech is absolutely amazing 
@_date: 2018-08-15 22:24:09

Does gold have one of these characteristics: open, decentralized, permission-less, borderless, and censorship resistance?
@_date: 2018-08-15 23:07:41

Any wallet recommendations? Besides the core wallet and Electrum
@_date: 2018-10-20 18:56:29
The current core wallet doesn't support LN, right?
@_date: 2018-10-20 18:55:55

@_date: 2018-06-06 04:24:09
Sorry for the confusion, and I personally think people won’t spend bitcoin. They will just hold it - other alt coins will be used as currency. I think Bitcoin will be doing store of value for long time because its price is going up and up. 
@_date: 2018-06-05 21:55:09
I am a fan of him
@_date: 2018-06-17 04:35:35

@_date: 2018-06-06 03:36:58
Yeah it would have the problems when human used gold as currency. But this time, there is no government intervention
@_date: 2018-06-05 22:05:18
More explanation please
@_date: 2018-06-14 01:31:41
Good luck. Just enjoy the tide, it’s fun to watch
@_date: 2018-06-12 00:55:41
Why even there is limitation? Can they have all transactions in one block within 10mins? 
@_date: 2018-06-05 23:15:29
Haha you are right
@_date: 2018-06-13 20:47:39
Yeah it’s the game that we never loose. I believe in Bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-06-05 22:11:46
Crackers change the *compiled* source code by reserve engineering, so that they can modify its validation logic
@_date: 2018-06-05 23:35:11
Tell me about it. Make your argument valid
@_date: 2018-06-05 23:43:58
So what? I dont give a shit about who you are lol tell me more about cracking thing
@_date: 2018-06-08 19:36:01
Give me your explanation - why do you think so?
@_date: 2018-06-14 20:56:02
How long? I won’t sell at all! 
@_date: 2018-06-06 14:21:42

Yeah, I think you have a bright future ahead in yo life
@_date: 2018-06-14 05:52:34
@_date: 2018-06-04 05:48:10
We will be using satoshi in the future. Until then, the price will keep going up and up
@_date: 2018-06-11 23:14:08
She wasn’t holding bitcoins. That’s guiltyyyyt
@_date: 2018-06-05 23:57:21

I think Bill Gates have bought Bitcoin secretly. But he had to say something bad for Bitcoins because he has dealt with many government people and bankers
@_date: 2018-06-15 05:45:51
I believe that’s possible
@_date: 2018-06-06 03:15:33
Yeah someone hasn’t hacked Bitcoin, that’s all
@_date: 2018-06-12 23:19:54
That’s amazing, I wanna buy it
@_date: 2018-06-05 22:04:45
Oh that’s what you meant - yeah I still have some fiat, stocks and other cryptocurrencies. Real estate and gold are too much paperwork
@_date: 2018-06-08 15:15:32
Yeah TBH, I do that too sometimes. But Bitcoin is being traded globally. That’s the main difference. Sky is the limit!
@_date: 2018-06-28 22:19:16
Good luck
@_date: 2018-06-15 13:22:25
Of course, you will never buy Bitcoin with this price in the future
@_date: 2018-06-06 05:49:58
Bitcoin whitepaper exactly says about it. The government is good at cutting the head, but not the distributed system. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 05:57:58
Supply and demand
@_date: 2018-06-08 22:14:55
Yeah based on the number of ‘users’. But they are not widely accepted in a global level. 
@_date: 2018-06-15 13:03:44
Nope lol
@_date: 2018-06-06 05:43:35
Yes, impractical is better word. I forgot that vocabulary. Thx

Yeah in the long term, it’s still really really cheap. Life time opportunity 
@_date: 2018-06-05 18:36:54
Oh you did the same as me?! That’s wonderful! 
@_date: 2018-06-18 15:01:07
What did you use to capture the screen?
@_date: 2018-06-11 22:36:27
Now she can hold those bitcoins for 30 months! 
@_date: 2018-06-06 01:10:35
Yeah you are right
@_date: 2018-06-05 20:05:43

@_date: 2018-06-06 03:38:08
What is your occupation?
@_date: 2018-06-11 15:30:30
That’s a good news! I will buy more and more
@_date: 2018-06-05 14:44:18
‘Original coins’ will be survived
@_date: 2018-06-27 14:24:23
Just a lil bit
@_date: 2018-06-06 03:16:55
Haha electricity and internet connection will not be a problem in the future
@_date: 2018-06-19 20:37:49
People still use mail even though there is ‘email’. So no. But it will be a huge impact
@_date: 2018-06-05 23:17:09
Yeah of course I have some fiat though
@_date: 2018-06-05 23:51:25
You can’t prove? Then that’s a lie. Prove your social status then. Your car key and nickname on it

@_date: 2018-06-11 22:39:59
I am so happy now cuz I can buy more lol TBH, I dont want the price going high., wanna hold BtC more and more
@_date: 2018-06-05 23:59:35
My point is that the blockchain tech is focusing on immutability. So that’s what I am expecting on game industries. It’s already happening (not with blockchain) though - Xbox game on PC hasn’t been cracked yet
@_date: 2018-06-06 14:33:14
The possibility of those rare situations is super low. The possibility of bitcoin price surge is much higher. 
@_date: 2018-06-09 04:01:12
Lol nice one
@_date: 2018-06-15 02:16:38
I respect your belief 
@_date: 2018-06-29 20:56:09
Haha nice, have a safe trip
@_date: 2018-06-15 20:50:32
It will be a lot more expensive in next 3 years. A LOT. Don’t underestimate other people’s greed
@_date: 2018-06-04 13:42:55
We will be using ‘the unit’ satoshi in the future
@_date: 2018-06-15 02:38:16
We don’t know. No one knows. Who knows? By the way, the way you advertise that conference? That’s a horrible way to PR lol
@_date: 2018-06-06 15:42:59
Oh awesome, finally I got a feedback from smart one. Yeah I’ve worked on my app and will be opened as beta early next year. And I am definitely planning to use smart contract (and blockchain). Thanks for your comment 
@_date: 2018-06-05 23:56:46
Oops sorry I read it wrong
@_date: 2018-06-06 21:50:05
I dont think so. 
@_date: 2018-06-05 18:23:41
Right - this will impact all the industries. It’s huge. I believe this is bigger than the internet. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 01:05:19
Then I think it will go definitely lower

@_date: 2018-06-06 01:09:02
There are already uncrackable games (yet). 
@_date: 2018-06-15 02:26:58
You never buy Bitcoin with the current price in the future

Keygen is just different story - but for loader, I really wonder how it works without changing the game files
@_date: 2018-06-05 21:50:07
Everything resting on fiat is also silly to me
@_date: 2018-06-06 03:25:52
Yeah most of my portfolio was stocks
@_date: 2018-06-13 20:55:51
I have no doubt that 1 bitcoin will be worth more than one million
@_date: 2018-06-12 00:54:10
2 -&gt; why then 1MB? Does smaller block make the network faster?
@_date: 2018-06-25 18:34:01
I love that scene it was hilarious 
@_date: 2018-06-06 18:34:42
@_date: 2018-06-14 23:20:37
I buy more and more, this is the future of currency
@_date: 2018-06-07 13:26:35
Lol okay 
@_date: 2018-06-14 01:09:34
I can’t tell. Who knows? Follow your gut
@_date: 2018-06-05 23:54:57
I have some cash, but I really thought about holding other assets - but I am 99% sure that Bitcoin will be the global currency. I really believe so. 
@_date: 2018-06-06 00:43:28
Yeah I partially agree if the software doesn’t require any internet connection to run. With smart contract, I believe we will see more games on blockchain. And of course, there will be games which will not be crackable. Blockchain just opened the whole new industry of encryption 
@_date: 2018-06-19 06:24:22
It is already breaking it. The regular people just dont see it yet. I am not the regular. 
@_date: 2018-06-15 14:58:23
‘Bitocins’ - nevermind
@_date: 2018-06-05 23:44:42
And prove it. Take a pic of business card with your nickname on it
@_date: 2018-06-06 03:29:25
Yeah it is totally doing ‘store of value’
@_date: 2018-06-06 05:40:57
Good read, and I think blockchain is more than just hash and checksum - it uses time as variable, which is really interesting. Using my imagination, here is my scenario: a game company releases free-to-play game. When user plays that game, it secures the network (mining). In this way, the company makes sure that other games (ledgers) are not modified.  Right now, this seems impossible because of the latency but I believe the scalability issue is not a problem. Human finds a solution. We always have.

@_date: 2018-06-05 17:53:54
Oh one more thing: I recently bought some game company stocks - because cryptocurrency will change those game industries. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 20:56:32
Same for me, I have no doubt that Bitcoin is the future currency
@_date: 2018-06-06 00:45:16
You hold since 2012? Well, I admire your vision sir
@_date: 2018-06-06 03:20:46

@_date: 2019-10-29 04:05:31
Virus or downloaded the wrong wallet
@_date: 2018-06-06 15:53:45

@_date: 2018-06-08 19:58:48
It’s not - English is one of major course in their curriculum 
@_date: 2018-06-13 21:34:03
I dont really care about ‘today’s price
@_date: 2018-06-05 14:43:17
Why white guy picture is there lol
@_date: 2018-06-28 22:20:23

Oh the bank closed your account? That’s crazy. They have too much power
@_date: 2018-06-06 04:13:27
I think I need to explain the word ‘perfect’ from my view. 
It’s technically perfect because of proof of work. Hacking bitcoin is mathematically and technologically impossible. 
It’s economically perfect because of scarcity. It’s limited resource so it attracts miners. This is brilliant. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 08:57:57
Who did that???
@_date: 2018-06-05 23:16:36
Lol why
@_date: 2018-06-07 22:12:31
That will boost devaluating their money. RIP

I see, what if I put custom tranasction fees? maybe higher than 0.00001007 BTC/kB?
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:35:03
Haha yeah I hope the price keep going down so that I can buy more with cheap price
@_date: 2018-06-05 18:09:45
Blockchain technology is basically focusing on immutability. In the digital world, this was really hard to achieve. 
Game industries have been growing a lot, but there is one flaw - pirate games (cracking games). Denuvo is doing a good job but it’s not perfect. This blockchain technology will fix this problem. In the near future, we will see video games that cannot be cracked.
All other industries will be impacted by blockchain technology but video game industries are the one of major beneficiaries.  
@_date: 2018-06-06 15:31:21
I dont want to reveal my identity lol
@_date: 2018-06-05 22:50:12
On my second thought, I think the loader adds another layer to spoof the validation request from the game (or software). Is that widely used technique for game cracking?
@_date: 2018-06-11 15:16:18
God emperor Trump
@_date: 2018-06-08 16:33:26

Not made him, probably ‘asked’ him
@_date: 2018-06-06 17:07:50
Sorry for the confusion - I recently bought some game company stocks. That’s all. 
@_date: 2018-06-06 04:27:50
I just want to know your background knowledge in technology. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 22:20:13
Okay, the regular people have left. Now it’s time for the ‘reals’
@_date: 2018-06-05 18:40:00
Isn’t that game dev hides their code because they dont want to be *changed*?

Lucky you
@_date: 2018-07-13 21:47:58

@_date: 2018-02-18 21:36:34
No I don't want to do any illegal activities, I respect laws.  But I figured out that I haven't sold any coins, so I don't need to report tax.

If more than 80% bitcoins are hold by a small group(i.e. Chinese), is it good or bad? Or doesn’t matter?
@_date: 2018-07-27 05:23:56
@_date: 2018-07-18 19:28:39
Of course! It is the **first** cryptocurrency

@_date: 2018-07-30 23:01:07
Lol if they understand its technology, Bitcoin is the safest bet. They will realize this eventually but it would be too late for them!
@_date: 2018-07-02 23:15:24
@_date: 2018-07-02 23:14:34
It’s Bitcoin time!

@_date: 2018-07-06 14:59:33
I really wonder bitcoin holders would dump their bitcoin to buy Satoshi’s new coin. What’s you think?
