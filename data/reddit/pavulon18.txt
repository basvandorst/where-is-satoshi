If I may ask, why are you setting up a node?
I've read about setting up a node, but I could not discern a good reason why an individual would want to do it, other than to learn about the system or to be altruistic and keep the system running.

Thank you for the comment. Your statement was much better written than mine when I was talking about being altruistic. 
There is very little, if any, incentive for the average user to run a node. 
I commend and respect the OP for doing this. I just wish there was a way to make it more rewarding for us average users to run nodes.

I've been unsuccessful at buying online. 
The closest I came was with Coinbase. They are based in California but use a company from the U.K. to do their credit card transactions. My bank flagged my purchase transactions as foreign and would not permit them to be completed. Granted, I could call and over ride the flag.

I tried coinbase with my debit card, but it wouldn't go through. I don't know if my bank is blocking the transaction or if I did something wrong.

I think I might have just stumbled onto my issue with buying coins through Coinbase. I did not realize I had to verify my identity by uploading a copy of my driver's license. 
My verification is pending as I type this. Hopefully, this will fix my problem and make purchasing much easier.

The closest one is 3 hours away. Just so happen, wife and I are taking a weekend trip. I'll be stopping by the ATM to get some coins.

Tried through here too.  Once again, my transaction was denied.  I'm thinking my bank has some sort of block on these types of transactions.
