So the worst part is people telling you that you were wrong. 
Wonder why that annoys you? 
Don't worry - you will have plenty of teenagers with no understanding of economics that "it will all be okay". 
Feel better?
@_date: 2018-01-31 13:02:08
@_date: 2018-01-29 05:11:40
I wonder why you'd be so angry? Could it be because I systematically destroyed everyone of your points and exposed you as the amateur you are. Hmmmmmmm.
@_date: 2018-01-07 11:56:49
You had all your money making &lt;2% a year in the bank before you pretended to know anything about money. 
This guy makes 140% in 3 months and you tell him he made a mistake for cashing out. You guys really have no idea of anything. 
When you win at the casino - you walk out. You don't keep betting on 22 black. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 21:50:34
Everyone being fooled but you. Got it.
And illuminati play - ha.
I guess stereotypes exist for a reason.
@_date: 2018-01-28 21:02:06
Hmm it lost half its value and never recovered not sure if that counts as coming back.
It's obvious that you have no knowledge of finance that's why you think holding a currency is a good idea.
So I don't expect you to understand how bubbles work.
The bubble won't pop until dumb money runs out and reality sets in.
Your proof people are very dumb and will make their life about a scam. 
The tether scam is artificially keeping the bubble from popping. Ironically when it pops you won't have enough money to pay for the laser removal as they only accept fiat aka real currency.
@_date: 2018-01-16 08:56:55
So as soon as people actually want to spend their money, your currency drops by 30%. 
And this is the new currency of the world because?
@_date: 2018-01-28 20:30:35
Top level cringe. Can't believe you made bad financial advice meme a tattoo for life.
Some people just want to feel edgy I guess.
See you when the bubble pops.
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:37:20
You'd think I'd go back and fix it right? Damn phone auto correct.
@_date: 2018-01-31 09:08:00
I'm not married but I am subjectively rich. There's no correlation there.
@_date: 2018-01-07 05:59:49
Overweight teenager - loving the stereotype confirmation.
@_date: 2018-01-28 21:16:12
So why are you measuring the success of Bitcoin against a scam not real unsound currency?
700 to 11,000 of scam money gains.
You guys are too easy.
@_date: 2018-01-28 21:27:09
So the majority of the world is wrong but not when it serves to make your scam coin look good.
Makes total sense champ.
The irony will kick in when you get past 25.
@_date: 2015-12-06 18:15:27
You guys struggling to justify is hilarious.
@_date: 2015-12-24 19:06:10
How is asking if you've studied something you're talking about confrontational?
The reason I ask if because you aren't really making sense. You keep hinting at supply affects price but you don't seem to understand the supply and demand model. Supply and demand. 
@_date: 2015-12-24 18:10:02
So once all coins are distributed. No inflation? Or deflation?
You know inflation makes things more expensive right? So I don't know why you used it to explain lower costs.
@_date: 2015-12-24 19:16:54
So bit coin is the pig in this metaphor?
I didn't realise we had a way of measuring the intrinsic value of things without currency. 
@_date: 2015-12-24 17:50:15
What does that even mean?
@_date: 2015-12-25 03:45:28
So the spot price determines the value? I thought you just said it has same value regardless of the spot price. 
You didn't really answer my question and went off on a tangent about the internet.
Is bitcoin the pig in your metaphor and how are you measuring intrinsic value if not with a currency?
@_date: 2015-12-24 18:39:27
But monetary inflation affects price inflation. Things just don't go up because supply is limited.
They interact. I don't know why you think they are separate. More money in circulation can increase the price of goods because hey - there is more money.
Have you studied economics before?
@_date: 2015-12-24 19:36:01
You haven't helped you've just confused me.
Are you sure you've studied economics? Because could you explain how bitcoin fits into the supply and demand model.
Or if it is like a monetary system will it become deflationary when distribution is complete?
@_date: 2015-12-24 17:30:19
As in no inflation?
@_date: 2015-01-13 06:59:59
Arbitrage. Ha. Well I'm sold.
You've embarrassed yourself.

He certainly didn't do it on purpose. 
But it's crazy how a certain type of person will gravitate toward bitcoin, mlm, penny stocks, etc.
I don't know what it is, but I love watching the abortion as they interact with people that understand the economy and finance. 
@_date: 2015-08-05 09:26:54
That seems about right. 
And is there a student debt attached to this degree or did David Icke pay it for you?
@_date: 2015-08-05 08:54:06
Here's the thing. Quoting definitions and trying to get by on semantics isn't the best way to prove your point. 
When you ask a wealth manager that you want to invest, there is a reason he doesn't mention bitcoin or emu farms. They aren't considered investments. 
If you want to stick with semantics bitcoin isn't a resource in and of itself. It generates no economic benefits. It's just tied to other currencies and does a horrible joke of being stable at that. 
@_date: 2015-08-05 08:22:50
Exactly. There is a certain novelty to bitcoin but they want it to change the world and replace the current system. It will do neither.
I'll keep using paypal for international transfers and watch these boys go down with a sinking ship.
@_date: 2015-08-16 21:34:06
Rationale and critical thinking? You know this is bitcoin right?
Where teenagers think they are going to be billionaires while the current system burns.

Here is a video showing how pigeons create patterns and false correlation where there is none.

Would it blow your mind if I said it was a degree in financial planning?
@_date: 2015-08-05 10:35:19
I don't want to promote a ban on it. Not sure where you got that idea. 
Millionaire hey? That's awesome. Can you show us some proof?
@_date: 2015-08-05 03:04:24
I know I upvoted it just to see the bitcoin argument get destroyed.
I know those bitcoins boys have their own circle jerk but they rarely come over into the main finance subs where people have some basic knowlegde. 
I assume people upvoted it for the same car crash watching reasons.
@_date: 2015-08-05 03:10:37
You got destroyed by everyone over there.
You were met with valid points and arguments which exposed your lack of basic understanding of investing.
@_date: 2015-08-17 02:35:28
Are you insinuating adults can't have names like vagina_fang?
Where is your evidence for this?
I know asking a bitcoin cult member for evidence is ironic but I will still claim to be a man convinced by evidence. 
@_date: 2015-08-05 07:50:32
I'm a financial planner. How about you?
@_date: 2015-08-05 08:08:31
I have my degree yes. How about you? Read some facebook articles about bitcoin and watched a youtube video on the fall of capitalism? Any other qualifications?
@_date: 2015-08-05 07:58:48
I was referring to the idea of what constitutes investing. Not predicting start ups. 
The fact is people think Bitcoin is an investment and will replace the current monetary system. That is why they face such ridicule outside of this cult like group.
In regards to predicting start ups, I agree - financial experts are horrible at speculating which company or idea will boom. It's not their job to either. 
But don't you find it funny that you are arguing that people can't predict which start ups will succeed yet everyone here is 100% convinced that bitcoin will succeed despite the evidence?
@_date: 2015-07-17 06:34:02
What? You must be taking the piss.
What do you think hold means?
It means buy the index tracking fund, set dividends to reinvest and walk away for 30 years.
Hold your stocks. Don't sell. Don't actively trade. Literally do fucking nothing.
What do you define holding as when you first use it to prove the stock market isn't guaranteed?
No one is this wilfully ignorant.
@_date: 2015-07-18 15:38:00
Why would your opinion matter when you don't even understand the definition of a risky investment.
I still can't let go you called bitcoin a risky investment.
Have a good one.
@_date: 2015-07-17 08:12:55
Good work. Correct.
Now tell me how housing markets crash all the time and why leveraging is bad.
You know you have to pay interest on home loans right?
@_date: 2015-07-29 10:18:57
So glad it's an easy system for all to understand.
@_date: 2015-07-16 20:47:18
That's awesome. A literal sliding scale of age and not falling for shit.
@_date: 2015-07-17 13:58:23
They are already crying in front of banks, but that doesn't mean the current system is wrong. 
They did something wrong and it will get corrected. And we'll all go back to investing and trading as normal. And bitcoin will still be a hobby.
@_date: 2015-08-05 08:20:09
Asset. 
That's the word that will cause you problems.
@_date: 2015-07-21 22:34:36
I've never met a more insecure bitcoin fan boy.
You take the cake bro.
@_date: 2015-08-05 03:12:12
Actually it got voted up. As people like discussing bitcoin and correcting assumptions based on facts.
People who are qualified in finance absolutely destroyed almost every point he tried to make.
@_date: 2015-08-05 07:46:08
Let's finish with the deflation discussion first, I want to see what your understanding of finance is.
@_date: 2015-08-05 06:29:24
Did you check it out? It's all there.
The main argument that got destroyed was that bitcoin is an investment. 
@_date: 2015-07-17 07:44:23
So you admit you were wrong and what you said was idiotic because it completely discounts dividends.
Dividends change the whole game and the premise on you not investing in the stock market.
What are these other valid investments? You're obviously a well versed financial veteran. Please share it.
@_date: 2015-07-18 16:00:57
I've told you already. It's up to you to understand it.
Compound interest at 10 to 13% will change your life.
You keep going for the big hits and misses though.
@_date: 2015-07-18 13:32:02
Let me know when you learn standard deviation and why it makes a difference if you're going to pretend to be a volatile investor. 
@_date: 2015-07-16 12:15:26
There is a massive difference in that the stock market has 100 years of returns that give you a replicable method. 
You can only use hindsight bias with commodities and the like to make a strategy.
I think you are largely wasting your time if I'm honest but if you have personal proof of  long term returns that beat my compounded portfolio I'd be open to conversion.
@_date: 2015-08-05 09:39:33
We don't ban discussion on it no, but if you bring up gold as a legitimate investment you are immediately given the same treatment as bitcoin promoters.
Gold and silver bugs are reminded that the long term return of their "investment" is close to cash with horrible volatility. 
I guess that they are more sane in that they will accept the facts and not brigade a post and create posts in their sub saying "Look at these newbs that don't understand gold!".
@_date: 2015-07-16 20:45:44
It's amazing.
To have zero objective view of something is pretty scary. 
I imagine people lying in the street broke sucking off seniors for bus fare still convinced they'll be millionaires next year just as soon as Obama deems bitcoin the official currency.
"Just suck on enough cocks to eat and stay alive until you're wealthy and you show them all. Winners take risks......"
@_date: 2015-07-18 15:06:08
The current state is just an excuse. You would say that once is halves in value again and more countries refuse to use it.
Give it up bro.
@_date: 2015-08-05 08:48:24
Good one.
So you have no study of finance at all then?
Well obviously you're the best authority on these matters.
@_date: 2015-07-18 15:31:40
It's just gambling because you can't tell me your expected return and standard deviation.
I'm 100% equities. But I doubt the details would interest you.
@_date: 2015-07-16 11:35:41
People want to be told that their investment will make them rich. But there is zero evidence of a replicable strategy to profit off bitcoin.
If you want to invest in volatile markets, don't pretend you're not gambling.
@_date: 2015-07-21 02:48:20
And people say bitcoin lovers are cult like and arrogant. 
@_date: 2015-07-17 08:26:18
Didn't know how to reinvest dividends are get easy money.
@_date: 2015-07-21 03:56:49
I'd love to see your evidence of long term cpi being 10%.
I think you may be actually mental.
@_date: 2015-07-21 03:09:11
Qualifications were important a minute ago. Now they aren't when it's not in your favour.
You argue like a conspiracy theorist - jumping around when you think you're losing and resorting to patronising instead of evidence.
You won't convert anyone that way. 
Still haven't convinced me your made up currency is secure when you lost millions forever.
You'll never live that down unfortunately.
@_date: 2015-07-21 02:55:34
Oh you know him. But you don't have any education yourself.
Sounds like you aren't qualified to handle bitcoin either.
At this point I'm going to bet my first born you're under 25. Because only youth brings such confidence with stupidity.
@_date: 2015-07-17 09:48:10
Holding is holding.
Sorry bro I've tried to help you too much already.
Enjoy your returns and theories on investing.
@_date: 2015-07-21 02:49:11
Just out of curiosity and only if you can spare the charity.
Where did you study finance?
@_date: 2015-07-17 09:31:00
Yeah semantics. Just the semantics of 0% versus 1200%.
Even if you didn't reinvest the dividends you would have got a great return of an income stream from the dividends.
Either way you're wrong. 
So.....all abuse aside. Will you buy an index fund now that you understand how they work?
@_date: 2015-07-18 13:23:45
Cheers but I don't need luck with proven investment vehicles.
Give you the luck brother.
@_date: 2015-07-16 13:43:18
How do you think retirement accounts work?
I've given you a few chances to see where you went wrong but I think you're too stupid to even see when they are wrong.
Let me point it out for you.
You said invest in 1930 and you need 30 years to get a return right.?
I calculated it out for you.
1200% return. 
600% adjusted for inflation.
But hold on you said that it would take 30 years just to see a return?
See for yourself. 
Pick any period and measure it against your own risk taking.
Don't rush the reply in anger. Really think about whether you'll admit your mistake and correct it.
@_date: 2015-08-05 07:59:36
Should have used paypal.
@_date: 2015-07-17 15:07:48
Let me teach you one important metric to measure - volatility.
And that is what you don't grasp. I don't blame you though bitcoin isn't based on facts.
Here's a little test you can do. Show me any other major proven currency that drops 10% in a week when measured against US. 
Because bitcoin seems to do that and worse all the time.
There's a reason I don't put unstable economies currencies on my credit card.
That's the same reason it will never go mainstream.
And they have governments trying to  control the currency. You have a bunch of 20 year olds with zero financial backgrounds controlling yours.
@_date: 2015-07-18 01:23:00
Everyone I meet that says you can't tolerate volatility in xyz is always broke and with zero financial education. 
It same thing penny stock guys spout, pyramid schemes, buying gold, all these guys talk the same as you.
I experience volatility in my investments. It's called standard deviation. But I know how much to expect each year so act accordingly.
I bet this is the first time you've heard standard deviation and you couldn't tell me what bitcoins average standard deviation is.
@_date: 2015-07-20 20:46:50
But you haven't taken it off the table because it still happens with your ultra secure bitcoin.
So what's the point?
@_date: 2015-07-18 09:10:47
Not being ignorant floats my boat.
Again if you can tell me the standard deviation of your volatile investment I'd be happy to have a conversation with you.
If you think somehow the rules of investment and currency don't apply to bitcoin that's just a cop out. 
If volatility measures don't apply what's the difference between bitcoin and gambling on roulette? 
@_date: 2015-07-17 06:47:13
It's a shame you can't admit you're wrong. I straight up proved you wrong dude.
You said it takes 30 years to see a return after the great depression.
I called you out saying you didn't understand investing and showed you a 1200% return. You said it would be 0%.
You can't come back from that. No matter how much you try to twist it. You got straight massacred by data disproving your claim and ignorance on passive investing.
Pick any other period bro it will work the same. Around black Monday. Gfc. Any dip you want.
Just admit you were wrong, learn from it and become a better investor.
Or continue to lie to yourself and gamble with bit coin.
@_date: 2015-07-21 04:17:44
That's not how it works. You said 10%.
Now show me the proof.
Your data showed less than 3. And I picked the larger number to help you out.
@_date: 2015-07-21 20:51:20
120 years  of stock market returns proves you wrong. 
No one will believe you mate.
@_date: 2015-07-21 11:41:27
Give it up bro you lost.
You can't prove 10%. Even if prices did increase by 10 the businesses would still make profit and you'd be up still.
You need to study more and learn how the banking system and stock market works.
Or alternatively keep believing crackpot theories not backed by evidence.
@_date: 2015-07-16 13:23:54
Do you not know how reinvesting dividends work?
@_date: 2015-07-17 07:49:35
It's your claim not mine.
Don't state a claim then ask me to disprove or prove it.
Tell me these valid investments that you want to waste your money on.
@_date: 2015-07-17 09:42:52
Ha. I don't have the time to prove to you why that's wrong also.
Would you believe me, because I already proved you wrong on your investing knowlegde, if I told you that is incorrect?
I'm not trying to score points I'm just pointing out ignorance. My returns are enough points for me, I'm just curious why stupid people like you continue to be stupid after seeing the evidence.
I still have no idea.
@_date: 2015-07-26 00:13:53
It is showing how little every knows too. This sub is beautifully ignorant on finance.
@_date: 2015-07-21 04:11:34
14 years of cpi equals 39%. 
That's 2.78% annual.
Where did your 10% come from?
Quick last chance you're about to be dismissed as crazy.
@_date: 2015-08-05 08:50:40
You are correct.
Most people don't hold your opinion unfortunately. Or if they do they don't understand risk reward.
For example no one ever mentions the standard deviation of bitcoin. You don't happen to know do you?
@_date: 2015-08-05 07:20:00
Do you find it strange that you guy get downvoted in any other finance sub except this one? 
Doesn't that tell you something. You can't convince or Doesn't that tell you that maybe you guys are just circle jerking your own bullshit and you can't convince anyone who actually has some qualification?
@_date: 2015-07-17 07:14:23
Oh 4 or 5 now?
But before you said 30?
It's almost like you have no idea what you're talking about.
Holding is holding brother. Again ill ask you - how else did you mean it so your original point made any sense in reality?
@_date: 2015-07-21 03:40:50
I beat inflation every year. 
I beat it by 8% compounded.
You will also convert to the dollar. And bitcoin conversion rates drop 30% in a week.
That's not good value. Or do you think it is?
You bitcoin fan boys are hilarious the way you don't care about reality.
@_date: 2015-08-05 10:45:37
This is the problem and I hope you don't take too much offense to it.
You guys have no idea of the real data.
The standard deviation annualised (yearly not daily or monthly) is 139%.
Compared to the US stock market overall which is 14-20%.
If you don't think standard deviation is a good measure then you don't understand the fundamental concept of risk. 
Edit. I'd love to reply to you guys but I've been banned.
So much for accepting everyone that doesn't have a positive view of bitcoin.
Post a fact by wall Street journal and banned because you don't like it. Stay classy.
@_date: 2015-07-17 06:55:36
Give it up dude. You lost.
Take it like a man. 
You can use that calculator there is over 100 years of positive return data. 
@_date: 2015-07-29 10:17:49
Every heard the phrase don't catch a falling knife?
@_date: 2015-07-16 12:03:45
Speculation is gambling in investing.
The success rate of trading currency or commodities is actually worse than gambling on red or black on roulette.
I don't agree about guaranteed profits. You can get a guaranteed return with a decent spread of index funds as long as you have time to ride out a business cycle or two.
@_date: 2015-07-20 21:06:59
You guys are hilarious.
@_date: 2015-07-21 02:10:08
You can't think of something more secure? How about money in a bank?
You know what happens to my cash when the bank gets robbed? Nothing. Because they have a developed infastructure.
Mt gox showed the world why you shouldn't trust bedroom dwellers to  do your banking.
@_date: 2015-07-18 15:17:01
And we've come full circle. It's so volatile it could go either way.
You're not convinced by facts so ill leave you to it. It's just gambling plain and simple don't pretend otherwise.
@_date: 2015-07-18 14:48:33
You're the one claiming to understand the risk of volatile investments. 
The fact you couldn't tell me says it all. Hilarious.
@_date: 2015-07-17 09:20:10
I gave you many chances to apologise and admit your mistake.
You're the asshole for not doing so. So yes I revel in exposing people like you. 
@_date: 2015-07-21 03:28:27
Mt gox proves the security of bitcoin is flawed. Whether you blame people or an algorithm.
It happened. It doesn't happen with other currencies.
You lose.
@_date: 2015-07-17 08:24:57
I can't believe you're still giving financial advice after not knowing how dividends work.
You've got no idea brother.
@_date: 2015-07-17 09:39:54
That is a sensible answer.
@_date: 2015-07-21 03:52:21
You don't know the difference of governments and banks losing money versus individuals?
You really need a basic economics course. All you bitcoin boys do.
@_date: 2015-07-21 00:15:17
So humans are the asteroid in this clumsy metaphor?
@_date: 2015-07-17 14:50:56
Did it become a proven currency? Crazy, I honestly didn't know.
Let me pay all my bills with it tomorrow then.
@_date: 2015-07-21 03:42:46
You're betting on the fall of capitalism? Good luck with that.
That's as crazy as a doomsday prepper.
@_date: 2015-07-16 13:55:36
That strategy of buy and hold.
The one you first mentioned.
Come on man, you really won't concede. Buy the s &amp; p index and hold for 30 years. You can't see that?
You said if you bought in 1930 it would take you 30 years of holding to see a return.   
How have I changed the rules?
@_date: 2015-07-16 13:14:50
Wow you really don't understand investing and how reinvesting dividends work. 
It's not just a flat value that you can plot on two points.
You seemed switched on at first but I'd go back to the board and learn how the stock market works so you know which benchmark to measure against.
Basically reinvesting dividends allows you to break even long before it returns to its peak.
You are getting cheaper security and in times of severe crashes you are getting more dividends proportionately as the dividend yield is generally higher.
There are articles that show it only took a few years to break even and start profiting after the great depression. Long before the index appeared to return.
@_date: 2015-07-20 12:54:33
Mt gox would like a word.
@_date: 2015-07-18 09:59:23
Did you see me ask you for the standard deviation twice?
@_date: 2015-07-16 13:33:15
You need to wait until the business cycle is finished. 
But the fact you think it's something like 20 or 30 years shows some extreme ignorance on how financial markets work.
No offense but you're a caricature of a bitcoin investor.  Claiming they understand risk without understanding something so basic as the stock market index.
No wonder you didn't have any personal proof to show me.

Now I'm starting to wonder how many people are subbed here that aren't bitcoin deluded. 
I don't understand why everyone is agreeing with me in a bitcoin sub?
@_date: 2015-07-16 14:09:03
It's crazy. What is it? Is everyone a teenager or just too greedy to see facts?
@_date: 2018-02-12 14:11:20
Oh so you're not qualified but you seem you know about USD being a pump and dump. Hmmm.  Since you can't prove you understand the concept you can be dismissed as talking shit.
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:41:03
I just worry if someone was qualified from an unbiased site they might draw a different conclusion.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:43:20
Suddenly you forgot the fact he just showed you. You're convinced of the fact despite being proven wrong.
The sign of an idiot.
@_date: 2018-02-05 02:12:03
Spoiler alert - you're one of the stupid people.

@_date: 2018-02-04 10:13:50
You can't invest in an unproven currency.
@_date: 2018-02-13 06:51:39
Welcome to the table.
@_date: 2018-02-04 17:18:52
So if it's correct why does your post say the opposite?
@_date: 2018-02-12 08:05:49
Or because I'm qualified in finance and understand it. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 13:14:19
Sure. But first we need to clarify you know what pump and dump means   Where is the pump of the USD?
Hint: the Bitcoin dump occurred at 20k down to 6k.
@_date: 2018-02-06 08:18:35
You'd fit in over at We worked this out years ago.
@_date: 2018-02-04 16:34:21
Of course we can trust an analysis from a crypto currency website.
@_date: 2018-02-09 16:23:43
Bit of a stretch. But we'll take it it seems.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:22:02
His dad. His English teacher in grade 8. Anyone that he can scapegoat for his unsuccessful life.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:04:23
The irony.
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:02:33
If only it was an asset not a currency.
@_date: 2018-02-18 13:19:12
Can't invest in unproven currencies though.
@_date: 2018-02-11 04:51:29
Consciously manipulating your own market in the biggest pump and dump known to man. Love it.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:02:32
Why is one fifth of the access more than half the value? Skew much?
@_date: 2015-09-18 06:20:20
Yeah. You guys are busted .
@_date: 2016-10-23 14:03:35
Ha. That saying is never gamble, you guys really don't know anything.
@_date: 2015-10-13 04:20:27
So use my head to go against all the studies? 
That sounds like a good way to be ignorant. 
I respect data. Let me know if you have some.
@_date: 2015-10-20 14:28:12
So you're matt Damon's character? The super genius?
Nice one. Any proof to back it up?
I work in finance I don't just copy phrases out of books. Nice try though.
Waiting on your proof of being a hidden genius.
@_date: 2018-04-09 06:51:59
It's that simple!!
@_date: 2015-10-14 10:32:36
That's quite a load of conspiracy you believe.
Good luck with playing the victim. I've always found reality and personal responsibility the more attractive option. 
@_date: 2015-10-12 04:24:03
If only we had an established banking system that worked. Oh wait.
@_date: 2015-10-19 14:27:45
Where do you get the confidence to speak on such matters?
Where did you study psychology and finance?
@_date: 2015-10-26 02:53:42
Why doesn't someone with an educated view agree with my uneducated view?
@_date: 2015-10-12 22:13:43
If only burning your cash was the easy to do that would be a fair comparison.
The economy doesn't crash because of banks it crashes because of human nature and lack of reasonable foresight. 
Learn what a business cycle is then come back. 
Or if not continue pretending your volatile unproven currency is a good thing.
@_date: 2015-10-12 07:01:24
When is the last time anyone in America updated their banking app and lost all their money?
You guys are hilariously ignorant.
@_date: 2015-10-14 07:09:41
You said lower class are screwed. But that's a bullshit statement. Yes I call out people that say this shit in real life too.
@_date: 2015-10-12 22:40:04
So why are you defending bitcoin if you don't use it? Yet hate the current banking system. Ha.
@_date: 2015-10-28 08:03:14
So you tried to convince others but you should have convinced yourself of something. Did you?
My friends delete my banking app guess what - I'm still cashed up.
@_date: 2015-10-14 17:08:52
Nice back pedal. Read your comments.
@_date: 2015-10-14 16:46:19
I thought you were lower class and stuck. Now you employ tens of people. Ha. 
@_date: 2015-10-13 00:10:59
If you think the lower class can't move to middle or upper than you're an idiot who can't read data.
All the data is against you but playing a victim can be fun at times. 
@_date: 2015-10-13 10:28:35
I have no problem you're the one making ridiculous statements embarrassing themselves.
@_date: 2015-10-15 02:44:54
I'm not American you ignorant bigot. You keep embarrassing yourself by talking shit. Maybe it's time to stop playing the victim and get a bigger world view hey?
@_date: 2015-10-20 11:25:38
Wait are you taking the piss out of yourself?
Edit. Oh wait you're being serious. So you're pretentious and uneducated. Nice combination. 
I've got my degree in finance I can tell you you're way off.
