In a land of ultra big blocks nodes, miners and developers would be split across a couple of large companies. What are now separate entities would aggregate into monopolies via take-overs and mergers. Talking about "the miners" or "the developers" wouldn't make sense any more.

The alternative motive might be to avoid making the blockchain huge, which would having a "centralizing" effect on the ecosystem.
The revolutionary thing about Bitcoin is its "decentralised" (hence "trustless") nature. Take that away, and it's just a very expensive, very over-engineered ledger.

Good points. Thanks for taking the time to reply.

The time to validate a given block grows linearly with the block size, which is fine, but the blockchain itself would grow exponentially. My home broadband and consumer level hardware wouldn't cut the cake any more.




Companies then towards monopoly. For example, the telecoms industry consolidated, and recently bribed the American political system to put Ajit Patel in charge of the FCC.

Yes. It's already a problem in my opinion:

If Segwit fails to work, I'd would be open to the idea a well planned out block-size increase to bridge the gap until layer 2 solutions mature. I'm very much against the naive idea that simple blocksize increases are a good scaling strategy, as this doesn't take into account the nature of competitive markets which tend to centralize, and the nature of companies which tend to be evil.
It would be desirable to never touch the consensus rules, but unfortunately the fees are too damn high.

Not all bonds are the equal. Some are backed by the Fed, others are backed by over-leveraged unprofitable companies. The Fed can simply issue new money to meet their obligations, so they are about as safe as you could get.

Are you sure? I thought junk bonds are issued by corporations that are rated below "investment grade". If the corporation goes under, then they will default?

Why go to the bother of setting that stuff up to give him 1 cent??? :(

It's worse than that. You won't really have any Bitcoin at all.

It was the derivatives based on those dodgy loans that poured petrol on the fire. [Happily, they'd never do that again.](

So QE is the new normal.
I guess it turns out QE is not so bad, and can just continue indefinitely?

Hmm ... I'm not so sure we can blame the users here. This fault was very well exploited, and would have fooled most people.

According to supply and demand, changing the supply of gold doesn't necessarily make the market cap of gold worth more less given constant demand, it just affects the price of each bar right?

Did we all just read the same article?
"Bubble" is not a personal insult. It is a term used to describe EXACTLY what happened to the price of bitcoin in late 2017.

I'm not so sure.
Upside: 50 to 250 BTC, let's take an average 175 BTC. Minus costs of 0.08 BTC for the data recovery leaves a profit of 174.92 should things work out. Potential 218650&amp; ROI.
Downside: Loss of 0.08 BTC and your time.
Even if there is only a 1&amp; chance you get your data back, you are getting fantastic odds. Just don't get your hopes up to high! :)

Lately, we've been falling, then bouncing UP from 10K, so it's "support".
If we were repeatedly creeping up to 10K, but kept bouncing DOWN to 8Kish, then people would say it is "resistance".
Points that we're previously "support" can become "resistance" and vice versa, so some prices are considered both support and resistance. These are terms used colloquially by Technical Analysts who stare at charts all day, so don't treat them as universal truths.

This was a horrid bug in Electrum, which was very well exploited.
