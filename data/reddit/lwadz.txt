I was just wondering if its legit.
@_date: 2014-02-11 02:13:03
Yea man I agree. Its about time someone replaced bitmit. They just need to get some people on there.

What is invictus

I think pearhat hit it on the head; I think it was a purchased script originally, but the bitcoin functionality is there and works so obviously its been heavily modified. Maybe they should just spend a little more time mixing up the aesthetics.

I like what I see. It definatley needs worth but it looks like it could be the best online bitcoin auction site iv found besides Bitmit which closed down.

Bitcoin Talk Looks Pretty Good Actually

Looks like straight up 1990s but ive been looking for a decent functionling btc auction site for forever!
@_date: 2014-02-12 03:33:30
I like what I see but 0.01BTC a listing is way too much.
@_date: 2014-03-11 01:54:32
Is there like an ebay or amazon for bitcoin auctions and such?
@_date: 2014-03-04 02:07:49
@_date: 2014-03-11 01:54:46
Or maybe one of the big guys is going to start accepting bitcoins?
@_date: 2014-02-20 02:43:48
the freee now one looks kind of sketchy and it doesnt have any real items for sale. I mean a place to sell real things. Cryptothrift looks ok I guess but not great. Is there anything else?

For a beta its not bad actually. 0.01BTC a listing may be a bit high but i'd pay it for larger items if it had the customer base to support sales.
@_date: 2014-02-20 09:53:11
How come cryptothrift, allsos, and the others all kind of look like the same site?

Hello All,
   We'eve just concluded our first week of live beta testing of the new bitcoin auction site DistractedPuppy.Com and we want to know what you think?
     Our goal is to develop the  Bitcoin auction site out there and we want to know what you all think we can do in further development to make a site you'd use to sell your goods using Bitcoins. 
      We are considering all ideas ranging from fees and prices (monthly, per listing, per sale, strictly advertisement support) to aesthetic critiques of the site. So please, tell us how we can DistractedPuppy work for you!

It Looks Legit! Though 0.01 BTC is way too high. But I like the progress.
@_date: 2014-02-06 02:33:46
Clearly this is a Beta and not fully done. That being said it actually looks really promising. They just need to get the initial traffic. It looks good and there is a need for a new auction site since the rest suck and are sketchy. 
@_date: 2014-02-20 09:52:20
Wait so can you list stuff for sale on allsos?
@_date: 2014-03-11 01:37:10
Some of these are kind of deep! I was thinking more like unique stores ect.
@_date: 2014-02-20 02:46:40
yea that new one looks pretty good but no one is using it. Does anyone know why?
@_date: 2014-02-11 03:33:38
yea hahaha bullshit! I saw that but I also saw that someone is selling an old ass jeep on there.... I think if they get some real listings up it might do okay. How long ago did this site open? Its just a beta?
