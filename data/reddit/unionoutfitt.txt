stupid cuck.....He has no clue what btc is. The core of BTC is that it cannot be manipulated. The cme will soon find out that the only way it can go is up. It is an asset, not a currency. Think twice before you post your blabble on reddit. We have been here for years and all understand how BTC works. At least research something before you post. 
and again.
BITCOINIZATION / BITCOINASSIMILATION..all fiat is being pulled to the center through gravity. The closer it gets, the stronger the pull. The event horizon will start end of 2019. If all your fiat assets are not in crypto. You will end up with zero.
2018 wall street money will push it to $100,000.
Their clients will demand that they push it to 1000k.
2019 1 million per BTC. The world will collapse.

If it drops to 2000 I will sell my house and everything I own, and live in a roach motel.
