you invest for economy growth. Say your previous salary was $1,000. You invested $1,090 on yourself. Your ability and salary slowly grows to $2,000. 
Now you still are $90 in debt, yes, but that $90 is just chump changes compared to your new salary.

i was stating *facts*.
how people interpret it is none of my business

The government must render you a service or a commodity of equal value to the stack of cash you provided. 
US dollar is figuratively a piece of paper that proofs the government is in debt to you. If i hold $100 cash, the government owes me $100 value of services/commodity

every single cent of dollars is backed by the US government, like how stocks are backed by company's assets

ah yes, it is true they can both act as currency and they will have different perceived value. But there is a fundamental difference here. 
US government has assets. The country's wealth, land, economy, taxes, population, innovations all act together to back the greenback.  
Bitcoin has nothing. 
Perceived value of the US dollar can make the currency fluctuates, but it will never crash 50% in a day unless a nuclear war happens, because the value of the dollar is backed by the economic strength of US.


Then everyone holding the dollar is fucked. But dollar is the world's number 1 currency reserves for a reason. Everyone has absolute faith that the US government can pay back its debts

i was simply answering your question about intrinsic value. 
But sure, if you want to talk about inflation, you might want to know why [no single country wants a deflation economy](
Japanese yen has undergone deflation for *years* now. But no one wants to hold or invest in japanese yen, and there is a reason why.
