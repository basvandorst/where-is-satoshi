This looks great. How can we invest, even just a small amount? (1-2btc). It would be great if the Bitcoin community could get a piece of the action rather than just some already wealthy VC's.

Can you expand on that?
Is that because as miners switch off, the difficulty will decrease, meaning less power required to mine and hence a lower electricity cost for the miners per BTC recovered?
What about the scenario where the mining difficulty remains at record levels (because it only updates every 2 weeks), but miners turn off because the price per BTC is too low to make a return?
Genuinely interested in your reply, as I don't understand the mechanics of mining sufficiently to understand the economics behind them and I'm keen to understand this issue further.

Will be interesting to see what happens. My bet - people are going to panic sell and bring the price down. I predict USD$100 at its low point. Who knows how long it will take to recover, but it will. And probably to the moon!
* mining capacity will drop, transactions take longer because difficulty won't adjust for a while - people panic sell.
* people freak out thinking the system will never recover and that the time it takes for difficulty to adjust will be "an eternity", panic selling.
* people remember bitcoin is an "experiment", and panic sell.
* mining pool drops and centralises with a few major miners, people see risk of 51% attack increasing - and panic sell
* exchanges get smashed with traffic and probably go offline, people panic sell when they successfully manage to submit a transaction.
It'll recover of course, and then the price will rise again!
HODL :)

Thanks, hadn't seen that!

So given this is only the second halving in history, and the first where BTC is even remotely popular, you don't think that if we get to panic selling there isn't a massive downside risk?
I'm BTC long but also really mindful this in many ways is the "first halvening" and anything could happen.

We just had one over the last six months didn't we?

They won't be harder to generate - just the reward for mining them will be less. So there is a chance miners will drop out of the pool, which could bring on slower transaction confirmations and short term panic.
