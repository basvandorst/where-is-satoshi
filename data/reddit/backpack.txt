While that's a memorable day, we better pick one that's not so busy with people marching and overthrowing governments. I usually spend the whole day burning government buildings with molotovs so no, won't be able to make any transactions that day.
How about any memorable and quiet bitcoin day? Like when satoshi published the protocol or something along the lines?

I declare August 24th the start of a whole week to test fractional reserve in all altcoin web wallets and exchanges. People will withdraw all their funds to their local wallets, even ahead of time if they wish, to test the confidence in their providers. Friends tell friends to keep their money safe and it will snowball the whole week. All funds will be deposited back on September 1st.
"My money in my wallet" day. "Fuck Fractional" day. or whatever catchy phrase we come up for that day.
I know not everybody will play along, but enough to make online services sweat. So they better prepare in advance. That's our money, they're our servants, they better comply.
For crypto transparency, as bizarre as it sounds.

There is no better way to test fractional reserve than a bank run.
Once a year (pick your preferred lapse) everybody agrees on withdrawing all their funds at once. Next day, if the exchange survives, deposit it all back.
So, when is it going to be the first world-wide virtual bank run?
Pick a date, a memorable one, and stick to it.

Great idea, I knew I've seen it before.

Why bitpay hasn't implemented green address?
If you plan on spending some money you just fill a temp bitpay wallet with money that gets confirmed and instantly available once you do the transaction.
