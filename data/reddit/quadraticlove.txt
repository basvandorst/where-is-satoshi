There's no reason we can't do both. Raise the block size to account for current demand, and deploy Lightning when its ready. ~~The block size has been raised multiple times in the past.~~ mistaken
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:23:01
I don't think anyone here is suggesting that the only thing we do to scale is raise the block size limit. It's a trivial change (its also been done several times in the past) that allows Bitcoin to handle current use, and lets future innovations get developed and tested at a comfortable pace.
Even so, it should also be noted that [Terabyte sized blocks]( aren't that outlandish.

All the gold in our crust would have come from space debris after the Earth's formation. It's very viable to find all sorts of precious metals in asteroids, and in large quantities, too. Gold is only rare in our Earth's crust, but asteroids would have different percentages.
There used to be a time when aluminum was more valuable than gold...

"And if you use the core, and if blocks were 8MB you would need a lot of storage just to use the client."
Correct. My point is that you don't need to, it's not doing anything and it wasn't part of the original design. I _used_ to believe differently, but I got straightened out.
Larger blocks should reduce the chance of empty blocks since there's less competition for space and more revenue from more transactions, right?
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:28:20


[That's not true in any sense.]( You're not using Bitcoin if you're ignoring blocks from the longest chain. The whitepaper already mentions this - all you need is an SPV client to check for the longest chain.
Another thing to note is that if you're not being compensated in an economical system (Bitcoin is way more than just a technology), then you're not performing a desired function. "Full, non mining nodes" were never meant to be a thing. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 01:09:03
"1mb from the beginning"
Yea, that's my bad. Must have read that incorrectly somewhere else.
"raising block size above 8mb is not a smart or workable solution"
I'm not suggesting _above_ 8mb right now, but how are they "unworkable"? Other coins already have higher limits. Miners are also economically incentivized to build infrastructure to handle the increased load.
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:49:35
Yes, no, and yes. People are trying to use Bitcoin but they can't. ~~We've raised the block size before and it wasn't controversial.~~ (not correct)
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:45:57
Nah, they cost $50 and it takes an hour to get them. Haven't you been to a Seinfeld show?
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:36:22
How is 8mb huge when 1tb is feasible?
The miners get paid to process those, so they're incentivized to build the infrastructure and handle the load. "Non mining full nodes" aren't supposed to be a thing in Bitcoin, according to the whitepaper, so they shouldn't be blocking the improvement of Bitcoin.

There’s no guarantee gold will be worth the same in ten years.
@_date: 2019-11-05 20:36:58
We had the Great Depression thanks to crap monetary policy thanks, in part, to gold. The government nor its people ceased to exist. Treasury bonds are several orders of magnitude safer than gold or Bitcoin, though that simple fact seems to be heresy here.
@_date: 2019-11-05 15:40:52
The treasury bond is probably the smartest answer, lol.

Ok, now we're going in circles.  
 \- yea, that's how a sales tax works, a VAT is slightly different (for starters you're ignoring intermediate business to business transactions)  
 \- I never said a VAT taxes corporate value, I don't know why you keep repeating this  
 \- sales *are* new economic value, that's what GDP is  
 \- OP is 100% right that we need to tax corporations more  
 \- tax corporations and pay all Americans, and let them do what they think is valuable

Dude, come on... The Freedom Dividend will come from new value created by automation. That will become more necessary as robots do more of our work and human labor becomes less valuable.  
Yang is a capitalist. The Freedom Dividend is very capitalist and has lots of support from the right. Alaska has had a dividend for almost 40 years and that's a deep red state. The Freedom Dividend would cut welfare costs by simplifying administration. You need to get your emotions in check and stop slinging empty buzzwords. Yang is the only one informed on AI and automation, and he's the only candidate with a plan to help us transition.
@_date: 2019-08-20 14:24:47
Lol. Federal debt is backed by the production of the country. None of those amounts are bubbles nor are they problems.
@_date: 2019-08-11 20:21:50
Yea, the fees would be much, much lower if the block size was increased. "Low" fees aren't really a bragging point if the community shoots itself in the foot because of an ideology. They're only low *right now* because people aren't using the service as much.
@_date: 2019-08-11 07:01:43
lol, you're the one that's confused. Nowhere did I suggest it was supposed to be on earnings or stock value. The business pays the tax. If they choose to pass that on, then that's on them. They do that with a lot of costs. I already mentioned all of that earlier. The Freedom Dividend is necessary to help transition to a more automated economy, and a VAT is a logical source of funding.
@_date: 2019-08-11 05:29:28
\&gt;stats appear good right now  
\&gt;that means they never change and will always be good  
These points misleading and misinformed. Candidate Trump talked about how the headline unemployment rate is bullshit. It's calculated in a way to make the government look good. It doesn't include people who can work but have given up looking because there are no jobs for them. Also, our life expectancy has declined for the last three years. That's probably the primary metric for whether a society is doing well. Our society is obviously not doing well. That's the main reason Trump won. What's also interesting is that counties voted more for Trump the more that area was devastated by automation.  
Automation is currently having a big impact, much bigger than most people realize, and we've barely gotten started. Almost half of all current jobs are easy candidates for automation and will start to be automated over the next five to ten years. Truck driving, call center workers, and retail workers are already on their way. That also speaks nothing of all the other white collar jobs that are easy to automate.  
The evidence is clear that we have a problem now, and it will get much worse as time goes on. Automation and AI fundamentally change the makeup of the economy because they're essentially intelligence. AI removes the requirement for people to work to create value, just like how Bitcoin totally removes the need to have centralized authority. Empty, emotional, partisan rhetoric like "masturbatory fantasy" is not constructive and skirts the facts.

A VAT and the corporate tax are two kinds of taxes that can be imposed on corporations. A VAT is "taxing corporations". The Freedom Dividend is going to be funded by a VAT targeting corporations and automation.
@_date: 2019-08-20 16:39:07
Lol, how? It’s just simple logic, economics, and evidence. Every penny of spending creates debt. That creates work and investment that doesn’t simply disappear. _We_ are the government/society and _we_ have an incentive to invest in ourselves.
@_date: 2019-08-11 20:29:46
Don't know why you're laughing. You keep talking about taxing "the financial value of a corporation." That's not the same thing as taxing corporations. Again, you're completely confused and don't know what you're talking about. Word games aren't an argument. Nice try, though.
@_date: 2019-08-11 05:34:42
\&gt; Then they move overseas.   
lol, they don't move their whole operations. The value added tax is a "tax on value". You're thinking of an income tax. That can be dodged by claiming you made all your income in a certain country. Most other developed countries already have a VAT, so this isn't radical at all. The corporations are the ones benefiting from massive gains in automation. They need to be the ones to pay, not the middle class.

Ugh, I hate how stubborn and ignorant he's been on Bitcoin. He needs someone pro Bitcoin talk to him about it. He's shown he sometimes listens and changes his mind when he gets new info. Right now he's probably surrounded by extremely anti Bitcoin people.
@_date: 2019-08-11 06:44:16
Right, maybe read the link I posted. It's also exactly what I'm describing, lol. A "value added tax" is literally a tax on new value.
@_date: 2019-08-11 06:21:24
"Like a sales tax" is not the same thing as a sales tax. [  
You could argue that a corporate tax is like a sales tax because a business would raise their prices to compensate, but that's being reductionist. The VAT is a tax on new value and its purpose is to get a sliver of the new value automation is creating.
@_date: 2019-08-11 05:51:49


lol, I think you need to try again.
@_date: 2019-08-11 20:46:35
lol, good to see you've regressed to empty insults. You can choose to ignore the points if you want.
@_date: 2019-06-18 04:18:23
Yea. Any system can work if the members behave appropriately. Capitalism is like a decentralized economy, and centrally planned economies are obviously centralized, meaning less people have more control and responsibility. Maduro was a buffoon and screwed up his economy's potential while oil prices were high just for political gain. Then, when oil crashed, Venezuela's economy crashed with it. I don't see how they're going to get out of it because there are too many dragging factors like accumulating debt, brain drain, more naive interfering, etc.

In my experience, Genesis has had a terrible website and terrible customer service. I tried to buy a contract one time, and the website gave me errors saying something like it failed or to try again. Turns out, every click bought a contract, and I ended up with one or two extra. Needless to say I was mad and didn't want the extras they created, but their customer service would have none of it and basically blew me off. Luckily they process credit card transactions slowly, and my bank reversed the transactions.

I agree that Bitcoin will become more known as a defensive asset when mainstream markets are in a downturn. It's like gold but better and more useful, and it's detached from other markets like the stock market. We just need to make sure we buy and use Bitcoin, not just hold. Another way to look at it is like stock in the bitcoin community/corporation. The stock becomes more valuable when the company is more valuable.

He's also on the American ten dollar bill. He's a pretty important and famous founding father. He was kind of the head of the centralized approach to government while Jefferson was the head of the more decentralized approach. As a result, I'm pretty sure, they hated each other's guts, lol.

What? A dynamic money supply isn’t a bad thing. It’s just another lever for manipulating the economy, and we apparently need some improving. A more static money supply (like a gold standard) just ties your hands and prevents the money supply from changing along with the economy.
