I do actually still trust banks, dont have too much reason not to. The odds of a person losing all (or any) of their money in a bank is probably less than the odds of losing value from a cryptocurrency completely dying overnight right? I mean even the creator of bitcoin believes there is a 20% chance the currency might fail and be worth nothing.
And the big corporations and world controlling people that wants a currency to be controllable and hates the concept of cryptocurrency will start doing more and more to hinder the progress of it, and they only have to succeed in fucking it up once?
I mean I'm talking about something I really know very little about, these are just the things I'm thinking about at the moment, in no way do I think my opinion is the right one or whatnot.

Xapo was founded by the creator of bitcoin right? Doesn't that give you confidence in it and make it much safer? I'm from South Africa and spent the last few hours trying to figure out this stuff. (still deciding if I want to get into it. Any advice would be appreciated)

Yeah I was also hoping to trading to like quick %400 in an altcoin and then invest that in bitcoin long term, but that's so riksy, buuuuuuut I guess everything in crypto is pretty risky :)

So then it's probably better for me to wait until they come out before I buy in? Or can I store navcoins in something like electrum without downloading the block chain?

Can you give any altcoin recommendations that are &lt;$5 per token/coin? I won't blame you if it doesn't work out obviously...

Yeah I'm super keen on navcoin, especially for end 2018, can't remember exactly what happens then but read about it earlier today. Forcing too much info into my brain in a short time lul.
My problem with navcoin is the 800mb block chain I have to download for their wallet, as I live in a place with very limited data.

Yeah I'll do that thanks! :)

I think I'm gonna put the majority in bitcoin and try my luck with the minority.

Yeah I looked at it now. Looks super legit. Decentralized Dropbox basically.
But I believe their tokes are still unreleased? The ones you buy now are just called ECS20 or something right?
Also what is the use of SiaCoins?
How does these systems work if I want to buy in? Can I just get them on an exchange and then leave it in my portfolio for a few years without doing anything like bitcoin or do I need to do something when it swaps over to the actual coin instead of ECS20
