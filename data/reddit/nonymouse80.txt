Makes sense. Why does “us” have to change everything? Meters/feet. ����‍♂️

Data set to 12/9/18. We’re not there yet. Can’t wait for that bubble to burst and crypto to go back up.

Hopefully not. Or I’ll buy a bunch, but would probably already be broke from buying the dip of the dip of the dip of the dippy dip dip.

There will be an auto translation calculator that brings it back to the old US dollar, so it would be, $32,000,000.

Geez, just a joke of the office guy manager asking for something unrealistic.

Like buying a car or tv and selling later but not getting as much use out of it

You should keep it and not spend it. It will be worth way more than your fiat

More bitcoin that end up in a landfill from people not knowing better.

Bitcoin back to 6400! Ain’t no surprise. It’s like a bank account at this point. 
@_date: 2018-11-11 01:58:49
Just pretend you bought bitcoin at 15,000
@_date: 2018-11-17 03:23:51
Buy back at 5400
@_date: 2018-11-15 06:50:46
Me too!

Sounds like you’ve lost only half. For the time being, only temporary. If you sold now you would lose it. Bitcoin ain’t done yet. What if the banks crashed harder tomorrow than in 2008, and everyone lost their saving and retirement but you were saved from having some money invested in bitcoin?
