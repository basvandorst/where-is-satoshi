That's the great thing about technology! Just because one persons vision is limited doesn't mean others have to follow suit. It's very possible that Bitcoin becomes something much more than Satoshi ever imagined. It's also possible that it completely flops due to better innovation of an alt coin. 
Bitcoin and the block chain will undergo many different uses over the next few years. It's hard to know what will stick and what won't. But you can be certain that if people find something that improves their quality of life and is easy to use that they will use it; regardless of what OP's opinion is.

There's no way to tell what coins have been lost and what is being held. 
But do you think it's a concern? At this point I think there are a lot of people interested in monitoring the block chain. If a bunch of old coins started moving through the network I'm sure someone would catch it and post about it. Any significant activity could be compared to the price at the time. Any coins that are lost would just reduce the supply for any demand.

So according to [blockchain.info]( there are currently 15,000,250 bitcoins that have been mined. 
As mentioned we are a bit ahead of schedule because of the increasing hash rate. But let's make some assumptions to get a date. If the future hash rate didn't follow recent trends when would the last coin be mined?
According to this [article]( the last block providing a reward will be 6,929,999. At the time of this writing we just finished block 389,909. That means we have 6,540,090 blocks remaining. 
At 10 minutes a piece (remember this is ignoring the potential hash rate changes) we will mine the last rewarding block in 65,400,900 minutes. 
At this point we are scheduled for:
4/29/2140 3:13:58 AM
Now if you were to take into consideration the increasing hash rate we might be able to squeeze a few early blocks  here and there. But the difficulty scales out to match the hash rate of the network every 2016 blocks. That means that the time reduction we'll see in the long run is pretty negligible.
 
Edit - Reddit formatting and added a section about difficulty. 
Edit 2 - Updated to reflect a correction that pointed out to me.

That's a great question and not one that's easily answered. Many would agree with you that the market has already "priced in" the event. 
However, it's important to remember that there are other scenarios that you could use to explain why the price will grow. Take those that buy BTC on a weekly / monthly basis regardless of the price. When the issuance rate decreases, trades like this will ultimately drive the price up. 
You'll see many debates over the next few months going back and forth. You can even find these very same conversations on r/bitcoin if you go back to the last halvening. 
The truth is all we know are the fundamentals. The supply rate *will* be cut in half. Bitcoin is being talked about more and more and more. There is evidence that shows people are holding their coins longer and longer. Those all indicate that demand is growing.

I think people are getting hung up on the wrong part of the message. The primary concept being that Coinbase the "company" is an exchange not a wallet. As an exchange they do have a wallet that can be used; but only in a manner that's allowed by the regulation of the exchange.

I think that's a safe assumption. From a pure number perspective though, its technically possible that a large portion of older equipment is still running (highly improbable).  But as new equipment becomes available it makes sense for miners to retire older \ less efficient hardware.

Keep in mind that Mt.Gox was completely unregulated and implemented horrible practices. 
Coinbase is a regulated and [insured]( exchange! They've implemented tons of features that attempt to protect their users including two factor authentication. Not to mention that their customer service presence on this sub-reddit is very impressive. So much so that in the last theft I read about they compensated the user completely (even though he clicked on what could be considered an obvious scam).

Exactly this. Even if he was in a poor position, simply exchange whatever asset he's currently holding to BTC (or another coin), triggering a taxable event, and then back to his current coin of choice. A few dollars in fees and his capital losses would balance out to something more reasonable.

What wallet are you using? I've used Bitcoin to buy games on Steam multiple times, most recently last week, and have never encountered a problem. Steam uses 0 confirmations, the moment the transaction hits the Bitpay nodes it's approved. If you're using a reliable wallet this should be almost instant. 
@_date: 2016-05-10 18:47:56
But this is another step towards that "ubiquitous" environment you're referring to. This can only help to increase adoption which in turn paves the way for more development and easier usage. Just because Bitcoin is difficult to spend in a brick and mortar store doesn't mean it has to stay that way. That's what these companies are all about. 
You may not think that Bitcoin never needs to scale in that direction but others do; that's what's so great! It doesn't matter what you're doing the end goal remains the same, if you're willing to pay the transaction fee it should be processed as easily as possible regardless if it's a cup of coffee in a store, a hard drive on NewEgg, or sending your friend across the world some btc. 
@_date: 2016-05-21 18:59:54
I'm not sure that's how it works. If someone buys a future at $10.00 and sells it at $25.00 they have to pay capital gains on the $15.00 profit. 
Here is a link to a document by the IRS on how to handle taxes relating to bitcoin:
I'm not tax expert by any means but I think question Q-7 addresses the fact that gains are taxable. 
@_date: 2016-05-21 18:56:42
Taxes paid on capital gains are just that; taxes paid on the amount you've gained while holding the asset. So if you received something and sold it at the same price as when you originally received it then no capital gains have occurred. 
I have no idea what taxes are involved when selling something received as a gift though.

A Ponzi scheme is a system that promises to pay early adopters using the money made from late adopters. 
SCAMMER tells person A to give him $10 and promises him that he'll be rewarded with $20. 
SCAMMER tells person B to give him $10 and promises him that he'll be rewarded with $20. SCAMMER takes that money and gives $7 to person A and keeps the remaining $3 for himself. 
SCAMMER tells person C the same thing he told the others, but this time person A chimes in and says "This is great! I'm already seeing returns!". Person C jumps at the opportunity to give the SCAMMER $10. SCAMMER gives person A $5, person B $2.50 and keeps the remaining $2.50. 
This process repeats itself until one of the following happens:
1.) The SCAMMER runs out of people to scam (people stop investing money).
2.) People get wise to the fact that it's a scam and the operation is shut down.
Scenario 1 is a really interesting concept. Imagine if you had an unlimited number of people. The operator of the pyramid scheme would always be able to payout on the promise that was made, because there would be an infinite amount of money flowing into the system. The only time a problem occurs is when the money stops coming in. 
If you really want to be tripped out watch this video and see if you you can make any comparisons: 
Side note: Many people try to compare Bitcoin to a Ponzi scheme because the price of Bitcoin rises as adoption increases; of which early adopters benefit the most. There is a massive hole in this logic though, simply put, Bitcoin never promises an increase of value to any holder. The closest comparison in my mind would be a stock. If we purchased Google's stock before they took off we would have been rewarded for taking that risk. That same logic applies to Bitcoin.

This analogy doesn't work. Gold can be mixed with many other metals and is often done so. In this analogy the person melting \ mixing, would be the same as the developers forking the code. 
In fact this argument can be used against your overall point. Most jewelry that we buy in the stores is 14 karat gold. It's mixed with other metals to ensure it's more durable. Some would argue that hard forks have the ability to strengthen the underlying crypto currency.

I wouldn't go as far as saying it's substantial. To put things in perspective the hash rate dropped to where it was in June (last month). The difficulty adjustment will happen in roughly 6 days and put us back on the 10 minute interval.
As you know it's no shock that some miners were going to turn off equipment. But if I was running a large operation I would have waited a month or two to test the waters as well. If all of the competition started to turn their equipment off your's suddenly becomes more profitable than before. That may or may not be enough to justify running it longer. It's a total balance game.

The value of gold isn't solely driven by its uses in circuits or jewelry. A large portion of its value comes from being scarce. Because it's scarce people feel comfortable in the fact that others will still desire gold a week from now. This is why people buy and sell gold bullions without ever intending to melt it down into items like jewelry or circuits.
Now imagine that you had another finite resource (Bitcoin). In this case the commodity is naturally rare but also becomes more rare as time goes on (lost coins are gone). In addition to this you don't have to physically hold or transport a heavy item. Instead, you can send that commodity almost instantly to any buyer \ seller in the world at very little cost. 
In the end everything is only worth what someone else is willing to pay for it. Many people like the ability to hold an easily trade-able finite resource. That alone gives Bitcoin value. 
Here's a reverse example. If you walked into a Walmart with a broken old motherboard that has $5 worth of gold inlay. Do you think that they would accept that as payment for a candy bar? Absolutely not. Despite the value of that mother board being greater than the candy bar it's completely unusable to them.  
@_date: 2016-07-14 18:55:14
I don't think so. As a whole I believe the Bitcoin community wants to see Bitcoin succeed. That being said, every community is going to have its trolls. But censoring information to prevent them from trolling only hurts those that want to provide valuable feed back.
