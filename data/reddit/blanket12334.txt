Yet if those countries had control over their currencies, they would only avoid nominal default through massive inflation. They would still be in financial ruin, but they'd have the problems of extreme inflation to cope with on top of it.
Is that better? I'd argue it's worse. Especially when you consider that politicians may be more likely to bankrupt a nation when they know they have the inflation option in their back pocket.

Shorting is sometimes **perceived** as bad because the short seller is encouraging the market to allocate less capital to the underlying asset/project. The owners of the asset, or those interested in the success of the project, will consider the short "bad" because they believe the project is worth funding.
In reality, the net impact of the short will depend on whether or not the asset/project was worth funding. A short on a shitty company will help society by reallocating capital to better projects. A short on a great project will hurt society by reducing the funding for that project.

Another key point I thought about: unsophisticated investors often hold and spend cash. 
They have reduced incentive to save because the return on cash is negative, and investing in other assets takes time and effort.
With bitcoin, unsophisticated investors may start saving more because they will have positive return simply for holding currency. In my mind, that could be a HUGE benefit to demographics that currently lack saving incentive.

In the article you cited, M = money supply, V = velocity, and T = the nominal value of aggregate transactions in a given time frame.
The identity, which does of course hold, is not very useful for measuring the value of all money. If you scroll down a bit further, you can read a reference to Herny Hazlitt's correct commentary on how to determine the value of a currency.
"He explains that what changes the value of money is the value that people place on the currency, and that it is not the velocity of money that determines the value of a currency, but rather the sum of individuals' value of the currency that determines the velocity of money."

Sure, but the creation of a contractual arrangement with a vendor that allows me to instantly exchange my bitcoins for goods &amp; services is still increasing liquidity.
I want to walk into Reed's jewelers to buy a necklace. I must offer Reeds a very high price to induce them to sell me jewelry for bitcoin, or I must sell my bitcoins at an unfavorable price to a third party before buying from Reeds with dollars.
I can exchange bitcoins with Reed's (in cooperation with Bitpay) for a necklace, instantly at a very competitive price.
Sure, you can say that I'm not really exchanging my bitcoins with Reed's - I'm actually exchanging them with Bitpay, but the fact that bitpay is right where I am, right when i need them, and offering a great FX rate means the market is more liquid.

You're right that the original owners would lose out on potential gains, but they would be no worse of than if they had issued no equity at all. It would only mean that the added value of the new investment was mostly captured by the new investors (rather than the original investors).
The issuance was still beneficial for society, and beneficial for each party.
edit: you're right on the money - it's just I'm comparing Issance vs. No issuance whereas you are comparing Issuance @ efficient price vs. Issuance at inefficient price
@_date: 2014-09-29 00:00:53
Here's why:
Liquid credit instruments and money are substitutes, but credit instruments can default, reducing their nominal and real value. When currency is inflationary, society will hold greater value in credit and less in money. These credit instruments, due to their risky nature, are more volatile. When the market becomes risk averse, it may rapidly pull out of credit instruments and back into money.
When currency is deflationary, people never need to flee currency and move into credit markets, so you will see less severe increases and decreases in the size of the credit market. Since currency and credit are substitutes, that means less volatility in the price of money.
Can you explain why you think the opposite is true? I'd like to hear why that might be so.

The real value of land would fall, if it had been used as a store of value, because currency would become a more viable substitute.
However, the price of land is primarily based on factors other than its capacity to store value. Land is relatively illiquid compared to other assets, like government bonds, securities, or demand deposits. It's primarily the liquid assets that would fall in price, as they are more direct substitutes for cash.
I would still have incentive to invest in real estate if I could manage land efficiently as a landlord, or I directly benefited from use of the land.
TL;DR yes, but maybe not by much
@_date: 2014-09-06 16:06:20
I agree that the focus should be on facilitating wider adoption, and I agree that the best way to do that is by spending bitcoin.
That doesn't mean you can't also allocate a portion of your savings to bitcoin. Bitcoin was meant to be a store of value; even if it wasn't meant to be a store of value, it has the potential to be a very good one.

I disagree. Velocity is a shit way to value money. The best way to think about how the total money supply will be valued is by asking "how much value does society want to hold in money?"
Velocity could change, yet if society wants to hold 100 units of value in currency, then the value of total currency will be set at 100 units.

Yea, the extortion point is well taken.
Essentially the success of the project would count on participants refusing to cave to their demands.
Participants should be unwilling to meet a scammer's demands, because if the scammer is threatening to break the first contract, he's unlikely to honor his promise to release payment after his conditions are met.
I guess though you'd have a lot of issues with the "grey area" where someone demands a discount because the quality of their product is allegedly inferior. In that case they may not be seen as a scammer, and the counterparty might be willing to compromise.

Neither spending nor saving is fundamentally "good" or "bad." The most efficient balance between saving and spending will depend on many factors, but the answer is not always "more spending is better" as Krugman seems to imply.
It's true that inflation will push people to spend more and save less, but whether or not higher current consumption (at the expense of future consumption) is the best option at a given time is up for debate. I believe consumers should be free to find their own desired balance between spending and saving without manipulation from those who control the money supply.


Interest rates account for expected inflation, so consistent inflation OR deflation will result in a stable debt burden. Volatility in either inflation OR deflation will cause volatility in the real value of debt. Stable deflation is no worse or better than stable inflation in this regard.
Krugman's concern on this point is also tied to a desire for more spending and less saving, which is not necessarily preferable.


This point is valid. IF some workers are unwilling to accept an efficient real wage because it is lower in nominal terms, those workers will be out of work. Fortunately, the bias for stable or rising nominal wages may be small in an economy with constant deflation.

If you're talking about "how does the market set price" the answer is: individuals choose how much value they want to hold in currency, and price (goods per currency unit) adjusts for any given supply.

I agree. Land would still  increase in value over time, though it might see a small "one time" reduction in value if an asset was introduced that could act as a substitute for one of the benefits offered by land (fixed supply money would be a substitute as a store of value). The question is, to what extent is land's value derived from its ability to store value? Probably not a great deal, as other more liquid assets exist that already serve the same purpose.
TL;DR I agree

Great question - real returns on the stock market in the USA have averaged nearly 7% per year for the last 200 years. That's quite a strong return, and you should only choose to invest in bitcoin if you think the real return is likely to exceed 7%!
Additionally, you should account for the risk of adding bitcoin to your portfolio, since the asset is very volatile. This might mean that only a very small portion of your assets should be allocated to bitcoin, even if you believe the expected return on bitcoin is &gt;7%.

Diversifying is a great idea! You can reduce your risk and be much more confident that your savings will grow over time.
Believe it or not, the stock market is a great place to diversify. Although there is short term volatility, it has [stable and strong returns]( in the long run. You can also use a tax advantaged account like a Roth IRA to pay NO taxes on those returns.
Also, although your net worth may seem significant, you are still young. Keep working and saving, and you will enjoy stability and flexibility for your whole life. There's no need to deplete your savings, simply because you can.

**Edit2:** CyanideandMadness shared the picture with me. It was very convincing. The fact that he has a child and took the time to post the picture to validate his claim, along with the large amount of time he committed to writing sincere responses AFTER the time had passed to collect tips leads me to believe that he is genuine.
There is always the possibility that it's all a clever ruse, but **I am firmly in the "believer" camp.**

I think the conservative valuation for the (very very unlikely) case where bitcoin becomes the major world currency is $100,000 per coin. that would imply 2BTC per kid could cover the cost of a $200k tuition.

It's obviously false, but I'll debunk it with math, just for fun.
Guac costs $1.80

You correctly explained "my" definition when you said "meaning you can cash out easier"
That is the same definition as Wikipedia and Investopedia. The ease (or cost) of exchanging an asset defines its liquidity according to me, wikipedia, investopedia, and the rest of the world.

The stock market surge can last longer than you and I at an average rate of nearly 7% (it has done so for the last 200 years in the USA).
That said - bitcoin is a great investment if you believe the returns will exceed 7% per year (I do!).
@_date: 2014-09-26 15:51:59
Yea, but sometimes people make investments that have negative real yield (are unproductive), simply because the real yield of cash is even lower. That does NOT benefit society.
If the money supply is stable, citizens will easily be able to balance between investing (should be done in cases where real yield of the investment exceeds the opportunity cost) and saving resources for other uses. Inflation, and money supply instability, make it harder to make the right investment choices that actually benefit society and capitalism!!!

It depends on the case. 
Sometimes, I might get a discount from the vendor because they avoid fees and the risk of chargebacks (see Newegg, Gyft).
Other times, it might be to support the companies that choose to accept bitcoin, increasing liquidity (number of places we can all spend), and ultimately allowing people to convert less to fiat.

The miners already do charge fees. Coinbase and Circle will pay the fees for you, because they can earn money off you through tangential services. Thus, the transfer is effectively free to the user.

I would dispute the feds impact on reducing volatility of the value of money. Despite fed control we have seen many periods of instability in the price of money.
Of course prices are more stable in the last 50 years than they were 150 years ago... we have modern efficient capital markets in which many players can help set and stabilize prices. The Fed isn't the only difference between modern and historical money markets.
@_date: 2014-10-06 12:29:58
Circle's sell price is the same as their buy price. Free.
@_date: 2014-09-15 02:54:26
It depends on the firm. I executed a transaction with Chase and it was not treated as a cash advance.
@_date: 2014-03-21 18:59:24


Periods of unexpected rapid growth of the money supply will drive up levels of economic activity beyond the efficient level, just as rapid deflation will drive down levels of economic activity below the efficient level, but it's not clear whether either stable inflation or deflation will cause more or less "frugality".
Although the incentive to hold money as a means of storing value is low in an inflationary environment, other assets (like credit &amp; securities) can still generate return. Thus, although the incentive to hold cash decreases with inflation, the incentive to save may not.
In fact, in a deflationary environment, more value would be held in cash, rather than other less liquid financial assets as they are today. The higher liquidity of individuals' assets might lead them to spend more, rather than less. Overall I consider it likely that levels of economic activity are, on average, efficient, in both inflationary and deflationary environments. It's the volatility that would decrease if currency was fixed supply, not the average total output.
I don't think there are downfalls of using BTC from a monetary perspective. From a technical perspective, there may be risk of the protocol failing. I don't know enough to say one way or another.
If the protocol is sound, then adoption of BTC would be very beneficial to the global economy.
@_date: 2014-07-19 05:01:12

I think dedicating fees towards lobbying would be unwise, as the control of the use of the funds would be corrupted. We're forced to rely on individuals to voluntarily choose to influence the market, which is, I guess, always true.

Deflation is not compatible with depressed bitcoin prices. If bitcoin's value is depressed, then there is inflation (and vice versa).
You've sort of asked "will the rising value of bitcoin cause the value of bitcoin fall?"
@_date: 2014-09-19 19:12:38

I disagree.
Liquidity is degree to which an asset or security can be bought or sold in the market without affecting the asset's price. If I wanted to exchange my bitcoin for many goods and services, I would only be able to do so at a steep discount, if at all. 
If no one will take my bitcoin, it would be completely illiquid. If some people will take my bitcoin, but at a discounted rate, the market for bitcoin is more liquid. The more people that are willing to exchange my bitcoin for goods and services (especially without demanding a steep discount) the more liquid the market is.

How can I tip Tim Lee some bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-09-06 15:36:00
The logic in the article is flawed.
People must choose between spending and saving through ANY medium, and subsequently choose the best way to spend and the best way to save.
If you choose to spend $1 of value, you can use bitcoin, cash, debit card, etc.
If you choose to save $1 of value, you can hold those savings in bitcoin, cash, securities, gold, real estate, etc.
Thus, the assertion that bitcoin is a poor investment does not imply that spending bitcoin is the good option. Someone could simply choose to save in another asset like stocks.
In the same way, the fact that spending bitcoin is a good idea does not imply that saving bitcoin is a bad idea.
**The bottom line:**
Spending bitcoin is one of the best ways to spend, if you are going to spend.
But also, saving bitcoin is a great way to save, if you are going to save.
@_date: 2014-09-19 19:28:13
I agree, it's tough to do. Also, the bias towards holding a fixed amount of BTC could actually result in reductions to Demand as prices fall. 
There's definitely substantial risk of massive price declines, but on the other hand, we know that Supply is capped, so if Demand increases vastly (and there's lots of room to grow) the price may move up a lot.

After some research, I learned that if you give away a diamond, you also incur no capital gains tax. The recipient of your gift will inherit the cost basis of your gift, so they will be liable for tax payment on sale.

Ah, OK!
That's a great question. It's the same for Bitcoin as it is for other currencies. People decide how much **value** they want to hold in currency (because it's liquid and safe) and then since the supply can't change, the prices will move so that the fixed supply is equal to the desired value.
More about it in [this post](

I'm not sure I understand your question. Can you rephrase?
@_date: 2014-10-08 12:53:18
How would they devalue the currency? Who gets the additional notes that are printed?
It seems like if the notes are distributed proportionally to current note holders, then the real value of their money holdings would remain unchanged and so purchasing power abroad and at home would remain unchanged (you'd just find a new equilibrium at a higher price level).
If new notes were all claimed and spent by the government, then you would get the intended result: locals will buy less and sell more across the border. However, this result is merely a product of a poorer population... when they have less money in real terms they are forced to buy less and sell more. That seems like a bad thing!
I guess I'm having trouble understanding why a current account surplus or deficit is a good or bad thing. Maybe you could elaborate on that for me?

1) The consensus doesn't matter - correct logic matters. The fact that other notable economists like Ludwig Von Mises or Milton Friedman also agree with the views held by Hazlitt does not necessarily mean that the views are correct. The logic of Hazlitt's view stands on its own.
4) Just because the equation holds, and it can be used to value money, doesn't mean that it is the best way to value money, let alone the only way.
3) The logic applies as much to any specific currency as it does to money overall. The value that society wishes to hold in that specific currency will set prices for any given supply.
4,5) OK.
In conclusion:
Yes, it is possible to use the equation V = P*Q / M to determine price (and thus the value of money), however it is not the best method, because V, M, and Q must be predicted. It is more simple, practical, and easier to use to equation: P = D / M, where P = price, M = currency supply, and D = desired value held in the currency, as D and M are more easily predicted and measured than are V, Q and M.

The seller has written a contract to say "If you pay me $X now, I will deliver the shares of the underlying asset for you in the future." The contract is real and the price movement is real.
Why is the contract bad? I still don't understand the harm.
Do you think the sellers are necessarily wrong about the asset being overvalued?

I must have missed that picture. That would be fairly compelling evidence of the accuracy of the story. I bet if you followed up with the "aftermath" and further evidence people would appreciate it and would offer much support.

I strongly disagree with a lot of the assertions made in the film. They attempt to demonize groups of people to fit their narrative.

Could you explain why that would be an issue and how controlling money and credit markets could positively impact the situation?
I can't envision it without further detail. Thanks

When society chooses to save more in bitcoin, the amount of bitcoin that is saved stays fixed (by math) so the only other factor which must change is the aggregate price level (also easy to determine by math). The real implications of a higher currency savings rate could be negligible.
In practice, it's likely that during some periods of inflation people will consume too much in real terms, while, during some periods of deflation people will save too much. Neither is fundamentally better or worse, but a fixed supply currency will allow society to more accurately anticipate future price changes, and therefore more efficiently strike the balance between saving and consuming in real terms.
**In short:**
Saving currency doesn't cause harm.

It's probably a better idea to keep your diamond more secure so it doesn't get stolen. If you're not that concerned about losing the diamond, and you are concerned about the hassle and cost of taxes, you should consider giving the diamond away.
You could give the diamond away to **anyone** (or even send it to any mailbox that isn't yours) and they would be responsible for paying capital gains on your old cost basis if they ever were to sell the asset. You would have no taxes due after you gave away the diamond.
@_date: 2014-08-24 14:12:19
True, but it would be better to compare the value of bitcoin to other currencies, than to businesses.

I trust you OP. Just do the right thing. :)

It makes sense that when the risk profile of the bond changed, the ownership would change as well.
Bonds should change hands, and bondholders have every right to collect on what they are owed. It's good that US courts have common sense, even if the author of the article does not.

I would also be able to initiate short positions in the stock market and sell the equivalent contract. Perhaps if stocks are likely to see a significant drop in the near term, you would be interested in that service. Does that interest you more?

Thanks. Interesting info.
I'm still not clear on why a current account surplus or deficit is good or bad. Could you talk to that as well?
@_date: 2014-10-07 01:17:05
That's interesting that you say they didn't have extreme inflation. In my understanding, most insolvent countries with control over the money supply monetize the debt and cause inflation. I'd like to learn more though about what you said. Could you point me to examples of sovereigns that ran into financial trouble, but didn't resort to printing cash, when they had the means to do so?
That would be much appreciated. Thanks

You could write the code such that a second signature is only required (and distributed) once the second down payment is submitted.

Ultimately buyers would have to trust the seller. I would expect that buyers would typically use them for small amounts ($5 or $10) just to introduce people to bitcoin. The seller would earn less by scamming a few customers and subsequently going out of business than by continuing to successfully sell scratch offs.
@_date: 2014-10-06 12:29:32
You should compare the SELL price as well.
You would find that Coinbase has a relatively unfavorable sell price, while Circle's is very attractive.

A given unit cannot be both saved and spent at the same time. However, a given person can increase the amount of bitcoin he saves and spends simultaneously, by switching away from non-bitcoin spending and saving options.

Ease of cashing out and/or being able to cash out at a better price is liquidity:
Investopedia - 
"The degree to which an asset or security can be bought or sold in the market without affecting the asset's price"
If I can't exchange my bitcoin for other assets at a decent price in certain times and locations the market is illiquid. Increasing the number of counter-parties that facilitate bitcoin exchange increases liquidity.
Wikipedia - 
"a market's ability to facilitate an asset being sold quickly without having to reduce its price very much"
If I can exchange my bitcoin for jewelry more quickly and at a better price than before, liquidity has increased.
This is not my definition. It is THE definition.

I guessed the same and will be attending.

You're correct that it would mirror the size of the economy. As greenearplugs suggests, that may be around 2%.

If I'm in Reed's before bitpay and I have bitcoin, I can cash out only at ~$0 per bitcoin. Maybe they would give me $1 of value for my Bitcoin. If I'm in Reed's more recently, I can cash out at ~$475 per bitcoin (or the equivalent value in goods).
In the former case, I couldn't make a large transaction without reducing the price. In the latter case, I can.

Yep very similar. Sort of like the itunes ones where you enter a code to redeem for value on itunes, except in this case it's a random string that was used to generate a private key on rushwallet.com

I didn't. I'm confused by your post.

An end to quantitative easing would actually increase the value of the dollar.
But to address your main point - 
Bitcoin has not reached a point yet where the likelihood of failure is remote. There will come a time when the dangers of regulation, the failure of the protocol to adapt efficiently, etc are small enough to hold the majority of your wealth in bitcoin, but now is not the time.

You're right I should have said "insurance payment" rather than down payment. That amount is what is set aside strictly to ensure your counter-party does fair business.
The insurance payment is paid equally by both parties in the beginning, and returned to each party equally at the end.
If I'm selling you a laptop for 1 BTC, we could agree on, say, 0.1 BTC insurance. We each pay in the 0.1 BTC, you submit payment to digital escrow, then I send you the powerbook.
If it turns out to be a p-p-p-powerbook, you would not release my payment. In the event of an attempted scam it will be bad for both parties. Both parties will lose the insurance payment, and a buyer may lose his 1 BTC. However, there is very low risk of a scam attempt because the scammer will also be forced to sacrifice.
