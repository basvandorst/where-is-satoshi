I've lost access to two exchanges because my phone bricked. As a consequence I lost access to a Gmail account, which I used for some emails. I couldn't reset Gmail because I used a phone number then that is no longer active. So, exchanges nowThey want screenshots of my bitcoin transactions from 2013 to their exchanges to reset it, which I have not been able to find for weeks of trying , and may be from a wallet I've not used in years. 
It can be a nightmare resetting 2fa, make proper backups.
