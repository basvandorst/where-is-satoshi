I’m twice over an engineer and I work on developing blockchain related technology everyday.

Arguably, by contrast, you guys aren't the idiots, but the people who are buying now might be. All I'm saying, is don't be the one left holding the bag. People don't seem to be considering that as a possibility.

Also it's not about age, it's about the fact that maybe, just maybe, bitcoin actually is a bubble. Is that not possible? It sure acts like one.

Let’s hope your cheeks don’t end up salty.
How big is it? Look at the numbers. Is bitcoin a $100 billion asset, $1 trillion asset, $10 trillion asset? There’s no way to know, but the buyers dry up at some number.

No, no, no, blockchain tech is valuable. There’s nothing inherit to bitcoin that is. And everything you’ve mentioned I can already do much more simply and quickly with my bank account/Venmo.

Big picture here. The awesome tech has little to do with the currency’s current value. What do you think is more likely? People are buying now because they’ve heard about problems being solved/interesting tech? Or they don’t want to miss out on an opportunity to make a quick buck.

Characteristic of a Ponzi scheme.

Obviously you don’t know what it means, because it’s the critical part of the point I’m making which you seem to be missing. Everyone buying now is dreaming of selling their bitcoin for more than they bought it for. (More things, more fiat, whatever)
They are quite literally trying to pass the buck to the next set of people who are willing to pay more money for the same amount of bitcoin. Those people in turn have the same hopes. At some point there’s no one left to sell to.
The grammar mistakes are because I’m on my phone.

What? How exactly does it do that? How are those even related?

Here's the CSV: 
I'm 15650. If you google the hash, you can see my password in plain text. (I've since changed my passwords.) You can also look up my github if you're interested. It's the same username.

What you fail to realize is that they’re not doing that! There was a post at the top of this thread saying he “got out” for 200k because it was too risky to him. Does that sound like he was selling his dollars for bitcoin? Am I wrong here?

I had bitcoin in 2010 before MtGox was hacked. I’ve been around as long as you, no doubt.

You think there is no wisdom here? Have we learned nothing from bubbles of the past? Do you think anyone is buying bitcoin for its use as a currency? Or just to pass the buck to the next guy willing to give them more.

I did and I was. I never bought it though because it was pretty complicated. I got bitcoin from faucets because they were giving out bitcoin at the time. I’m in that 2011 CSV though.
