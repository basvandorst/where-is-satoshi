It's unpaid taxes on profits made at the time of cashout to fiat that the IRS cares about. Not sure why you're even concerned in any tax year.

Yes, but only if it was four times as popular as Bitcoin. If BTC could handle the number of transactions that LTC can handle right now (presegwit) it wouldn't currently have any problems.

Here let me help you out with facts about LTC. I'll add a few things I think as well.
- Block times are 2.5 minutes.
- Blocks are 1 Mb in size just like Bitcoin.
- Total capacity is 4 times Bitcoin because 4 blocks occur in a 10 minute  period.
- If they implement segwit that will be close to 8 times the capacity.
- Full blocks would likely not wipe out most of the network at 1Mb size and 2.5 minute intervals.
- The number of nodes being reduced has something to do with 
mining difficulty, electrical costs, fewer individual miners and the death of solo mining. Suggesting that the drop is solely because of data transfer costs is somewhat disingenuous. 
- If blocks were full the LTC network would likely be larger because full blocks would indicate greater adoption and a larger Market Cap.

ATL was in February of 2013, not today, likely not anytime soon either. I don't mind you knocking LTC or BTC for that matter but, do try to be factual.

LTC incorporates the best BTC code and adds modifications that improves things. In fact every BTC developer is indirectly a LTC developer. So how is the BTC project any better? When the developers are for the most part the same ones?

The greater Vancouver area 2.7 million people, the greater Toronto area 9.2 million people, Canada 36 million, these "unique" areas contain about 1/3 of the entire population so not to be so easily dismissed. Even where I live in London, Ontario a small quantity of houses are purchased by foreigners and stay empty. Not dismissing your claim that housing prices in Canada are due for a correction; but, definitely foreign buyers have affected housing prices in Canada.

That's odd. If the foreign buyers were not influencing the market then why the BC government and Ontario government step in and impose taxes on foreign buyers? Definitely contact your local MPP and explain the errors of their ways.

Actually nothing was agreed to at the round table that wasn't already being considered for future versions of LTC if needed. Jihan got nothing really, that's what is most amusing about the process. Politics and art merge sometimes.

Good point. It will cost more than internet access for the month.

The article is about one billion people being able to access the internet for free initially (until the end of 2016) and then paying as little as 149 rupees ($2.25) a month for data after that.
While many in India do not currently have a bank account (women in particular) many do. To suggest that the article means there are 1 billion unbanked people in India is misleading. Also some of that one billion currently have internet access through other providers.
Exciting news for India; but, your statement is misleading.

Well LTC can already handle 8 times as many transactions as BTC so demand would have to be a lot higher. And don't worry your drug dealer is already getting pissed at high fees cutting into his profit and is looking for an alternative.
