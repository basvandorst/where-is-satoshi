i also presume that i don't have complete information so its likely that there are ways to know that i don't know

 seems to allow landlords with accounts to accept bitcoin for payment and converts it to fiat for them.

Sigh... I remember when I spent my first dollar on Bitcoin and it bought almost 2.5 bitcoins... 
The times they are a changin'

still not relevant.  the 2 are related, but not that directly.
hfutrell has the right idea, but it's not the analogy isnt:
coinbase &lt;-&gt; bitcoin   ==   apple &lt;-&gt; **money supply**
it's more accurate to think of that as:
coinbase  &lt;-&gt; bitcoin  ==  apple &lt;-&gt; **amount of minted of US currency**
This is an important distinction because the money supply is much larger than the [monetary base]( and flexes according to reserve rates and usage.
So in short, even if there was only 1 bitcoin in the entire economy, daily bitcoin usage could be millions of bitcoins, provided the velocity of money was sufficiently high (i buy something from you, you buy something from someone else, etc so the same coin can be spent repeatedly).
the value of the bitcoin companies is more likely tied to the size of the bitcoin economy.
on the flip side, imagine that the for wahtever reason 21mm bitcoins had already been issued and they were worth 1 dollar each.  this doesn't imply a maximum market value of 21 million for the aggregate of all companies that participate in the bitcoin economy.
case 1: bitcoins are just collector items that people save on their flash drives as a reminder of a time when we thought it was a good idea -- value of bitcoin companies --&gt; probably way less than 21mm (thats what all bitcoins are worth in aggregate, but if they never change hands, there's no business and the companies can't be worth much).
case 2: bitcoins are *the* global currency and there's a healthy economy with lots of lending and an average (self regulated) reserve ratio  of 0.1% so an implied money supply of 21 billion, and since it's the one global currency.
In either case, the value of companies that use/are related to/vend bitcoin can be 100% decoupled from the FX value of all bitcoins to &lt;anythign else&gt;

Uh what?
**1. Bitcoin growth is inevitable**
Don't conflate "good" or "beneficial" things with "inevitable dominance".
History is littered with better ideas that failed.
**2. Hyper growth will be rapid**
Even *if*  is true,  does not follow.
Bitcoin has a lot of advantages, but it also has disadvantages (like perception, adoption, uncertain political future, trust).
Overstating the case is BAD for Bitcoin. 
I know you mean well but assertions like these come off as merely talking your book and a thinly masked attempt to impact adoption without the substance to back up claims.

I understand that there are reasons why anonymity is valuable and I don't think that's in dispute.
Hopefully we can also generally appreciate that there are reasons why it would be valuable to estimate size of bitcoin economy outside of speculative transactions (posted exchange transaction notional).
Basically there is evidence that the Bitcoin economy for real world things is growing with new merchants and such.  A lot of these people don't care about the privacy/anonymity attributes of Bitcoin as a currency.

(fwiw, if this disclosure is even necessary, my background is in traditional finance, i've been in bitcoin since about $.35 and I'm interested in moving towards regulated, transparent Bitcoin infrastructure -- so ways to estimate the size of the economy that is actually taking "market share" from fiat is interesting to me)

I was reading this and getting really into it, then about 3/4 down the page I had a horrible suspicion that I was going to get shittymorphed at the very end...
