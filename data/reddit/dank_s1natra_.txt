Do you have a c43? Maybe you’re confusing this with a c63?What do you drive?
@_date: 2018-12-08 18:36:25
Duuuude I’m fucking dying �������������� awesome!!
@_date: 2018-12-12 13:21:45
That’s what I thought, everyone thinks it’s a 63 ����‍♂️

Amg badges on a non amg car. Unless this dudes is fake then cool, but the c43 is exactly like that. I asked what you drove because I figured you’re so sure you’ve probabaly owned one.

What do we get taxed here??��

There’s more than one option you need to look at what the minimum is it says on the user you click on “min 10$” or something like that. There’s also atms but they’re high fees too

More like 5,00000000,00000000,00000000 I’m not even really sure if the amount of zeros in between the commas are the same.. but this is my price prediction ����
