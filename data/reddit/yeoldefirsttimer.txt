Yeah I know lmao, I’m pretty sure it’s not even possible to have an expansion valve that will cool the working fluid to a temperature low enough since T_hot is so low, the whole thing is silly, but it doesn’t hurt to dream��

Ok hear me out, counterflow heat exchanger between water, which is in direct contact with the source of heat, acting as a boiler of sorts, and the working fluid could be like Freon. This heated Freon powers a miniature tabletop turbine, attached to a small DC-AC generator, a la electricity. The Freon could then go through an expansion valve, and then pumped back into the boiler. 
Voila, literally a perfect thermodynamic cycle 
/s 
or is it?

Nah he's not scum because he's republican, he's just scum. He 100% defended Trump and his ridiculously racist bullshit he tweeted out the other day. It's great that he's a proponent for bitcoin and blockchain, don't get me wrong, but *just* because he supports btc and blockchain doesn't make him an angel either
He's the friend in a high place that we need, but not the one that we want

All of this just makes me sad I didn’t buy more when it was at the mid-$3000 mark :’(

My favorite cousin is named Ivan, he’s kinda *out there* and back in like ‘09 (I was in middle school, he just graduated high school) he couldn’t stop telling me about the brand new Tesla sport car prototype, Bitcoin, and the Zeitgeist movement that was in full swing at the time
He kept going on and on about this new internet currency that’s gonna revolutionize the world and that I should buy a few bitcoins and I’m sitting there like, dude I’m 12 wtf are you talking about...
Anyway, I think that skeleton you’re talking about is my cousin

Didn’t he account for like 1% of the TOTAL losses in the United States one year?
I mean, with stats like that, he’s literally *the best* at losing money

Lmao I made this post when it was at $12.3k, I just saw that it fell even more
Welp that just means I have more buying power

My cousin was into Bitcoin back in ‘09, I should probably hit him up one of these days and see what he did with it lol
But yeah 1 btc is what I’m shooting for. I’d like to reach that amount before next year but we’ll see. Once I reach 1 whole Bitcoin then I’d feel comfortable just sitting back knowing I have that powerful asset. I’d still buy more, just not at the anxiety-inducing pace that I am right now lmao
