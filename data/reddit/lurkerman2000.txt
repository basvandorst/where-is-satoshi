They don't have free access to bitcoin either someone needs to be on the other side of that transaction who the fuck do you think that is.
Think about that in your own terms as well who in their right mind is going to give Bitcoin to someone for a currency that they desperately want to get rid of as they have no faith in it and it continues to lose value at an accelerated pace. Seriously who do you think that is?

No it isn't.  Anyone that bought BTC in the last 12 months has lost money.  That is NOT an 'excellent' store of value.

Attitudes like this are exactly why it&amp; a speculative investment at best. Currency needs to be used in order to be economically viable. That viability is what you ultimately are contending for.

If that's the perspective you are engaged with  you either live in the third world or you are a fucking lunatic

I think you're confusing gambling addiction with casually playing the lottery

So that's why pawn shops are always looking to buy gold

Which is also a bad narrative that's been beaten to death by the fact that it can't hold value

I completely agreed with until you went into the fundamental reason for centralization. He had that correct. You will never replicate any of the services that he specifically cites without a shit ton of money and resources. You know who has a shit ton of money and resources? Big fucking companies.
By the way, they all started in the same place.  They built some shity version of what they are now, and investors decided to pool their money because they knew that would be a great idea. Centralization doesn't come just from the government it comes from us in every way.  Our investment and consumption fuel centralization

We're fucking 10 years past the financial crisis of 2008 and you still say shit like 'it was caused by the Banks'.  How is it possible that you have learned fucking nothing over the past 10 years

Profitable because of what.  It either has utility or it doesnt.  Its utility for a select group of people (largely criminals) is the only reason it has a value &gt; 0.  What you have all borne witness to is rampant speculation and malinvestment.  As the yield cirve flattens  malinvestment wanes.  Welcome to basic economics, the hard way
