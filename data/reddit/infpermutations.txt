The real issue there will be how do you roll out new versions/features to all these embedded mining nodes which are shipped with other devices?
We'll have nodes running old versions for a long time. If you have auto updates, whoever is pushing out these updates in effect has control over these nodes and which versions they run. It's not really decentralisation.

If every cable box and router had an ASIC, I reckon around 1% of users would care or know how to point their inbuilt bitcoin miner at a mining pool. As it stands right now, whether this changes as time progresses I'm not sure. 
Most people don't touch their routers at the moment, for anything. Grab the wireless key from the bottom of the router, plug it in and away you go. 
@_date: 2016-04-16 15:08:13
Yep, looks fine now. 
@_date: 2016-04-02 19:15:51
It depends which nodes you are connected to. Perhaps the nodes you are connected to have already downloaded the full blockchain and so you are just relaying transactions and new blocks as they reach you. 
If your router supports UPNP you should still be able to connect to more than 8 nodes without having to use port forwarding. 
@_date: 2016-03-25 18:28:58
It's not really an extraordinary claim. Capitalism will always lead to the formation of monopolies. The reason why there is no monopoly on capital is because we had to put laws in place to prevent them from being created. 
It's worse within the Lightning network due to how the routes will be transparently chosen by software. The cheapest and fastest route will always be chosen. At least in the real world, people have the choice to not do business with a monopoly, and to seek out smaller more innovative entities. 
The way the LN is currently envisaged, you would expect one large entity to form and dominate quite quickly.  
@_date: 2016-03-25 17:44:15
You didn't address my concern about centralisation. The way the Lightening network is envisaged will lead to large central hubs (maybe just one), offering low fees with many channels to other entities. 
What's to prevent this monopoly? 
@_date: 2016-03-25 11:20:05
You mean like sending a transaction right now is just.... one transaction on the blockchain? Why would you bother opening and closing a channel in the same transaction when you can just.... send a transaction as you do now?
I can see how allowing two large organisations to transact with each other via their own channel in a formal way will, will reduce transactions directly on the blockchain. There is already an example of that [here]( no lightning network required. 
However for the regular man in the street who is going out on a shopping trip, moving from store to store, he doesn't want to worry about pre allocating coins in a channel, he just wants to transact. Apparently this will be hidden from the user, but I fail to see how this will work. I decision needs to be made about how much to pre allocate in the channel, and how likely is it that the channel will be used again for there to be any benefit of reducing the amount of space on the blockchain. If clients are overzealous creating these channels in some automated way, we could end up with more bloat on the blockchain when eventually they have to be closed as the funds are required for a new transaction or for the creation of a new channel. 
Another way would be if everyone created a channel with the same intermediary and preallocated funds. In this way only one channel would be required for each person with the central entity. You would then transact through this intermediary. According to [this]( , nodes on the lightning network will charge to relay transactions:


So you could well see that some kind of central entity will emerge which by using economies of scale can charge the lowest fees,  reduce the number of channels required and therefore attract more customers.  
This is not decentralisation however. 
 
@_date: 2016-03-25 17:54:56
Which leads to the problem of centralisation. Eventually by economies of scale and by the number of open channels to other entities, you will end up with one large central hub which can charge the lowest fees and which is also the best connected to other entities. 
What will prevent this from occurring?
Edit, to quote you:


Which means end users won't even get a choice of which route through the Lightening network they will use, it will happen transparently. Therefore I assume the lowest fee route will be chosen. A large centralised hub is not only inevitable it will happen quite quickly.  
@_date: 2016-03-26 12:20:07
So if we follow this through logically, over time, Internet speeds in developing countries will improve. Should the blocksize then increase , given that we can still support these users?
@_date: 2016-03-26 22:23:20




There will be fees, see page 49 [here]( 


No one will be required to use a hub, but no one will be choosing which hubs to use as the route which is chosen will be [transparent]( to end users. A monopoly will quickly develop so that there is likely to be one large central hub, which can offer the lowest fees by having the greatest connectivity to other nodes. 
This raises centralisation issues and also appears to create a central point of failure. See page [46]( and also page 51 which deals with data loss and the stealing of funds. 
On page 48 we have the following:


lot like the correspondent banking network, or Tier-1 ISPs. Similar to how
packets still reach their destination on your home network connection, not
all participants need to have a full routing table.
I'm not quite sure you can compare the internet with the lightening network. On the internet, you cannot set up a direct connection, as in a one hop connection to any with anyone you please, you have to choose the lowest latency path which is available. 
Within the Lightening network, if a channel already exists, it will be used and the one with the lowest fee will be chosen. Leading to one central hub.

This is wrong, with the lightening network there are time limits in place, if you lose data and don't recover it in time you can lose funds.

What are your thoughts then on how he foresaw Bitcoin scaling? Given that he said it can already scale. Which suggests no change in the protocol.

One thing MTGox did have going for it was a good websocket interface. 
@_date: 2016-03-26 19:25:44
I don't think many of us years ago really foreseen any of this as a risk. What's really made it all possible is the centralisation of miners via pool operators, which was exacerbated by the development of asic's. 
It appears we really need to develop multiple competing implementations along side each other, which develop the protocol together moving forwards. 
For an example of how this currently works in tech, look at DNS, SMTP and the development of [DMARC]( Many competing companies (AOL, Comcast, Google, Yahoo, Microsoft etc) have worked together to develop and extend an existing protocol to solve a problem. 
I think eventually this is how Bitcoin will evolve, no single group will control how the protocol develops. 
@_date: 2016-03-21 21:57:09
With pruned nodes, the barrier for entry is already fairly low. 
@_date: 2016-03-30 19:22:20
Remember way back? When you first heard about Bitcoin and almost instantly with very little thought required, you could see it was a very elegant solution. It's almost as if there is a platonic quality surrounding Bitcoin as it was originally conceived. As if the idea was always out there, waiting for someone to discover it and present it to the world. 
The more you think about Bitcoin, the more you understand the nuances, the more perfect it seems. 
Unfortunately the Lightning Network is the complete opposite of this. The more you think about it, the more complicated it seems and it just feels like a bit of a fudge. You can see how many the complexities of the Lightning Network are being discussed on the [mailing list]( If you only read what was posted here in this subreddit you would think it's just around the corner and about to be released.  
The Lightning Network first needs to be developed, tested and proved to be secure. Until then I think many people are rightly sceptical that we should pin all our hopes of scalability on this one idea.

@_date: 2016-03-25 11:28:23
This only works however if you send more than one transaction to the same entity while the channel is open, and you also have to decide how much of your funds want to "set aside" and store in this channel, and for how long. 
If you only send one payment using this channel whilst it is open, you have used more space on the blockchain than you would have done so by just sending the payment in the first place. 
@_date: 2016-03-21 07:04:12
Smaller how? I'd say it was bigger back then. More independent miners. Now you just have to talk to the folks who operate the mining pools. 
@_date: 2016-03-26 22:53:37


It's back and white in the white paper:


You said:


As I have mentioned, people will not be directly choosing which path their transactions take through the lightning network, your client will take care of this for you. Much like you don't choose which nodes to relay to now when you broadcast a transaction. 
The difference is currently, it doesn't really matter who you broadcast the transaction to as there are no fees involved when broadcasting. As fees will be involved with Lightening, you software will automatically select the lowest cost path (lowest fee). 
You also don't have to worry about counter party risk, or the pre allocation and "locking" up of your funds until some time in the future when you decide to either spend them all in the channel or close the channel down. 
@_date: 2016-03-26 19:35:31
Good argument for why we shouldn't have a "core" implementation to begin with if we want decentralisation. 
@_date: 2016-03-25 23:09:34
No, not at all. The supply is not affected at all and completely unrelated, well, perhaps it affects your own personal supply as you have to send more in the form of a fee. 
Large transactions take up more space in a block. There is only limited space available, 1MB, so a miner has to prioritize which transactions they include. They earn money from the block reward ( currently 25 btc) plus fees. So they have an incentive to include as many transactions as they can fit in the block for the highest fee.  
 
@_date: 2016-03-25 11:32:09
You mean then like a central entity to which everyone has channels open with? Who by economies of scale can charge the lowest fees, and also reduce the number of channels people are required to create?
Sounds very much like centralisation to me. Forgive me, but I assumed we wanted to move away from such a situation.  
@_date: 2016-03-26 07:49:14
Yep, that's possible. Except you would at the time you draw up the contract have to allocate the funds up front to cover the period in question. Now as people have said, you can exit the channel when you want, but that seems kind of pointless when you are paying for an on going monthly service. 
In this case I guess it might be easier to just pay them up front for the whole period without having to worry about the complexity of keeping  a channel open. 
@_date: 2016-03-30 15:21:34
Imagine a company employing a significant proportion of the most influential developers of an opensource project in order to gain influence over said project.
Would that also be considered a bribe attack?
@_date: 2016-03-26 11:32:04
Perhaps then the blocksize should actually be lowered to support users on 56k modems in developing countries. 
@_date: 2016-03-25 08:54:05
From the Lightning network website 


So I assume at the point the channel is created, they have to sign off how much funds they want to sign off on? Or is it an unlimited amount? I assume that you have to prove you actually have the funds available, which are then held in a sort of escrow. 
@_date: 2016-03-25 09:19:26
If then I just want to open a channel each time I can't reach someone, then what problem are we solving here? Each time this will have to be recorded onto the blockchain, and I assume that these ledger entries are actually larger than regular transactions. 
From [here](


represented as an entry on the bitcoin public ledger. In order to spend funds from the channel, both parties must agree
on the new balance. The current balance is stored as the most recent transaction signed by both parties, spending
from the channel address. To make a payment, both parties sign a new exit transaction spending from the channel
address. All old exit transactions are invalidated by doing so. 
Again - 


Funds are placed into an address, which implies they are held there until the channel closes. Which I assume can be a long period of time (days?, weeks?) because if it cannot be, then you will be writing to the blockchain just as much as you do now. 
You are correct that currently with the blockchain you sign off on more funds than you are sending, but the difference is that currently you immediately allocate the change to a different address. With the Lightning network the funds need to be held in escrow for a long period of time so the channel can remain open. 
@_date: 2016-03-25 09:22:32
Please explain how you will be able to reach someone without opening a new channel. If I have never transacted with someone before, how will a channel exist?
@_date: 2016-03-26 23:19:00
Well it's a pretty big problem if you lose the data minutes before you need to send it. And how about if you forget or wasn't able to get online in time? This is adding to the complicity of this new solution. What happens when a block re org occurs? Do you need to re transmit ? What if you don't retransmit in time? What if there is a large backlog of transactions waiting to enter the blockchain?
@_date: 2016-03-21 20:50:51
Quoting you in your linked post (my bold):


That's a big IF. According to this paper [here]( we could increase the current blocksize to 38MB and 50% of the current nodes would be able to keep up. 


should not exceed 4MB for X=90%; and 38MB for X=50%.
90% can handle 4MB. 
Bigger blocks would allow for more transactions, more transactions would attract more users and you would expect this would bring more nodes. 
@_date: 2016-03-26 19:14:41


So this is an interesting question regarding the Lightening Network how the network itself will look over time. So as we know, to make a payment using the Lightening network, you open a channel and pre allocate funds to that channel. Apparently this will all be [transparent]( to end users.  
When you send a transaction over the channel, you will have to pay a small fee. Now rather than having to open channels to every new entity you wish to pay, existing channels will be used. 
Therefore, you would expect a client to automatically chose a path through the network which results in the lowest fee, via the fastest route. 
From this, you would expect a large entity to form which is able to charge the lowest fees and has existing channels open to many entities. It's difficult for other "hubs" to compete with this model as there is nothing intrinsic within the network they can offer over the central hub to compete, only the fee and the number of hops in a channel is important.
It seems fairly obvious that a large central entity will emerge, and it will probably happen quite quickly. 
 
@_date: 2016-03-25 22:58:48
It's probably due to the size of the transaction. If it has many inputs, the transaction size will be quite large. The priority of a transaction is based on its size and fee. By default the minimum fee for a transaction to be considered non free is  is 0.00001 btc per kb.  Your wallet might be trying to ensure you get into the blockchain within say... 3 blocks, or less. You could try setting a lower fee and seeing if it goes through. At the moment the network does not appear to have a significant backlog. 
@_date: 2016-03-25 09:55:54
How is this saving space on the blockchain? Sounds like more transactions occur on the blockchain than there would do currently. All this closing and opening of channels has an overhead. Unless you want to tie up a significant amount of funds each time you open a channel, you will be opening and closing them quite frequently. 
As I said above, its pre payment for micro transactions. At the point a user creates a channel, he will need to decide how much he wants to allocate. For most people, we do not currently transact in this way. 
@_date: 2017-01-23 18:08:54
He doesn't, you can read his response on his user page or in the "other place". 
@_date: 2017-01-26 06:17:25
It mentions nothing about how they will prevent a central hub from forming which offers the lowest fees and the shortest path through the network as it has channels open with everyone. This is from the dev blog you mentioned and is the only aspect of the document which touches on routing :


So one central hub by economies of scale will be able to offer close to zero fees, and shortest path. Minimising the cumulative time-lock. As your node will automatically route, we will naturally move towards one central hub very quickly. 
There is much talk of the privacy of internode communication in the blog, however nodes themselves or the one central hub which will emerge will be able to see what payments are going where. 
So as a decentralised private payment mechanism it falls well short.
@_date: 2017-01-25 21:20:38


Unfortunately when the way forward cannot be agreed on, this is the only way we can move forward, by using the very mechanism Bitcoin provides. A decentralised trustless consensus. Not by voting on pull requests. 
This is the way Bitcoin was designed to work, it is fundamental concept of the protocol. 
@_date: 2017-01-23 18:19:25
It's one of the initial parameters of Bitcoin ( interesting to note that originally there was no blocksize limit, only a message limitation of 32MB). 
However like most things in Bitcoin, this could conceivably be changed by a fork. I would never support this change though, and I doubt you could ever get the community to go along with it. 
Central properties would be more abstract, such as a distributed public ledger , of which the contents is determined by trustless consensus, PoW , a "Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System" and no double spending of balances. 
@_date: 2017-01-25 20:29:10
I'd prefer this parameter to be taken away from developers and allow miners to naturally find the right sweet spot. Blocks which are too large for the network to handle will be orphaned, this will impact the miners in their back pocket. 
They have an incentive to be cautious.
If we increase to 2mb, we'll be back here in a year arguing again about the same thing. 
@_date: 2017-01-25 20:25:54


With respect, it's not as though the lightning network is available, ready to be deployed. It's still heavily in development. Many teams are working on it, yet there is no working version at the moment. No one has yet managed to solve the routing issue. 
@_date: 2017-01-25 21:01:59


Yes, they are.... At least with the current most popular client. There is no way to manually configure this value without recompiling from source (apart from if you want to lower the value). 
If anything is centralised at the moment, its that we rely on one client implementation, where commit access is in the hands of a few people. 
Multiple implementations should be encouraged, so they can be allowed to compete. Competition is the lifeblood of progress. We've already seen the benefits of this with Xthin blocks. 
@_date: 2016-10-24 08:36:26
Yes there are others. People should support them to further decentralisation. 
@_date: 2016-10-24 07:37:15
This is the correct response. The only risk of centralisation we have at the moment is with a single reference implementation which controls all development of the protocol and leads to stagnation. Similar to when internet explorer 6 ruled the web.

The longest chain with the most proof of work is the only measure of legitimacy in Bitcoin. 
Whether you agree with the rules the longest chain is following is completely irrelevant. 
I suggest you lobby core to get them to modify their segwit activation threshold to 100% else they are attacking the network, in your view. 
@_date: 2016-10-24 07:58:24
The simple facts are...
* Technology improves over time for everyone on the planet 
* We want Bitcoin to grow
Combine both of those things and the only sane conclusion is that we should allow the blockchain to steadily grow over time. 
Furthermore we know that miners and node operators will chose sane parameter values for their nodes, they do this already. Miners will not risk generating blocks which will not propagate across the network as this will cost them. 
Therefore you would likely see the blocksize grow over time but the rate of growth would be very conservative. 
@_date: 2016-10-28 19:47:57
Ok... so for anyone interested the [webpage]( said the following:










































So if that's not true, what did Satoshi say about payment channels?
@_date: 2016-10-24 07:33:06
Core is focussed on centralisation of development. Having a number of different implementations of the protocol is a good thing. 
Remember back when the web was ruled by internet explorer? The web stagnated for a while. The exact same thing has happened with Bitcoin. 
People should support multiple implementations to further the decentralization of the whole ecosystem.
I don't go along with this view that larger blocks will mean centralisation as we know technology is continuously improving. Miners will not produce blocks which run the risk of propagating too slowly as they risk losing out economically.
The network should be allowed to naturally reach a consensus on the block size, in the manner it was designed to operate.
@_date: 2016-10-28 17:25:31

Is 100% accurate. 
@_date: 2016-10-24 09:56:11


Unfortunately not, have you heard of the 51% attack?


Over the last 1000 blocks, BU signalled blocks account for 11% of all blocks mined. Slightly more than 5%.  
Core came up with the 95% activation rule for SegWit, no one else. If you don't like it, take it up with them. 
I'm intrigued though, what do you think it should be? I assume 100%, right?
@_date: 2016-10-20 06:10:32
It's straight forward really, economics 101, supply and demand. There are people complaining about $0.20 transactions. If you increase the supply, in this case more block space, the transaction fee will fall. 
@_date: 2016-10-26 11:50:17


How is that not centralization?
@_date: 2016-10-16 12:33:31
You are absolutely right. Any fork will be lead by the miners and node operators. 
At which point I hope this blocksize debate will be settled forever and we return to what was originally envisaged, miners and nodes reaching a consensus. 
Not by voting on pull requests. 
@_date: 2016-10-28 19:04:11
Well we clearly haven't gotten anywhere near what he intended Bitcoin to scale to. 


Based on what he said, it's reasonable to conclude he thought Bitcoin could scale without much modification to the specification, only the running parameters. 
He even proposes the means of modifying this parameter. 




The network hasn't change that much in 6 years really, asic mining being the biggest change. Unfortunately since he left it's not been allowed to scale. 
@_date: 2016-10-24 11:23:26
95% is not 100%. 
By your definition, it's an attack. 
@_date: 2016-10-24 12:48:18
Yes but should only one implementation be allowed to propose changes to the protocol?
As long as Bitcoin exists in its current form there will be disagreement over what the protocol should look like. The only way to resolve this each time will be via nakamoto consensus. Not via voting on pull requests submitted to one central repository. 
@_date: 2016-10-20 06:22:47
No you have not lost them. Worse case you will have to resend the transaction if it doesn't get included in a block at some point. You could try rebroadcasting the transaction with a higher fee but this isn't straightforward. 
People should support a higher block size cap to ease this incidents in the future. This will only get worse over time. 
@_date: 2016-10-24 10:13:48


Right.... which is exactly what would happen in the case of a miner broadcasting a block which 70% of the network validated as correct. 
I'm confused as to what you think you have disproved. 
I asked what you think the activation rule of SegWit should be. Again, I assume you think this should be 100%. Else this is an attack on the network, correct?

The mailing list is subject to moderation however, and therefore what can be discussed, similar to what code is committed to the Core client, is under the control of a small number of people who hold power. 
So on the one hand you claim to support the decentralisation of mining, but you are more than happy to support the centralisation of Bitcoin development. 
@_date: 2016-10-24 14:58:50


Yes, this is true. Which is why any miner who is able to control more than 51% (nevermind 70%) of the network is able to attack the network for their own gain. If any one miner manages to gain 51% of the network hash rate, you will have more things than just the blocksize to be concerned about. 


Why exactly? This runs the risk of orphaned blocks, should the 40% of miners who didn't received the block then find more blocks because of variance, then the block will be orphaned. They will have lost their block reward. They do not want to risk this which is why they participate in the [blockrelaynetwork]( This reduces the orphan block rate. 
So my statement: 


Still holds true, and the existence of the relay network proves this. Miners work together to ensure their blocks reach other miners as quickly as possible. 


I'm sorry but this is absolutely garbage. Bitcoin operates by majority rule. Take a look what it says in the Bitcoin white paper. 




valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on
them. 
Also, lets see what the man himself [said]( about raising the blocksize limit:


Not only is he not suggesting this is an attack on the network, he is proposing how it can be done. So on the one hand we have a very simple method to increase capacity, recommend by Satoshi himself, and on the other hand we have a complicated over engineered fudge built on an anyonecanspend hack.

I think you are right. What is important is trust, when it comes to building consensus.

If we are going to hard fork in this way, why not hard fork to asic resistant mining protocol? This would help decentralisation more than anything. Which is the basis of this hard fork in question.
If the protocol is to be changed in this way, it seems like it's just designed to protect exiting miners and maintain the status quo, which you could argue is fairly centralised. Having a few people get together in Hong Kong to make decisions on future protocol changes is not my idea of decentralisation. 
I accept miners have made investments, I guess the current lifetime of these investments can be measured in years as they soon become obsolete. Therefore the fork to a new PoW protocol could be scheduled in for a few years time. 
Bring back mining to everyone in the way it was originally designed.

April 2009, I edited my post. 


Now who is putting words into people's mouths? Can you back this up with a quote?
@_date: 2016-05-24 05:55:05
Well there is the whole idea of doing something the easy way, or the complicated hard hacky way. 
Both achieve the same result. I know which I prefer.

So looking at this then, before Craig asked for the 3 donations to be sent, there was already around 18btc remaining in that address. It's not like there was nothing in that account to play with, if by some chance he did have the private key to that address, he could have moved some coins to demonstrate he had access to the key. I don't understand the need to move coins into the address before sending them back. It's all rather surreal. 
Obviously the easiest method would have been to just sign a message with the key, no need to move coins. 
@_date: 2016-10-24 15:05:19
So according to you computing has not moved on in 10 years?

This is how Bitcoin is designed to operate. Should 30% of the network hold 70% of it back?
This is Nakamoto consensus. 
@_date: 2016-05-24 05:50:44
Better to release segwit in a non hacky way first time round imho. 
Always keep it simple. 
@_date: 2016-05-03 15:25:35
Now steady on there, you're not allowed to use reason and rational thought in all this. 
@_date: 2016-05-05 18:57:39
Well, he can't actually get access to the £15, unless.... he is Satoshi. 
@_date: 2016-05-23 17:20:41
I think there are a significant number of people who would like bigger blocks who are not miners, who want to see Bitcoin succeed and grow. 
@_date: 2016-05-20 19:53:47
There is an artificial limit in place which is resulting in difficulties for users, right now. What do we do? Rather than attempting to solve this problem. We expect novice users to instinctively know the correct fee to use, when even the developers of their clients have found it difficult to code their apps to generate adequate fees based on the generated transaction size; taking into account of the current state of the mempool. 
When most of us first started using Bitcoin, 0 fee transactions were a thing. It might have taken longer to get your transaction in a block but it did eventually work. 
Let's get back to that, let's support all users. Whilst at the same time let's allow the development of scalable, off chain solutions for end users who require large scale fast confirming transactions. These are not mutually exclusive.

So how will the asicboost mitigation work then? It's going to take too long as a hard fork?
@_date: 2016-05-18 15:23:34
I thought the narrative had already shifted and we needed a hard fork to mitigate asicboost? 
If we are going to hard fork for that, may as well hard fork segwit and even put the increase to 2mb whist we are hard forking. 
@_date: 2016-05-15 17:42:17
Yes I don't understand this part either. How can the mining algorithm be changed to prevent the use of asicboost but not affect exisiting asics?
@_date: 2016-10-24 08:11:54


You misunderstand me, I am not saying there should only one implementation. There should be multiple. 
@_date: 2016-05-25 15:51:38
So if they are ignoring users and miners, in who's interest are they working for?
@_date: 2016-05-12 20:18:23
Whilst I appreciate the sentiment behind this, Bitcoin differs to other opensource projects in a big way. Everyone who owns Bitcoin is a shareholder in the project. We, the people, give Bitcoin its value. 
@_date: 2016-05-02 07:34:00
I was just providing details of what was in the article..... Not sure why they haven't made this proof public. 
@_date: 2016-05-20 06:37:34
Can you tell us where you stand in this?
@_date: 2016-05-20 05:57:51
I was under the impression we now needed a hard fork to address the asicboost patent issue?
@_date: 2016-05-20 19:38:07
Apparently we are not allowed to complain unless we have submitted a pull request to bitcoin core :/
Personally I'd prefer the free market, hence miners to decide how big a block they wish to attempt to mine. Larger blocks, longer to generate, longer to confirm(but more income from fees), risk someone will mine a smaller block in the mean time and propagate it over the network. 
If we had this, I'd be more open to other initiatives such as the Lightning network and segwit ( as a hard fork for simplicity). Let end users and miners decide how they want to generate blocks and transact. 
@_date: 2016-05-06 05:19:25
Hmmm, I see. Thanks for responding I hadn't heard that one! 
@_date: 2016-05-06 05:49:58
Thanks for posting this!

This is from the economist article:


So I wonder why only block 9?
@_date: 2016-05-12 21:05:42
I would never advocate harassment. That's not really the point I was making. 
I think the community has more of a say in Bitcoin which differs to other opensource projects, given the way the consensus protocol works.
The project could continue with the same name, but not make use of the current "core" implementation. With other projects, you can fork the software, but you have to change the name. This is not the case with Bitcoin, if you can convince the majority to follow. 
@_date: 2016-05-20 09:20:28
Thanks for sharing your thoughts, much appreciated. 
@_date: 2016-05-24 05:45:45
Gmax is against it though. 
@_date: 2016-10-28 18:32:08
How about this quote from Satoshi? This is from back in 2009, I think it's clear he thought Bitcoin, in the form it existed back in 2009, could scale on chain. 
































We don't need to put words into his mouth, we can go back to look at what he said. 
Edit - [link]( for those interested. 
@_date: 2016-05-16 05:16:14
Thank you!
@_date: 2016-05-23 17:50:46
I think it was more about trying to build consensus. 
Something Luke has also been trying to do recently, in an effort stick to the agreement he signed up to in Hong Kong. 
@_date: 2016-05-11 17:21:15
Just something to note, Craig Wright's website has recently been updated and now just shows a blank white screen. 
@_date: 2016-05-25 15:55:11
Which is used by?
@_date: 2016-05-23 15:29:42
To be fair he didn't just pick on Peter. He said :


Didn't Adam and Luke attend as well?
