Mining on Mars or other planets would also decentralize the whole system even more.
Even a nuclear war on just one planet could not bring the system down in that case.
Maybe mining on some cooler planets like Uranus would even be much more efficient.

Never ending debate...
Open source vs, closed source...
Decentralization vs. centralization...
Since I am no IT expert myself I trust thousands of „decentralized“ individuals who understand the code behind the Trezor wallet more than a „centralized“ small group of individuals writing some secret code for the Ledger wallet.
Since BTC itself is 100% transparent, open source and decentralized I go with the Trezor.
