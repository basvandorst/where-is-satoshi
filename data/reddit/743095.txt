yes but BTC would work because if the addresses are known then its not anonymous, 
imagine all taxes go to 1 address (controlled by the gov) we could see who has been paid i.e  gov pays health service (NHS) then NHS pays doctor, nurses and suppliers (all publicly known addresses) then NHS pays unknown address..... this would need to be accounted for, thus making the addresses owner know or the payment would be un accounted for and considered theft. as long as this is public info, anyone can check the accounts

if your from the future, you would have known this before today

explain that what they think is money is just a bit of paper, a note from the bank..... a promise from the bank to one day give you money.... but all you ever get is another bit of paper
@_date: 2019-03-15 12:18:21
not if it was gov fund as all the addresses would be public. so you could trace the tax you pay. and watch the money move to each department. all funds in and out would be publicly viewed. and we could see who the money is going to and it could be accounted for (if funds go to an unknown address that would be theft as it is not accounted for)

Millenials! when i was a boy we had this thing called 'cash'. we never left the house without it, and if we were going to by a car, we would take just the right amount (maybe a little less if i thought i could get away with it)

withdraw what? btc from bisq....yes
but you want to sell your btc to another in exchange for a payment into your bank
@_date: 2019-03-07 11:46:47
your dad will use btc when he needs to
BTC is for anyone, fiat is for those that do as they are told and obey the powers that be.
if you dad ever has trouble with the government (of any country) and is restricted from using fiat (bank and payment processors) he can still buy his coffee and pay bills.

I was travelling last summer when i used it, i was just going to change some money at the currency exchange across the road when i saw it.
@_date: 2019-03-15 10:44:58
they can print all they want, they will never have enough to convince me that paper is better than BTC.
also as they print they produce inflation, and as the prices of everything rise ppl try to get rid of the paper money ASAP, at some point it becomes worthless and nobody wants it no matter how much they print thus loosing their power to print money. this is currently happening in Venezuela. Government issued money/notes/paper has no value

use localbitcoins and trade for cash its so much easier
@_date: 2019-03-02 09:40:29
when it happened to me i wrote the bank a letter, outlining my fees and the percentage of interest i required on the funds that they had taken. They quickly paid it back to me with interest.
basically the banks cant take or hold your funds without facts and evidence of a crime, so when they do, accept it as 'they needed a loan' and apply fees and interest.
so your first action is to write a legal sounding letter (i lernt off youtube ) that state how THEY can fix this issue without YOU taking them to court

ive never had an issue with it, i dont tell everyone when im doing it. and its better than asking the bank for permission to make a payment
@_date: 2019-03-10 23:35:47
you are the scammer! any normal person would just walk in to your bank and withdraw the money and buy bitcoin.

this is dumb. HODL is a long term strategy. if you spend your coins you are most likely sending to someone that will sell for $ thus forcing the price down
