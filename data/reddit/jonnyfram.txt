Hello Reddit,
This is not meant to be a sob story, I am posting this in order to help out a genuinely good person that is really down on his luck.
DobZombie (of bitcointalk, Andrew Dobbins) a person that has donated his bone marrow for a life saving procedure to a complete stranger halfway around the world asking nothing in return. How many people do you know that would do this?
Please check out the newspaper clip in the image or in the bitcointalk link.
Andrew and his soon to be wife have had many setbacks, many of which a lesser man would have crumbled. But this last issue meant I had to post this:
The kicker is he was recently hacked and lost 14 BTC (approx $9,053) which he was intended to use for his modest wedding and honeymoon, they are intending to travel to America. Andrew has a debilitating bone disease, which means one day he will be unable to travel
As a recently married individual also having a very modest wedding I truly feel for him, which is why I’ve been making an effort to help.
If anyone wants to help you can donate to the indiegogo campaign I created: 
Or you can donate bitcoins directly to Andrew:
Please check out his original thread here for more information:
I am also fund raising by selling some of the coins I have designed about Mtgox imploding:
I will donate 20% of any revenue from my site where I also sell the coins:
Please note that the pure silver coins now come engraved with their number and silver content and no longer come with a certificate.

Please read the bitcointalk post for a more indepth explanation. 
It's a long story, but I think his teamviewer was compromised and the hacker injected a trojan or keylogger to get sensitive information.

the bitcointalk forum is pretty harsh on scammers, Dob is certainly not one of them.
