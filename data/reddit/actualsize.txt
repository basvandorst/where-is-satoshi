Like you said in your first post, nobody will want to sell bitcoins for rials during hyper-inflation.  But they might sell bitcoins for a loaf of bread if they can convince people that bitcoins are more stable than rials.

Not sure if I missed the freebie - but signed up anyway on the website.
* Some information about your security published on the site.  That's great!
* Two-factor authentication is a great idea too.  Is it mandatory?  If not, then how about imposing limits or quarantines for transactions on accounts not using it?
* Site design is nice.  MtGox is getting too 'busy'.
* About page does not tell me anything about coinbase.  It just has links to articles.  Please put an explanation there.

I think education is the way forward.  Bitcoin is not well known outside a core of tech-savvy enthusiasts so it needs to spread into the public consciousness a bit more.  The trouble there is making it palatable and practical.  My idea is to give talks to some of the local groups around my town and branch out from there.  Just a 5 minute primer on bitcoin to enough people should do the trick.

It's over the top. Bitcoin is similar to anything else where your private key is the pivot of security, and there's no need for all these extra steps to protect your private key.  Just have it encrypted, and have a backup.

It didn't seem confusing to me - there were large orders placed, which has the ability to move the market price significantly.  However, every time this happens it's temporary.  I don't trade much, but happened to be home yesterday so I set up the tickers and watched the madness unfurl.

Site says you have to earn 1000 mBTC (or 1 Bitcoin) before you can cashout.  No idea how much they pay for surveys etc, but it's likely to be a losing proposition unless you can script or otherwise automate it.
@_date: 2012-08-11 22:45:22
Summary of the talk:  
*  Online activities that present a threat to banking institutions (usually money laundering, and malware) tend to be associated with an ISP or other tangible physical entity.  
*  Bitcoin correlates highly with the same activities that money laundering correlates with, therefore it should be watched closely along with other virtual currencies.  
*  And finally, when you are trying to investigate and take action with regards to these threatening activities (money laundering et al) you should look at the ISPs and companies where this activity is focussed.
Nothing bad was said about bitcoin in the talk.  It's just another connection with existing threat profiles that banks have to continually track.

@_date: 2012-10-10 04:48:43
That's an interesting point.  At face value, I think you're correct that exchanging their failed currency for bitcoins is probably not viable.  But now that their currency is failing, they may choose to offer goods and services in exchange for bitcoins in export markets, internal markets, remote working situations... or wherever else it is practical.  One example might be someone offering translation services internationally online - they can accept bitcoins.  So I think it's possible, but difficult, to introduce bitcoin during hyperinflation.
@_date: 2012-10-31 22:09:45
I also use google authenticator for all account actions.  Really good to have that additional layer of security.

try it... see how you go.  Buying 100 bitcoins for a mere $355 seems like a great deal if the transaction goes through.
edit - after a quick search, it appears to be a scam.  The take orders via paypal, and simply never send the product you ordered.  The order is always marked as 'processing' and they don't respond to emails.

I don't think you're correct that bitcoin can't be attacked by following the usual digital forensics trail.  The long way of stating the point in the video is that in the case of someone using bitcoin or other digital method to commit fraud, that person will have a real world address, and be using a computer somewhere, and there will be clues to those things.

@_date: 2012-10-29 16:51:09
The technological overhead is minimal.  Especially compared with the integrations required for fiat currency e-commerce systems, bitcoin is very simple as it does not require token exchange and tracking with a third-party payment processor.  And with being able to implement a simple daemon on your own server, you don't have to pay anyone fees. 
In summary - it's both easy, and cheap.  
@_date: 2012-08-17 18:48:10
According to their fee schedule the lowest fee is when your 30 day volume is over 50k bitcoins.  And it's .25% so I think you have your decimal point in the wrong place.
@_date: 2012-07-31 07:11:07
 the latest from the btc-e devs seems to be that a fake Liberty Reserve USD deposit was made.  Those USDs were then used to purchase huge amounts of BTC.  The BTC were withdrawn immediately.  
What happens next, since those BTC are not recoverable by the exchange, is the perpetrator will need to sell them somewhere.  That's going to bring the price down for sure unless they sell something like 50btc per day over the next 3 years.  
@_date: 2012-09-05 02:53:20
I think that only checks the front-end web server.  The back-end for these exchanges should not even be on machines accessible to the internet.  This 'hack' is the equivalent of a bank being robbed because they decided that instead of a vault, they would keep the cash on shelves in the front window and hoped nobody with a hammer wandered by.
I just can't understand why everyone is being so understanding about this loss.  The guy kept an unsecured, unencrypted copy of a valuable wallet in a stupid place.  It's a newbie error in the extreme and deserves critical attention instead of all this "oh he's such a nice guy though" attitude I have seen in the forums so far.  I hope bitfloor never operates again.  Anyone that puts money there now is a fool.
@_date: 2012-08-16 06:34:15
That's not a question with a right answer.  It depends on what the market decides to do with bitcoin in the future.  If it replaced US dollars, they would be worth $80 million each.  That doesn't seem very likely though, does it?  So something between that, and $13.
@_date: 2012-10-19 04:01:28

This may be the biggest company to accept bitcoin at the moment.  The have millions of users posting every day, and when people want premium services they now have an additional payment option.

Such a shame these bitcoin exchanges charge approx 1000 times more than a regular currency exchange. I guess that is just a sign of BTC not really being remotely close to mainstream yet. If transaction charges dropped to around 0.0005% more people would flood in for sure and not be afraid of trading freely.

What is the history of trade fees on MtGox?
@_date: 2011-09-21 01:03:37
I think the points made in the article are valid. My proposal for a solution to the refunds issue is to make a refunds policy that uses the local currency exchange rate.  So if you buy an 4BTC and want a refund after a massive fluctuation then you get more or fewer BTC depending.
And this is only an issue when merchants exchange BTC immediately.  It can be mitigated by holding the BTC for each purchase until after the return period expires.
@_date: 2011-09-20 19:47:01
Important distinction: your wallet does not contain bitcoins. It stores your 'private keys' so anyone that has even a copy of that wallet can access the associated bitcoins in future.  So if your wallet is ever compromised, generate and use a new one.
@_date: 2011-09-03 06:16:58
I think of the best solution being how a casino does it in person. There's a rake, and it's only for pots over a certain size. That's all, and it's fair. Other schemes are more confusing.

@_date: 2011-09-02 23:32:04
I must disagree.
People that are aware of Bitcoin, and able to use it, can already transfer Bitcoin to each other without regard to borders and without any commission charge or exchange rate. The strength of Bitcoin comes when you DON'T have to exchange it back into another currency to use it.
In the case where 'person A' wants to transfer funds to 'person B' in a country with a different currency, existing solutions are cheaper and faster than MtGox. MtGox charges something like 0.6% for a conversion between Bitcoin and another currency.  If you want to send money using a mainstream FOREX service, they charge around 0.005% - much cheaper!
@_date: 2011-09-02 23:52:45
I love the idea of Bitcoin, but this list seems poorly thought out.  Let's look at each point in turn with regards to the claim that these are all use cases where Bitcoin is 'better than cash'.




Nobody tips bloggers - they make their money from product placement and advertising. This is a ridiculous use case. It goes hand-in-hand with all the people posting a Bitcoin donation address in their forum posts.


The total turnover of the linked website is something like 1 BTC. Not a great indicator that it is better than anything. If I want to sell something from my website and offer BTC as an option - I will need a shopping cart.


OK - this is actually a good one. Sending a dollar to someone in another country or geographical location right now is relatively expensive. But if you want to send an ACTUAL dollar, you'll incur massive fees from the exchange right now and the process is slow.


See point 3 - sending money using other services is still cheaper if you account for the exchange fees of MtGox et al.  If you're only sending BTC and not converting - then points 3 and 4 point out the core advantage of Bitcoin.


Baring in mind this article is based on comparing cash with bitcoin - Cash under your mattress or in a safe is just as safe/good as Bitcoin on your laptop (or anywhere else for that matter).


Played some online poker to compare it with Pokerstars and must agree with this point. It's fast and easy although it's not exactly difficult on pokerstars either - but then you can' play in the USA.


I don't know a single friend of mine that would accept Bitcoins after a poker game at home.


Please let me know this restaurant that accepts Bitcoins.


No co-workers currently using Bitcoins - cash wins again.


This is stupid - why would there be no shopping cart? And if you want to actually USE the Bitcoins you still have to exchange back to something else - which incurs huge fees right now.


As a seller this might seem great - but it hinders buyers somewhat and will probably be an obstacle to adoption.




Right now Bitcoin is really not a good way to protect your wealth.  There are huge value changes on a daily basis. Almost any other investment would be better.


Not coming until many other things are already in place.

I just logged on and created an account with switchpoker to try it out.  There was no mention of bitcoin on the site that I saw, but when I selected to deposit funds (hoping that would lead to a bitcoin link) it asked me for all my personal info.  So it's not anonymous as the Marketwatch article states.  And as others have pointed out, all the exit transactions go through some third party e-wallet site. This undermines the whole point of bitcoin.

Truly an insane amount.  I also doubt that he could trade it all on one of the exchanges, so like all money laundering he would have sold to someone else shady for a fraction of the market value at the time.  If he held on to some of it... he's certainly a millionaire by now.
