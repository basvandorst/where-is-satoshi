 No do not come to Canada. We're building a wall to keep the AR-15 toting fatties out. Was easy to get approval for 'cause it only needs to be 4 ft high. Can't bust through it with your fatty scooter either. Back to Wallmart you Putin snogging alt-right glue huffers. Which of course is not *all* Americans. Saying this because we've got enough hillbillies in this country already ;)

 I was randomly searched by Canada Customs in Vancouver before boarding a flight to Taiwan and just about missed my flight. They went through my bags in public and said it was to make sure I wasn't carrying any large amounts of cash while I'm biting my lip to not mention how tardy in the noggin they are for not asking about crypto. So yeah, the CRA and Canada Customs both have zero clue what's going on and if you want feel worse about Canada's knowledge of crypto just listen to Andreas Antonopolous address the Canadian Senate. Zero. Fucking. Clue. It's incredible this country is still standing.

I would really consider a Trezor if I were you. Ledger bricked my Nano with an update (happened to many others as well) and wanted me to record myself going through a whole checklist of processes before they would send me a new one. Fuck that. I've never been through any such bullshit with my Trezor.

Luckily I had two Ledgers, one was not bricked so I used the seed phrase on that and the coins were secure. If I didn't have the back up wallet there would've been a shit ton of worry...

What are you, a spore?
@_date: 2019-08-14 18:45:04
My understanding is that when they sell an chunk and the price drops a corresponding amount it will trigger a sell order depending on where the order was placed. If it hits enough of them with a sell it can trigger a cascade or two. So the whale sells and buys up cheap and ends up with a lot more btc and room to manipulate which I think is the biggest obstacle in this space nobody seems to be talking about.

Nice! I would like to have enough to make sure the people close to me are fine for the rest of their lives and move to Rishikesh to do yoga and meditation.

How is bitcoin ever supposed to increase in value or attain mass adoption when it's getting any progress knocked out of it by a handful of greasy whales who just end up filling their bags with more and thus an increased ability to manipulate further? I'm holding because I love btc from every angle and just hope it might eventually crush the banksters, but fuck man...

Mine was bricked just like this. My reply from support was that I was to record myself going through a step by step process to try and reset the device. In my opinion this is kind of ridiculous, I did the process over and over, which did not work. In the end I recovered my funds with a family members ledger device, moved them to a Trezor and never looked back. Ended up throwing my Ledger in the trash. Zero regrets except the money I paid them.

I've got a Ledger S and a Trezor One and they were both good (Trezor still is) until Ledger changed from access via Chrome app to a download and bricked my device. Apparently it is recoverable but I've had no luck yet. Funds are safe though, but I'm done with Ledger. I've followed their directions but it hasn't worked yet for me. Trezor, on the other hand, has been fantastic.
