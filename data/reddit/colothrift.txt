I definitely understand that, and this is definitely one of those dime a dozen ideas that has had no real thought put into it so far. It's merely an idea that popped into my head  tonight that would help companies to resolve a certain type of fraud common in online sales. I've never thought of pursuing an idea such as this one before, and seeking the counsel of others who maybe have pursued a concept before and how they have gone about minimizing risk. 
I disagree that people won't pay for an idea. People have gathered millions before an idea was truly even off the ground through things such as startup incubators, kickstarter, venture capitalists, or even bank loans by developing a clear business plan and presenting it well. If you can establish that your idea has potential, and that you are capable of pursuing it properly, there's people who will take a risk on you.
Most tech startups that I have decent knowledge of began with something that ran off their own servers, therefore giving them some control over everything. It seems that it would be more difficult to protect something that is based on a way of utilizing a distributed platform.
I understand every startup is taking a huge risk that they will fail, and if further research of my idea leads me to believe that it is one worth pursuing, I'm certainly willing to take that risk. I'm sure most startups do atleast attempt to identify and minimize the risks they face though. For me personally, the first step in any enterprise I've undertaken is to understand the risks, and that is the point of my post.

There's actually a competition at my school in which I could win 50k if I obtained first place, based on nothing more than a business plan, and if I decided to pursue this idea that's likely the first place I would present my idea, as the whole point is to educate you on how to develop an idea and pitch to investors
