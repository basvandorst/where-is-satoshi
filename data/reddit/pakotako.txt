That's neat think there are a few more BTM's out there
Curious where it updates the list from though but this is a neat site to keep track of where BTM's can be found.

Deep thought. Good read anyway

Because he not only knows BTCKing are using Bitcoin for laundering money, but also Charlie Shrem supports BTCking to do it and help him to do laundering.

Frankly speaking I'm glad to hear such a reasonable statement, because it's true, feds have lots of other important questions to work on

i can't watch the video :( Does anyone fail too?
@_date: 2014-07-28 06:48:51
Ok, so what? Everything I read is already known. Fees were designed to replace the reward system. Do you have a comment about it or is this new information for you?

Marijuana Policy Project accepting Bitcoin for marijuana. That would be a great title

It's level up for bitcoin system in the world, it will be treated like a real currency and turn up to be financial institute

I'm very excited about bitcoin 2.0 and the next years of bitcoin. I think we have finally arrived.
@_date: 2014-09-06 12:46:54
What is the expected price for 2018? Will I be rich with 1 BTC?

@_date: 2014-04-21 15:01:48
Hope there were any large investors who got interested in bitcoin
@_date: 2014-03-09 17:56:59
Pretty nice! I like it.
@_date: 2014-07-20 16:18:05
great painting ill buy it for half a bitcoin if it isn't sold
@_date: 2014-07-21 08:15:29
As far as i know, paying taxes isnt big deal. BTC was not created as tax evasion tool (yes it can be used as one)....or maybe i'm wrong?
@_date: 2014-10-23 16:19:04
Strictly speaking, this thing is not answering your question, but in the future this could be a  [solution:](

I found out that there are less exchanges today than there were a couple of years ago

I like design and the colors of them!

Using a de-centralized exchange could (in some places) end up with prosecution if you transfer over a certain value.
Some places (at least the US) require transfers over a certain value be reported.
It will be interesting to see what happens legally.

I were sure there is nothing connected with bitcoin in Indiana
@_date: 2014-08-09 13:08:16
I will show this to my grandmother,but i doubt she will take out her savings from bank to invest in bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-07-14 08:19:03
Getting those in the third world locations would make conversion easy for locals and turn the remittance market on its ear. The next logical step would be to recruit merchants in those companies so locals can keep their money in bit coin and divest from fiat altogether.
@_date: 2014-07-28 06:48:44
It's not like it's an entirely new idea. Just look at CoinKite. It's also a good idea because so far my phones battery often dies
@_date: 2014-07-21 08:15:23
Registering companyes is only way state can get their taxes from bitcoin, and i dont see it as bad thing. As noone can track every individual and their BTC assets (or they can but really really hard) only place where they can keep track on how much is spent and get their tax share are companies.

He is too old for bitcoin

No, the supply isn't built to continually diminish, it's built to stay exactly the same, that's the whole point of a deflationary currency, if miners were allowed to infinitely create coins then we'd end up just like the dollar, why else do you think a Bitcoin is worth $500+ now? It isn't because Bitcoin is necessarily a valuable currency, it's because they've hyperinflated the dollar so much that it's so expensive to buy something like Bitcoin which is in limited supply.
As for buying early, yeah, so the fuck what? Of course they benefit more, because the people who are buying in early are taking the most risk, when you buy into something early you don't necessarily have any idea of what's going to happen in the next month never mind year and you have to live with the fact you might lose several hundred. This is reality, you don't have the government price fixing or the central banks artificially propping prices up to make people think what they're holding is worth as much as they've paid for, you have to do your research and make calculated decisions.
You, like many other people also need to look up what a ponzi scheme actually is because it's just complete bullshit when used in regards to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-08-31 22:39:58
yeah if me too in the future bitcoin will  may replace credit cards, paypal ecc.. in the future
@_date: 2014-02-13 15:29:00
That's not a fake. There is such kind of card - Maestro. If you never heard about something it doesn't make it fake.

It is better to ask 'why shouldn't we accept bitcoin'
As it is growing system it has its supporters and opponents. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 17:55:14
Humor and bitcoin go side by side!
@_date: 2014-08-25 07:29:50
Bitcoin atms being easier to use, I don't want to slip in an id to purchase bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-08-18 05:34:08
Difficult to say right now! Every single gov is monitoring the financial market. If they find anything suspicious related BTC, they will be definitely tracking the BTC transaction and get the suspect's profile from any related BTC company.
@_date: 2014-08-09 13:08:43
Will the stores always sell the bitcoin they receive right away How do customers get bitcoin they use to give to the store?
@_date: 2014-07-28 06:48:01
How could he think this would be allowed by the creditors?
@_date: 2014-02-13 15:35:01
Nice to see this post. I've read about ATM but haven't heard about Terminal that can be used instead of smartphone. Not sure if I realy need it but the idea is good.
@_date: 2014-08-09 13:09:11
It must have been a reporting error. None of the exchanges showed prices that high and BitcoinAverage doesn't track "dark pools".
@_date: 2014-07-14 08:15:41
Well, a lot of people are in to Proof of Stake currencies which use very little energy compared to Bitcoin. Which obviously "wastes"(I use that loosely since it's a loaded term) a ridiculous amount of energy.
@_date: 2014-02-28 13:43:28
Look how many people are there! Can you tell me when this ATM has appeared in Singapore?
