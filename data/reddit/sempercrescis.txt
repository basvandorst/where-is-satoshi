Its a myth because our spinal cords don't play music

Legitimizing means giving the government backdoors.  The government cant monitor my wallet or the sock under my bed, and thats where my money is going to stay.

Because banning bump stocks will help regular people realise that they really wont be that badly affected by a full ban of guns, which will actually have a very large effect in decreasing murders.  Back to Australia, banning guns worked perfectly.

Get your seed encrypted with a cipher, then tattoo it on your wrist

I thought the whole point of this is that other actors have been stonewalling any proposed changes by core, and that segwit had to be snuck in to get through.  We just went through a period of relatively low fees, who's clogging up the bitcoin pipes then?
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:31:26
because of difficulty fluctuations and being the smaller chain maybe???  I'm never going to know unless you're too lazy to tell me.

Doesn't any decent crypto outside of btc fulfill that too?  I don't even know how im supposed to sell the bch that I supposedly have
@_date: 2017-08-26 02:05:34
Oh true, kraken sells it?  Nice
decent things fail all the time, decent people cheat, being decent isn't an indicator for success, even if we wish it was
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:09:42
how'd they do that?
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:15:04
don't have time for a vid, do you have the basic points?  All I'm seeing is that bcash has failed pretty badly.

If all the bch people are like you I guess I'll dump the coins I got from the aplit
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:10:26
why's that?

last month wasn't too bad, shit cleared right up.

DPR was not convicted for hiring hitmen.  He never sold drugs either, maybe try a valid argument.
@_date: 2017-05-23 04:55:05
He didn't just do it for personal profit, he wrote a fair bit about his ideological motivations.  Fact of the matter is that Silk Road made it much safer for drug users, just like other harm reduction mechanisms.  Shutting it down may look good for politicians, but it's a net negative for society.

He only sold a fifth
@_date: 2017-05-23 12:46:09
I hope you're trolling lol.
What's your viewpoint on the matter?
@_date: 2017-05-23 09:01:24
Get a brain mate, the whole point is that the sentence is unfair for the crimes he was convicted for.  He wasn't convicted for hiring hitmen, so to claim that his sentence is fair because of it goes against the entire purpose of the justice system.

I'm not really on the pulse of what's new and exciting with bitcoin, I could if you don't mind reposts.  As is, I upvote anything that isn't to do with price.
