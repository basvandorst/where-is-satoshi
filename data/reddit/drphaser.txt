We actually do that every time you donate. The world is actually a wallet, and it's balance is hidden inside the game.
The cool thing is that some mobs will steal some of your emerald when you die, injecting it back in the wallet

Hi fellow bitcoiners. This is Cristian, one of the developers of the game. I just want to point out a few things about the game:
The goal of this project is to create a complete bitcoin economy inside the game: that means some people will mine or craft stuff, sell it for bitcoin to other players or traders and will have the choice of cashing it out or use it to buy stuff, enter tournaments, tip other players, etc. The world itself is like a big wallet with bitcoin coming in (donations) and going out (people cashing out emeralds they found)
We believe bitcoin should be *the* virtual worlds currency and this cool experiment allows us to see how bits fluctuate inside the game. We are collecting huge amounts of research data and in a few months we'll post all the details.
Thanks for playing and we appreciate all the feedback!

not right now. if there is a way to pay for the in-game currency we might transform this into a pay-to-win game which is totally what we are against for.
@_date: 2014-11-22 00:10:20
Chances are pretty high, but this is an experimental open economy so anything can happen! example: he makes a cool house and sells it for a few thousand bits he might even make even more than the cost of the game.

upvote for the badass username :D
@_date: 2014-11-21 20:35:59
thanks! you can actually play now! just connect to bitquest.co. will donate the tip to the project if its ok with you. :D
@_date: 2014-11-22 21:53:58
i know we must think this one better. we do know we don't want to charge for currency and turning this into another pay-to-win shit :D
@_date: 2014-11-21 20:34:13
Yes there is a pool of available bitcoin and the game itself stops "issuing" emeralds when the balance drops to zero. We hope that donations will keep the game going! :D
@_date: 2014-11-21 22:04:24
hopefully you will be able to connect with minecift but you'll need a version 1.7.9 or newer. last time i checked minecrift was still 1.6.
in fact im gonna try that right now
@_date: 2014-11-21 19:18:17
connect to bitquest.co
@_date: 2014-11-21 20:33:01
Yes. game wallets are not bitcoin wallets. The world itself is a wallet anyways. Soon we will open all the data on how the economy flows inside the game :D
@_date: 2014-11-21 19:23:57
We aren't monetizing by selling the in-game currency or doing that at all. We did read a hundred times the EULA and still believe were not infringing :D
@_date: 2014-11-21 22:03:16
not right now. soon we will implement a way to sell your house at any price you want just placing a sign that says FOR SALE and in the second line the price in bits
you can buy animal eggs at the spawn so you can create a farm ! :D
@_date: 2014-11-21 20:38:16
The easiest way to get emeralds is by killing mobs. :D
@_date: 2014-11-21 20:37:29
that shouldn't have happened. when you place a bed the land 32 blocks around you is now owned by you no matter if you destroy the bed. ¿can you give me your minecraft username via PM so i can get a look onto it?
thanks for playing!
@_date: 2014-11-21 20:40:09
You will be able to sell your land pretty soon :D 
@_date: 2014-11-21 22:32:02
you must buy minecraft, and connect to bitquest.co. cheers!
@_date: 2014-11-21 19:29:31
Our motivation is to create something that is close as to real life resource economy as possible. We are slowly making a transition from currency injection to circulation. So resources are mined or crafted, sold to other players and soon we will be implementeng other uses for the emerald like tipping, real state selling/buying, item auctions, horse races (yes, that's a real thing happening), etc.

Game Developer here, Did you try to recover your password using:

Minecraft is one of the most diverse experiences in the gaming world. Game modes are so customizable that you'll see a lot of very different servers, so there's a big chance you'll find one you love. The BitQuest experience is not very different from normal "vanilla" minecraft but we included a lot of MMORPG elements there: Enemy levels, experience, damage system, loot, guilds, PvP tournaments, WoW-style travel system... etc.

Making a piece of software that works for you is not necessary something that could work for somebody else. In this case we would have to create proper packaging, documentation and support, which is not bad but it would take time that could be spent pursuing this idea further.
That being said, we do have big plans for the future, so stay tuned ;)
I hope this post will inspire people to write a plugin or similar, maybe even for other games!
@_date: 2015-07-13 19:36:51
It's actually a combination of sidechains (when in game, we create small ledgers that are uploaded to the blockchain when large enough) and on-chain transactions (when players deposit and cash out)
@_date: 2019-02-06 17:16:20
Even if it's a smear campaign it deserves to be discussed as Blockchains that use a "large block size" can serve illegal images
@_date: 2015-07-13 19:34:39
Thanks for noticing, i changed it.
@_date: 2015-07-13 19:42:04
There are a number of workarounds to the x-ray hack you describe, however you are right: Item duplication bugs have existed in the past and we had a few issues, however we always find a way to patch the server code and with multiplayer games, cheating is always there.
We developed a few tools that we use to detect possible new hacks but I won't give out the details for obvious reasons ;)

1. An asteroid does not have an economic incentive to hit you
2. The earth was not designed with a vulnerability on purpose to make possible an asteroid hit
3. No human in the past 1000 years is known to have been killed by a meteorite or by the effects of one impacting, a previous hidden feature on antminers impacted the community just a few weeks ago
@_date: 2015-07-14 00:14:46
Exactly. sorry for the misconception
@_date: 2017-09-04 09:21:03
perhaps satoshi invented his name by looking at logos
@_date: 2016-05-20 17:20:53
We might do it :D
@_date: 2016-05-20 05:27:16
We have short term plans for player-to-player transaction by trading Bitcoin for the posession of a Minecraft game asset. There's no long term plan yet but I believe the cool games of the future will use Blockchain assets as a way to store game objects that you can trade without middlemen and for any type of currency or agreement
That way players will truly own their game objects.

That day is very soon. I'm Cristian and i work in [mego]( where we operate a minecraft server called [BitQuest]( that does exactly that: you can deposit bitcoin in your game wallet, use it in game for trading blocks, items, or tipping and cash out at any time.
And this is just our proof of concept: We are working on our next game which will be a stand alone, free multiplayer RPG/hack&amp;slash with bitcoin acting as the currency. I can't tell you more about it only we are full time working on it with the support of some of the best minds on the bitcoin space :D
If you want to get early access, that would be very helpful for us as we are looking for beta testers who can not only help squash bugs, but to shape the gameplay with your comments and suggestions. You can do so by signing up for our mailing list at [mego.cl](
There's gonna be a big announcement really soon!! 
@_date: 2017-07-21 20:41:20
That is the thinking that made us start [Hammercoin](
@_date: 2017-06-13 08:52:49
I think we are about to start to see a lot more in different areas, not just gaming.
