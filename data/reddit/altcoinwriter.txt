(Mike Hearn + Economic Majority) = Banker Control
@_date: 2016-01-18 21:14:17
People are waking up to the fiat ponzi scheme being perpetuated by the banking system.  And when the people of this planet wake up and discover that they've been lied to for hundreds of years, they won't want US Dollars, Euros, or Yen. The people will demand digital currencies like Bitcoin (and others).
The cryptocurrencies that ultimately survive and THRIVE will be those that resist the temptation of eating the apple offered by the banks, and remain pure to the spirit of Satoshi's vision. We must embrace and protect cryptocurrencies and keep them "by the people and for the people."
If bitcoin can remain independent of organized banking forces, it will survive. Otherwise, the torch will be passed to other communities that can remain strong, united, and inflexibly resilient.

Regarding Coinbase, of course they are toxic to Bitcoin. Why would anyone even ask that question? Coinbase is owned and controlled by the banks: 
@_date: 2016-01-14 02:18:28
It's a requirement for their braintree partnership. Banker-backed coinbase is making inroads into their attempt to co-opt bitcoin. Soon the central banks will control Bitcoin the same way they control fiat.
