I don't sell my coins, so you have to make your own research. Sorry. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 16:25:53
Dont cash out and buy more ;)

Well look, Bitcoin was made for decentralization, so nobody is in control of your money. Coinbase is a exchange wich allows you to buy Bitcoin with for example USD. If you store your coins on Coinbase, it's like a normal bank. Account can be closed, funds can be frozen. The point of Bitcoin is to be in control of your own money without any third party's.

Death by opioids not death by bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 11:03:18
Don't take my advice to serious, it's your money. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 00:41:46
Only idiots are selling there coins now out of panic. Hold, Hold, Hold. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 00:52:48
Yep, just hold and wait! 
@_date: 2017-07-16 00:26:15
A secure wallet. Cold storage if possible. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 12:06:51
If everyone would start using Bitcoin, you don't need to convert anything. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 11:09:33
You can store your Bitcoin in Samourai, if you have a Android phone. 
@_date: 2017-07-05 09:28:29
I believe they just hired someone to code what they can't code. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 12:04:33
Its important now to enforce BIP148. 
@_date: 2017-07-13 17:27:03
Segwit2x is untested code. Everyone should go with UASF BIP148.
@_date: 2017-07-19 22:07:27
UASF BIP148 FTW! 
@_date: 2017-07-16 00:38:57
No, you should always have your privat keys. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 11:19:56
Samourai if you have a Android phone. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 11:04:44
Buy now and wait. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 22:07:46
Please release code on github and make it fully opensource so everyone can use it.
@_date: 2017-07-15 23:38:35
For someone with such a amount of money it shouldn't be hard to fake a death in Thailand. Just thought about that. 
@_date: 2017-07-05 09:38:42
Why blocking ransomware payments? They just securing the network with it, I don't care. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 11:05:41
I sold all my ETH at highest price and now I'm going to buy new. Price will jump back soon. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 00:54:03
Trust me, Bitcoin will survive this. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 16:28:42
Sold all for BTC. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 16:45:15
Maybe 800-900€
@_date: 2017-07-15 23:40:56
 I think the price change has mainly to do with the UASF BIP148 and Segwit2x, but Alphabay made $600,000 - $800,000 a day and that's a lot of money dude. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 00:49:40
Because Segwit2x is pointless and poisoning Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 12:12:32
Coinbase or PaxFul 
@_date: 2017-07-16 00:22:06
Hold your coins! Thank me in a few years. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 00:32:02
Price drop will continue, but it's anyway not bad deal. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 00:44:11
Localbitcoins isn't available in Germany, sadly. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 21:48:56
UASF BIP148 FTW! 
@_date: 2017-07-16 00:41:00
Segwit2x makes no sense, is pointless and poison for Bitcoin. Hold your coins, support UASF BIP148 and everything will be fine soon. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 00:43:57
UASF BIP148 SUPPORT! 
@_date: 2017-07-16 00:24:21
Good move, you will be rich. Never sell all your coins ;) 
@_date: 2017-07-22 17:14:01
Segwit2x sucks
@_date: 2017-07-16 01:01:17
To be honest I see no need for ZCash in long term, Monero has better privacy. 
Just read and do your own research thats the only way to learn about all that stuff. Never invest more than you're able to loose. Never trust someone.
