There are 2 separate and disconnected markets, the real bitcoin market of Bitstamp, BTC-e, LocalBitcoins and so on where the price is $654 right now; and then there's the MtGox world that is completely isolated, but people who happen to have fiat and/or BTC in MtGox are free to trade inside that bubble. They are trading based on rumour and sentiment and possibly inside information, trying to buy low and sell high. They may or may not believe that they will ever be able to get their fiat and BTC out. But as long as they have assets in there, might as well try to maximise by trading.

On 27th Jan I withdrew BTC from MtGox and got a transaction reference, but still that transaction has not been published on the network, therefore the coins have not arrived at the destination address. I have logged support requests for information but these remain unanswered. That's 5 days and counting. BTW, I have had many previous MtGox BTC withdrawals and all have been processed instantaneously. Worrying.

Confidence my friend. Do you feel better or worse about bitcoin in general since this sorry saga? I'm surprised (and pleased!) the prices are holding up so well every else.

I had 4 BTC Withdraw transactions in failed state. As of now 2 have been credited back to my MtGox account with the comment "Cancelled transfer because of timeout". The fees for these two cancelled transactions have also been credited back to me. The other two withdrawals have not been credited back. The two that have been credited back were from 2nd Feb, the two still in the queue are from 6th Feb. Perhaps they have not yet completed the crediting back phase. I'd be interested to hear from others who have withdrawals that have not been cancelled. 
EDIT: Update: the two queued withdrawal orders were cancelled and credited to my BTC account at 13:57 today. Part one over.
