WHEN SEPTEMBER ENDS
Oh. Wrong song. Sorry.

If I was them, I'd try to give accurate predictions in order to maintain my reputation. In their world, a reputation for quality is worth a bit.

I inferred this might be personal for you. Now that I know for sure, it doesn't change my response except to say, you seem to want to talk about your personal problems, and that's okay too. I can see you've done so already in a couple comments just above.
Feel free to continue. If you want to talk about it, I'll listen.

Noob here. What happened? What counts as safe enough? I know offline wallets are a thing, are there further steps to tare beyond that?
@_date: 2017-08-05 14:27:17
If you have a bank account, you signed a contract with the bank that gives them permission to do all the things you described. No one can reach into your bank account and take money without your approval...technically.

And a lot more resistance to wider adoption. Fewer buyers, fewer companies accepting it. Enough reistance could stall overall growth, and collapse this before it really gets going.

Haha. I decided the last panel could be me if I don't get into it now. I didn't buy much at all, as I am still researching and am poor. But I figured I'd feel better getting into it now and potentially losing what little I invested, than waiting and waiting and not getting into it until it's a huge deal.

Miners will lose profitability long before 2140, right? Since blocks are already so expensive to mine, no one will do it for, say, 0.001 coins. When is the cost of mining estimated to exceed the profit?

Late!? I could have suffered through anything. But not that. :'(

Absolutely. They don't have that power with cash, but hardly anyone uses just cash.
It's more difficult for them if you control your own bitcoin keys, but I'm not entirely sure that won't change as bitcoin gets bigger.
If bitcoin gets bigger, I have a feeling the government will set up its own bitcoin pay networks, or at least enforce a law saying we have to use certain ones that they monitor. They can't really stop unapproved bitcoin transactions, in the same way they can't really control drugs or anything else. But they can scare you into submission and levy crazy unfair penalties.

Not everyone has the same sense of humour, and that's okay. You didn't laugh. That's okay. Others did. That is also okay.
@_date: 2017-08-15 20:38:31
I agree. Widespread trust is what matters. I see a direct correlation between people losing a lot and learning to distrust Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:30:38
Me too. Heard about Bitcoin in 2012, read up on it a bit, and thought, "Wow. I can see this going places. I should buy some." Didn't buy into it until this year.
@_date: 2017-08-12 20:07:21
I'd buy a house looong before I bought a Lamborghini.

Thanks for the answers!
Encryption, while certainly offering more protection than a safe combo, does seem awfully similar.
Currently we can wire digital USD. No physical size or weight. Bitcoin currently has the benefit of not being blockable or seizable, true. Not that that's a worry I often run into with USD, but it IS a legitimate point. Is there a way to ensure Bitcoin remains that way, or could future laws get in the way? Is this an advantage that's set in stone, or can it change with the winds of time?
I love the idea that Bitcoin can't be debased or inflated away. That, I think, is by far the strongest benefit.

That's how I pronounce it in my head every time I come across it. I don't even make a conscious effort. My mind reads "x-bone" before it reads "x-b-one".
@_date: 2017-08-09 01:18:48
Well, that's a pretty terrible post to jump-start a conversation. It's not even a question. Mashed potatoes is just as likely to start something.

Wow. I don't often see clips of Hero. Such a good movie. Good job on the sub titles, whoever made this.
@_date: 2017-08-07 06:00:02
Awesome. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-08-14 23:55:42
Sure. But you don't have to choose one or the other. If you want people to listen to your facts, it is best to consider feelings too. If you don't care about acceprance of your facts, why even give them?

5k by yesterday.

Oh definitely! I am happy to finally be a part of this and look forward to many many years of growth.

He attacks traditional banks, but I have yet to hear how exchanges that hold your bitcoin for you are drasticly different from banks or how you holding your own keys is drasticly different from you putting your money in a personal safe. Anyone want to explain it to this noob?
@_date: 2017-08-09 13:48:49
Honey pot? I looked it up, but am having trouble finding anything about it in a financial context.
@_date: 2017-08-05 17:26:46
Agreed. Though perhaps I'm missing something here. It seems Bitcoin works in similar ways. If you have someone else store your bitcoin, you have to electronicly agree to give them at least minimal control. Of course, you can always store it yourself, like any currency, and have full control.

What's the name or source of the meme? I've seen it, but never heard a name.
@_date: 2017-09-10 16:33:41
This is extremely informative. I wish I had something this clear when I was first researching crypto. If I have one complaint, it's that this document talks about scalability without ever defining what that means. Even so, this is the best "Crypto 101" article I have read.
@_date: 2017-09-14 12:52:20
This sub seriously is cultish. I have seen comments where you could replace the term "bitcoin" with "god" and it becomes pretty much identical to weird cult sayings I've heard. Someone actively discouraged helping newcomers once, saying all that mattered was blind faith, so we should be mean to newcomers who ask questions in order to test their resolve.
And some people believe that literally the only reason the price goes down is because of some grand conspiracy involving manipulation from the shadows. Like everyone is out to get get the chosen few saviours of money.
r/btc is worse, if my visits are any indication, but that doesn't change the fact that the front page of this place is pretty silly most of the time.

Just bought a little and now the price is declining hard. It's a weird day.
@_date: 2017-10-03 12:55:02


Is that how much ordinary people have to invest? I ask, because that number is shockingly large to me. But good for them, all the same.
