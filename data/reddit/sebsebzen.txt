It's all funny money anyways. Don't mistake this kind of numbers with real "money", it only exists in their computers. If it was to be unleashed on the real economy, it would crash and burn. For me, these insane valuations (e.g. UBER, WhatsApp) are a symptom of the inherent flaws in the current financial system.

It's not about mining per se, but having a chip based wallet that helps maintaining the network, which then enables micropayments for all kinds of Internet of Things applications. Did I get it right? And damn, somebody already registered droneshippinglanes.com

You could probably use NuBits, which takes out the volatility.
@_date: 2015-07-27 16:45:17
I think you just answered the question yourself.
@_date: 2015-07-19 10:40:46
I'd argue, but I guess it's pointless. NuBits is not another coin. It's a decentralized peg that helps Bitcoins in many ways. It neither is a competitor to BTC.

Too bad. I hoped it was the other way around. That would have been a killer app.

Actually this meme is not good for Bitcoin in Thailand. Thaksin has been ousted on corruption charges and is a persona non grata for the ruling military government. Anything he does to promote Bitcoin will likely lead to a crackdown. I wished this post  was not on top of the reddit page.

I'm not sure if they trust the RMB more than the US$, after all China has a massive shadow banking problem. While from the outside the economy looks stable, people on the inside know that all books are cooked and economic growth is funded through massive (hidden) debt. Both currencies are equally untrustworthy, but still seems better to diversify and - like you said - buy some real estate or other assets abroad. You also have to consider that hey have no access to proper stock markets. So, why not funnel some RMB to the US and speculate in the NASDAQ. 
Second point is that China has negative interest rates. That means, if you deposit money on your bank account you lose. This prompts many savers to invest in so called "Wealth Management Products", which promise high returns (10-15%) within 3-6 months. How exactly they achieve that is unclear, but often involves speculation on real estate and other risky assets. I can imagine that WMPs also might look into inflating the Bitcoin bubble to generate returns.
@_date: 2013-11-20 13:51:48
I think Bitcoin is interesting for Chinese mainly as a tool to circumvent capital controls. Then secondly as a speculative asset. I believe that's behind the recent spike and drop. Smart money moving into Bitcoin and then out of China into USD, EUR and fiat currencies.

Wow, you speak Chinese too? To add on yours, from my understanding 币 stands for money as coin (硬币). So it's a very accurate translation of Bit + coin.

"[...] Matthew Mellon, who has a history of drug problems, is facing a 21-page writ from Reno, which accuses him of going on crack-cocaine binges and alleges he wrongly accused her of embezzling business funds. The court papers reveal that at one stage, because of his "repeated drug relapses", Reno made Mellon sign a contract to pay her $1 million if he started taking drugs again. She made it clear she would have nothing to do with him if "his persistent pattern of drug abuse" continued." Source:

The Chinese government is known to issue very vague regulations that are up for interpretation. I that sense, I believe that with Bitcoin they currently have a wait and see approach. Let it float for a while and see what happens. While there are plans to for the yuan's internationalization, capital controls are still an important part of the Chinese economic model. Therefore, if Bitcoin grows out of control and enables in- and outflow of "hot money" a crackdown could occur at any time. However, they also don't want to miss an opportunity to weaken the dollar as global reserve currency.

The Shanghai Stock Exchange is NOT open to foreign companies. None of the top global players are listed there. You can only invest in some 65 Chinese SOE's that are overvalued and have a lot of insider trading going on. But, if you are into Ningbo Bird and Panda Electronics please go ahead!

Average mainland citizen cannot easily invest in HSI. Chinese government wants to artificially prop up their stock exchange in Shanghai and Shengzhen, so there are still many regulatory hurdles for using RMB to invest in HSI shares. Besides, they are all traded in Hong Kong Dollars. Mainland China and Hong Kong are two entirely different systems.
