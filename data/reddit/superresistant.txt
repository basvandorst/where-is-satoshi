What do online-virus-scanners say about it ?
@_date: 2016-08-05 16:32:34
A pretty dangerous cocktail but it's all Windows.
Don't use Windows guys.

Hi, is there a virus in the attachment ? Windows virus ?

there is no contradiction, I was talking about R-RBF and not full RBF
@_date: 2015-12-05 16:09:11
IDK, maybe you wrote in a way that I don't understand. English is not my native language.
* On the title you say : I call it R-RBF for restricted RBF
* On the first line you say : Use case 1 is to undo wrong fat finger transactions
* So I understand that the use case of R-RBF is to undo wrong fat finger transactions. Why would you write it that way otherwise ?

I need French sub please.
@_date: 2015-12-09 17:09:24
Ok I get it.

Shit comment

I can't believe people keep ignoring the Nxt decentralised asset exchange + the MultiGateWay.
Also the SuperNET project is on its way.

It's the 3rd time isn't it ?
What about 2 factors auth ?

The big difference is that electrum is a SPV wallet. It connect to a trusted full node instead of being a full node. That way you don't have to download the blockchain but have all the functionalities.
You can actually do it using Bitcoin core if you're an advanced user but electrum does it automatically and have a record of trusted nodes.

Electrum for desktop. I don't care how it looks but I want maximum control features (keys, addresses, fees, ...).

+1 so badass
I approve.
@_date: 2016-01-30 18:24:29
Awesome dude
@_date: 2016-06-02 08:38:57
Who else would it be ?

The best solution would be to have Satoshi himself to destroy all of his BTC instead of having to do it or steal them.
@_date: 2016-11-05 18:15:17
I bought knowing that was a bullshit news. Bitcoin traders are so amateur, that's almost scary.
@_date: 2015-07-07 11:40:08
Fucking trolls : 
Looks like a failed attack, an attempt to FUD to get cheap BTC.

FFFFFUUUUU (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻ 
@_date: 2015-07-24 11:20:49
neat. I like it.
@_date: 2015-07-29 19:28:15
Are you a wizard ?
@_date: 2015-04-30 07:39:21
Congrats !

The ability to cancel a Tx few minutes after is a really important feature because end-users are used to be able to cancel.
EDIT : Not a real Tx but undo wrong "fat finger" transactions.
@_date: 2015-11-21 15:11:51
Yeah but... proofs ?
@_date: 2015-11-28 09:33:00
@_date: 2016-05-02 07:52:27
Proof or gtfo as usual. Why don't he shows us a Tx ?
@_date: 2015-11-08 10:06:22
You get it larrylegendary. It amazes me how bitcoiners don't realise that bitcoins are worthless if not decentralised and if no new services are created around Bitcoin. 21inc is the only company in the world that try to decentralise Bitcoin and bitcoiners think it is useless.
Bitcoiners, YOU are useless.
@_date: 2016-05-02 10:46:18
Proof or gtfo. There is no way around and no reason to cry.

In many countries, credit cards are highly regulated and sometimes illegal. In France, no one knows what's a credit card, 100% of bank cards are debit cards that we call credit cards.
@_date: 2015-02-11 21:39:41
Wow I never got any tip.
