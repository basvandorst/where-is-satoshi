Figured as much.

Both are online trading entity's which require tons of verification(s) and can/could lock up your coin if they feel your buying/selling too much and/or not verified enough.

Actually I just came from one of the local Bitcoin ATMs in my area.  IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL EXPERIENCE!
When I was there someone came in right behind me to get them some bitcoin. 
The age we are in...

Thank you
@_date: 2015-06-12 05:12:40
No, never even heard of it.  I will look into it.  Thx
@_date: 2015-06-12 05:13:41
Thank you for the details.

Thank you and after browsing LibertyX and bitcoinatmmap.com  I'm actually going with bitcoinatmmap.   You transact it all at the ATM machine with CASH up to $2500!

I for one am happy that it's NOT PEACEFUL any more!  Not because of the loss of life, no.... BUT because do you really think the governmental power structure, the supposed "elites" at the top of the governmental power structure actually care about peaceful protest????? HELL NO THEY DON'T!!!!!
There is a reason NO governmental structure that is out of control has been changed by PEACEFUL MEANS.  
It's a shame that when someone mentions that there seems to be only one road to correcting this (non peaceful) all of a sudden people get mad at that person and want to persecute them for saying the obvious.  Persecute them from wanting to remove the blinders and no longer be sheep. Look at the USA, people around the world are revolting against their governments for one third of what the US citizens are putting up with.  And yet, the sheeple of the US still sit back and do nothing.
I congratulate you all on a job well done and I hope it continues to escalate until a real solution FOR THE PEOPLE comes about.  IF not, then it will be all for a waste of time.
And btw, I donated!

To add, are any of the full validation wallets such as Armory or Electrum better/quicker at this?
@_date: 2014-12-16 22:18:51
Thank you!
@_date: 2014-12-17 01:09:29
I see, Thanks!

I'm familiar with bitcoin but have been out of the loop for a while. I prefer the full security/validation.
In my understanding when receiving payment via full validation it doesn't take as long, and your sure of the transaction by the fact you have the entire blockchain.
With the lighter wallets, it takes longer to receive payments and because of this, can lead to certain risks. 
Would this be a correct summation?

Thank you!

Hmm.... if this is powerful enough to run a node.  Could it also be used as a bitcoin wallet?  Send and receive coins by maybe logging into it?
@_date: 2014-01-23 03:05:37
Bitcoin is GREAT, BUT it is not the end all.  It is a positive step in the right direction that is getting more people to **think**.  
@_date: 2014-01-23 02:01:29
I agree, that's the only thing about it.  From the peoples point typically it's unorganized and unruly which is to the advantage of the structure.
@_date: 2014-12-16 23:23:11
I see, since it doesn't download the full blockchain.  How long does it take for your transaction to show up within your wallet?
@_date: 2014-12-16 16:52:42
I see, Thanks!
@_date: 2015-05-26 00:42:41
Could you please provide a link to a service that provides this?  Thanks

Take out the "Satanic" part.    
It's word-play, they call it "Systematic Torture," while other calls it Ritual Abuse.

I agree with your frustrations in this, especially if you have a lot of coin at stake. 
Not sure why people act like bitcoin exchanges are really just not trustworthy at all and a new sorta no central authority exchange needs to be in the works.  
This would filter out 99% of exchange exit scams.

Link with a semi-moderate setup: 
Even though the author is speaking about Litecoin I'm sure there are some correlations to bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-03-15 04:04:47
No, a wallet would be just that, a wallet where you keep your coin.
This is a payment address for customers/clients to send payments to.  So I don't have to e-mail it or carefully call out each syllable.  They can just scan the paper.
@_date: 2015-11-27 23:12:14
Well over the past year or so, many who have done some form of this have been brought to light even on Then with the news of the coin.mx owners not only scamming from customers coin but also doing other nefarious stuff behind the scenes. 
I remember during the time of the Silk Road debacle a few Chinese Bitcoin Operations exit scammed.
So it is happening, and well known.  If bitcoin is going to get even a bit more traction in the public sphere the one thing it needs to be is trustworthy.  And so far it has shown anything but.

They will be sending payments to my wallet.  Just as if they copied and paste it into their bitcoin wallet to send payment.  But instead I hand them the receipt/sheet and then scan it directly to send payment. 
I've seen many do it online on vids and such or in pictures but I never figured how to.
@_date: 2015-03-15 05:32:04
Even though I was looking for a offline program for this, this will do.  Thank you
