EDIT: I see they do have a very brief SENTENCE about bitcoin and hashing...and that is it under Graphical Processing Unit entry...
EDIT of EDIT: there is a bitcoin entry already, but let's get bitcoin morespot light where it deserves it!

I work at a CNC shop and after a few hours of training, I was told to make something. This is it :) Let me know what you think. I was thinking about making a credit card sized plate like this one but smaller. What you think? :P

Forgive me for my ignorance on this, but how are they going to build something when the gov't has no money and are bankrupt. All this is, is nothing more than FEAR MONGERING which they need. The losers have no money and even their 'shadow ops', is exposed would shake the very nature of our society and wouldn't risk it themselves. They base their budgets off decade old projections. Hell, even the FED is questioning their sole existence today! 2014, year of change, and with change come hard work. Sorry Obama, you had your shot back in 2009 and lost it

why not? we can have bitcoin (or whatever makes it) be the global currency. have a REAL global free market that decides the price. for what it is worth, we don't have a free market now. more like a life support market. having tons of currencies is great and all but what is the point. sure side ones probably would be of more benefit, especially if they grab early footing (ie bristol pound or other regional/city-state currencies), but i sure would enjoy going back home to poland from the US and just use one currency versus going through a exchange that has it's rates set by rigged markets and banks :/

You mean bitcoin, silver or gold? If that is what you are referring to, than it should be blatantly obvious. quanitative easing, manipulative markets, and the tax payer (ponzi) game should be some good enough reasons to hold **some** of your assets outside of fiat currency which is a joke and very very unstable. all fait currencies are trying to debase themselves to see who reaches the bottom first. it's like a bunch of dogs fighting amongst themselves for the last scraps before it's all gone.

i have! shame i would like to spend a bit more time to learn more about it. i love this organic and back to coexisting aspect of reality that i stumble upon from time to time. :D if you have any great resources, please share :D

i think the mainstream media (whores) have a lot to do with it along with the so called 'economists (professional guessers perhaps be better suited) along with the gov't/bank mongering. once the cracks appear exposing their shenanigans to the public (and not behind doors as now), then the mindset and volume will certainly change.

and another score for BTC and a loss for fiat currency. stay strong my holders

True and apologies as got my mind concerned about with what's going on. But in short it's due to China's gold import export restrictions back in 2015. I am not sure how much they've capped it at for average joe to move gold in &amp; out of China. If anyone has a number for that, please share as I'm quite curious what it is.

This is so absurd. As all these Keyesians keep shrieking, "it's a barbarous relic..." Really? Please do go on...mhmm sure.... Oh, so then, why are these men being stopped for carrying these relics? I crossed the border once carrying a bunch of WW2 relics from my home country and nobody batted an eye; declared or not. I wonder if they mean having these relics 'hurts' the current system by slapping the current fiat paper currency game as.... a game that less and less of the population are willing to play. Perhaps gold is being recognizing as a valid (and as rightfully so through most of human trade) form of wealth and real money today causing these two individuals from being illegally detained? They can keep their currency till it no longer has any 'current' legitimacy to operate. BTC/ETH/DAO/??? are all alternatives that exist today (although not perfect but has a long way to go nonetheless, like email or even the internet) that can replace today's 'relic-like' financial system. While the current system begins to burn, Bitcoin and other cryptos can use this time to learn from the mistakes of the current financial system to make it something beyond our wildest dreams!
I absolutely agree that this would not even find any news moving 3.15mil across the Hong Kong border be around ~4.7K BTC (at the time of this post). Once people realize (prob once their banks have a Cyprus moment) they will look to alternatives and BTC simply has to simply stand back and be able to welcome people with open arms. That will be a day most of us will witness when Bitcoin will be declared in parts of this planet as legal backed and recognized sound money. And since average Joe has access to a smartphone and computer device, we're getting closer to this being reality. Enough said and rant done.
On a side note, it be pretty cool if fast forwarding to the future we have a gold/BTC standard where BTC is backed by gold which would give everyone the best of both worlds. I really believe it's no coincidence that Bitcoin is represented on a 'gold' coin.

Because it's REAL sound money as it has been used for thousands of years for trade/barter and hard tangible, limited, and desired asset. 
It's money regardless what people say as those are the ones who don't want change and discomfort that this transition will bring upon.

Hold onto it till next year. BTC hasn't touched ANYTHING yet. If you still have those BTC, HOLD them as BTC will touch $3-4K before the end of the year. Chinese are buying like mad and they are wise for doing so. They have realized the dollar is worthless and are putting as much of their assets into crypto-currencies. This is driving up all the other currencies in the process as well. Or you can give the $280K to your sister for making bad judgment calls. Your call in the end, either way.
