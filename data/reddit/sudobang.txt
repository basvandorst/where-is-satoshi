Yeah, this is what I came here to say.  I use Purse for all of my Amazon shopping and have saved some serious dough (&gt; $100).   Never had an issue that left me unhappy - and have only had good experiences with support staff.
Would really be interested to know more about buyer demographics - I guess I have been assuming they were mostly people in foreign countries trying to cash out of amazon turk, or people in the US/Europe who just need an easy way to get bitcoin and are ok with paying 20% above market.
Can't wait to get home from work, Purse emailed me that my bidet arrived :)

Consider selling them on an exchange for "Euros".  They're like gift cards for French things.

Anyone have a recommendation for the best way to accept both credit cards and bitcoin on a Ruby on Rails site?
I was really hoping this would allow you to keep bitcoin payments as bitcoin, but unfortunately that's not the case.  I've integrated stripe for a few clients and can attest to how easy to use it is, but definitely want a way to hold.

Sorry but I can't take a site with the domain bitcoin-betting-guide.com any more seriously than one named magic the gathering online exchange.
Keep protesting, voting, AND using bitcoin.

I just don't think that's true, I showed my buddy the Android app I use, and within a couple minutes he too had and was able to use cryptocurrency.  When we're talking &lt; 100 millibit in an Android wallet, there's no real need to discuss paper wallets etc.
We're not here because Bitcoin is easy, but we're not here because bitcoin is hard either - we're here because bitcoin is 'better' in the varied ways with which we have come to that conclusion.  I Do think there's a shortcut around understanding it (using it), and I think expecting that everyone that will ever use bitcoin will understand how it works is fanciful.

Why?  People are using bitcoin as a store of wealth, as they do with many investments or commodities.  Sure, bitcoin has an amazing property that it can be transferred at minimal cost, across global borders, but I don't think its use (as paramaterized by transaction volume or number of transactions) as a currency is the primary driver of its value, nor does it have to be.  Most fiat currencies have vastly vastly higher transaction volumes than bitcoin relative to, what we in the bitcoin camp often refer to as, the market cap of a currency.  Do we have to believe that the value of bitcoin is inextricably tied to its use as a currency?

I think that us bitcoiners tend to overevangelize bitcoin in an unnatutal way.  How incredibly simple it is to actually use bitcoin gets lost under the difficult cryptographic underpinnings, perverse libertarian ideology, media sensationalism etc.
I've taken to not really talking about bitcoin as the fascinating technological advancement it is, but rather treating it as its a easier way to do money.  Like when splitting the cost of a meal at a restaurant, throwing in a "if you put it on your card, I can pay you back in cash or bitcoin" or showing off how easy it is to pay for something online by scanning a QR code, often sells someone much more than a description of the Byzantine generals problem or a little rant on cryptography.

We'll know bitcoin has made it, when a post like this doesn't have 150 comments, but rather just one: "So what".
For now, TO THE MOON!

[Install linux on a usb drive]( and then just install the wallet software. Standard wallet encryption is likely good enough AES256.  I believe this is the standard encryption algorithm that TrueCrypt uses.  You do not need to connect to the internet to generate a valid bitcoin wallet, but obviously with the use you're describing, you'll be connecting to the internet anyway.

Have you ever actually used bitcoin to buy anything online?  It's a better/faster experience overall.
I'm not saying bitcoin is better at everything, I'm just saying we should be a bit more nonchalant about how we convince people to use it.
@_date: 2015-01-28 21:06:40
I guess you could say this is ... great exposure for bitcoin.

They're such drama queens.
They're making $100 keychains for god's sake.  If you license your code with LGPL *of course* other people will use it.  Thats kindof the point.

Is there somewhere we can monitor the number of segwit transactions/block?  Interested to track it's adoption
@_date: 2017-08-24 17:10:48
That's perfect, thanks

It makes more sense to look at transaction fees in aggregate,  but if you really want to look at this single transaction in particular... US $0.66 transacted for $0.08.  The fee in this case is over 10% of the estimated amount transacted, over 8 satoshi/byte.  If this had multiple inputs,  it would have been significantly more.
@_date: 2017-10-01 16:52:47
Fees are still quite a bit higher than they were a year ago -  I used to slang around BTC for a fraction of a US cent.   I pointed out that I don't think continually increasing the block size is a good long term solution to stress that I think that a 2mb blocksize is really quite reasonable to buy time and allow for adoption.   I think a segwit2x compromise is more in the spirit of working together than alienating the miners and those of us who want cheaper transactions without waiting an indeterminate amount of time for lightning.
@_date: 2017-10-04 16:46:35
Sigh,  give it a rest.  10 cents is a lot to pay for a transaction.
@_date: 2017-09-17 19:14:57
I see your point - there's a limit to how much scaling we could get out of a blockchain decrease.  Jumping to a 1 minute block time for a 10x increase would seem premature to me now (consumer adoption is growing - but gradually), and drastically change the economics of mining.
As I understand it, proposals for blocksize increases are stopgap solutions until second layer solutions, like lightning network, are widely available.  Other blockchains are propogating just fine with much shorter block times (Ethereum, for example, has a 14 second block time, and zcash is like 2.5 min).
@_date: 2017-10-16 12:57:22
Next time try  and save 10%
@_date: 2017-10-01 16:00:24
Sure, I'll go - I support segwit2x.  Since the blocks filled up, transaction prices have increased to the point where I'm convinced adoption won't really progress until something is done.  We're kinda at a point now where everyone has heard of bitcoin,  but using it is kind of shitty and expensive.  I don't think blocksize increases are a good long term solution,  but I think that it's the one we need now (since lightning isnt ready, and segwit adoption is in the single digits), so that newcomers aren't turned off, or old hands don't flee to other coins. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 17:12:17
Sorry I'm not willing to wait 43 hours for a cheap transaction.  Do you really think 90%+ of bitcoin companies and exchanges would support this compromise if it was bad for bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-05-06 16:15:46
Interested to hear thoughts on the elasticity of demand for bitcoin transactions with respect to transaction fees.
There have been a few times in the past months where I have chosen not to use bitcoin because of the requisite fee, and I'm intrigued by the potential short-term effect of modest block-size increase in transaction fees reduction, and increased usage.  Do you guys believe that a modest blocksize increase - such as provided by Segwit - would actually chew through the mempool and result in tiny fees.  Or will lower fees bring enough transactions back into the pool to make the fee decrease less substantial?
@_date: 2016-05-11 17:11:44
I'm getting a bit tired of comments like this that present bitcoin as the ~one true blockchain~.  I think they stem from Bitcoiners feeling like they're getting left behind as new technologies are developed.
I think, as a software engineer, what I find most interesting about bitcoin, blockchains, and permissioned ledgers is that they are a better data model than database entries for currency, assets and contracts.  It gives the participants a direct link to their entities, rather than requiring a 3rd party system to authenticate with in order to manipulate and transfer them.  I agree with this video that there's a tremendous opportunity in representing assets in that way.  I don't have a problem with private blockchains, and see them moving towards proof of stake in the future.
I imagine a future where many coins, chains and ledgers play together well, and don't see it as detrimental to bitcoin that blockchains geared more towards smart contracts, or private consortiums of banks are adopted - it's not a conspiracy, it's innovation.

A lot of people here will say that you will regret spending this bitcoin if/when the exchange rate increases - I think they're just plain wrong.
I've been spending bitcoin for years and regret nothing - I buy some of it back, and some I don't.  I don't pretend to know the future of bitcoin any better than any of the speculators now.  Spending bitcoin is what convinces me it has worth, and has kept me interested over time.  And yes, that interest has made me a nontrivial chunk of money along the way.
We're in a new era of money boys.  This is a hell of a ride, and I'd rather play the game then bet from the bleachers.

Oh the memories.  Back in the day I was quite the runescape captain of industry.  I didnt play like most people, I literally had people mining e-coal and minerals for me, which I'd then sell in lots for a sizeable markup.  I'd march around the mines, collecting the coal from the peons that worked for me, and then off to the market, where I'd shout "COAL COAL COAL".  I acquired millions of rune dollars, which are probably sitting untouched in some database somewhere.  If only bitcoin was around back then...
