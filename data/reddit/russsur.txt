Here is a more detailed description of what happens.
If you want to sell a bitcoin, there are basically two prices that interest the market.  The price you are ASKing for, and the price a buyer is BIDding to buy for.  
* As a seller, you have a choice.  You can post to the market that you are willing to sell to anyone who offers your asking price.  Or, you can sell immediately to whoever is offering (bidding) the highest at that moment.
* As a buyer, you have the reverse choice.  You can post to the market that you are willing to buy from anyone who will accept your bid price, or you can buy immediately from whoever is asking the least at that moment.
So, buyers tend to "line up" in a queue according to the amount they are willing to pay, and sellers "line up" in a queue according to the lowest amount they are willing to accept.
If a bunch of sellers show up and sell to buyers, those sales happen in order, by descending price.  As buyers are "used up" by selling to them, the price goes lower and lower as we run out of people willing to pay a certain price.
Conversely, if a bunch of buyers show up, they will buy the lowest priced bitcoins and "use up" the bitcoins available for lower prices, leaving only those priced higher for the next guy to buy.  As long as the next guiy is willing to pay that next higher price, the price climbs.

1. No.  Just order them and they arrive soon after.
2. Yes.  The Casascius coin holds the private key.  You import it and that gives you access to that address, which was loaded with the bitcoin(s) you bought.
