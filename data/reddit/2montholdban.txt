Holy fuck the buyer just told the admin i enabled escrow AFTER I WALKED AWAY and my bitcoins are still not in my pocket what is this twilight zone I am in.
@_date: 2013-07-31 04:20:34
This is a bunch of bullshit. So how fucking long is this shit allowed to drag out? After the police it will be local court, then federal, then surpreme court? I doubt there even is a real person and it's you guys screwing over your users to make a quick dime.

His police report was a buisness card with numbers on it. So either that was fake, or the story. Someone just sent me the link to a text message spoofer. Send texts to anyones phone using any number you want. FML

Thanks for giving me a excuse. I do it because I get OCD about anything clutter.
@_date: 2013-07-31 08:25:21
Sue him? He does not have any money to fork over if he is doing this shit. I can buy fake ids from the silk road ALL DAY LONG.

Let me not forget he told support I placed the bitcoins in escrow AFTER I LEFT the starbucks. Wwwhhyyy would a scammer do this?
@_date: 2013-07-31 08:22:27
brother, screen shots were provided to them.
@_date: 2013-07-31 08:00:41
Sure dude. You get fucked out of 700 and then "learn and move on." That was only about half of my total income.  How does it seem fair! They asked ONE fucking thing from me. They did not need my id. Fuck this bullshit and fuck you too.
@_date: 2013-07-31 03:46:41
the dude had a 1 day old account! So this process happens everytime there is a scammer?
@_date: 2013-07-30 23:44:48
24 hours later and nothing. I have good reason to worry. You have $700 in bitcoins that your considering handing over to a apparent scammer. Not to mention the bill I had to pay with that 700 is overdue. Your quick to pr on reddit but sit on your thumbs doing support. What do you need from me? I ask agian 24 hours later

UPDATE I GOT FUCKED!
The decision was emailed to me. Here it is.
*"Hi, we come to the conclusion of releasing the bitcoins to the buyer in this case.*
*Arguments for the dispute resolution:*
*- The buyer complied with all information requirements, providing camera shots from the SMS messages, ID, police report.*
*- The seller didn't provide SMS messages on the request, and denied providing the ID. At the second request of the SMS messages, he explained that he had deleted the messages.*
*- The seller claimed doing nine local transactions on LocalBitcoins.com before, but when inspecting transaction history majority of those were not local.*
*- Times line up to support the buyer's story*
*- The seller SMS story differs from the buyer. The seller provided SMS would be easier to fake, since it is from archived text. The buyer SMS camera shots would be much more cumbersome to fake, and buyer provided them very promptly.*
*While we could wait for the police case and Starbucks evidence tapes, we don't see the benefit here, because the seller stays anonymous to both us and the buyer.*
*For reopening this case we hope to police to contact us with the evidence from the security camera footage in which case we hope to have further evidence of the actual events on the incidence.*
Excuse me guys, im going to go cry and scream into a pillow.

Why was I asked for a scan of my drivers license? 
@_date: 2013-07-31 09:51:39
I delete my phone messages every night and I provided them with google voice screen shots. Sorry I don't archive with encryption to my hard drive every day.
@_date: 2013-07-31 08:14:51
Dude, the second time they asked for sms I told them I had deleted them on my phone, but had them in my google voice trash and would need to screenshot the texts from there. 
Why the fuck do I need to provide my id?
@_date: 2013-07-31 08:49:28
Yes. Said he gave me cash, and I told him I would release the funds when I got home, then I walked away. The next day he called the police after being asked by lbc to provide some kind of evidence.

This is a civil matter. There are no starbucks tapes. I called the starbucks and asked if anyone had called asking about tapes and they said "no, not at all.  We don't have security tapes other then at the cash register." I called the police to ask about the report and they said it was a civial matter, not a criminal,. You are NOT liable for this. You are liable to the bitcoin community right now at this point. Release my bitcoins.
Come on.
@_date: 2013-07-31 08:48:29
funds were released to the buyer. Who is not me.
@_date: 2013-07-31 09:28:22
They don't take anal rape victims. :(
@_date: 2013-07-31 05:40:48
Well you just said it was a  one sided case with buyer providing a bunch of information? What information do I need to provide? Some made up police reports and texts sent using a text message spoofer? 
@_date: 2013-07-31 07:54:25
I don't know man. The guy said it was his first time and he would be more comfortable if we did. I was just trying to ease him. Fuck.
@_date: 2013-07-31 08:16:57
They already released the bitcoins dude. Whos going to shell out 700? 
They only asked 2 things from me. I asked where to send the sms and no response for 3 days. I asked why they needed my id
I have done 9 transactions local. Most of them resulted in the person never coming back to confirm the trade, or wanting the coins sent directly to a wallet.
The seller had HOURS to fake those texts, I produced what was asked  for in about 15 minutes.
The timeline adds up is an opinion.
