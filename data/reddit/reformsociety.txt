Wouldn't GDAX suffice? Bank Wire to GDAX ($10 wire fee), transaction fee for buying is 0%-0.25% 
Don't know why this hasn't been recommended--am I missing something?

Note that you pay a higher price (BTC: 15k, LocalBitCoins: 16k)

Moontrade is a SCAM. You cannot withdraw coins from wallet. Stay away! SCAM!!!
Also, check MVWeiss's history. Unreliable piece of shit scammer is in on it!

I've been banned from the subreddit. 
I have tried using a legacy address and it shows the same error. 
Please do not promote that site. They are low life scumbags who have scammed others as you see in my images.

So I'd have to transfer from GDAX -&gt; non-Segwit Electrum -&gt; Segwit Electrum? 
Which is then pretty pointless as the fees on non-Segwit Electrum are pretty low (less than 20 sat/byte)?

I just made an Electrum Segwit Wallet but when I try to withdraw BTC from GDAX, GDAX is saying the Electrum Segwit Wallet Address is invalid (addresses start with "bc1")
Any suggestions?
