Classic cars don't actually increase too much. At least, the value of an old maintained vehicle is extremely volatile and subject to the whimsy of collectors.

If you are putting so much information out there that you need to switch Reddit accounts every few days you are doing security wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:02:50
That doesn't quite make it decentralized. The average money user relies on others to secure their money which means there would have to be institutions who would handle a user's crypto wallet which means we are right back where we started.
In a lot of ways I'm already just looking at numbers on a screen when I buy something. I already hardly use or carry real cash.

I getcha. But you'd be surprised at how quickly cars lose value and how long it takes for a car to get it back. Cars that are 10-15 years old are hardly worth anything. For instance, if you look up Blue Book values for this 2008 GT this guy is selling it very much is worth 0.73BTC which is around $8,000. Also, try to find a stock vehicle from the 80s that anyone wants. Nobody wants those cars. Anything from the 80s to now aren't remotely popular vehicles unless they are super luxury cars. That effects the pricing, as well.

Depends on when and how. He's not functionally wealthy if his only assets are Bitcoin. It's nearly impossible to liquidate that number of crypto at this value. For example, if you had 100 million in gold you'd have about 2.5 tons of it. Try to buy anything with that. Need to by a Camry? You'd have to find someone who will buy $20,000 worth of gold for cash. Not saying it's impossible, but most crypto markets, like banks, limit the amount of cash you can take out. Also, Bitcoin doesn't pay dividends.
So, maybe you slowly cash out what you need this year, say $100k just to be comfortable. Then Bitcoin crashes down to $5k or less, or completely bottoms out (unlikely). You're fucked. You had a good year. Now you wish you hadn't told your boss to go fuck himself.

Interesting. But there's nothing on there that I haven't made public and nothing specific enough that could be used against me. But I get what you are saying. If you don't want even that much known about you online it can be an issue in an age where you have to interact online. I have a friend who doesn't do any social media and only calls and texts through Signal.

Interesting. I know I've left clues here and there buried in my comments but I try to be very conscious of what I give out. But I guess I'm interested in security but not fanatical about it. Of course, when talking about crypto it's probably more important but I don't have that much invested.

It doesn't help that apps like Robinhood allow crypto purchasing purely for speculation. You don't own it. You can't spend it. You can't transfer it to an offline wallet. Once again, reliance on short term personal gains has ruined things.

You're a misogynist asshole who hates women. You don't even like your own wife. Considering the vast majority of men manage to have all kinds of positive relationships with women means the likely problem is you.

So, the only way Bitcoin is better because you can send it over the internet. Cool.
Because you do have to store it, secure it, and purchase it at a premium if you are using exchanges.

I think people who bought high last year are cashing out. There will be resistance at 20k.

@_date: 2017-11-29 03:50:34
At the same time people need to see it as having some measurable value. The trouble is that it's a finite commodity and people tend to hoard those like precious metals. No one buys anything with pure silver even though everyone agrees it has value (measured in fiat, no less) and is easier to verify and exchange than crypto. Bitcoin is very volatile right now due to this speculation. Once this levels off people can start using it as a currency.

So, is crypto money or is it a commodity? Is it a store or wealth or does it facility the transfer of goods and services?
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:18:21
Of course, when it was hitting $20k everyone was talking about how it's undervalued and will be at $100k in two years.

So, he's the worst president because a bunch of corrupt modern politicians are abusing policies he set forth 80 years ago? I think you should research what life was like before the New Deal. It wasn't exactly good. Also, Greece and the United States are not remotely analogous.
Aside from that, you can only assume the economy would take a long time to recover if you only pay attention to the markets. But people recovered. The middle class was strengthened. The average person had access to wealth and services, educational opportunities, like never before. How is that not an economic recovery? It's better than a recovery from the Depression. It's a recovery from a state of practical serfdom for the majority of people not lucky enough to be born on top or brutal enough to claw their way there.

So? What about mining? Anyone in the developing world who didn't mine early or can't mine now will only be buying it which means they are further transferring wealth away from their community.

That's what I did with Ether. I bought at $300. Only what I felt I could lose. Not so low but not peaked. I sold a portion at $800. Kept the rest in because I had recouped my initial investment and was now playing with house money. Decided to sell the rest after my mining pool paid out. One morning I woke up, with a mining payout, and Ether was trading $1300. I sold the whole thing.
The thing about only buying in what you can lose is you can remove some of the emotion. If you are all in then you can't help but sweat everything. It's hard to stick to rules and make rational decisions if your head is on the block.

That's what I'm talking about. Right now the value of Bitcoin is tied to its demand as a commodity. You further limit its availability by not producing more and the value goes up, not down.
