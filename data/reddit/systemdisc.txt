Bitcoin are divisible to the 8th decimal place, and supply is limited because of the fact that the block reward halves every so often. Eventually, it'll be halved beyond the 8th decimal place, causing the block reward to be zero. At that point, roughly 21 million Bitcoin will have been generated as block rewards.

This is exactly why phishing websites are so successful.

I ordered a Skyhook in January 2015 and still have not received it. Support does not respond to my emails.

Everyone that responded is correct, but to answer your questions specifically:
* What's the most confirmations a block can receive?
There is no limit. Each block generated after it is initially included in a block is a confirmation.
* How long until a transaction no longer gets confirmed?
A transaction gets confirmed each time a block is generated after it is first included in a block. One thing that can happen is a transaction gets included in a block that is later orphaned. That would remove the initial confirmation. If the transaction was included in the block that orphaned the previous block, you would still get a confirmation. If the block that orphaned the previous block **did not** contain your transaction, you would have to wait again for a block to contain your transaction.
* Does the genesis block still get confirmed every so often?
The genesis block gets confirmed each time a block is added to the blockchain.

I think you're a bit confused. JavaScript is client-side. The JavaScript 0day exploit is targeting the end users, not the servers.

You can try [bitcoin-otc](

My efficiency with p2pool is almost always &gt;100% and I hash at ~250Mhash/s. Recently, I typically get &gt;0.0125 BTC per day.
You have to make sure your miner is set to a very low scantime to avoid stale shares (mine is set at 1 since it's just a loopback device - 127.0.0.1).
EDIT: You have to realize that a share is found on p2pool's chain every 10 seconds. Having a scantime higher than that probably isn't smart. Also, you won't make a share on p2pool's chain until you reach the appropriate difficulty. Currently, it is ~1350 since the pool rate is ~679GHash/s.

No, problem :P It seemed a comment worthy of internets.

Do you have a reliable source? Could you link it? I'd love to get some cheap yet viable solar panels.

I use bitcoin-otc for all of my trades (BTC to and from PayPal USD, MoneyPak USD, bank deposits, et cetera).
