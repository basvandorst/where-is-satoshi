My thoughts exactly. Youre not the only one wanting to buy on a dip

last few pumps were followed by $700 dip retracements. Seems like this dip today was right on par.

Lots of people sold their alts, to then go into tether while BTC dropped. Their plan is to buy back in when BTC is cheaper, getting more BTC. But selling their alts crashed the price of alts. So as BTC goes up, they decide they wanna get back into the alts, so that causes the rise in alts as BTC rises. Also because BTC strength shows overall strength in the market so they buy back into alts again also.

What does someone do who made hundreds and hundreds of trades over the course of months? Like how do I figure out what to put on my taxes? Seems like a crazy amount of work

Coinbase. The the money to them. Transfer it to GDAX for no fees. Send to exchange and diversify

I have heard so many people try to compare specific chart types to crypto. I think it's all BS
