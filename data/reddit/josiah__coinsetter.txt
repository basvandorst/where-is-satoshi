I'll definitely be making an appearance! I've been looking for a chance to make it out to the BTC center
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:46:28
Pm'ed with a code. We'd love some feedback too!
@_date: 2014-04-29 16:12:50
You're quick to underestimate Mastercard. What would a direct push against bitcoin offer to them? Anyone with half an ounce of understanding regarding bitcoin's potential would realize it is a virtually unstoppable technology. Mastercard has stood at Visa's heels for years, why not make a move to embrace a technology that could cut international transfer costs more efficiently than anything else out there? 
Don't get me wrong, it's much more likely that they are lobbying against, but I'm just saying, don't completely dismiss the possibility of the opposite being true.
@_date: 2014-02-13 00:38:55
I am referring specifically to bitcoin exchange withdrawal/deposit systems. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:29:45
PM'ed as well
@_date: 2014-04-03 16:26:15
Reach out to them on their facebook event page (the website is still being worked on)
@_date: 2014-04-29 16:45:39
Your negligence of a definitely non-zero possibility is disappointing. When Mastercard officially declares the fact that they are lobbying against is when I will dismiss the possibility of them lobbying for, until then it will remain a viable option. Dismissing non-zero, non-negligible possibilities can prove to be very damaging mindset in the long run my friend.
@_date: 2014-01-11 06:35:20
this. It's a huge population market to tap into. Just another chance for more widespread adoption of BTC.
@_date: 2014-04-11 19:48:22
Or improve and adapt! Just because our history is a bit tainted with such activity, doesn't mean our future has to be.
@_date: 2014-03-13 19:27:09
Using Bitcoin saves them just as much money (and headaches), if not more, than the average joe. Cost mitigation is one of the most concentrated on practices at large scale corporations, such as eBay. Not to mention, they can still collect fees off of the transactions that occur through their system; after all, exchanges have no problem in doing so.
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:56:17
I don't think I can name a single thing that would make us happier. PM'ed!
@_date: 2014-01-10 00:54:03
Why not?
@_date: 2014-02-05 15:30:10
Have you personally traded on either by any chance?
@_date: 2014-05-12 21:17:15
This. All it takes is one external person gaining access to the wallet software.
@_date: 2014-01-11 07:23:44
haha I just discovered foodler and placed an order. I was so happy to be able to find somewhere to order this late at night.
@_date: 2014-06-07 18:44:56
Woah. Thanks for the heads up, I've just reached out to a couple of mods to figure out what's going on.
@_date: 2014-03-13 19:17:39
They were actually one of the few banks to not get completely burned by the CDO (subprime mortgage bond derivatives) market crash. In fact, if my memory serves me correctly, they actually profited off of the whole debacle.
@_date: 2014-03-17 15:42:20
You would be incorrect on that one sir
@_date: 2014-02-28 21:21:26
Wow I was literally just looking at your site. We're looking forward to it!
@_date: 2014-06-05 19:46:25
It helps a surprising amount with people trying to game the system.
@_date: 2014-02-12 21:28:24
We never said we remember anything. Just because a process is done manually doesn't mean it's done in an unorganized or chaotic manner. Very large companies thrived for hundreds of years before we had even the simplest automated systems. Also, automated systems not only increase your risk of being the target of exploits such as transaction malleability but also increase the time-frame of exposure to such exploits.
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:28:41
PM'ed with a code, enjoy trading!
@_date: 2014-03-31 19:52:35
I'm not referring to any of his specific ideas in enacting change, but more so his overall message that change is necessary. From the fact that we are pumping absolutely massive amounts of capital into financial and debt instruments backed by essentially nothing, to the issues rampant in the legacy banking system.
Perhaps I'm wrong as well, seeing as he often points to deeper flaws such as greed and excessiveness to be the cause of our problems. But regardless, his opinion and writing on Bitcoin is practically guaranteed to be a great read.
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:44:18
No no no, thank you!
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:42:43
Whew that was close. Hope you enjoy anyway!!
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:51:03
We can't wait to have you! PM'ed
@_date: 2014-04-11 19:39:32
The article or the reddit post?
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:27:03
Woop. Thanks for that :)
@_date: 2014-03-27 14:26:44
Highly recommendable firm!
@_date: 2014-03-17 16:13:45
Haha it wasn't directed towards you at all. It was a general statement. Sorry about that, didn't mean to come off as hostile!
@_date: 2014-02-26 17:43:31
As pointed out to me by a friend very familiar with Gox, their true value lies in their connections. Go to bitcoincharts.com and take a look at how many currency pairs they offer(ed). They have established avenues of exchange literally all around the world, with connections to payment processors, merchants, and even financial institutions. Granted those relationships may be strained right about now, but they still exist.
@_date: 2014-06-05 19:48:56
We quite enjoy hoop jumping. You guys and gals quite enjoy bitcoin... It's a win-win.
@_date: 2014-03-17 16:07:44
No worries. Btw check out the multitude of other interviews Jaron has done and executed very well... I am kind of disappointed in you guys to be honest, that more research wasn't done before deciding to pick up the pitch forks.
@_date: 2014-04-11 22:06:11
NY is a hugely influential state. Positively leaning legislation here could have other states following suit. Not to mention it would provide a framework for other states to base their legislation off of, meaning less time and work on their part.
@_date: 2014-03-13 17:37:30
To be fair, that is the most accurate part of the report... I've heard of this use of capitalization to differentiate between the currency and the protocol on multiple occasions
@_date: 2014-02-12 22:25:08
These guys are some serious bitcoiners. In reference to the trading classes, they're taught by the best cryptocurrency trader that I have ever personally met. If you have the time, I highly recommend making your way down to the Center. I always have a good time (and conversation) when I make a visit.
@_date: 2014-03-31 20:10:05
Exactly my problem haha
@_date: 2014-01-03 19:16:14
The CEO, Gabriel Mirón, has a history of remittance related projects/work so it's safe to say they definitely have remittance issues in mind.
@_date: 2014-05-12 21:14:52
What if someone outside of the bank's network gets their hands on the software to run a node themselves?
@_date: 2014-05-12 19:06:54
None provide cost and time efficiency across international borders as much as a blockchain-based solution does. 
Regarding the POW issue, you have a point. Which is why the belief that they may embrace bitcoin hasn't been completely thrown out the window. The mining power that backs  bitcoin is hugely advantageous when compared to starting a whole new blockchain. Unless of course, they decide to go with a completely POS or some other alternative 'proof-of' solution.
@_date: 2014-03-19 18:31:07
I see you didn't read the article. I invite you to do so.*
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:16:07
But actually, it's a regulatory based issue. We can't legally accept FIAT funds from US-based customers. Believe me when I say, it's just as frustrating for us, as it is for you guys.
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:31:50
Wow right back. This is why I love Bitcoin, what a community!
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:43:56
Not dumb at all MrEoss. It gives you access to our trading platform which is currently in a late beta phase, which therefore requires a beta code to use.
@_date: 2014-02-26 14:53:34
Even though I said I was going to cut it off last night, I guess I can do one more for a fellow redditor. PM'ed
@_date: 2014-03-13 20:20:42
Paypal still has to deal with fees from credit card companies, as well as the slew of costs associated with international payment processing.
@_date: 2014-04-28 18:09:34
I believe this was a federal-level seizure. I'm not sure how high up these kinds of auction sites reach, but I'm certainly interested in looking into it further. Thanks!
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:47:33
Just shot you a PM with one!
@_date: 2014-03-13 19:14:08
Well why do you believe so?
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:14:37
there's a bug in the ACH protocol....
@_date: 2014-03-17 15:51:59
Granted I am bit biased, but you guys are being absolutely ridiculous. You can't expect every single speaker representing Bitcoin to be the equivalent of Andreas. Jaron was honest about the security issues, you can't expect him to just leave serious issues out of the conversation. 
Also, just because he believes Dorian to be Satoshi has nothing to do with his credibility as a CEO. I'm just as involved in the community and knowledgable about Bitcoin as almost anyone I've ever met, and Jaron is still teaching me something new about it every day. 
For every little scrutiny you guys managed to pump out from your keyboard at home, there's 10 more in the mind of every non Bitcoin viewer watching the show and the three predominantly anti-bitcoin cospeakers. He chose his words carefully and I've already received positive feedback from non-Bitcoiners that I told to tune in. I think he did well, definitely better than I would have at least.
@_date: 2014-01-10 01:36:28
I see.
@_date: 2014-06-03 15:59:55
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:49:39
PM'ed! 
Feedback is greatly appreciated!
@_date: 2014-02-26 15:08:00
Very interesting. I just linked this to our CTO.
@_date: 2014-03-17 16:51:22
The fact that you care more about who a CEO thinks is behind an internet username is more important than how he can run a company absolutely baffles me.
@_date: 2014-02-26 00:02:09
I'm not allowed to disclose much in that regard, but believe me when I say it'll definitely be worth the wait. 
@_date: 2014-03-13 17:13:24
Thank you!
@_date: 2014-01-10 01:35:58
A lot of people in the bitcoin space have been accused of a lot of things. You learn to take things of that nature with a grain of salt.
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:30:45
Well we're interested in having you! PM'ed with a code.
@_date: 2014-01-03 05:46:47
hmm interesting. I'll have to look into this further a bit then.
@_date: 2014-01-04 20:24:09
Why would people waste their time... It's practically impossible to realize/actualize any profits on Gox. Not to mention even withdrawing BTC from them has proven to be way too much of a hassle.
@_date: 2014-03-13 22:08:59
How so?
@_date: 2014-02-28 21:32:23
Hey hey. Coinsetter is venture-capital backed, with a team that consists of former investment bankers and wall-street level trading platform developers. But to be fair, SecondMarket entering the space in such a way is definitely a game-changer.
@_date: 2014-04-28 15:04:07
So which US licensed exchange did they go to, to legally perform this transaction?
@_date: 2014-01-10 01:32:03
Hmm, I didn't think of this. But do you really believe that alone is enough to justify this kind of volume?
@_date: 2014-04-11 20:27:56
Well that's why we're trying to really make a push for implementations in exchanges such as cryptographically backed proof-of-solvency and a more heavy reliance on the blockchain technology itself, ie. multisig.
@_date: 2014-02-13 00:41:31
Due diligence. Staying up-to-date. Knowing where your systems' weaknesses lie. Staying on top of customer reports... Mostly just common sense business practices that unfortunately certain companies in the space haven't followed.
@_date: 2014-04-28 15:47:02
We need blockchain evidence.
@_date: 2014-02-26 23:09:25
Was going to post, but you beat me to it haha. It's a great read and inspires a strong sense of confidence in the future of Bitcoin, or more specifically the future of Bitcoin related companies.
@_date: 2014-02-26 00:12:01
Essentially yes, that's how it works. You're completely free to deposit/withdraw BTC whenever you want. However, when on the platform you're free to trade both USD and BTC any way you please.
@_date: 2014-01-10 05:53:50
You're not accounting for the ban on third party payment processors at all... Unless you're trying to say the 0.3% fee influenced the drop in volume more than the ban.
@_date: 2014-03-28 20:44:28
When you deposit coins, they get converted into their USD worth of "foodler bucks". Which can then be used during checkout to pay for your food.
@_date: 2014-03-31 19:31:31
I have been trying to get in contact with him for ages regarding Bitcoin. I feel as if BTC is everything that he's been calling for since Liar's Poker.
@_date: 2014-05-12 21:49:55
Virgin definitely makes sense with the  hashtag. 
@_date: 2014-03-17 17:06:12
No one knew anything for sure before Dorian released his statement. It is a recent turn of events that Jaron was unaware of before going on camera. Drop the pitch fork buddy, we're all Bitcoiners trying to change the world for the better, and this is doing nothing to help that cause.
@_date: 2014-06-07 18:12:00
We're definitely considering opening up other alternatives (feel free to shoot us/me any suggestions that you may have). The added value of piloting the program with Coinbase is that it allows for indirect ACH funding of an US-based account.
@_date: 2014-03-13 20:18:04
To be honest, poor judgement. I thought it would have been overly circulated around the subreddit by now.
@_date: 2014-04-17 18:56:02
Typo in the other title. I'm a bit OCD about these things
@_date: 2014-01-13 04:59:27
Don't shoot the messenger guys geez
@_date: 2014-02-11 21:47:43
Believe me when I say, it'll be well worth the wait. The mistakes of rushed and not well tested systems *cough cough* have hurt the Bitcoin community enough, we're not trying to follow suit.
@_date: 2014-03-05 14:51:53
Do you possibly have the link to this article? I'd love to give it a read.
@_date: 2014-04-29 15:54:23
Who knows what Mastercard has in the pipeline? It's a very obfuscated situation, of course, but one that can very possibly go either way.
@_date: 2014-03-13 21:38:06
ah of course. They were heavy investors in credit default swaps (the insurance against CDOs you mentioned) and managed to get enough, before anyone else coincidentally, to overtake their losses.
@_date: 2013-12-22 21:20:49
The man is addressed as "Mr. Nakamoto"
@_date: 2013-12-23 02:16:42
Just because it can be a million other things, doesn't mean it can't be Satoshi. 
It does a lot more to prove it's Satoshi than your argument does to disprove it. I still don't understand why it matters the buyer said it. It should hold just as much, if not more, weight than if the seller had said it. I would never expect Satoshi to slip up like this, therefore if the seller had said something confirming his own identity, that should be a red flag to everyone.
This very well could be Satoshi, people can try to twist the facts anyway you want to make yourself believe otherwise, but the facts remain the facts. Mr Nakamoto's name was mentioned and then a 100k BTC movement followed. 
@_date: 2013-12-23 03:46:33
now that you mention it, what are the possibilities of this holding some connection to Silk Road... 
I mentioned Gox as a potential cause, I don't see why veteran SR1 guys couldn't be involved.
@_date: 2013-12-23 02:32:36
Perhaps more than just one whale...
@_date: 2013-12-25 20:08:09
Yeah, I was a bit disappointed, not going to lie. But alas, exposure is still exposure.
@_date: 2013-12-20 02:22:35
Ni hao.. You just witnessed the extent of my Mandarin knowledge. 
Chrome translated enough for me to figure out the big brown bubble with a BTC symbol with a number following it was Volume.
It's a little over 90k BTC. I don't know why no else is seeing it... Perhaps try with chrome?
@_date: 2013-12-20 02:29:10
Thank you, and give the guy a break. He did kinda sorta change a shitload (the official estimate) of people's lives for the better.
@_date: 2013-12-22 21:49:24
For clarification, does anyone even know of any known transactions involving Satoshi outside of the first blocks?
@_date: 2013-12-22 21:29:28
what about it? The private buyer provides a method of contact.
@_date: 2013-12-22 21:13:20
Sure, editing them in now.
@_date: 2013-12-20 01:54:20
You could have simply stated there wasn't enough info in the first place. Thanks for the help, as tawdry as it was worded.
@_date: 2013-12-20 02:09:10
In the sense of sites such as bitcoincharts.com and cryptocoincharts.info
@_date: 2013-12-22 22:29:19
I was asking a question, not making a statement.
@_date: 2013-12-22 21:57:11
It's you who's not understanding. If anything, it would maker more sense for a buyer to make a mistake like this versus someone like Satoshi.
@_date: 2013-12-20 01:34:18
It's called Chinese. It's this neat, new form of South American slang.
@_date: 2013-12-19 23:38:55
He meant general financial equality, as apartheid rule is tremendously more difficult without the lack thereof. 
Appreciate the thought, however.

A quote from the program: "Bitcoin the safe-haven investment for the 21st century"
@_date: 2013-12-22 21:51:38
Yes, and I link the wallet and both transactions in the post. You can examine for yourself if you'd like.
@_date: 2013-12-22 21:32:37
No one said $ was involved...
@_date: 2013-12-23 02:30:11
Thanks for clearing that up. Any thoughts on what this means/leads to. I've only reached dead ends from here on out.
@_date: 2013-12-22 21:24:49
All of these were also associated with this transaction by following the trail of the BTC. All of them have seen major volume as well.
@_date: 2013-12-22 22:23:41
That's a lot to imagine.
@_date: 2013-12-23 02:27:38
This is the alternative I can picture myself. Very few individuals have access to these amounts of BTC, and none that come to mind have a history of going around parading as Satoshi.
Perhaps some very early Mt. Gox players are making moves or Gox itself is doing some internal money shifting. It's the only exchange/company I can think of that could account for the high BTC amounts as well as the BTC days being destroyed.
