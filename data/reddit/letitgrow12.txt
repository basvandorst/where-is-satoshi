I agree. I am 27 and I bought. Was late bought bitcoin and alts only starting in June. Did however take advantage of the mid July dip and I still feel it's worth buying. It's def not too expensive compared to where it's headed! 
Blockchain is the future!

Wow... I love it. We have the Saturday night into Sunday morning drop coming and bitcoin is killing it!

Agreed. Man I am so glad I took 10 eth for 1 bitcoin a few months ago. I only have 1.16 bitcoins now. Feels like my investment in alts are worth keeping than getting fractions of a bitcoin. But overall add bitcoin with my profits. 
Even a little is enough. It adds up over time. Can't think of it in whole bitcoins too much anymore.

You have to link bank account, debit card, and credit card for $500 limit even if you don't use other forms of payments. It's needed.

I agree. Figured it would also put a lot of misinformation to rest for those that have heard about Bitcoin but don't really know about it. 
Open some eyes up while being entertaining unlike a documentary that just shoves facts in your face without a story line.
I would follow 5 groups or people threw the early days from the beginning till now and most likely a year or so into the future since it will take time... really interview them and capture the true experience. 
Just like they made The Social Network... it was a very well made movie that captured that excitement of something great in the making.

Well obviously would have words at the end "Currently Bitcoin is priced at _____ being used by ____ businesses. ______ new investors everyday. 
Or something like that. You know?

Seems not all agree here. I think it would be really cool. Have some really ideas to really Capture it.

Well it will take time. Ain't gonna release it next year. But I would put it together if there is interest. Probably take at least 3-5 years. 
Just seemed like an interesting idea to show how it started and how it's becoming more legitimate. It can be good watch and possibly be an eye opener as well.

I am not talking about a documentary. I am suggesting a real film with actors. 
@_date: 2017-09-23 21:04:38
That's exactly what I would be going for. All the way from the beginning. Beginning of the film will be Satoshi Nakamoto finishing the process... only you won't see "him", just fingers on a keyboard and a screen. So leaves interpretation still open.
Then track a few people/groups that actually exist from the beginning and more along the way. All the way till it crushed $1,000 first time and crashed back down. The media, the use case growing into a legitimate currency.
The rollercoaster that leads till present day and opens eyes of what it can do for the world and why it's valued the way it is.
Anyone of my creative friends who saw social network felt motivated to want to create something new. A film like this would be inspirational as well, but also open a lot of closed minds to the fact that BTC isn't going anywhere and that is really can make a difference...
Then of course like I said in another post... the text at the end explaining possibly like currently " " billion dollars are traded in BTC everyday. " "more people investing in crypto currency a day. BTC is accepted at " " business. 
I mean it's still rough draft but I have all the ideas I just need to track a few miners from early days, dare I say Roger Ver being on of them but not highlight his life too much, just kind of like when his named is mentioned in the film those who know him get it but would see him as just a regular guy. 
Write the script based on these and follow the growth closely. 
Regardless what reddit thinks, I feel this could be a great film if done right.

Agreed, those are great examples too for multiple perspectives. 
@_date: 2017-09-23 15:50:53
I agree and it will take time to make. 3-5 years release. 
@_date: 2017-09-23 21:52:01
Nah, I am talking a serious film. To leave a euphoric sense of inspiration at the end. 
@_date: 2017-09-23 15:27:39
I am not talking about a documentary. I am talking an actual movie, like The Big Short, The Social Network type of directing. Really capture the experience and the history.
The documentaries aren't movies.

I think it's main point is that Bitcoin is too big to be stopped, that they are much smaller, even with their guns and swords.
