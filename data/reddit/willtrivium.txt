Awesome, thank you guys. I appreciate the help.

Awesome, thank you! 
Yeah, I was nervous about running the .exe, because it could be any number of things, up to and including a keylogger. I didn't find any information online about it, or on our Sub, so I thought I'd ask. Either way, this'll be a great way to find out, and potentially flag the website or get it taken down in case it is malicious, so other people won't fall for it. 
With that being said, a BitcoinWisdom Windows application would be really cool imo. I've only taken an intro coding class at my Uni, so I'd have no idea where to start to make something like this, but it'd be cool if we could get a community project going to develop something like this.

About 0.8 BTC. Myself and a few friends from college decided to invest a little bit of money and give Bitcoin a shot. 
To be honest, it really sucks, and I'm pretty bummed out right now, because that's a lot of money for me. However, if anything good can come of this for myself and others, is that we've all learned a valuable life lesson. Stay strong guys, I know we'll make it through.

Thanks for exploring it. 
Yeah, that qtopentrader thing looks cool from the vid/screenshot. I agree though, BTCWisdom is the best.

It really might be him. Who knows, he could be lurking this thread right now...

When Jack Lew says that basically Regulation is coming, expect it. (sic) What would that mean for the Bitcoin Community as a whole? 
Generally, Markets don't respond well to any sort of regulation, but there is a lot of uncertainty in the marketplace right now. Is regulation a necessary force at this point, or will there be some middle ground. If the U.S. regulates BTC to death, in a way, how would it exactly differ from USD? 
I think one of the strengths of BTC is the anonymity factor and how it's harder to trace. (The same goes for physical cash v.s. debit/credit cards) What do you guys think about this?

Not even MtGox asks for that. SSN online 99/100 times is bad.

Very cool! Congrats guys!

What an excellent evaluation! Very well put!

This is an excellent question. Additional question though, if the Government creates Bitcoin tax laws, would this mean that they're accepting it as a form of currency, or just taxed as capital gains in USD?

Thank you, Mr. Senator for taking the time to address the concerns of an ever growing community of individuals and local businesses who have faith in a decentralized currency.
