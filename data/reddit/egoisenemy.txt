as bitcoin just dropped a few hundred dollars. I still believe in the long term but I'm thinking this recent dump will slow down the insane momentum for a while.

I wouldn't say investing is a form of gambling, since gambling involves random chance that no one can control (unless they're cheating).

markets have their own specific supply and demands. Coinbase maybe made of more bears than bulls so it's a lower price. In addition, the vast majority of people aren't subscribed to multiple markets so they cant sell high and buy low.

Money's greatest worth is financial security, having the money to buy your freedom and pay for your shelter, food, utilities, healthcare, passions, etc. Until we win the rat race, we are all subservient to our jobs/sources of income we work for.
