You deserve a cookie. 
This recovery would not have been possible with rates as low as long as they have been. The second we hike rates up considerably again, economy goes into the toilet, yet this time we have double the debt!

Like it or not, banks will never die. I'll repeat it for the benefit of those in the back who didn't hear me: BANKS. WILL. NEVER. DIE. You can have the biggest hard-on for bitcoin that you would like but banks still serve a functional purpose in many aspects of our life. They may learn of ways to implement blockchain into their business but they won't die simply because of 21M BTC. Way too much power and control at stake for that to happen. 
I'm saying this as a realist who also likes bitcoin.

Until we get to a point where all employers are paying wages in bitcoin then the government will not be weakened. On those fiat wages, the government has the ability to tax you and put you in jail if you do not pay what you owe. This is what some don't understand.

The only way you profit in USD is if you convert your BTC to USD at a higher price than you purchased the BTC for. If you bougt at $3000 and now it's worth $4000, whether you sold your "gains" of $1000 and then re bought, you would still have the same amount of bitcoin, assuming the price did not rise, regardless of selling your "gains" or not.

I realize its a silly question given US propaganda, I just figured it would be worth asking others more knowledgeable...

At this rate you could max out a credit card with say $5,000 in BTC and then if it goes up as high as we are all hoping the appreciation would pay for the interest many times over...

Haha... not going to do it, just a whacky idea :-)

Business Insider CEO is VERY anti BTC and believes it is all worthless. This is why they push an anti-BTC narrative everyday.
