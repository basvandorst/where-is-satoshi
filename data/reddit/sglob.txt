I guess we have to pop on the rocket and take a trip to the galaxy,
but this time we aint go to the MOON, we going to the other part of the galaxy LOL,
all this hype should be stopped, instead of looking at it a damn investment, (we don’t talk like that about other currencies, gold, silver etc) start implementing it adopt it and use it as our new way of doing business and exchange goods
have a nice weekend guys

haha true story
@_date: 2018-02-27 22:34:39
I have no idea what are you speaking about,
first of all Im not an american, and English isnt my first language
actually it's my third, and if i've misspelled, so probably it was a typo 
@_date: 2018-02-14 21:55:06
Im a firm believer in bitcoin since 2013 when I discovered about it, I had few which I sold back than for 900$, but it's not the point
it will take time, but imagine you have 2.5B people without a bank-account, and they’re reluctant to trust it,
fiat is the worst thing which possible, countries fight wars today with currencies, and we are to suffer
you pay banks commissions for money that is not exists, the last half a year, all the hype, let it chill, because it's not an invesment
and above all that, we can trade with privacy, and you wont wake up one day, want to get some cash from the bank, and the banks will tell you, sorry all your saving are gone (India, Venezuela, Greece...)

exactly USA has its own special manners
but fck is common. its a usual term, like sh*t and so
@_date: 2018-02-17 21:21:35
kids those days can teach us about bitcoin, all those who was born 2000 and beyond, entering to a such amazing era
so many things are going to be change for good, of course some how(hopefully not) countries(pushed by banks) will try to regulate the shi* out of it
@_date: 2018-02-16 22:22:55
let's forget about those kids for a second, and lets leave all this speculators aside as well,
currently, I can agree with the use of bitcoing, even though it is being used in a lot of countries already, SK planning to adobt it fully, Slovenia, Japan, people in SA are really interested in it, 
and honestly I dont really care if it will be bitcoin or marscoin or whatever, just waiting and believeng that we are going to a decentrelized era, and all those middle man which rip us off for every transaction and spy on us and our shopping habits and everything else
do we c i 2 i on this 1? 
@_date: 2018-02-16 07:33:58
all this discussions about cryptos "going to the moon" and that are prices where it will go down or up, are just bunch of baloney’s
as well all this comparing BTC in terms of fiat currency is a wrong, going to 100K or going to 5K, the importance is the amount of people which will use it, because you'll be able to divide them to decimal points below zero, because if you bought it for 10K sold at 100K, but people start trading in BTC again, so you'll buy it with your 100K you sold it
doesnt really matter, dont but them as an investment, buy them to use it in future usage 
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:56:25
stop comparing bitcoin to a stock or an investment, it is just a currency, which mainly will be used in the future which will change the face of the current situation
it'll take some times, banks fight hard agains it, but so was the printed newspapers, look at them now
2.5B people in the world without bank account, and they all going to move to bitcoin by the time they will have cell phones
@_date: 2018-02-20 07:15:09
it's pretty boastful thing from you to say, it's a term that just exposes emotions, the world i changing mate, and if youre an old or unable to adjust to the new world, all is good
each country has its own phrases(in russia you have blen, in arab countries u have kos emek, and the list goes on)
and Canada mate, sorry, but its a place that is not really impacting or contributing anything to the world
@_date: 2018-02-25 15:15:25
ure so right with the token and all, and that bit coin is already established etc
Im not disagreeing with u,  but the block-chain it self doesnt need miners, it's a tech that just work as a  ledger transferring data, its a secure and decentralized way of switching values, crypto is one if them, but also contracts, healthdata and so many more 
@_date: 2018-02-16 21:23:18
really it cracks me up the way people are here looking at things, about stability, tell it to the Indian people when they wanted to pull out some cash back than, but the bank was closed on them,
tell it to people in Venezuela, Argentina you want me to continue?
the first USD  was printed in 1914, year after the federal reserve has been formed, and thank to WW1 it became the world reserve because people were borrowing it again US treasuries,   Despite large deficit spending, trillions of dollars in foreign debt and the unbridled printing of U.S. dollars, U.S. Treasury securities remain the safest store of money because of the trust and confidence that the world has in the ability of the United States to pay its debts
and this is my friend, something that will change, just let the hype calm down, you'll see what will happen
@_date: 2018-02-25 16:54:06
yes my friend, you are right,
pop pos must have miners, btw pop i think is the best option from the two, because pos the rich has the say
I remembered closed consensus dont need miners, but I rechecked and was wrong, 
sorry :/
@_date: 2018-02-20 19:04:47
haha I liked ur summery mate
didnt intend to insult the Canadian people by any mean, said it in a sarcastic way, sorry it sounded rude, you are right, I dont know about your country,
admit i was wrong, forgive me for that,
@_date: 2018-02-16 07:50:06
it's the statistics my friend
we have 7.6B people in the world, do the math
and people dont use BTC, because there are not enough business yet, it is a process it wont change over night, the young generation understands it
@_date: 2018-02-21 21:06:17
@_date: 2018-02-16 07:53:16
this is your point of view, and I accept it, meanwhile BTC is certainly unstable, people are into cryptos not, because its "hot"
you see many countries that are starting to adopt it, it's baby steps 
@_date: 2018-02-23 22:18:30
@_date: 2018-02-15 10:02:57
paypal charges fees, banks charge fees
cryot's are not the future, it's already the present
our generation will be the one benefits from it
but we still gotta lots of work and research to do
the main issue with the bitcoin is the mining, we will have to figure it out, but it's an opportunity, to invent more efficient servers, make use of alternative energy, oh dear Im just waiting for it to come
@_date: 2018-02-15 09:58:35
ROFL comment like urs, make it so funny
cryptos are investmenrss
@_date: 2018-02-16 21:35:54
it's kinda of disturbing all this thing, them patenting so much,
they do it in purpose to kill innovation, the "house"  understands when it will catch up eventually, they wont be able to "bank" on it, and ohh boy what the wall street guys will do, will be unemployed, it's such a lose for society lol,
@_date: 2018-02-22 21:46:37
woww woww, so many commentators, BTC is not only driven by "uneducated" young people. you think millenials are some spol little brats, lazy and whatever,
but we are the generation that will form the future, and eventually crypto currency, doesn’t matter BTC or other, will be the terms of business doing, all this mediators like banks,credit card, insurance, pay-pal and what so over should be vanished,  
dont forget that many people who embrace crypto, are people that dont speculate, but find it as the best way, and secure,meaning, people in Venezuela, china, India,  and more
bte read the news, more and more European countries are starting to consider how to merge crypto into their systems, one world wide currency will be eventually what we will have, or we will keep on being slaves of the banks

as some here say the guy is trippin badly
there's no connection between his brain, blockchain is a technology, it have so much other uses rather than only ctypto's, I guess this guy invested badly in BTC when it was at 10+, thought it will go to the moon
@_date: 2018-04-28 19:02:46
so true, when the old lady in the corner tells you about btc, you know it's everywhere
and it was like that few months ago, people checking in "to the moon" flights
thanks for the link mate, good to know
