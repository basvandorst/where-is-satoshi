I don't think it's a hoax. It's just too big of a thing to pull off. So what did he say about you??? He seemed to know stuff about me, my friends, and most people in the world.

I didn't hear the story about the goats! I heard the one about you, a donkey, some show, and LSD.

I wouldn't be surprised if someone out there though Satoshi was god.

What are you talking about?! Almost everyone got the same email today and so everyone learned about bitcoins today. It's all over the news.

I originally got the domain for my cat. I was planning on making a webcomic about my talking cat, Satoshi! But the A.I. Satoshi beat me to the punch, so I just decided to make a blog about him instead because the domain name fit so well. It's strange, but I guess that's how it goes in this new crazy world of ours. Who knows...maybe I'm psychic :)

Even that one thing about that one thing during that one time? Wow!

Don't get drunk and send your bitcoins to the wrong address!

I don't know about any keys, but who else could send emails to almost everyone in the world at the same time other than an A.I.? I don't even think the government could do that! People on the news seem to think it's really Satoshi. I guess we'll find out tomorrow.

Holy cow [Free Talk Live]( is down. I wonder if the government shut them down because they don't want them broadcasting Satoshi's call tomorrow. What a crazy day!
