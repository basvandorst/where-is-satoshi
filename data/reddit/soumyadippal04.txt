If your wallet is password protected and your electrum application isn't opened in the background, then you are in the safe zone. You might wanna upgrade your electrum to 3.0.5 though, since 3.0.4 is still vulnerable to some extent.

Unfortunately, you cannot send it due to marginably high fee. Either consider it lost and forget about it, or send $20-30 worth of bitcoins to your wallet and then withdraw it altogether.

You just uninstall your previous electrum application fron your control panel and download the latest version from: 
Just install it as usual and you will be fine. No need to worry about your wallet getting destroyed since by uninstalling electrum, it doesn't delete any wallets from your electrum_data folder.

It affects on both PC and android versions. They have already pushed an update on the android side as well.

Heuristic virus isn't really a virus in true sense. It's a false positive. I reported it to Norton as false positive and they updated their database already, accepting my request. Consider live updating your Norton Antivirus for that false alarm to disappear.

During these tough times, just convert a portion of your salary (that is needed for your daily expenses) into fiat, without accounting for losses in your mind. Losses are kind of subjective here. When good times arrive, you'll make up for it. 
P.S. My source of income is BTC as well and I know how it feels to not cash out early during these times. But I remain optimistic and make up my losses when prices rise up at a later point.

I don't think so. People will just stop complaining about high fees and that's it.
