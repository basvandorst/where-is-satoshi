I guess the App Store itself could have some sort of 2fa mechanism but that will never happen. Conversions would go through the floor.
@_date: 2016-08-11 07:02:30
You could theoretically put your own anything on the app store which makes it through the review process.

It appears they have (see the recent edits by OP)
@_date: 2016-08-05 16:27:48
Forking our code isn't a scam and we've encouraged it. However, we've verified that when you try to send money using these apps they instead choose a different address and send there, _and it's gone_.
@_date: 2016-08-05 19:38:16
Users should report these apps, as we're trying to get people to do, then Apple will take the correct action against the developer accounts.
@_date: 2016-08-06 01:32:34
I'm hoping that, in the future, apple adds some sort of "verified" badge for financial apps, or has a special subcategory for apps which deal directly with sensitive information like banking apps, bitcoin apps, etc.

Goodness, we've _proven_ to you that this isn't a bug... you were never given an 11 word seed. Yes, sometimes wallets can take a long time to sync, that is the nature of decentralized apps like ours.
And we're not placing any blame here... accidents happen. That's why we have the 11 word recovery tool and a support staff to walk our customers through when they have problems like this.
What _isn't_ ok however is your carpet-bombing of BRD all over reddit without even considering that _maybe you missed a fucking word_, or offering ANY evidence to any of your perceived problems, including:
 * No evidence that BRD gave you 11 words (you say other people have reported this issue - where are they?)
 * No evidence that you lost any money through BRD (where is the transaction, when did this happen?)

No one else has. Please see the reply up top from @_date: 2018-05-30 01:16:56
Our app has never had an 11 word bug. You have simply convinced yourself that you wrote down the entire phrase, when clearly you've missed a word. There is a tool for this exact scenario, which our support has very patiently coached you through using and restoring access to your wallet. And yet, you persist, why?

Hey, Sam from breadwallet here. Addresses don't necessarily correlate directly to your "wallet" and have little to do with your balance. This is because breadwallet is a "HD" wallet or "hierarchical deterministic" in which new addresses are generated each time you receive money to protect your privacy.
That being said, if you are having trouble viewing incoming transactions please contact support and we'll help you resolve the issue.
@_date: 2017-03-27 15:01:31
That's how all SPV wallets work.
@_date: 2017-03-27 20:08:02
Nope we don't add an additional fee to any of our services. 
@_date: 2017-03-27 22:13:24

You can test it now if you have Marshmallow. We'll be vetting our wallet implementation for a little while and will post again once we have a wide release.
@_date: 2016-06-22 21:43:47
We didn't write or solicit this article, so the text of the article is up to the author. Here is some more helpful info:
We are allowing the first 1000 people in who download it from the play store link (which you can find in a neighboring comment in this thread). This is our "open beta" period and allows for us to test on a wider range of devices and use cases before we do a wide release. We're doing it this way so we can polish it and be as confident as possible in the safety and security of our wallet before doing an wide release.
@_date: 2016-06-21 22:53:48
The seed is supported by any BIP39 wallet which supports the standard BIP32 layout.
@_date: 2016-06-22 22:21:50
This is the reason our app is only available on Android Marshmallow (6.0) and newer devices. Marshmallow critically requires devices support verified boot and a hardware encrypted key store, both of which are backed by a [secure element](
@_date: 2016-06-21 23:57:38
Our layout is [not BIP44](
@_date: 2016-06-22 22:57:40
After the wide release we will make the github repo public
@_date: 2016-06-26 23:30:54
True, but not a great option for Android. It's _nearly_ there for iOS, though (if Apple were to embellish their runtime _just a little_).
@_date: 2016-06-29 20:25:17
Let me help clarify this for you. The people behind breadwallet (of which, I am one, and can speak authoritatively on the subject, and on behalf) are _absolutely not_ advocating for KYC/AML _at any level_.
BIP 75 takes BIP 70, makes it bidirectional, and encrypts it. To facilitate this, it adds some additional payment protocol messages types: InvoiceRequest, ProtocolMessage and EncryptedProtocolMessage. InvoiceRequest is what makes it bidirectional, and EncryptedProtocolMessage is what protects your identity when sending an InvoiceRequest.
This allows for the out-of-band (off-chain) exchange of payment information, securely. No identity information ends up on the bitcoin blockchain. Pretty neat right?
To further clarify, BIP 70-75 (payment protocol BIPs) are used only for the facilitation of payment information, and are not a part of the bitcoin protocol itself (that's why we call it the payment protocol).
@_date: 2016-06-22 21:40:35
Hey, Sam from breadwallet here. Happy to answer any questions.
Here are the important details:
 * To download [tap this link on an Android device](
 * Only the first 1000 users will be left in until we do a wider release
 * The app is Marshmallow-or-newer only
@_date: 2016-06-21 22:52:15
Once you install breadwallet on your iOS device, no one besides you can remove it. Breadwallet will be around for much longer than 5 years. However, if something were to happen to us, because the app connects directly to the bitcoin network, our existence does not preclude your ability to use the app.
@_date: 2016-06-22 22:04:48
No plans as of now for a desktop wallet. Since desktop computers are not malware-hardedned devices, it would not allow us to honor our commitment to easy, safe and secure access to Bitcoin for our users.
@_date: 2017-08-23 15:36:37
This guy posted a smear thread about breadwallet yesterday. Why are you doing this?
During any fork people are advised to not make any transactions until the dust settles no matter which wallet you use. We now have experience with forks and will be communicating regularly with our customers during this period. You can expect instruction from us on how to handle the fork.
For instance with BCH we had to implement an extra layer of node selection because BCH nodes were accidentally connecting to the bitcoin network and it was making some transactions appear to succeed when they are not.
The bottom line is that "your keys your coin" as has been said before. With breadwallet you control the keys. If you need to send coin during the split you can always tie your breadwallet to a specific node on the chain you wish and use that to send your transaction. 
Hope this helps!
@_date: 2016-06-22 17:57:13
That is _definitely_ not the case. Breadwallet is alive and well as ever!
@_date: 2016-06-23 02:52:28
Breadwallet is an implementation of a Bitcoin wallet, like elecrum and many others. Breadwallet is [open source]( and runs entirely on your phone (doesn't depend on a 3rd party for access to your money). It's also one of the easiest and safest to use wallets which makes it great for beginners.
@_date: 2016-06-26 22:12:22
There are revised security APIs and best practices, but critically MM enforces device manufacturers have hardware-encryption-backed key storage, and a verified boot chain. 
@_date: 2016-06-29 20:31:50
BIP 70-75 (the payment protocol, which is distinctly _not_ "the bitcoin protocol") would not be appropriate for government use.
Governments using bitcoin as a currency would likely have a protocol of their own. But you wouldn't have to use it. Because you can exchange payment information in your own way. Because bitcoin is designed to be naturally censorship-resistent.
@_date: 2016-06-29 21:48:58
I'm breadwallet's CTO. Please take a minute and read some of my other responses on this thread. Our position is obviously privacy-focused which is probably one of the reasons you used and recommended breadwallet in the first place. We value that more than you could imagine.
@_date: 2016-06-22 18:02:17
Unless there is some known remote, untethered, unattended exploit (which there never has been for iOS) it would be safe to reconnect to the network. Generally you should only use your receive address once per transaction. 
@_date: 2016-06-29 21:42:53
We _do not_ advocate for KYC/AML, and _never will_. breadwallet is widely respected as one-of-the most privacy-respecting wallets out there, and we fight hard for that designation. Literally every day we discuss in some way or another how to better protect the privacy of not just our users, but of all users of bitcoin. You can rest-assured that our actions will always be made in the effort of upholding this promise.
The payment protocol BIP family (currently BIP 70-75) are designed to facilitate the out-of-band exchange of payment information. BIP 75 simply takes BIP 70, encrypts it, and makes it bidirectional. See some of my other comments on this thread where I give a more in-depth explanation.
@_date: 2016-06-23 16:35:50
Yes we are using fingerprint similar to how we are using TouchID on iOS.
@_date: 2017-08-23 22:34:07
You can maintain _your position all you want_. It doesn't make it a valid statement in the least. Breadwallet users have yet to loose money using our product. We have a very good track record see nothing as more important than keeping that record of safety and security.
@_date: 2016-06-21 22:16:39
[source: I am the CTO of breadwallet]
This is a great way to "air gap" your bitcoins in cold storage. We have a lot of people (myself included) who simply keep an older iPod touch in a safe to save their coins, which is a little more convenient since you can open up the wallet and deposit or transfer a balance to your day-to-day wallet. Of course, be sure to write down your phrase and store it securely in a separate location.
Please note that you should NOT screenshot your QR code so you can make additional transfers to the wallet. Every receive needs to generate a new QR code, and this is the way it should be used so you don't compromise the financial privacy of the wallet.
@_date: 2017-08-23 17:15:31
Yesterday your post literally said breadwallet users will loose money. You clearly want us to take sides. We've been neutral in the past and will continue to be. 
@_date: 2016-06-22 18:00:20

Can we all just agree that forks are not easy, and when they happen, we must all act appropriately? We (breadwallet, I am the CTO) have publicly stated that your money is safe in breadwallet in the event of a fork. It is of no service to make scare posts like this one that only muddy the water for people who don't understand the details. We handled the BCH split elegantly. We intend to do the same if/when S2X happens.

At a minimum, you will want anything that can run iOS 7 or newer (ideally iOS 8/9 or newer).
@_date: 2016-06-29 21:35:55
Fortunately, BIP 75 does not "bake AML/KYC" into "the protocol". The bitcoin protocol and blockchain, which most people mean when they say "the protocol" in the context of bitcoin, are not affected in an way.
All BIP 75 does is build upon BIP 70-74. It provides a way to encrypt the payment protocol (yay, privacy!) and a way to make it bi-directional (yay, decentralization!) This is enabled through a few new payment protocol message types: InvoiceRequest, ProtocolMessage and EncryptedProtocolMessage. The InvoiceRequest allows you to request a PaymentRequest from a 3rd party. InvoiceRequests, just like PaymentRequests include a pki_type and pki_data field. The EncryptedProtocolMessage is an encrypted envelope for all payment protocol message types, and protects the entire exchange between wallets.
BIP 75 and its supporters and implementers are provide for the out-of-band exchange of payment information, that's all. _Nothing_ ends up on the bitcoin blockchain that is personally identifying. 
@_date: 2016-11-02 21:12:37
Did we get back with you? Just want to make sure we received it, and I believe I've replied to every report yet.

You won't loose your bitcoin if it's stored in breadwallet... I'm not sure where this idea is coming from.
@_date: 2016-06-26 20:48:34
Our wallets use the BIP32 default layout which isn't compatible with BIP44 wallets like trezor. There is an open github issue on our [iOS repo]( asking for support to import BIP44 wallets, but we're still trying to come up with a good solution that both promotes good security practices and have a seamless user experience.
@_date: 2016-06-26 20:45:34
We have our own implementation of both the wallet and the wallet UI. It's completely new software that has been in progress for a little while. 
@_date: 2016-06-29 21:51:23
Maybe it would help to better understand both the BIP and breadwallet's stance. I'm breadwallet's CTO. My hands are getting a little tired, but in this thread and others I've detailed both, so please take a minute to read through some of my responses.

breadwallet is available on Android too. ALWAYS write down your phrase!
@_date: 2016-11-18 07:17:17
We've been trying to figure out for a while now who it is but there are a lot of dead ends. I imagine Apple could figure it out though.
@_date: 2016-11-22 21:55:25
They could start by requiring stricter identity verification for apps in their financial categories. Apple already does this with their enterprise accounts, not sure why they aren't doing this for any app in financial.
@_date: 2016-11-22 22:29:05
We've examined many other wallets and this one follows all signals exactly as the ones that we've confirmed as scams. We're only providing a warning here. If you disagree then go ahead, download the wallet and use it for your transactions. I'd be interested to hear how that works out for you.
@_date: 2016-12-29 05:08:57
Yes. We are adding the ability to purchase using your US/CA bank account. This should be present in the beta very soon.
@_date: 2016-12-29 05:13:40
ID verification, yes, that is a hard requirement in the US/CA for all customers of this type of product. Bank account verification (via micro deposits) will not be required for the majority of customers, you will just use your username and password.
@_date: 2016-11-02 18:40:52
Hah, I think we leave the issue open more for discussion than anything. 
@_date: 2016-11-02 21:05:36
The app may be removed from the store by apple or us, however no one besides you can remove the app from your phone. Since breadwallet's keys are on your device, you will always have control over your money when using breadwallet.
breadwallet phrases may be recovered using other tools, but we suggest if you are going to use another tool to simply send your money there rather than share the phrase.

@_date: 2016-11-04 00:29:18
What do you mean by reset, and on what platform?
On iOS deleting the wallet will not remove the wallet from the phone (but will lock the wallet requiring a PIN or the phrase to regain access).
On Android deleting the wallet will remove the wallet and reinstalling will require the backup phrase.
@_date: 2016-11-22 21:54:28
It's just all the signals we've described in previous posts about fake wallets. It happens to be a very slightly reskinned version of mycelium iOS.

This is a map of ATMs and a native integration with LibertyX (more native integrations to come).
@_date: 2016-12-29 04:30:22
We utilize partners to provide buy/sell options. Breadwallet works the same as before, where your private keys are stored directly on the device. Whenever you purchase the bitcoin is sent directly to your breadwallet. You will never have to register or create any sort of "account" unless you want to use one of these services.
@_date: 2016-12-15 04:37:57
Our beta is out now. I'm running approval in the next 15 minutes so if you're in the US/CA and have signed up for early access and buy bitcoin then you'll see the buy bitcoin button!

As long as you write down your backup phrase and have a passcode on your phone that isn't all "1"s your bitcoin is safe in breadwallet. Like most here I don't recommend leaving your money on an exchange.
@_date: 2016-12-29 05:06:35
I'd be happy to. What would you like to know?
@_date: 2016-06-29 21:44:15
Funnily enough, the price of bitcoin is almost entirely facilitated by companies with KYC/AML requirements (exchanges and other MSBs).

No. You write down your recovery phrase when you create a breadwallet and store it in a safe place. This can be used to restore your wallet on new devices.

That's surprising, as there are many that do. FWIW at some point when our partners support it we'll also support micro transfers and bank account numbers to establish accounts. The limited number of bank options are due to the complexities of the username/password system (as I eluded to elsewhere in the thread). Also FWIW, this isn't necessarily more "secure."

We don't store your bank login info and neither does our partners. Your bank information is passed to a trusted 3rd party which negotiates the connection to and from your bank account. _We don't even have your bank account numbers_. There are _MANY_ financial services which work with online bank account sign ins and there are in fact standards for dealing with these types of log ins. 
[plaid]( is one such example of this type of online banking flow. There are many others.
You did point out one bug, however, and that is not letting you select your account. This functionality is in the app currently but sometimes not triggered, and that is a bug. Finding bugs is one reason why we're doing a slow rollout. This bug will be fixed in the next few days as we update the software.

All bitcoin wallets have transaction fees because all transactions require fees to be mined (put in the blockchain). Fees are set by the current market conditions such as number of pending transactions, average transaction fees, and average confirmation time of those transactions. Most wallets target 1-2 blocks confirmation which all require a fee. Currently sending a transaction with no fee would result in a transaction that never completes.
Most wallets (such as breadwallet) do not take "additional" fees. These fees all go to the miners whose job it is to secure the bitcoin blockchain. The fees are used to pay for mining hardware (computers) and bandwidth.
@_date: 2017-04-28 23:38:36
Also, I should mention, if we are hacked, none of your information or bitcoin can be stolen. Maybe you're not aware of how our wallet works, but it's a bitcoin wallet that connects directly to the bitcoin network and manages its own private keys. Breadwallet users do not have "accounts" like you might have with coinbase, etc. We actually have no idea who you are since we don't even store your email address or phone number (these are encrypted, and stored locally on your phone). We DEFINITELY don't store any bank account login information. If our servers were hacked the hackers would be sorely disappointed.

If you don't want to buy bitcoin with your bank account, then don't. For the majority of people, the security and convenience match up at the right point where it makes sense for them.

Is the entire world expected to exchange bitcoin for fiat in person?
@_date: 2017-04-29 01:07:32
Just to add another data point here: we can't and our partners can't. Even the companies that provide the bank account connections  can't, as they negotiate a set of permissions and those permissions don't include access to your financial history. Just the ability to send and receive money. Mint is a special case.
@_date: 2017-04-29 01:00:15
No, it works by establishing a connection to your bank which negotiates capabilities (in this case, transfer services). It would be illegal to store bank log in info on record at anywhere besides your bank.
@_date: 2017-04-04 18:08:45
The fees are too high now for it to make economic sense for businesses to pay for your transactions.
@_date: 2017-04-29 05:06:41
username and password vs account numbers has nothing to do with security... no party in the chain persists this information. The credentials are exchanged for an expire-able token.
Anyway, if you give someone your bank account number and routing information, your address, your phone number, your email, and a copy of your ID, and perhaps another bit of identifying info such as part of your tax id, which is what most exchanges require, you've already provided enough information to do quite a bit of damage.

We did it before BIP 44 and just kind of stuck with it. 
Also keep in mind these keys aren't really intended for high portability. We don't recommend you use your bread phrase with other wallets, as it effectively makes the security of your phrase only as secure as the least secure app/device you use it with.
@_date: 2017-09-27 23:09:01
Seriously though don't use any bitcoin wallet on a jailbroken phone

Yes. The link in the footer of our webpage links to our github org. I'll publish the source later today

None of this is relevant to the layman really. People just want their stuff to work.
@_date: 2017-09-27 17:09:40
Tools exist. Even other wallets use unique derivation paths that require the use of tools to convert between apps.

So weird, these posts seem to get auto removed if they say "BCH" instead of "shitcoin".

Bread is nearly as secure as hardware wallets. Also "If you don't own the private keys you don't own your bitcoin" - with breadwallet you own the private key. Just make sure to write down your phrase!
@_date: 2017-09-27 17:07:47
There's no guarantee we'll be around forever, but tools to convert BIP39 phrases probably will be.

Not sure who is spreading this FUD, but you won't loose money if it's stored in breadwallet (source: I am the Bread CTO). During the fork no one should make any bitcoin transactions using any wallet (we will alert our users to this in our app). After the dust has settled from the fork things should continue operating normally.
@_date: 2017-10-01 07:29:05
We will do basically the same as we do before.

It's perfectly safe to leave your bitcoin there. It can't be lost through the hard fork when stored in Bread. source: I am the CTO of Bread (formerly breadwallet) We do however recommend avoiding transactions in the midst of the hard fork since neither side has replay protection.

Apple has a really strong track record for security [on iOS devices] and I have an intimate knowledge of how their security practices and APIs have developed over time (again, on iOS), and have been impressed with how things have mostly been moving in the right direction, advancing the state of the art and dragging the rest of the industry forward. There are occasional egregious fuckups (like the recent default backup configuration change) but that doesn't affect apps like Bread because that keychain data is never backed up.
@_date: 2018-04-23 22:57:59
Well bread does have a pretty sturdy security record, hardware wallets have seen lots of exploits. I personally use bread, and many people do who have orders of magnitude more to loose than myself.

Trying to say it's possible for us to offer verifiable builds on android, but not iOS, though we don't do it for any platform currently. 
And yeah, I feel more comfortable on iOS than Android too, currently. Always write down your paper key and utilize encrypted backups, and you'll be really safe.
@_date: 2017-05-22 22:52:36
Sadly you may just have to wait. If the tx was made with a low-ish fee it could be stuck in the sending queue (up to 14 days) until the coin will be "returned" to you and you can retry (hopefully with a higher fee).
@_date: 2016-05-17 20:50:13
Yes, unfortunately this is a limitation of Apple's hardware. Their NFC implementation is tied heavily to Apple Pay, which is the only consumer of their NFC chip. I assume this is for Apple's own security reasons having to do with how closely integrated NFC and the "secure enclave" is which stores your CC info for Apple Pay. Maybe some day we'll get access to it.
@_date: 2018-04-17 18:32:35
Hey, CTO of Bread here. There is no 100% sure way to do a deterministic build of the app (for iOS) and no 100% way to even verify the app, as apple modifies the binaries after upload. However only we (Bread) can upload to our app store account because only we have control over the private key that allows us to publish apps with account on the store. 
Therefore, you are trusting only two parties (Bread and Apple). The truly paranoid may also wish to audit and build the code themselves, which anyone is free to do. That being said, Bread is a very reputable company at this point, as one of the longest standing (and as of yet un-hacked) crypto currency wallets out there.

breadwallet uses bitpay rates. We do this because when you spend bitcoins in real life you are usually quoted the bitpay rate or something very close to it. Coinbase has had a higher rate than bitpay during this volatility. Don't worry, however, you have exactly the same amount of bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-05-17 19:42:37

@_date: 2017-07-08 18:12:25
Yes it is perfectly safe. I'm not sure where everyone else is misunderstanding: breadwallet gives you total control over your coins since you control the "private key" of the wallet. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 21:50:57
If it's just storing, then you don't have to do anything.
@_date: 2016-05-17 20:54:58
Hi - sorry to hear that transactions are taking long. We believe that sending and receiving bitcoin should be seamless, that transaction fees are an implementation detail the user need not worry about. This is why we automatically choose a fee for each transaction. Most transactions sent with breadwallet end up confirmed within 10-20 minutes. If you are experiencing longer confirmation times this is definitely something we want to address, and would ask that you please contact support so we can learn more.
@_date: 2017-07-31 01:45:10
This. Your coins are safe in breadwallet. If the fork survives we will release a separate app allowing you access to BCC.

At rest the private key should be highly safe. breadwallet _could_ still certainly be vulnerable to certain types of malware, but it's much less likely with the combination of a verified boot and hardware encryption.
@_date: 2016-07-21 23:48:21
Depends on how you set it up.

As mentioned by others, marshmallow brings the requirement of hardware-backed encryption, verified boot chain, and access to the trusted elements, none of which were requirements for previous versions of android, and all of which were necessary for us to feel safe releasing a version of breadwallet for android.

With Coinbase your money is in the hands of the company: Coinbase. They manage your keys and therefore your money. We call this a "custodial" wallet. With breadwallet, your money is on your actual device. The way I do it is, if I want to buy bitcoin I may use coinbase, then send it to my breadwallet.

W.R.T. forks we'll allow you to select a specific node if you want to lock your wallet to a node with the ruleset you desire. Otherwise your wallet will automatically follow the longest chain. We suggest not moving your bitcoins until the dust settles in the event of a chain split.
