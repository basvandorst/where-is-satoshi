Imagine writing those options! The IVs would be off the chain! Does anyone with option writing experience have any ballpark figure for premiums at this stage? Futures are a game changer for the unregulated Crypto Currency paradigm, this is an exciting time to see what’s gonna happen on Dec 10th. As both an investor and general enthusiast this is a wild ride!

One way to look at it is the market cap of global money markets, gold of 2.4 trillion billion or even the derivatives market of $4 quadrillion or whatever else you wanna equate the value of bitcoin to.. I dont know too much but i believe if bitcoin displaced all fiat (not including the unbanked people crypto will bring into the financial world), then it could be easily worth 100k+ per BTC

Wow I was initially really concerned about the impact of futures on the price of the underlying asset given the asset itself is only extrinsically valuable and can be manipulated- however it seems there are MULTIPLE barriers to entry in shorting the futures market. Firstly: &gt;"Two-minute trading breaks will kick in if the daily price moves 7 percent away from the previous day's settlement price, then again at 13 percent and a hard limit at 20 percent when all trading will cease unless trading can restart within that band." Secondly as OP mentioned some banks are refusing access and thirdly, CME is setting required margin at min 35%! 7 times higher than that trading oil or mini S&amp;P equity futures!

Ah okay.. I read the original post "Go short on CME" as Shorting through Options as opposed to true Shorting in the sense of borrowing the stock itself

Alert: Those who are in power want to maintain the status quo
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:04:09
It just concerns me that all the existint big money is either gonna prompt regulation or manipulate bitcoin to preserve the status quo or get in now and get a huuuge piece of the pie while its still relatively young

There is an arbitrage due to the various exchanges offering different prices

Sorry why does there need to be a long for every short?

Bulls wouldnt spend bitcoin at this stage its too volatile to be a currency exchance dont you think? And if you are bearish on the market then are you not worried about your revenue literally depreciating to potentially below your cost price on the goods? Assuming your cost prices are in a while different ball park from Baba or Amzn too thats not going to be easy! Interested in your thoughts- not trying to bash you or anything. Love the innovation and wish you all the best!

I cant wait for the shit show that is futures and hope we see something similar to 2013 post Silk Rd/Mt Gox. As a Crypto fan obviously its not great for mass adoption and public perception going forward- but the changes we are about to see in the coming weeks are extremely interesting!

Do you trust holding your coins on an exchange or do you actually want sole and exclusive control/security of your private keys? If you believe CryptoCurrency is the future and are going hard in then invest $100 in a hardware wallet like Trezor or Ledger Nano for your own good! If you still trust existing systems that are generally secure but can potentially be compromised, then go ahead with the iOS wallet!
