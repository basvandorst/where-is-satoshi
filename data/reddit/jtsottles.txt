The arbitrage scenario you describe would create a downside trade for GOX and quickly correct the arbitrage. 
the real reason for the arbitrage is because of the difficulty of withdrawing USD. You could only withdraw by wire transfer which is costly to most consumer investors. 
Buy BTC on Bitstamp = upside tick for Bitstamp.
Transfer to GOX = no change in price.
Sell on GOX = downside tick for GOX.
price gap narrows.
The more this happens, the smaller the arbitrage.
What is really happening (pre-shutdown).
Coins are being bought and sold on GOX for up and down ticks. Trading is happening and people are either gaining or losing BTC in the long run.
Investor decides to cash out, but cannot cash out in USD (unless he or she does a bank wire transfer). 
Investor BUYS as much BTC as the account has fiat to do so = uptick for GOX.
Investor transfers to USD based wallet like Bitstamp = no change in market.
Investor SELLS on Exchange like Bitstamp with better USD withdraw = down tick for Bitstamp.
arbitrage  achieved.

Considering that prior to the bitcoin withdraw issue, there were wide spread reports of fiat withdraw issues, I would think you are about right. 
An important point here is that if there is a mass exodus, the price will rise dramatically, because the holders will need to buy BTC to transfer. If you have a GOX account, you likely sold at sold at some point of the decline. In order to transfer out, you will need to buy BTC (considering the pre-existing fiat withdraw issues). 
I believe this process can take 2-3 days and will drive the market up on all exchanges.

Yes, as the 2-3 day window closes, it will, except for those who just want out of GOX and still believe in BTC.The price will trend up as the GOX price reverse arbitrage narrows. Don't follow my 2-3 day guide. I would look to the price becoming more 1:1 on GOX:US Facing Exchanges, then the price may start falling (baring any other outside influences). It really depends on who simply want out and who still stays in.

And would a Baltimore Meetup be better for you? 
How many people does the Arlington Meetup get?

The price of the other exchanges will trend up because a majority of people do not realize this barrier and will look at GOX price as healthy. The other exchanges are about 250 ahead. as gox price goes up, the price will follow along, narrowing the gap.

Nope. Looks real cool but I am at a dead end.

I have been using CEX.io and came across this page. However I find no documentation and cannot ascertain from the code what exactly should be input in the login field to execute trades against my account. has anyone used this before?
It seems to work if I put any bogus login id in the login field. If I put my own, I do not see how it determines my password, and of course I see no trades in my account when it executed a trade.
