I have a fairly small amount I've invested, but only through Coinbase. Should I transfer it; is Coinbase not dependable? And how do I go about doing that?

I feel your pain... I definitely would have bought a good amount just to have them. I was 11 and really had no idea knowledge of cryptocurrency.

It's kind of difficult for me to believe that someone mistyped a crypto address that it sent to a completely different person.

The last time I really thought about it, I remember it being early last year and it was at $300 something. I thought about it, then changed my mind, then it went up to $800+ and I thought "well, it's too high now". Then I forgot about it until somewhere around the $7k/8k mark and it just keeps making me regret a lot now.

I would if I had a lot of it! But I'm currently at around 0.01something of one because I invested so late in the game and I am also a broke college student ��

But seeing my money keep falling right now is certainly not that great of a feeling, though.

Can we at least just stay over 10k, goddamn 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:43:40
Same exact thing, actually. And Coinbase isn't letting me buy more right now, keeps giving me errors. It's not a bad thing, it'll just take time to go up again like it usually does. It's a good time to buy cheaper, though, so let's give it some time.

Trying to buy but everything is fucking down aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

Never gotten people who do shit like this; always gives me such secondhand embarrassment. Do they not think their motives are extremely obvious? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:50:49
It's just a bit of a dip for now, no need to panic ��
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:48:25
Lots of people cashing out fast, I presume. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:01:42
There's probably just a ton of traffic right now. It is making me a little nervous, though. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:48:59
I distinctly remember reading a post on here sometime early-ish last year when it was something around $300/$400, and people were talking about investing in it because it was definitely going to go up soon and become big. Kicking myself now for never getting involved, but I'm also a broke college student now and I was then, so there's that.

Finally got around to buying and it falls under 10k again. Fml ��
