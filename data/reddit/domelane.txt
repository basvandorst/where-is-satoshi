Bitcoin is a worldwide-distributed decentralized peer-to-peer censorship-resistant trustless and permissionless deflationary system/currency (see Blockchain technology) backed by mathematics, open source code, cryptography and the most powerful and secure decentralized computational network on the planet, orders of magnitude more powerful than google and government combined. There is a limit of 21 million bitcoins (divisible in smaller units). "Backed by Government" money is not backed by anything and is infinitely printed at will by Central Banks. Bitcoin is limited and decentralized.
**Receive and transfer money, from cents (micropayments) to thousands:**
* Low cost regardless of amount $$$ sent (with new apps coming)
* Borderless (no country can stop it from going in/out or confiscate)
* Trustless (nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work)
* Privacy (no need to expose personal information)
* Securely (encrypted cryptographically and can’t be confiscated)
* Permissionless (no approval from central powers needed)
* Instantly (from seconds to a few minutes)
* Open source (auditable by anybody)
* Worldwide distributed (from anywhere to anywhere on the planet)
* Censorship resistant (no government can stop its use)
* Peer-to-peer (no intermediaries with a cut)
* Portable (easier to carry/move than cash, gold and silver)
* Public ledger (transparent, seen by everybody)
* Scalable (each bitcoin is divisible down to 8 decimals)
* Decentralized (distributed with no single point of failure)
* Deflationary (its supply goes down with time until reaching 21 million ever)
* Immutable global registry (can’t be altered/hacked by nobody)
* No chargebacks-No fraud ('push' vs' 'pull' transactions).﻿
*And that’s just as currency, Bitcoin has many more uses and applications.*

What about the ones debt-free (or even rich) due to crypto investments.
@_date: 2018-01-31 17:54:09


That's the exact same thing people said when it hit $1 in 2009, then $10, then $100, then $1000, now over $10,000 and will continue to say at $100,000, $1000,000...﻿and so on.
Everybody parroting: "The bitcoin bubble is about to pop" since 2009, don't know that bitcoin is a decentralized system with mathematically fixed, deflationary and limited supply currency and its growth is exponential.
So is not farfetched to say that it will be at 100,000 by 2020, since it came from less than $1 to $10,000 in less than 10 years, and it hasn't even hit the bottom part of the exponential 'S-Curve' of adoption.

Learn from [history]( and listen to this [absolute Boss]( There will never be enough Bitcoin for every existing millionaire to own just ONE SINGLE BITCOIN, [Total number of millionaires (in USD value) worldwide is around 33 million]( BTC is the [best money](

 &gt; &gt; **Follow this basic rules of Bitcoin**:


 


 




 &gt; &gt; Everybody parroting: "The bitcoin [bubble]( is about to [pop]( since 2009, don't know that bitcoin is a decentralized system with mathematically fixed, deflationary and limited supply currency and its growth is [exponential]( not linear.

This is good, all those institutional traders coming in will push the price higher.
@_date: 2018-01-26 10:40:20


It looks like you need to do some reading, Bitcoin’s value derives from its current real uses (mainly for money transfers and remittances) its limited supply and scarcity (store of value) and its many potential uses. Also, behind the curtains there is a huge growth in the bitcoin ecosystem development that a regular folk can't see because it's ignored by the media.
If you buy for day trading you may lose money, but if you hold long term, it has been proven you get nice ROI. And bitcoin has barely started, think of the Internet/email in the 90's. A decentralized technology that has a valuable use it's not going to disappear, even if a few tyrannical governments try to "ban" it.

Agree, and there is this new prediction:
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:10:38
If you are new, this is a good point of entry:
 It is always a good time to buy (the real Bitcoin, not Bcash), we are NOT in a "bubble" (fiat is *the* [real bubble]( the answer is: Buy now, always [Hodl](
 ) in [FUD times](
  (Bitcoin has ["died"]( many times, but [Moneybadger]( don't care, [buy the dips]( and **never panic-sell**, stuff like: ["China/Korea ban Bitcoin...again!"]( will [keep happening]( again and [again]( 


 &gt; Stick to the [real Bitcoin]( through all the ['forks' and 'splits']( that accomplish nothing but new mediocre, unsafe and centralized altcoins, [strengthen/immunize](  Bitcoin and give you free altcoins to buy more Bitcoin.


 &gt; All [Central Powers look silly]( trying to [control]( or [ban]( it. Learn from [history]( and listen to this [absolute Boss]( There will never be enough Bitcoin for every existing millionaire to own just ONE SINGLE BITCOIN, [Total number of millionaires (in USD value) worldwide is around 33 million]( BTC is the [best money](
 &gt; 
 &gt; Also relax, you are actually an [early adopter]( BTC is still [relatively small](  [mentally prepare]( yourself for healthy and expected market volatility/dips/corrections/"crashes" (check out this amazing ['Corrections Trends Perspective']( and remember all this:


 &gt; &gt; **Follow this basic rules of Bitcoin**:


 


 




 &gt; &gt; Everybody parroting: "The bitcoin [bubble]( is about to [pop]( since 2009, don't know that bitcoin is a decentralized system with mathematically fixed, deflationary and limited supply currency and its growth is [exponential]( not linear. 






 &gt; &gt;  So is not farfetched to say that it will be at 100,000 by 2020,  since it came from less than $1 to $5,000 in less than 10 years, and it hasn't even hit the bottom part of the exponential ['S-Curve' of adoption]
 &gt; &gt; (
 &gt; &gt; Check out this great 2017 MIT study: ["The Cryptocurrency Market Is Growing Exponentially"]( Patience [pays]( don't listen to most ["Expert Analysts"]  ( or [MSM"](
 &gt; &gt; Bitcoin is a [Moneybadger]( that get's stronger and immunized with [every new attack](




 &gt; &gt; [Bitcoin has outperformed every other currency, commodity, stock and asset since its inception in 2009]( Bitcoin, the [Moneybadger]( is the first unseizable store of value in human history, unlike gold, equities, or fiat, it can't be confiscated if stored correctly. How banks think [blockchain will disrupt their industry]( Check out these Bitcoin [Economy]( and Bitcoin [Transaction]( infographics.




 &gt; &gt; Also, remember its [fixed, limited supply of 21 million coins ever,]( there are just ~4.5 million (~20%)  bitcoins left to be mined till 2140 and the production will keep decreasing ("halving") every [4 years till then](  So, remember [this]( and [don't wait for the Bitcoin "bubble" to burst]( or for the price to drop significantly again, because you could be waiting forever:

The market is still very small, 500 billion for all crypto coins, as the market grows, volume/liquidity increases and volatility and effects of manipulation decrease.
There are more Hoddlers every day in many Countries, also more buyers clogging the exchanges waiting to be verified to get some, and Bitcoin is becoming more scarce with only 4 million left to mine and the next halving coming that will reduce the supply to only 6.25 btc per block. Bitcoin's growth is exponential, [this logarithmic graphic]( has been accurate for years, so do the math. We are [here](
Also, China will be coming [back in the game]( sooner or later.
@_date: 2018-01-31 21:15:18
We have a huge flood of [fud trolls]( 
You are repeating the exact same things fudders said when it hit $1 in 2009, then $10, then $100, then $1000, now over $10,000 and will continue to say at $100,000, $1000,000...﻿and so on.
Everybody parroting: "The bitcoin bubble is about to pop" since 2009, don't know that bitcoin is a decentralized system with mathematically fixed, deflationary and limited supply currency and its growth is exponential.

That's not true, Bitcoin is the best, safest and most convenient store of value in Human history. That alone makes BTC very undervalued at $20,000 USD. That's how we use it right now, before all the scaling applications coming on second layers. I couldn't care less about buying a coffee with my Bitcoin right now.

It is missing an infinity of factors more important than any 'technical analysis', this is just one of them: The herd is coming (and actually not only one, buy many different herds), the exponential growth will take the price higher. 
 This old [logarithmic scale]( has been accurate [so far]( as well as analysts like Wall Street strategist [Tom Lee]( by using [Metcalfe's Law]( "The value of a telecommunications network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system (n2)" [wiki-link] ( He explains it clearer [here](

Exactly. "Bitcoin Bubble Crashes!!" That's the exact same thing people said when it hit ATH $1 in 2009, then $10, then $100, then $1000 now around $10,000 and will continue to say at $100,000, $1,000,000...﻿and so on. Bitcoin growth is not linear, it's exponential.
What most people crying "Bitcoin is a bubble!" don't know is that bitcoin is a decentralized system with limited supply currency and of exponential growth. So is not farfetched to say that it will be at 100,000 by 2020,  since it came from less than $1 to $10,000 in less than 10 years, and it hasn't even hit the bottom part of the exponential 'S-Curve' of technology adoption

He is a [fud-troll](
@_date: 2018-02-13 14:38:33
Where did you pull that fud out of?
@_date: 2018-02-13 13:11:09
Buy now.
@_date: 2018-02-14 17:58:00
That doesn't matter for the long term, just Hodl.

Well... it didn't happen, he was right and you are just spreading FUD on your comments.

Read how the powerful Roman Empire collapsed. The US is following the exact same steps.

Yes, it will be, but we Hodlers don't give a fuck about daily fluctuations. This will be the best year ever for Bitcoin, as it will be the next and 2020=REAL MOON (&gt;$100,000) with the next halvening.

[Looks nice](

Let me share a sober data point - EVERYONE who bought since the beginning of bitcoin in 2009 till this las November are in the green at this moment. The only people in the red are those who bought during December and January. That's right, 2 months in the red vs all bitcoin's history in the green. Sobering, right?

This is the last chance ever to bet bitcoin under $10,000. As 2016 was the last chance ever to get it under $1,000

Dude, you are [butthurt because you sold]( on September and shorted Bitcoin, I have you tagged, and you've been spreading fud since, hoping for the price to go down and buy back. 
You sold and shorted on 9/13/17 to be precise.
Edit: You and a horde of fudders are downvoting all these posts that debunk the fake news and seeding more fud in the comments.
@_date: 2018-02-11 13:43:51
I think exactly the opposite. I saw that you sold, you better get some before the coming bull run.

You are a fud-troll, I love tags, you [predicted]( Bitcoin's fall and failed miserably:

You are not, you don't own any bitcoin, you are here to [seed panic](
Edit: Close your short, it is going back up, the "India-Ban" was fake news:
