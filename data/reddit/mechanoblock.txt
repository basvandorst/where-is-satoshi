Volatility is not a problem with the US dollar. While it is true the commodity prices are volatile, that argument does not translate into the real world because we use money, not commodities, for purchases. I don’t pay my rent with gasoline or gold. I pay my rent with stable US dollars.
I might consider using bitpay. If bitcoin pumps, I can use it to make a purchase and at the time of sale the conversion rate is applied. Is that how it works?

The activism by Nouriel Is likely to have the opposite effect.  If a bitcoin ETF is going to be approved, he might be the person who helps that along with his activism.
Does he have a short position in bitcoin?

I think the opposite is true. I think when the economy crashes, people will liquidate emerging growth and speculative and risky positions to pay for their basic needs.
I can’t pay rent or buy food with bitcoin.

I see no rationale in your post.
But if enough people buy into this groupthink and HODL "religion" and buy bitcoin, bitcoin's price in USD (or other such stable currency) will go up.
The reason that I began buying bitcoin was just that: I believed that enough other people believed that bitcoin would go up, that they would buy, and that this would drive price up. I had an acquaintance provided real evidence as to the mental process of the zealous HODLer. 
I've lost about $40,000 so far. So much for that :-(
My acquaintance said bitcoin was the future, it was going up, HODL, and all kinds of irrational stuff that sounded more like zealotry or John McAfee (incidentally, my acquaintance is religious and believes that the earth is flat).
So now I'm caught where I can see that BTC is resting on long-term support. The economy is weak. I think we may break that support and I think that if the economy crashes, this is more likely, as people will need money (not bitcoin) to pay for consumer staples.
 
TL;DR "Don't be stupid" doesn't provide any probabilistic indication of where price is headed. It's not logical or reasonable. It's actually stupid.

I am here because I trade cryptocurrency. I need Money.
Should I be long or short? And why? These are questions that I ask on a daily basis. I am not stuck on either side but I am more pessimistic than most cryptocurrency Speculators. I am not an investor; I speculate and Gamble
@_date: 2018-10-16 00:11:20
Nouriel comes off biased and predisposed. Definitely not neutral and objective. Sometimes he sounds desperate. I never seem him try to see things from another perspective.  Zealotry, either for or against anything, raises a red flag.
Jim Rickards presents much more reasonable arguments against bitcoin. He dropped some gems that were worth looking at. He doesn't keep on preaching "Bitcoin is awful" all over social media like his life depends on it., like Nouriel does. Is Nouriel really OK? 
Could bitcoin be the new world  currency? Maybe. Maybe we'll end up having lightning network and all our purchases will be done by fingerprint, tied through amazon serving us on its network. Or maybe the economy will crash, triggering a massive selloff, pushing the snooze button on decentralized cryptocurrency for another 5 years.
About bitcoin, I'm not too optimistic. It's worthless now and I'm leaning towards the likelihood that bitcoin will crash. But I know perhaps about as much as any average crypto enthusiast and trader, so don't take my advice.

“Should be“ is not reality. Purchases in the United States are made in USD.
@_date: 2018-10-16 07:06:15
That is a bald assertion.

Do they work? And how?
I tried purse.io many times. I eventually got burnt by them. Their operation is not, how shall I say… it’s not a good organization.
What purse will do is when bitcoin valuation drops by some amount determined by purse, after any purchase, they will cancel the order and ask for more than The customer originally agreed to pay. I think this is unfair. 
Purse’s practices showcase the impracticality of bitcoin, due to bitcoin’s volatility.
Bitcoin’s volatility is affected by market manipulation.
Bitcoin USD valuation has been volatile but declining for about nine months. That might make it seem to be likely to change course and begin a new trend upwards. When considering the adoption by institutions, it seems like a golden opportunity, doesn’t it? 
Looking at the BTCUSD chart weekly candles, I see decrease in volume, lower highs and approximately the same low range (around $6100). It’s nearly just resting on support and that’s seems like a bad sign. The chart says sell. Am I wrong?
And I still can’t use bitcoin to by anything. It is useless.
If to pay rent, one had to sell either his car or his bitcoin, which would he choose? Which does he need more?
Bitcoin does not seem practical and the chart says sell. So I believe that it is better to sell than to buy bitcoin at this point.
Having said that,I would much rather realize that I am wrong now and alter my position so that I am in a winning trade. I do not want to win on Reddit and lose in the real world. That’s not smart :-)
The best way to teach is to use logic and reason. This will work here because I am not emotionally attached to bitcoin going up or down. Any attempts to convince that a particular viewpoint should be held will fail on me. I do not adhere to being told what to think. So please just present the evidence.

Bitcoin can only be used to exchange value if both parties agree that it holds value. The number of people who believe the bitcoin holds value is a very small minority of the population. It is also population that, for the most part, does not use bitcoin as a medium of exchange and HODLs it.
Bitcoin cannot be used to pay rent or to pay for any consumer staples (food, clothing, etc). It could be, but that is not reality.

“revolutionary” and “for the first time in history“ are insubstantial opinion words. 
 Insubstantial fluff makes Noriel’s arguments weaker, too. When I see arguments that need a lot of adjectives to seem convincing, I take all those adjectives out. 
Also, when I see a position defended with a religious fervor, be bitcoin Maximalism or Noriel’s doom, I take the person less seriously.

About caring about the quality of your posts, you obviously do not. That is shown in that you didn't explain anything logical or rational. Perhaps you can't, so you just rely on your religious belief (like HODL zealots) and, like HODLers, hate the opposing view and anyone who dare consider it. Really stupid.
You claim that you had believed that bitcoin would go up. We have no idea, really. All we know is that it did and now you say you were right. You also try to be as much of an asshole as possible. Doesn't take much skill or brains, so good job on accomplishing nothing useful.
My consideration of whether or not to go long or short on bitcoin is based on which way price is headed. And I don't know where price is headed. So far, going long, I've lost about $40,000. I thought that going long was stupid and I was right but I did it because I thought that there were enough zealots (people like you and my dumb acquaintance who got me into this), that it might drive price up on hopium. Well, I guess I was wrong. I honestly don't know what to do.I'm trying to take a measured, rational approach. 
I've noticed that HODLers are numerous and fervent, which can drive price up. They are also zealous and irrational, which does not bode well for their position. So what the hell do I do —  LONG or SHORT?

The first part of your message is not understandable as English.
It’s not difficult; it’s impossible to purchase anything with bitcoin.
Nothing is priced or sold in bitcoin. Everything in the United states is priced in US dollars. That is the point.

@_date: 2018-10-16 21:10:19
I see no logical coherence in the response nor rationale on why you've chosen long. 
You wrote that it's "stupid" to do otherwise but that's your baseless opinion. Baseless opinions are stupid. It's for HODLers like you, flat earthers, etc. 
You can leave the discussion and stop polluting the thread.

Is the dollar going to collapse? And if it does, will consumer staples be purchased in bitcoin? 
That’s an interesting idea. I don’t think that’s gonna happen soon. I think what is more likely to happen is emerging growth and speculative investments drop. Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies fall into the categories of emerging growth and speculative investment.
@_date: 2018-10-15 07:18:13
It’s awful when you’re short. 
 bitcoin is not an investment. It pays no interest. It has no practical value. It is a popular speculation. I am speculating that other people believe that bitcoin is valuable. And if they do, that they will buy it, driving it’s valuation, measured by the stable dollar, up. I also believe that people become scared of bitcoin dropping., relative to the stable US dollar. Playing off the fear of others has been somewhat profitable at times. But it is difficult for me to understand bitcoin maximalists. Admittedly, I’m not a very good trader

What are the scare quotes for?
This is nothing shocking. 1.5 to 2% inflation rate allows for growth and expansion of the economy. This is basic economic principle and theory. If you don’t like it or don’t agree with it, at least have the diligence to acknowledge it. 
You haven’t given counter argument to why that’s bad. It’s like you’re mocking your “Economics“ And that is stupid.

Prove that The ETH purchased from ROBINHOOD exists. 
It cannot be used for any smart contracts, nor can it be traded for anything else. 
I could only see such exchange being useful if it allowed for speculative investment as futures, leveraged shares(2X, 3X, etc.), and shorting. Does RobinHood offer those features?

Robinhood Does not allow cryptocurrency withdrawls. Does the ETH purchased actually exist? Won’t be able to know one way or another. Won’t be able to use it, either
