Both for different reasons.

do you think Bitcoin will swallow 85% of both gold AND fiat currency?
@_date: 2017-08-02 02:13:36
Oh great! Thanks for the update man. Great work
@_date: 2017-08-13 01:02:45

You'll also see this answer as you look around. "the best time to buy Bitcoin was in 2010. The second best time is now". IF you believe in Bitcoin for the future then don't worry about targeting the best price. Dollar cost average will always win in the end so when you have spare change, convert that bad boy to Bitcoin.

What region is gemini accepted?
@_date: 2017-07-21 01:17:58
Yeah that's fair, and probably the better approach. I'm doing weekly buys regardless of the price myself. I'm also sitting on a small some of cash and trying to decide on buying now or holding out for a drop.

Well, say you spend 30k to get 10 bitcoins because that is the current price. If you instead waited and got in when bitcoin dropped to 2k, you would be able to get 15 coins instead of 10. Sure, present value is only 10k difference but that would equate to 500k to millions difference in future value under your predictions. So yeah, it can make a difference.

oh damn, i didn't even think about that.

yeah push notifications would work. Just something to easily be alerted to.

1. Also maybe an option to send text instead of email?
2. Making this functionality for multiple coins (Litecoin, ETH) via drop down would be great.
3. Maybe if it kicked off an alert 3 times in the same way to highlight the price or emphasize the price in some way. Like if the alert was set to 2% and the last 3 alerts were because it dropped 2% then send a special alert message marked important
Great utility, thanks!

Anyway to tell if these are unique channels or additional channels by current operators?
@_date: 2017-06-30 01:55:50
I like that.

Err, not sure I follow.
The goal is to increase the overall adoption. For that to happen, many improvements will need to happy. One if those is the ease of use.
I am on this sub frequently and have not seen this specific topic come up any time recently so I'm sensing some frustration stemming elsewhere.
Is there something you'd like to talk about?
