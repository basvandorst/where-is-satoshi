This kid is buying $2 of bitcoin every single day for the next year to see how much his portfolio rises. He is predicting that btc will double by July 11, 2020. I think it's kind of a cool experiment.

Well if he can only afford or do $2/day, let him. It only helps us.

Why? This is completely irrelevant if you don’t sell.

If you don't understand that bitcoin is going to at least double within the next year, you shouldn't be invested at all. Pending recession + bitcoin halvening (may) + mass adoption = a new all-time high. If you're complaining about the dip right now, you look beyond ignorant.

Absolute bottom would be 8.5k, so brace for that. Otherwise, just keep buying lol

If you guys don't understand that bitcoin is an incredibly valuable asset that will have mass utility in the (near) future, then you shouldn't be invested. You can't just throw money in something and then assume you're going to get rich immediately. I truly believe that the price will triple between now and next July, but many of you won't wait around long enough to actually make money. Too many shorters.
Countries in trillions of debt (fiat currency) + "pending recession" + bitcoin halvening + move towards electronic currency + limited supply + reliable past
Given all of this\^ do you REALLY believe that somehow bitcoin is going to fail? Just keep buying more while it is this cheap. Plain and simple. I don't understand the weak hands. We are on the verge of something amazing.

Why would anyone be worried right now? This is exactly what’s supposed to happen. Dropping to 9k range and then the bull run we have all been waiting for. Get ready to buy more.
Pending recession + Bitcoin halving + Established Platforms + More knowledge than 2017 this time around
How could anyone argue that bitcoin is going down within the next year?

You guys come on here and freak out about the price every single day��
Put on a reoccurring purchase for $50-$100/month and don't even think about it. You will be able to retire in 15 years. If we all consistently accumulate it, we will moon it like everybody has been talking about.
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:20:56
Then why are you in this discussion?
@_date: 2019-10-17 02:49:03
You’re referring to one year... one year... we are talking about investments here...

It's a privilege to be able to buy this low
