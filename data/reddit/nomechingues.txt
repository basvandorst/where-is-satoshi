yes this do not concern me for myself, im just wondering if other people might be vulnerable do to the fact, that the webpage allocates the name  of the private key to the file to be printed, and I do not know if printers keep some sort of history of printed files.

then the webpage should generate the filename of the public key not the private key, the private key should be invisible to printers and computers as much as possible.
