I have a 35 sat/byte transaction from two weeks ago, do you think it will go through sometime this week?

i have no idea. I just wanted to send 0.06776633 btc from my phone mycellium wallet to my quadrigacx exchange wallet. I have no clue why its so large.

Sometime this week maybe? I need the money kind of urgently :(
I still ended up paying $22 in fees at 35 sat/byte

i get "unable to build transaction" when I click on the bump fee (cpfp) on my mycelium wallet.

so why are these guys able to do higher sat/byte and keep their fees low?

Mycellium has no rbf option.

@_date: 2017-12-25 23:50:05

Im actually really happy that a lot of the bitcoiners here can see through this evil womans bullshit.
@_date: 2017-09-03 00:31:27

@_date: 2018-04-23 20:27:31
