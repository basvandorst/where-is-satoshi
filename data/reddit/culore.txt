Thank you for your reply.  Much appreciated.

What distro would you recommend?
@_date: 2019-03-04 15:29:14
I used a online service to check their BTC addresses are valid or not.

Wow I have to build something just to get a wallet?  
That's why Windows always had a big advantage over Linux.  With Windows it just required two button clicks and a wallet is downloaded and installed.

It's  a AppImage and it ain't opening on Mint.
@_date: 2019-03-04 05:33:43
It simply doesn't install
@_date: 2019-03-04 06:22:19
Electrum isn't compatible with Mint.  I'm on the hunt for a different wallet if anyone has any recommendations.
@_date: 2019-03-04 10:44:05
It's fucking terrible.  After finally getting it to work, it now has invalid BTC addresses.
There are some real shit wallets out there but electrum is easily the shittiest.
@_date: 2019-03-04 05:54:22
Nay, it might work with other Linux versions but not Mint.

From the terminal.....
root sudo apt-get install electrum
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree    
   
Reading state information... Done
E: Unable to locate package electrum
@_date: 2019-03-04 06:41:58
I got it, and still didn't work...
root pip3 --version
pip 9.0.1 from /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages (python 3.6)
@_date: 2019-03-05 04:47:19
Yes.  That is correct.  I don't create the Bitcoin addresses, electrum gives me these Bitcoin addresses....which are invalid.
@_date: 2019-03-04 05:15:26
Unfortunately it doesn't.  I just tried it with pip
@_date: 2019-03-04 15:32:32
Well it fucking didn't.  Electrum has invalid BTC addresses (tested using a online service)
After spending all evening trying to install it, turns out it is useless to begin with.
@_date: 2019-03-04 05:40:56
What is apt-get?
@_date: 2019-02-13 05:36:40
I've just learned that a private key means I can switch it between some wallets.
@_date: 2019-02-14 11:00:03
Requires downloading an app, so not a true web based wallet.

@_date: 2019-02-14 17:18:21
Not on Tails it ain't.  I don't think it's even compatible.
@_date: 2019-02-14 10:19:05
I'm tired of seeing the message; "I'm sorry, somethings gone wrong", almost every time I try to get my receiving address.  It drives me fucking nuts.
@_date: 2019-02-14 10:20:15
I don't own a mobile.
