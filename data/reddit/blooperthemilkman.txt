I don't know specifically about Amazon's tax rate so I can only speculate. I'm all for simplifying taxes though. I can only imagine that Amazon isn't paying taxes due to the massive amount of investment that they undertake each year,  which obviously has many positive impacts on the economy and job market.

Businesses want people to have money because they earned it through work.  For simplicity sake imagine that there is only one business on earth.  People either work for that business or they don't.  What would the motivation be for that business to exchange their goods and services to those that don't work but are instead granted property stolen from the business by the government?  What's the incentive to produce of it's simply to gain back what you've already made?

Look at it for ages 25 through 54 to adjust for an aging population. If there are more octogenarians in a society that are retired or young adults that are still in school then this data set will be skewed lower.

A world like that could have people specializing in certain in-game functions or missions. There would be numerous opportunities to start businesses in a world like that.

I agree completely. It's more efficient to automate a job when possible. But the automation of one job says nothing for the creation of another.

People would start other businesses where they have a competitive advantage to challenge amazon before it ever got to that point.  Look at all of the jobs that amazon has created in other areas that serve it such as shipping and logistics or businesses that can operate better on the amazon marketplace. Economies evolve.  People have been talking about machines replacing all of our jobs for decades.  Yet somehow we're still creating about 180,000 jobs a month in America

Labor productivity is also a function of capital invested, which is why farmers in America utilizing top of the line capital equipment can produce more output than a farmer in rural India using a shovel. With the correct training i thinkthe average Indian could probably operate the equipment available in this country. Which would you rather be?
Labor force participation has actually been increasing recently in America for workers between the ages of 25 and 54, especially for men.  This is a good data set to examine to gauge employment trends since it covers the peak employment years.  That can be checked easily enough on the FRED database. It's not back to its old highs,  but it does indicate that people are willing to re-enter the labor force and that automation has yet to impact the unemployment rate.

In that scenario the state's natural resource is held by the state and the money earned from its use is disseminated to the citizens.  That's not the same as taxing an entity and redistributing the wealth. I think to apply that to UBI would necessitate the state owning the companies and distributing the profit?

Or a debt crisis

It's taxing an entity either directly or through inflationary monetary policy to redistribute wealth.

"In The Fed We Trust".  If you have that much faith in them continue to hold fiat dollars. They sure have done a great job maintaining its purchasing power over the last 40 years. 
Before you do that though you might want to watch Powell's press conference from October 2018 and then his press conference from March 2019. I'm not sure I've ever seen a chairman to have such a poor grasp on the economy. 
I'll stick with Bitcoin.

What successful society hasn't been built through work?  Of course everyone doesn't love their job,  but that doesn't mean they shouldn't have to work.

I understand that you are very passionate about this issue and appreciate that you think it will help people. My worry is that it is not a tested solution. This article was posted in a bitcoin subreddit where users are allocating capital to effectively hedge their purchasing power against irresponsible fiscal and monetary policies that have destroyed the purchasing power of money and distorted the economic signals that, in the past, have allowed for a better allocation of capital and the formation of jobs. It's only natural for me to be skeptical of a program like UBI.

True.  It would be interesting to see if the stock-to-flow ratio holds up with shitcoins over time.  It's great that financial markets can allow us to test these hypothesis. R-squared of 95% for Bitcoin should give HODLers faith and a deviation after the next halving would provide us with a useful signal that our hypothesis may be incorrect.

It looks like it's slightly  below the level reached prior to the great recession but still 1-2% below where it was at the turn of the millenia. As it's still climbing I'm not sure it's fair to say it can't reach those levels though I do admit it is below them.

Greater supply doesn't mean more liquid. Liquidity is impacted by the depth of the market and the difference between the bid-ask spread. Due to the divisibility of btc liquidity shouldn't be a concern, the concern should be which currency offers superior characteristics and will drive increased adoption. That currency will be more liquid.

Yeah, I feel the same way.  It's crazy to me that he can actively participate in debates with individuals that utilize his logic to explain why bitcoin is an attractive investment and then proceed to just dismiss their arguments because gold has had a monopoly on sound money for thousands of years.
