Our future work will include looking at news from wall street journal and Market Watch as well. As for twitter itself, lets take a recent event, the MT Gox liquidation news. News arrives to twitter first, to a mass audience as well, and the audience is crypto specific. We are almost certain that twitter can capture market movements, and at this stage, we still cannot predict as accurately as we hoped for, but we are confident for future works that we will improve. Thanks for your feedback.

You can see this interactive tableau to play with the tool. 
In addition, the price lag everyone is talking about is just adjusting to the actual change in price. Basically, we look at the price yesterday, and I tell you that based on the reach of positive and negative tweets, I expect the price to increase/decrease by a certain amount.

you are right that it seems lagging, but the model actually learns yesterday price and tries to predict the variation of tomorrow's price based on twitter sentiment engagement and reach today, so whenever you see lags it means that it had a bad prediction, and adjusted after learning the real price. Humans lag as well.

sorry my mistake, fitting two images compresses the axis, so start and end dates are no longer synced.
