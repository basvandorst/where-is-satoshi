It's really exciting to think that everyone could be incharge of their own money, while also being a part of what many (including my self) believe to be a new kind of revolution for modern economics.

Remember to think in the long term, belive in the IDEA of crypto and don't try to make profit in the short run, day trading is only good if you know exactly what your doing. HODL!

Fair points, by there's nothing wrong with encouragement in the whole point of bitcoin being a revolutionary technology. I don't see the point in having an issue with people encouraging others to have some faith and look into it themselves rather than going it on their own and giving into emotional speculation. Plus this is great to see what kind of community BTC is going to attract because like it or not, these are the people that influence the mad price swings and the long term value, use this to your advantage of you like or just tone it out and be thankful for being in a more enlightened possition if you believe 'no one knows what they're talking about' because frankly no one does with something as new and exciting as this.

Exactly, it's not for everyone, and there's deffinately no definitive way to win out, it's all about probability and risk reduction

I'd love to see a step by step from the winner, I did most of the translation which was a good challenge. But I'd really like to know how the key it's self was determined. I couldn't figure out the method for that or the number system myself :,)

Oh sweet, yeah that makes sense I guess, it's like using PayPal really? It's not always required for like friends and family, but may be for other transactions. Thanks man

I have to ask as I'm curious, how does this work with the whole idea of bitcoin being an alternative to regular monetary transfers. How is this "cutting out the middle man" when a middle man is often required to ensure the purchase going to be upheld by the person on the other side? I'm not having a crack at the idea, I'm just wondering how it all works towards making bitcoin better than the dollar for example. Sorry if it sounds doubtful, not how it's meant to be.
