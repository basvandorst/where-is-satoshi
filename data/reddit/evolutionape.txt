I actually wasn't familiar with him until I saw this interview. You're right...he seems to be a voice of reason amidst all the noise. Something that Bitcoin/crypto needs more of. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:59:44
Yes...Andreas is hands-down the leading advocate/educator of BTC. We need to see more of him appear in the mainstream market news. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:19:11
I’d have more BTC in my portfolio if I did dollar cost averaging. Instead, I’ve kept giving into thoughts like...”Well...it’s a bit high now. I should wait until it drops a bit before buying.”
The result? 
I put off buying and end up watching the price continue to rise. 
DCA really is the way to go for long-term growth. And the “buy low, sell high” mindset can get in the way of that if one isn’t careful. 
This is a good reminder.

[Abra app]( is pretty simple.

Someone pass this on to [Carlos Matos]( He needs a wife who believes in him. 
@_date: 2017-01-23 14:46:16
Been seeing a lot about Abra lately and am keeping an eye on it. It's an interesting concept. I signed up, but there are no tellers in my area...so I'm curious to see how it develops. 
@_date: 2017-08-27 18:17:19
Just went through all of those for the first time and thought the exact same thing. Very useful for him to explain it to Joe in layman's terms. That's one of Andreas' gifts as a Bitcoin advocate...making it easy to understand for non-developers like myself.

I've been wanting to share this quick story...and this seems like a good time to do so. 
I started exploring local meetup groups for Bitcoin/cryptocurrencies. Went to my first one, which was for the Ethereum group. 
There were some fascinating discussions around what's been happening in the space, how blockchain is being used in new ways and industries, technical perspectives (much of which was over my non-developer head), etc, etc. 
After about 30-45 minutes of this, an older gentleman raised his hand and asked...
"So how do we make money with all of this? What's the magic...What's the magic powder?"
The moderator seemed a bit taken aback but tried to be accommodating in his response. 
A few of the attendees looked at each other with a smirk, and I felt somewhat embarrassed for the guy. 
But it also made me realize that there is a (for lack of a better term) "get rich quick" element that has developed. 
Now...I'm just as interested in the potential to make money as the next guy...but as OP has pointed out, perhaps some people have lost sight of the real value of Bitcoin, blockchain, and cryptocurrencies. 
I, too, was first attracted by the opportunity to have an alternative to the traditional banking systems—having a way to transfer value without a third-party, high fees, and long delays. It seemed like a very liberating concept....money for the people!
I've now become more interested in the underlying technologies and how they're being implemented.
So when I talk to people about Bitcoin, I try to emphasize that...as opposed to any money-making opportunities it might also present. 
@_date: 2017-01-06 00:28:39
This speaks to me on many levels. Thank you for sharing. 
On a related note, a trader friend once told me that when contemplating whether to take some action in a volatile market...one should ask, "Am I acting out of fear...or am I acting out of greed?"
@_date: 2016-11-11 19:13:57
I love this video. I really appreciate how open, respectful, and admiring the Canadian Senate is towards him. 
They realize that this guy truly understands what he's talking about, and they seem genuinely enthusiastic about learning from him. 
That being said, I also get the impression that some of them keep thinking to themselves, "Yes...but how do we regulate/control this?!" 
Andreas' message is basically, "You can't." 
@_date: 2016-12-24 11:56:07
I have no one to share in the excitement with either. So I totally agree. 
@_date: 2016-12-29 11:04:17
I wish I had you to meet for a beer. 
I only have 2 friends I talk to Bitcoin about. One no longer responds to any of my messages related to Bitcoin...and the other thinks Bitcoin will never work because "it's not backed up by anything". 
So I can only rejoice with myself about the current surge in price. 
Cue: "Hello, darkness my old friend..."

Thanks for the info. I'll look into those.

I got a blockchain.info wallet because [Andreas Antonopoulos recommended it]( in this interview a while back. (@ 14:15)
I hear positive and negative opinions on it...so I'm curious to know what has changed. 
I've never had any issues, but I'm also a bit of a newbie and don't fully understand the ins and outs of wallet security, etc. 
@_date: 2017-01-07 12:37:49


Truth. Can't expect to always be right if you're going to play the Bitcoin/investing game.
@_date: 2016-12-28 02:19:28
TL;DR: "I don't know what I'm talking about."

Then at least watch Fire Walk With Me, the film Lynch did that covers the two weeks before Laura Palmer's death. Well worth it, IMO, and might interest you in watching the show. 
I've avoided the latest reboot/remake (or whatever the hell it is). Screw that shit. The show was perfect and should be left alone.

Saw another post on here with the same Monopoly guy chasing the CEO into an elevator. 
Can someone explain how someone dressed like this gets to sit where he's sitting in one of these hearings? How is he able to sit there and troll like that right in front of the camera? 
Genuinely curious.

I hope the memes from that speech never die. Too funny!

You're basically coming in at November prices...so you're picking a great time to enter. Be glad you didn't in December when it was at $20K.

Yes. I'd be happy if I never see that Bitcoin rollercoaster meme ever again. It was funny the first fifty times.

Exactly. When these drops happen...I turn off the charts and go do other things. Best strategy.

Yeah...I just thought the same thing. Don't think I could live myself without giving them back. :/
