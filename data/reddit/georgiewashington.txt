Again, you're comparing apples and oranges.
40 years ago, an average single income family had one car, a 1600 square foot house, their kids didn't go to college, and cities like Akron, Flint, &amp; Dayton were where most people lived. Families rarely ate out, only the rich had cablevision, and obviously there was no internet. Weekly activities included Dad's bowling league, Mom's book club, church twice a week, the kids played on the public high school sports teams, and the family took 1 vacation a year to go sit on the beach or camp in the woods.
It's still easy to live that life in those places on a single income, but people don't want that. They want 2-3 cars, they want 2600 square foot houses, they want to eat out every lunch and dinner, they want to send their kids to 4 year universities, they want to live in bigger cities than Akron or Flint, they want to take 3 or 4 vacations a year to Disneyland and the like, they want everyone to have a higher-end cell phone, cable TV, &amp; Internet, and they want to hire someone to do all their housework, home repairs, and car repairs.
It's okay to want those things and have those things, but it's a more expensive lifestyle than what most people had 40 years ago. The expected middle-class lifestyle of today is essentially how the wealthy lived 40 years ago.
If you still want a modest house in Akron, with one family car, eat dinner at home every meal except special occasions, no cable, modest internet, good-enough cell phones, maybe send 1 child to community college, go to church on Sundays &amp; Wednesdays, Dad with his weekly bowling league and Mom with her weekly bible study or whatever, that's fairly doable on 1 income. But nobody wants that anymore.

40 years ago most people didn't eat McDonald's. They ate at home or packed a lunch for almost every meal. 
Adjusting for inflation, decent homes can still be had for that cheap. The average home size in 1970 was 1600 square feet. Today it's 2600 square feet. 
A nice 1600 square foot home in a medium size city still averages less than $100,000.

I think It's overdue for a dip. 
That said, what would you regret more, buying and then it dipping, or it not dipping and growing another 4000?

I think you've never sat down and put pencil to paper on this. I challenge you to do so. Also, I think you're missing quite a bit of the nuance of what I'm saying. I'm only speaking within the context of living a comparable life to someone from 40 years ago, I'm not saying that that is what most people are doing though.
See below:
Without a college degree, a person in the US will end up averaging about $40,000/year throughout their life.
Using the criteria of the 60s and 70s, that's enough for a family of 4 to live off of. Considering all of the following:
1) one family sedan that only gets replaced maybe once every 7 years or so(and maybe by the 3rd one, the family keeps the old one as a second car. Maybe). 
2) 1600 square foot home(the average size in 1970). (In Akron, Ohio for example, that's currently a $65-$70,000 home)
3) no cable, modest internet(or no internet), and modest cell phones.
4) One spouse stays home all day doing the cooking and cleaning, one or both spouses do all or most of the home repairs themselves, the family eats out once a month, and only takes one vacation a year -- in the summertime to go camping, a national park, or the beach.
5) Weekly activities consist of Dad in a bowling/softball league, mom in a book club/PTA/Bible Study group, family goes to church once or twice a week, the kids do public school sports, maybe boy/girl scouts, and the family maybe goes to someone else's house once a week for dinner/drinks. 
This is the typical life of a middle class, one income family in the 60s and 70s. This seems like a no-frills lifestyle to people today, because there are so many more things to do and places to go. But one doesn't have to do other things to be middle class. 
Living the life of an average American family from 40 years ago is still easy on 1 income, even without a degree. But nobody wants to live that life anymore.

You aren't comparing apples to apples. It's still pretty easy to afford the lifestyle of the people that lived on one income 30/40 years ago. The lifestyle most people live today was never affordable by most people on one income 30/40 years ago.

At the risk of dying the death of 1,000 downvotes, I don't think Hodlers of bitcoin will behave any differently than rational actors in any other market.
I think the vast majority of Hodlers have their Moon. When they hit it, they'll sell. I get that a lot of the hardcore Hodlers are going to Hodl indefinitely, but I doubt the vast majority will. 
Hodlers Hodling is not enough to keep the market from crashing on it's own, which I think he is implying. The product has to get used in some capacity. Fortunately, it is currently. 
Where Hodlers *can* make a difference though, is by maintaining the value long enough the public at large to finally shift their perspective and see BTC as having the same promised value as the dollar or gold. Hopefully that mental switch gets flipped in most people before the Hodlers hit their Moon.

I'm glad at least you and I are on the same page.

So in this scenario, let's say address A now has 2 UTXOs of .5BTC each, totaling 1BTC. If A sends a single transaction to Address D for 1BTC, does D now have 2 UTXOs of .5BTC each because that's what A had before sending, or does D now have 1 UTXO totalling 1BTC because that's what D received?

Can you explain a little further?
Forgive my ignorance, but my understanding is that one of the constraints Bitcoin is beginning to face, is that data can only be written on to ledgers at a certain speed, and as the data needed to record transactions grows, it's taking longer and longer to record each transaction. Segwit2X is supposedly meant to increase the speed at which transactions can be recorded, so that transactions can now happen much faster. But to do so, whomever the creators of that code are have written the code in such a way that they will control the ledgers. Sort of a classic sacrificing security for convenience. 
Is that correct?

Good luck finding 67 senators, 290 representatives, and 38 state legislatures to agree with you.

But it's not written into the Constitution.

This is great and all, but I won't be happy until they go to 9 conference games and do away with divisions. 
Play five permanent rivals, then 4 on/4 off for the remaining 8 teams in the conference. The top two teams every year play in Atlanta for the championship. This way the best possible matchup plays in Atlanta and every athlete plays every other team at least twice in his career.

And would I need to hold them somewhere besides gdax?
