Dollar cost averaging is a good method opposed to trying  to time the markets, although it really depends what your comfortable with

They are having issues right now, mine took about 2 hrs but it did go through don’t worry
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:13:32
Right but you have to have the stars align. There is a premium and discount for buying the contract. Now you need bitcoin to somehow hit your exact spot price on the day of expiration, to avoid cancelling the contract, less any trading fees or premiums. If bitcoin hit 20k on a futures with a spot of 20k. Yes, you would have made nothing, except the premium for selling the futures. There is no 1200 gap.

We should time our buys and sells because every time I sell the price skyrockets

What? If you knew the price of bitcoin was going to hit the future price then you would just buy the fuckin coin. A future is a bet, one that is also settled in cash. The 1200 over spot price is meaningless, because the contracts are bought and sold prior to expiration anyway. Since you are not selling or buying 1 btc for 1200 over spot, and only settling in cash, that contract becomes more valuable the closer bitcoin gets to it. In a normal futures if bitcoin went 1500 over the futures you would buy then sell immediately for a 300$ profit. Now of course this assumes the price is going up. If bitcoin was at the futures price at the time of expiration it’s a wash. If it was less, well now you are offering to buy and sell bitcoin for more than it’s work (technically in a real futures for simplicity sake). What your saying makes no sense unless you assume bitcoin is going to be well over the spot price prior to expiration, but at that point why would you own the asset and the derivative? Your doubling down your bet, exactly the opposite of you initial strategy and  the reason you bought the futures and not the coin.

You want someone to donate a cool 1.9 mil on the assumption your going to use it to do good. Wtf lol get this shit outta here

Something similar happened to my friend, coinbase will simply request the money back(if the transfer even goes through), and should you refuse they will just issue a court summons and get the money anyway. They know you have it and there is no way your going to get to claim it 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:42:16
I have 5 confirmations and still pending to coinbase. I guess I’ll take my seat

@_date: 2017-12-13 15:42:39
So this all seems rather....reasonable. I think it brings more legitimacy to the exchanges so people don’t feel like they are trading on a platform held together wi h bubble gum and broken dreams.

Interesting you say that. Let’s say you invest 100$ per week and each week the price of bitcoin is 100$ 90$ and 200$ respectively. Now your overall cost is 300$ of course. If you invested the lump sum of 300$ at week 1 you would have 3 bitcoin. Week 2 you have 3.3.  Week 3 you would have 1.5. If you dollar cost averaged your buys you would have 2.6. Which method sounds like timing the markets? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:05:09
Your not taking into account the premium / discount tied to the contract. Also if bitcoin was 18800 and the spot price on the contract was 1200 over so let’s say a hit of 20k. You owe 20k, and by selling the bitcoin you just immediately lost 1200 not gained it. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:39:43
So accurate it hurts. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:47:28
But.... their in lies the problem. Cryptos are unpredictable. Sure if you knew it was goin to rise then yeah invest everything. Fucking sell your house and everything you own. But within 25 min I just watched bitcoin jump up and down 200$. I mean everyone has their own investment strategy and yeah, invest in the lump sum at the low point will yield more, but hindsight is 20/20 and the low is only revealed after the fact. Just my 2 cents. I mean neither of us is wrong it’s just a matter of perspective.

I’ve noticed this pattern too, but it’s hard to time when bitcoin is beginning its blood sucking pump

No, greens are buys and reds are sells. The bars turn that color based on the net buy/sell period. Example: if there are more buys than sells in a specific 5 minute window that candle will turn green.

@_date: 2017-12-12 03:10:47
Sorry if I keep repeating myself (do you have a video) but I must be confused on how your actualy executing the trade logistically. 
So let’s say btc at the time of the contract was 10k with a 1200$ premium so a target price of 11200.  You buy the futures contract AND 1 btc wit the expectation of selling at 11200 so your cost is 0 and you net the 1200 right?  
What if btc falls to 9000k at the time of expiration. The trade is settled in cash, with the expectation that you are paying the third party with 11200$ worth of bitcoin( so just cash). The contract does NOT settle at the 9000k with you netting the 1200k difference if you sold your btc. When you buy the contract you owe that sum at the time of expiration, it does not lock in the price of anything, and is meaningless to the btc that you purchased along side it. So using the above example at the time of expiration you have 1btc worth 9000k and a futures contract expected to settle at 11200&amp; you lost 2200$. Well 3200 if you lock the loss from btc as well. I might have to watch a video explaining more about btc future since they work a bit different but this is how I think about it. Let me know if this is ass backwards lol

Angel memorial animal hospital in Boston, Ma. I don’t know if they take bitcoin or how this would but I’d love to work something out with you if possible. They saved my dogs life, twice; and I always try to donate a little bit every year but this would be super cool if we could make it happen.
