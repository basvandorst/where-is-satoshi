When you said 20k I  wasn't sure if you were talking about $ or upvotes.
An early indicator, perhaps

People ITT saying "majority of users have $X in their account" is kind of silly, it's like saying "let's focus on the median account value rather than the average."
Don't forget how many custodial accounts  Coinbase  is running, and how that # probably decimates what reddit invests collectively.

Your argument falls apart here, by your logic why would we report Roger Ver's bitcoin over reporting bitcoin.org? Or ethereum? Or the USD? Kind of with u/hackerbeedrone here - it's an open source community issue

You might be right; his intentions are quite unclear and perhaps the only thing that is clear is that he wants BCH to outgrow BTC. Philosophy aside I agree with you, but I think his argument for upholding the whitepaper's ideals is actually pretty sound. 
A lot of people don't even understand that the few people holding keys to the github repository are controlling what bitcoin is, and that's what is borderline fraudulent to me. Bitcoin in its most original form was guided by an algorithm, not a group of people who got to fork and upgrade a code repo as they please. It was never supposed to encourage a miner monopoly. 
If I was new to bitcoin, I'd want to know that too. If anything I'd prefer he used a name like Bitcoin Classic, sticking with the ideals just like ETC chose to do. Then again, that name probably got shut down real fast when they were thinking of a good ticker symbol. 
In all reality, I think BCH is a lot more legitimate than people tend to give it credit for, but I think Ver trying to force this label is still quite unethical, regardless of his beliefs.

Not in Bitcoin, but a lot of alts would see significant movement from $250,000. I bet even a project around $100mm market cap would get a 5% swing if not more from such an amount. If used at the right time, it could cause waves which inspire more buying activity. But yeah with Bitcoin, maybe $5-10 movement or so but not much more than that.

So if a person sends money from address A to address B, where said person owns A &amp; B, that counts as a transaction?

You know CSW is a fraud when [Vitalik calls him out on it in the middle of his own conference]( - pretty convicting considering Vb felt the need to publicly crucify him - good clip if anyone somehow didn't see that yet.

Is the tier monthly, yearly, or lifetime?

I think there's also some massive confusion about where people keep their funds. For most cryptocurrency, especially things like ERC-20 tokens, a significant amount of cryptocurrency is stored on law-compliant exchanges. Many of the coins I've seen are at least 30-50% stored on exchanges, for Bitcoin it's probably a little bit less, but arguably above 20% which is still millions of bitcoin.

For buying anything under $1000, Bitcoin isn't much better to be honest. Lightning network may help a bit but there's a lot of logistics issues here.

This all relies on your assumption that the price in May was worth what it should've been. Take that assumption out and realize that value is seen for what it is, nothing more, nothing less.

People are pretty greedy, though. Satoshi knew this. I do agree that you're right, it's just about timing. Speculation will not always be what it is when people take off rose colored shades, and if too many people remove them at once it might end up as shell shock.

Yep. To move money quickly, you could wire to Gemini (since they won't let you move ACH until it clears, usually like a day?), then buy ETH and transfer to GDAX (~5-10 min) then do what you will.

I'm not against BTC but I think there is some over the top maximalism prevalent in this title, are you effectively saying that all non-Bitcoin investments exist in a closed system? Disregarding all non-bitcoin cryptos is one thing, but denying the existence of profit-driven businesses that provide critical services minute after minute, that's something else...
