An actual warrant from a normal court? That's fine. I can accept that because that's part of a normal criminal investigation.  
The issue is when they're sent a [REDACTED] from a [REDACTED] and I'm none the wiser.

That's not how things work with a legit court, or at least if that is how it's working it's in the open. There are "courts" though that don't have to play by those rules or indeed any rule.

as we all know, the clean energy industry has a lot of demand for petrochemical engineers.

Unless you're referring to the carbon dioxide we exhale, I find it highly unlikely that it's impossible for technology to advance to the point where humanity is producing little to no excess carbon dioxide.

Define "most". I don't know when you've last been to China, but while it isn't exactly a utopia the middle class is leaps and bounds ahead of where they were a decade or a decade and a half ago. 
Yeah, sure, they aren't all living at American standards but for them to do that their economy would be the largest in the world by an enormous margin.

...so you're saying the Chinese markets haven't (in real terms) significantly appreciated in... the past *decade*?  
Have you seen the difference between China ten years ago, and China now?
@_date: 2015-08-24 16:43:13
Of course, the Chinese market is massively overvalued. I just don't think it's overvalued by like, 200%.

There's a difference between "A lot of air" and "75%".  
If the markets of any major economy, be it China, the US or the Eurozone tanked 75% I'd pack my shit and make for the hills.

Because everyone already involved in this considers his or her proposal to be reasonable, and yet we have no consensus.

I have been told I have lovely eyes.

I was more making a cheap joke about the old 'this is good for bitcoin' line.

And here I thought GTA was totally unrealistic in that regard.
Five stars, straight up.

Remove the np. from the URL. It was a rule when cross-referencing subreddits back when reddit didn't default to https and browsers were less strict. Now those things changed and going there makes your browser chuck a hissy fit.

So.... not matter what's happening...
It's... good for bitcoin?

Uh... that's not how WWII was funded, they mostly just took on loans from the populace (the US government, anyway).
Things aren't always done for profit, anyway. Gotta get those sick returns from invading Poland, dontcha know.
