Soo it was another flight then. Not actually more expensive than the listed flight?

Oh my. Why is he a depressing man? And how did he fail to explain bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-11-14 14:30:36
Im from Sweden and what do you mean?
@_date: 2013-11-30 21:06:04
Can someone please explain to me what this means. I will be grateful, honestly. What did I do, something with the email?
@_date: 2013-11-14 14:24:53
He was correct in everything he said. It is at least designed so that you can chose to be anonymous to a certain degree if you want to. I mean that is not an outreagous thing to say about bitcoin I believe? The comment about the system never being able to get as big as e-mail because of the 21m btc cap I agree that was unfounded, but at the same time its not like he is lying about it, he just fails to mention that you can divide a btc infinately.
And saying someone is a depressing man because you think he looks depressing...Come on, you're better than that.
Edit: Your/You're. I caught myself.

Can confirm. Online poker used to be huge in the US, now you cant play from there at all. A lot of the pros moved to Mexico and Canada. Its still huge everywhere else though.

This doesnt seem good, if its indeed a scam. Buyers beware. I wanted to order a PS4 from them but cant seem to bring myself to do it, doesnt look serious.
@_date: 2013-11-30 13:58:53
I was very close to ordering a PS4 but got discouraged after I didnt see one other person mentioning ordering from them. I even got email respons from them not more than 5 hours ago trying to lure me in: 
"Yes we have PS4 available and we offer free shipping to US, UK and EU for orders by Monday Dec 2nd 00.00 .The consoles are available to be shipped right away upon payment confirmation from our merchant.
Thank you,

Very good and objective. He was well informed and didnt put any personal judgment into it. Only the quote "Can never grow that large because of the 21m coin cap" that was a little off base imo.

The interview is short and in the biggest and broadest morning show in the country wich caters to the average joe. This is the morning news, not Tech Daily. So the first 3 quotes I actually liked that he simplifies a little. 
"Internet money that you can print with a computer that the government has no control over". - Sounds about right to me, no?
After the question about some people saying its a ponzi and used to buying drugs he is saying "yes it is" to the buying drugs part, the affirmative is not at all intended to adress the ponzi scheme accusation:
"Yes, the system is constructed so that all transactions are secret, so that  NSA etc cant read your e-mail(?) and see that you have bought so and so from a certain place. Everything is encrypted carefully"
He adds that neither in USA nor Sweden are these things illegal. "If you  have a company and take payment in BTC then you have to declare it in your book keeping the same way you would have to do with any other currency"
He also mentions silk road, that the price is set w supply/demand as usual and is worth what someone is willing to pay for it. He also says that  "quite a lot" of peple are starting to accept bitcoin as payment. And on the question if you can buy a washing machine with btc he answers "I dont think so but thats probably just a matter of time" 
So he mentions cryptography, he says the government has no control over it and he says you can use it in a lot of places and probably soon will be able to buy stuff like waching machines too. Thats pretty positive mentions no?

Please return with what you find. I was considering ordering something also to see if its a scam or not.
@_date: 2013-11-30 13:53:52
Ok. The sites is down. "Has been suspended"
@_date: 2013-11-14 14:28:25
So you think all media outlets should be privately owned?
@_date: 2013-12-05 00:22:32
The site is down since yesterday. And I cant find their twitter account anymore. So I guess we were right. Sorry to the people that lost money.

Im trying to share this on Facebook but just get the same error message over and over: "The message could not be posted to this Wall"
Whats the problem? I really want to share this!
@_date: 2013-11-14 12:23:43
I dont agree at all. Yes it was a short interview covering the basics. But everything he said was correct and objective. Only that one line where he says it cant grow "that big" (like e-mail) because of the 12m coin cap. Besides that he was 100% correct and objective.

We have the best government TV in the world, im pretty sure. Of course its not near perfect at all times, but seriously is that really the expectation? Compared to the rest of the world we have great government TV in Sweden, some of you people from other countries would probably be surprised what some of the swedes call "bad".

Im sorry dude. I think everyone learned a pretty good lesson here. We are just lucky more people didnt get burned. I almost got in on this deal too, if their website had been a little bit more professional I would have put in an order for sure. Maybe we should have a subforum discussing merchants so that you can check for comments before ordering something from a company. I mean this will surely not be the last time we see theese kinds of scams.
