So OP are you ever going to invest using bitcoins instead of just holding them? You would've gained so much money if you just held your btc instead.
@_date: 2014-07-31 01:33:36
I'm glad people like you exist, speculating on reddit about the future where all of your problems are solved by other people hard work, instead of you actually working towards it.

A lot of small towns that are receiving remittances don't even have computers let alone internet access to receive bitcoins. 
And what are they supposed to with them even if they get them? It would be extremely difficult to convert them to the local currency, I doubt there are businesses that are willing to take them, or anybody to buy them from them. 
@_date: 2014-07-08 19:35:17
Well the thing is you're making the claim that the US dollar is going to collapse with no proof, other than "just read something man".
I don't need to "wake up" and read "something", you need to stop reading sensationalist literature that somehow convinced you that the US is about to fall apart.

So nobody can go into debt in this future bitcoin world? How do you buy a home? How do businesses invest into new capital? 
You can't make more bitcoin, but why can't you just make a new altcoin and pay people with that?
@_date: 2014-08-01 09:22:07


This already exists, bitcoin doesn't add anything here.


Fraud will exist if bitcoin becomes popular. Thinking that it will get rid of it is just delusional.
Unstable countries? I think bitcoins volatile nature is more of a problem.

The fed adjusts the money supply in few different ways. First you have to understand what fractional reserve banking is and its effects on the economy, or you probably wont understand what the Fed does. Also you have to understand what changing the money supply does to an economy.
1. It performs open market operations, buying US treasury bonds decreases the money supply, selling them increases the money supply.
2. The fed sets the reserve requirement for banks, it can raise it or lower it.
3. The fed can pay banks interest on their reserves, encouraging them to hold more.
4. The fed also sets the discount rate, which is used when banks lend to other banks.

One of the bigger problems with bitcoin is that it's deflationary. That may not be a negative for a lot of bitcoiners, but it is to anybody who has taken intro to econ in high school or college.
@_date: 2014-08-03 18:53:51
Not easy to manipulate? Are you kidding? The all time high was because of mtgox fake trades, which then of course crashed when mtgox went under.

Sorry, anarchy is not appealing, call me a statist, but I don't believe people will ever be able to become perfect, and act in a completely reasonable manner, and I don't think removing the state is a way to fix that.
@_date: 2014-07-22 18:37:09


 Anarchism is one of political ideologies that require an utopia to function. Crackpot political theories like it are only popular on the internet.
@_date: 2014-07-28 01:54:43


Yes you can, they're called credit cards. Just because you don't want to doesn't mean that you can't.


Bitcoins are a currency, like the USD or the Euro. It has some extra features that are appealing to some people, but otherwise it's not that different.
@_date: 2014-08-05 05:11:48
You want banks to accept bitcoin for mortgages? Thats hilarious
@_date: 2014-07-22 05:56:57
Of course Chase can shut down a bank account that somebody has opened at their bank, why wouldn't they be able to?
The only way for them not to have that ability is because of government regulation, something which I'm sure a large majority of this sub is against, considering all the anti-NY regulation posts.

How do you use bitcoin if you don't own a computer? I suppose you'd need a third party to receive it for you, but that would defeat the entire purpose of bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-07-22 02:55:59
You preached being extremely cautious with your money in this post. Having any money in bitcoin is the opposite of being cautious with your money, making assumptions had nothing to do with my reply.

You probably lost them at all at this point, they probably think of know as the crazy anarchist guy now.

Well in the case of my mom, aunts and uncles who send remittances to a small town (~1500 pop) in Mexico, they send it to a nearby town that does have a bank, so they are a part of this discussion.

I'm not a troll, I just like to browse r/bitcoin because its the perfect combination of delusional "investors", austrian/chicago "economists", nutty libertarians, with an added bonus of anarchists. Oh and amateur programmers now apparently, but I guess I should've known due to the awfulness that is Satoshis programming.


You know that schools, colleges, universities exist right? Of course I assumed correctly that you weren't employed at any of those, professors tend to be at least competent.


Sorry, I forgot to mention shady businessmen like Karpeles.
@_date: 2014-07-22 08:00:57


Meh, limited money supply is a very libertarian/austrian idea, it goes against established/mainstream economics. It's not hard to see why nutty libertarians flocked to bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-08-04 00:17:56
Well its true that a lot of bitcoin is hype coming from those who've invested, but it still has useful features. Point them out, but don't talk about how bitcoin is going to topple the government/banks, they'll just think you're crazy.
@_date: 2014-07-06 04:48:01
As opposed to the widely known idea that deflationary currencies are inferior?
And isn't doge just a carbon copy of bitcoin other than the limitless coins? If one is bad then the other is as well.

Didn't Nakamoto design bitcoin with a limited amount in order to produce deflation when all bitcoins were mined? Wasn't he also an Austrian economist, who reject all the ideas behind inflation and its benefits?

So aggressive, I doubt you're anything more than a kid making crappy online tutorials.


Yea and you're making the extraordinary claim the bitcoin will ever be anything more than a niche for nerdy programmers or opportunistic day traders.

Bitcoin aren't a replacement or even an alternative to CC's, I don't understand why this is so hard to understand. With CC's, you can buy things without actually having the money (using credit), you can't do that with btc.

Some people don't want to deal with the hassle of converting bitcoins into USD.

Basically according to self-educated austrian economists hyper-inflation is always right around the corner, and you need to prepare by buying gold, silver, or more recently, bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-07-30 06:48:33
Its a good thing everyone stuffs USD in their mattress for 100 years instead of using it to invest.
@_date: 2014-07-06 18:55:32
Yea and bitcoin is useful until your account gets hacked and your coins stolen, it has happened to plenty of people.
See how what you said makes no sense?
@_date: 2014-07-16 23:33:48
You still haven't shown how someone can use bitcoin without owning a computer. How are you going to receive them? 
I'm not saying it isn't possible, I'm trying to say that its unlikely to happen anytime soon without the infrastructure being put into place.

Because OP has money in btc, not litecoin, duh.
@_date: 2014-07-07 20:37:04
I think he hates bitcoin because its creator and a large amount of its users disagree with established mainstream economics, and it also did lose a lot of people a ton of money when it crashed a few months ago.

Alright everyone that hold bachelors, masters and phds in economics from literally every reputable university in the US, its over, xbtdev says that you don't have any credibility, time to throw that degree that took years acquire into the trashcan.
So why the distrust in established economics? Is buying a book on Amazon or reading some articles online about Austrian "economics" better than going to an actual university?

Bitcoin cannot replace credit cards, or even compete against them. Credit cards give you the ability to buy things even if you don't have the money, what's known as credit. 
With bitcoin, you have to own enough bitcoin to buy whatever you want to buy. 
Also, what if businesses don't care about bitcoin adoption? What do they stand to gain from bitcoin becoming popular?
Not every business is like Overstock who actually care about it all, I'm sure a lot of businesses are just using it as cheap advertising.
@_date: 2014-07-31 16:57:38


You do realize that the all time high bitcoin price was manipulated by fake mtgox transactions right?

Well that is common advice for gambling, which is basically what buying crytocurrencies like bitcoin is. Obviously you have to invest in something, but making safe investments is smarter than gambling in bitcoin.


So you got lucky? There are probably more people that bought in at $300+ with all the hype than those who bought in at $10.

I think the best option if you care about Gaza, is to wait until bitcoin increases in value to the point where owning a single bitcoin will be enough to hire mercenaries or a PMC.

This entire thread is about remittances, I'm saying that bitcoin is unlikely to be used for that purpose any time soon. It will take multiple years for some places to even have internet access. 
You reply doesn't even make sense, just stop posting.
@_date: 2014-07-21 00:49:05
You're basically saying that people should just hold their bitcoins instead of spending them, because they're going to skyrocket in value.
Which is actually one of the arguments against having a deflationary currency like bitcoin, it'll lead to stagnant economy since nobody will invest and just hide their money under their mattress, or whatever the bitcoin equivalent is.
@_date: 2014-07-08 06:22:45

Whats with the obsession over "intrinsic value" here? Does it really matter that our currencies don't have any? 
Also, isn't it better to not tie our potential economic growth to a certain amount of a resource, say gold, instead being able to increase the money supply to stimulate it like the fed does with fiat?

So because a portion of USD only exists on computers, (which is something that anyone with a high school education should know) you buy bitcoins that ONLY exist on computers?
