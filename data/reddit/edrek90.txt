I think people switched to LTC and ETH, because of the fees.

How do you know there is no new money coming in?
@_date: 2018-09-19 22:00:18
lol, over 10 years
Do you know how old bitcoin is?

This is what makes me pessimistic...This bull run showed that BTC was not mature  and it made a lot of bad news. So now to make this bad impression go away we will need a lot of good news and people willing to again support BTC. But I'm not sure people will want to come back to BTC after all this.

Not really, why do you need a stock? Can you use it for something other, than gaining wealth?
Bitcoin is decentralised so it can be used at any moment, something other currencies can not. That is what the OP is alluding to.

What people seems to forget is that this wil create more awareness...That is more important than the fact that you can or cannot use BTC in a coffeeshop! 
Also conversation from fiat to BTC and vice  versa is the intermediary step to only using BTC.

Not really, if my calculations are correct Bitcoin will become a stable coin.
@_date: 2018-08-03 18:18:57
Wrong. It wil create awareness, thus possibly some people wil buy Bitcoin.

OP is probably Canadian

I love how you said a lot without saying anything

Perfect timing! Consensus starts tomorrow...

Couldn't one day Bolivar be worth much more? I mean it won't be forever like this...I would prefer to keep my 'money' to be sure.

I would probably start an organisation that would help the less fortunated. Probably something with schooling. I would still live like a wealthy person. 
Like being the second Bill Gates.

If Bitcoin had as much liquidity as the Dow, we wouldn't see such a bear market in Bitcoin. Lots of liquidity makes it much more difficult to move the market.
Eg: The 2008 recession for example was so strong, because of a lack of liquidity in the stock market.

It really baffles me, that people are buying stocks/cryptocoins without understanding the basics of how a stock market is suppose to work. 
@_date: 2018-10-01 22:13:11
Prove it!

We are talking about holding vs day trading, right???
So person A made a loss, because he will have to rebuy at a lower price. Thus making a loss (day trading!). Same with person B and so on. 
Let say there is an extra person D, who bought a the same price as A but doens't sell (holding). He will gain more money than all the others.
@_date: 2017-08-09 22:47:21
For every person that makes a profit, there as to be a person that makes a loss.

If you use Euro, you can try Blockport. Very easy to use.

Where can I invest in inflation?
@_date: 2017-08-10 00:04:27
It is if you are day trading! But if you hold for a long period more people get in to buy, thus the price rises (scarcity). 
Edit (more info): mapRP was talking about a closed group of people!

Neo is the answer. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 23:21:45
You can't buy, if nobody is selling!

I thought we were already in the despair phase, but apparently we are still in the delusion phase...

I love post that use just facts!

If you want to value something, you need something else of value as a reference. USD is the most popular currency, so it's logic to use it as a reference.

Volume is incredibly low now

The only way to know if you can trust something is by inspecting it yourself, if you don't want to do that then nothing will ever be completely trustless for you.

Smart move, so you have more time to buy cheap bitcoin
