I think we could debate for a very long time on general pain and how it affects mental health. I would almost argue depression is a mental manifestation of "pain".
Naxolone is an opioid antagonist, it's used mainly to counteract opioid overdose. Maybe a longitudinal study for reducing susceptibility of the experience of pain but as I understand it, that is has not been successful.
Cartenfinil is one of the strongest opioid drugs known to man. Opioid drugs operate by making you feel good. If someone literally got half their body blown off that drug would "demonstrate significant improvement in symptoms". How can you not get this bit? Just because a super potent feel good drug can temporarily make you feel good does not mean it's acceptable to use in a clinical setting.
And yes obviously viagra has some mild effects on PH (it was designed for it), but it's not really used for that because there are many better drugs. Those drugs don't change how horny you feel, just blood flow.
Your argument is basically if an opioid temporarily eases symptons it should have a clinical use. Heroin does this. Do I really need you to explain to me why it's a bad idea to treat psychiatric patients with heroin? An opioid is an opiate is an opioid is an opioid. They all have the same mechanism of action and effects.

They're making dollars by skimming the cream off the top. To them, they don't care about the price of BTC because they will always get their $ % value of every single transaction.
They would literally let people buy goods for feces if it meant they got a % profit from every purchase. That's the economist talking.

Downvoting people because you saw in the stars that BTC will go over $1,000 again. Shorting is profiting from the downwards direction of the price; holding with intent of appreciation is the exact opposite.
It was so brief that it go over $1,000 and the circumstances behind the bubble are rife with speculation, manipulation and fraud. Never mind the fact that we're currently in an 11 month downtrend at this stage.

They are accepting through BitPay. Until they actually say they are accepting bitcoins I would reserve my judgement. Until then it's probably fair to say, like 99% of all BitPay clients that they are accepting USD.

BTC isn't really a good way of managing financial risk. Professionals who have deep fiat pockets would likely be turned away from crypto by their own analysts/advisers based on the own risk assessments. They try to manage risk, or reduce it as far as reasonably practicable whereas BTC, at least right now, only adds risk through massive swings in spot price.

This is simply wrong in every aspect. The spread on these is huge and renders them essentially useless. Please show me a use where buying BTC for 10%+ over spot price is a good thing to do.
The reason is for them to make their money, that's obvious. Given the relatively small volume with these machines, even with the absolutely massive fees, they are unlikely to even pay for themselves. The first mover advantage doesn't apply if there is nobody moving into the space after you with an unprofitable business plan.

We are agreeing on that bit. If the fees are high it's one of two things, they're actually getting enough users to sustain themselves (very unlikely) or there are so few people currently using it that they have no competition (likely) and can run out the last of the VC funding until they go bankrupt.
They currently only exist because they're backed by people with money taking a gamble by investing in them. They are not profitable.

The utility is being able to use it on the internet like any other sort of money though, and even in that respect it's lacking.
No qualms about people speculating with it, it's their money and I've done it myself many times, but BTC is literally backed by nothing other than data centres and fiat going into exchanges.

This really has nothing to do with "Wall Street". It says there have been investments in BTC (not sure exactly what this means in the context) and that exchanges are now offering more complex trading platforms to deal with low liquidity.
The Wall Street traders already have access to these instruments and can make just as much using them with virtually any commodity. The BTC volatility isn't really that much of a sell for traders any more since you can used leveraged trading to get about the same profits with much less volatility.
I really don't think these large trading firms are that interested in it given you can only trade or use these platforms by entrusting unregulated entities with your wealth. Not worth it

Almost like if you could categorise persistent mental discomfort as a learned cognitive process, as if depression was essentially an acquired form of pain. How we view pain has changed so drastically over the last 10 years it's hard to really quantify what I'm suggesting but the 5-HT route is a complete failure.
Like if you hurt you leg and you feel pain, your leg doesn't actually feel anything. Your brain is what's telling you it hurts. It's kind of hard to put into words but the only way I can meaningfully explain depression is persistent mental pain. There are correlations to be made with neurochemicals being "lower" than "baseline" but I think that's more of a consequence of depression rather than the cause of it. Probably why Big Pharma piss away all their research funds of making "new" SSRIs. Ketamine is provably better than SSRIs/SNRIs/DRIs/NRIs; basically everything in those neurochemical systems.

I don't know what to say really. I think the BTC mining schedule and the outrageous hashrate increases are bad for BTC as a whole, I'm just not exactly sure how it will effect the spot price. Maybe not at all, but in my opinion it will over time. To the network I suppose it doesn't really matter.
@_date: 2014-09-23 12:34:43
Maybe I'm grossly under qualified to answer this, but lack of faith in the rise of BTC's spot price is *precisely* the reason to short it.
Just say they borrow 100 BTC to instantly sell at $600 and wait it out. They notice the price is still declining daily and can continually keep borrowing BTC to sell. Fast forward to now, they can buy all the BTC back that they initially borrowed plus interest. Broker profits, trader profits.

I noticed before people buying BTC on site upwards of $700 when they cost maybe $550. If you sell your BTC for way above market price you will likely be caught out and can face real fraud charges in real life. If you pay close to market price I think you will be in the clear even if the money comes to you from fraudulent cards.
It makes absolutely no difference to the theif whether they pay 800, or even 1000 per bitcoin because it's essentially free for them anyway.

It's nothing other than a promise that if the bitcoin network is still processing transactions and people are still accepting cryptocurrency as a form of exchange then it is almost by definition a promissory note. A type of paper currency that if damaged/destroyed is lost inside a ledger never to be recovered.
This is besides the fact that actually purchasing items in real life with paper wallets is incomprehensibly stupid given the current state of bitcoin. How would you get change? How would you deal with constantly fluctuating prices? Why would merchants accept a currency with no protections, backings or any regulatory foresight?

You were just touting psychedelic treatments which are solely reliant on 5-HT downregulation. There is no such thing as a "non addictive" opioid drug because they all have the exact same mechanism of action. If the addictive aspect was removed, it could no longer be consider an opioid drug and wouldn't have the analgeisic effects associated with it.
I've never been of the opinion that SSRIs are any good; I don't think work at all, but suggesting opioid use to tackle mental illness is absolutely irresponsible and dangerous. It doesn't work, it can't work. You would need to create and entirely new family of magic drugs

My biggest issue is all that time grinding cash games and MTTs is doubly hard to profit because BTC is constantly fucking losing value. Makes it much much harder to be a profitable BTC poker player unless you are cashing out daily and holding fiat.
It's a sad state of affairs that BTC poker is nowhere near as popular as it should be, because the amount of active tables on the top sites is nothing short of pathetic.

That was the context I meant, sorry if that was not clear. That is just my experience, but looking at historical volume in USD from MtGox you can see how huge it was. Maybe there was a vibrant bitcoin trade back then that wasn't related to drugs, but I never really found anything other than people trading here and there on forums. (I don't think BTC volume from the lower price era is as meaningful to look at in retrospect)

Why would the bitcoin price stabilise? I don't think it will, and even if it does, it doesn't really effect how the network would operate as a payment processor. The real issue is, even if it is a payment processor, how does it compete with alternatives? Right now it doesn't, that is indisputable.
Comparing any past innovation to bitcoin is the same thing as people using log charts to predict the next bubble. The world is moving faster and faster than even. More has happened in the last 6 years in terms of technology than probably the entire last century, and bitcoin still remains fairly stagnant, offering nothing practical to anybody apart from exchanging wealth mostly illegally.

I don't think that was true for anyone who was alive around the time. A global interconnected information network vs. a clunky PoW network that eats electricity, rewards the defacto centralised processors disproportionately and for all intents and purposes, offers little practicality in the real world.
It even piggy-backs off the internet, and has for 6 years now. People could have been saying the same thing about beanie babies when they were popular for all we know, but it certainly doesn't mean they are analogous.

They're developing solutions to problems that don't exist, or ones they create themselves. There's no reason for any capital to flow in right now; the practical utility is the same as it was last year.

Opioid drugs are *only* for pain management because that's all the mechanism of action allows. It works the same way taking heroin for literally anything would work. They are not effective antidepressants and will never be used for that purpose.

I think drawing any comparisons between crypto and fiat currencies is not going to leave much for discussion.
I will say though at least the Ruble is backed by something. Call me a skeptic but a distributed network of number crunching space heaters does not fill me with confidence for backing a currency. You could almost extend what you said to say that bitcoin is literally backed by the USD that hits exchanges and the hopes of holders wanting to get rich.
The BTC wealth distparity is more pear-shaped that even the most corrupt fiat currencies today. Some people got very rich, some people did okay, and basically everyone who bought at any stage this year is deep in the red.
@_date: 2014-11-26 21:52:45
I'll take your word for it, I really don't have a knowledge of that sort of trade. Forget eBay then, how can OB compete with "cash in hand" or bank transfer payments on sites that are already huge and have essentially no listing fees.

Do you speculate much in gold? I remember all my life growing up everyone telling me it was THE hedge against inflation. If you look at historical charts and even inflation adjusted ones you'd see that gold is surprisingly risky.

The technology is certainly interesting but you seem to use Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in unison. I'm not yet sold on the possibilities of distributed blockchain technology because I haven't really seen anything in action that offers anything new, but I will be the first to change my opinion when something truly unique a valid niche.
Right now it doesn't fill any niche other than illicit activity payments and a head wrecking "store of value". In fairness though, even if the only people using BTC in 5 years were darknet markets I would still consider bitcoin a success. To a regular Joe it's just a bad kind of internet money.
@_date: 2014-11-14 11:49:32
That's chicken and egg reasoning. The blockchain is valuable because it solved a problem in computer science by allowing distributed trustless consensus. BTC is the medium of exchange that allows the framework to function.
The BTC network isn't really any more special than the others, it just has massively more hash power that isn't necessarily that good or bad. It technically makes the network more "secure" but at the same time the majority of mining operations are now defacto centralised.

Our definitions are the same. With a forever falling price and continually rising hashrate it's becoming harder and harder to return the same gains with every passing day.

Maybe a new altcoin pegged to existing reserve currencies with a 100% premine and an IPO for distribution of funds.
The block rewards could be similar to a PoS forging rather a PoW system where users would be incentivised to save and spend, offering some sort of system where unspent currency is constantly "forged" as a means of gaining interest to keep up with a predefined rate of inflation.
The forging would not require much electricity, allow the network to process instant transactions and not disproportionately reward the forgers/miners like how BTC does it.

They're the questions people don't want to address. As is stands there isn't a reason for any consumer to get bitcoin just to buy things with. And even if they did, they'd basically just be doing the fiat &lt;-&gt; bitcoin &lt;-&gt; fiat roundabout scheme through bitpay, coinbase or whatever.

Warren Buffett on gold:
Today the world's gold stock is about 170,000 metric tons. If all of this gold were melded together, it would form a cube of about 68 feet per side. (Picture it fitting comfortably within a baseball infield.) At $1,127 per ounce, its value would be about $9.6 trillion. Call this cube pile A.
Let's now create a pile B costing an equal amount. For that, we could buy all U.S. cropland (400 million acres with output of about $200 billion annually), plus 16 ExxonMobil's (the world's most profitable company, one earning more than $40 billion annually). After these purchases, we would have about $1 trillion left over for walking-around money (no sense feeling strapped after this buying binge). Can you imagine an investor with $9.6 trillion selecting pile A over pile B?
And yet, investors still do choose gold over these productive assets all the time. Assets that will be producing corn and cotton and oil and gas for longer than any of our lifespans. Meanwhile, the gold will be unmoved and still incapable of producing anything. To wit Buffett said, "You can fondle the cube, but it will not respond."

There ARE transaction fees; sending bitcoin is NOT free by any means.
Money is not moved instantly in practical terms. Sometimes confirmations take a very long time and honestly it's a bit of a joke that the future of currencies is that damn slow. It's embarrassing.
Delineating goods and services in a deflationary currency is impractical in the real world, arguably impossible.
The people with all the bitcoin are hackers, malware creators, thieves, scammers, drug dealers, and a few guys computer nerds who thought the idea was cool. A bigger proportion of scumbags own more bitcoin than the rich scumbags own fiat currency. The economic disparity between the elites and the poor is bigger than any fiat currency.
God help us all if bitcoin is actually used as a world currency in the future. A dystopian libertarian nightmare. That's what bitcoin in the real world is.

It's really hard to call it an investment when it doesn't really earn you anything sitting around idly. Even if you bought assuming the price would rise you would be speculating rather than investing.
I think the long term holders are going to do the worst out of the lot. There's nothing to suggest the price will ever reach epic proportions, or even touch the previous ATH again. At this point it almost seems like a fairy tale, and the only ones believing it are those who have lost the most.

The OP isn't a professional trader and it's much harder to trade downtrends if you're not staring at order books, monitoring market depths and able to make on the spot decisions. If he bought 2 days ago and forgot about it expecting a little jump he would have lost approximately $350 of his $10,000, which is presumably a few days work for him. Whereas if this was a time of a general uptrend the opposite would be true.
Unless he's a gambler and willing to lose a portion of what he puts in it's best to stay away entirely. New traders almost always, without fail, lose a lot of money. Just offering some free advice based on my experiences.

I own 0 dollars so it's not really much of a concern for me. I made my riches from BTC months back and have yet to buy back in, if ever. I don't like what I'm seeing at all. My analysis tells me it will keep going down, so I'm sticking with my instinct on this; it hasn't failed me yet and I've saved myself huge losses in purchasing power.
My gold/silver and interest rates on savings accounts essentially makes me immune to inflation for the time being. If you think I'm going to post actual pictures of my bank account, keep dreaming. I'm not forced to borrow anything and have 0 debts.
Saying Bitcoin is "honest" means absolutely nothing. It's mined, and it's sold. The spot price is what it is. It has nothing to do with maths or honestly, just speculation by the masses. People keep telling me I'm an idiot for selling the vast majority of my holdings for over $1,000! I don't know how to argue against that logic any more.

I wouldn't argue those drugs are safe in any way, and fully agree that some have horrible addiction potentials with arguably worse side effects than opioids. I would go as far as to say GABA withdrawal is more dangerous than opioid withdrawal 99 times out of 100!
I could never get behind an opioid prescription for below "baseline" levels of endorphins; I think it could only end badly. I agree that SSRIs for the most part completely suck and are have never been found more efficacious than placebo but even no drug has to be better than opioids for what is essentially depression.
In the instance linked I could understand a study like that if you used an opioid antagonist to backtrack but to outright treat a hypothesised endogenous opioid irregularity with exogenous opioids is impossible. It's a guaranteed way to make the observation worse.
I think how we view mental health is pretty fucked and mental illnesses are not well understood, that's why I was specifically involved in pain as an overall experience and how it effected people mentally. I used to think generalised depression was 5-HT related but after years of study and research I could only conclude that depression is in essence is a psychological manifestation of pain. That would explain why opioids are so good and treating people with depression but it doesn't mean it's a good idea to go that route in a clinical setting.

Sort of relevant Warren Buffet excerpt on comparing speculative hedge assets to land.
“If you put your money into gold or other non-income- producing assets that are dependent on what someone else values that in the future, you’re in speculation,” he said. “You’re not into investing....”
To illustrate the point, he asked readers to picture the world’s entire gold stock melded together into a cube 68 feet (21 meters) on each side valued at $9.6 trillion at then- prevailing prices. For the same amount, an investor could have purchased all the farmland in the U.S., 16 replicas of Exxon Mobil Corp., and still have about $1 trillion of “walking- around money.”
A century later, the farmland will be producing valuable crops no matter the currency, and dividends from the companies would probably added up to trillions of dollars, Buffett wrote.
The 170,000 metric tons of gold “will be unchanged in size and still incapable of producing anything,” he wrote. “You can fondle the cube, but it will not respond.”

Gold isn't really an investment though. You're buying it with the intent of the price rising; that's speculation. Gold is sort of unique in the sense that it's just such a traded commodity and has a long historical use but it has always been speculating. Sort of like with bitcoin when people say don't worry about the price, 1btc = 1btc. 1 oz = 1 oz
I would probably consider the latter investing. Even if it wasn't pegged and falling vs. CNY you would be receiving dividends. You can hold gold bubble after bubble but it's meaningless until you sell at a profit.

Maybe, I don't know. I think paying out miners ~$30 on average per transaction after 5 years is a little unusual and probably unsustainable (I know that's not exactly how it happens, or even close to it). Compared to banking that does it at virtually 0 cost, although obviously they take their cut. They're a business after all.

I think the major issue with using paper wallets in the real world is there's no way to verify they aren't counterfeit without the network which defeats the purpose of using paper bitcoin entirely.

I don't have a need for international bank transfers, similar to how most people don't. Worst case I can use credit cards and get a % back from them because I always pay on time. I don't care what my bank costs, as long as it doesn't cost me anything and continues to pay me interest on my savings account.
And yes the entire BTC network is incredibly inefficient. Glad we could agree on that in some roundabout fashion without having to dig into the nitty-gritty details of the true cost of transactions, which is of course, absolutely huge.

I can tell you that I don't pretend to know they're being spent on expenses, that's for sure. If you monitor small pools that are likely massive centralised mining operations that are holding a surprisingly large amount, as well as the huge majority of non-commercial miners who are simply holding.
You can tell by activity on exchanges that ~4,600 aren't being dumped every day, because on days when that many are dumped over a few hours there is phenomenal slippage that the price never recovers from. It's almost impossible to know how many are actually dumped, only how much is traded. I suspect if large amounts are ever dumped, they're usually just waiting to take out large buy walls to minimise slippage and get the most USD they can for it.

Amazon are an incredibly efficient and successful company already, who completely rely on fiat currency for every single step of their business model. Introducing a volatile speculative asset that doesn't function as well as current payment systems into any part of their current process would be an absolute nightmare no matter what way you look at it.
They don't want to accept it as currency, they certainly wouldn't hold it, they can't pay suppliers or staff with it, so what are they going to do with it? Surely the only reason isn't to have a public accounting system

Full reserve banking doesn't actually exist and has no real practical usage. What you're describing is essentially a safe, where you and a third party have the key, where the third party is responsible for safe and its contents. This does not really apply for coinbase or circle because you're buying a different currency from them, just to remove from their reserves.
This is better defined as a brokerage, with the sole purpose of processing payments and taking a cut on fees. Nothing even close to what a bank is.

The cost of transport is not anywhere near zero, even if you only take into consideration mandatory miner fees. Why on earth would you compare the transport of physical goods to the "transport" of BTC? Comparing it to digital money would have been a more apt example.

It's rare that there is more than $10m trade volume per day; today it is under 3 million for instance (a large portion of this is new mined blocks). Provided there was no liquidity issue it would still work anyway. 
A larger market cap has nothing to do with usefulness unless you're trying to move millions of USD across boarders regularly (assuming liquidity would allow it). Saying it doesn't make it true obviously, but the reality is that it is true, like it or not.
No need to attack me, I use bitcoin regularly and have been from 2009. I just completely disagree that 1 bitcoin will be worth billions one day based on nonsensical premises like what the OP or you are proposing. As I see it, at least today, BTC costing $100 or $500 has no impact on how useful it is. This is telling from the 9 month downtrend we are seeing since January.

I would consider any non-producing asset pure speculation. You're gambling on a price rise purely for capital gains. It's speculating by definition. Just because some people had a good run and made money on it doesn't make them investors, it makes them lucky that they bought and sold when they did. In that regard it's very similar to bitcoin.
If there were low risk ways of sitting your bitcoin somewhere and earning more bitcoin then fair enough. I think you can do this with crypto casinos, lending bitcoin and make some tiny % on exchanges. If it's worth it great, but if your BTC is sitting around in an address idle it's not an investment. It's the same as a gold bar buried in your yard doing nothing.

The marginal utility barely changes with respect to the price, unless you're talking about moving millions, or even billions across seas without liquidity issues fucking you in the ass there is no reason whatsoever 1 BTC should ever be really expensive.

Why will the price rise consistently though? This is what I don't get. Fair enough, the halvening might have an impact on price. I'm totally on board with that despite the uncertainty, but the uncertainty brings its own questions of mining/production efficiency. It's hard to tell if the "bottom" is defined by marginal returns on the most efficient mining or the actual cost of the ASICs factoring in electricity afterwards and operational costs afterwards.

It's different being a web dev and somebody paying you with bitcoin, but if you have a regular office job you are never going to see BTC as part of your pay roll.
There will always be the issue if people getting paid directly in BTC are avoiding tax and right now it's sort of impossible to regulate, and too difficult to ever regulate practically imo.

That's just so unlikely though, and BTC being the dominant currency in that scenario has to be even less likely. Food would become the top commodity, or skills.

To be fair, you get a lot of level headed discussion in if you can see around the trolling. Most over there do not have a vested interest but still have deep knowledge of how it works. Most here and in BMarkets just want to get rich quick and don't want to discuss the potential of losing "money".
Last thing I have to say about mining at the moment, it's as if a BTC floor price has been set loosely around the real cost of mining (we're well above that at the moment as I've noted with the disproportionate payouts). I think the spot price has the potential to break that bottom and cause a right shitstorm for people who own a lot of hardware, and the speculative value of BTC will decrease over time.
Everyone's entitled to their opinion. I sold my holdings for 17% profits at ~ $610 based off my analysis (probably just luck/coincidence). Good luck in your ventures!

Don't fill responses with terms that don't relate to the reality of the situation. The fact that bitcoin is deflationary (not actually deflationary until like 2140) or that they might even lose 1% a year to inflation (compared to bitcoin's absurd volatility) is completely irrelevant to some who has barely enough money to survive.

Honestly a good diversification of savings right now is physical silver, bitcoin is just constantly losing purchasing power for the last 14 months pretty much, I think that's dangerous to put too much into it, especially if you can't afford it which was my original point.
If you asked someone with no money would they like their payments in an asset that has month-on-month lost value for the last 14 they would probably look at you as if you're the stupidest person they've ever met.
That's assuming they even have the technology available to them to transact in cryptocurrency which presumably they can't afford anyway.

I know a lot of poor people, and many got that way because they are not astute enough to understand risk/reward analysis, basically like every who went "all in" with bitcoin. It's absolutely horrendous risk management, and because some people got stupid lucky and made millions is not rational justification enough for doing it.
Putting savings into bitcoin as a hedge against fiat currency has historically never been a good idea just because of the volatility alone. Some got lucky, the vast majority have lost greatly trying to hedge.
Personally I have no idea why being able to buy a satoshi is a good thing. There's nowhere in the world you can even buy something so cheap. All countries have relevant denominated currencies that already work for them.
I have yet to read one reasonable circumstance why someone who has very little money, or just barely enough to get buy should put it all into bitcoin. It's absurd
@_date: 2015-01-15 13:25:51
It's really hard to say how much liquidity would be effected. Since exchanges started using leveraged instruments for BTC, liquidity hasn't really been as problematic as it has been in the past.
Exchanges have tonnes of coins themselves too so they could essentially be the providers, but I completely understand what you're saying. I think the amount of $ moving is the limiting factor rather than the cost of a bitcoin.

I think the fundamental issue here is people accepting BTC on the either end. If you already have BTC and want to send it to someone who will accept BTC then it can be convenient.
Despite the opinions of this sub, very very few people in the world use BTC in any meaningful form. Most are holders, some just like using it and keep buying back from exchanges at a loss to themselves (I don't get why anyone would do this).
You would need a brick and mortar who essentially mimic BitPay/Coinbase but only dispense fiat but can make it more affordable than WU. If it ever came to that (hard to say given the infrastructural costs) WU would undoubtedly reduce their rates. It's evident that it isn't affordable with BTC because WU just do not care about BTC and there are no start ups to offer a remittance service.
What are your thoughts?
@_date: 2014-08-25 20:09:09
It's really the uncertainty that gets me. I actually understand exactly how mining works, I just can't get my head around how it will continue working in the future. Anyone who says they know is lying imo.
I guess if you don't place a $ value on block rewards and consider them speculatory assets it sort of makes sense. It's as if the "market cap" should constantly increase with more coins being mined but obviously that isn't the case if people aren't buying up all the new blocks at spot price.
I think we could talk about this forever because it is really interesting but I think the rewards for processing the network transactions are grossly disproportionate to the actual network activity, and to me this means the spot price can do nothing but gradually decrease slowly over time, with the obvious anomalies around reward halvenings.
People assume BTC will just keep rising and maybe it will, but there is definitely more being mined every day than there is new people buying coins, and with ASICs improving constantly in terms of efficiency, I think this can only accelerate the process of the drop in spot price. Most seem to think more ASIC or small processors means more money but really it means everyone else mining is getting proportionately less.

I want a free market, but only one that works exactly how I want it to!

Why wouldn't someone just use PayPal? It's so much cheaper than this.

The same user couldn't elaborate on his magic antivirus blockchain OS when pressed on it. Honestly it seemed like he had no idea what he was talking about and no formal qualification in the field he claimed to be a paid professional in.

The fee is the core problem for you. I would say try to make it competitive and work around that. 10% is far too much. Good luck

No it doesn't. Water just moves around.

That doesn't answer my only question though. Consumers need the in-depth analysis in byte-size form with facts. If it's not cheaper than existing systems and not easy to use it really doesn't matter what sort of accounting system they use or what digital tokens they peg the native currencies to.

Impossible for someone to commit suicide after losing their life savings on a bitcoin exchange that scammed them. Couldn't ever happen.
Need pics of dead bodies or just plain FUD here guys.
@_date: 2015-02-08 13:32:13
They are not provably fair and have been scamming users a long time.

This is too ridiculous it can't be serious.

The first people of America raped and pillaged an indigenous people to get what they wanted. Roger Ver and Satoshi really didn't take many risks or really do that much of anything, they just happened to get insanely lucky by bitcoin being pumped to shit by MtGox.
Anyone can't get 400,000 Bitcoins. If 35 people owned 400k each then they would own more bitcoins than the total amount in "circulation".

[REAL THUG](
@_date: 2015-02-19 12:12:01
I'm not referring to anything in particular, just that massive amounts of people lost far more than they could afford to lose on MtGox.
People kill themselves over a lot less. Asking for proof about a bitcoin related suicide is just so scummy.

What would the bitcoin blockchain do for world finance though? I think people really stretch their imaginations with this topic.
If by some miracle it did happen, global financial information would be on a public unalterable ledger and everything would be exactly the same, except instead of hiring security professionals to pentest your systems, you would just have processors crunching numbers to keep the network secure.

Are bitcoin spenders already paying a premium to get bitcoin *and* paying the credit inflated product prices? I don't get it.
@_date: 2015-02-01 17:30:58
That's like saying the world's surface changes depending on where you stand because you change the density of the land under your feet. Technically true, but meaningless in this context.

This is nothing new. I've seen many many provably fair bitcoin lotteries already. They all end up the same. Lotteries are boring and the chance of winning is so tiny.

People who start pyramid schemes often get so rich they never need to work again. The ones late to the part all lose all their money.
In essence, what happening with bitcoin in all of 2014.
@_date: 2015-03-06 22:54:24
If everyone using it now was using a different, more refined decentralised cryptocurrency in 10 years time then BTC's effective worth would be virtually nil. It's not impossible that something like that could happen.

I think that's a fundamental misunderstanding of how companies generate their profits vs. a speculative asset with some utility that produces nothing.
Gold absolutely does not outperform those companies. It has lost like 30% of it's value since the ATH in 2011.
In the last 4 years those companies have generated real profits (although nowhere near the profits you'd expect). The same gold has been sitting in vault that time, earning nothing.

Or maybe it's because OP is threatening a legitimate company with a fraudulent chargeback because he's so butthurt over legitimate fees.
What if he uses bitcoin and never receives his item?

Anyone who sends 1 satoshi to this guy is going to lose that satoshi. It's an elaborate scam obviously set up to rob you.
If offers nothing. Don't send your bitcoins. Nonsense buzzword talk and promises the sun and stars.

Debt precludes banking, they just made it a lot cheaper to take it on. Blame people, not money.
@_date: 2015-02-01 20:04:24
That is basically exactly what BitPay and Coinbase are for, except their fees are much lower than 10%.

Land isn't a finite resource, it's constantly being created where plate boundaries diverge.

Buys what things? Who's making things if nobody works and just hodls their blockchain tokens?
How can it go up in value if people aren't buying it? If people don't work they have no money.
There's so much wrong with your train of thought it's nearly impossible to tackle that level of stupidity head on.

I'm not a trolling. I'm calling out someone for their ridiculous ideas like everyone else should.

No AI would conciously chose an unnecessarily wasteful minting process for a currency. It all sounds a bit hocus pocus to me.
@_date: 2015-02-21 10:27:21
It would be likely that AI would use the fastest most energy efficient currency known. So either something with really fast blocks or a form of currency that isn't even related to cryptocurrency. It could never be bitcoin

Bitcoin evangelism is a pretty niche area though, let's be fair. I've seem interviews of him claiming he's not an expert in any of this, he just does it for fun and loves the technology.

So people who can afford to not work don't have to work, good to know
