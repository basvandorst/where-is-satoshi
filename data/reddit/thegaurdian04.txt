I am going to have to agree with you. Although I have have not been it this for long the only part of this system that has interested me has been the idea of the control of money taken away from a single group, like the government, and given to each and every person. That is what I see bitcoin being. Now I am not someone with a mining rig that can, has ,or ever will, give me a passive way of acquitting bitcoin easily. I use my own fiat rah paycheck and collect what I can.  Because of this I can’t see a good way to spend my bitcoin at the moment while still trying to save and grow what I have. Because that is my goal, to keep as much as I can till the day comes where the price becomes flat and spending 10$ today will still be spending 10$ a week from now.

That has nothing to do with being bullish or bearish. It means more people at getting in too and out of the market.  If anything the current trend... the one we have been on for over is getting stronger. Nothing new going on.

I’d say $2300 is more likely going to be the very bottom and that is only if there can be a bounce back up to around the $3000 area. If not then it could keep sliding to the mid $1000’s. It will be a cold winter.

People with money fighting between going up and going down lol there really is no good reason for them just hold on and let it play out.

Why would you think that was right? After you sold the price continues to go too $20,000. 
To me that sounds like you made the wrong decision and sold far to early. Now I’m not saying that I have any great talent in trading assets as a career but I know enough that selling near the top is never a bad idea and buying near the bottom is the way to at least not miss out on an easy opportunity.

You do realize that there can be bull rallies while still a bear market. This might happen for a little bit but we still have yet to see the end of the bear market.
