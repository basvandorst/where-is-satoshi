Let's not over look the fact that the number one currency, by far, for drug deals and other illegal activities is USD.

Maybe that is because it is illegal to accept bitcoin as payment in Vietnam.

So is the map exposing where they have their money transmitter licenses? if so, then maybe we should update this wikipedia entry...

There is also a string of words (Mnemonic Phrase) they give you which can be used to recover your password. Highly suggest saving those somewhere safe too.

Back in 1998, some friends and I were working on building timestamp.com to offer a similar service. We were using SMTP and some crazy HP tamper proof PCI cards that sync'd time over the air with GPS signals. Unfortunately, we lost steam and motivation and never launched.

I just checked your address and it doesn't look like you've bought anyone beer yet.

I agree, having a global transaction register is amazing balls. It is something we definitely didn't have back in 1998.
The cards were wrapped in glass and filled with an inert gas. If you messed with them at all, they stopped working. I'm not sure if they ever went to any sort of commercial production.
Sweet! I just found the patent:   Interesting that it took them a few years to file it.

This sold me on bluebird...

Yes! I just set that up. =)

Not bad. I do like your clustering of the api definitions as a json object.
That said, I'd prefer it if you exposed a promises based api so that I don't have to live in callback hell. bluebird is the library to use for that.
Side note, I created this:

Sure! Keep me in the loop.

The difference is that those companies set the price because they also control the market. Miners don't set the price, the market does.

And this...

Does anyone know where the funds were recovered from? I see one person mention they were test funds to another exchange, but does anyone have any proof of that?

Not if they can't turn it on because they haven't paid their power or hosting or xyz bills.
For example, Giga-watt just declared bankruptcy.
