"write down your seed" LUL
Do you really think any normal person goes through all the hassle? 
@_date: 2018-11-21 11:23:56
True, the only way Bitcoin can survive is if people see it as digital gold and not money.
I never understood why store of value is like a bad word in the community.
I actually like that more, even if 1 transaction takes a hole day, who cares if its just for big transactions.

"Bounce  back" it will take years to recover.

I agree, why has there not been a huge push for decentralized exchanges by now?
They are the only hope but somehow there is no news wierd.
