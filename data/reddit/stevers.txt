I have had zero issues as well and have done at least 6 wire transfers.  
Each one has been over a few thousand dollars.   Follow the directions they email you and just verify the wire transfer form your bank fills out for you matches up.
I suggest trying a smaller wire transfer first just to get comfortable.  The very FIRST one I did was only for $100.  (There's a $30 charge from my bank for wire transfers, haha... butI wasn't comfortable trying that process fo rthe first time with any substantial amount of money).

I know Gemini wasn't supporting the Segwit2x fork that was cancelled in November, which caused a huge uproar.  You'll have to watch the news feeds straight from your exchanges (i recommend going on twitter too).
At this point i dont know what websites to trust anymore regarding bitcoin news...  so the only news i'll take as Gospel will be the information i read straight from Coinbase's website and their twitter, as well as Gemini's website and their twitter.
(I'm also on Binance and Bitstamp for altcoins)
I dont know of any upcoming forks, but I'm also not a veteran bitcoin holder.

Buy Tesla stuff.  It's one way to invest in something good!

It was a scam website that CoinTelegraph published an article on.  Shame on them. I'm never reading their articles again.
But if the segwit2x fork does come back around, you need to make sure you're on an exchange that supports it, or you need to take your bitcoins offline to a wallet.

Honestly you should registered and verified for the following:
* Gemini
* Bitstamp
* Binance
* Coinbase
If you're into bitcoin then you're probably also paying attention to other cryptocurrencies.  Personally, I have BTC, ETH, LTC, and IOTA.  I did dabble in Ripple for short trading but i feel dirty buying into Ripple :/
I'm about 90% BTC, 10% altcoins at the moment, but I plan on diversifying a bit more as it has been pretty profitable doing short trading on altcoins while leaving the bulk of my money in the far less risky bitcoin.
(i know i just said a crypto is "less risky..." lol).  But GIVEN that I understand cryptos are risky to begin with, then my statement still stands.

We are certainly enabling bitcoin soon for our own website, but that does not carry near the traffic that a website such as Amazon or Ebay.

I sincerely appreciate everyone's feedback.   Thank you so much.  OneWallet looks great.

Well I apologize for not being in "the know" and appreciate you educating me.  WHen you say "the network" what are you referring to?
@_date: 2015-01-16 20:51:52
That's certainly one way to look at it.  Do you purchase frequently with BitCoin?  If so, where do you go?  If not, what are you doing with your BitCoin?

Thank you! It seems a few people have mentioned this.   I am looking forward to it coming out of the Beta.

I was going to OpenBazaar.com &gt;&lt;.

Edit: How do we participate in the beta?

Yes we have our own website  , we will be enabling bitcoin soon.  My issue is that sites such as shopify.com do not carry nearly the exposure that AMazon or Ebay carries.

Hey did your transfer finally go through?
I am experiencing the exact same thing.  I did a very small test transfer.  It went through almost immediately.  Now im doing a much larger transfer and its not showing up anywhere.
