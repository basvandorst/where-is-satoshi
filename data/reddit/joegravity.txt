If LN is implemented successfully and fees are smaller then eth and fast... then I believe BTC will live on indefinitely as the top dog of crypto world.

Can anyone explain to me quickly what it would take to be a LN node?

I love this meme. Truthfully, don’t necessarily see the relevance to crypto but it’s spot on.

Sorry noob question— what’s cme?

Can’t go wrong with being debt free for the rest of your life my brother. Cheers to you!

If you bought a house cash with some of that money, and you have no mortgage... you put yourself into a great position. No matter what happens to bitcoin, or the economy you will most likely always need a place to live. And it doesn’t hurt to live rent/mortgage free. I’d be doing that now

I heard about bitcoin way back in 2009. I remember many of my freedom minded friends encouraging everyone to buy but I was too stupid to be thinking of an investment opportunity. I can’t help but look back at what $100 of bitcoin would be worth now.... I know I know... Hindsight is 20/20. But mannnnn

I can only sit here and say this as someone kicking myself for not doing what you did way back then.  Kudos to you btw man for having the foresight i didn’t. Anyways this is what i say— People won’t like it but i don’t care. It’s exactly what I’d do if i were in your shoes
You should sit down and talk to a tax guy or financial expert about the best way to do this. I’d also tell your wife. Sit her down first explaining that, while it’s a lot of money it may be worth more in the future. Life should get much easier. I’d cash out 100 btc.  I would buy the house you want   ( stick to that price range listed) and pay it off in cash.  No mortgage. Then I’d pay off all debts. With no mortgage or debts ( including cars and minor debts) you have a tremendous amount of saving power. Then whatever is left over from that cashed out BTC is then invested into mutual funds, stocks etc. diversify. Let’s face it— we all are big on the prospect of BtC working out but if for whatever reason it falls apart... you’d have a paid off house and investments that are going to work for you. And if btc ends up being 100k each you are even in better shape. Either way with no mortgage or rent you should put that extra money to investments and 401ks. Retire within a few years ( if you want ).  Tell wifey she doesn’t need to work anymore if she doesn’t want to at least not where she is. She should be pretty happy about that. 
I personally wouldn’t worry about divorce unless you feel something is awry? I just don’t think it’s healthy to prepare for what could happen anyway.

But i thought the flippening was happening??? More like the Floppening.

Wow!!! There is sooo much you packed into this piece! I really fricken love it! I love the eye looking toward the the sky and the resistance around the 6k bottom. Great job!

I was going to say the ultimate tribute is if you accept BtC for pizza. Very cool!

Wondering why the price recently spiked?
