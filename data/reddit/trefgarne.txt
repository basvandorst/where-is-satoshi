The product is essentially a bitcoin wallet and payment platform. It lets you fund your account via either a bank account or credit card, and then send those funds to others. You can also request payments via bitcoin too. Think zero-fee PayPal.

Its a cool product. Its still very simple, but its easy to use and works very well. What functionality they have is rock solid. They've clearly been focussed on backend/security, because the actual features in the user interface feel relatively fundamental, but it feels like a strong starting point to build from.

I have a Circle account. I received the invitation a few weeks ago, along with a $10 bitcoin credit. I’d never used bitcoin before, but had obviously read a lot and wanted to find a relatively simple user-friendly way to try it out. The product is super easy to use, very well designed etc. It makes Bitcoin super accessible and you can totally envisage how products like this could turn bitcoin from being a relatively niche market into a mainstream financial product. A mobile app would be huge though.

The USD balance does fluctuate based on the value of bitcoin.
