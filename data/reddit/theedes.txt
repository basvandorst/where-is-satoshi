The same reason why MLMs, cults and ponzi schemes get people to dump money into them, the dream that you will get great gains from spending money into them, and hoping that it might be enough to dig you out of whatever hole you feel like you're in.

Yet if you would even care about the price you are most definitely here to speculate on its value. If you truly cared about the technology you wouldn't be worried about 10 year old tech that has barely changed. And it's not truly immutable, it is in fact very mutable. Blockchains have forked to undo transactions (for example, ethereum and the DAO), and the mechanism to choose the most relevant chain (length, computing power) didn't vouch for the immutable version of the coin.

It's not really a case of bitcoin fixing anything, basically their currency is really hyperinflated, along with the fact that the government sets the prices on everything, including the exchange rates for the US dollar. 
So basically you could buy an apple, which "officially" (by the official exchange rate) is worth $1, but in the USD black market is actually worth $0.10, take it on a flight and sell it in the US and make a profit (albeit a very small one).
Now this is where bitcoin comes in, even if you could produce $1 of bitcoin at $1 cost in electricity (which they don't), they'd actually have to pay an actual cost of $0.10, and then they can trade it for USD directly, and get back the $1, which easily pays off their bill. 
And then just to add the cherry on top electricity is super cheap, like disgustingly cheap, like almost free cheap. So basically they can have these servers on all day producing free (inflation free, at least from their perspective) money that is safe from an eventual government/currency collapse.
Also, don't take my exact numbers, I'm not sure what the ratio of official USD exchange rate vs real USD exchange rate, although I think it's worse than 1:10.

Because they have been dragging the price down with their  incompetence some people would rather they just die already.

Yeah, I went ahead and looked up on the trezor, sounds like a pretty good idea to use the sansa clip to replace the trezor, it might even be more secure.

The same reason you don't get double spending on bitcoins. You sign your update with your private key and then the miner who mines the block verifies it's really you, and then the miner who verifies the next block verifies it's you again and so forth, it's very unlikely to get exploited since you need to mine a lot of blocks in a row, and that if you had the kind of power to exploit the network you'd probably want to be mining anyway.

Dude look at the scale, that was a 1% fluctuation, bitcoin regularly has 5% fluctuations on a stable day.

I'm pretty sure some of them exchange bitcoin to fiat and fiat to bitcoin.
Also it's to keep it in that "money" theme.

Oh, that's pretty cool, I really wasn't sure if microsoft would allow one on their store but apparently they did, nice to know. I never really checked because I don't have a windows phone and don't even know where to check their app store.

Oh yes, I was thinking about that too, since you can store the entire pirate bay in a couple of megabytes, why not make a coin with the bitcoin algorithm that let's you store magnet links to the blockchain?

People are only saying that they want gox to die because they consider the coins in gox to be lost already. They just don't want gox to skim around the fact that they lost everyone's bitcoins causing small drops every time they do something stupid. You're also forgetting the fact that they have caused a couple of crashes before.

As I said in my first comment, I haven't actually researched this fully, I did search for their plan just now and found [this part of the article]( which explains how they plan to guard against malicious participants in the network.
@_date: 2017-08-07 18:58:42
From what I read, the plan was to shard the blockchain along the network, but I haven't looked into exactly how it works. I've always wondered why no one has suggested sharding the blockchain in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-07 19:16:35
Everyone can have the block headers of every block like they're doing right now, and if someone changes an old block, the headers won't match up. You don't need the full block to check if it's tampered. About them being lost, you can't guarantee it, but you can design systems that have a high probability (abritrarily high) of not losing part of them.

When the currency crashes and burns because it failed to gain critical mass outside of freedom nutters trying to evade taxes and their money and mining hardware becomes worthless they'll see how good their choices went.
