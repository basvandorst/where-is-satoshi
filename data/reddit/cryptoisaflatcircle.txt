I agree. When though? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:06:52
Laughed again.
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:25:29
Maxed out at the moment. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:18:05
Literally bounced. Never seen that before. I'm not sure it was even a real price.
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:19:12
Another huge drop. Tired of seeing red.
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:04:25
900 gain for BTC last 40 minutes. Barely any red candles. Love it.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:59:57
How much are you hodling? +/- $100?
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:23:37
Nano. Tried that address, didn’t return anything. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:54:02
where do you see BCH on binance? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:00:00
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:01:40
They were in coinbase. Answer above says they have to release them. Thanks!

Can we have a serious discussion about what we think turns this bear run around? All I'm seeing in the news is shit. All I'm seeing around here is fees/speed are shit. There are many altcoins doing well, and now this shit with BCH. What turns this around?
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:31:35
People here are funny. Everytime someone is extremely happy when the price goes down, all I can think about is them holding about $50 worth of Bitcoin, max. There are people here with 500x that.

BCH price crashing and I can't sell it. Damnit.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:53:33
I laughed out loud.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:01:33
Just watched BTC go to 14.5 in minutes and back to 16.8 in seconds. Holy shit.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:51:48
Been HODLING since 2014.  Will probably take some profits soon and keep some in. Seeing what's going on with BCH makes me nervous. When Coinbase adds these new altcoins, I'm not sure what's going to happen and I'd love to buy in again if BTC drops further.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:06:36
Binance. Pretty easy to use.
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:24:11
Can anyone direct me on how to cash out my bcash balance. I had Btc before the fork. What address do I input to check my balance?
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:39:45
I hear ya. Not good to see red with those numbers in play.
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:01:20
Aha. Coinbase has to release them. That’s where they were when it split. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:02:07
Where on Binance? I can’t find it searching. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:06:56
Seems to be a little resistance now. Need to blow through mid 17s.
