Did anyone loose any serious money at GLBSE or is it a win-win operation so far?
edit: spelling
@_date: 2012-06-14 11:23:55
What about pirate funds?
@_date: 2012-06-13 02:13:20
Wouldn't prizes affect the economy too much?

Thank you :-)

Ahhhh if it was that obvious ;) You are very confident!

...stuff like books, an instrument or maybe a bunker.

 what do you mean by 'securities'? I'm not familiar with this term.
@_date: 2012-06-13 02:07:29
Yeah that was quite a show :) I'm glad it happened though, facebook is a nasty spy
@_date: 2012-06-14 11:23:11
just for simplicity, I know the difference :)

Any tips ;)? 
From what I see there are pirate funds, mining operations and anonymous high risk operations. Did I miss anything? The pirate funds look stable and the income is great
@_date: 2012-06-12 23:34:52
Why is that a bad thing?
@_date: 2012-08-11 18:01:10
Complete jibberish
@_date: 2012-06-14 11:35:40
Did you loose anything yet? Or maybe you almost did? If so, why? It looks too good to be true..
@_date: 2012-08-11 18:00:00
I'm 100% sure banking lobby is behind that "leak"
@_date: 2012-08-04 21:18:06
1.9% per week is also absurd high, and nobody is calling hash king a scammer.

Will pay for what? If there will be no point in mining, there will be no pools, there will be no organised infrustructure relying the transactions. Please elaborate :)
Do you mean that transaction fees will also be profitable, and that the most efficient pools will stay profitable as well?
