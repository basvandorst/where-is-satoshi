cool thanks for all the help, I remember reading somewhere that people who use adfly don't really care about users and just care about click throughs but I can see your genuinely trying to be helpful.

Basically I'd like to mine to gain some bitcoins I don't know how the whole wallet system works. Do i transfer into a wallet when mined? Do i get a wallet before i begin mining? what client should i use? i meant questions like this. 
Sorry for being confusing, but when you don't know the terminology it's hard to get your point across.

OK where should I begin first off lets talk about what ebay is. ebay allows you to buy goods online and have them delivered to your house. Like most transactions in the world you pay for your goods FIRST, then receive them. This means you are putting your trust in the seller to deliver, so what about if the seller trys to con you, no worries luckily ebay has this "fantastic" service called paypal. What they do is give you buyer protection where if you don't get your item, or its significantly different you get your money back. Another added level of confidence is that you must verify your ID when registering for the paypal service meaning you have the sellers home address and their name but all that is not significant for you once you've got your money back. Ignoring paypal completely if you pay via credit card you bank offers you a type of protection similar to ebays where you can complain and get your money back. Now the many advantages of bitcoin are also it's downfall when it comes to trust of the selling party. The fact that its decentralised means that there is no one to guarantee payment, no one to complain to if it goes wrong, sure you could complain to ebay and get the sellers account abnned but bitcoin transactions are one way, they can't be reversed, they can't be traced to a person only to a string of characters. Ebay could do something where to use bitcoins you must also register a credit card for them to keep on file but that defeats the entire purpose of bitcoins. Ebay could then just take it from the credit card. Going back to the problem where your money is not yours.
Well I think I've elaborated enough for now. By all means I hope i'm proved wrong the more places which accept bitcoin the more it cements it's place as a true decentralised currency. Although I only posses 0.001 BTC I am fully behind it.
