f) What constitutes an "excessive" salary? More than a fair market rate.  But we are not paying ourselves.  Please see here:  
e) How do enforce the rule that prevents members of your board from having conflicts of interest?
The Laws of the State of Washington, USA.
d) What guarantees the new non-profit entity will have the same rules and not simply convert to a for-profit company and sell the IP to the highest bidder?
The Laws of the State of Washington, USA.
c) Don't care.
b) How do you enforce this?
The Laws of the State of Washington, USA.
a) How would we know that this is being enforced?
The Laws of the State of Washington, USA.  Additionally Tax filings with the IRS and Washington State Department of Revenue.  We have to follow the same laws as the Red Cross, the local food bank, or any other non-profit.

Most people aren't able to run bitcoin exchanges either nor build any kind of bitcoin technology.  
If you expect bitcoin to take off, you must include the other 99% people who have no idea how to code into your thinking.

How about their work? They have smart enigineers on salary developing the next inventive steps. They aren't open sourcing theses ideas. They are patenting them. And can use the court to bar you from their use if they want.
Patents get us a seat at the table to discuss the future of our economy. If we only open source, decisions are made without us and won't be in our favor.

The US and other western countries where companies like Overstock, Coinbase, ZeroBlock, etc. borrow their money from are heavily patent dependent economies.  Yes, the customers may be in places where people don't have bank accounts but the money is stored in place where people do.
Also, as a little aside, the patent system in China in becoming more robust everyday.
@_date: 2014-05-13 17:02:19
This is a good point.

We will use the patents as a deterrent against bad actors.  When we band together many independent innovators into a public interest group, our patents are many times more effective.
For example, one small tech company with one patent likely cannot afford to file a reactionary lawsuit against Western Union.  Together, we might be able to achieve this monumental task.

How do you think these credit card companies will choose to deal with this threat? 
They will use their massive patent portfolios to limit the adoption of cryptocurrency technologies around the world for decades to come...  
They will sue Coinbase, BitPay, and the other exchanges.
They will sue Overstock, Tigerdirect, Gyft, and other retailers.
These lawsuits will cost us all a lot of money and time.
We need a unified defense to this impending attack. The Cryptocurrency Defense Foundation is working to circle the bitcoin community's wagons and provide for a common defense by aggregating our intellectual property into a single formidable portfolio.

Just because you and your buddies agree that anything that is derived from your work should be "free" to everyone, it doesn't supplant the US Constitution.
Gaining a patent on something you create that is patentable subject matter, is novel, and is unobvious if you constitutional right regardless of any agreement to the contrary.
More specifically, these "bitcoin patents" that are in the media today are NOT patents on bitcoin.  They are patents on embodiments of Bitcoin use.

Our organization is not intended to support any particular organization.  Our goal is to act as a deterrent to those using government monopolies to constraint competition.  We act as a counter weight to balance out the negative effects of the patents system.
By minimizing the impact of patents on the cryptocurrency economy, we allow companies to compete on quality of product and service.
It seem like we may agree: We should do what we can to let the market decide which companies survive and for how long.
The Linux community has adopted a similar practice of patent aggregation and it now the OS for +1billion people.  
The 3D printing community did not and they are only just now coming to market though the first 3D printer was invented in 1984.  
Our organization is about practical solutions.

In order to gain the protection of a patent license you need to affirmatively agree to it. We are not at that stage yet but basically: 
if your company uses Bitcoin, you will need to "sign up" for membership to receive the license (it's free). 
The license will state that it is only valid if you don't sue other members. If  you do sue one of our members, your license is revoked and you go on our naughty list. We intend use every resource available to defend our members from you.
The Open Invention Network for Linux has a similar license.
Forgive my typos. On my phone.

Great question and a valid concern.  As a non-profit organization established in Washington State, USA, we are obligated to file articles of incorporation stating that our organization can only act in the best interest of the cryptocurrency community.  Any action contrary to these articles may be a violation of law and may make us individually liable.
Specifically these articles must clearly:
(a) prohibit the distribution of any net earnings to members, directors, officers or other private persons and prohibit the organization from carrying on noncharitable activities.
(b) prohibit political action and lobbying
(c) require at least one member of the board of directors not be an employee of the organization
(d) require, in the event of our bankruptcy, that we donate our assets to another non-profit entity. 
(e) prohibit members of the board of directors from having interests contrary to the stated goals of the organization (conflict of interest policy).
(f) prohibit excessive salaries
Our goal is to be as transparent as possible.  When our non-profit status is granted by the government, we expect to post our articles of incorporation publicly.
If at any time you think we are not being as transparent as possible, please call us on our shit.  Our goal is to be a cornerstone of the cryptocurrency community for decades to come.

Hi john_winklevoss,
Thanks for the homework. You are right on about us not being registered yet. We were founded less than 3 months ago. We are still working through the process with our lawyers/accountants.  As you know, these things take time and need to be right the first time with the US government. We are expecting a year or more until 503(c)(3) status is granted by IRS.  We  also expect some serious debate with the IRS because the nature of our business is atypical (i.e. we are not a cookie cutter church.). 
You're also right that Reed Jessen (me), an IP analyst, is one of the founders.  WhoIs Guard is the default, free option when you register with a new domain with namecheap.com and I didn't think to change it. I will do that first this morning when I get to a desktop. Thanks for the heads up.
We'll also be putting up bios of our team. I seen now that it is important.
I blog at PreferredEmbodiment.com if you want to read more about me.
What other kind of information should we provide to help the community become comfortable with our intentions?
@_date: 2014-05-14 06:25:44
Practical question, If you open source everything, who stop Wells Fargo from suing everyone trading cryptocurrency?
@_date: 2014-06-10 23:17:49
This is why we need to band together as a community and take a aggressive stance when it comes to IP assets.  
The Cryptocurrency Defense Foundation is building a robust defensive patent portfolio to protect all members of the cryptocoin community from patent trolls as well as repression from established transaction companies.
The patents we acquire will be licensed openly to everyone who plays by the rules and only be used to retaliate against bad actors like patent trolls and those who want to shut down this new economy with patent litigation.

We are currently viewing this as our personal contribution to the bitcoin community and working on a volunteer basis.  We are not coders or developers. We are IP professionals and view this as the way we can help the progress of bitcoin.
We all have good day jobs which take care of our needs and don't expect any salaries for the time being.  We would use donations to purchase patents, pay patent maintenance fees, help inventors get new patents, as well as admin fees like website, travel expenses to conferences, etc. 
Bottomline, this is not going to make us rich.  We just think it is a really important thing for bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-06-18 14:37:30
It is defined in detail in the articles of incorporation which are being work on now. Any advice on the best phrasing?
@_date: 2014-06-18 16:28:49
An oversight on my part.  
Namecheap.com gives you free whois guard for a year when you register a new domain by default.  I just didn't pay attention.
I have now disabled it.
@_date: 2014-05-14 21:49:12
You are right. These companies also have huge patent portfolios and a currently patenting cryptocurrency technology. They will use these patents to retard adoption of cryptocurrency for as long as possible.

Developing and maintaining a formidable patent portfolio is not cheap.   We are looking at a few different funding options.
We need your contributions at this early stage.  There are a lot of startup costs associated with creating a non-profit and squiring our first patent assets.  Ideally, we would like to survive on contributions from the community but that doesn't seem realistic.
Membership fees for companies over a certain size might be a more realistic stream of funding.  The Bitcoin Foundation and the Open Invention Network have similar systems.  We think it's reasonable that for-profit companies pay for the services we provide them.
If we need to file a lawsuit against a bad actor or defend one of our members from a patent troll, we might use crowdfunding like the EFF did with their "Save Podcasting" campaign:  
Technology partnerships with leading retailers might also be an option.  
If you have any other ideas, please reach out to us.  Funding is a serious issue for us in these early days.
Please contribute to our cause.

Every time something is invented you face a choice, patent it or not.  They will always patent. If you always dont patent, at the nd of the day they have tons of patents and you have nothing.
Simply put, They are going to pay their engineers to develop the next inventive step of the cryptocurrency technology, patent it, and the exclude us from using it for 20 years. 
If you open source everything you have no leverage in the relationship. They have all the power.
@_date: 2014-06-18 14:33:41
Patent licenses are executory contracts which means the survive a bankruptcy. If we grant a lifetime, royalty free, worldwide license, it will continue with the patent no matter what happens to us.

OK, so until a patent -free world comes to pass might this be a good compromise?

I don't understand the question.
@_date: 2014-05-15 17:12:36
Cryptocurrency is a ecosystem in which transactions occur.  There are many aspects of this cryptocurrency technology which are being patented.  
They aren't patenting "Bitcoin", they are patenting aspects of the cryptocurrency environment which are much larger than bitcoin and will control all cryptocoins (ie bitcoin, litecoin, dogecoin, feathercoin).
Here is another good example from Gemalto.  The word "bitcoin" is not in the patent but it doesn't need to be.  The application covers a technological aspects of "electronic coins" (ie Bitcoin, Litecoin, dogecoin,etc).
 
Here is another from NTT.  Again doesn't use the word bitcoin but nevertheless may cover aspects of bitcoin technology.
