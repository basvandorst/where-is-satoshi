There’s a microscopic amount of work to store the blockchain data and interchange it with others. But that effort is extremely trivial compared to mining. It’s like making a grocery list but running a marathon between writing each item to the list. It’s part of the rules that you created for the task, but isn’t an efficient way to plan your grocery trip.

Where you’re getting lost, and it’s understandable because it’s irrational, is that the work being done isn’t productive. Mining has an arbitrary difficulty level that can be changed. It’s like playing a video game on different difficulty settings. More challenge means that you’ll beat less levels per hour. But you can choose to lower the difficulty if you wanted to increase your “productivity” in that scenario.

It's a little bit of both. Think of if like this. There's a math problem where the output is a string of characters. There's no way to predict which input will yield a certain output. Say the difficulty is level is based around how many zeroes that the output needs to start with. At current difficulty, the network will only accept an answer that starts with 10 zeroes. Your input can be quickly checked but it takes a lot of guessing to find an input that works. You're rewarded for finding a valid input and the input is what the network needs to verify a transaction. The difficulty adjustment would be, instead of 10 zeroes in a row, that now we'll accept 9 zeroes. It takes less guesses to do that - and less work.
