Okay, there isn't anything I can do except wait anyway.
@_date: 2015-06-30 19:12:52
I am using blockchain, but this transaction is coming from satoshimines.com
@_date: 2015-06-10 22:44:50
Because I love you with all my heart, I just need a friend.
@_date: 2015-06-30 18:11:15
I am getting so confused xD
@_date: 2015-06-30 19:26:22

@_date: 2015-06-30 17:46:36

I gave you gold for this post, enjoy.
@_date: 2015-06-30 18:05:27
What do you mean? How can I send it again
@_date: 2015-06-30 18:51:22
So I just have to wait?
@_date: 2015-06-30 18:15:23
It was money satoshimines paid out, so not sure.
I am waiting for this to confirm so then I can withdraw the money I have left in satoshimines. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 18:07:56
It was btc that somebody was sending me
@_date: 2015-06-30 18:14:25
I have done that, will wait for it I guess
@_date: 2015-06-30 18:51:07
Thanks, lets see if this works
@_date: 2015-06-11 00:38:29
Bought you Reddit gold again, feeling happy today :)
@_date: 2015-06-30 17:35:38
It's been 6 hours now, it never takes this long.
@_date: 2015-06-30 17:54:49
So what should I do? Kinda new to BTC
@_date: 2015-06-30 18:20:51
I guess that's good for me. It's just going to take longer to confirm because of the people 'stress testing' and my low fees.
@_date: 2015-08-25 18:19:51
localbitcoins.com you can buy using bank transfer, and in some cases paypal
@_date: 2015-09-12 13:26:36
It's because they are being DDoSed
@_date: 2015-10-19 21:02:29
You're an idiot.
