Where would you buy the s3 from?
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:34:45

How much would an antminer pull in?
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:25:19
Damn appreciate the help anyways!
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:38:45
I was looking for a s3 because I heard they are cheap and power isn't a problem for me
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:20:04

@_date: 2017-11-13 16:18:46
I decided I'm gonna buy an s7
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:44:00

@_date: 2017-11-13 22:49:45

It's better than mining $60 a month on my gpu
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:22:04
400 after fees and everything
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:30:17

@_date: 2017-11-14 03:01:25

@_date: 2017-11-13 23:02:33
Some guy on Reddit sold me one through open bazaar I think it's called
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:01:23
it says i earn like $2 a day
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:48:52
I mean, I didn't have the 1300 to spend on an s9 but I had $400 to spend on this one which is still relevant
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:26:17
i was told it was $9 after elect its about $5.50
