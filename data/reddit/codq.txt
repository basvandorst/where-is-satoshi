Is GDAX as safe as Coinbase for storing your coins, at least in the short term?
I don't see a place on the GDAX interface which lists how much my altcoins are worth, which is one of the most fun things to watch on Coinbase.  Am I missing something?
GDAX is clearly better (and cheaper) for buying, selling, and transfering, but Coinbase is much nicer for HODLing and watching!

Is there an easy way to transfer from Coinbase to GDAX? There also doesn't seem to be a mobile app for buying and trading through GDAX, unless I'm missing something (which I know I am)?
I really like the simplicity of the Coinbase experience, but clearly it's stupid to pay those fees if it's not necessary.

Thanks for the info!
I don't see my Coinbase balance on GDAX, so I might have to dig a little deeper into that.
I'll definitely look into Electrum / Hardware Wallet soon, thanks!  Also, these 4-8 day waiting periods are killing me.
EDIT: Just found [this help sheet for transferring Coinbase &gt; GDAX](  Just because I don't want to screw anything up and the terminology is a bit confusing, should I 'deposit' or 'withdraw', to put Coinbase funds into GDAX?

Yep, thanks!  I'll deposit my balance to GDAX, then move to Wallet once I'm ready to sit.

Sure, but growth seems to be stalling.

You fool.
I, too, am fool.

ETH is down over the past 24h.

Ethereum hasn't been performing well this week, is this a result of the big BTC rally?

I see that I my account works on both!  
But do they share exchange wallets?  My Coinbase balance doesn't appear on GDAX, so I'm wondering if I need to manually combine the two, or move my Coinbase funds over.
