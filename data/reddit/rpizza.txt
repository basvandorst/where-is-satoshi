Dont we need an adress to mail said purchases ir get an email confirmation anyway?
@_date: 2015-07-17 22:08:39
People have a right to ask that question when they want to entrust their money. Some people do care even if u dont. Money is a very intimate thing and people have different intimate relationships and bonds to their money
@_date: 2015-07-17 00:11:00
Yay for internet magic money. tnx!  Do u use it often?
@_date: 2015-07-17 03:39:19
I really wish i could grasp that

They read , go to lots of museums (we live right outside nyc). Immerse ourselves in different cultures. Go to plays   I disenrolled them from school for a month and spent a month in peru (i "homeschooled" fhem). We have spent several month exploring europe over the last few years etc...
@_date: 2015-07-16 20:51:46
No worries. I like seeig enthusiasm in people. 
@_date: 2015-07-16 20:57:30
Well when your broil there is fire over it.  Gas stove has a pan between the fire and food. I bbq too. And all that IS ACTUAL FIRE Silly!  
I am a city folk girl. Cars r okay if there isnt mass transit. Cooking IS AMAZING, i eat in restaurants only that serve fresh amazing food that i cant cook and saving money (and spending it) is empowering. I save sooo much. But i have a home completely in my name no mortgage that i paid in full. College accounts full for my kids. I just spent a month in peru.  Spent last two years travelling w my kids trough europe  leaving for florida in a few weeks. I go to bars plays adventures often plus i save. Its a balance and i am sure as hell not depriving myself.

Inam in the middle of reading various links and articles and some videos.  I truely trying to grasp it in real world application and adoption. Tnx for these links. 
@_date: 2015-07-16 23:01:54
That is how i am viewing it right now. Not for serious money. It does have the essence and feel of penny stocks (much more abstract in bitcoins) i dont gamble on my hard earned money and look at low to mostly modest investing.  I do dable in some real estate here and there i just sold a property the other day and made $60,000 profit. 2 nd home i sold in last 10 years. It s not a full time thing though. I am in my early 30s and proud of what i have done thus far (not bad for a social worker lol). 
@_date: 2015-07-16 22:01:52
No one puts a gun to their head.  Plus its a lack of self control and common sense
@_date: 2015-07-19 13:57:36
ThAts comparing apples to oranges.  The internet is an amazinf thing.  But i am not putting my hard earned money in the internet    People have intimate relationship w their money.  Its like a kid to them. 
@_date: 2015-07-21 23:08:50
I heard thats a great way of keeping money out of hands so to speak while making drug transactions. Lol.  Not my thoe of business or scene. But if it were, damn what a great way to launder some money lol
@_date: 2015-07-16 22:22:03
No there was a program for a basic cell for homeless not a smartphone.  And u dont know life on the streets of nyc homeless. You have no idea. And yes homeless in america is different then homeless in poverty in peru or africa
@_date: 2015-07-16 13:29:05
I see. This is stuff i dont need or use
@_date: 2015-07-16 06:21:10
I was not old enough to do penny stocks but i remember them. This sorta reminds me of the concept of get rich quick with little invested. So i will treat it as such. Play around see what happens. 
@_date: 2015-07-19 07:32:58
Educating the masses with belittling comments toward people isnt helping your cause. How old are you? 16?
@_date: 2015-07-16 06:09:15
Is that a hope and a wish ir true projection?
@_date: 2015-07-17 01:01:36
Tnx.  Learning alot about bitcoins in reddit. Thank u kind sir!
@_date: 2015-07-16 06:59:16
Hey tnx for the cookie.  
I plan on investing even less. Its interesting to see where it goes!!! You guys have been great!
@_date: 2015-07-16 15:09:17
Does ITUNES accept it?
@_date: 2015-07-17 00:47:49
But how does one know how to figure out a scam?  When its a hard concept to grasp.  How does one know what is a scam and what isnt?
@_date: 2015-07-16 06:32:51
Life is scary. Money rules the world
@_date: 2015-07-19 07:40:45
I think this is why bitcoin wont work for the masses.....
@_date: 2015-07-16 21:18:00
So many bitcoin millionares are out there?
@_date: 2015-07-19 07:37:51
And so it begins. ..... 
@_date: 2015-07-17 12:01:28
Well said sir
@_date: 2015-07-16 21:59:13
Hey tnx !!! What a great way of teaching me how it works. Practice make perfect!
@_date: 2015-07-16 05:05:59
I have regular paychecks.  I have different retirement and saving setups. So this is more for businesses?
@_date: 2015-07-16 21:18:29
How many bitcoilm millionaires are out there
@_date: 2015-07-17 01:59:52
So the time is now.   Now or never. 
@_date: 2015-07-16 06:31:45
My money is insured and most of my money is in my house
@_date: 2015-07-16 05:23:46
Now it makes sense. 
@_date: 2015-07-16 23:42:19
I have to say i am pretry happy with my banks as well in the usa (i have several bank accounts). I also dont pay fees for domestic things and i use atm sparingly. I pay everything with my credit card but oay off the balance monthly.  
I am not tech savey and it does seem like a hassle. And the hacking scares me.  
@_date: 2015-07-16 05:42:39
Wow tnx. So very interesting and different
@_date: 2015-07-16 13:26:02
Do they really have insurance?  Its a new jdea in america to have insurance
@_date: 2015-07-16 21:00:09
I am a social worker by trade and heart. I have limited talent in economics. I do own my own home and cars no mortgage or loans and i am 30. I have college money saved up for kids etc. so i have takent in finances. 
@_date: 2015-07-16 04:55:24
Ummm not into buttcoins
@_date: 2015-07-16 23:52:54
How can i mitigate my risks?
@_date: 2015-07-17 21:47:12
Ooo if it takes off. They will. Mark my words on this date and time
@_date: 2015-07-16 21:16:23
So its only affecting people with over $1000k!??
@_date: 2015-07-16 20:48:49
They cant even get food. Let alone getting online. 
@_date: 2015-07-16 22:03:27
So under €100,000 people are safe?  
@_date: 2015-07-16 06:56:59
Tnx.  I understand this better now
@_date: 2015-07-16 06:21:59
Damn would you have gotten some bitcoins if u did??  
@_date: 2015-07-16 22:36:09
I have several times over that invested in moderate to low risk funds and some on hand. 
@_date: 2015-07-16 05:22:12
All this is done online 
@_date: 2015-07-16 06:37:50
I paid in full years ago. If it catches fire or ofher act of god its insured. 
@_date: 2015-07-16 22:50:32
Of course rhey woukd take their cut out of the home sale.   Taxes are a necesary evil. I pay for services like police, sewer, school ,trash, good roads, town pool. Thats life in america
Where i buy property i have no issues selling fast and easy (so far) just sold an investment property pretty quick the other day and made a profit of $60,000. The property i live on for last 8 years is in a desirable area of the usa market great school system. Safe and clean.  Tax in america as much as i hate it.  I think of it like a service. I could live in a 3 rd world country pay little to no tax and feel unsafe , its dirty ,pay for private school for my kids ro get a decent education etc
@_date: 2015-07-21 23:06:40
I understand that it wont fly but its being touted as the next big thing...
@_date: 2015-07-16 13:20:14
Somerkmes it took bundred of yeats fo maks it practical or needed. But i can see your poinf
@_date: 2015-07-16 23:45:04
But i am not tech savvy in a computer engineering sort of way . I am a mere social worker. I dont know how to mitigate bitcoin scams. I can barely grasp this bitcoin process now to mitigate it? I wouldnt know what is right or wrong. This is what scares people like me.  
@_date: 2015-07-16 06:17:35
Sounds promising. I am hesitant but slowly thinking of diversifying my money
@_date: 2015-07-16 05:19:39
So for me it would just be another investment.  And hope it grows. What does the market look like ?
@_date: 2015-07-16 22:33:26
We are basically trying to keep them sober clean fed   Idk how i can teach something that is so abstract. We are trying to just keep people alive
@_date: 2015-07-16 22:36:30
And i am in america. 
@_date: 2015-07-16 20:58:18
Get rich quick?  Not for the faint of heart
@_date: 2015-07-16 22:40:19
Usually those are super temporary and get out if that situation quick.  The majority are what I described.   I know. I am in the firld and deal with that population as part of what i do
@_date: 2015-07-16 21:20:48
That def cleared things up for me. So i can move up in reasearching like a big girl!
@_date: 2015-07-16 21:02:04
Tnks for clarification.  It makes sense how it may be the wave if the future. I will do some minor investing.  !!
@_date: 2015-07-16 13:22:06
I gotta be honest.  i am not excited.  
@_date: 2015-07-16 22:00:59
Damn it. I am not a market type of girl and i am having a difficult time grasping some points. But i do appreciate input to help me grasp it better
@_date: 2015-07-16 06:00:17
Sounds like a hobby. Or are people really making money?
@_date: 2015-07-17 02:02:25
Ahhhh. I did my research i know what fiat is   Yayyy go me
@_date: 2015-07-16 06:33:42
So like some side cash?
@_date: 2015-07-16 22:17:15
Well then i am down with that
@_date: 2015-07-16 05:21:26
To save a few bucks on fees. I can understand  i wire money to europe to rent out apartments once in a while. I lose a few bucks sure... But they wouldnt accept bitcoins...  I just chalk it as a  
@_date: 2015-07-19 13:58:38
Thats what scary
@_date: 2015-07-16 05:11:15
How do i get that?
@_date: 2015-07-16 06:15:32
Im a lady. I dont game. Although my husband just got me mortal kombat for ps4. My kids are on it alot and i can never get near it   I got a house. I work full time got small kids   Just need to apply this bitcoin to my life
@_date: 2015-07-16 05:40:18
Is there any insurance ?  Can i lose money ?  Since this is still experimental what happens if it goes bust?  Tnx for the info and links
@_date: 2015-07-16 13:34:43
Thats where i think i am heading
@_date: 2015-07-16 06:24:09
I am starting with like $50   Give it a whirl
@_date: 2015-07-16 14:04:58
Thats scary stuff.  
I think bery long term debt is the rooot of evil
@_date: 2015-07-17 23:59:37
One more time. 
@_date: 2015-07-16 23:13:24
I also notice most people use it on video games or small discounts in starbuck products or small discounts on amazon saving a few bucks here and there.  Although intereting, it doesnt move me to want to use it for coffee. Have u used it in a practical way?
@_date: 2015-07-16 21:03:20
Thats why i dont carry any long tern debt. I had very short tern debt 5 years and paid off my house etc.... 
@_date: 2015-07-18 11:24:07
And that is the other part. You understand the code because you are a techie prob. Most people arent      Its a different way of doing things in a manner they dont understand. Now everyone is arguing that non techies trust the current system wirhout knowing how it works is an invalid issue. This sucky system has been around for a long time and people have figured out how to adapt to it. Doesnt mean we think its the best way.  I gotta be honest it scary to blindly adapt something. And in this day in age as opposed to days of past we ask questions and try to figure it out. Where in this current money system it got "figured out" by general public and accepted along time ago and passed down. Its all we know.
 Then i see the posts about nodes and programs  and all the techie stuff and its like speaking alien to most people and its scares people (who are not computer sceince engineers). The concept is so abstract to people who know in this and age ask how it works but dont grasp it. Again the current system is ok for me (i have done well and i cant complain) i know its not an ideal system     I just wonder if world adoption is realistic in my lifetime or even my childrens lifetime.    And i get that the codes have changed since this guy invented it but to a normal person who is not a techie the secretive nature of the starter brings in a higher level if distrust to the general population that doesnt understand this abstract system.  
@_date: 2015-07-21 23:39:08
Thats my greatest hope!
@_date: 2015-07-16 13:32:55
I was a kid and wr had internet. I sm not politocal nor technical. I hate high risk. But i am gonna play around in it
@_date: 2015-07-16 07:01:02
Thats why i am researching it. Tnx
@_date: 2015-07-21 23:38:05
Bookmarked it.  Tnx
@_date: 2015-07-21 23:07:41
So investing it is a better option?   Thats what i am trying to figure out. How to use it in its best possible way
@_date: 2015-07-16 06:13:03
Must find wallet... Where would my wallet be?
@_date: 2015-07-19 07:40:16
Customer service bro
@_date: 2015-07-16 21:38:02
I dont see a bitcoin option on amazon. I just tried  how do i do that
@_date: 2015-07-19 07:41:16
But thays your job
@_date: 2015-07-16 14:03:36
Silly i use fire several times a day. It is needed so i can cook or grill or bake. Its modern fire. I start it myself. 
@_date: 2015-07-21 21:49:49
Cool i will check out those. But i gotta be honest those are small potatoes. If i decided to add $1000 more  talking about bigger things
@_date: 2015-07-16 05:58:37
Ahhh so for me i can possible use it to diversify my money. Put a little bit into bitcoins not everything. I know i am insured up to $100,000 in a bank per account. So i know thats safe. I own a home outright And i have insurance on it god forbid theres a fire.   So bitcoin sounds a little risky. Reminds me of penny stocks of the 90s.  
@_date: 2015-07-16 06:34:19
Tnx for clarification
@_date: 2015-07-16 06:24:55
Whats VC?
@_date: 2015-07-17 00:20:58
My understanding the issue in greece is accounts over €100,000 not under. 
@_date: 2015-07-22 12:06:51
This is by far the beat advise that fit my needs. Tnks!
@_date: 2015-07-17 02:00:42

But did they really habe insurance
@_date: 2015-07-17 22:07:08
Well the wheel inventer is from along time ago. This inventor is among us and his secrarive nature is alarming to some. We cant go back in time to talk to the inventor of the wheel. 
@_date: 2015-07-19 14:04:07
With your thoughts this further discounts in jobs it will discourage even more people from adopting bitcoins.  Bitcoins is so abstract to begin with. Now ur comment add more to the abstraction
Because people have been " working" in one way shale or form from the beginning of time. To support feed clothe themselves and their family. I have 2 small kids. How i am supposed to make sure they survive without a means of support
@_date: 2015-07-16 06:18:38
Ok i got coinbase. Its a start 
@_date: 2015-07-16 21:08:39
If my house is paid in full and i am not paying my taxes i could always sell my house and get $400,000 cash. Live off that and its interest

You know that america or other countries will want a cut of the action and will find a way to regulate it.  Mark my words. 
@_date: 2015-07-16 05:54:27
I know that everything is a risk. But when dealing with high numbers one tends to invest moderately
@_date: 2015-07-16 07:00:19
Abhhhh. So for some ifs a great source of income
@_date: 2015-07-17 12:54:19
Is everything a scam with bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-07-16 13:37:42
Interesting link. Insee greece was insured. 
@_date: 2015-07-21 21:47:00
I am just trying to use it in an earth shattering way. To see why its so great.  I pay my CC in full each month and never carry aa balance
@_date: 2015-07-16 06:25:42
Im gonna hold on tight
@_date: 2015-07-21 21:43:08
Do i get a discount?  Cant i Just use my credit card?
@_date: 2015-07-16 22:25:20

Someone said its on amazon and i tried to buy something on amazon with my bitcoin and i couldnt find it as a payment method.  
@_date: 2015-07-17 01:58:25
I wonder if we will see worldwide adoption of it in our lifetime
@_date: 2015-07-16 07:02:31
I see there is limited use of it.  But some good ideas. Tnx
@_date: 2015-07-16 06:57:50

Tnx. I will check it out in a few hours.  All of you have been amazing and informative
@_date: 2015-07-19 07:42:40
If undont mainstream it and continue with the tech savy people belittle non techis it will NEVER be adopted
@_date: 2015-07-16 07:04:30
It sounds scary to a non computer egineer. But i am keeping my eyes wide open here

But most homless are not well versed in this. Damn i am barely grasping this.  It seems somewhat abstract to some people
@_date: 2015-07-16 06:45:13
Its def not liquid as money is. But its close enouh 
@_date: 2015-07-16 22:44:57
Thats the idea i am starting to form in my mind with all the great redditers giving links and explanations and videos. I believe i will slowly invest a few $ a paycheck for investment reasons. I also got a few change tips here which is a cool way and real life lesson on how things work    A few days ago i coukd care less. Today i have like $2 worth.  
I might use it as a novel way of buying a small item. 
Just to practice but be very cautious with it. 
@_date: 2015-07-16 21:14:01
So how much is out there now?
@_date: 2015-07-17 21:51:11
I gotta say i just got a few bucks but it peaked my interest and its like a hands on lesson. So i am thankful
@_date: 2015-07-16 21:07:22
But i feel its also many people fault for going into so much debt. People act and live wayyyy beyond their means. Its such a huge issue 
@_date: 2015-07-16 21:24:26

My home is an asset. Its paid in full there is $400,000 if i would sell it tomorroe and thats money in my bank if i sell it. That being said houses are insured if there was a fire or natural disaster and if the house burn to the ground, i get $400,000 in my pocket
@_date: 2015-07-16 06:29:31
Thays what i am seeing from all these posts. Idk why the person i was having a convo with was selling it like it was the second coming of jesus or something and that i was an idiot for being hesitant   I have way too much assests to just throw money into something new and scary. If she woulda have explained it like everyone on here has (so very nicely and helpful) i wouldnt feel like a dumbass
@_date: 2015-09-21 02:33:17
But for an average person (honestly) everything looks "fishy" with bitcoin
@_date: 2015-09-03 12:19:33
