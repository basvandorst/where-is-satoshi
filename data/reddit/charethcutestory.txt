What are you selling to, how do you actually intend to cash out into a bank account.  How do you manage to day trade in and out of USD without capping your sell limits on exchanges like Coinbase?

However, coinbase has withdrawal limits if I understand right.  If you're not classified with them as a high-net worth individual your highest limit is probably $15,000.
So if you want to pull out any amount of serious dough you might want some other options.  One that I have seen is localbitcoins, you can just go and dump as much coin as someone is willing to buy either locally or through a bank transaction.

What is your solution to liquidity, or otherwise said, what's your solution for the average investor in the US.
My understanding is that most people's withdrawal/sell limit is $15k on coinbase, unless they've applied to be a HNW individual (I've applied, but of course the wait is at least days).
It seems like my options for exiting crypto (even for a short while to avoid profit taking or something) is either hitting my withdrawal limit and being stuck for anything extra, or trading in USD Tether.  The latter option being somewhat intimidating to the average investor, as some quick research will return conversations mentioning fraud and money printing, although the idea sounds very cool to me.

Can I ask what your approach to liquidating your coins is?  That is the only part of my long term plan that I'm a little hazy on.  If the average user has a coinbase account with a 15k withdrawal limit, what do you do about cashing out a large sum all at once.  Getting High Net-Worth Individual status with Coinbase understandably takes a long time right now.

But that's still the high-net-worth validation process right?

The problem I've noticed with my alts is that you still (for the vast majority of people) have to convert them back into bitcoin at some point.  So in a way all altcoins that aren't readily convertable into fiat are riding on the backs of the btc value.

Well executed too, clean cut.

Just like bitcoin is inherently worth the value people ascribe to it, if people as a whole value the bank's credit that they are "good for" the bitcoin, you're right back where you started with the dollar.

If you zoom out enough, nations are like banks and have bank specific dollars.  I suspect that when Bitcoin becomes huge, something very similar to what you describe will be the norm.  Banks will have their own currency based on the bitcoin, and will trade just like foreign currency exchange, with their value being the people's confidence in that bank's solvency.
Right now the value of a nations currency (in theory) is based on the supply and demand of its goods in relation to other nations.  If bitcoin becomes the new "gold standard", the value of this bank-specific-currency can be based on ... what - the efficiency between its lendable capital and their ability to maintain solvency relative to its competitors?

I would take a gold iou over gold if you promised me additional gold in the future.

Why not

Remember that a bank is just a convenient and (presumably) secure place to store your money and hold the opportunity to gain interest.
Your impression of corruption and greed in banking is not based on the US Dollar but rather the nature of aggregate systems.  Unspent money can and should be used.  Eventually entire industries bank on the concept that every unused cent is being utilized and additional industries (insurance) rest on the solvency of those industries.
As more and more of the entire global economy depends on this phenomenon, the impetus for greed and corruption motivate peoples actions with the agenda of preserving the marketplace (or at least their little corner of it).
By the time people realize that they've built an upside down pyramid totally reliant on the correct estimation of available money, greed and corruption are standard and routine practice (after all that's what got us here to this pinnacle of economic civilization).

A credit balance on screen is enough guarantee if enough people believe it.  Recall that not too long ago merchants/businesses required "proof" in the form of a limited supply of a piece of paper which in turn was just a credit for a stock of gold bars in a vault somewhere.

Thanks for the break down.
As a relative novice, I have all my coin in coinbase.
The part where says I need to have my own private keys to get the same amount in the new fork, does that imply that I have to have it in a hard wallet as opposed to stored on the exchange?
Is this similar to a stock split, or what is the tangible effect of this hard fork.  From reading just that post it sounds like you get double your coins but that sounds ridiculous to me.  Sorry for the stupid questions.

In theory, yes.  But in theory, there is a set amount of gold, or goods, or commodities in the world that, with perfect information, can be audited.  Yes, it's easier to audit the quantity of bitcoin with math and blockchains than it is to take a global census, but if you can obfuscate one you can obfuscate the other.
We live in this safety bubble that "there's only so much bitcoin, ever", but once you compound and leverage with interest and collateral and that becomes the new foundation of economy, that "true quantity" gets lost just as easily.
