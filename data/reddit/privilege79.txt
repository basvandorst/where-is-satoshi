@_date: 2018-01-27 18:14:43
Sit back, relax and see what happends..
@_date: 2018-01-31 21:39:34
Lol...My thoughts exactly
@_date: 2018-01-26 14:31:13
I dont.
@_date: 2018-01-26 17:35:03
But nicely done

Lets see how things turn out...anyway I Hodl. But i think we are far away from 50k
@_date: 2018-05-24 18:54:47
I think yes, im wondering also if this is the reason why a lot of coins are in the green again at the moment
@_date: 2018-03-18 22:42:56
@_date: 2018-03-08 19:23:34
I think it looks better than before
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:16:17
bought at 12k...so no gaining here at the moment.
@_date: 2018-02-15 18:47:48
But parly untrue, at least the 2018 on the coin was maybe a little bit photoshoped
@_date: 2018-02-06 10:34:24
I know, but on the other hand when its going up im holding on to long till its going downwards again.
@_date: 2018-02-06 07:29:48
than i lost so much than i can offer to lose that last 1500 also. But i hope it will not happen but the thinking about it makes me nervous too...nobody likes to lose money.
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:42:10
Im in the red also. But keep it as it makes no sense to sell now
@_date: 2018-02-03 12:20:53
@_date: 2018-03-08 19:48:00
Maybe not the time for sarcasm...but now its supports bcc its a shitty and dangerous wallet
@_date: 2018-02-17 12:17:40
Still pretty cool
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:43:05
It still is... ;) 
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:57:45
Don't think so...its going down quickly right now. 12k is far away
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:56:18
one expensive slide also...and it doesn't look like it will be much more fun 
@_date: 2018-02-09 20:00:52
When im correct yesterday it peaked at 8.7 but was more between 8k and 8,5k during the whole day. Today its climbing in the last couple of hours to 8,6 / 8,7
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:39:10
Bought around 12k...
