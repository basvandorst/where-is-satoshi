Wire funds to gdax instead of using ACH, get access to it in hours instead of days.

This applies to any brokerage account.

It's speculation, not investment.

Nobody has seriously recommended that, there is even a psa pinned which states the contrary.

Anything like this available in the US?

If you sell at a loss you don’t pay tax on that.

Agreed, love my Nano S and the security is better then any mobile wallet.

If you wire, it yes, if you use ACH, no.

Oh I was just about to say the same about the Republicans increasing military spending to fight foreign wars. Guess both sides have their hands in your pockets for various reasons.

I was able to open and fund my gdax account in one business day via bank wire. At first I was outraged that gdax didn't allow me to upload a scan of my ID because taking a good picture of your ID with a webcam is impossible. But after I downloaded the Coinbase app on my phone it was smooth sailing, I got verified within a few hours. 
I know that I'm in the US and didn't try to use a credit card but overall my experience buying btc as someone who's never traded before on an exchange was pretty positive.

It's worth noting that they aren't in all 50 states yet, for example, mine. Unlike Coinbase.

Just curious, does anyone sell HDDs preloaded with the blockchain? Is it even possible? Given the crappy quality of residential internet in my area it would be much more cost effective this way to set up a full node.

I was able to wire money (over your stated amount) in a day to my gdax account. If your bank allows it and time is important you can spend a little to wire the money if your account with coinbase is already verified, which by your account it sounds like it is.
