Whether the wallet is encrypted or not has nothing to do with the private key(s). 
The Bitcoin-Qt automatically has the private keys for each address you generate within it. And the wallet containing them should be encrypted, because otherwise everybody with access to your PC would be able to read it and thus gain control over your balance(s).

Who found him guilty of that?
Also, in the first line is Mt Gox as a company, with him being CEO. So first a theft needs to be proven, and then one can investigate whether he is related to that and punishable in any form.
Innocent until proven otherwise, anyone?
I'm not denying that something happened here, but how about first researching what happened and by whom it was done before putting people into jail?

Thanks. I found this on how Japan differs to other countries that have mandatory prosecution:
It seems to be the prosecutor's discretion to push charges.

Libertarians age not a homogenic (?) group... some want no government at all, others want a minimal government,...
Also they differ in the kind of government (do we have dedicated politicians, or "ordinary men" elected for a fixed amount of time, direct votes or parties, ...).

My understanding of legal proceedings is that first someone has to sue them, which then triggers an investigation. My understanding is also, that the class action lawsuits being prepared are just that: Still being prepared. Also, I expect international lawsuits to take longer.
EDIT: Seems that I am wrong, see my message above

I think the OPs main point was anonymity, which is not given when doing the exchange via bitcoin.de (Even though I'm also a bitcoin.de user and can only recommend them to anyone in a sepa country)

In bitcoin-qt, you can choose the unit in which your balance etc. is displayed.

Make sure you read up on the topic of "change addresses" when handling paper wallets. My recommendation is to use Bitcoin Armory, it creates Wallets (+ Paper wallets) where you don't have to worry about change addresses, and also you can use an offline PC for offline transactions, which is much easier to handle than paper wallets for doing transactions.

I know the feeling. I was debating with me on whether I should add a "&lt;/sarcastic&gt;" tag to it, but thought I'd go more for the subtle approach. On hindsight, and considering how many people go for the "I have nothing to hide, let them spy on me" approach, some people could very well say what I said and actually mean it :-(

I rather doubt this scenario - a cut-off part as small as Ukraine would not have enough hash power to maintain a decent block rate at current diff.
They could only hope to have someone bridge via other means (assuming "their" internet by itself is intact).

"if i owned bitcoins could the exchange steal them in some way?"
The moment you hand your bitcoins over to an exchange you stop owning them - they are no longer under your control.
The same as when you deposit money with your bank - you are at their mercy of them handing them back to you when you request them to do so.

A change address is only used when you _spend_, and also when you don't spend everything from the transaction used as input for the outgoing transaction (take fees into account).
Best way to avoid problems is imo if you create a paper wallet with Bitcoin Armory - you have one "base address" that all others get derived from, so no worries about change addresses etc. You can also import traditional paper wallets into Armory and sweep them clean, i.e. the change goes into an address within the existing Armory wallet.

You can create a wallet with Armory, and it also offers the possibility to create a "watching only" wallet, which you can then load into your windows installation. It does not include the private key, so it is safe to use, and you can still monitor all the balances with it. You would have this armory installation connected to the net and then use it to create offline transactions that you can then sign in the offline installation under ubuntu. This would be necessary if you want to use the ubuntu-armory in offline mode, because it itself would not know your balance, only the online one on windows would have this knowledge.
Sounds reasonably secure to me. If you wanted to step up security and user-friendliness, you'd use a dedicated old computer for the ubuntu installation, so that you can create&amp;sign offline transactions without having to do all the rebooting.
And don't forget to print out a paper wallet with armory (it suggests doing this by itself when you create a wallet).

Hm, does there need to be a law explicitly defining the status of each thing? For example, theft is punishable, but you don't need a specific law for the theft of an apple, or another one for the theft or a computer, or one for the theft of a brickstone.
I would assume that everything you can own is an asset, the way all inventory of a supermarket (apples to sausages to ...) is part of the supermarkets assets.

But....you could plan to finance terrorism with it, or money laundering. I find it very suspicious that you seem to have a problem disclosing it - if you planned on using it for legal stuff, why would you have a problem with that?
@_date: 2014-03-07 13:06:00
Having an unregulated, global, electronic, new financial instrument has nothing to do with a legal framework that allows you to investigate a possible theft.

Not sure if it will in effect work out as classic economists have been teaching us the exact opposite, but their may be an agenda behind teaching us this point of view.
A "saving society" may yield a world where people first think whether they really need something before buying it, it may end stuff like fashion trends or whatever companies want to tell us we need and lead us into a need-based society, away from having to reach exponential growth to just producing what is actually needed.
Whether it will work out? Well, there are always TPTB that will try to push their agenda, and as long as only few people realize this, TPTB may still keep the upper hand...

Yes, that clears it up a bit and we seem on mostly common ground.

Well, the cheapest way to acquire goxbtc would certainly be bitcoin builder. Since they don't actually need real BTC, but only need to buy the GOXBTC off the existing users to become solvent again, buying them at (currently) 0.1btc per goxbtc sounds like the much better deal than buying them on the free markets.

Since difficulty is only adjusted every 2016 blocks, a sudden drop in hash power by e.g. 90% would indeed cause serious problems - the next diff adjustment would be some 20 weeks from then (assuming the drop was shortly after the previous diff adjustment). During that time, the average block time would be 100 minutes.
Actually, that I think that was one of the better informed articles - the only notion I don't agree with is them stating that miners would turn off their nodes, whereas nodes (that store and forward blocks) are not necessarily used for mining - only some are.

In order to investigate a theft, first someone needs to sue.
Also, it's not the government's job to investigate, this is a job for a court.

In the past weeks I frequently saw blockchain seemingly "freeze up" for a while (I read something about overlarge blocks since they supposedly seem to have a problem with that).
So perhaps it had already gone through, you just couldn't see it.
You not being able to see the unconfirmed transaction either seems to support this theory.
@_date: 2014-02-28 15:21:11
I fully agree with you on those theories. I have been a lover of human &amp; constitutional rights, but since learnt that those are just nice stories.

Virtual items in a game or virtual currency in a game is limited to that game. The game goes offline, everything you had is gone.
Bitcoin is decentralized/peer-to-peer, meaning it does not depend on any single website, server, ... being online; you can use them wherever Bitcoin is accepted.

I'd go for training five of them and give them code snippets that are good for a 3-out-of-5 (multi-signature) approach, and keep them at different locations. This copes for losses due to theft or death.

With Bitcoin being dependant on a global internet, I guess it's the worst store of value in a World War scenario. And I'm not even talking EMP here.

Hm, ok... well, if banks would not finance governments to destabilize (euphenism for warfare) other countries to the point that part of their population turns to terrorism ...
Anyway, I don't see Bitcoin as medium of choice there, and even if it will turn out to be, I still think it's easier to track than cash.
I myself consider governments (not banks, but aided by them) a bigger threat towards the population as a whole, although I'm not keen on being attacked by a mob, either - but I don't see that mob as being linked to Bitcoin in this context...
@_date: 2015-01-13 17:22:02
I think you are overlooking a thing. When price crashes fast enough so that a majority of miners turns off their equipment, there will be barely any blocks coming in and we may never reach the next difficulty adjustment.
The only thing that can save us then would be an emergency patch to change bitcoin for having difficulty adjustments much sooner.
For example with german electricity prices and current exchange rates, my mining gear only makes 20% in BTC of what I pay for electricity, so it's only a hobby right now...
@_date: 2015-01-13 17:30:26
At the current speed at which the price declines, we may not be long away from that. I'm surprised so many people only consider a slow decline of hashrate... Why would big mining corporations continue when it's cheaper to buy bitcoins than to mine them?
