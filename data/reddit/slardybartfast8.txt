Again, it’s been a month. If you expected to get rich in a month you were misled. It’s not a get rich quick scheme. You should buy with the intention to hold for at least a year. It will go over whatever you bought at again. Trust me. It will. Way over. But being butthurt because it didn’t happen immediately is not a great attitude to have towards an investment.

Sounds to me like there are vulnerabilities that make stealing data and passwords from affected computers, so in that sense it’s definitely possible if you keep your coins on an exchange or online wallet a hacker could target your passwords and steal your shit. Trezor already announced anyone using it is safe, no vulnerabilities. I assume Ledger is the same. So if using a hardware wallet sounds like is the safest way (who didn’t know that?)

@_date: 2019-07-02 18:25:56
Better for what purpose?  Unless you are trying to day trade a dedicated wallet that you own the keys to is the best. Electrum is a good free option but if you have enough BTC that losing it would have serious implications on your financial health I’d buy a hardware wallet. Trezor or Nano Ledger. Keeping it on an exchange is risky, imo. Too many scenarios where you lose access. Not your keys? Not really your coin.  If it’s only that $130 though and you don’t plan on adding to it? I wouldn’t worry about it honestly. It’s certainly not worth buying a trezor and the fees for moving it to electrum will annoy you.

Question doesn’t make a lot of sense. Halving will effect supply and price. How would it “effect” an exchange, outside of the price to buy changing?

have you tried literally googling your question?  smh
@_date: 2019-07-05 15:22:13
As the rest are easily google-able and easy to understand, I'll just do the halvening.
Every day miners around the world compete to mine blocks for a reward of 12.5 bitcoins per block. Around 144 blocks are mined each day (I think). So that’s 1,800 *new* BTC hitting the market every day. When the halvening happens, as it has before as they are scheduled events set to happen when we cross certain overall block numbers, that reward is cut in half from 12.5 to 6.25. Before the last halvening the reward was 25BTC per block.  Theoretically, given that demand should remain the same, as daily supply is suddenly cut in half price should be squeezed upward. Basically there will be a drought of new BTC (900 per day instead of 1,800) on the market suddenly, and if all other factors besides that remain constant, the restricted supply affects price advantageously.
@_date: 2019-07-07 13:38:31
Also wait a second. Your question was “why would anyone invest now” given what I said. I literally answered that. Investing $400 now to get return value near $18k is a reason. It’s just not going to get him rich the way he was asking.  If that doesn’t answer your initial question then you aren’t posing it right.
@_date: 2019-07-22 19:19:46
I wish I could understand the people who say 19% of the worlds population has bought crypto. I simply can’t reconcile this in my head with the fact that the largest US exchange only 30million users and there aren’t even 40 million wallets on the blockchain. I know that’s only bitcoin, not all crypto, but it still doesn’t make sense. The market of BTC eclipses everything else so how could 1.5 billion people have bought crypto?  I don’t understand what that study is talking about.

Noticed something today. Normally I just google the word “bitcoin” and the first thing it shows on google is a price ticker, right at the top. No need to scroll down at all. It was price, then news, then twitter, etc. Normal. But as of today the first things are three ads, bitcoinIRA, Coinbase, and Gemini. Never had them show up before. Wondering if google just decided to capitalize on people googling Bitcoin and hit them with advertising sooner, or if these are new buys. Either way it seems bullish to me
@_date: 2019-07-07 13:13:31
He wasn’t asking anything about it becoming a future currency. He was asking if he could get rich in a few years.  Either way, second-layer solutions will lead to bitcoin becoming useful as a currency. Most believe BTCs use is more as a store of value while other coins act as actual currency. I don’t pretend to know. All I know is I’ve made more money buying and holding bitcoin than anything else I’ve ever invested in. And if you learn about the tech there are plenty of reasons to believe the value will go up from here. Whether you should spend your sats now or hold longer is a personal decision. I only answered whether this guy can provide for his love interest in a few years if he invests a few hundred dollars now. The answer to that is a resounding no.   
Anyways you act like getting a 18,000 bucks out by investing $400 now isn’t good. It’s fucking amazing. It’s just not enough to buy your girlfriend a mansion. Or even a nice car really.

I don’t see how my answer to the guys previous question relates to your question at all. I answered it as best I could. I’m not an expert. There are solutions being developed to use it as a currency. Others believe it’s better as a store of value. Investing now and seeing a massive return over the next few years is a good reason to invest?  I only said investing 400 isn’t going to make you set for life?  If you don’t like my answer try google, dipshit.

Since that 14k peak the market has tried to push below 10k 6 or 7 times and failed each time. Got to $9,980 for a minute or two before getting gobbled back up last time. Really interested to see if the market keeps rejecting sub 10k or if they eventually make it happen.

Dont forget about the multitudes who were so sure it would cross 10k and crash back down to 9, when instead it blasted through 10k up to 11k in less than an hour. All those people got fucking wrecked and they were *so sure* they knew what would happen. Trading is stupid.

Today’s price action is like a perfect microcosm of what it’s like to own bitcoin. Absolute chaos, no apparent rhyme or reason, fears of crashing under 10k followed swiftly by hopes of mooning as soon as we cross 10.5k. I laugh, I cry, I fret, I curse, I hope.  But more than all?  I HODL.

My only "endgame" is somewhere in the 60-80k range I'll sell half of one of my BTC, which would cover my initial investment plus about 800%.  After that, the 1+ BTC leftover (not willing to divulge more than that lol) will not be sold.  Period.  It will sit there until its worth next to nothing or until it makes sense to buy stuff with it.

Buying $400 worth at $11,200 per bitcoin will be worth just under $18,000 if bitcoin ever hits $500,000 per bitcoin. If things get really crazy and it ever hits $1million, you’d have $36000 dollars.

This man asked if I invest a few hundred dollars will it pay off enough to support my girl?  I said no. You said why would anyone not invested right now invest?  I said because if you put in $400 now it could be worth $18,000 dollars. Is that not a good reason?  If you want technical analysis on why, I said I don’t know. I said I don’t know multiple times, and gave the possibilities as I understand them. Explain to me, given these facts, how you are not a dip shit?  Investing $400 right now is great idea. Just not a great idea if your goal is to be set for life. Please answer this in a realistic way. I was trying to answer and you turned into a full on dickhead, dropping downvoted on my attempts at answers. Like a little bitch. If you want technical answers there are people out there who know better than me. I never pretended to know. Why did you ask me and then rail against my answer?  I have no idea.

It’s not an opinion. There are about 40 million active bitcoin wallets. Gotta assume some of those are one person owning multiple wallets.  The market size and numbers of users on every other coin combined doesn’t match BTCs. So how could 1.3 BILLION people have bought crypto?  Probably aren’t even 100 million active crypto wallets. I’m not a math whiz but those numbers don’t make any sense at all.

19% is such a bunch of bullshit lol
if 19% of people worldwide have bought bitcoin there should be something like 1.5 billion active wallets/addresses. There are less than 40 million last I checked.

You don’t actually buy bitcoin on robinhood. You don’t own it. You can’t transfer it. All you can do is load money, “buy” bitcoin, and then “sell” it back for fiat when you want. It’s not terrible as far as investing goes but it is terrible as far as owning and controlling your own bitcoin goes.

It’s ok as long as you understand you are investing in a position against the BTC price. You are not actually buying BTC. You don’t own it. You can’t transfer it or spend it. All you can do is open a position, see where the price goes, and eventually close your position. It works to make some money if you bet right but if you want to actually get involved in owning and holding BTC....no

Also just to be clear I didn’t read username of who responded before, so I thought I was talking to someone else asking if my comment was homophobic. Didn’t realize it was you at that time. I also assumed your GayloRen name was a 15 year old edgelord who thought it was funny, I never ever assumed you were gay. Now that I know you are gay, I definitely have no problem with that. I don’t like you as a person. I imagine you’d be the type of person I wouldn’t get along with. But that’s not because you’re gay. It’s because you suck.

Last time I tried to google around for this sort of info it seemed clear there was no way to gather usable data. I think I saw there are like 35-40 Million wallets/users on the network now. But how many of those are multiple wallets of the same person?  Who knows. How many wallets have people lost the passwords and seeds to and now basically defunct?  No clue. You can be guaranteed the “average” bitcoin buyer doesn’t come close to a full coin though. I would love to see new research or source-able data on this but I haven’t been able to find anything myself.

When you transfer BTC from one place to another you pay a fee for the transaction to the miners that make the network function. Some places don’t let you set your fee, so it’s always very high. Not ideal but it does guarantee your transaction will move in the next few blocks. But the smarter way is to use electrum or something similar. For every transaction you can set your own fee. Electrum makes suggestions for fast, medium and slow to make it easy, but you can also just set whatever fee you want. If it’s too low your transaction might take hours or days though. With electrum you can do a “parent pays for child” move where you can adjust the fee if you notice it wasn’t high enough, rather than wait for it to be kicked back to you, who knows when. Parent pays for child is the most important feature besides owning your own keys, imo. Can be a real life saver. Let me know if any of that isn’t clear enough.

If you bought $10USD right now (let’s say it’s 14k flat) and in a few years, as we all hope, it actually manages to become 1BTC=1millionUSD that ten dollars  would be worth....about $700USD.  So no it won’t pay for college. It might buy a few books though. If you do 20 bucks, just double it. Appx. $1400. And that’s best case scenario. It’ll probably be something less than that. But who knows.

No when I said that I didn’t know you were gay.   But I think asking if my amusement at the irony of telling me to grow up while being called GayloRen (which I maintain is immature no matter who you are) was definitely pretty snowflake-y. To even make that jump after what I said (which has nothing homophobic in it. I laugh at your handle. That’s the comment) indicates you look for stuff to be offended by and you assume people are homophobic pretty quickly. You don’t know me, never will, but I am a deeply gay-friendly straight man.

The Halving:
Every day miners around the world compete to mine blocks for a reward of 12.5 bitcoins per block. Around 144 blocks are mined each day (I think). So that’s 1,800 *new* BTC hitting the market every day. When the halvening happens, as it has before as they are scheduled events set to happen when we cross certain overall block numbers, that reward is cut in half from 12.5 to 6.25. Before the last halvening the reward was 25BTC per block.  Theoretically, given that demand should remain the same, as daily supply is suddenly cut in half price should be squeezed upward. Basically there will be a drought of new BTC (900 per day instead of 1,800) on the market suddenly, and if all other factors besides that remain constant, the restricted supply affects price advantageously.  Typically though the price goes up months before in anticipation of the event. I can’t remember what happened immediately after the last halving but I recall the 5-6 month run up to it was exciting.

I know there are ways to push a higher fee but unfortunately I don’t the sites. Someone may answer. I can tell it will either eventually get picked up or it will get kicked back to your wallet. I don’t know how long it will take but one of those things will happen. I recently did a similar thing  a few days ago with a low fee and it took about 50 hours for it to go through. Your fee is lower so it may take longer but your coin is gonna be ok

Small amounts aren’t going to show much return, at least not for some time. Let’s say you put 100 dollars in at 19k per coin. If everything went just right and we actually hit 1 million per coin your hundred dollars would be worth about 5k. Not bad, but that’s a lot of factors and it’s not going to happen any time soon.

No. Like I said when a fork happens everyone keeps their original coin and gets an equal amount of the newly formed coin. But because you had your coin in an exchange that didn’t support the fork they...I don’t know really know if they withheld all the BCH or what, but when they decided to support BCH a few weeks ago they released it accordingly to everyone who had BTC in their wallet on aug 1. It is free money because now BCH is worth something suddenly. At the time it was worth nothing, so really you got lucky. Like I said sell it now because it’s a shitcoin and trade for more btc. Or just cash out.

Every exchange has slightly different prices at any given time. Your wallet may be pulling a market aggregate or it’s number from one specific place. It doesn’t matter tho, what matters is your coin amount. If you were going to sell, choose the exchange you like and keep track of the price there. Most people here track the price using the GDAX.com exchange depth chart. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:00:25

It doesn’t matter, the amount of coin you have is the same. If coinbase or some other exchange is showing higher then that’s what it would be worth if you transferred and sold so... who cares that the wallet is lagging behind or using a more conservative source for its value?  My trezor wallet is also usually a few hundred behind the average exchange rate. Don’t know why, not sure where they get their data. Doesn’t matter 
@_date: 2019-07-28 12:58:54
It already was right. It doesn’t say anything about the end of the month. It just says sometime this month it would go to 9,200 and it did and never went lower than like 9,150 or something on July 17. Nowhere does it say end of month

You guys remember when 13k was euphoric instead of a relief?  This game is fuckin crazy. I love it. I’ve said I’m holding until 500k or zero and that hasn’t changed this week. Never even considered selling. Although I wish I understood the rift between BTC and that other coin a little better, I definitely know I don’t want to be on roger vers side.

Don’t tell people how much you have. And so you are aware with that amount even if bitcoin did make it one million dollars per coin in a couple years it would be worth less than 2k. Not quite baller status. But welcome to the club 
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:16:22
Pretty sure fees are higher on most atms. It’ll say the fee is only like three dollars but the exchange rate it uses is going to way inflated. I think last time I used one btc was trading around 19,500 but buying the coin from the atm exchange rate was like 21,100 or something crazy. At the end day of the day it probably ends up being about the same I just like the atm sometimes because you can use cash. 
@_date: 2019-07-02 19:41:42
Re-reading that’s clearer but easy to see why that could be taken as wanting to move from “your” coin robinhood to somewhere else. Anyways I apologize. Plenty of exchanges out there. Coinbase or Gemini good bets. Use a desktop wallet like electrum that lets you own the keys and set your own fees. If you are going to accumulate a notable amount buy a trezor or a nano. Not much more to it than that.

I know that people are bummed we aren’t making new ATHs every other day but I just want to say I’m still way way up and being over 10k alone is a massive win. It’s also helped push my ripple and eth into significant profit too. Only one I’m a bit down on is litecoin. Considering selling at small loss to buy more ripple be not sure. Just seems like ltc has been dead for a few weeks now. 
@_date: 2019-07-02 14:00:07
It’s not like every person does the same thing the same way?  Some people feel secure leaving it in exchange, some don’t.  I’d guess people more prone to try and day-trade or have weak hands keep it in exchange for quick transactions. Hodlers don’t leave BTC on exchanges because it’s a bad idea long term.

There was a fork in August that created BCH. When that happens anyone holding BTC was entitled to an equal amount of bch. If you had your btc in coinbase they didn’t support bch until a few weeks ago. Thus you just now received the coin you were entitled to. Sell the bch and buy btc. But that’s just one mans opinion.

Probably not a good idea for a lot of reasons. If he has that much in bitcoin have him cash out and pay you and have him deal wth the taxes. Right now him giving you bitcoin is giving you a choice. Hold it (which means for a year st least you don’t have the money in your pocket) or sell immediately and deal with the taxes etc yourself. Either way you aren’t getting 11k. You’ll either get less, or maybe in a year have a lot more. But if you don’t know anything about bitcoin, setting up a wallet, where to buy/sell, what it is etc then you have no business accepting that offer anyway. You would fuck it up or get scammed and end up with nothing. If I were you I’d demand flat because he owed you in fiat. Like I said he can cash out, pay you, and pay the taxes himself that’s not your problem

The top post over there right now is a pretty open and honest letter from the CEO explaining the situation.

Somewhere no one will see it or touch it for ten years. Get a safety deposit box if possible, I don’t know. But that’s all you need to do.

Don’t tell them. At least not until you are 18. I don’t know your parents but the chances of them trying to seize control of those funds will be high unfortunately.  Or guilt trip you. If you were planning on cashing out and you really trusted your dad I would advise getting advice for tax purposes etc, but if you are planning to hold just shit your damn mouth.  When you’re 18 you can do what you want,  but it would be a mistake to tell them now. I just can’t see the upside. Money makes people crazy, and if you think that your 50k is more money than your parents have in their bank accounts, shut the fuck up. It’s your money. You were smart and saw potential. Do you think they would’ve given you a few hundred of their money to invest in btc a few years ago?  I don’t.

If you put in $1000USD right now at a price point of $16,000BTC and everything continues to go our way for a year or two, you could conceivably finish with 50-60k (that’s if bitcoin approaches or reaches 1millionUSD per coin).

Im legitimately convinced these repeated dips just below 10k and then back up are a strong sign of shitloads of people feeling that anything under 10k is an ideal buy zone for this moment in time.

So the “prophecy” is officially 2 for 2. I don’t know about you guys but I’ve been here a long time and it’s fucking *rare* to see someone make a legitimate prediction and have it come even *close* to happening. This includes TA articles. Always wrong. Very rare. But two?  And *months* in advance?  Never.   Never seen it.  I rarely see someone make a prediction for the next 24hours and even come close. Prophecy predicted 9,200USD in July and on July 17 we went down to a market aggregate of 9,183USD. That’s insane. I’m not saying I’m fully convinced October will be 16k, but I’m officially intrigued.

So I’m trying to set up a lightning node using Joule. I have my bitcoin node up and running, all synced up. I have Joule working. My only point of slight confusion is, I guess, why am I opening a lightning channel?  It seems like you need around $50 to fund an open channel. I’m perfectly willing to do that, $50 ain’t shit, I’m just wondering if that’s actually what I *should* do. 
Will it help the network for me to do this?  What can I do with the $50 worth of BTC that will be in the channel?  Anyone have advice on which channel I should connect to?  
The guy who put together the how-to I’m using offers his but, again, not sure that’s what I should do. Any informed help would be so appreciated.

Yes trezor or nano can both hold most altcoins at this point. As far as which model, I don’t really know as I haven’t looked into it, but I assume newer ones just have a fancier screen and other bells and whistles, can’t imagine functionality or security is that different. I’m sure the website explains it. 
My only real tip is to buy it from trezor or nano directly, don’t buy it from amazon or somewhere else to save a couple bucks. It’s not worth it. And then once you have it come up with a strong system for never losing the seed. Fire proof safe is what I use.

Every day miners around the world compete to mine blocks for a reward of 12.5 bitcoins per block. Around 144 blocks are mined each day (I think). So that’s 1,800 *new* BTC hitting the market every day. When the halvening happens, as it has before as they are scheduled events set to happen when we cross certain overall block numbers, that reward is cut in half from 12.5 to 6.25. Before the last halvening the reward was 25BTC per block.  Theoretically, given that demand should remain the same, as daily supply is suddenly cut in half price should be squeezed upward. Basically there will be a drought of new BTC (900 per day instead of 1,800) on the market suddenly, and if all other factors besides that remain constant, the restricted supply affects price advantageously.

Nothing to worry about imo. I was surprised it stayed above 9k for as long as it did. Last time we hit like $9,050 and dropped to $7,500. This time we hit $9,350 and I’ll be surprised if it goes lower than $8,700. Just an opinion and I’ll be back to admit it if I’m wrong.

If you buy $100 at 9k if we ever hit 500k per bitcoin that $100 will be worth $5,555. If you bought $100 at 8k and same scenario, it would be worth $6,250. Its such a small amount it makes no appreciable difference.

@_date: 2019-06-23 11:16:43
I just transferred around $190 USD from a desktop wallet to my trezor.  The fee was about $1.30 and transferred in about 20 minutes.  Are we doing better with fees this time around, or is this the sort of thing people complain about with high fees and slow Txs?  Because if so, I don't get it.  If you are doing a business transaction, Sending $190 with paypal costs, I believe, more than 5 dollars.  Granted that costs the seller not the sender, but still.  Don't even get me started on how much westernunion costs.  If you physically drive to one with cash its still $5.  Forget about a bank account transfer, the fees are insane. $9 and itll take FOUR DAYS.  How is even a $1.50 fee and 20 minutes to transfer not a win at this point for BTC?  Genuinely asking because looking into the competitors just now has me slightly baffled.  I guess venmo and paypal between friends is still cheaper and faster?  Should I be upset it costs $1.50 and not .15 cents?

My theory is a bunch of slightly smarter people were planning to sell around 10k but noticed it didn’t slow down at all. As soon as it leveled out around 11,200 for like 20-30 minutes the selling started. Can’t blame people for profit taking and I appreciate that they waited.
@_date: 2019-08-04 14:02:12
Yea I would love to do Casa Node but it’s $300...per year. Even as a one time $300 purchase that seems a bit steep (you do get a hardware wallet, but I already have one, and there isn’t a cheaper option to buy one without it) but as an annual membership?  Seems crazy

Robinhood doesn’t involve buying actual bitcoin as far as I know
@_date: 2019-06-28 15:39:25
Well as was said it the price keeps going there’s no loss of value. 12.5BTC AT 11,000 is the same as 6.25BTC at 22,000. Not to mention even if it’s not equal making any amount of bitcoin from mining is going to still be profitable. Not only that, but miners also get the transaction fees for each block. So the idea is that even in 2140 when all 21 million coins have been mined the network will stay active because those Tx fees will be lucrative enough on its own.

@_date: 2019-06-28 16:59:24
I don’t know the economics of what price makes it profitable vs not but I trust that the miners do understand it enough that they know what they’re doing. If you read the white paper it was designed to always work out. I’m no economist though. But I don’t think the situation you describe is very likely. Aside from everything else if it was profitable for miners to be doing it 5 years ago when they were worth considerably less it’s always going to be attractive to people out there to be getting bitcoin rewards. If the price truly craters the whole experiment is over anyway, so what’s the difference?
@_date: 2019-06-25 20:01:48
If it doesn’t make any monetary difference just wait. I don’t see a downside unless BTC literally goes to zero, which becomes less and less likely every second.
@_date: 2019-06-14 13:54:33
Sure but the volume rising along with price is a good indication that the price movement is strong and can be trusted. If the volume was stagnant or dropping its more like to be a pump and dump or fall back down. At least that’s what I’ve been reading last few days.

That’s impossible. Even if you bought at 20k you couldn’t be down more than 45% or so right now.

I picked all good projects except XRP. Too many coins. Usecases haven’t materialized. No one seems to be genuinely interested anymore. I think Libra will kill it. Luckily of all my holdings I’m only down like a hundred bucks on ripple. Waffling on whether to wait and see if it can get back to even or if I should just eat the loss and trade for more BTC.
@_date: 2019-06-14 13:26:06
Can anyone who has also been around for a good while talk to me about volume for a second?  I've only begun paying attention to volume as an indicator in the last month or so.  The highest I've seen is like 29.5billion.  Lowest was like 16billion some time last week.  But I don't have enough context to really know if 29B is genuinely or just relatively high.  Is 16B genuinely or relatively low?  Just trying to get a handle on whats typical I guess.
@_date: 2019-06-04 14:40:50
Problem is the odds of whoever buying them actually using BTC to pay is slim to none. Sell them for cash and buy the coin yourself.
@_date: 2019-06-01 12:41:15
You open a wallet and copy and paste the address from that wallet into coinbases Destination tag for the transfer. It’s not rocket science honestly. Not even sure how to dumb that down further.

No he clearly means people who bought at 9k, 10k 12k 20k etc on the way up and were “left holding the bag” when it crashed to 3.5k for a year. That’s what bag holders means. Many of those people will sell at their break even.

I’d also be curious to hear from anyone who knows about nodes. Always wanted to run one, seemed like too much hassle. Nimblenode appears to make it super simple.

Again between the time it would take for 20 dollars to turn into anything (BEST case scenario you have $400 if BTC ever hits 200k) and then withdraw with fees and taxes in two years you could have....like $350 bucks. Or, again, nothing. 
@_date: 2019-06-17 02:28:07
Even easier way is 100 divided by 9,000 (so purchase amount divided by purchase point price) is .0111111. Any given number (9,000 or 90,000 or 900,000) times .011111 is what your hundred dollars is now worth.

He said “only 210 million people can own .1 BTC” (technically true but not even remotely accurate to reality) and that because he owns .1 only 209 million people can own .1 now. That involves counting himself as 1 million people. Not me who doesn’t understand basic math.

Better to dip from 11,200 to 10k then 10,200 to 9k. Going that high was a gift. I’ll be surprised if we drop into the 9s much. Probably more likely than I think but believe we can hold 10

Well it’s good to know it’s still useful even if I somehow completely missed the point. I’m new to this whole game. But it is safer/better than storing it an Electrum wallet, which is what I was doing, right?

That’s why it’s the best to have enough to sell some at 50k or 100k and still have a fair amount left to let it ride.

It makes me sick to go creep into and look at all the bullshit. Noobs are coming in asking for advice and they push BCH so fucking hard. Downvote anyone who mentions actual bitcoin. They are below 4% ratio to bitcoin and they still won’t accept they failed. Meanwhile BSV has managed to get up to 50% ratio with BCH. The whole thing is a fucking joke. They’ve all been had. I just feel bad for the rubes who are going to be misled. That sub is so full of misinformation and bullshit. Terrible for the crypto space.

matter of personal preference.  i like Trezor, but I can't really say why I like it more than my Nano.  I find it slightly easier to use, you interact more with the website and less using the actual device to navigate.  I could see why someone would prefer Nano, though.

@_date: 2019-06-17 11:59:31
It’s called arbitrage. It’s a super risky game and unless you’re a whale the difference will be a few dollars profit for a lot of stress. Not to mention transaction and transfer fees. It’s always seemed to me only an algorithm could act fast enough a few thousand times a day for it to add up to anything worth while. But go for it?

Close but not quite. We hit $9,393 the other day
@_date: 2019-06-17 01:39:31
It’s pretty basic math. You buy $100 worth at $9,000 per bitcoin. It goes to any given number, in this case $500,000. 500,000 divided by 9,000 is 55.55. 100 multiplied by 55.55 is 5,555. You have $5,555. If it went to$100,000 instead?  100,000 divided by 9,000 is 11.11. 100 times 11.11 is 1,111. You have $1,111. If it went to $4,500 instead?  4,500 divided by 9,000 is .5. 100 times .5 is 50. You’d have $50.
@_date: 2019-06-14 18:16:54
I’d guess there will be some gap in service from when it’s shut off to US users and the new one comes online. And yes, probably need to get re-authorized

....you can transfer it back and sell it. Jesus.
@_date: 2019-06-23 22:37:59
Yea and when coinbase gets hacked or servers shut down temporarily because the volume goes nuts and they can’t keep up then you don’t have anything and can’t sell anywhere until they let you. Not your keys?  Not your coin.
@_date: 2017-11-25 04:10:26

Best case scenario in a few years it’s worth $2500, you withdraw it with fees and taxes, and make like 1800 dollars. $100 just isn’t enough to see a significant return
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:03:49
Coinbase is very legit. You have to link your bank account if you are going to be making transaction between the two, how else would it work?  With the fees though you won’t be holding 200 in coin, maybe like 190. Were at 7500 now and I’m hoping it never goes below 7000 again. If you bought in now, and let’s say it goes up to 10k by January, you now have like 230 worth of bitcoin. In a year or two if it went up to 198k like Forbes recently predicted in a few years you’ll have a little over 5,000 dollars.  Also a chance it’s eventually worth absolutely nothing if things don’t go our way in the long run.  Is this all worth it to you?  If 200 bucks is really such a huge fucking deal it makes me nervous. Think it over. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 14:50:29

@_date: 2017-11-29 04:12:39
Lol anyone who owns 1 bitcoin is currently worth just over $10k. Most people own a fraction of that. Some lucky few own enough for that to be worth a million dollars or more (would require owning 100btc currently). So no, we aren’t all millionaires. But our worth is currently going up and our investment doing well. Will that continue? No one knows. In a year will bitcoin be worth $50k or $5? No one knows for sure. Those invested hope it keeps going well and adoption rises, more vendors get on board and accept it, and our investment pays off. Some say it’s going to crater as a speculative bubble and everyone will wake up one day and see we actually own nothing. Time will tell. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 14:20:03

@_date: 2019-06-28 12:21:29
Nobody knows what will happen, and anybody who says they do is a liar. That being said, if you look back on the last ten years of bitcoin charts there literally is not one single reason to believe it won’t continue to appreciate in value. You should try to learn more about the project and why it’s valuable, as opposed to just looking to make profits in a USD.  But that’s up to you. 
As far as next year, the halvening’s are very interesting events. Again, no one knows for sure what will happen this time, but I believe in the past the lead up to halvings have been more interesting than immediately after, but I’m no expert. Mining rewards get cut in half. Supply is constrained. Assuming demand remained constant price should be squeezed up.  I explained it better [here](

@_date: 2019-04-02 20:18:08
You know what’s weird about that?  Usually once or twice a day I just google the word bitcoin to see what the top trending news or twitter post is saying. Yesterday there was an article headline about two ETFs being approved, but when I clicked on it it wouldn’t load. I tried to find it again and it was gone. I honestly thought it was an April fools joke or a mistake something that accidentally got posted for a second. But maybe some people know things we don’t.

It’s been awhile since we’ve had something truly new. Even your iPhone example....all the iPhone ever did was combine things we already used. It offered nothing new except ease of use. The internet is the last truly new thing humanity has come up with. And it took nearly 30 years to become ubiquitous.

Agree on all counts. I didn’t really consider VR, but even with that as an example, it’s taken 20 years for it to not be complete garbage, and even now with multiple HMDs available that are all consumer-level easy to set up and use, it’s still ridiculously niche.

  I meant dipshit as in he bought the peak and sold at the low, and he did it *because* he has so much money it doesn’t matter to him at all. That’s not news. That’s just a thing a guy did. They are using it as a weapon to scare regular people into thinking that will happen to them. It won’t. Unless you’re a dipshit.
@_date: 2019-04-23 17:51:07
Lots of bullish news about golden crosses and 200day moving averages. Gonna pop over 6k this week is my bet. 
Also lots of FUD about some dipshit ceo who lost 130mil by buying at the peak and selling his position. Seen like 5-6 articles reporting the same dumbass story. It’s not even news. It’s one guy being a fuck up. Seems to be coordinated FUD imo. It didn’t even happen recently. It was last summer.

It did operate that way for a time but it’s impossible to buy without providing ID etc now. If you want a currency to buy legal products you can’t do that without regulation. Regulation will make bitcoin useful, but not how you want it to. Nothing will ever give you that freedom. Why? Because what government would allow that?

Still not a dump. At its at 10,500 right now. Stop trying to be dramatic. Dude was wrong like everyone else in here always is. You don’t know what a dump is clearly. 
Also how many hours does this guy get credit for?  If real dump happened 24 hours later does “waiting a few hours for dump” still count? What about tomorrow?  How many hours does one get?
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:09:15
That’s not really how 50/50 odds work in a situation like that. That’s like saying every day you wake up and there’s a 50/50 chance it’ll rain. That’s accurate in the binary (it’ll either rain, or it wont), but that’s not really what the odds of rain are each day if you look out the window. Looking out the window in bitcoin is 4-5 years of continual support and improvement. Many dips and “crashes” later it’s still worth more today than most would’ve thought possible a year ago. So the odds aren’t 50/50. It’s much more heavily favored bitcoin will not end up being worth zero than odds that it will. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 14:42:04
That doesn’t make sense. You can’t just...have all the predictions. I swear to god this sub just keeps getting dumber. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 14:56:46
The year isn’t over yet.  I only ever heard mcafee and other “tech celebs” say 50k was reasonable at some point in 2018, but it won’t stay there. Two months down. I don’t know what’s going to happen but I know that nothing those guys has said has been wrong. Have we crashed to zero? No. Have we hit moon? No. So what’s with all the drama?  Being above 10k is pretty stellar on its own after all the drama in last 90 days. 
My only point, ever, if you look through
My history, is that NO ONE, not one person in this sub knows what will happen next, and that after spending s good amount of time here for the last half year I can confidently say 99% of predictions, especially ones that predict something to happen “soon” or “within a few hours” are dead wrong. And anyone who is right is right by coincidence. This sub is Bullshit central.

You guys it DUMPED FROM 10,800 when I woke up to 10,400, and now it’s PUMPING back to 10,550!?  
This is you. This is what you all sound like. Neither of those things are a pump or a dump or anything else interesting. 
We’ve gone from 20k to a true dump down to 6k and we’ve steadily been climbing back up. That’s not a pump. Dropping a few hundred dollars before rebounding is not a dump. 
Just here to remind everyone to stay calm, hodl, and not listen to any of the retardation on this daily thread. Every single day it’s different people making the same dramatic pronouncements that THEY FIGURED IT OUT. They didn’t. No one has. No one knows what will happen. It may dump today. I don’t know. But I know that no one can predict it.

Let’s not forget this exact pattern happened when we hit 10k. I pretty much expect it at every 1k increment. Well go past it, and a certain percentage of people who bought on the way down to 6k, managed to hold but don’t want to play anymore are going to sell and push it under. But it’ll push back past once enough people either break even or take their gains at every grand. That’s my thought anyway.

No one knows what’s going to happen but I’ll give you best case scenario. Magic happens and bitcoin moons beyond almost anyone’s wildest project, it hits $1million USD per 1 Bitcoin. You’re $5 dollars is now worth....$625 minus fees and taxes. An incredible return on investment but not enough to even pay rent for a month. And bitcoin will not hit 1million in a year, or probably ever, and I’m quite bullish. More possible but still somewhat outlandish would be $100kUSD per coin. Your $5 is now worth $62.50 minus fees and taxes.   This is just simple math. It’s not hard. My honest guess is in a year your $5 will be worth either zero or about $40.

Every person here should officially disregard this sub, or at least these daily threads, as anything helpful or useful. These are just unhealthy. No one here has any clue what they are talking about. The amount of new accounts this sub seems to draw is overwhelming, and all of them are either bad actors spreading fud, dopes who shouldn’t be playing the game to begin with, or hand-wringers who just come here to say things like “who else thinks it’ll go up today?” Or “anyone else see us going down to 9.5-9k range??” with absolutely nothing to back it up. Not that anyone has anything to back a claim up here because we all know nothing.  Anyone asking for advice here, and then acting on advice from whichever random idiot responds first, is a fool.

Also reminder to newbies, history shows nothing will happen on or near the actual halvening. I believe the data supports the biggest change 5-6 months after. There may be some evidence to support some run up leading into it, but I don’t think it’s nearly as strong. 
The halvening is a great thing. But the “hype” around it is being wildly blown out of proportion, imo. There is no evidence to support that anything will happen on “Halvening Day”. That being said, new things happen all the time.

@_date: 2019-09-02 15:59:03
No I’m sure they have some method. I’m just saying it’s not real, whatever it is. If there was a real method there would be accurate predictions more often. Which there are not. So I’m saying you can come up with any system to make predictions you want. Doesn’t mean it will ever be right. I’m not saying the number is random though. I’m sure they have something they consider a method. The only real test is how often have they been even close to correct?

That's idiotic. Spending 2k means nothin to me. A bad investment does. Only a moron just spends 2k on a bitcoin without researching whether this guys claim is even remotely accurate. Which is what I was asking. Is it actually worth it for me to invest in this?  I'm skeptical.

Just something to think about.

I’ll tell you what makes me most nervous for BTCs future. It’s not bcash, or high fees, or hash power or anything. It’s the fact that the more attention we attract, the more people seem to come in who are legit too stupid to be their own bank. I’m just not sure society as a whole can handle this responsibility. Every day we get more and more comments “duuur I didn’t save my seed words what do?!” Or “should I let my brother hold my coins for me?”  Maybe this sub just attracts dipshits but I feel like the average person can’t handle being in control of their own money. They don’t seem to see how serious it is.

@_date: 2019-05-23 11:47:03
Not really. The people who get scammed or locked out of their coin just become one more voice ignorantly saying bitcoin is a scam, or not worth it, etc. We need to be attracting more users. And you can’t do that without being user friendly.  I don’t know how you make bitcoin user friendly. Being your own bank is a huge responsibility. Don’t know about you but I don’t consider too many people I know truly intelligent and responsible.

Absolutely. Just understand the math. If you buy $500 worth at $7000 per bitcoin and let’s say theoretically BTC hits 100k per bitcoin your $500 would be worth about $7,100. It’s not a ticket to unimaginable wealth and its probably going to take a few years of holding onto it.

There are a lot of people here and here’s a crazy thought, not everyone is the same. Some have what they want to hold. Some still want more.

Nothing is for certain but I’ve been holding from 1,000 to 20,000 down to 3,000 and back up to 8,000. I have no doubt it will go up again. It’s difficult to find anyone these days who genuinely thinks bitcoin will end up being worthless. But anything can happen. Don’t invest more than you can afford to lose. Best case scenario you are gonna be holding for two years at least if you want to see major gains, so take that into account

I have a trezor and a nano. I think the trezor is much easier to use. But nano is good too

Aside from technical bullshit in there, most of this FUD makes no sense to me. You know what system is absolutely rife with fraud and theft?  Money. All money. Any money ever made throughout the history of ever. All the funds were protected by their SAFU fund, just like all fiat in a bank is backed by the full faith and credit of the US government.  It doesn’t seem relevant except to scare people. Bitcoin exchanges can be hacked!! ....so can your bank account. Who gives a fuck?
Also if you aren’t retarded and take your coins into your own control there’s no one to blame
For security lapses except yourself. That seems ideal to me.

I think people are interested in crypto but 8k for a bitcoin is well out of reach for most people. You look into other projects that seem promising and look to find...oh shit these are cheap as hell!  Ima buy allllll of it. 
Happened to quite a few of us two years ago. I’m well into the green on my bitcoin holdings but still down a few hundred bucks on my alts. And I bought the good ones. They only make up 5% of my portfolio though lol. 95% BTC

I keep thinking about that one whale who made that like 100million dollar buy spread across exchanges at like midnight when we were around $3,500. Fucking genius. Literally bought as close to the bottom as possible and basically jump started this whole thing.
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:35:22
Well that was mean
@_date: 2019-05-10 17:12:05
...everyones different bud.  Some of these people bought on the 2017 bull run and feel like they got duped. plenty of people just trying to make themselves whole again.  plenty of people day trading, expecting a retrace, take their profits and hope to play again soon.  some people probably bought at 3500 and are happy to take a 3k profit and be done with crypto. plenty of people who play the market their own way.  You can't expect everyone to just be all in hodlers at all levels.  *that* would be fishy

What do you mean?  You want to sell bitcoin you have stored on a Trezor?  You want to buy bitcoin on coinbase and hold it in a trezor?  No clue what your goal is from comment

Fuck BCH
@_date: 2019-05-10 17:09:42
There’s literally nothing fishy about that. Every time the price hits a nice fat round number or key resistance a bunch of people take their profits and run. It happens every single time.
@_date: 2019-05-16 18:25:52
It depends. I’m very lucky, I work around a lot of lawyers so the guy I talked to is a friend, giving me a good deal. I believe he normally charges about $800.  It’s a complex thing, and the price can depend on how complex your estate is going to be. You could probably write up your own will and get it notarized for very like $100 or less using legalzoom or something, but my biggest concern is giving the information (half my seed words, the combination to my safe, etc) to someone I trust and whose job it is to work in my interests. I would call around. You could probably find someone who runs a private practice to do it for you pretty cheap and easy, especially if your assets are just your bank account and your crypto. I also own some guns and a lot of expensive tech that I’d like to see go to someone who would use it, so that’s adds some complexity. Probably depends where you live too. I imagine it’s more in a major city than in a small town, etc.

I don’t even know how to panic anymore. If you bought coin before the 2017 run and then held it through the last 15 months, you’re as hardened as they come. Nerves of steel?  Nah. It’s more like I don’t even have any nerves anymore. I feel nothing.
@_date: 2019-05-13 21:57:38
Yes you are locked in at the price you purchased. That’s how every exchange I’ve used works. Just waiting for the transaction to clear so you can have access to it. If you bought some amount at 7000, and tomorrow it clears and BTC is at 8500, you made money. Same if it goes to 6500 though, you lost money.

I’d rather be a little harsh and make sure someone knows they might be approaching this wrong and thus lose all their money than be too nice and watch this dude buy some GBTC

You encrypt a file with the seed words, any passwords they’ll need, how to access the hardware wallet if necessary, etc onto a USB and give that to someone you trust, ideally a lawyer.  Either make sure that person knows who to give the usb to if you die, or make a Will with those instructions. You give a sealed envelope with the instructions to get the usb from lawyer/whoever and the decryption code to the person you want to be able access your coin after you die.  When you die the person you left the decryption code with can access the usb, recreate the wallet, and go from there.

Yea looking like another failed attempt unfortunately.

I wouldn’t say the chance of it going up ten dollars are the same as it going to zero. That’s pretty disingenuous.
@_date: 2019-05-10 16:14:52
I bought some ripple around .70 cents. If it ends up bottoming out so be it, but I find it hard to believe it won’t hit at least a dollar at some point. I’ll probably bail then. 
Apologies for discussing alts here.
@_date: 2019-05-07 14:26:14
Every battle over a round number is the same. Punch above by 15-20 bucks, fall below by 50. Punch back to 20-30 above, fall below by 30-40. Punch above to 50. Fall below by 20. And on and on until it punches straight through or the bulls give up.

The cost to mine one bitcoin in the United States. According to a recently published analysis conducted by Elite Fixtures, which examined the electricity costs of 115 countries, the United States ranked as the 40th cheapest to mine a single bitcoin, with an average cost of $4,758.
This was published over a year ago.  I imagine its higher now.

Also I just updated my trezor two days ago. No issues. But it makes it very clear don’t do it if you don’t have your seed words.

I honestly expected to drop closer to 7k as support before any rebound. Pleasantly surprised today, even if it’s only back around 7,800.

@_date: 2019-05-16 19:17:41
You should know that really won’t cover everything though. A lawyer can create a will that lets your beneficiaries avoid having to deal with probate and opening an estate etc to get your money. It is cheaper, but it’s cheaper for a reason. Just sayin.
A website also won’t provide a secure place for you to keep everything. Or provide a human being who now works for you.

My comment didn’t last two hours. This morning there was a lot of action in the 5,890’s but kept getting beaten back. At the times of that comment we had fallen back to 5,850s. Didn’t last long though. Over 5,900 now
