Do you mean this tongue-in-cheek or do you have a serious line of thinking behind that? Genuinely confused/curious

Let me take another stab - the main issue is that if I were to move some portion of my bitcoin during the UASF chaos, the portion I moved would be on a different chain from whichever chain Coinbase supports? What if I moved all of it at once? Could I pick which chain to move to? Do people with hardware wallets get to pick which chain their bitcoin are on?

You're awesome. This is the kind of answer I was looking for. Many thanks!
I looked into Trezor and kind of decided that if I'm going to get a hw wallet, the Ledger Nano S looks like the better buy. BUT they're on back order through August 6... convenient... So I might just make sure I know how to get my coin out of Coinbase without going through them for now.

But I do have the keys to my Coinbase multisig wallet. What's the difference with a hardware wallet? Just that I have the bitcoin right in front of me, instead of on a Coinbase server?

As a noob, I've been seeing this sentiment a lot without any explanation for why. I have a multisig vault on Coinbase. What are the risks, exactly? 
I read another user's comment suggesting that Coinbase might steal my password. If that's the only risk involved, I'm not really concerned. Are there any others?

Convenience. I also bought ETH and am considering investing in LTC soon. All 3 are easily accessible on Coinbase, and I have the keys. So calling it somebody else's wallet isn't really fair anyway.
Someone else told me to "just buy a Trezor." That's $100 and much less convenient. If it's worth it, I want to do it, but so far I haven't heard a compelling reason. I simply don't believe Coinbase is going to fuck up their business to pull a cheap scam on their millions of users.
