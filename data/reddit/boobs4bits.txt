Bitcoin can still provide credit, by using a multiSig wallet.  The Lender would control a spend key.  
Also I'll take a lifetime referral of 0.1% to anyone that takes this idea and runs with it --&gt; 1BiyWSYRCKuQEg22XXi9vuuxwahA35AAYn

Someone needs to get Reddit to upgrade their username process to allow usernames to be bitcoin addresses, and passwords private keys.
Then MultiSig Accounts would allow this via a moderator
Posts would be group payment structure
It could even be voted on

Go look at stuxnet, and you'll realize the Cryptolocker people are small peanuts compared to national spy programs, and what they can do.
Also go look at  and realize everything is rapidly getting connected, and 'bitcoin' is one of the current most searched terms.
Lastly note, that Satoshi was genius in using ECDSA vs RSA.

Although this is a fun experiment, I see the future as MultiSig brainwallets that allow for simpler passwords but exponetnially more dificult to breaking attempts like yours.
