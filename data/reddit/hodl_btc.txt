My guess is that Samsung is already researching a generation of phones that are optimized for crypto storage. A component of the phone will be air-gapped. Something like this will be the game changer.

Western Europe just woke up, they must be feeling bullish. Hopefully this carries on until the East Coast shift takes over in a few hours.

Yeah, I'm 90% BTC at this point. It's going to be fun to see where things head in the next 5 years!

Thanks Merriam-Webster, glad you made the long trip over from r/personalfinance to parrot that sage advice!

Excellent work! Keep buying at each paycheck, and HODL strong! Congrats, and welcome to the party!

You're the smart one. People have mental paralysis, and are very unlikely to adopt new and risky things, even with huge potential payoff. Just the way we're wired.
Basically, this:

AFAIK, you can wire an unlimited amount of money into Coinbase, and it is available same day.

Congrats! You are going to be very happy with your decision!!

You must have snapped that very quickly, since it only took another minute to get to $6063

A better way to represent this data would be to show logarithmic increments, rather than linear. Clearly, Bitcoin is not undergoing linear growth. But, I like the idea here!
@_date: 2017-10-31 01:44:10
We need more people like Richard, telling the truth about bcash and 2x. Excellent work!
@_date: 2017-10-20 23:13:23
I don’t think you understand data 
@_date: 2017-10-21 20:47:02
I disagree.
Early adopters are the first 12% according to this definition. That means 1/8 people.
How many people are on your facebook feed? 400?
Assuming you have 400 facebook friends, do you really think more than 32 of them have BTC?
@_date: 2017-10-21 21:38:03
What's the game changer here? Who can you trust to hold keys for you, in a trust-less, decentralized system?
@_date: 2017-10-31 00:06:13
Is this real?
@_date: 2017-10-21 18:22:28
Very nice analysis. I think the major issue with prior projections is that they do not account for institutional money. It looks like your projection does account for this, and I would put things in the same ballpark as you.
The only issue I have is that the projection does not account for loss of BTCs over time... this deflationary pressure vs. the inflationary pressure of fiat will magnify the growth. My guess is that 50% of all BTC will be lost from circulation in 3 years time.
@_date: 2017-10-21 18:57:38
Also, within 5-7 years, a wave of high school teenagers will be entering the workforce. They will be the first generation of young professionals to feel more comfortable with BTC than fiat. This will accelerate the revolution.

And it’s going to be awesome

- Because Jamie will fire you
- Because you can't get Ultimate Rewards points
- Because paying taxes on the returns will be painful
- Because taking a few hours on learning the ins and outs of the system and how to properly secure your BTC could be better used watching Rick and Morty reruns
- etc.
Actually, you'd be a fool to not put 30K in now, if you've actually done your research on Bitcoin.

I see where you are coming from but your comment made me laugh. Where does he think that his money lives? All of his money already lives on the internet. Where is this physical money you speak of? Gold bars in a safe somewhere?

BTC Gold fork

They killed it a while back didn’t they? This article’s a little late to the Japan party.  If anyone propelled BTC to current heights it is JPN. USA and EU are way behind the 8 ball.

Only question for you based on this projection... are you still long ETH, or did you redistribute your 80% ETH portfolio?
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:46:57
@_date: 2017-10-21 22:13:51
Interesting. I imagine the lack of assets to invest is the limiting factor in young people doing more research on BTC. However, those assets will become available very soon as younger people enter the workforce.

More like Round 10. BTC has won every round
@_date: 2017-10-21 21:24:49
My impression is that things go "viral" much more quickly among teens. For example, I can't figure out how the hell to use Snapchat, but every damn teen uses it, and it only took a year to be more dominant than Facebook in your demographic. I think that neuroplasticity allows teens to accept new societal changes like BTC much more quickly than old folk like me.

Nice. HODL 
@_date: 2017-10-21 18:32:21
I will sell 1 BTC when $800,000 USD = 1 BTC
Buying and HODLing until then.

Bullish news. Great to have regulatory clarity. They are not banning exchanges. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 16:49:04
Interesting that the log phase growth has only accounted for private buyers. When institutional buyers join the market, things will veer upwards from that curve.

Do you understand how swiping your Visa card results in the downstream network transmissions that result in the transaction of currency? Doubt it. But you still use it. One day, BTC will simply be accepted.
@_date: 2017-10-21 21:40:53
Yes, just go to your wallet in Coinbase, and choose "wire transfer" as the method of deposit. Only a $20 fee. Then send that money over to GDAX, and pay no fees to buy BTC.
