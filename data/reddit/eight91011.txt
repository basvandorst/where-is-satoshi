Run [Electrum server](
It's a very simple request.
And you will succeed in syncing Electrum server, surely, due to its *very reasonable resource requirements*. Just kidding! You'll probably fail.
But since I *know* you really will *try* running Electrum server, since you're totally not all talk and no action, I will recommend you buy a surge protector for your computer, as you wouldn't want your Electrum server to shut down improperly after days and days of syncing. That would be too bad! In fact, running Bitcoin services is often like walking a tight rope, and that's at 1MB blocks. It's gobs and gobs of fun for admins, like a neverending carnival for masochists! In fact, here's a *genius* idea: *let's make it 2000% more difficult to run Electrum server*. What do sysadmins know, anyway? We're just shills! Shills I tell you.
And if Electrum server's too easy for a fellow like you, *and I know it won't be*, then you're clearly an action-taker which is very commendable. Next you should try [libbitcoin server]( Ooh, this one is even more fun! Get ready for a fantastic adventure of epic proportions.
Why? Well of course libbitcoin server is the only production ready implementation of stealth payments and if you can't run it, well, that's just too bad isn't it? It would be too bad if the resource requirements for running real Bitcoin services were simply *too huge* at 1MB blocks, right? But that's surely not the reality! Not at all! Sysadmins are just shills, remember?
On a more somber note, if you think this is all "BS" then prove me wrong. I'm pointing you to free open source software and telling you to *run it*.

Like an [Electrum server]( or [Libbitcoin server](
Great! Why don't you try running one on your hardware right now? It's **critical** to this debate that more people try it. At the very least, try running a basic [block explorer]( You can't get very far in a Bitcoin startup without at least maintaining a loosely defined blockchain API. Scratch that - you can, if you're willing to use a centralized proprietary API, thereby destroying your startup's ability to remain trustless.
I would love to see more people set up Electrum server at 1MB blocks, I guarantee you it will be one of those "AHA" moments for thousands of people. Think that's easy? Try Libbitcoin server then. They're the only production ready implementation of stealth addresses, which so many of us are amped up about.


People have been trying to get consumers to buy into pre-outfitted Raspberry Pis for easier running of Tor and services that they'd otherwise outsource to the cloud. Those ideas almost all flopped for many reasons, but this is the chief reason it couldn't work for Bitcoin:
a RPI is just a Linux server and if you aren't a Linux sysadmin, you're *going* to encounter issues 1) maintaining it, 2) upgrading it, and 3) troubleshooting it. Your RPI will not care that you bought it from a manufacturer. It will not care that your power got cut out. It will not care if the rest of the Bitcoin network deploys an upgrade leaving you behind after a potential soft or hard fork. It's simply impossible to bottle up the real world skills and abilities needed to navigate those situations and deliver them in a neat and tidy basket for mass consumption.


Please, run Electrum server or Libbitcoin server at 1MB blocks and then get back to me about how thrilled you'd be for that entire process to be 2000% more difficult than it already is.


I am not a fan of the current "balance". As anyone who runs a block explorer or Electrum server will attest, the resource requirements for running real Bitcoin services are sky high at 1MB blocks. Technology needs time to catch up. If that costs us some adoption, so be it. The real long term holders are the ones who value Bitcoin not for buying coffee or paying for bed sheets, but for holding over the long term as a digital gold that is incredibly easy and simple to take with you, impossible to seize by the government, of fixed supply and censorship resistant.
@_date: 2015-06-02 00:23:20
I'm an opponent. Will you proponents of 20MB *please* go run Electrum server on mainnet? There has been zero discussion about the services that run *atop* full nodes.
I am sick and tired of hearing for the billionth time how "easy" it is to put a node on your RPI or how inane Peter Todd's opinions are. Run [Electrum server]( No gimmicks. Then you can come back here and tell me *all* about how "easy" it for "us" to scale Bitcoin up to 20MB. "us" is in scare quotes because really you're putting the onus on people like me to support people like you who have ZERO appreciation for the immense amount of resources that go into supporting Bitcoin TODAY with NO CHANGES.
Scaling Bitcoin isn't just about full nodes. Full nodes are just the beginning. It's the services that run atop of those nodes that truly matter! If you want to just pretend as if those services like Electrum don't exist, *fine*. But we aren't debating anything at that point, we're just yelling over each other, getting nowhere at all.
For the last time: run [Electrum server]( Report back with how "easy" it is at 1MB blocks to support commonly used network service in a decentralized way.

And at least 90% of the people reading this are all talk no action.
There's a difference between being idealogically extreme, and having the motivation to procure a 1TB hard drive year after year after year. In fact, I bet over 50% of the people reading this would shit their pants after *attempting* to sync any of [insight]( [libbitcoin-server]( or [electrum-server](
Sure, they'll run the consumer facing component of this architecture, but they don't have the mental fortitude to follow through with even this simplistic and lightweight demands. Before you volun*tell* me to buy a 1TB hard drive year after year, how about you run Electrum server and feel what it's like to take up the better part of 100GB running a basic Bitcoin server.
Ask 90+% of Bitcoin investors to do *anything* with their money besides sit on it, and you will quickly find they are all talk.
Mark my words, we are vastly overestimating the loyalty and fortitude of the hive mind. These people are all talk. They won't have what it takes to procure a 1TB hard drive year over year over year. You people in favor of increasing the block size indefinitely better prove me wrong. I'm not wrong though. I'm officially on the lookout for a coin that shows a dedication towards minimizing blockchain size. I should mention I own hundreds of BTC - I just know this community is 90% bullshit when it comes to facing the music.
When the hive mind says, "we" as it pertains to "*we will run full nodes if it comes down to it*", what they really mean is **"someone who isn't me"** will deal with it. Well, no - only companies will deal with it, and that's going to pervert Bitcoin permanently. Congrats all. Looking forward to Bitcoin's future, seriously. This is undoubtedly Bitcoin's Myspace moment. Good luck betting it all on Moore's Law!

I'm a heavy SPV user, I don't condone bloom filtering SPV, but that's a different post.
Who do you think your SPV client connects to, You sound like a person who still believes in the "Santa Claus" Bitcoin P2P network that does not exist and has never existed at least not as people imagine it.
Someone has to run the full node. Even if you support SPV, there will still be nodes you connect to. Do you want those nodes in giant corporate controlled cloud datacenters? That's who eats your history with SPV, be it bloom filtering as per BitcoinJ or SSL authenticated SPV as per Electrum.
No, you want those nodes to be run in a diverse set of geographies and preferably owned by individuals running on hardware they physically have control over.
It's just a superior trust model. If you wanted the nodes to be run in the cloud, why?! For crying out loud, WHY?!
Look, people can run SPV nodes, as I do myself, but if you make it extremely offputting or close to impossible to run a full node, then all of them are going to end up in the cloud. That's total centralization, not just technologically speaking but politically speaking.
If all nodes are in the cloud, who owns the cloud, owns the nodes. You may *think* you own the node in the cloud because you're paying for it, but you are like a renter, subjugated to the whims of the company renting that space to you, and that company is in turn subjugated to the government which controls them and can imprison them equally on a whim. If that is your idea of an effective growth strategy for Bitcoin, I have no words.

Try running [electrum-server]( [libbitcoin-server]( or any [blockchain explorer]( and you will immediately recognize why the majority of technical leaders in Bitcoin oppose a block size increase with current technology.
Until this change is completely uncontroversial, as in our backs are against the wall like in the BDB network split, no action should be taken.
You have plenty of time to run a block explorer. I keep hearing from the people running 6-12 full nodes that it's "easy". Why haven't I heard back about how "easy" it is to maintain a block explorer? Could it be because it's genuinely *hard to run* most Bitcoin services?
@_date: 2015-05-29 20:17:28


That's a false dichotomy. There are projects like Open Transactions designed for this very use case. The only reason they go unnoticed is because the industry demands kicking the can. If block size was frozen at 1MB, the right folks would be incentivized to develop that software rather than exchanges or yet another payment processor. Thanks to this move by Gavin, that can't happen.
And by the way, the philosophy behind a block size increase is, if society does not tolerate Bitcoin, it shouldn't be done. That's the risk you run when you have nodes running out of a couple huge datacenters. You put the power to shut down Bitcoin squarely into the hands of the government.  At best, you are betting it all on Moore's Law.
As someone who supports a 1MB block size freeze, needs to fight fire with fire here. The biggest problem with this community is the people who have the biggest voice in Bitcoin almost universally lack any actual hands-on experience maintaining real Bitcoin infrastructure.  If it takes 10 days to bring a new block explorer up, this is effectively a 10 *day* delay in build times. Ideally, we could sync the blockchain instantly and test instantly, but the release cycle is crazy long with Bitcoin.
**Block explorers** which are essentially the basis for most wallet services and hence everything else in Bitcoin, are dependent upon optimizing the *developer* experience. Big VC backed companies tend to not appreciate this. Random redditors even moreso.
It's gut wrenching watching the same people who claim you can "easily" run a full node on a Raspberry Pi turn around and refuse to run an Electrum server on embedded devices because it's "too resource intensive". That isn't unique to running Electrum server, that goes for running any blockchain explorer. We're talking 100GB of storage space and not being able to sync up for 10 days. By increasing block size, that cost is only going to skyrocket until only big VC backed companies can run full nodes.
This causes Bitcoin to move to more of a ISP model, with huge datacenters running full nodes and everyone else has to pay a surcharge for what previously used to be free and open access.
@_date: 2015-05-31 02:13:50
Good, it should be much easier for you to try running libbitcoin-server, electrum-server, or any blockchain explorer of your choosing. Full node =/= Bitcoin service. Blockchain explorers are the basis of every important Bitcoin service almost without exception. And they all have enormous costs that I'm sure less than 1% of commenters are hands-on familiar with.
@_date: 2015-05-31 01:37:08
The biggest centralized exchanges and payment processors have become the gatekeepers of Bitcoin Core already, which is utterly frightening. They have the ultimate authority over Bitcoin's fungibility and hence decide what changes can and can't be made to the Bitcoin protocol.
Like every groundbreaking technology that came before Bitcoin - radio, TV, cell phones and the internet - Bitcoin will be pried from its grassroots origins by the most powerful business and political lobbyists.
In the future, when the individual cannot avoid using black box mobile devices - Android and iOS - which are thoroughly compromised, there will be no financial privacy left on this planet.
Staunch conservatism about block size increases is absolutely non-negotiable to me. To the people who claim running a full node is "easy": you need only try running Electrum server, Libbitcoin, or any blockchain explorer on your current best-of hardware to see without a doubt that the resource requirements for running Bitcoin services today are relatively speaking brutal.
If in the unlikely event billions of people are suddenly shoehorned into cryptocurrencies, this is ok - they can use centralized services.
But just like it is strictly optimum to have irreversible payment rails as the base layer of Bitcoin, and reversible payment layers on top of it, it is strictly **impossible** to have decentralized layers on top of an inherently centralized layer. Be conservative about blocksize increases, almost none of you parotting talking points and going with your gut instinct have the experience a single cofounder of Blockstream has on one finger. Listen to them. If you don't believe it, run your own Electrum server, Libbitcoin server or blockchain explorer - do it right now because until you do your opinion is dangerously uninformed.
@_date: 2015-05-31 16:33:18
Yep, and that's assuming flawless technical operation. If your server crashes without a proper shutdown of Electrum server? Start over again *from zero* :D
It's totally not frustrating or complex. In fact, here's a genius idea: let's make it 2000% more difficult.
@_date: 2015-05-31 15:17:12
If you erroneously believe a full node alone is enough to run a trustless Bitcoin company without using centralized middlemen like Blockchain.info and BlockCypher for proprietary API access, why should I take your opinion with anything but a pinch of salt. You clearly have no experience running a real Bitcoin service.
I'm pointing you to free open source software that you *seem to think* can be readily and trivially deployed on any hardware of your choosing. Go for it! Prove to me that it's "easy".
@_date: 2015-05-31 21:07:29
What about the people running block explorers and Electrum servers? Blockchain APIs have far higher resource requirements than many seem to realize. It is straining on high end hardware *today*, undeniably so.
If Electrum server were 20X more difficult to run, I simply could not run it from home, and I would need a dedicated server instance which would easily cost upwards of $100/mo. This is a major, current issue and by far the biggest issue I see with increasing the block size is what it will do to loosely defined Bitcoin API service providers. Running real Bitcoin services is incredibly resource intensive even at 1MB blocks.
Have you tried running [Electrum server](
@_date: 2015-05-31 17:09:00
So you'd rather do away with SSL authenticated SPV (Electrum)? How can you possibly expect Bitcoin to securely scale [with bloom filters alone]( What's your solution to scalability? Is your solution to kill Electrum and libbitcoin, *and* colored coins, *and* stealth payments?


You mean, aside from increasing the time it takes to deploy an Electrum server from 2 days - 2 weeks, to *40 days - 40 weeks*?
Yea I bet that will surely have no side effects in reality /sarcasm
Can you imagine it taking an entire year to deploy a most basic "scalable" piece of Bitcoin architecture? I certainly can, if we increase the block size before technology is allowed to catch up.
Who would do anything in a given industry if it took an entire month to deploy it? And who would be able to do it out of anything but a massive datacenter? In your quest to poke and prod Bitcoin you've totally undermined everything there is to like about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-05-31 15:37:52
Claiming blockchain APIs aren't a critical component of running Bitcoin services is like claiming a scope isn't a critical component of a sniper rifle.
Do you think this data comes standard in Bitcoin Core?
If Toshi and other such services were useless, and not deployed in the field, why do they exist?!
You people are arguing against technical experts with hands-on industry experience, claiming that because you can run a couple full nodes in your closet that's good enough and we should go ahead and make it excruciatingly painful to run blockchain APIs, which is a core competency of any real Bitcoin business. But, so long as you have that node in your closet, that's good enough for all of us, right? /derp

Based on what quantifiable, mathematically based calculations is Bitcoin usage going to spike 6 months?
Extrapolating based on perceived adoption waves is indecipherable from petty tea leaf technical analysis.

*Run it.*
Too hard? Here's an easy one:
- 
A basic block explorer, this one is *very* nicely done by BitPay and syncs relatively quickly. Now have a go at it.
- 
Let me know what you think about the resource requirements.
You can't run a startup on a full node in isolation.
@_date: 2015-05-31 16:57:28
You can't run Electrum server on a pruning full node. Sorry, I just don't do bloom filtering SPV - it's inferior to SSL authenticated SPV in almost every aspect.
And you can forget about colored coins. If you don't have the full chain validating all the way back, you can't parse OP_RETURN for colored coins.
[Stealth addresses]( You can forget those too. If you don't have the full chain validating all the way back, you can't parse OP_RETURN for stealth payments.
There is only so much you can do without a full blockchain. There's no getting around it, period end of story.

Coinbase, Bitstamp and every other exchange. Every centralized and decentralized Bitcoin wallet. Because their users won't be able to *use* the blockchain without paying exorbitant fees. Then, innovation will have to be done and we would see non-trivial manpower backing these efforts. What would take two years to develop could be done in half the time or less.
