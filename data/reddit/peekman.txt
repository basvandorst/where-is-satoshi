Online poker isn't actually banned.... payment processors are banned from processing transactions with online poker site. This is why I don't think your war on drugs analogy doesn't work. There are only a handful of payment processors and to do business in the US they must follow the law... so it is easy to keep track of them. Unlike the millions of drug dealers that would need to be tracked.
I honestly do not see why bitcoins couldn't fall into the same trap as online poker. Tomorrow, the government could say that Visa, Mastercard, Moneybookers, Western Union etc are not allowed to do businesses with bitcoin exchanges. What could people do?...

But Americans use American Credit Cards and American bank accounts to purchase bitcoins from the Japanese site.

My argument is the same as everyone else. They risked the time and money spent on setting up a mining rig. That time and money could very easily have been used to do something more profitable or fulfilling.
I agree though that people speculating on bitcoins now are also taking a risk though, and likely more of a financial risk. 
If there was 'no risk whatsoever' why didn't everybody do it?

If you can't convert those bitcoins into other currencies... is it really worth anything?

[Risk is the potential that a chosen action or activity (including the choice of inaction) will lead to a loss (an undesirable outcome). The notion implies that a choice having an influence on the outcome exists (or existed). Potential losses themselves may also be called "risks". **Almost any human endeavour carries some risk,** but some are much more risky than others.](

....there are tons of them. The US government arrested the top executives of the three largest poker sites even though all of the sites are based offshore. It was called [Black Friday](
["Prior to the indictments, the United States accounted for 25—40% the poker business for these companies.[6] For PokerStars the International business share was 70–75% and for Full Tilt it was 50–60%, according to one source.[4] Darren Rovell cites a source that says the three companies had a 95% market share in online poker in the United States.[10] Following the shut down of play in the United States, traffic was down 24%, 49%, and 45% at PokerStars, Full Tilt and Absolute, respectively."](

Isn't the choke point the actual exchange of dollars for Bitcoins?.... 
Like look what happened to online poker... The government didn't have to outlaw online poker and arrest everyone doing it... they simply made it illegal for credit card companies and payment processors to transfer money to online poker sites. If they make it illegal for payment processors to transfer to exchange sites.... I think this would kill it.

Why do they have to shutdown the exchanges?.... Why not just not allow the American Credit Card companies and American banks to do business with the exchanges?... Like they did with online poker......

You are right if a matter of days = 1 month
And a big swing = 10%
