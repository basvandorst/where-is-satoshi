I have my business account with this bank. What I can say, full of shit. Hate their customer service, always problems even to get a new debit card. Not recommended.

Are you kidding me? smartfones are like big dark hole, you even can't trust the applications from the store.

I can see general problem here. Any phone is not safe to play with crypto, android and iphone is a same shit. You can compare it which one is less secure or worst but not which one is better.
@_date: 2019-09-15 04:42:57
it's hard to disagree ;D

This is another "attack" for people who copy and paste links. What is the reason to click the link from email instead of typing it to check what is going on ? I don't understand it at all.
