I have been a huge advocate for bitcoin the last two years. From this point on it doesn't matter how revolutionary bitcoin is, anyone asking will only care that I lost my money. I'm also a developer, and right now at least, I don't feel like doing anything related to bitcoin at all.
Losing advocates doesn't harm bitcoin?

Is it just me or do they say "We employ ourselves, and **vote** with our money"?
@_date: 2015-05-01 21:08:26
Wouldn't you say there's a link between our "endless growth" economy and our inflation based monetary system? Bitcoin's deflationary model will encourage saving, not spending.
@_date: 2015-01-03 20:01:54
Credit is the promise of money, and a promise carries risk (of not getting the money), which usually increases with physical distance between merchant and creditor. So credit is not credit, and credit is not money, but money *is* money.
@_date: 2015-01-04 10:12:36
Not very much. These are also promises by your creditor, only they require a deposit. So the amount in your account goes from positive to zero, instead of from zero to negative. You usually still have the ability to cancel a purchase, which is a risk the merchant takes by accepting your card.

You seem confused ;) .. I get the sentiment though. And I agree.
Why is this post and OPs comment not focused on arguing the facts instead of ad hominem attacks on Roger Ver? As a long time bitcoin enthusiast I don't give a fuck about Roger Ver. I do however want to know how or why the article on bitcoin.com is incorrect, if that's the case.
Edit: Not my downvote btw

It's open source, and crazy smart people have been working on it since 2009. There are now more than 1000 different cryptocurrency/blockchain projects, most of which are open source.

Banning bitcoin would be just as effective as banning peer-to-peer file sharing. Unless you shut down the entire internet, it ain't going away. Sure, some people in your country may stop using it. But seeing as bitcoin and blockchain innovation in general might explode and turn into the next global monetary system, that would be monumentally stupid.
@_date: 2017-10-17 10:36:46


This was my understanding as well. This fact does not make Roger's statement false.
I'm not saying SegWit isn't the way to go. In fact it seems to be working very well and the # of segwit transactions is currently at ~13%.
My post was regarding OPs claim that the statement *"Segwit coins remove signature data from a transaction."* is a lie. However, my understanding (and yours it seems), as well as the Wikipedia page, and the BIP141 page, all seem to confirm this claim.
Removing the witness part from the transactions does not imply removing it from the block all together.

If this is a lie then somebody should probably update the Wikipedia entry for SegWit. These statements seem to support his claim:




The second statement references the [BIP141 page]( where it says (my emphasis):






For someone with just a simple understanding of SegWit, it sure sounds like Roger's description is accurate. But why isn't it?

"What is bitcoin?" .. "It's a kind of money that basically only exists on the internet".
"So the Swedish central bank has no (clue about / supervision over) bitcoin?" .. "Not the slightest, no. Nobody really has."
His explanation of mining boiled down to: You can buy a powerful computer and create your own bitcoin. .. Reporter responds: "wow, that's basically every man's dream".
"Some critics say it's a ponzi scheme and only used for buying drugs." .. "Yes it is. The whole point of the system is to make transactions secret."
He failed to mention decentralization, peer-2-peer, cryptography and any example of a positive use for bitcoin.

If your staff has smartphones they could use an address at requestbitcoin.com, type in the amount on their phone at the table, and let the customer scan the generated QR-code. The amount is converted to BTC directly via Blockchain's API.

Transaction confirmations will be implemented soon.

As for greed... Bitcoin has massive potential to change our world for the better, and I will continue to promote it's use regardless of how many bubbles burst. Helping people and fixing problems is exactly what bitcoin is about.
As for the energy... Mining and block creation is what verifies transactions and upholds the integrity of the system. If you believe in the potential benefits, this is a small price to pay.

As a Swede, my perception of the so called "black friday" in the U.S., is that people go crazy fighting each other trying to buy cheap stuff. Consumerism on crack, basically. Correct?
Isn't this at odds with what Bitcoin is about? I know we want to encourage merchant adoption, but consumption for the sake of consumption needs to stop.

Ok, maybe it's 5. Check on the back and see if 4d or 5 has a description that says "referensnummer". Anyway, they're probably just looking for a number to type into their database. You're not the first dane on Mt.Gox so if you enter the wrong one they'll likely correct it for you.

Mt.Gox seems to work better for Europeans, actually. Euro transfers usually processed in 2-4 days, both in and out. My experience at least. For 0.5 BTC localbitcoins is probably a better alternative though.

Put together a mobile site for generating QR-codes. Hopefully it's better than a static code on a piece of paper, and cheaper than a complete POS.
Using Blockchain's API for exchange rates. Only tested on iPhone and iPad so far.
@_date: 2013-11-13 21:19:16
I can see how using iPads for all POS would be less efficient. And most likely everybody wants a paper bill, regardless of payment method.
I don't know anything about Micro, but I don't see why handling bitcoin would be any different from handling cash in your system. You simply register that the amount has been paid, but instead of receiving cash you receive bitcoin. To keep track of dollar amounts paid in bitcoin (in case of split bill for example), staff could just take a screendump of the QR-code page. These could be emailed, printed out, easily verified and counted with the cash. Which means staff could use personal devices. Perhaps I'm oversimplifying? Just thinking out loud here.

Is it your intention that the design flips vertically between front &amp; back, and not horizontally? If not, the flap should be on the left side on the back.

This requires a normal text input instead of a numeric one that's in html5. The new number type brings up the numeric keypad in iOS, so likely no apps or websites will support that going forward. Better to display &amp; input all BTC in milli or mikro in that case.

Your assumption here is that the reserve ratio is fairly constant, which is false. FRB creates inflation/deflation as a result of people and businesses taking more/less loans, which is dependent on the willingness of both parties; banks and loan takers.
Without QE reserves may be constant, but loans are not. QE doesn't work if people and businesses aren't willing to take loans. Which is why they keep lowering the interest rates.
By increasing and decreasing the money supply via loans, FRB basically makes our economy dependent on the good faith of bankers, and the psychology of loan takers.

This article is misleading. Skatterättsnämnden gave a preliminary decision that there would be no VAT for purchase of bitcoins or the service of exchanging bitcoins. Skatteverket has now appealed the service case, saying that any exchange fees should have VAT since bitcoins aren't legal tender. Christian Ander from btcx.se says they won't be affected by this since they don't take any exchange fees.

How do they handle cash tip, is it registered in the system or separated? If the bitcoin transaction includes 20% tip, the email receipts need to be linked to the employee. If the employee is the sender there's no issue. But if it's a general transaction using Bitpay I suppose the employee's name or ID will have to be noted somehow. Most likely they have support for this.
Another option would be to create a separate tipping address for each employee (if they don't have their own). They could leave a card with the QR-code and a nice message together with the bill. The business owner could buy their bitcoin at the end of the day/week if they want USD instead.
