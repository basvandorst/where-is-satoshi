I know. Bitcoin was promoted as a currency that can be used to pay any kind of amount, even 0.00000001 if you like. But if you pay fees like this it's not suitable for small amounts anymore. Costs more than normal payment methods, which was another promotion point of bitcoin "low fees".

Thanks for the info, I used the recommended transaction fee by blockchain.info. Guess I have to adjust that manually from now on. Will SegWit fix issues like this? Transactions never cost that much back then. It's just 10€. I really don't like paying 50 cent fee to send 10€.
