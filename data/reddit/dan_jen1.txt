This. Nobody made people buy at $19k. A meteoric rise overnight to an ATH and people thought it a good strategy to dump their life savings in so they could get rich quick. I do not feel sorry for them. It’s Bitcoin not Lambo coin. Ultimately you’re responsible for your money and your choices.

1.	No exchange needed
2.	Maybe. Are you sending fiat or Bitcoin?
3.	Same as 
Exchanges do literally that. Exchange what you have into something else. Bitcoin to fiat or Bitcoin to Ethereum for example. If you’re transacting using Bitcoin then there’s no exchange needed.

Since were taking requests I’m not paid again until Thursday. Thanks!

Could be.  Do you need a hug?

“It’s MURDA!”
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:23:39
“I wish...” would probably be more accurate. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:53:52
Agreed. It’s ugly as shit but works well.

Use Blockchain and scanned address from Electrum  wallet. (just don’t transfer the private keys into Blockchain). 
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:59:38
I disagree. 50% chance it isn’t coming. Lol

I’m asking the same question and watching it go to $7650. Now $7200 isn’t looking so bad. It’s gotta correct a little, guys right?  
@_date: 2017-11-18 20:45:01
Yeah its pretty easy. Lots of guides out there on how to do it. Login to GDAX and deposit from your Coinbase account. Then withdraw from that account to your segwit wallet. Electrum’s website has a thorough walk through on how to make a wallet.

Welcome to the club.  I get to buy more tomorrow, hoping for a little bit more of a dip.  Buying under $7k sounds nice. Which means it'll probably be an ATH, cuz my luck. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:50:02
I have some funds in Bittrex. Haven’t had any issue.

You need to put your shit in your wallet. Not Coinbase. This link has details pros / cons and specifics. I’d recommend Electrum. Ugly as shit but works well. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:44:41
I was pissed I didn’t get into bitcoin sooner and have been putting a couple bucks in here and there at $5k up to $6500. I’m looking forward to buying more at a bargain. Zoom out, don’t invest what you can’t lose and everyone STFU nobody knows what’s gonna happen next. Other than that. Great points. I appreciate your insight.

Nothing I can think of....moving the money between them and writing down a new seed.  Hearing my wife say “how many fucking wallets do we need?”  I’ll have her call you as your setting yours up. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 06:53:41
Electrum. Not pretty, works well. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:25:52
I buy on Friday's when I get paid.  Sometimes the price is higher then it's been, sometimes it's not and the world is ending.  My wife and I have speculated that Bitcoin will be worth well in excess of what it's worth currently.  Buying as much as we can when we can and riding the roller coaster.  See you on the moon!

I use Electrum. Make sure to set it up as a segwit wallet. You don’t own your bitcoin if you don’t have your private keys. You’re basically just using Coinbase’s wallet.  Move your Bitcoin to Coinbase’s exchange. GDAX and from their it’s $0 to send to your new Segwit wallet in Electrum.

Difficulty change coming up...batton down the hatches, buy the dips and HODL!

This friend of mine spent thousands on something he doesn’t even know how to cash out of. Fucking great. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:37:52
Here’s a good run down 
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:22:07
Here ya go just read this and you decide. I recommend Electrum but you can choose whatever you want. Even make your own, if you want. That’s why this shit is cool.
