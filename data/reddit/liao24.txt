But that's sending from Gdax not trans with cash into usd wallet on coinbase

Yeah he said he didn't see the message so I have no idea how long it will take for him. Another question, does a higher amount take more time?
@_date: 2019-07-22 06:38:06
But holding the 12 year old on the left is illegal..
@_date: 2017-12-31 22:07:45
Oh okay, thank you all it is the withdraw option... I'm just too use to other exchanges with the send button. I will try it soon, thank you all once again!
@_date: 2017-12-31 21:41:40
I guess that's the problem, I do not see a send button at all. I just see buy, sell, transfer and settings. Sorry, I feel embarrassed.

Yup so dumb that he's a billionaire. Wow he's a human being and not a saint. I'm shocked.
@_date: 2019-06-11 19:28:50
Yup Warren Buffet is dumb..
@_date: 2019-06-11 20:11:44
Yup he got rich from being dumb..Lol okay autistic hive minded monkey.
@_date: 2019-06-11 19:14:44
Lol triggered. Yes it is okay, you're no saint yourself. Look at the CEO of Cola and McD you honestly think they're innocent? Ignore big businesses, even some small businesses are messed up from unethical ways of making money.
And yes you guys are hurting people with your pump and dump lol all those poor millennials have yet to break even so don't give me that bullshit. People on this sub are delusional. Wake up.

So? You don't get to where he is by holding the door for everyone, have you seen the list for other companies? Just as much allegations. Plus 99% of people that support cryptocurrency is because of greed that one day they'll be filthy rich.
@_date: 2019-06-11 19:24:07
Lol haven't you realised most people here have hive minds like a cultist. And the rest just wanna be rich. And you made valid points and which is why no one will use cryptocurrency besides the a very small population.
@_date: 2019-06-11 19:54:54
Lol you just contracted yourself. The most low effort autistics come back, I lost IQ reading that. Bye.
@_date: 2019-06-11 18:13:58
Any proof for these accusations other than the fact he spoked poorly on cryptocurrency like Buffett?
@_date: 2019-01-11 07:53:28
This isn't a stock, it has no fundamentals backing it up. Stop quoting things that don't apply. I'm not on the sidelines, do not assume my assets, just not huge in crypto. This whole thing is a speculation. One bubble after another should tell you such.
@_date: 2019-01-11 13:41:27
Most autistic comeback. Can't even voice yourself.
@_date: 2019-01-11 05:44:33
Not if you're trying to follow patterns of a past chart, that's just gambling.

You mad baghodling bro?
@_date: 2019-01-11 19:18:20
Does that make you the idiot?
@_date: 2019-01-11 01:56:02
Past actions do not dictate future results.
@_date: 2019-01-11 16:59:22
Lol not as much as you bag holding shitcoins from 19.5k
@_date: 2018-12-17 08:58:34
If you plant rice now it will not grow, wait until mid april and prosper you will reap.

I hope he swings 10 more times, bringing it to 50k then breaks the swing.
