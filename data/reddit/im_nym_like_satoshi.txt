how is the lightning network a viable response to scaling when it doesn't exist and we don't know if/when it will exist nor if/when it will be successfully integrated into the user base/network?
@_date: 2015-06-22 00:14:42
nonsense. you can have a different trust model. people can make reasonable trade-offs depending on ease of use vs. security. promoting one-size-fits-all is a bit ridiculous.

one problem is there is no mechanism to upgrade your transaction. there is a proposal floating around for a replace-by-fee feature which allows you to add more fees to your transaction. for some unknown reason the first more destructive version of the patch was put forward but there is a safe version which means you have to create the new transaction paying to the same people your first transaction paid to in order for it to be accepted.
then the next problem is wallets aren't ready to support this nor fee estimation yet. bitcoin-qt may do a good job of fee estimation now but it is not the preferred wallet. to do good estimation you need a complete view of the network which only a full node can provide. i think it would make sense to add logic to bitcoin nodes that allow SPV users who wish to trust it the ability to see what the fees required would be for various thresholds of confirmation. but afaik this doesn't exist yet either.
as i understand it there is space in blocks miners reserve for free transactions but empirically it seems more common for non-fee paying transactions to languish unconfirmed for many hours.
to directly answer your question: yes i think this makes sense but you must also be practical. this will all take time and the downside is (potentially) the bitcoin user experience gets much worse before it gets better and it greatly hinders mainstream adoption. and yes, part of the appeal to mainstream is reduced fees. whether that is sane long-term is very questionable. anyone pretending to know the answer should be looked at with skepticism imo. it may seem like gavin is going against the status quo but in fact he seems more aligned with it given there is no fee pressure now and his change will keep fee pressure low for at least awhile longer. but please don't take this as technical endorsement of it as i am not qualified to endorse it.

i think current bitcoin-qt wallet actually has some clever fee estimation logic based on network behavior but it is relatively untested due to no fee pressure. i don't really know details only remember reading about it sometime ago.

where did i demand anything? not everyone wants or is competent enough to run a full node at home so making that a requirement is kind of silly i think. but i do agree people should be able to run one at home if they want to and feel comfortable. bounds on block size should respect this desired usage imo. after all it is the most decentralized.
**edit**: lol i realize my choice of phrase may be interpreted by some more literally than others. i really would like one-size-to-fit-all (with respect to block size) usage patterns, but i don't think we should require everyone be a full node. hopefully that made sense?
@_date: 2015-06-27 22:09:53
The sentence immediately preceding that one seems a bit more interesting maybe: **"Only people trying to create new coins would need to run network nodes."** [source](
**edit**: based on my reading of this email and other messages from him/her it seems like their vision was that the incentive to run a full node (in modern parlance) was that it could be used for mining. and mining new coins (and eventually fees) would be the reward. if fees are ever to be enough of a reward and still allow for a practical system the size of the blocks must grow significantly as must the user base. i have a hard time seeing this as contestable. it is also clear satoshi intended for organizations/groups to offer connections to nodes for use with light clients and these light clients would make up the majority of the user base. this is completely consistent with modern internet consumption, e.g. ipads and phones are becoming more preferred to even owning a computer. having the system be completely trustless/perfectly decentralized does not appear to be the point. global consensus was to be decentralized enough such that no single government/adversary could shut it down and the system would scale by also relying on somewhat localized trust to some degree and Moore's law/observation. hubs, spokes, lions, lightning, tigers and bears never seemed part of the plan.
@_date: 2015-06-25 16:21:44
yes. you can use [pay-to-pubkey script]( in your signature if you want. I doubt most wallets support it anymore though. nothing really wrong with it. makes the UTXO set size a bit bigger if everyone used it.
@_date: 2015-06-27 22:06:16
i think one issue is when that quote was made a node/miner/wallet were all synonymous. i think the quote is more about mining nodes than about running a node as a wallet or a fully participating client based on the specialized hardware comment.
**edit**: yes here is the sentence that immediately precedes this: "Only people trying to create new coins would need to run network nodes." [source]( This actually seems more damning to the "everyone needs to run a full node" argument...
@_date: 2015-06-22 01:17:27
right i agree. i wasn't responding to the "servers are cheap enough" argument and only commenting on a full node as the only proper way to use the system. i think people running full nodes at home will be very rare honestly, but even if it's 1% of the user base we shouldn't just tell them tough luck now this is too big for you. we should always think about realistic residential bandwidth and retail hardware costs when deciding any limits.

i've only heard of like some lab at ucsb building one that can crack rsa but low bit keys i think. just proof-of-concept maybe. for some reason i think it lends itself better to prime factorization than reversing curve dotting but i dont know maths or physics. 
**edit**: yeah this is the [shit]( i read. i guess it can crack the shit out of 15. super low bit.

he's not crying. i think he's earnest in his beliefs but the passion for the project often leads to an emotional response. please, if we want to resolve this we can't attack people. he's a brilliant man and he came up with an amazing tool. we need to work with guys like this not make enemies out of them. at the end of the day we are all on the same side. we want bitcoin to grow and work well!
@_date: 2015-06-25 18:50:09
yeah but i think the security of that is questionable value. if ecdsa over secp256k1 is busted before block chain sees it coming, fuck it. shits fucked anyway.

i hope it's not in-memory. if your LN node crashes/reboots you'd probably have a really big mess on your hands.

this sounds like the beginning of reasonable compromise.
@_date: 2015-06-29 00:01:16
i agree with everything you just said. i further appreciate you acquiescing to a small raise in the block size to give ideas like this more time to mature and perhaps become realized as a significant and production-tested means of achieving more scale.
@_date: 2015-06-21 23:26:27
security is one issue but there's also UX to think about as hub operator. if your hub sucks no one will use it.

he rejected on the grounds that he didn't want the BIP arbiter to be him. this seems reasonable as skill-set of project maintainer may not be aligned with such a role. i think your plan made sense. IMO u should make PR to change the BIP and see where the process goes.

blockstream wants control
@_date: 2015-07-04 18:08:59
spv wallets don't trust mining for validating they each trust a subset of full nodes to validate.

there's definitely tons of ridiculous shenanigans going on but bip66 was known/planned for a long time.  
@_date: 2015-07-04 19:19:59
they connect to nodes. if these nodes are validating blocks the miners could be pumping out invalid blocks 10 at a time and it doesn't matter as they won't get to the spv client. useful or not that's an accurate description.
they trust the difficulty to indicate *someone* was performing a lot of work to produce a block which mitigates intentional fraud. in this specific instance spv clients were just as broken as full nodes that didn't acknowledge the soft-fork.
@_date: 2015-07-04 18:17:01
unless they've saved way more money and will continue to with their continued use of this optimization. there is much less risk to them outside of this soft-fork cutover period. this isn't going to stop any of them from continuing to do this.
@_date: 2015-07-03 18:47:12
i still don't understand the concern and never replied to me on the [list]( is it that a block relayed to an SPV user may have valid headers/difficulty but contains fraudulent transactions? can't the SPV client simply cross-check the block header with any other node and/or peer with a node in its same legal jurisdiction such that if it's complicit in fraud the standard legal world can take over?
@_date: 2015-08-03 01:50:45

@_date: 2015-07-03 19:10:03
ok that concern seems not altogether significant as i suspected. i think we need to remember it's clear this system was built to be decentralized *enough* but for some reason that seems to conflict with the present narrative -- or rather the present narrative conflicts with this fact.
