What about mSIGNA? I believe it fulfills all of OP's requirements. I've started to use it and it seems ok so far. Any opinions?

Maybe circle or celery have lower fees (you'd have to check).
Also, they are not wallets. They are the merchants that sell you bitcoin for fiat, that also happen to keep the private keys to your bitcoin for you. (It might be wise to transfer your bitcoin from there to a real wallet that you actally control).

Well, yes, you could say they are in a bitcoin wallet, but the catch is that it is a wallet that you don't have direct control of. They control the private keys to that wallet. And they allow you access to your bitcoin for now. They could block you at any time, for any reason. Say for example that their website goes down for a while. You cannot access your bitcoin until they come back up. Or if they get hacked and all the bitcoins are stolen and they go bankrupt or something (unlikely, of course, but it could happen). Or that they get a court order to put an embargo on your bitcoin or something like that (again, unlikely and farfetched, but a possibility). It kind of defeats the purpose of bitcoin.

Xoom.com would have been another (worse, of course) option. I am in a similar situation (WF savings account) and before bitcoin, xoom was my main (and probably only) way of withdrawing the money.
@_date: 2014-09-30 01:02:35
Thanks for the heads up. What's "lots of transactions"? I'd also love to know what their reasons for locking my coins out could be. I currently hold no balance with them (I recently bought, so I'm waiting to receive a few, but I usually move them out right away).

Yes, that's what it means. You send $1.40 (which is "free" for you), but it's not free for her. Your PayPal friends keep that extra $0.40.

Coinbase didn't require an SSN. I linked my account and started buying bitcoin right away.

I'm not so sure that businesses will *always* convert. They might convert for a while, but maybe they'll gradually convert less and less. So, I believe it could be a step in the right direction anyway.
Of course I cannot know for sure, only time will tell. :)

Oh, ok. I seriously did not know that 9/11 was called Patriot. Anyway, I opened my account post-Patriot then.
@_date: 2014-10-07 04:54:49
Probably doesn't qualify as 'heartily', but I bought another 0.5 BTC at 299. :)

It was a few years ago, I went to the bank branch, gave them my passport, deposited $300 with an international CC (from my local non-US bank) and that was it. :)
@_date: 2014-09-29 16:32:35
Well, Argentina is "special" in this regard. So I don't have my hopes too high. :(
@_date: 2014-09-29 16:20:11
Probably. I have no idea what Patriot or pre-Patriot is. I opened that bank account in August 2004. :)
@_date: 2014-08-25 18:08:09
Where does Coinbase get the BTC to sell them to me? Could they ever be 'out of stock'? (Does this question make any sense? Why?)
Thanks! :)
@_date: 2014-09-29 14:58:37
Bad luck for me. They ask for an SSN to link my US bank account, and I don't have an SSN. I'm stuck with Coinbase. :(
@_date: 2014-11-23 22:00:26
Paypal is the middleman even when both parties deal with the same currency (us dollars). With bitcoin you cut the middleman if you get paid for your what you do in bitcoin and pay in bitcoin to your suppliers/employees. But if for some reason you need to convert it to a different currency, then you need a service provider that will do this for you (Bitpay, or Coinbase).
@_date: 2014-09-30 05:49:52
Got it. Thanks for the clarification.
@_date: 2014-09-29 16:04:26
They answered the email I sent to support. They said my local bank sent back a "Do not honor" code and blocked the transaction. I will try again later anyway, thanks.
@_date: 2014-08-25 19:11:27
Thanks for your answer, it makes sense now.
As for competition, there's Celery, which sells to you (they have more expensive rates than coinbase) but they don't buy from you.
Of course, a few more players would be great.
Btw, I'll look for those threads. Thanks again. :)

Probably different fee calculation algorithms used for sending than for returning. That would be my guess.
@_date: 2017-08-04 04:10:36
This is how I did it: Once the fork had passed, I moved my bitcoin from my wallet (wallet A) to a different bitcoin wallet (wallet B). Then I installed "electron cash" (a bcash wallet) and did a restore with the seed from wallet A (this wallet still had the bcash "hidden"). So I now had my bitcoins in wallet B and my bcash in the electron cash wallet. (Then I sent the bcash to hitbtc and sold there for more bitcoin which I then sent back to wallet B, but that step is optional).
@_date: 2017-08-02 21:05:09
Thanks. I'm certain it's following the bcash chain, but still that last transaction appears as unconfirmed. :/
@_date: 2017-08-04 02:00:09
If you withdrew before the fork to a wallet where you have the private keys, then you can access your BCH right now, no need to wait til next year.

@_date: 2017-08-02 17:28:22
I had my bitcoin in electrum too. I really can't say how electron cash is working because I haven't really tried it. I just restored from seed and haven't actually done anything else with it.
@_date: 2017-08-02 17:25:58
Oh, it hasn't happened to me yet, but you give me hope, thanks.
@_date: 2017-08-09 20:07:29
The key is to have had the BTC in CB all through the fork (from before up to after). If you had them before the fork and sold them after the fork, they should give you the corresponding bcash. No matter if you currently have 0.00 BTC there because you transferred, moved or sold. You should get the bcash. :)
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:24:20
Yes. But would be more expensive every month. It's a VPS. My internet connection at home is about 1Mbps. :'(
@_date: 2017-08-02 22:19:53
I restarted electron cash and the bad transaction is gone! :D
Maybe it makes sense to add it as a side note somewhere on the guide? To restart if this happens. :)
Edit: OMG I made a transaction in BCH to the exchange and it worked! :D  Dump incoming...
@_date: 2017-08-04 02:09:37
This. They're probably doing this. It's genius.

@_date: 2017-08-04 01:58:41
If you had a BTC balance at CB before the fork and you moved it away after the fork, then they should give you the corresponding BCH.
@_date: 2017-08-02 16:54:08
I got the bcash on electron cash, but there are two transactions, the old one where I got 100% of my BTC in confirmed in bcash, and an unconfirmed transaction from my electrum wallet from when I emptied it to a new one before, but unconfirmed, so electron cash does not let me spend the bcash, because the balance is zero (because of that last unconfirmed transaction).
Any ideas on how to spend the bcash? Just wait ages until that transaction goes away? "Double spend" it in some way?
@_date: 2017-08-02 18:07:02
It synced the blockchain in a few minutes and then all transactions showed up pretty quickly. Including one last unconfirmed transaction. The one that I used to empty the bitcoin from the electrum side before restoring from that seed in electron cash. So, if I get that unconfirmed (invalid for bcash) transaction, then I would have my full balance of bcash.

@_date: 2017-08-04 04:52:35
Awesome. Glad it's working for you.
I actually had a similar issue with electron cash. I had to restart it after syncing so that it would let me spend the bcash. But it worked fine afterwards. :)

Hi! I'm sorry, I did not follow a guide to do it. Bitcoin cash was pretty new back then, so as far as I know there weren't any guides. But maybe there are now, I haven't looked. Good luck! :)

@_date: 2015-10-10 17:47:06
I agree with you on that, I really hate the limits and restrictions on my btc. But it's a convenient way to trade a little.
@_date: 2015-10-10 19:44:00
I think their value proposition is that if you normally "think" in fiat, then when you buy BTC, you know you now have BTC, but you still feel you have, say $245 per BTC at that time. So if BTC price then drops, you feel you lost money. So they let you deposit BTC and then "sell" it for fiat, so if you normally "think" in fiat, you'd actually have $245/BTC all the time, no matter the price changes. And also, I think they imply it's more convenient than real fiat because it's based upon bitcoin, and it's bitcoin-only if you want out.
I don't really see it that way myself, but I find interesting the concept of "we shield you from volatility". So I buy that slogan and I choose to be shielded from volatility only when price goes down. I don't want to be shielded from volatility when price goes up, so that's my use case.
I do agree with you on the fact that I still feel there's something else that I'm missing about this service but I don't know what it is just yet.

Thanks, I'll look into it!
Actually it's not that I prefer fiat, I was using bitreserve just to trade (as in "move from btc to fiat when I think btc price is going down" and the opposite).
@_date: 2015-10-12 17:53:49
Well, I really hope you're wrong on this. When registering, there's these "terms and conditions" and policies and legal shit, that actually says that it's your own money and that they are protecting it and all. But of course, IANAL, and all those things they say might be useless. I can't really know for sure.
I understand your point though. In practice, I gave them the BTC, they have the private keys (I only hope they honor their policies and protections and all that though).
