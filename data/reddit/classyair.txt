If someone gets your bank login credentials, you'll get your money back. If  someone gets your private key, your coins are gone forever. This is one of the things that makes bitcoin so difficult to use, namely securing your wallet.

Yes! If I put my money in a bank account, I can be sure that I will always have that money. If the bank gets hacked, or even if they become insolvent, I will still be able to withdraw all of my money. They are legally obligated to pay their depositors. 
On the other hand, If my trezor wallet gets stolen, or if my computer is stolen, or if malware steals my private key, I am fucked. There is no way I can get my stasoshis back unless the current owner of them decides to give them to me.
This is the advantage that the so-called "fiat system" has over Bitcoin: That you can put the security of your money into the hands of someone who is more capable of keeping your money safe than you are. Instead of burying your cash in the backyard, you can save it in a bank.
PS: Don't take this the message the wrong way, *I THINK BITCOIN IS AN AWESOME IDEA*, but it is NOT something that can replace the regular fiat banking system for the average person, at least not in its current incarnation. The average person would rather not have to secure their own money, but instead trust in another entity (a bank) that has the resources to keep their money safe and allow them to conveniently use it any time they want (via debit cards and ATMs).
