Nowadays most websites for publications display content based on their user's reading habits. Be that in the form of widgets, front page stories, suggested articles, or whatever. As you're proving if the user is served links to things they're interested in they are more likely to view multiple pages, and since publications are primarily funded by impressions choosing not to do it is just them leaving money on the table.

For that past fifteen years they've eliminated independent news media through buyouts, sham trials resulting in prison time, and public assassinations of human rights activists without political or legal recourse. Anything that has the potential of taking away power from the Kremlin gets nationalized or methodically destroyed brick-by-brick. If a virtual currency represents such a threat ISPs will meet the same fate as independent news media and big oil.
What do: [A prominent lawyer shot in the back of the head on a busy Moscow street in broad daylight]( [a world renowned human rights journalists assassinated in hotel lobby]( and an [ex-KGB poisoned in the United Kingdom have in common]( They all spoke up about the human rights abuses in the North Caucasus which spoiled public support with Russia for the Chechen Wars, so each one of them met a grisly fate with not a single person going to jail for their brazen murderers. There's no reason to expect that owners/operators of exchanges and the journalists who cover virtual currencies wont meet the fate for in adoption takes off.

Realistically speaking the absolute minimum you can put down an expect a return within a year is roughly $4,000 to $6,000.

Well, payment processors are financial institutions, and as such are subject to the regulation of their customer's government. Enforcing a ban on electronic payment processing is as close being built into the system as it gets. Which basically would eliminate all the modern convenience of purchasing BitCoin or exchanging it for legal tender. Getting in would involve having a physical cash exchange and getting out you've got two options: buy FIAT from some other country and wire it back to your account using the brick-and-mortar banking system or finding a cash buyer in person.
TL;DR: Any ban on BitCoins would be enforced similarly to economic sanctions on a rogue state, but that would not stop the usage of BitCoins completely, just destroy the valuation by eliminating the FX market.

I really don't think its fair to pass judgement one way or another so quickly, but for the time being ZeroNet is really just a working proof-of-concept. Right now its more or less a decentralized Intranet than anything else. Which while interesting and kind of cool is pretty restrictive in terms of what you can produce.
However, in the event that Kim Dotcom clones ZeroNet what's going to really separate the two wont necessarily be the marketing. While I'll readily admit creating software has its challenges maintaining and extending it is much more difficult. With Kim's experience and abilities to raise capital he'd have the advantage.
Another thing worth point out is the author of the open-source project is from Hungary. Where a fascist party (Fidesz) won in 2010, immediately tore up the constitution to rebalance power sharing in favor of the ruling party and limit the role of courts, and most recently they proposed an Internet tax that has been shelved for the time being after protest. Which effectively means they no longer have job security so long as they remain in Budapest and moreover the country. This project could very easily be their ticket out, and on their way to doubling or tripling their current salary. If that happened they'd likely have to very little time to spare for ZeroNet.

For periods of growth an average has more merit than years of perpetual decline.

That's basically what the BitCoin mining community does or at least the influx of miners anyways. A little macroeconomics here, a dash of supply and demand, and some arbitrage over there.
The delightful irony of miners hording BitCoins is that they're no different from Goldman Sachs, Bank of American, etc. In that merchants can't make their back the cost of developing a BTC payment system from BTC, so they just rag-tag something together for easy publicity. I mean, when was the last time you trusted something worth $100 that's sale price was 5? Inflation is a necessary evil, we trust larger numbers more than small ones.

That'd be true if BitCoin were commodity which it is not. The value of a currency is determined by several dynamic metrics the key ones are: trust, market ecosystem, and popularity. BitCoin popped because of the anonymity/security appeal, so until the current trust issues are professionally resolved the value will just keep dropping.
Last week BitCoin's market was valued at something like 173M, yet there's less than a hundred shops that accept the currency. None of which are killing it by the way. For the price of BitCoin to stabilize there needs to be a much stronger focus on getting businesses to accept the currency. Because building trust isn't just a security thing. You can do it by building off the trust people have with stores they do business with, non-profits they donate money to, or even just word of mouth. Businesses and non-profts have the added bonus of potentially bringing in a whole new flock of adopters too.

His analysis is pretty nonexistent, but there are triggers you can look at to gauge the odds of something happening. For example, with projects that gain exposure through social media there's no real appetite for being socially incompetent. Which is a difficult thing to address because contrary to popular belief social traffic comes in a series of waves that together equal a lot of traffic and not a flash crash of traffic. Therefor if you want to capitalize on it you can't manage the project your own time. Otherwise the project either fails spectacularly, or it goes right back into obscurity with the tarnished image in-hand.
Some other triggers include: community growth, community defensiveness, community outreach, news sources, professionalism, pace first - and - third-party of development, and the education demographic.


The problem with that argument is public perception of the BitCoin and security largely isn't good. Remember during the social media pop how quickly the story turned from, "This is awesome." to "Oh shit, the largest exchange got hacked?" People who've got the money and the investing skills remember that shit like an elephant.

No it's not, look at year-over-year numbers. 
Also, why would you get into BitCoin now? We've been in a downward trend for a month with absolutely no indications showing that's going to change. BitCoin news is almost entirely generate in-house, the community's growth-rate is back to pre-media-blitz levels, thanks to security flops public perception of the currency is largely negative, and there's still no BitCoin economy to support the price of the currency.
Most things don't make the rounds more than once, and with the advent of a developed social media the stakes are much higher. Since social media has become much more populist and centralized over the past couple years. It can make topics so popular so quickly that any story with little reporting becomes a traffic free-for-all for media outlets. If the topic, in this case the BitCoin project, wants to set it's own pace they almost always fade away. 
The only real difference between the game Ace of Spades(Minecraft with guns) and BitCoin is that people invested money into BitCoin. Unfortunately most of those people did it for their own self-enrichment rather than trying to develop the community into a proper economy. As a result we've got mostly miners, shorts, traders, and businesses looking for easy media exposure. Instead of trying to create a pro-developer atmosphere with clear incentives to partake in it. Someone's gotta use those coins for them to be worth anything.

Hungary's current government ran a campaign on the idea that the "gypsy crime" resulted in the current recession, and pointed to the fact that their living standards didn't dip as proof. They won in a complete landslide, rewrote the constitution and stripped the judicial system of it's power in early April. Despite the fact that the majority of Romani are so impoverished that a dip in their living standards is simply starvation.
It isn't just Hungary that's done that either. France did the same thing, and last summer ramped up deportations of the Romani to Romania regardless of their place of origin. The current German government tried to quietly do the same for Kosovar Romani refugees living in Germany. Which they took in because groups like the KLA were indiscriminately slaughtering, raping, torturing, etc. entire Romani villages for being, "Serb collaborators" in the 90s. Thankfully Der Spiegel stepped up to the plate to make sure that didn't happen.
Up until WW2 if the Jews were being scapegoated so were the Roma. Now that they can't explicitly blame Jews for economic problems in Europe they blame the "Gypsy Crime". If not the Roma, the Turks. If not the Turks, the Arabs. They always find a new immigrant group to blame they problems on. That's just how it is. Whenever economic turmoil hits they go right back to Colonialist policies.
A new age of social enlightenment is the only thing that's going to solve that problem.

China made it illegal for financial institutions: banks, investment groups, payment processors, etc. to exchange legal tender for BitCoins. Meaning businesses cannot freely exchange their coins for Yuan like they could before, and pushed doing business with the currency into a legal grey-area. Which isn't exactly a place you want to operating in given the country's lack of fair trials and record of publicly executing business people regardless of fame.
If you're into BitCoin because its been treated as a speculative commodity with prices rising, "to the moon" than this is the worst possible news. These rules have effectively ended the Yuan-BitCoin foreign exchange market indefinitely, and forced all purchases of currency with legal tender to be done in physical cash money with no middle-man. Countries that have restrictive monetary policies are the growth engines for digital currencies. Not sure if you heard but the largest one is no longer in play. There's no reason other countries can't follow suit.

In other words, all Chinese businesses and citizens alike have to find cash buyers if they want to exchange it back into Yuan. Which unlike the United States is fairly difficult to do because the supply of the Chinese currency is strictly controlled. While technically legal they could just buy gold or some other commodity and resell it for Yuan. However, do you really want to play the grey-area in China? Where fair trials aren't a thing, and CEOs get executed by firing squad for corruption.

Contrary to popular assumption just because you use TOR, proxies, etc. doesn't mean you're untraceable. Rather its actually fairly simple for governments if you use the same machine for your daily usage. Because third-party browser plugins such as but not limited to: Flash, Java, and SilverLight implement their own proprietary local storage files. Colloquially they're referred to as cookies albeit an incorrect definition. Aside from HTTP cookies no browser has the permissions necessary to disable them, and often times the plugin authors do not implement the function properly either.
Basically how tracer, "cookies" work is from the first time you view one of their embedded advertisements they issue you an unique ID, and each time your browser loads one of their ads they grab data like the geo-location, site names, IP, time stamp, etc. Essentially they're using cookies to cache that information rather than updating their database constantly. Providing them with a robust profile your machine's browsing habits regardless if you delete them regularly. BitCoin isn't associated with any legal entity by default, but either your machine or the ones on the network you're connected to have robust profiles associated with them. Whittling it all down may tie up too many resources to bother with low-level drug offenses. Screwing the government out of money however? That's another story. 
While I'm no defender of BitCoin I've got to say it sucks to launder. If you've got a pile of cash in your bedroom it's not networked into anything. It's just pieces of paper in a room. As where any computer connected to the Internet has a million ways of being surveyed.

There are players with enough BitCoins and fiat to effectively manipulate the market e.g. early adopters, hackers, hedge fund managers, money launders, etc. After they take their profits they use bots to flood the exchanges with thousands of micro-transactions to force the price lower. Whenever their algorithms determine a bottom has been reached they stop selling and begin buying huge orders. 
It's a dangerous game because if the masses get spooked the price wont rebound and it will accelerate into a multi-day or week crash. That hasn't happened yet, but the higher the exchange rate become the more likely that it will. Because there's a real difference between BTC losing 30% of it's value at $265 and $70 or $50. That's the difference between a dinner at a nice place and food for the week.

Except no, while BitCoin can be used as a payment system there genuinely hasn't been a usage increase to justify the spike in evaluation, so there's not much technical data to support the idea of the hike in exchange rates being driven by something other than outright speculation. Given the sure amount of money being poured into the exchange you've got wonder how much of the trade volume has been from Chinese financial institutions. 
What's unclear about this statement is what happens to the BitCoins they already own. If they cannot trade or hold them the government effectively just confiscated their wallets, and all the trading volume they've accounted for has been eliminated indefinitely. Depending on how this plays out the Chinese government could wind up owning a large share of the BitCoins in circulation. Also, if they expand regulations to manufacturing all those ASIC miner chips are going to have to find a new place to be made.

Mt.Gox is learning on-the-fly. Back in 2011 they didn't have any xss protection and the DB was practically totally unencrypted. Hopefully they've got some guys that know what they're doing, but it's taken them over an hour just to say, "Yeah guys, more trades than what we expected."? Like suddenly after weeks of a crazy rally it just got too crazy to handle. Even if that's the case and these places have suddenly shutdown they had plenty of time to get a contingency plan hammered out.

You're comparing apples to oranges. Exchange rates of state-backed currencies do not move more than 3-4% annually unless the central bank is making aggressive changes in monetary policy, and the millisecond-by-millisecond moves in FX markets in no way directly effect the consumers purchasing power. As where just this week BitCoin rose sharply to over 1000USD at one point, flash crashed half of it's value, and "settled" the week being up 75%. The penalties of this payment system are inverse that of a traditional one. Rather than the purchaser paying a tax(or fee as you say) the recipient makes a gamble as the value of the transaction cannot be guaranteed. Contrasting that to e-mail where the service provider simply did away with fees in favor of a new monetization method.

No, they said financial institutions i.e. banks, investment groups, payment processors, etc. are not free to exchange or hold it as a currency, and all businesses accepting BitCoins as payment have to file with the state telecommunications regulatory administration. The latter of which requires manual approval.

That's because you based your prediction on absolutely nothing. Anybody can just make a wild claim and have it come true, but that isn't so much vindication as it is blind luck. Personally, I do not feel BitCoin has long-term stability at this price, nor does Goog north of 1000, the 52-week rally without a correction in the Nasdaq wont last for another, or that Abeonomics will be in play going forward unless employers start hiking wages.
Markets that go parabolic as was the case with gold in the 1980s, tech stocks in the early 2000s, and BitCoin after its breakout all crash violently. From an investment/stock trading perspective its not a game of philosophical debate so much as it is one of trying to bank the most points before the buzzer. Having BTC exchanges once again go parabolic isn't a sign of a revolution, so much as it is an entrance into a really dangerous phase for any market. In my humble opinion this one has the power to do more long-term damage to BitCoin than any other. Because we're paring a parabolic rise in the exchange rate with: tech stocks in the largest exchange having rose 40% without a correction and uncertainty in Bank of Japan and US Federal Reserve policy. The same investors who're pouring cash into stocks and start-ups are putting it in BTC too, and if shit hits the fan they're going to pull the plug on their most risky investments first.

Thing is, the overwhelming volume of folks use it as a get-rich-quick scheme, and the development over the past two years in a communal and technical sense perfectly reflects that. Like always this huge influx of media attention will bring massive embarrassment when the bubble bursts.
You know how many people make fan pages for other currencies? Nobody. Because when you put your money in cash you don't expect the value to change drastically. That's the whole point of the saying, "I got out and put my money in cash." BitCoin hasn't been acting like a currency since last year ended. Money wouldn't have taken off if every time you checked shit cost a different amount. People would've just stuck with bartering. Baring some natural disaster or rare event the chicken:bread rate would always be the same.

They're most easily identified as the stories based on via's from a via.

Because their back-end was designed to exchange trading cards, and their traffic accounts for over half of BTC's FX volume? So their database, programming language, and web server were chosen for stability over scaling. To a build and operate proper exchange you need a fault tolerant setup. Something like Erlang and Lighty as opposed to PHP and MYSQL. None of the other exchanges are much better they just have less traffic.

While that's true BitCoin's valuation is based on liquidity provided by payment processors, so really trading the currency/commodity/whatever is currently more of an abstraction layer piggybacking on the existing banking system. For right now anyways BTC isn't a standalone payment method. As the Chinese have proven you can do a lot to dissuade from accepting if you implement new financial regulations on a drip-feed basis as opposed to passing sweeping changes.
The only technical means of destroying the BitCoin economy would be by gaining a majority share of the computing power, and disallowing new transactions to logged in the block chain. So long as there's a financial incentive to mine that's not really a feasible solution for any government. Because even with DARPA-designed ASIC chips that price would easily be in the billions.
TL;DR: BitCoin's current valuation is dependent on liquidity provided by payment processors, so really the only element of BTC economy governments can readily destroy is the foreign-exchange markets. Every other means of shutting down BitCoin is simply impractical at this point in time.

Not even close, there's not a way of buying or selling coins without putting servers on some country's soil. Outside of exchanging them peer-to-peer of course. You'd have to organize the whole thing on TOR, and if they've forced BitCoin off the top-tier its pretty well over.

It's like watching the 2008 oil markets before the speculation bubble burst. The key difference being that every economy in the world runs on the stuff, so there was support 110 bucks or whatever it was per barrel. If history repeats itself as it tends to do this could be catastrophic. Like, when the Albanian Ponzi Scheme went bust kind of bad. I'm not saying BitCoins have no value, they clearly do, but 75, 100 or even 125 dollars? No way.

BitCoin needs tons of users, not hot European money flowing out of tax-havens. There's not millions of individuals buying up liquidity but individuals with millions. We're talking about billions of dollars potentially flooding the market eating up all the liquidity. Once a tenth of a coin is too pricey for the common man what's going to happen to the BTC economy? Tax evaders are looking for a place to stash their money not spend it.
