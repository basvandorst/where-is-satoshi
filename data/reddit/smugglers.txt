World Crypto Con is actually going to be celebrating this in Las Vegas. They expect 4000-6000 people during the event.

The whole convention isn’t bitcoin specific but the particular event would be. It’s better than nothing at least.

There was no long periods in between blocks that I observed. But the count has been going down anyways.

This is very true. Over the last several years I learned it also helps if you invest in other things like stocks or real estate. Keeps your mind open to other things and you have more to worry about (but less in a way).

I do not.

Brave is utilizing bitcoin right now, so I guess it's fair play.

Hi everyone,
I recently posted here about a news aggregator and price comparison tool that received a lot of interest! We finally set up a launch page for you to be notified by email when we officially launch. The date is set for October 24th!
Things included on launch:
* Unique News aggregator
* Twitter Feed aggregator
* A calendar containing dates for news, updates, meetings, and events for coins
* Calculate coins to fiat or coins to coins
* Social Interaction
We are working on a portfolio and will try to get that in with release, but we want to get it right and will not release it until is is 100% ready to go. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask. :)

Hi everyone,
I'm more of a lurker in Reddit these days. I just released my website, BitPicker.io, that can help you find the best crypto prices across multiple exchanges. Of course I made sure the most popular coin was working before release. There are still some things to get done and fix, so please bear with me while I push some updates out this week. Hope you guys enjoy it! Feedback is much appreciated. 
 To do list:
 Add Contact Us pop-up.
 Set up donation address
 Remove search query from URL.
 Support more exchanges (future update)
 Add BTC option for Choose Your Currency
 Add support for all coins. Many are missing or not      working.

Actually I’ll be the one to say that 1 Bitcoin does not always = 1 Bitcoin. Monero is the only true fungible crypto.
