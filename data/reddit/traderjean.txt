Had a stop win around 8500 EUR on GDAX, still see the order unfilled, cannot cancel it. All is stuck. It dropped to 7000 EUR apparently.

I have a hard time to see how this will apply to BTC FUTURES. The point I was trying to make is that if government tried to undermine Gold by facilitating the introduction of a futures market (which seems to have worked short term since gold lost 50% in the next 2 years) – wouldn't they do it again ? The main difference I see here is that the world goes way faster than in the 70s, the velocity is nothing compared, so it won't take 2 years for BTC to get hit. We're talking months instead of years. And if it follows gold path BTC could be trading $40k with 12-24 months. But in the mean time, futures might put a halt to the party

They are pretty much anecdotal compare to a CME/CBOE future that will become mainstream.

Interesting also to see that Gold topped in dec 1974 when the futures where introduced :

Thanks for your input. The more I research this the more I agree with you. Nothing goes up forever. Even though calling a top on a move like is impossible... Futures introduction seem like a plausible reason to top, especially if we keep blowing up like this into the intro.

Also think that market cap is ONLY 180 bln. Yes only, cos in wall street terms this isn't much at all. Futures open the doors for big Hedge Funds to play around and especially go short. For now it's all one sided. Either you get in (buy) or get out (sell). Most people want to get in, and supply is limited. So prices do what we see now (and I'm not gonna complain about it). Now when the golden boys can short this, and create unlimited supply, what happens ? What if a few multi billions funds decide to bet against BTC ? And that's just one part. They are 100 crypto funds, what if they want to hedge ?  It also adds supply...
