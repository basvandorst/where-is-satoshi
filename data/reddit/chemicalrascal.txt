No. They're pushing for *fraud and theft* to be a criminal offense, should this be revealed as a matter of MtGox running off with their own vault. Because that's fraud and theft. Which is a criminal offense.
I, personally, don't believe that the market should be *completley* unregulated, but that's a discussion for another time.

Ah, I see a problem here. Before I perhaps talk about the block chain in a conceptual sence, there's a problem with your definition of decentralised. Which is okay, but it needs to be clarified.
Decentralised does not mean independent, as independent does not mean decentralised. To demonstrate, because we're talking about entities in a greater system, consider the following scenario:
Alice, Bob, and Claire are playing a game of poker at a casino, with a dealer. Because the dealer acts as a centralised authority, and controls the game, as well as resolving disputes, it is a ***centralised*** system. When Claire cheats, the dealer decides to kick her out of the casino.
Alice, Bob, and Claire are playing a game of poker, privately and without a dealer. Because they are each responsible for making up their own mind and have agreed to resolve disputes by majority consensus, it is a ***decentralised*** system. When Claire cheats, Alice, Bob, and Claire vote, and as Alice and Bob saw her cheat they hold majority, and Claire leaves the game (possibly by being escorted out by Alice and Bob).
Alice, Bob, and Claire are in three separate locations, and each is playing solitaire because poker is for chumps. Each has no influence on the other's game at all, they are all ***independent.*** When Claire cheats in her game, she feels sad, because who even cheats in solitare I mean really, come on, wtf Claire.
I hope that helps explain the difference between decentralised and independent. It's important to note that you can't have any finance system - certainly not a currency - that involves all parties being independent, because it wouldn't do anything: nobody would have anyone to transfer their wealth to. It's like sitting down at a poker table by yourself, alone.

Oh, of course - current legal entities don't know and don't care about cryptocurrencies. My above suggestion of legal action was very much an attempt to speak of the hypothetical, hopeful future where Bitcoin (or, at least, cryptocurrencies in general) had further adoption, to the point that financial crimes investigators developed understanding of and experience in dealing with the blockchain. (To some extent, I'd suggest that even today, competent lawyers could succeed in civil cases relating to Bitcoin fraud or theft, although it wouldn't be easy, and likely prohibitively expensive for all but the largest of frauds.)
That said, I'd suggest that even if one were to pass a sum through a number of wallets, bitcoins can't really be laundered - the final transfer of those coins, assuming they are actually used to purchase something, almost by nessecity involves information about that purchaser being revealed - whether that be a street address because they bought something from Amazon, or a blurry CCTV image because they bought a hamburger and used some sort of cellphone-QR-code-payment-doohickey.
If that wallet can be matched to an identity, and that identity a person and that person found, it becomes possible to begin working back through the sequence of wallets. Even if they purchased those coins at an exchange, the exchange then becomes the next entity to question. Of course, that's a lot of effort to go to for more minor crimes, but as with matters of laundered cash, it just becomes a matter of following the money trail and dedicated investigative work.
As for seizing illicit funds: Seize private keys, transfer all coins to police_holding_case_XYZ.wallet.

I've got a feeling we aren't going to be able to come to an agreement here.

Ow. You are beating me up over the internet. Your insults, now that they are directed at my person, make me more likely to agree with you. Oh? So you called me a dickhead? *Tell me who you voted for, I want to fellate him.*
I'm not talking about being nicely nicely and such. Reasoned debate doesn't work, however, if your audience isn't listening to you. And if you alienate your audience, *they won't listen to you.* ***Calling people names alienates them.*** QED.

And that's where you're wrong, as you *should* want to be at least cordial with them - insults will alienate them and your arguments, regardless of merit (though in this case your arguments are without), will be dismissed, ignored, unread.
Nobody ever convinced anyone of anything by first calling them an arsehole.

This isn't a matter of censorship, it's a matter of "Hey, let's *not* break the law and get arrested, or the TOS and have the admins shut down r/Bitcoin".
Secondly, for the record, flinging insults like a monkey throwing it's own feces about doesn't net you many friends.

I hate to say it, while it's good that you have enough interest in Bitcoin to know the related terms, it appears you actually have very little understanding of how the protocol (and, hence, the block chain) works. I'd encourage you to keep learning, though!

There are different methods to achieve most objectives, but cutting off one's nose isn't an effective method of travelling to the Moon.
You're trying to convince someone of your arguments and point of view. Alienating them does only harm, and never good, in this endevour. To insult your *target audience* is to cut off your nose.

Are you sure? The broadcasting time of a block should be absolutley miniscule when compared to the total time taken to find a valid nonce, even if it does scale with transactions in the block.
@_date: 2014-03-09 22:05:33




That's only if you consider Bitcoin as a *commodity*. Obviously, Bitcoin can't be made into a, say, loaf of bread like wheat can. As a tradeable commodity, it is valueless... But then again, the same can be said for the USD notes in your pocket.
I say that because (ideally) BTC has value as a *currency*, in the same way that all currencies have value - through determination by the greater market, as a method of weath transfer. If your employer decides that an hour of your time is worth four hamburgers, and the market decides a hamburger costs 5 USD, an hour of your time (and hence your wage) is worth 20 USD.
And similarly BTC. It doesn't have to be tied to anything - as a currency, it simply needs to say that you have the weath to buy four hamburgers per hour worked, and serve as a medium to transfer that wealth.




While the current core bitcoin protocol doesn't support chargebacks (I will concede that I don't think it will support chargebacks for the forseeable future, and likely forever won't without a culture/goals shift in the core bitcoin dev group), insurance can be provided by third parties. That isn't infeasible.
On a similar note, chareback functionality could (potentially) be at least emulated, from a consumer perspective, by escrow facilities. Both of these concepts, though, do involve trusted third parties, which of course reduces bitcoins decentrality. This isn't nessecarily good, of course, and the ecosystem will decide, in the long run, if insurance and escrow is an acceptable level of centralisation.
All of that said, though, fraud and theft are still criminal acts. Because BTC is a public ledger, someone can't rip you off and then spend their ill-gotten gains to buy their hamburgers without, on some level, revealing their identity and leaving a paper trail. Cue *My Little Legal System: Police Raids Are Magic* theme.

Your error is that you are equating the act of botnetting to things known to be unethical (bankrobbing, provokeless facestabbing), and hence basicially saying "if we assume this to be unethical, it is unethical."
As for Kant - if Kant operates under the assumption that everyone is capable, then it does apply. However, not everyone is capable, and hence Kant does not apply.

Eh. I agree with the general consensus that AlbertBitcoin is an invented persona, but the only elderly person I know to use a computer - my grandmother - actually has very good typing skills. This may have been due to a lot of work as a secretary, though.
Actually, though, if AlbertBitcoin had been one of the early adopters of AOL, as he describes towards the end of his post, I'd say he'd actually have better typing skills than what is demonstrated. If AlbertBitcoin is a persona, the person behind it might have made the mistake of over-emphasising typing errors.
@_date: 2013-12-01 07:38:09
A small clarification: For those who don't quite get what a ledger is, it's basically a listing of transactions.
Which means that "Bitcon's ledger", the blockchain, is a complete, infallible list of every Bitcoin transaction ever made - and not just conventional transactions, but also successfully mined coins and such.
And that's all public. Indeed, that's by design, because it's what allows the system to be distributed (without central banks) - everyone needs to see and verify everyone's transactions.
Of course, do note that while the system is completely public, that doesn't mean that it isn't still anonymous - when set up right, there still isn't any way to associate an address *to* a particular wallet (and, IIRC, each wallet has a number of possible addresses), and hence no way to associate an address to a particular person. If it's been set up right.

Trust me, laypeople associate the "matrix look" - indeed, just about anything computery - with hacking.
Bitcoin needs to present itself as not being computer wizardry, because people fear that because they don't understand it, and they don't want to. Honestly, the way to improve Bitcoin's image is probably to distance it as much as possible from computers.
