my girlfriend threatens to break up whenever i mention Bitcoin

this is laughable. is there any mechanism in place which can actually tell whether the fork proposal is contentious or non-contentious?

of course she jokes about it. :) but overall, she thinks its too much to understand. :) I have tipped her many times though.. :D

market seems to recovering at last.. Good old lord..

I have reading this piece lately, which presented a completely new theory on Bitcoin's current fall. The writer says: 
"There is a huge chance that early adopters are giving up on the coin, and are selling it at low to recover whatever they can save, or make. A rumor is also coming to the wires, saying that one single investor has sold over 30,000 BTC on BitStamp, only at $300. More would be discussed later upon the conformation of the event."
What's ur view friends?

okay he left me heart broken. The law has to be more lenient towards people who could actually contribute back to the society. He was indeed trying to escape imprisonment and must be held for lying about his involvement with a wrongly-turned-out marketplace. But on the other hand, can't we substitute his youthful arrogance with a less harsh lesson -- not 20 years of his life, please. 
For law, he has turned out to be a drug dealer. I don't know whether to despise or support such a ruling. My heart just cry over the emotional impotencies of such judgements.

uber, bitcoin and a 'dollar-oriented' cash processing company.. same old crap..

he was offering a place to sell potentially dangerous drugs. This is the money that currently funds world terrorism. A moral thing, however glossy it may look on the layers, is still worst when its backing elements that kill you, me and everyone.

i am sure international media will use this event to propagate their anti-Bitcoin stance. 
@_date: 2016-01-28 10:49:41
just like they destroyed pharmaceutical industry..

it seems like an attractive website to me. 
@_date: 2015-07-15 09:47:19
but haven't they announced partnership with Braintree? They said they'll be accepting Bitcoin payments..

 it seems he was working on his own.
@_date: 2016-02-10 14:44:27
Apparently, the cops said it was illegal. They are funny trust me! :D

Hello Buzzdron, My name is Yashu Gola and I am one of the writers associated with NewsBTC.com. We never had a chance to speak with Nikhil Gupta, who originally did this story, as he is off hours for now. Based on your findings, we are currently putting a note on the top of this article.
We will soon update this post as soon as we get in touch with Nikhil. The article will be in trash if there is 1% truth in your claim I assure you personally.

the value is the victim of greed.. the technology is what defines Bitcoin for long term..

Hello NimbleBodhi, I appreciate your frank take on our website and would really work towards matching your taste. Rest assured, we are also among the only websites which takes courage to speak up when something wrong has done by our own lot. Trust me, we are not feeding our own egos at this moment but are simply trying to fix a mistake and save people from signing up at this company. 
We have sent emails to its owners and would soon publish their replies. Again, I truly apologize that this story was published without anyone's notice (our editor is on leave, getting married).

I really thank you for updating us and rest of the community Buzzdron. I just found out that their email ID was as much as fake as those comments that were posted under our "embarrassing" article. 
BELIEVE ME, he'll be flogged with eggs for this. In a best case scenario, we will reroute his payment to your account as a tip for saving our "you know what". 
Please return to NewsBTC. :) The site loves you all.
