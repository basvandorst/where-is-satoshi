Bitcoin is going to go in the direction of:

How long have you been doing the standard buy every friday?  I want to set up something similar.  The amount I have to put in every week though is small, and the fee on coinbase is not insignificant.  What exchange do you use?  Sorry for having literally nothing to contribute to your question ha ha ha.  Thanks

So, really stupid question... If this is the case, what is the point of keeping a hard wallet? If it doesn't matter if it gets smashed or lost, and all that matters is your private keys written on a piece of paper?
