How did they get into your email?
@_date: 2014-01-03 07:44:46
...as long as they pay their taxes
@_date: 2014-01-06 07:47:33
any idea how they got your email and password? It seems you are quite compromised.
Enable 2 fa on your email immediately and everything that you can. And change your passwords.

Give bitcoins to me

You troll because you perceive r/bitcoin to have an anti-Apple stance.

If bitcoin was significant revenue for any business, it is only practical to reduce the risk to the bitcoin volatility and convert to usd. They would need usd to pay taxes anyway on the bitcoin earned.
It doesn't matter how much you believe in it, bitcoin will swing in price hugely and kill margins. Only a company using bitcoin as a small source of income can keep bitcoin due to reduced risk. I wouldn't restrict your merchants based on how they handle bitcoin in order to survive. They have employees with families to provide for.

Not to my knowledge. Ask the nsa, they know more than me

Reusing an address over and over doesn't appeal to me. I don't want to buy my porn with the same address I used to buy my flight into space.

If you want to be a worthless piece of shit, that's your decision

An easy dictionary attack on the password? I don't think they can brute force a web service. 8 characters can be seeing if sufficiently random.

I told my doctor the same thing

Are they any worse than the real bfl?

Not good. We don't want any hint of drugs being associated with bitcoin.
Edit: sarcasm warning

Now a scammer is introduced to the idea of bitcoin. I'm sure he'll use that in a socially productive way.

You want to buy socks? Did I guess right? If so, I'm bringing it to a new level.

The comments in this post are terrible. Your one I'd the only good suggestion and it is buried at the bottom.

Lost private keys
That article doesn't provide enough information. It is just a primer.

Unless we can prove terrorists took it. Our using the example, my diamond ring with a usb drive got stuck in a car door and broke and my bitcoin are lost forever.
