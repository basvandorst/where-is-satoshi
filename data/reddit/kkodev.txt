This will probably get downvoted into oblivion but do you realise that bitcoin ‘tech’ is a 1-man side project and basically a glorified torrent? Nobody uses or cares for it besides get rich quick. So yeah, it’s all about the price and also price movements. 
It’s already at the point where nurses on Quora are giving advice to people to watch out when Tesco staff start talking bitcoin. Yeah.
Call it tulips or ‘new paradigm’.
Tech is certainly at the heart of it.

The real issue is not really about getting in at the wrong time, it's about getting out at the right time. There is wide consensus that there is room for the price to grow but nobody can guarantee the price won't reach $25k, $100k or $500k only to collapse to $100 over following few days. So close, and yet so far

I like your approach to estimating potential but there is a flaw in your calculations. You say 3.6 trillion USD *a year*.
You can assume there are 10 million bitcoins in use globally, but that doesn't give an idea how many are *exchanged annually*. You can make a very rough estimate by looking at blockchain txn data. I would put it at average of 1000 BTC/min, which gives you 525,600,000 bitcoins worth of purchases a year.
3600000mil / 525mil = $6857 per coin, close to current price.
