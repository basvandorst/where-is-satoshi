Not a shop, yet. Placing the ATM in someone else's business.

Um yeah. Read my comment. I'm saying that an exponential curve isn't possible?

From the US and don't know much about French laws. But generally speaking you don't have to pay on anything unless you transfer back to fiat. Once you do that you owe capital gains on the difference.

Probably because it's one of 15 upcoming forks. X11 algorithm is an interesting choice.

Wut? Nothing can rise forever. No example of anything, ever.

It really blows my mind when I see these kinds of comments. Every single thing you said here is false. That is not how SPV wallets work.

No. The theory is the larger blocks will require more bandwidth for nodes to process. Centralizing the running of a full node.
Storage and mining hardware arent the issue.

People here are delusional. 
BTC rises 100% in a week - natural growth
BCH rises 100% in a week - fckin Roger pumpin
BTC falls 30% in a day - Wall Street manipulating 
Anything else falls 30% - stupid pump n dump shit
Do people really believe that the exponential curve can continue straight up forever?

I laughed out loud at this one. Freaking hilarious

Bigger blocks require the same hardware to mine, and do not take more blocktime. Storage and bandwidth do change however. 
Storage is negligible $180 for 8TB hard drive takes 140 years to fill ups with 1mb. 20 years with 8mb. Moors law says this won't really be an issue because storage gets cheaper. 1GB in 2000 was $7.00 and in 2017 it's dropped to $.02 per GB. 
Bandwidth theoretically is the issue. A bigger blocksize = more transactions to relay. In some places people can't get enough bandwidth to run a node at all, let alone one with bigger blocks. So people are concerned about running a relay node in third world countries and big cities.
