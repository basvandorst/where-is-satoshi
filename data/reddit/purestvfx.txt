Seems the actual transaction cost will be much higher than that, since you must take into account the cost of opening/closing the channel. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 09:06:47
Please do try - and report back how much it actually cost you in fees.
@_date: 2018-01-10 08:33:34
Opening or closing the channel requires paying a normal transaction fee correct? How many transactions need to be done before closeing the channel for the fee to be genuinely this low?
@_date: 2018-01-10 09:05:06
But both parties of a LN transaction can close the transaction i believe (otherwise how can they settle up?) Meaning that the channel could be closed after a single transaction...
@_date: 2018-01-10 08:58:29
What is the expected/predicted avarage number of transactions befor a channel is closed? 
@_date: 2015-12-22 00:16:42
saw this and thought: maybe this is really good news!..... checked the market: nope its meaningless. 
@_date: 2015-06-01 20:58:51
The meaning of deflation seems to have been perverted somewhat. It seems that the euro can be printed in large quantities, and yet still be deflating ?!?
@_date: 2015-06-02 16:43:38
nice explanation.
@_date: 2015-06-24 20:30:37
Will there be free beer there?
@_date: 2015-06-02 15:17:44
If euros are being created, then the total amount of euros is increasing/inflating.  Deflation would indicate that the total number of euros was being reduced.
@_date: 2014-03-17 13:35:40
I didn't get it.  Now that I do its actually less funny.
@_date: 2014-02-22 11:31:15
yes I understand.  my point is that they can also change the id of the retry - so it also looks like it failed - and then gets re-retryed.
and on and on.
@_date: 2014-08-23 08:20:03


That was probably a decent experience for the buyer though.

@_date: 2014-05-24 12:01:46
Agreed. But most transfer of wealth via bitcoin that has happen in its lifetime has also happened in the last 12 months.  We could hit 1% of paypal volume in the next year maybe, and after that... ...the moon.

@_date: 2014-05-15 22:41:14
100 bits
I don't think all your ideas are great but I do think you are encouraging good discussion and ideas  
@_date: 2014-10-26 16:04:48
erm... whys that? using bitcoin can be cheaper than other methods for the merchant - so they can at least discount by that much without losing money. -and have you heard about promotions? what about marketing?
If a 10% discount results in a merchant losing money then they are doing it all wrong.
@_date: 2014-05-11 18:10:58
yer so even a brief spike above $430 resets the 48 hour timer... since the average price movement over 24hours is more than $30, I wouldn't start worrying about losing the bet unless the price falls bellow $400.

actually, since stealing bitcoins in this way involves a second transaction to the same address of an identical amount, could we not search the blockchain for these paired transactions and work out how much was stolen?

when I am out for the evening I often ask the bar staff / kebab man / charity beggars if they accept bitcoins.  They normally stare back at me blankly, but I think it helps.  the next time someone asks they will probably understand the question at least, and the time after that they may say to their boss: "people keep asking to pay with bitcoin"

Most of your criticism in this post seems to take the form : "the answer to the question is not completely obvious".
Section 4, position 4: have you seen the terminal that this question refers to? Top tip : the letters "Dr" before a name indicates that the person is a doctor.
Section 4, position 14: this question is just too easy.

With fiat currencies, most people have most money in banks that are using fractional reserves to increase the money supply.
With bitcoin people are more likely to hold it themselves - so the money wont get multiplied so much - this means that more will be needed, ie: higher value.
@_date: 2014-02-22 11:03:12
bitcoin is still quite difficult to actually use, buy and sell.
but it will become increasingly easy as lots of atm's get installed and more merchants accept it etc...

If the thief received two transactions, then there must be two transactions in the blockchain.
Actually they would probably try to change the id of all the subsequent transactions, meaning that the might have been able to receive many resubmitted coins on the back of a single real transaction.
@_date: 2014-02-24 22:11:29
I think this is needed.
the transaction fee is currently holding down the price in my opinion.

Mpesa balances are in the local currencies, and the long-term fall in the value of these currencies will make bitcoin look good.
The system is vulnerable to political interference (stopping payments for stuff the government doesn't like, freezing the accounts of activists ... etc). 
Telecommunications companies have a history of going bust... 
Also it has much higher fees than bitcoin.

There is allot of rich people in Dubai that will spend cash on something just because it is new, but only if it is convenient.  If this is true then it will have an impact on the market.

I don't think we should encouraging a "them and us" mentality.  Bitcoin is for everyone, its just that some people wont know it until it is accepted everywhere and easy to use. 
@_date: 2014-05-11 22:15:05
I think this is only for settling dept. A merchant is not obliged to sell to everyone - by which I mean that they can refuse a customer if they want to.  (if I am a window cleaner I am not legally obliged to clean everyone's windows that asks - I can pick which customers to serve) like this I can simply refuse any customers that don't use my preferred payment mechanism.   
@_date: 2014-04-12 17:37:43
They are all non-ambiguous.  -So they are as you would expect them to be, like a name always starts with a capital letter etc...
@_date: 2014-03-14 11:45:39
its needed, but you could make it look nicer.

From what I have seen, and given that everyone now knows its not actually him - I think its a great idea - and he would probably think it was a bit of fun and be honoured.
@_date: 2014-04-23 11:48:55
I have not downvoted your comments.
also I would like to point out that creating this quiz was quite allot of effort - and I put in £100 for prizes.  (I provide the prize money).
The quiz may not be perfect but I am trying to improve it. It cost time and money and makes nothing back.  its ment to be fun.
ps - I will publish the solutions this weekend along with the next quiz.
@_date: 2014-04-29 15:10:18
@_date: 2014-05-04 07:32:39
There is no mix up.  So just use the first letter of the number. For example nine (9) starts with 'n'

I think you meant: "what is 'what'?"

Basically a good idea. But prices would need to be in BTC, and everything the same price...  All ideas for simplifying POS are good news though.
@_date: 2014-07-20 16:36:36
That has been there a while. a month maybe.
I have used it.  The experience wasn't that great - it seemed to be in some kind of sleep mode and was unresponsive at first - once it "woke up" it seemed fine though. 
@_date: 2014-04-21 16:46:30
Congratulations.  Did you need to do any kind of brute force to get the complete key, or just answered all the questions?
That's true about proving using the receive address - but I work all week so I need excuses to only update the site on the weekend!   :P
@_date: 2014-08-16 17:37:25

I agree that this is a bad idea and will never happen
@_date: 2014-12-20 16:40:21
has there ever been a full block?
@_date: 2014-05-15 22:33:28
yer. I used a carwash that had a buy ten half price (you paid for 5 washes but got ten). most people go for the deal, including me, cos it was so much cheaper - though I think I only ever used about 5 of the tokens :)
@_date: 2014-03-17 13:25:37
So what are the estimates from these? - or what would people estimate from what they know?

i also want to know the answer to this...

this sort of thing is a bad idea
@_date: 2014-05-27 14:25:27
so.... its great and everything, but what is meant to actually happen at this place?  do they buy and sell bitcoin?
who funds it?
@_date: 2014-05-14 18:34:59
hmmm... I don't want to go and randomly tip someone though... I'd prefer to wait until I see something that I genuinely feel is worth a tip.

I am tempted....
@_date: 2014-03-08 14:22:56
I don't think we need to make bitcoins any more complicated than they are already.  New users are not going to want to learn a new way of counting.
@_date: 2014-03-09 10:55:19
Looks good though I don't really understand the scripting language.
Would it be possible to set up something like:
Send 10% of wallet balance to an address once a day, but only if that receiving address itself has a balance above 0.1BTC... 
@_date: 2014-08-03 08:34:40
what time did you donate? I cant see it....
@_date: 2014-04-14 23:49:39
potentially yes - although I would expect/hope that this will not be needed. Also the wallet import format includes error checking within it, as far as i understand - so if you were 99% correct then perhaps this could be used to brute force the answer?
Anyway I will be posting 5 quizzes, so maybe if you cant solve one then you can solve another.
ps - thanks for your interest!  
@_date: 2014-08-23 22:48:51
if you send cash in an unmarked envelope how do you know if it arrives? what if it gets lost in the post? also this is a slow method, with a minimum fee (cost of stamp).


Why do you say that?

@_date: 2014-08-07 13:45:38
Depends on the printer.  Imagine some malware that automatically changes any bitcoin qr codes to a different address, install that on every printer you can.  printer works flawlessly for most prints, but if anyone prints bitcoin wallets...
or - printer stores all private keys printed out.  If the printer is ever connected to the internet then these are sent to someone who empties the wallets.   
@_date: 2014-02-22 17:12:27
It sound like you are misunderstanding it to me.
The first 5btc transaction is successful and makes it into the blockchain - only with a modified id.
Because of the modified id mtgox wrongly believes it has failed, and sends a second 5btc transaction.
So there are now 2 transactions in the blockchain of 5btc each.

people giving me bitcoin is a pretty positive development from my point of view....
@_date: 2014-10-18 22:49:09
there is plenty of support to keep the price up. for example - I would buy vast amounts of bitcoin if the price was $1. I would buy a decent bunch at $10, and a few at $100. I did buy 1 at $300.  I am basically poor, so am only buying when it seems like a super good deal. plenty of people are not poor
@_date: 2014-10-13 15:00:58
He like to talk doesn't he. im not sure I agree with it all.
@_date: 2014-02-24 23:20:47
Satoshi gave away many clues to his identity early on (via the source code etc).  While I have no idea who he is, is it not reasonable to assume anyone with the relevant resources does? (FBI etc....) 
@_date: 2014-06-30 11:50:44
do you mean: "his predicted maximum value" ?
@_date: 2014-12-29 10:39:40
It is cheap. The average price over the last 12 months must be double that.

@_date: 2014-03-17 17:30:02
It is currently not efficient to tip/transfer small amount of bitcoin below 50 cent. Maybe lower fees would help.
@_date: 2014-04-20 13:01:35
yes - tis done.  The keys are generated with [vanitygen](  so I am confident they are valid. -Its just a case of making sure all the answers to the questions are not ambiguous and that they resolve to the same key.
@_date: 2014-07-04 11:54:39
But they will be aware that they are investing.  
Most people I know do not consider having money in their current account as investing.

@_date: 2014-04-22 08:14:20
I will put more clarification into the actual quiz rather than answering here - it is useful to have you highlighting areas of possible confusion, thanks!
@_date: 2014-04-19 16:53:00
The audio is not clear.  -and it sounds a bit like someone at school reading from a text book.
I recommend learning the text and then saying it in a way as if you were explaining to someone actually there, rather than reading it out into a mic while sat in your bedroom.

Do you accept bitcoin in your store?
if so please add it to coinmap.org
@_date: 2014-02-22 17:04:20
if mtgox really is going to allow withdrawals the I would expect the price to rise further - so buy now.
on the otherhand they could announce bankruptcy, which would probably cause a drop in price - so wait.  
@_date: 2014-04-13 21:38:08
ok - then that makes sense. YES
@_date: 2014-08-04 09:31:15
Why should I have to lie?  Why should I have to fill out a form at all?
Donating would be voting that being asked for details is ok (in a way).
I sometimes give a spare £1 coin to tramps in the street.  If they asked for my name and address I would tell them to fuck off.

maybe because I am in the UK.

credit card fees are charged to the merchant. they increase their prices to cover the fees.  basically this means everyone ends up paying the fees - its just they are hidden.

Is being 'more advanced' a good thing?  keep it simple stupid?
it seems like a decent solution to me, and I don't think your negativity is helpful
@_date: 2016-06-16 15:42:45
Errr... no. They are still sitting on 0 confirmations.
@_date: 2016-06-16 07:48:12
I did 2 "low-priority" transactions last night and was surprised to see that they had not confirmed this morning...  
@_date: 2017-01-30 05:46:59
That argument works at any percentage: "at 95% consesus you create an altcoin since the original bitcoin lives on with 5%" 
@_date: 2017-01-29 19:17:34
bitcoin could change with a much lower than 95% consensus though.  Arguably 51%
@_date: 2017-08-22 18:30:24
Ico needs something of value behind it to make the marketing easier 
@_date: 2017-01-29 20:19:30
Risks aside, a hark fork is theoretically possible at 51%.
Where did the 95% number come from? why would 94% (as an example) not work? 
@_date: 2017-01-30 06:00:06
That is ridiculous 
@_date: 2015-08-23 00:14:03
ok - but I can't currently spend or hold bitcoinXT coins can I? All the other altcoins in your diagram I can own and transfer.   -edit: more to the point, your diagram shows separate blocks from XT, but no separate blockchain currently exists. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 08:14:53
@_date: 2015-08-22 23:57:39
So your diagram should maybe show the state we are now (as a dotted line?).  I guess what you are saying is that XT is not yet an alt coin, but that it will be in future if 75% of miners switch to it? 
@_date: 2015-08-22 23:51:12
I like the diagram, and get the point - but it is misleading.  XT has already 'got blocks', and they are part of the main bitcoin blockchain.  Am I misunderstanding?
@_date: 2015-08-23 00:18:35
your diagram shows a separate XT chain that does not currently exist. 
@_date: 2015-08-23 00:33:06
just a single block?
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:02:32

$0.50 is allot to pay, especially if you want the network to be useful to poor people/countries.
2 hours is a long wait for a transaction to confirm, especially when there is no way to know if it will be 2 hours 2 days.....
The network must compete against legacy systems and altcoins, being slow and expensive does not help

Bitcoin will continue to exist and developers will continue to work on it. 
Nope, we will be freeing ourselves of centralised decision making.
The biggest problem at the moment is the core team 'going down in flames', by which i mean all the disruptive action they are taking to try to stay in control.

Im using Bitcoin. I have some Bitcoincash, since i have paper wallets from before the fork, but i cant say i have made much use of it

Seems well planned and straight forward to me. Lets agree to disagree.

I don't know the address of the place, nor can I confirm that they accept bitcoin. ...
@_date: 2015-04-06 08:36:19
it's not on coinmap.org
nothing ever is...
There is literally no easy way to find locations that accept bitcoin.

err... we are not talking about a group of kids in a street gang who ripped off a betting shop.  
If this was a group of people then they were a solid crew.

All the problems you describe are with converting dollars to bitcoin.  Now that you own some bitcoin you can do whatever you want with it and no one can stop you. Also - consider the price despite the difficulty of buying, what would happen if it became much easier?

EUR-&gt;BTC-&gt;EUR does not make much sense at the moment its true.
In situations where you already have multiple currencies it makes more sense.
GBP-&gt;BTC-&gt;EUR is probably less expensive than  GBP-&gt;EUR.  (or at least could be). I currently have sterling and euro in my wallet. 
If enough merchants accepted bitcoin, then I could avoid worrying about always carrying local currencies.
I'm sure there are people that find themselves with 4+ different currencies in their wallet.

Bigger blocks would allow more transactions.

most of the current miners are considerably less efficient - so the total current power use is allot higher than that.

I find my opinion to be inline with many others - and have not heard any reasonable arguments against my opinion.  Maybe you could provide an argument against my opinion?

After having a small amount of interaction with you, I conclude that you probably should be banned from anywhere that constructive debate is wanted.

so should I fill out a form or something?  remember: In my world view you are a deluded person with false beliefs.  I have no desire to learn from you.  You have an opportunity to change my mind, but it seems you are not even going to try. 
@_date: 2015-02-22 15:33:05
if you had a target along the lines of: spend 50% of available funds over the next 3 months. Then nodes would be a bit more long term. 
@_date: 2015-03-01 10:34:21
seems a slightly strange option - what is the reasoning? 
@_date: 2017-07-29 16:57:41
I believe that the block size limit should have been raised years ago. Feel free to try and change my mind.
