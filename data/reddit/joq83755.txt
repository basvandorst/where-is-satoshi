If I bought $100 Bitcoin and a week later the price rose and it worth $200 and I used it to buy a phone. Does that mean I have to pay tax on the $100 difference? And if I bought the phone at $200 btc and sold it for $250, Id need to pay tax for $150 right?

The legit sellers are the one that get their gift cards through incentive/rewards site. Everyone else are probably not.
@_date: 2018-09-01 19:49:42

He's hoping you be a stupid greedy dishonest guy who will steal the fake.75 coin by depositing the .02 real btc

Nice of the thief for returning your phone. Watch out for keylogger lol
@_date: 2018-10-08 08:06:53
Nothing will change. It will just like paying with a credit card. Everything will be automated. I paid with Bitcoin, they receive bitcoin, they ship out my order. Only time a human is needed is to pack and deliver my order.
@_date: 2019-11-12 08:24:59
Blockfi and Celsius pay 4-6% interest for your Bitcoin. What your bank pay for your usd?
@_date: 2019-11-11 06:54:30
If he's a reputable seller, it probably not a scam.
@_date: 2018-10-08 08:54:00
When there's an app where we can pay, send and receive btc payment with little or no fee. Like venmo but with the benefit of Bitcoin. When are we getting that app?

Don't trust everything you see on the internet.op included
@_date: 2019-11-07 09:59:07
But op is the buyer/sender?
seems like op is asking for advice on how to scam btc seller on localbitcoin?
@_date: 2018-10-15 10:06:38
Maybe don't invest until you know the difference between Bitcoin and Bitcoin core.
@_date: 2018-10-09 08:47:59
You can sell them for Bitcoin in r/gcx. Don't go first unless the buyer is reputable.
@_date: 2019-11-05 09:09:31
If the number of transactions increase 10x, the fee will probably increase drastically.
@_date: 2018-10-27 16:13:27
There are people that sell them on other subreddit. 
@_date: 2018-10-05 08:52:45

Why not just buy Amazon gift cards at a discount with Bitcoin and purchase the item yourself?

Bitcoin is a scam. Climate change is a hoax.

It will be coded in their payment system. Their system will generate an address for me to pay when I checkout and their system will check the blockchain for confirmation. 
@_date: 2018-10-17 07:02:23
I'm pretty confident it gonna be around 7-9k unless something really good or bad happens
@_date: 2018-06-22 05:49:43
You can even get it at a discount at r/giftcardexchange. Just be careful who you deal with.
@_date: 2018-06-04 00:05:06
Always check the bill. I once sold an Xbox on Craigslist and later found out that some of the bill are fakes. Didn't think people would have the face to buy stuff in public face to face with counterfeit
@_date: 2018-06-22 05:45:04
I used bitcoin.tax. it very easy to use. I just add import my trades from different exchanges using API and it calculate everything for me.
@_date: 2019-06-30 16:03:47
It's on his own subreddit and he gave himself the trusted trader badge/flair. The reps on gcx profile are with a guy who was inactive for year and only recently became active and suddenly started trading. It most likely it either a hacked/cracked account he now has access to or he bought them. I'm pretty sure he has multiple accounts to do all these things. Also all the reps confirmations are from 1 days ago
@_date: 2019-10-06 08:20:36
It's ok for you to sell your coin but it's not ok for the exchange to sell your coin.
@_date: 2019-02-18 08:19:07
@_date: 2019-02-18 08:06:06
Is the site legit? 
@_date: 2019-06-30 15:47:26
At first glance all of his trades reps seem fake lol.
@_date: 2019-12-12 08:09:48
The problem is Amazon. Not Bitcoin and not even bitpay.

Did you say this happen to your friend also?
@_date: 2019-12-28 09:43:02
What worse is sometimes your bank will label your normal credit card usage as cash advance and you get charged that interest and cash advance fee without knowing until you check your statement
@_date: 2019-12-01 10:07:35
So if I have a taxable income of $10,000, the max Bitcoin I can cash out is $29,375 worth to not get capital gain tax? Or I can cash out $39,375 bitcoin and not get capital gain tax even if my taxable income is $100,000?
@_date: 2019-06-30 15:53:51
You should post this on his fake rep profiles
@_date: 2019-12-31 06:58:03
Proof or fake
@_date: 2019-12-31 06:47:28
Bet you didn't follow the tip/guide pinned on top and right side of gcx just like all the other newbies here who fail to read what is on the right side of this subreddit.
@_date: 2019-04-28 16:55:22
90% or 10% off. I can tell you how i obtain them so you know they're 100% legit.
@_date: 2019-04-28 19:37:03
We will trade on r/giftcardexchange and it will be public. You can check my reps and decide if u want to trust me or not. 
@_date: 2019-04-28 17:07:01
Definitely not from CPA if they are selling for 30% off. Very low chance it's actually from ewhoring.
@_date: 2019-04-28 07:41:11
I can sell you some. Check out my selling history.
@_date: 2018-11-03 09:25:29
Maybe the app is displaying segwit wallet but your coin is in legacy wallet? Never used the wallet so IDK.

Someone/something be like "hmm low buy wall, low liquidity let's dump coin now then buy back at lower price otc?"  Rinse and repeat. Easy profit.

I sell gift cards I got from incentive sites for Bitcoin.

Many will cash out enough to break even and hold the rest or exit altogether and never going back
@_date: 2019-01-10 09:57:51
Ain't gotta worry about that until years later. We're not even hitting 1 million txt per day yet. Not everyone going to open a channel at the same time. How many channel gonna get open and close per year in the coming year? How many people going to transact on lightning network and how often they cash out/close channel? If 5 billion people transact with Bitcoin how many actually going to be running their own node and channel? If 99% of all transactions going to be on lightning, is block size still going to be an issue?
@_date: 2019-01-10 10:37:58
What happen after all the coin been mined and all or majority of the transactions are taking place on lightning or other layers? How will it affect the fee and the miners and will it still be worth it for the miner?
@_date: 2019-01-04 08:39:59
If u bought btc back then, it very likely from another person on the internet and not through an exchange. 
@_date: 2019-01-10 11:04:15
Unless u doing 6-7 figures noone cares
@_date: 2018-11-29 09:55:32
I'm guessing its going back to 6k.
@_date: 2019-01-07 08:53:35
Transfer fee x million transfers per day from lightning network?
@_date: 2019-01-10 11:09:48
When Bitcoin shorts are high Bitcoin price go up, when shorts are low , price go down? Am I seeing some kind of manipulation here or that just how the market works?
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:57:18
I'm bout to say the same thing.
@_date: 2019-09-26 17:29:53
So exchange selling users' coins on their exchange and then buy back otc at lower price?
@_date: 2019-09-23 09:33:33

If they accept btc, they save on credit card fee, no charge back, no fraud. Don't see any reason why so many places don't accept btc. It's a no brainer

@_date: 2018-04-16 14:05:21
This exactly. I started on credit karma but then realized they didn't have what I needed so I ended up using a different tax software. Also many people who invested in crypto never heard or understand capital taxes so they probably have an accountant do the taxes
@_date: 2018-04-22 18:10:29
People would then realized they have so many choices of better cryptos in the world.
@_date: 2018-04-16 13:56:26
The stat from credit karma is not that accurate. I think people with crypto gain probably don't use credit karma to file tax. They either use a tax accountant since many are new and confused about capital taxes or if they traded alot they uses other tax software that let you import your trades data which credit karma taxes don't offer.
@_date: 2018-04-12 09:32:52
Checkout r/giftcardexchange. You can buy gift cards for less than facevalue there

Heres a possibility. Exchange dump users coins to drop the price and then buy back otc at lower price from miners. Easy profit
@_date: 2018-12-02 11:15:26
If exchange have so many of the users coin in their storage, what stopping them from selling/buying without the user/owner knowing and manipulating the price or is it possible? Let say 1000000btc belonging to users is sitting in coinbase wallet, and when buying/selling ratio is at 1:1 and volume is 1000btc per hour at 3am, they can just dump 10000 user's btc in that one hour and cause the price to drop 5-20% in less than an hour. Then they slowly buy back those 10000btc at the new low low price with some gain. So now they bought back the user 10000 btc plus maybe 2000btc with the same amount of money. So basically accumulate their own pile of coin at the expense of their users?

Buy Amazon gift card with it and sell it for Bitcoin with 10% discount.
@_date: 2018-12-17 08:00:03
We need a killer app like venmo with little to no fee. 
@_date: 2018-12-02 10:51:19
I sold Amazon gift card for 90% of its value on Giftcardexchange subreddit for Bitcoin. If you have legit cards you can sell them for 10% off for btc to some of the reputable buyers there.
@_date: 2018-12-05 18:18:19
Or maybe this is the reason the drop today because Bitcoin future is bad for Bitcoin.
