Yes. I mean, technological advances and overall economic development means that average wages, measured in stuff you can buy, is rising by 2-3% a year in the long term. But inflation means that both wages and prices rise by the same amount

I disagree that futures will bring volatility. On the contrary, it will lessen volatility, since it will show everyone where the market expect the price to go, which, baring any major changes, turns out to be correct. And I don't buy the argument that Bitcoin, as an asset, is any different from every other asset in existence.
It might bring a one time shock to volatility, since people gets taken by surprise by the future prices, but that's it

Nah. Medium and long term, sure. A change in the money supply just leads to a change in prices in the medium term. Short term, though, lowering the interest rate, which is how the central banks increase the money supply, raise output.

If mining is required to process a transfer, yeah. If not, Bitcoin can still work and doesn't have to collapse
