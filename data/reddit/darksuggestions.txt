BTC is a funny game. If you can throw out $300 and not worry about losing it then go for it. It could pay off and you could make $$$$$$ or you could make nothing. It’s like the lottery. Who knows if you’ll come out on top? 
Best of luck to you.

@_date: 2018-11-21 22:39:17
Just being a decent human being. Maybe them showing they have fortune is a cry for help and maybe I can offer a hand and still remain blind to that fortune. 
If you live your life only offering help for something in return then are you really living at all?

Is this the part where you find 1000 Btc or something crazy ��

Could be done in a couple hours.. if your willing to buy my services through escrow on dream market I’ll help you out but not willing to waste a couple hours of my time and not get paid ���� 
@_date: 2018-12-26 22:29:04
Sorted yet?
@_date: 2019-05-11 00:26:44
Do you have a bitcoin wallet?
@_date: 2018-12-03 23:53:48
I’ll buy them off you for BTC?
@_date: 2018-12-20 18:29:12
Coinbase is fine and also localbitcoin is fine.. I’ll happily sell you 2 btc if you are buying. I don’t think bitcoin will go up so I’m selling out and wouldn’t advise to invest but the choice is yours ����
