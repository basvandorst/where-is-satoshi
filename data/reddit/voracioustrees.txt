Monetary expansion will fall to 2%. Inflation will be whatever difference in the price of purchased goods is present 2 years away.

If I think it will be a good thing for the currency if it drops in price and stabilizes, does that count?

Aw yeah, CME is going to be selling BTC futures. Finally a reliable way to Short.

CME sells derivatives, which represent characteristics of underlying assets in the time domain. (Think like when the dollar was backed by gold). 
Bitcoin is notorious for being hard to Short due to it's nature. You can either buy Bitcoin, or sell it if you already have it, but you can't sell Bitcoin you don't have and borrowing it is next to impossible. 
With derivatives, you can sell (short) Bitcoin (by buying the negative derivative of it) without owning any and then buy it back (sell the derivative) after the price has dropped. If the price doesn't drop you take a loss because you still need to buy it back to close out. 
The derivative writer makes money without trading the real Bitcoin if the price goes against you or stays constant because you pay a fee to set up the derivative contract with the writer of it in the first place. 
But hey, if you know the price is going to drop by half the next day, and you short Bitcoin, you'll make twice your money when cashing out of the derivative.
That's not even mentioning the more exotic ones such as leveraged (think +$10 per dollar gain) or options (I'll buy 100 Bitcoin at $6500 a month from now and I'll pay $1000 for that option) or the weird basket ETF style things ( ETH + BTC + ETC + Dogecoin price , all averaged out)

Nah, Bitcoin is going to do to banks what Amazon did to the post office and email did to retail.
