I don't even wanna post the amount I jumped in on BTC... But I caught LTC @ $140...

Still causes confusion... Would you prefer $47 or $47 Satoshi? A Satoshi is only a penny @ $1M remember. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 10:41:15
That's a dollar symbol. A Satoshi is equivalent to 1 cent @ $1M. I don't think we should confuse the two characters.

How much for machine?

Let's look back on this post in 10 years... ��

Hal Finney must be Satoshi. Hal started off saying 21M, then said 20M. The rumor is Satoshi has 1M BTC. Does that answer questions for anyone other than myself? 
@_date: 2018-02-27 07:30:14
As a cryptography God, there's no way he had a typo with 20M right?
@_date: 2018-03-03 23:50:45
$44,000-$77,000 USD. ��

Anyone with troll in their name is obviously joking. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 19:49:07
Good luck on those numbers. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 19:10:36
$100M/BTC? ����
@_date: 2018-02-28 10:37:50
Don't insult my posts. ��

@ was always @ hashtag was the pound sign... You're not really arguing good points here. The dollar symbol is what we're running from. Why would we use it? That's disrespectful.

I feel he already knew hypothetically what it would become, and kept a trillion for himself only to sacrifice the other 20T... How philanthropic? 
@_date: 2018-02-27 00:02:19
It doesn't carry weight that there was a predetermined amount understood between Satoshi and Hal the first day? 
@_date: 2018-02-28 10:47:14
You say that like there's one for Bitcoin and one for Litecoin... (Nice try on the edit) &lt;We still need a symbol, you're only arguing for the sake of an early morning argument&gt;[go home Roger]

 That's what I said in the first place. You proved no point. It's pointless to use the dollar sign. Just STFU, and keep scrolling. Arguing makes you look petty.

IDGAF What you do. Don't wish shit on me but success... ✌

Why would you predict such a shitty fate though?
@_date: 2018-04-07 20:30:18
Why do you still feel the need to waste your type time? Do some productive Reddit research or something. FOH.

Bitcoin is here to stay...
