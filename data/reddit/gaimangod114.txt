That's correct, but your employer does not need to sign-up. You can actually sign-up at bitwagge as an individual and your employer does not even have to know. Privacy is key!

I am unable to collect directly in the countries that my clients are in. Bitwage does the collecting for me. Also, bitwage can send me mix of fiat and cyrpto :) rates are ok or could be better. Overall am tho am very pleased.

Or..just give them the bitwage bank info, tell them to send your pay there, then bitwage will send crypto to your wallet.

I use bitwage to collect my pay from my clients. They give me a bank account and I give that info to my clients. Clients pay into it, bitwage sends it to my wallet. Works well.

Bitwage. Your company or employer does not even have to know!

Can there be two exact recovery phrases in existence? What happens if I do a restoration and I get someone else's recovery phrase? If someone stole my 24 word recovery phrase, then what? I don't fully understand this. Thanks in advance!

Just use bitwage. You can send any percentage of your payroll payments to them. Your HR does not even need to know about it.

Nice. Tell them just to use bitwage and they can all get paid in btc, eth, and mix of fiat directly into their bank. It's a good way to dollar cost average!

Actually, I think bitwage also has a team wages service for corporations. You can use it to pay your workers.

If u use bitwage u can get paid in your desired ratio of btc/fiat. You can switch it up on the fly since it is self managed and gives you the power to change up your ratios, for ex. 50/50 one month then if u want 90% crypto / 10% fiat the next.

I am an international contractor, not based in the USA, without bitwage I am unable to collect my pay in btc from USA-based employer who is unwilling or unable to pay me in crypto. Bitwage is essential for me getting paid in btc.

Just going to leave this here as a reference point: What is the subjective theory of value? "Value is subjective and can't be measured" - 07/13/2009Murray N. Rothbard
  The subjective theory of value is a doctrine of value which advances the idea that the value of a good is not determined by any inherent property of the good, nor by the amount of labor required to produce the good, but instead value is determined by the importance an acting individual places on a good for the achievement of their desired ends.
