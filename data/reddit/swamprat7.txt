Maybe this is a dumb question but what's the purpose of having a bitcoin ETF that tracks bitcoin when u can just by the underlying component it tracks easily online. I can understand gold, oil and other commodities u don't want to necessarily take actual possession of but bitcoin is virtual in itself. Confusing. Why buy 10 shares when u can just buy 1 bitcoin on the exchange and its the same

That’s a lot of profit to withdraw I’d rather hodl since I speculate long term it’s gunna go up

Yeah that’s what I thought. U can’t set up weekly buys though right u have to consciously buy every week unlike coinbase

Why use coinbase to get out? Can’t u sell on an exchange and avoid their high fees? I am wondering this because I used to buy weekly from coinbase but realized the insane fees I was getting charged. I haven’t bought from an exchange before but am curious

How do u break the percentage down? Like total USD worth? If that’s the case now I’m probably 45% ETH 45%BTC and 10%BCH(all free obviously lol)

Is it safe to dump BCH now? I have been holding on to it bc 1) I still don’t know if this replay protection is true 2) I have a ledger nano s and running old firmware and afraid to wipe it clean and lose my bitcoin and ethereum (I do have my word phrase though stil nervous)
