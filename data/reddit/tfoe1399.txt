That's way too low, consider using at least $0.30 but it might not be so fast too.
I used $2 in my last transaction and it took about 30 minutes
@_date: 2017-02-08 01:48:34
wow man that's terrible, i'm really sorry you have to go through this, upvoted for visibility 
@_date: 2017-03-21 18:29:12
@_date: 2017-03-18 15:32:40
why are you hoping it goes down? so you can purchase at low?

lol 1 month? give it 2-3 days.
edit: honestly won't be surprised if it recovered tomorrow
@_date: 2017-03-18 15:50:48
I lost around $1.4k feelsbadman
its starting to recover a bit now, hopefully it keeps going.
@_date: 2017-03-19 06:10:47
preach it brotha
@_date: 2017-03-23 19:25:38
What about Keepkey?
@_date: 2017-03-18 15:31:02
I lost $1000 of my wallet without spending anything at all, I don't see any reason to keep holding
@_date: 2017-03-19 07:17:25
LocalBitcoins is the easiest by far
@_date: 2017-03-16 09:20:39
its perfect that way it is
@_date: 2017-03-22 16:08:20
I would like to know too, I have coins stored in a hardware wallet and in blockchain.info(online wallet), what will happen to both if the fork happened?
@_date: 2017-03-19 08:39:45
of course, many companies use them including steam
@_date: 2017-03-16 10:16:23
ich liebe dich
@_date: 2017-03-16 09:17:43
done ur welcome
@_date: 2017-01-22 01:41:23
I used blockchain.info, funny thing is the warning did show up saying my fee is way too high but I accidentally clicked send instead of canceling 
@_date: 2017-01-24 13:22:37
That’s true, I didn’t mean it that way though, I’m truly grateful for BTC.com for sending it back, I’ve edited the post
@_date: 2017-01-12 22:01:41
how dare u
@_date: 2017-01-22 01:41:21
I have just sent them a message, it says their offices is closed until Feb 2 though.. :/
 
@_date: 2017-01-21 13:32:56
no clue how to do that....
I wanted to use $0.50 in fees but... 
i dont think there is anything i can do, rip $460
@_date: 2017-01-11 18:42:52
seriously considering selling all my btc atm
@_date: 2017-01-23 03:31:59
Isn’t purse.io doing the same thing?
@_date: 2017-08-24 16:57:16
I have the EXACT same issue...
@_date: 2017-01-26 16:33:38
I don't have any yet but i'm really interested in keepkey
@_date: 2017-01-24 13:25:20
Absolutely not, my wording failed, I’m actually very grateful that they decided to give it back, I’ve edited the post
@_date: 2017-01-24 13:26:16
Signing the message was the first suggestion but then they decided to send it back to one of the 4 addresses that were used on that transaction.
@_date: 2017-01-25 01:54:47
I used blockchain.info
@_date: 2017-01-10 06:39:31
What’s wrong with BU?
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:27:53
gyft.com and egifter.com both work fine, I've bought a lot of gift cards from both sites and i've never faced an issue
@_date: 2017-04-06 23:20:39
There is a fee though? you put $ 0.32 which will be confirmed soon(1-2 hrs)
@_date: 2017-04-02 14:40:47
use blockchain.info instead
@_date: 2017-04-14 08:45:15

@_date: 2017-04-06 23:22:37
Have you tried to use viabtc transaction accelerator?
@_date: 2017-04-06 23:24:24
You don't have to, most wallets do that automatically, and your transaction has a fee which is weird why it isn't confirmed for 11 hours now.
@_date: 2017-04-03 23:46:55
Localbitcoins with Paypal, most of them just ask for a selfie of your ID and that's all, takes about 10 minutes.
@_date: 2017-10-29 08:49:36
Of course it's a throwaway posting this.. gosh its so easy getting to the front page of Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-09-16 18:17:25
As legit as it gets. Bought many Amazon and PSN cards from there and they never went bad.
@_date: 2017-10-26 05:57:58
I knew about bitcoin since 2014 and i own a few these days, and til this day I still don't understand why is btc price different on each website? isn't it supposed to be 1 price? 
@_date: 2017-10-12 18:15:21
screw them for siding with them in the first place
