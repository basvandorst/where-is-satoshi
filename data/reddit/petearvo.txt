I'm only a few months in to Bitcoin and I beleive in it but what I think is holding back Bitcoin is the anonymity side of it.. Will governments allow Bitcoin to thrive.. If governments cannot see the who, were, or why of currency , how are they going to collect taxes..There not going to really on self reporting.. Do you think there should be a system were by every wallet should be registered or something like that .. I think if this issue was resolved then Bitcoin could be unleashed.. What do you guys think .. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 22:39:28
Yes..Replace the USD..
@_date: 2017-10-13 22:33:16
Yes.. Replace fiat..
