I really hope he means the original with Charlton Heston and not the crap remake with James Franco.

I transfer money from my account (PNC) to my wife's (Fifth Third) regularly.  Unless we initiate the transfer on a Friday afternoon, funds are normally available within 24hrs.  Problem is whatever bank is sending the funds on your end.
However, to play devil's advocate, I am still waiting on my 0.15 BTC to transfer from my MtGox account.....just sayin.

I really hate the "cost of bread" argument.  I am not saying that currency inflation does not exist, but this argument attempts to use the cost of a manufactured good to demonstrate it.
In 1913, there was no mass produced pre-sliced bread as you would purchase in todays supermarkets.  If you were not producing bread at home, you would purchase it from a local independent baker.  The cost of producing said loaf was relatively low compared to the large commercial bakeries of today.
A better comparison would be the cost per metric ton of wheat.

Well I think people need to read the rest of his comment before offering a response:
" I say "increasingly" because at one time it was fairly well-informed libertarians but as the currency has become mainstream, it's attracted more poorly-informed individuals and the conversation have become more polarized and less knowledge-based, driving the well-informed and balanced people away, or at least prompting them to recede into the background."

Trustworthy how?  Are they going to insure your investment?

I understand your premise, however, your analogy is flawed.

This is what absolutely drives me mad about this subreddit.  Someone criticizes Bitcoin and the immediate reaction is a series of ad hominem attacks on the individual that made said criticism.
Was Krugman wrong about the internet in 1998?  Sure, but a lot of very intelligent people were as well.  Krugman made a prediction based on the information that was available to him.  It was an educated, albeit inaccurate, prediction.  Krugman is a brilliant, Noble winning economist that is right more often than not.
If you thing that what Krugman said on Bitcoin is wrong, attack the merits of his argument, not something he said 15 years ago.
