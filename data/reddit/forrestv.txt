I know it's not pretty, SexWithAGoat; it's unstyled HTML that I threw together.
I'm working on porting  from Windows Azure to a more amicable platform, and after that's done I'm going to centralize all information there, using its prettier style.

I (core P2Pool dev) just updated  with a tutorial with pictures for getting P2Pool running.

P2Pool should be background service, not an interactive program, so I think a web GUI (like the one it currently has) is appropriate... For a lot of people (most?), it will be running on a headless server and people will only access it remotely.
There's some argument for making it easier to configure, but that's already really easy - the default configuration (double-clicking run_p2pool.exe) is usually all you need, and if you need more, you can make a shortcut to it with a few extra arguments.

Can you define "p2p cloud mining service" for me? You mean a service that hosts miners and charges people for using them..?

It looks like brainwallet's transaction generator automatically creates a change output. That might be a recent change, though.

Hey, I'm the developer of P2Pool (there's really no operator, it being decentralized). As others here have said, the fee from your transaction was immediately distributed to 399 different addresses of miners.
You could solicit payment back on  on Freenode or the [forum thread]( Including something signed with your key would help, as nullc mentioned. You might get a couple bitcoins back.
Sorry for your loss.

I got screwed in the same way for about the same amount, and no amount of talking to them could get them to refund it. In fact, during my dispute, they changed the ToS to reinforce their position. They seemingly try to hid the existence of the deposit fee until too late. Very dirty company...
[old ToS]( [new ToS]( Look at Liability-&gt;Your Liability. This was added while I was talking to them:
