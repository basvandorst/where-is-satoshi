Is it really a crash if the price is still over 3x what it was in september?
Btw, what do you think is causing this massive downspike? Are people just trying to get rich quick with other cryptos?
@_date: 2018-01-23 19:58:35
This is incredible.

did you just reply to your own reply to yourself? 
@_date: 2018-01-24 00:22:50
but what if you could double down, buy the town of southpark back from those india---err I mean native americans, AND be stinkin rich?

These altcoins are directly tangible to holders of bitcoin. So far im getting that a lot of people have no idea that they are coming into even more money just by owning bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-05 06:34:38
You think it was a smart idea to kill yourself because, if you didn't do something in the past, you'd be rich?
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:22:32
ah I see. I was referring to Mycelium's miners fee.

exactly what im talking about.
Look it up for the exact dates, but the exact same way that Bitcoin cash and bitcoin gold came about, you will be given equal amount of the new currency (except bitcoin diamond you will be given 10x the amount since it is 10x the blocks of bitcoin). They are already projected to be worth hundreds. Its worth it for you to do research.

I dont get it. If people are supposidly "panicking" about price drops. Why dont you let them? Who gives a shit and perhaps it will allow us to buy more for cheaper.
@_date: 2017-12-15 06:40:11
Segwit doesn't solve the problem though. If anything, it is just temporary relief until we run into the *next* problem.
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:05:22
Will keep this in mind. I'm only aware of their existence at this point so I don't know the dangers.
@_date: 2018-09-13 22:53:51
I dont understand why an opponent of BCH has to stoop down to the same level as the perpetrators. The article is awful and comes off as snide. The author says that the app is "consistently getting 1 star reviews".
1. It has way more 5 stars than 1 stars
2. More importantly, who fuckin cares? If bots can write reviews/comments for millions of americans during an election, im sure there are bots that exist on the app store writing reviews. And even if not, its red vs blue. People go out of their way to attack the other team.
@_date: 2017-12-04 11:56:51
is there nothing else to talk about on this sub or something?
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:11:06
Why are you even reading articles like this? It's cosmopolitan - completely useless. I mean fuck, it's been like less than 2 weeks since the price drop.
@_date: 2017-12-05 06:24:12
Sorry for your loss; your brother is a dumbass. I hope there was a more valid reason for his misery.
@_date: 2017-12-16 04:19:22
Okay just make sure when the splits happen that you own no bitcoin so you wont have to get any.
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:09:21
Predicting based on past trends? Peak kek!. So youre saying that one day it will be worth infinkty dollars?
@_date: 2017-12-23 11:14:05
I agree. All the post telling people to stop worrying and shit too is ridiculous clutter.

I don't know man. The police confiscated hundreds of thousands of bitcoins just taking out websites like Alpha bay and silk road. They will be in control.
@_date: 2017-12-16 04:18:18
Thats a funny comment considering BCH goes for $2400 canadian right now and this was a fork exactly like I'm reffering to now. Whats Etherum and litecoin go for right now? oh... a fraction of the value.
@_date: 2017-12-27 07:36:13
a LOT of people jumped on board for the "get rich quick" scheme.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:11:37
Okay I'm already predicting that this is still going to be the case. regardless if you YOURSELF told EVERYBODY in the U.S AND they understood it.
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:46:28
Ahahahahahahahahaha why would somethink that MICROSOFT would call THEM to fix their computers.
@_date: 2017-12-16 04:13:45
Sure. Might I ask you if you think BCH and BTG are junk? Because one is worth thousands and one is worth hundreds. Holders of bitcoin at the time of the forks got equal value in the coins. Too bad if you were late to the party.
@_date: 2017-12-18 08:33:32




Meh it's not that staggering. If anything, it's worse now because the coin dropped more value than the other dip.
@_date: 2018-08-03 19:40:35
Not fun.
@_date: 2018-10-08 02:23:18


Lmfao. Author of the article is a boss.
@_date: 2018-10-10 23:09:29
Isnt it better that it has leveled off? I was always more nervous last year with the constant price swings.
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:39:00
Make me.
@_date: 2017-11-03 07:16:07
Naw I ended up finding them on the block chain and importing to another wallet. I have abandoned Armory now.
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:39:42
I think I have some bcash from like 0.1 bitcoin I had several mo ths ago. I think i should trade it for bitcoin now.
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:17:42
Make me.
@_date: 2017-11-20 01:08:26
Join the club. Canadian is over 10 grand.
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:00:33
I used localbitcoin, but i dont know how much I trust the online payment section. I just message to meet someone and do the trade then.
So the one time I tried to do it electronically, once the guy sent the email transfer, it kept saying "an unexpected error occured". Eventually we just cancelled the trade but for some reason interac-e transfer blocked my bank account from sending and recieving on suspicion of fraud. Wtf? I had to speak to several people and provide proof that I was jist trying to sell bitcoin.
Dont know what the plan with that was, but fuck that.
@_date: 2018-02-12 00:05:32
Hard to want to listen to people who obviously own bitcoin to just say it will go up.
@_date: 2018-03-08 23:21:19
Im more worried about trezor going offline for some reason.
@_date: 2018-03-06 23:51:03
Its twitter and its free so who cares? Just make a new account.
@_date: 2017-09-10 19:21:25
The truth is that it is very pathetic when people spread memes of "be like Bob and don't panic" because they are just trying to save their own ass.
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:48:42
I invested $1000 in monero when it was 15 bucks each and I watched it plummet to 4 dollars over the course of 4 months. When it finally climbed back to its value, i traded it for bitcoin than sold it for cash. If i just held out for 1 year, I would of had 20x the amount instead of just 3.
@_date: 2018-03-29 13:53:39
How come youre downvoting everyone who replies to you?
@_date: 2018-03-06 23:55:34
My advice would be to store the money under your matress.
@_date: 2017-09-29 20:07:47
Yeah, sell them to me for cheap.
@_date: 2018-03-08 03:24:10
is trezor a bad place to keep bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:47:51
I'm confused. Some guy says bitcoin is cool and all of the sudden it's landmarking?
@_date: 2018-02-06 18:14:56
It had nothing to do with my bank. Interac E-transfer is another company entirely and they are the ones that put a block on my account.
I know this because my bank couldn't do shit. I had to solve this directly with interac and provide proof that I wasn't up to anything nefarious (emails between my and the bitcoin seller).
@_date: 2017-10-19 17:05:03
Remember that if people are holding on their coin and not using it, especially if nobody is buying or selling, the price will go down as demand dies. Also, prices increase with lack of coin. Im not even sure if half the people on this subreddit use bitcoin at all. Not everyone will become rich. The money has to come frkm somewhere, so eventually a bubble will be hit. We just don't know when.
@_date: 2018-02-12 00:04:09
Competitors or people totally ingrained in one mindset dont give good advice.

@_date: 2018-04-29 20:30:41
Still makea no sense. This would make millionaires billion aires, and billiknaires into trillionaires. 
To all those holdjbg a few bitcoin, it seem nice. But to those who hold thousands, it makes no sense to me where all this money comes from.
@_date: 2018-04-30 22:20:46
No, im saying that there is no way that bitcoin will go for 500,000 in the next few years. It will take a hell of a lot longer than 2 years to reach that.
@_date: 2017-06-11 06:31:55
thank god. I thought i lost all that money

I did this and now it seems to be online. I'm curious though because I sent some bitcoin ($150 worth) to my wallet before it was online. Is the money gone for good?
@_date: 2017-06-18 20:54:16
i would ditch it and get anothet wallet
@_date: 2018-12-30 18:18:29
Haha my girlfriend is gonna hear about this.
@_date: 2017-06-11 03:56:41
Well I generated a receiving address while i was in offline mode and sent to that. I've been online for a few hours and I have no bitcoin. I notice every time i get a receiving address, it is different.
