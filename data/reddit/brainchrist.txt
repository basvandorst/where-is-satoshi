Well you did specifically ask how else would we could use the blockchain. Solutions like lightning still use the blockchain but are theoretically capable of scaling up to a much higher number of transactions without recording every last one on the blockchain itself.

You are going to have a really hard time finding figuring out the "lost" coins, since nobody knows how many coins are lost for sure. You can look up all kinds of statistics on coin movement, but nobody definitely knows which coins are "lost" forever.
I'm not sure what you mean by block limit. Also there is massive uncertainty as to the # of transactions due to adoption, transaction fee changes, and other stuff. I don't even know how relevant the statistic is due to people moving their own coins around or laundering them.

They don't get to dictate anything though, the only get to try to establish consensus within the community. If they implement something that is horrible for bitcoin or more directly the miners, people are free to run other implementations besides bitcoin core. There may be a fork or other bad problems, but as it is the devs don't get to 100% decide anything.

@_date: 2015-08-20 18:36:54
Because really there are two definitions of "fork point".
1) BitcoinXT exists as a fork of Bitcoin Core. As in they can now develop in separately because they are in different repositories.
2) BitcoinXT is designed to follow the same rules as bitcoin core until 750/1000 of the last blocks are mined by BitcoinXT clients. Then all XT miners will start accepting 8mb blocks, which will get rejected by Bitcoin Core.
Situation 1 is a code fork, situation 2 is a blockchain fork. The code is similar enough between XT and Core that they can mine on the same blockchain for now.

@_date: 2015-08-20 18:53:36
You're really confused. The whole reason they are waiting for 75% consensus is so that there won't be a "new coin". It'll just be bitcoin with 8mb blocks. And then the last 25% of holdouts should switch over pretty rapidly because their fork of the chain will obviously, by definition of when the switchover happens, be less popular.
There is no software switching happening. The code is already written and people who are running it have all the code. The change isn't really applicable to "other softwares" because you don't need consensus to patch adobe reader or something.

Well he wasn't trying to be a jackass, so don't be so defensive. People have studied this for a long time, and your question just doesn't make sense. Dwolla may have helped a lot of people buy bitcoin, but it has nothing to do with whether or not bitcoin can be trusted. Bitcoin itself is the protocol and actual currency system that is completely detached from dwolla or even any trade sites. 
To answer your question, so far bitcoin has proven itself reliable. Nothing bad that has happened to bitcoin users or trade sites is because of flaws or security problems with bitcoin. Hopefully that clears up some confusion and helps you understand why people are reacting the way they are.

Anyone care to weigh in on this? I didn't think this was really an intended feature of bitcoin. To me it sounds like they are saying it's technically possible to alter the growth algorithm, just like it would be technically possible for the developers of the software to do pretty much anything since they are in control of the source code. For example, release a bitcoin client that takes all your bitcoins and sends them around the network randomly. But my understanding was that unless enough people actually adopt the client, the algorithm would remain unchanged.
TL;DR I don't think the paper is right in calling bitcoin fiat because they don't have a fixed quantity. They do have a finite supply.

Alternatively, adopting bitcoin could drive people to your market. There aren't a ton of uses for bitcoin as of now, and the user base is heavily skewed towards traders and investors.
Edit - I'm not really sure how your market is supposed to work though. How does information translate into higher share value? Is the market based off of supply and demand, or are the share prices set by the content creators? I'm just confused where the money is coming from for dividends and increased share prices as websites 'add information'.

Orphans are blocks that are initially thought to be valid, but the network later rejects them. 
So if I put a fake transaction into the network with a small hashing power, it would be "orphaned" because I couldn't fake enough of the network and everyone else would know it was false. Alternatively with &gt;50% of the hashing power, you can orphan blocks because you can dictate to everyone else what is true.
Alternatively, when mining, you can find a block that appears to be good, but the network later tells you that someone found the block before you and your block will be orphaned.
Someone else may be able to explain the intricacies better, but I believe that is the basic idea.

Well best of luck to you. I have a hard time imagining a market where the price isn't set based on supply and demand. For example, if my shares go up from 1 to 5 btc based on a bunch of improvements on a website, there are probably going to be less transactions because of the higher price of shares. And fewer transactions likely means less revenue for me and future investors. Who is going to want to buy more expensive shares if their purchase will only further raise the price and lessen the likelihood of revenue? 
If users selling the shares set the price themselves, then the information value is pretty much removed and it becomes more of a pure ponzi. It's a weird concept to me, but I hope you can figure something out that works.

It doesn't have to do with an attack on a website, it is actually a way of attacking the bitcoin (or similar blockchain based) service. If you control 51% of the hashing power (mining), then you are allowed to change certain rules of the network since you are the majority of verifications. People used to think it was just potentially double spending, but recently some exploit came to light that would've allowed reversal of transactions and other major changes. Someone recently threatened to attack one of the smaller blockchains, called namecoin, but the attack was called off. Hope that kind of clears things up.

I don't have an estimate for you as far as the energy cost goes, but personally I would not drop out if the ratio falls below 1. I'd count on the possibility that others would drop out, then mining would get easier, and when the price rises back up I could sell for a profit.

Assuming this is a real question, and not just rhetorical stuff to provoke people into rethinking their beliefs, I'm going to give you an answer.
People assume that the current price is due to uncertainty. If we had a crystal ball and could see into the future, we could assume one of two scenarios. Either bitcoin fails somehow, or adoption increases dramatically. Most people don't think it is very likely that bitcoin stays niche forever, which is what it seems like you are suggesting. ~250 would suggest that bitcoin stays niche for the near term, while the higher prices would suggest less uncertainty and therefore more confidence that bitcoin adoption will increase.

Yeah your scheme doesn't work because if you get the coins back with a 1% commission, then you would have to report that as profit. EDIT: I see what you mean now. You are just lowering the cost basis of the coins you hold. I guess this works in the short term, but at some point if you want to legitimately cash out to fiat, you'll end up paying just as much as you claimed as losses.
You're better off just making everything up, avoiding the theoretical 1% fee, and praying you don't get audited. Because if you do, you're probably fucked either way.

@_date: 2013-04-01 19:26:33
My advice to you is no. Especially not right now. It is highly unlikely (imho obviously) that the price will continue to rise like this in the short term. If you want to invest in bitcoins, it should be for the long term. And if you want to invest in the long term, wait for the price to stabilize for like a week at least. If you put money down right now, there is a very high risk that you would lose money in the short term.  I would wait til the bubble pops. 
Also if you pay off some of that student loan, you know exactly how much you will be making/saving. Likely 7%/year if you have unsubsidized ones, maybe higher if you took out more than federal loans.

Assuming you are really asking this question:
That graph means that if we lose momentum, it is a lot easier for the price to slide back to $71 (~1200btc buy orders filled) rather than move up to $75 (~7900btc sell orders filled). Basically you can just see how hard it is going to be for the price to keep moving up or down, depending on the height of the line. A flat line on either side means the price *could* move in that direction very quickly.

Since bitcoin is such a small market and the quantity is known, I personally think an increase in price is the cause of the increase in price. The original cause was definitely more websites accepting bitcoin and people realizing that it probably isn't just a passing fad. But I think it is a little out of control right now.
I'm not sure if there have been any real world studies apart from general studies on free market behavior.

I don't think this really makes any sense at all.
1) There are transaction and trading fees. You are losing money each time you make a transaction.
2) Nobody cares if you sell bitcoins to yourself. It literally has no effect on any market, or anyone else buying or selling bitcoins.

One day I hope to see this headline again with a different meaning.

The coins are indeed gone, and both of your suspicions are correct. After coins stop being generated that is.
If bitcoins weren't divisible to really small units, this would actually be a problem.

I think that is pretty close to the general consensus. I would slightly modify your statement to read: new investors mostly drive the short term growth but increased adoption by merchants and individuals will drive the long term growth, potentially to extremely high levels.

I understand where you are coming from, but coinbase is having a hard enough time serving their current customers for the time being. I don't know that they need to increase referral incentives.

Yeah, without an ASIC miner (specialized hardware), it's pretty impossible to make any meaningful amount of bitcoin. Generally if you are mining with your computer, you are going to be losing money due to the cost of electricity. And yes, due to how they are set up, many alt coins can be mined with a GPU still because nobody has developed specialized hardware for them yet.

One bitcoin = $1 billion. ONE BILLION.

Your questions are pretty misguided. I'd suggest reading through the FAQ or the Getting Started guides in the sidebar.

They are pretty in line with bitstamp, btce, campbx, and others. Gox is just higher than everyone as usual.

Yes! You aren't stupid, the whole thing is very confusing. 
[Here's an example of a block that was mined today]( You can see in the "Block Reward" the number of new coins created as part of this block. In the "Transaction Fees" field is the "bonus" you are referring to. That is basically the sum of all transaction fees that were paid since the last block was mined.

Obviously nobody knows, but most people here will tell you that it is a smart choice. This is after all.

It's harder/easier to get money in and out of certain exchanges.
For example, there are concerns about liquidity of Mt Gox. There was a report that the US Government seized a bunch of money from Mt Gox. People are concerned they won't be able to get USD out eventually, so they are buying bitcoin and withdrawing those since it is instant. That drives the price of bitcoins up slightly on that exchange.

This is true. Also at $17, $5 and $1. Its a volatile market that people with no extra money and large amounts of debt probably should stay away from. Nothing wrong with dicking around with a couple hundred dollars if you can spare it, but I wouldn't consider it as a serious investment if I was already significantly in debt.

Personal story here - coinbase did that to me on this current price rise. I then contacted support and they not only whitelisted me for the future but reinstated my old purchase at ~$100 below current market price. Pretty satisfied overall.

Bitcoins are NOT infinite. The transaction fees are just what you pay from already existing bitcoins when you move bitcoins.
Think of it as a tax that goes to the miners, who help sustain the network by confirming transactions. When you pay a tax, no new money gets created, it just gets skimmed off the top of a transaction.

I think they maybe intentionally disabled their ticker data while they figure out DDOS and traffic stuff. The ticker on [bitcoincharts]( is down too, so I don't think you are doing anything wrong.

There are a lot of good links in the sidebar to answer noobie questions like this. But basically there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins. We slowly approach that number until the year 2140. New coins are mined every 10 minutes. Right now every 10 minutes 25 coins are mined. "Mining" refers to people using special computer hardware to solve a sophisticated math problem. Whoever solves it first gets the coins.

It depends where you live. [Coinbase]( is really simple if you are in the USA though. You just have to link a bank account up, and you can purchase with funds from there. The downside is that you have to wait a few days for the funds to clear and to get your bitcoins, but if you aren't trading often then it shouldn't be a problem.
Full disclosure: That link is my personal referral link.

To answer your other question, there are transaction fees that are paid every time you send coins. They are pretty small, but the thought is that by the time coins stop being generated, the transaction fees will be enough of a reward for people to keep mining.
@_date: 2013-04-05 13:02:41
But why wouldn't we take any steps we can to reduce the risk of double spends? I don't get your argument.
Bad stuff is going to happen eventually, so let's just let it happen sooner?
I don't think anyone is saying that disaster can ONLY be averted by switching pools, but it certainly avoids a potential problem in this specific scenario.
