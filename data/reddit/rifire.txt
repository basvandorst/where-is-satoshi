Only if you sell at a profit.  And like bitcoin, a trade works just like a sale, you need to treat it like a sale at market value (and a separate purchase of whatever you traded for).

I just wish I hadn't lost my hardware wallet in a boating accident.

You are supposed to pay capital gains on gold and silver.

Did you not read the entire article you linked to?  They literally used a home as an example of an asset.

Not for an inheritance.

I'd rather take the extremely small chance that my financially secure parents decide to steal from me than guarantee that an asset dies with me.

My parents have my 2nd Trezor, the pin described in a way they'll understand, and contact info for a friend that I trust and would be able to help them turn it into dollars.

If you've won the game, you can stop playing.  You can afford to be more risk averse.
There's more of a time/education commitment to investing in crypto than there is for most traditional asset classes.  You have to figure out how to securely store it, you need to figure out which exchanges aren't sketchy, you need to jump through whatever hoops those exchanges need you to jump through to deposit money.  That's often not worth it to someone whose quality of life wouldn't be majorly impacted by even a 1000% gain on 1 bitcoin.

I wouldn't call it such a sure thing.  Lots of entrepreneurs fail.  You just hear more about the massive successes.

Do you trust your wife?

Yeah, understood.
In this case, the money isn't really a significant amount for the friend or for my family so I'm not really worried.
