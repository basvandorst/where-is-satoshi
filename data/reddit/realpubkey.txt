I don't agree on BU. But also I think segwit was a very nasty idea because it splits the community into exactly 2 sides.
Why didnt they do a BIP for every single segwit feature, so we can discuss them one after another?
Also saying that someone else has a "bullshit-opinion" and so his arguments don't count is just stupid as we learned in the last U.S.-election and as we will learn in germany 2018.

My advice for strangers on the internet:
"BUY BITCOIN AND HODLE NO MATTER WHAT. YOU WILL BECOME BAZILLIOAIRE TOMORROW"
My advice for friends and familiy:
Do not buy bitcoin if you don't understand the basic principles. Only invest what you can afford to lose.

No. That is not true. Tx-speed does not affect the centralisation. Not in btc and not in other cryptos.

Most of them are open-source. Thats means you should create a pull-request instead of complaining here.
