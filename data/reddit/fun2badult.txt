My emails were answered few weeks agreed sending and this was just login issue as they suspended my account for no reason. Finally they got back to me and I was able to login. I still have a $2000 wire transfer to gdax that I’m still waiting on, almost a month after sending it in. Coinbase has bunch of idiots working there

Would you rather lose 50% or 90%
@_date: 2018-01-15 08:44:06
Wouldn’t the number be stuck on a same number after some time

Can some people take this douchebag scam artist down?

You do know stealing means when someone takes something from you without your permission right? How is it not stolen when someone takes your bitcoin by getting your wallet key? Someone transferred your coins but not stealing? So if I take your wallet when you’re not looking, I’m not stealing, just transferring right? ��‍♂️
There’s a 0% chance of you losing bitcoin? Think again. If you have a piece of paper with your key on it, someone can steal your bitcoin. Nowadays there’s articles saying people have actually succeeded in taking your coins even if it’s in a cold wallet away from the internet. If you lose that paper with your key on it, kiss those bitcoins good bye forever because no one will be able to access it unless that key is found. That in itself is also dangerous because all your coins are relying on you not losing that paper
In addition, a person can put the coins into a cold wallet like a usb drive and think it’s safe. Have you heard of people who threw away their usb by mistake and now is searching a landfill looking for that usb? 
As much as I think crypto is the future as I have some on my own, losing it has a higher probability than having a vault full of gold bars

Tell that to the hackers who can hack into your emails, or install malware for key logging, somehow finding out you have bitcoin based on messages and website visits.

I’ve been seeing articles recently stating that even hardware wallet can be hacked. In addition, how can you be 100% sure that the hardware wallet you purchased has never been tempered with? Even by the company that sells it? Nothing is 100% fool proof. That’s why there’s an article where they talk about rich people keeping it in a cold wallet stored in a vault in a mountain side

Gold will always have value no matter how big crypto gets. Gold is a metal that can be shaped into anything and is also used for circuits, etc. gold can’t be destroyed where as crypto currency can be lost forever

So when is McAfee going to eat his dick?
@_date: 2018-05-25 20:27:49
That’s one use but the malleability of gold as metal is why it was valuable in the first place hundreds of years ago, not to mention it being used as jewelry 
@_date: 2018-05-25 21:40:04
Yea but most people aren’t that knowledgeable or cautious enough I think.

How can you easily seize all the gold bars?it doesn’t take seconds like bitcoin
@_date: 2018-05-25 21:10:04
Is that how a douchebag looks like?
@_date: 2018-05-25 18:02:46
Well technically one can be stolen in few seconds while the other will take a while 
@_date: 2018-05-25 20:03:04
Really? Because as long as anyone gets a hold of your wallet key then anyone can just transfer your money in a second. Even if people know where your gold is, it just can’t be stolen like that. They would need trucks and lot of people which would take time 
@_date: 2018-05-25 20:41:09
Sure I’ll give you that it’s rare (only because we haven’t dug all the land) and durable. However, I still stand by the fact that gold will always have value 
@_date: 2018-05-24 06:28:10
Still dipping fml
@_date: 2018-05-25 21:35:31
Yea I agree as long as one takes good precautions in storing the coins, the probability of losing is would be low 
@_date: 2019-11-13 15:57:58

You do know if there’s ever an asteroid hitting the earth  and destroying a lot of the stuff, or a nuclear war, or some kind of electrical grid issue where we lose all electrical power, or some unforeseen future disasters, gold will still be there even after this right? 
If there’s no power, no electricity, how is an electronic money be useful? Gold is something physical you can use it as a tool regardless of the condition of the human tech. It’s malleable that can be turned into many different things. It has its value as a tool rather than as just money. It has an intrinsic value that can’t be destroyed
@_date: 2019-08-15 05:33:22
Asteroid is not the only thing that can bring physical havoc to this planet. I didn’t say bitcoin isn’t worth investing if the world is fine, I’m saying it’s worthless if the world goes to shit. Gold always had intrinsic value to be used as a tool, etc
@_date: 2018-06-11 17:25:59

Nuclear war is pulling scenarios out of my ass? Do you know what’s going on in the world? Did you know Pakistan and India might go to war and they both have nukes? Gold doesn’t have value in an apocalyptic world after nuclear wars? Ever heard of using gold instead of copper for wiring or other electronic needs? You know you can make spoons and tools out of gold since it’s malleable? Also it can be turned into a bowl, rod, etc, things that are useful for life. Gold had value long before technology was around. 
So you say if the world goes to shit, people will be demanding for bitcoin because it can do what in those situations? You think people surviving for food and life are going to be going around collecting bitcoins? 
If the world doesn’t go to shit then bitcoin would replace gold and usd. As an investment it’s a great thing. 
But if the world goes to shit? I would rather have gold than bitcoin. You say bitcoin is an energy powerhouse? What does that mean? It used up energy to create it. It doesn’t dispense energy. If correct run, it can do more? What do you mean? If there’s no power grid, then gold has value, bitcoin does not. Gold always has been around long before electricity was

Is he willing to eat his dick though if it doesn’t 
@_date: 2018-07-04 07:10:08
I think you misread it. I buy high, then it goes to low when I’m holding it, then after I sell it , goes back up to high
