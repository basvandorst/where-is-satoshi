(a) It hasn't been proven to do this. You're confusing "that's how it's been for the last 2 millenia" and "it should be done this way". Actual socialist health care is almost always a shit show, just ask Cuba. Just ask Canada, who just recently had to invent "super hospitals" (read: normal hospitals). 
(b) Forcing people ***by gunpoint*** to pay for services they don't want is EVIL. Not "civilised" not "the best way", but EVIL.


Yeah, and look at where that got us. We're a fucking world-wide empire that spends 40,000 bucks on a hammer. Everyone I know in the military talks about how horrifically run the military is. They just shut up, though, because they want their benefits.
I mean, you're actually looking at the US military and using it as a PLUS for socialism? Jesus Christ, man. Wake up.


No, because you can choose which company you buy from.
See how that works? Companies that suck at paying out benefits lose money in the long run.
When a government does it, they just increase taxes, put a few bucks in their friends pockets, and then go back to raping 12 year olds.


This argument applies to your preferred system as well. You just replace "Shareholders" with "Taxpayers".


... Basic economics?
Classic liberals: "if we tax cigarettes and soda, people will drink less because it costs more!"... "if we make health care cost nothing for anyone, then ... nothing will change because magical faeries".
Go read "Economics in One Lesson" By Henry Hazlitt, or "Basic Economics", by Thomas Sowell. You clearly haven't been taught real economics (duh. The government doesn't want you to understand real economics, that's why they teach the Keynesian Bullshit).


It may be surprising to you, "chum", but if you're asking for a separation of money and state, but giving the government a reach-around for the joining of state and health care, then you're not ideologically consistent.
Repeat: You're obviously not ideologically consistent. I've never met a socialist who was.

Each node independently verifies all transactions. 
When someone says "bob gave sally 3btc", your node goes through the entire blockchain to say "that transaction CAN occur because bob has 3 btc, and so the tx is valid".
Each node makes it one step more impossible for any government or bankster to become THE verifier of transactions.
Decentralization of nodes is important to keep bitcoin safe from a specific attack - a central authority attack.
Nodes make bitcoin trustless, that is, you need not trust a 3rd party to verify that the person giving you money has the money they say they do.

No, it's how socialists run their health services. That's literally the definition of a socialized service.


Not entirely true. They choose which treatments are required *that are also listed as appropriate by the NHS*. There is a sort of a "protocol" that is given to doctors via the head-medical institute in most countries (in the US it's the AMA). So the doctors are only allowed to choose to do what's on the list.
The government - the NHS - chooses what's on the list.


Indeed. And to keep costs lower than they should be (after all, if you know everyone else is going to pay for your broken arm, why SHOULDN'T you play rugby?), they offer doctors less than their market value.
Thus, your best and brightest are going into other fields for higher salaries.
So, to recap:
* Your doctors are less skilled than they should be
* They are told what care to provide via a bureaucratic nightmare of a top-down approach
* No one feels the need to take responsibility for their actions (well, LESS responsibility)
* To make sure that prices don't go too high, the government has a MASSIVE incentive to dictate how you run your life via food taxes, smoking laws, etc.
Give me freedom every day of the week.
And just to make sure we stay on topic:
Crypto currencies were created to kill the gatekeepers and to separate state from money. It's disgusting that people here in the Crypto community are asking for gatekeepers in the realm of health care, and are asking for the two to be joined at the hip.

What about the Irish? Or the Slavic slaves of the Muslims? Or the Chinese slaves of the Japanese? Or the [Insert every race of people] who were enslaved by [Insert a different race of human].
Try renting an apartment in Japan. Try "being white and walking down the street" in Japan.


Maybe, JUST MAYBE, that "continued racist climate they experience" is actually "a lot of black people suck at working hard". Maybe, JUST MAYBE, about 40% of all violent crimes in the US are caused by 6% of the population: black men.
I said it earlier: it's not racist if it's true. I know plenty of black people who are great, and I know plenty of black people who I wouldn't invite in my home.
Same for whites, asians, and every other racial group.


Quite a few, actually. You're stripping free-will from an entire race of people by saying that all their shitty behavior is because of white people.


Yes it is. You only think it isn't because you think RACE is the problem, not CULTURE. I'm pointing out that CULTURE is what's important, not RACE.
YOU'RE THE RACIST.


Whites were enslaved by blacks in Africa - the word "Slave" comes from the Slavic people. Yet, many whites have their shit together. Culture is more important than race, and ***you're trying to keep the black culture as "blame whitey"***.
G'head and talk to black kids - I did when I taught in an inner city school - they hate this "white people are the reason we're oppressed" idea. They're ALSO pissed off whenever they see a movie with "white person comes into inner city school to save the black kids from ghetto-ness".

There's no way you live in the US and ACTUALLY think the USD is only decreasing 3% per year.

It's better than the ever-changing definition of price inflation that the government shits out.

Of course not. They don't want you to think that things are getting more expensive.

Of course 1 and 2 have always been true - it's impossible for it not to be true via logic (albeit, I should have not used the word money in  wealth would have been better).
And so, 3 has to be true, because it's simply defining "how to profit in futures trading".
Thus, all 3 being true, 4 is also true.


Indeed! I agree.
It will be MORE stable in a year, and a huge function of the new stability will be because of futures trading.
It will be a wild few months, followed by boring roller coasters.
*I really think it'll be interesting as the futures market of bitcoin begins to rise BEFORE currency manipulation in other countries*. It will be fascinating to see BTC go up in value for 'no reason' and then a week later, Germany announces it has to lower interest rates by 40% or some shit.

People here are saying that futures don't stabilize prices.
That can't make sense, by definition.
People trade for one reason and one reason only: to profit. This is ***undeniably*** true: if you attempt to refute it, you are proving it correct. That is, by saying "I don't plan on profiting", you are profiting. 
When you sell $5 to someone for a cheeseburger, you are literally saying "I value that cheeseburger more than $5", and the person selling the burger is saying "I value the $5 more than this cheeseburger."
By definition - repeat: By the very definition of the words being used - both parties expect to be better off.
Going one step further: if people make bad trades (they expect to be better off, but they screw themselves over), they lose money and are less likely to make future screw ups.
Thus, people who predict the future the best are rewarded, and people who suck at predicting the future are punished.
This means, still by definition, that over time, people will be rewarded for making the spikes in price smaller.
Thus, volatility will decrease.

I'm personally against FRB, but I understand the other side of the issue (I think). Two people can't both have a legitimate claim to the same piece of property, thus FRB is theft.

If you watch exchanges, people promise to.sell X bitcoins at Y dollar price.
These are called limit orders.
The two never meet.
Eventually some guy says "fuck it, I'm just going to buy/sell some at whatever price these limits are, I don't care. i just want some btc/dollars now."
These are market orders.
Over the past week, people were making such gifantic market buys that sell limits couldn't even adjust. Thousands of bitcoin were being gobbled up in tenths of seconds.
Limit orders are usually 1 cent apart, but for entire minutes, the difference was in the multiple hundreds.
A buy order would come in and the.price would be 15600, then a sell order would come in a instantly change the price to 14650.
People are taking a breath right now. No one knows what thE fuck.just happened, and people are hoping to god that the trading will just stop for a little while.

No, the current Bcash doesn't use SegWit, and BTC's LN requires SegWit.

Coinbase - although "just" an exchange, and not a proper wallet - has a strong reputation for being safe.
Unfortunately, safety comes at the cost of hastiness.

It depends on their self-implemented reserve ratio, and how many coins they have.
Here's the equation:
(Number of BTC they have) X (1+(1/reserve ratio as a decimal) + (21million - Number of BTC they have) = total amount of BTC
If they have all 21 million, and they implement a 1% reserve ratio, there will be a total of 2.1 billion.
If they have "only" 1 million, and they implement a 50% reserve ratio, there will be a total of 22 million BTC.

Fractional reserve banking creates inflation.
Usually the banks keep about 10% of the money they have. If Coinbase is holding, say, 10 million Bitcoin, they'd lend out 9 million, while still claiming to hold all 10 million.
They'd instantly change the quantity of Bitcoin from 21million to 30 million.

@_date: 2018-05-23 18:08:41
Yes you can.
Jim puts 100 BTC in his Coinbase account. Coinbase knows he will only use about 10% on a daily basis. Thus, Coinbase will lend out up to 90 BTC.
The people receiving the money will spend the 90 BTC. The people who get the BTC will then put it into Coinbase. Coinbase knows that only 10% of it will be used, so they loan out 81 BTC.
... there is now 271 BTC, and no one notices because they only use 10% of their money on a daily basis.
Short of a "Coinbase run" (a bank run), off-chain ledgers can actually increase the supply of BTC.
The long of it is, if you put 100 BTC in, and CB has a reserve-ratio of 10%, there will be a grand total of 1000 BTC if no one runs the bank. If they play it safe and mandate a 50% reserve-ratio, then there will still be 200 BTC.

No. 
If you lend out 9 million BTC, and keep 1 million, but claim that you're still holding 10 million, there are now 19 million bitcoin in addition to the other 11 million out there.
This is literally how banks operate.
If they then lend to other "bitcoin banks", the other banks can do the same thing. Thus, if 21 million exists, then one bank lends out 90%, you'd end up with 39.9million, if people then put their claims into another "bitcoin bank", the new bank could add 90% of the newly created 18.9m, for a new total of  35.91 million.
Then, if they did the same thing again, you'd end up with even more.
Ultimately, the math works out to about a new sum total of 210 million BTC that's circulating.
@_date: 2018-05-23 19:07:47
Jesus fucking christ. How is everyone here so fucking dense.
If 21 million BTC exists, and it all gets shoved through a 10% reserve ratio-system thousands of times, there will be 21 million "REAL bitcoin", and there will be an additional 189 "fractional reserve bitcoin".
It's still bitcoin - people who say "we accept bitcoin" and don't differentiate --- ***and judging from the comments on this sub-reddit, 95% of people WILL NOT differentiate*** --- the "fake bitcoin" will be treated as "real bitcoin".

This is LITERALLY how ALL banks work. You borrow X amount of money, then put that money in the bank. 90% or so of that money is lent out, and the next person puts it in the bank, and the banks lends out 90% of that money.
You'll end up with roughly 210 million BTC in total on ledgers.

@_date: 2017-03-04 00:40:25


... see, you *say* that, but then I'm reminded of your intensely sarcastic comment:


So, I guess we'll find out exactly which type of person you are.
Ever since BC hit its new all-time high, I've been looking for a drop. There were a few, but the drops were negated very quickly.
There should've been a bigger drop in price, though - very few people see an investment and think 'I should buy it when it's the most expensive it has ever been' *unless* they have a reason to ignore that obviously bad issue.
You have to agree with this: buying something when it's the most expensive it has ever been is a terrible idea UNLESS there's a *significant* issue negating it.
Now, once again, there *were* drops, but they were immediately negated, and then followed *by a new all time high*!! I have 5 BC and I've made $1500 in under a month. *That's insane*. It's unsustainable.
So, obviously, there **is** a negating factor. It's pretty clear that this negating factor is "there is going to be an ETF decision soon."
So, everyone who's betting on a positive ETF decision are not only raising the price of BC, *but they're also preventing the price from dropping.*
If there's a positive decision, the price will probably spike up, and then fall back to a new high-average. That is, BC's average for a long time was a slow increase  from $300. We could probably see a steady increase from $1200 or so.
However, if the decision is negative, all the people who were hoping for the opposite are going to bail. *These were the same people who are raising the price of BC, AND keeping the price steady!!!*
When these people leave, you'll probably see a tank down to $800. Obviously I don't have a crystal ball, but whenever we saw an attempt at a correction at a new high, it dropped ~$30 in under a half of a day -- *and that was with people buying up hoping for an ETF decision*.
The drop after a negative decision could, with some significant degree of plausibility, be all the way down to a new price of $700.
At that point, it would obviously be a good buy, and the price will probably bottom out and start climbing.
... however, I might be wrong there, too. The last time there was an issue, BC lost 80% of its value. We might see a flock out of BC just like the last drop, but possibly even worse: people might actually completely give up on BC if it won't be recognized as an ETF. It *could* be worse.


I think, honestly, if the ETF decision is negative, we'll see a drop to at least $900, which, now, is a 33% drop. At the time of the decision, with the parabolic growth we're seeing, it could be a drop from $1600, making it almost a 50% drop.

1) it's actually not inflationary - there IS a limit, and when it hits that limit there can only be a loss of bitcoins. I'm aware we're not at that limit yet, but the fact that the limit exists makes it deflationary in the eyes of those who purchase it.
2) If you want to include my entire quote, or at least the next few words of it:

@_date: 2017-03-11 00:21:20


This isn't entirely accurate.
Everything you want to buy, you have to buy with dollars in the US. The US government controls the value of the dollar.
Bitcoin falls into this to an extent - most people have to buy bitcoin at this point - but not completely.
You can get started in BC by simply using electricity (which is, indeed, somewhat dependent on the price of the dollar).
However -- and correct me if I'm wrong here -- ***bitcoin is a currency***. You can literally trade a good or service for the bitcoin, thus completely by-passing the dollar altogether.
Is this *not* the ***entire*** point of bitcoin? 
I could've sworn that the entire point of bitcoin was to prevent the US from completely ruining people's wealth through inflation. If this isn't the point, why the hell would anyone put their money in this?

We're witnessing Gresham's Law in practice.
Bitcoin is one of the few currencies in the world that is actually INCREASING in value, rather than just falling slower than other currencies.
This creates a huge incentive to hold on to Bitcoin, but spend your dollars, yen, etc. 
People keep the good money, and get rid of the bad money - thus, it's very hard to actually use the good money in an economy that has both good and bad money.
It's interesting to see Bitcoin as "a currency that no one uses because we're all trying to hold onto it simply because we *think* other people will be willing to accept it in the future", but it actually makes economic sense.

And, not to be rude, but your analytical method of the price of BC is kind of nonsense.
The graph assumes that the price will continue to rise without any rhyme or reason. It just shows that "because it has been rising over time, it will continue to rise." 
If that's the case, then you should invest every penny you can afford into BC right now. In fact, everyone should. 
After all, if it's going to go up, then you should get the biggest percentage increase with the greatest base principle as soon as possible.
Unfortunately, Human Action isn't determined by such simple graphs -- otherwise, communism would actually work.

While every economics textbook was threatening Commie takeover until even a year after USSR admitted they were all starving, the Austrians were saying "bullshit, we call your bluff."
The Austrians also predicted every major economic downturn. Go watch Ron Paul in 2002 (I think) talk, in Congress, about the upcoming housing crash (in 2008). He PERFECTLY summarizes whaT WOULD happen 6 years early. 
The Austrians actually have a fantastic prediction record.

ACTULLY think about what a world where a single bitcoin was $50,000,000. 
Everyone would want it, inflation of fiat would be in double diguts, people would be flocking out of fiat, the economies would have already crashed, banks would be largely irrelevant...
... no, I would almost definitely not sell at $50,000,000. If it were worth $50m on Monday, it would probably be worth $70m on Wednesday.
I'd be more likely to sell at $50k than $50 mill because the horrendous crash wouldn't have happened yet.

Government is, by definition, a socialist endeavor. Thus, the statement:

Governments suck at spending money because it's not their money and they get no profits from spending it wisely, and they suffer no losses from spending it poorly. The people spending the money have to guess what the people want.
Mistakes are plentiful, and thus the post office, BMV, TSA security, and DC are all synonymous with "corrupt, slow, and incompetent".

This is also BS. 
Christ - and economics, but thousands of years later - taught us all that our desires are what control us. Hell, even Buddhists know this.
Atheism has made us all misunderstand that only we can control ourselves. The atheists call for new laws and a new government plan to save us from ourselves. "The new Communist Man" of the USSR was simply a religion of slavery with a false idol t the head.
Value comes from the heart/mind, so money only controls you as much as you let it.
Money is a wonderful thing that has helped billions of people live - you can't get a car, let alone a computer out of an economy without money.

No, the value lies in your mind. Everyone looks at the same thing and assigns it a different value.
Your ability to "produce work" with anything has nothing to do with its value. I can "produce work" with dead flies, yet I won't accept a gallon of them even if you paid me 50 cents to use them.

The benefits you gain from socialism are very visible: you see the welfare check, you SEE the police saving you, you SEE the roads being built, you SEE the free health care.
But you normalize the losses and fail to see them, the same way your brain is ignoring what's behind your computer screen / smart phone at this very instant. (Psst, what IS behind the screen? Do you remember what color your socks are? What's behind you right now? Did you forget about the belt you're wearing?)
You "forget" that you have 15% less money in your wallet than you otherwise would have. You don't see that a business didn't hire 10 people they could have. You don't see the products that the company can't build. You never see - and ***don't expect*** -- accountability from anyone in government when you WOULD if the same service were rendered by a private company.
It's "the seen vs. the unseen". Please read "Economics in One Lesson", by Henry Hazlitt.

That's not what taking the Lord's name in vain means.
And, I'm not "lambasting" anything. I'm pointing out a truth.
The OP says "money controls us, even though it's just paper". Christ - and so does the Subjective Theory of Value in economics (the current best explanation of how value is generated) -  points out that this is false in his Sermon on the Mount.

Net neutrality is bullshit, to begin with. How is the internet decentralized if the government can just demand that everyone behave a certain way?
That being said, a transaction only requires like... a few bits of bandwidth, so it wouldn't be a big deal. Nodes only have to send out 1mb of data every 10 minutes, so... it's not a big deal, I'd imagine.
Also, if net neutrality goes away, *people who can pay get better treatment* -- ISP's will be flooding to give bitcoin users more access, I'd imagine.

I'm shit faced there's so much negativity towards 2mb blocks. I know it's supposed to be "grr, some guys think something so angry!", but there's no way in hell BTC is going to do anything significant by staying at 1mb.
I also think BCH is moronic for avoiding SegWit. It's impossible to think they'll achieve anything significant by simply increasing block size forever.
The Core Dev team is doing a great job, and I want them to keep doing their thing, but let's be real: we're going to have 2mb blocks eventually. $3 tx costs are stupid.

Jaxx is nice, but it doesn't allow you to set your own transaction fee.
I'd recommend, at least for BTC, something that allows you to choose your own tx fee - Mycellium, I'm pretty sure, lets you. After the mempool clears, if the transaction isn't important, you can pay just a few dimes and still get it on block by the end of the day.
But, only use those for "daily spending". If you have malware on your phone, someone might be able to record your keys, or take screenshots without your knowledge.

@_date: 2017-11-16 14:13:45
Yes, definitely. 
BTC has proven to be an amazing store of value, an astonishing investment, a great place to put SegWit tech, and, thanks to SegWit, a whole orgy of new tech.
BCH doesn't have any promising tech lined up at all. It's biggest claim to fame is "we finally have a difficulty system that works". Graphene is a joke, and without SegWit - which will kill AsicBoost, so it won't be accepted EVER by BCH - there's almost no future for innovation beyond "nOw we'LL Do 32mB BloCKs". 
Newsflash: BTC can increase block size as well. They just want to try other stuff first.

When the price goes up 16x in 2 years, and there's massive infighting, then you are going to have increased tx costs.
2 bucks divided by 16 is only 10 cents or so.
Segwit will probably halve the tx cost or so.

If I were REALLY paying attention, then I'd be a True Scotsman.
"Changing the consensus rules" IS how you increase blocksize. Am I missing something, or did you just say "they want it to be 2x"?
"Changing to 2x" = "Changing consensus rules"
If the "businessmen" tried to change the rules, and people didn't like the rules, no one would agree, we'd have a contentious hard fork, and oh look that's where we are.
Notice how you're putting the core devs on a pedestal. Can't they keep working on Seg 2x? I fail to see what's preventing them from jusT jumping over.

One day, Coinbase might just say "lulz" and download all the BTC, ETH, and LTC onto a single Trezor, memorize the code, bury it somewhere, tell only his loved one where it is, what the SEED is...
... and literally his family gains essentially $30 billion.
If his loved one knows how to Monero it, there's legit no way to track who has the money anymore.
Sure, he goes to jail, and the price tanks, but his family won't have to work, at all, for generations. 
Or, the government finally says 'fuck this crypto shit' and decides to shut the biggest exchanges down (or, more likely, steal all their crypto). 
Boom, everyone's fucked.

I am being very literal when I redpond with "I don't know, it's none of our business, and no one has the right to prevent him from owning his value".

Imagine you had two machines: one that shuffles a deck of cards, and one that de-shuffled it back.
If you put a deck of cards diamonds first into the shuffle machine, it will spit them out in some crazy random way. If you then take those cards and kept them in the weird order, and put them in the deshuffle machine, you'd get the deck back diamonds first.
What you're doing is, after shuffling the deck, you're adding more cards to the shuffled deck, and then deshuffling them. When you deshuffle it, you're getting a different deck than when you started.
The wallet won't allow that.
The deck is your private key.
The "shuffle machine" is a "hashing algorithm".
The shuffled deck is your "seed phrase words".
The deshuffle machine doesn't exist yet (thankfully).
Your added words are you bastardizing your private keys.

That video was AA talking about the BCH fork... BCH is essentially dead (I know it's not, but no one's actually using it).
BTC can fork all it wants, people will use the private, anonymous, secure, giant-hash-rate-having fork over the "let's create blacklists" fork all the time.
Hell, BTC forks about twice a week because the same block is discovered simultaneously by different miners.
Why would anyone use "BTC-where-other-people-control-your-money-and-only-have-a-few-thousand-miners" Fork over "BTC-No-One-Knows-Who-You-Are-Or-Who-You're-Paying-and-we-have-thousands-of-terra-hashes-per-second" Fork?

There's still a circle, you're just ignoring it.
People buy BTC with cash -&gt; cash goes to whomever accepts it, and BTC goes to whomever accepts it
BTC is then used to pay for X -&gt; BTC goes to whomever accepts it, and cash goes to whomever accepts it.
That's a circle.
This is an increase in "people who will accept BTC" because now they have a new way to use BitPay for whatever reason.
I know it's not "everyone uses BTC for everything right away", but it's a small step forward.

Thanks for actually responding with your very "objective" definitions that are unbiased in every way.
Your definition of the Left Wing:


Doesn't include the modern American / European Left. The modern Left wants to throw people in jail for making Youtube videos, not baking cakes for people they don't like, and if you call a man a "he" you might be fined.
The modern left wants government to control speech, property, and expression.
***The modern left is Right-Wing by YOUR definition.***
Your definition of Right-Wing: 


Encompasses your definition of the Left-Wing:


The most "powerful" people you can "give power to" is the government.
So, when the Left-Wing uses "the collaborative power of government to keep costs of living down, encourag[es] the spread of ideas and (increasingly) protect[...] the environment", they're "giving power to the powerful".
***You've literally defined the Left-Wing and the Right-Wing as the same thing***
This is why I use the definition I used: "The left wishes to hold the community as more important than the individual, and the right wishes to hold the individual as more important than the community".
This is also why I love bitcoin: I'm on the right (by MY definition, not yours) and love individuals.

Then how do you reconcile the "widely accepted definitions" of these terms with the fact that "the Philosopher of Fascism", Giovannti Gentile, basically just took Marxism and threw in Nationalism?
Fascism was literally "National Communism / Socialism".
How could two nearly identical ideas be so far apart on the spectrum? This is a GLARING flaw in the definition of these terms.
Furthermore, how can "left-wing" be 


... when the state is the most privileged group of people in the country? They literally control the military and power of taxation.
The state IS an inequality, per se. People who belong to the class of "the State" can do things that others can't.

I'm *pretty* sure that if you had your BTC in Trezor BEFORE SegWit launched, then it's still in a non-SegWit address.
I think you'll have to transfer it to a SegWit address.
All SegWit addresses start with a 3, so make sure there's no malware on your system and fire up the ol' ledger to double check the first number - if it's a 1, it's non-SegWit. If it's a 3, you're good.

For fuck's sake, I'll just give you the working definition I'm using.
If you're too lazy to provide me with YOUR working definition, then you're PROBABLY not worth talking to, but here goes:
I define the left as "wanting government control and power to solve problems" and the right as "wanting to keep things at an individual level".
Another way of framing it is "the left wants to give power to a centralized group to care for the needy" and "the right wants power decentralized, making caring for the needy an individual responsibility".
A simpler way of saying it "the left wants authority" and "the right wants individualism".
This is why the left is non-stop harping on "white, cis-gender, hetero-normativity" and all that LGBTQARRP2... whatever it all is; while the Right is saying "clean your room before you bother to try to help your neighbor".
The left is non-stop putting people into groups and trying to decide how disadvantaged they are, while the right is largely saying "shut up and fix yourself - don't rely on other people".

My understanding is that:
1) You want to create a world wide, non-fake-able ledger
2) In order to do that, you need to have lots of computers working non-stop recording the transactions / info, and they all need to be double checking each other in some fashion
3) You can only really convince people to invest in the electricity if you create a "Scarce Digital Product" ("Scarce" and "digital" used to be oxymorons), and engineer this SDP to have qualities that people would want.

It sounds like it would increase the number of miner-friendly txos because people would be encouraged to make more txos if only 2 of them got 'taxed'.
I'd be more likely to pay in BTC foR a night of drinking if I only had to pay for 2 txos. If I had to pay for each beer I bought, I'd probbly just bring fiat.

Honestly people who are so stuck on gold &amp; silver have simply misunderstood what 'the gold standard" generally means.
Of course "the gold standard" literally means "all money is backed by physical gold in a given ratio" (or something like that)...
... but really it means "whatever type of money the free market chooses". All the Austrian Economists - hardcore gold-bugs - agree with this statement. If you listen to any lecture about gold or money off of mises.org, they all start off with "the gold standard means 'whatever the market wants'."
Thus, Bitcoin IS "the gold standard". After all, nothing has intrinsic value, not even gold. Value is entirely in the eye of the beholder. 
Expect the new "gold standard" to be cryptocurrencies.

Governments, indeed, cannot be trusted to control the money supply.
After the US experienced hyper-inflation, the Constitution was written. And, in that fancy document, the ability to control money was STRIPPED of the federal government.
Unfortunately, Congress found a work around path via banks.
Obviously banks love the ability to give their friends free money, and the government loves being their friend.
Banks can't be trusted, nor can governments.
I'm very thankful to be alive during the formative years of bitcoin technology.
For those who doubt the claim about the Constitution, here are the quotes:


Notice the verb; COIN money. The ability to print money already existed. The verb COIN was very important.
This, mixed with the 10th amendment (the best amendment)...


... makes clear that money can not be printed or digitized by Congress -- which, at that time, was the major government branch.

If you print a shit ton of money, give it to the government and banks, then they get to spend the money before the average citizen is even aware it exists.
As the new money works its way through the economy, prices creep up. The average citizen gets the money after prices hace gone up.
Thus, their purchasing power has been reduced -- they've been robbed through inflation.
Going further, if you're retired, or you're not working, you literally get NO benefits, but eat the penalties.
Plus, in order to actually beat inflation, people have to invest in ventures they don't understand -- i.e. the stock market.
This is, like, THE reason Bitcoin was made.

So, in Venezuela, things were going really well for a long time.
Then some moron gained political power and decided "hey, let's try out this stupid socialist thing!".
The country got so poor that they couldn't even ship out the massive amounts of crude oil they had in reserve because no one was keeping their ships in working order.
Read that again: They were so poor, that they couldn't even sell the one thing that the entire world economy is waging wars over.
So, anyway, in this leader's idiotic benevolence, he made one policy that helped everyone: if you were a necessary factory, you would get free electricity.
People living near those factories were lucky enough to also get free electricity, and so they started mining bitcoin.
With the bitcoin they mined, they sold it to people in the US for care packages of food, clothing, and medicine.
They survived thanks to Bitcoin while everyone around them was looking for another dog to eat.
When I heard about this from a few sources, I plunged into Bitcoin.
In other countries, where the money just got horribly debased and inflated, people are likely still alive because they had a loved one buy bitcoin, keep their savings' value in tact, and then use the money to pay for bills etc. Andreas Antonopoulos tells a story about how he foresaw the debasing of the Greek currency, and begged his mom to buy Bitcoin.

I never said anything had intrinsic value. You're putting that accusation on me out of nowhere.
NOTHING has intrinsic value. To claim otherwise is to say that "shit and carcasses are equally valuable as steak -- after all, flies like them equally". This is clearly nonsense.
Value can't be both intrinsic AND subjective. You need to double check your doublethink.
Gold is just a shiny metal whose chemical properties happened to suit it well to the need for money.
That's it. You should reread that sentence a few times.
It was nothing more than "the thing that best suited our needs for exchanges of value, accounting of value, and store of value". 
That's it.
That being said, now paper shit-money can do the same thing. It IS doing the same thing.
To claim otherwise is to completely ignore modern society. 
You're either willfully ignoring reality, or you're mixing up intrinsic value and subjective value.

We can create what we need out of money.

No prob, bob. I'm a bit surprised that so few people have very much knowledge of Bitcion here, but anyone trying to learn is a hero!
This graph is one guy's node's mempool. 
A node is a single "block chain self-verifier", that is, you hook up a computer and it runs a program that LITERALLY goes through EVERY transaction since the Genesis Block and verifies that the money being spent by an address ACTUALLY has the money that it claims it has.
So, when you spend some bitcoin, it "broadcasts" the message to everyone with a node "I want to give Jimmy 1 btc at 3:10:02pm Jan 3rd 2018" (or whatever), and the nodes verify that, at that time, you have 1btc. However, the nodes hold the transaction info, and the miners then take the info and put it into a block.
When they can't fit all the transactions into the block, there's a leftover "memory pool" of broadcast transactions that, hopefully, will go through in the next block.
The chart shows how many transactions are left in this guy's node's mempool, and how much the fees each transaction is paying to the miners.
TL;DR: you want to send your money when the chart's Y axis is low.

The problem with this is that you don't know when youre actually at the ATH.
It might go up 500 and only drop 400. If you sold now, and you hoped it would hit 6( in a dip, you'd be fucked.
When it shot to 5800, it never fell below 5200, which was still 400 over the previous steady position.
Then, in the span of 1 hour -- 1 HOUR -- it shot up to 6k
There was no way to see any of that, and people who were waiting for 5200 just lost a few coins.

When there's deflation, you can't "make money" by hoarding. That's like, the opposite of what's happening. Your purchasing power / wealth increases.
That's a good thing. If you make money saving... That's whatzs supposed to happen. People don't risk their money on ventures unless they have confidence in the investment. People aren't shoving their savings into the latest Ponzi Scheme or ICO trying to beat inflation. 
If deflation happens at a NATURAL rate, there's no problem.

Have you seen the charts? BTC has more Than octupled since July last year.
Of course transaction fees have skyrocketed. If you put half your wage in BTC last year, at $30/month you'd have somewhere near $800 by now (sloppy math) instead of $180.
What's a dollar of tx cost compared to a quadrupling of relative wealth?

No. A company WANTS to raise prices, but they have competition. As companies invest in better machines, more efficient transportation, and all that, they can undercut their competition, stealing market share.

If I spend the btc to a mycelium wallet, how would they know itzs MY Mycellium wallet, and not Sally's?
I know that the blockchain records the transaction, but how does the blockchain know that "The address that was directly ID'd with Me sent 0.01 btc to MY mycellium wallet's address".

No, Jesus united himself with death and destroyed it. This is what makes the Chrsitian narrative special. All the other narratives have the hero venture to Hades to fix, retrieve, or save someone. Jesus unified with it and destroyed it.
Hell was in an uproar because it was done away with.
It was in an uproar because it is mocked.
It was in an uproar, for it is destroyed.
It is in an uproar, for it is annihilated.
It is in an uproar, for it is now made captive.
Hell took a body, and discovered God.
It took earth, and encountered Heaven.
It took what it saw, and was overcome by what it did not see.
O death, where is thy sting?
O Hades, where is thy victory?
Christ is Risen, and you, O death, are annihilated!
Christ is Risen, and the evil ones are cast down!
Christ is Risen, and the angels rejoice!
Christ is Risen, and life is liberated!
Christ is Risen, and the tomb is emptied of its dead; for Christ having risen from the dead, is become 
the first-fruits of those who have fallen asleep.

The things you think are nonsense are some of the most profound things you could ever hear.
You are looking at the bible while wearing the wrong glasses. You can't expect to enjoy the movies wearing sunglasses.
Go check out Jonathan Pageau on youtube, and get his brother's book, The Language of Creation, by Matthieu Pageau.
Here's a teaser: God's name, "I am that I am" is the same sentence as "Thou shalt not lie", and just a reiteration of "thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven".
And God breathing life into the dirt to make Adam? Pretty much the same thing, but with the twist that humanity's job is to mediate the heavens and earth.
It pisses me off that no one told me this when I actually went to bible school. All we did was color pictures of animals and Noah.

What arguments of his do you agree with?
I'm a huge Schiff fan - Laffer still owes him that penny - but every complaint he has against Bitcoin is equally valid against gold/silver.
The only arguments that have any credibility against Bitcoin but that can't be applied to gold (that I can think of) is that Bitcoin is largely pointless (a) if there's a massive electrical problem / internet problem, or (b) until your neighbor is willing / able to accept it.
He never bothers to make these arguments, though. Instead he just insults both Bitcoin AND gold, showing that he doesn't know economics NEARLY as well as anyone at the Mises Institute.

I'm a die-hard libertarian. Ron Paul woke me up in 2006, and I plunged hard into Anarcho-Capitalism the more I looked into Austrian Economics.
That being said, there's no way in hell Donald Trump would have won without Ron Paul's runs.
And as angry as I am to say it, Donald Trump has been the most libertarian president of my life time (he's not even very libertarian - he just 'hasn't started a war').
People who like Trump over lap a lot with people who don't trust government, and there's a HUGE overlap with people who don't trust anything global.
Even weirder is the fact that all the An-Caps at are huge BCH supporters. They're so deep into conspiracy theories that they actually think BTC is controlled by some strange cabal that... apparently has... complete control over all the mining in all the different countries... and are also the programmers...?

Yeah, police storm your house. They don't drop a tomahawk missile on you.
Comparing the force of the military vs. guys with gun entering your house, the 2nd Amendment really helps things out.
Don't conflate "the full force of the military" to "people who have to charge into your house".
One of those is defendable with every-day household objects + guns.

Best option is a cold storage wallet: transfer your btc on an exchange to your cold wallet's address (if you've never done this, learn how and double check everything).

It's intriguing to think that Bitcoin is really just a giant pile of gold under the ocean that we all know is there, but no one can reach, so we just trade keys to if we could reach it.

Honestly, they knew BTC was in a bubble and started selling.
How maby BTC did they sell? I've always viewed them as the harbringer of the bust.

My keys, my Bitcoin. If you want MY bitcoin, then follow the rules I give you. I didn't steal the coins, I earned them. 
I had to convince someone else to give me their bitcoin - their rule was "give me X dollars". My rules are different.

If the expense of mining Bitcoin is the main driver to its price... then Bitcoin is completely worthless.
This has cause and effect backwards. People invested in mining because the price went up. Miners who weren't FOMO-crazy probably didn't invest in new miners in the last half of 2017. It was clearly a bubble - always worry when you see a parabola.


I'm sorry, what? 
If BTC is selling for $10k then it's selling for $10k regardless of how many Bitcoin you're mining. And the cost of mining remains the same no matter the price, and no matter how many Bitcoin you mine.
That is, if I spent a trillion dollars right now on mining equipment... then I've spent a trillion dollars on mining equipment. This has NO effect on the price.
If I spent a trillion dollars on mining equipment, and I earn 30% of every block this year, then ... that doesn't change how many bitcoin are mined in a year because the difficulty rate would adjust. The same number of Bitcoin are mined, and the price is largely unaffected.
This guy is just spewing nonsense.
A price is created ONLY when two individuals get together and agree to exchange X for Y. Nothing else matters. If Mr. A is asking for too much, or Mr. B is only willing to give too little (both statements mean the same thing), then the price is never generated.
Buying hashing equipment doesn't encourage anyone to exchange Bitcoin for dollars.
The only thing that lowered (and raised) the price was "a bunch of people agreed to buy and sell at a price that was either lower or higher than what a different (or the same) bunch of people agreed to buy and sell a few seconds earlier". 
That's it. 
The price went up 20-fold in a year. Of course it was going to crash. I remember posting here that it was going to crash, and everyone told me to fuck off.

Why are we discussing the politics of bitcoin?
The answer is because money is political. Politics is the art of controlling others. Violence, theft, charisma, deception, and money are many of the important parts of politics.
This is why bitcoin is political.
Why was bitcoin created? The obvious answer should fall out of your mouth immediately: it is an attempt to take one of the methods of control out of politics. If money can be entirely taken out of politics, then those seeking power have one less weapon.
I am an anarchist - and anarcho-capitalist for those keeping score - and, as such, I immediately recognize the benefits and dangers of bitcoin for the cause of anarchy.
But this isn't important. What's important is that we ALL -- liberals, conservatives, communists, capitalists, anarchists, statists -- recognize bitcoin for what it is: an attempt to take power away from the power-hungry.
To my fellow anarchists: be wary. Bitcoin isn't a fail safe to keeping money out of the hands of government. Gold should have been such a tool in and of itself, but the hearts of the powerful found a way to control it. Bitcoin can equally be controlled by simply hounding those who wish to accept it. "No, we won't make bitcoin illegal. We'll just make it illegal to SELL bitcoins!"
