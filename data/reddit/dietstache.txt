Mike Hearn calls you out in his article, do you have any response to this? 






As you can imagine, this enraged people.

But it's not like stocks in that bitcoins can be split.  You can own .1 or 0.001 or whatever.  So the stock split doesn't make sense.

That is completely different then how my experience went.  I signed up, linked my bank account, and was able to purchase up to $2500 all within about 10 minutes of signing up.

This was in the past few months.  My friend just opened an account and had the same thing.  They have a referral where the new account has to buy at least $100 of bitcoin.  This wouldn't be possible with a $50 limit now would it?  Hope you get it fixed.

So as long as it's gimmicky and small it's no problem, but what happens if bitcoin were to become more popular? This is something I'm having trouble with in seeing bitcoin being used on a daily basis by your average person.

They have to have the bitcoin arrive into their account before you get the referral.  So if they used a bank account then it will take a few days.  I've had every referral work for me.

I was instantly given $2500 limit with coinbase....I linked with my bank account.

When you reverse a charge on a credit card, the merchant involved can still fight the reverse.  With bitcoin there is no fight, they lose 100% of the time.

Does coinbase really take 3 weeks for your bitcoin to arrive? Mine always take around 5 days or less.

What are people's thoughts on bitcoin price once the stress test occurs?  I assume it would go up if the test didn't disrupt anything and fall if there were major delays.

From my experience it doesn't take 3-5 days using Western Union.  You can go and pick up cash in just a few hours.

I think for your average person buying a few bitcoins, using coinbase or gemini and holding coins with them is a fine way to do it.  You can play around with sending money, I personally like bread wallet for iOS.  
Once you start putting more money in is when I would look at more secure offline storage.

How does increasing block size hurt decentralization?

Where in the past has the price hovered just above $400 or $500 for months at a time, like it has for $200?
@_date: 2015-10-07 21:44:30
It's not a 25 day backlog...and it's only backlogged if you have extremely small fees.  All of my transactions today have gone through without issue.

Can you ELI5?
