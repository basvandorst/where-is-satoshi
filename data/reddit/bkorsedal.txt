Same way they bust people for growing pot, track the spikes in electrical production.  Then the government could stockpile confiscated mining equipment and then fund the whole sting operation by (evil genius pinky to mouth) mining cryptocurrency.  Until they have 51% of the hash rate, then crash the thing.

As a percentage of total transactions for buying goods and services, that actual use case of a currency, how do you think bitcoin compares to the USD?  What percentage of bitcoin transactions are for illegal goods and services compared to percentage of USD transactions that are used for illegal goods and services.  I bet around half of the transactions for bitcoin goods and services are in the illegal sector.  Probably less than 5% for the USD.  Just a rough guess.

The biggest supporters of Bitcoin are the holders .... full stop.
Businesses don't need it.  It's a bad currency.  Fiat is easier and more mainstream.  Businesses built the infrastructure to support bitcoin during the 2013-2018 period might see one or two transactions during that time frame.  Regardless of cost, it's not worth the added complexity to support bitcoin.  There is simply not enough demand.  
You just want them to join your ecosystem so your magic internet beans will moon.  You have no concern for their needs.  Bitcoin will not go mainstream because there is no demand for it.  Make a compelling reason for the business to switch to bitcoin and maybe they will do it.  Don't just pout at them because they won't give you free money for doing nothing.

@_date: 2018-06-18 12:27:02
A PoW currency can never become a global currency.  Here is why:
Global GDP, meaning the total flow around the world for an entire year is $78.28 trillion.  There are 365 days in a year.  That means that global currencies transactions are about $214.5 billion a day.  There are approximately 1800 blocks a day.  Therefore an average block of transactions would have a value of about $119 million.
That's how much someone can gain per block for a 51% attack.  
How much electricity do you need to burn per block to make it difficult / impossible to crash the world economy.  2 x $119 million would do it, but that's way too high.  You are burning more electricity than you are transacting in value.  Let's just say you have to burn $50 million of electricity.  
$50 million * 1800 * 365 = $32.85 trillion dollars.
A megawatt hour is about $150. So, 219 e9 megawatt hours.  1 Terrawatt = 1e6 megawatts.  So 219,000 Terrawatts hours per year to make the blockchain secure.   
The world currenty uses 157,481 TWh.  So somehow you guys are going to use 1.4x the current global power supply just to run a currency?  
Now, before any of you brainacs chime in, if there is an energy breakthrough and the price of power drops dramatically then you only have to burn more power.  You need to burn $32 trillion dollars of resources.  So if those resources get cheaper, you just need to waste more.
If you don't waste enough resources, someone will just spool up a bunch of cloud servers and hack the global currency.

Bitcoin is a ecological disaster as far as energy used per transaction.  It can exist at the hobbiest level or darknet level, but it will never go mainstream.  Unfortunately, this bubble has put it beyond it's limits.  When the bubble pops and the coin price sinks, there will be a lot of stranded mining assets with no way to profit from them apart from doing a 51% attack.  Other currencies try to address this but they all fail.  Insane waste was traded for trust.  It's the Achilles heel of all crypto.  Without trust, you must burn insane amounts of resources per transaction in order to make it unprofitable to hijack the blockchain and centralized systems that depend on trust will always have the upper hand.
Right now bitcoin is increasing the coin supply by 5.1% annually.  This is far more than the fiat money supply is being increased, and there is no way to decrease the coin printing.  If you try, then either the fees will skyrocket or the blockchain will be hijacked by a 51% attack.  
Crypto's don't scale well.  They are an engineering dead end.  
So buy it if you want a hobby currency with no future.  But don't expect it to moon.  It's already beyond the limits of proof of work.
@_date: 2018-06-18 13:49:09
Off chain transactions are irrelevant.  It's a matter of how much power / resources need to be wasted in order to make a 51% attack unprofitable.  It's solely related to the value of the transactions in the block and the value of the resources to be wasted.
@_date: 2018-06-19 10:27:55
I would love for a distributed, currency of the people to work.  However, all the PoW currencies are going to be an ecological disaster.  Most of the crypto space is either a simplification of the real problems that exist in the global financial systems or outright scams and bullshit.  I would love for there to be something better than what we have, but I don't think it's been invented yet.
I think fiat will crash soonish.  I don't know when.  It's lasted longer than I thought so I'm not calling it.  I don't see how our current economic system can survive mass automation.  I think driverless cars will crash the economy.  Google is finally getting some traction with real driverless taxies, so we are getting there.  The U.S. is in debt and they are just going to go deeper in debt until there is some sort of crash.
I think gold will be a good store of value through upcoming chaos.  Maybe reinvest money after whatever upcoming chaos happens.  Gold will be a good place to store value until there is space mining. 
@_date: 2018-06-15 08:22:41
Not a huge blow yet.  It will take a while for that to work through the system.  Things change slow.  I think the way the U.S. wields the USD as a weapon of financial warfare has more people interested in dumping the dollar than the Yuan backed oil.  Trump is also disassembling the whole world order and I think he's going for a more isolationist USA, for better or worse.  I like the idea of an isolationist USA, but I'm not a political / economic expert.
A lot of countries are stockpiling gold and recalling their gold reserves from the USA.

Each time you trade, if it's been less than a year, you take a huge tax hit on your gains.  Assuming you have a 50% chance of timing the market correctly, you'll be at a statistical disadvantage because of the tax implications.  It's like the house advantage in blackjack or roulette.  Unless you have insider information, you aren't going to get a better than 50% chance of making the right call.  So in the long run, you are screwing yourself.  Unless you are a scammer or market mover.  The guys running the pump/dump and running the scams are the one reliably making the money.  Everyone else is just playing a rigged lotto.

Ronpaulfan69 said it best, so I'm quoting him below.
"The 5.1% increase of bitcoin represents an increase in the total supply.
The Fed's inflation goal of 3% represents the increase in the price of goods and services included in the CPI, as denominated in USD.
They're two different things.
The best comparison to the 5.1% bitcoin increase, is probably the M2, which went from $13.37 trillion to $13.9 trillion over the last 12 months, which is about a 3.9% increase, so less than the percentage increase in bitcoin.

Miners sell 54,000 coins a month.  Mt. Gox lawyer plans on selling 160k coins before September (about 30k per month).  A lot of bitcoin gamblers have huge tax bills.  Many owe more in taxes than they have in crypto holdings.  So there is a lot of coins being sold.  
In order to pump the price up, you need to have a matching buy enthusiasm.  Look at the search history charts for crypto.  The popularity is way, way down.  No normies are buying into it.  
The tether scam did a good job of pumping up the price with fake USDT, but that can only do so much, especially since they have been suppenoed by the US Gov.

If I'm right, then I save my investment.  I'm not buying coins.  The time to buy was before this big spike or after the dust has settled.  Not now.  But I think this will be the end of bitcoin.  I don't think it will go mainstream.  I don't believe in the U.S. dollar either.  I put my money in gold.  It's the only thing that hasn't had a big jump up in price, so sooner or later it will spike up.  No rush.  I'll probably leave it in gold until people are almost mining asteroids, then convert it to stocks or something.  It just seems like everything in the market is over valued at the present moment.

The next halving will reduce bitcoins inflationary trajectory down to half.  However, I think sooner or later you'll have problems funding your transactions.  Those coins go to fund the transactions.  Bitcoin transactions actually cost way more than transactions done by Visa or Mastercard, except you only end up paying a small fraction of the total cost.  About 1% right now.  As the power usage increases and the subsidizing of the transactions halves, you'll eventually hit a point where it's not economical.

@_date: 2018-04-03 13:37:47
But capital inflows an outflows are not something the central bank / developers impose on the currency.  The Fed prints money.  Miners mine coins.  It's a similar dynamic.  Surprisingly, miners are presently inflating the coin supply by 5.1% this year and that's larger than the Fed's target inflation rate.  So, relatively speaking, the central authority (developers for bitcoin or central bank for dollars) for bitcoin is more inflationary than the Fed right now.
@_date: 2018-04-03 13:41:11

So you are telling me that if there were only 1,000,000 coins in circulation and miners, mined an then sold 1,000,000 coins in a one year period, the price of bitcoin would remain fixed.  As the money supply in trading went from 1M coins to 2M coins.  All other things being held constant for this thought experiment.  What if they mined and dumped 100 trillion coins on the market.  Would a bitcoin remain the same price because those coins were priced in from the beginning?
