Anyone that disagrees with this, I would love to take you around the US and show you the many gas stations in my area alone that give you a price discount for paying in cash.  Those merchant fees are obviously something they are trying to avoid.

I'd say yes and no.  Yes, it seems sluggish, but at the same time, a watched pot never boils.  I agree with OP in the sense that we are somewhat losing perspective on the breakneck speed that bitcoin is taking off just because we've all been watching it so closely.  Take a step back, look at the timeline, and it is a marvel to behold.
Edit:  A word.

No fees for Western Union?  I am having difficulty believing this.

Just because you're an asshole doesn't mean I hate all French people.  You are remarkably small-minded.

Well, way to give them ideas!

Indeed he did.  Obviously, we all would rather have seen any number of spokepersons that are knowledgeable about Bitcoin up there talking to the CNN audience...but hey, at the end of the day, I am still a little jazzed about Bitcoin getting featured on CNN at all.  More exposure, more betterer.

I will disagree with you.  Prostate cancer is horrible, and Movember is great.  But ALS affects so few people that there is little chance of pharmaceutical companies spending R&amp;D money on it, as there will be little chance of recouping their costs.  This makes raising awareness and funds very important.  As far as the methodology of dousing yourself with ice water?  Maybe they could come up with something better, but I appreciate the intentions.

True, but even as crypto-currencies go mainstream, competitors of bitcoin will not have the credibility that bitcoin will have established, IMO.  In time, another blockchain technology may take BTC's place, but by then bitcoin will have increased exponentially in value.  I think the comparison with AOL seems appropriate.  Even though AOL eventually lost relevance, it would have been pretty sweet to be an early investor in that.

Now that sounds like the comment I would have responded with, of I were better at stuff.
Seriously Bitpay, let's get down to embracing the obvious.  Ben Lawsky will never, ever, ever stand up to Wall Street when they call his office and make suggestions for how to destroy bitcoin.  There are a lot of people in New York that are killing it under the current system, so I wouldn't be at all surprised that they would fight any innovation that could one day derail the gravy train they are on.  Also, the pro-bitcoin voice is relatively quiet in this country, so they won't even be running into significant PR issues for strangling bitcoin in its proverbial crib.
These facts will not change with any amount of diplomacy from the good folks at Bitpay, so why bother to engage?  As long as the current paradigm stands, the only real choice for bitcoin enterprises is to do business in the other 49 states until enough momentum exists behind bitcoin to have a winnable fight with the Lawsky crew.

Hang in there.  You will still make money.

That is just highly unlike Western Union.  Anytime I have sent money with them, they have raped me hard.  I'm not doubting you, but I'm surprised that you were surprised that I was surprised.

Because of the...implications.

When the World Wide Web was first launched, I wonder if there were legislators crying over how easy it would now be for criminals to talk to each other across the globe without the potential for wiretaps.

Better practice being able to suck that thing out and swallow it with your last ounce of post-heart attack strength...those paramedics have sticky fingers.

Now you have hit what I find to be a more troubling question that I have not seen adequately addressed.  As people understand bitcoin better, those that have any disposable income and an eye on the market are encouraged to hold on to their coins and spend their fiat.  I personally spend a portion of my coins simply because I want to expand bitcoin and help it become a viable currency...but if we are to rely on altruism to make bitcoin take off, we may be in trouble.  
This is just my thoughts.  Should anyone be able to answer that, I would genuinely appreciate it.
@_date: 2014-07-01 09:09:44
Please expand on that for me.

Well, I didn't promise *you* anything!
I'm just kidding.  Feel free to be mad at me as well.  
@_date: 2015-03-19 01:27:22
Well, maybe not optimal, but as long as you hold BTC, eventually  you won't be kicking yourself.  At least that's what we are all hoping.  But feel free to be mad at me in four years if you still regret buying in at $700.

I love the way you said that.  "Being human is dumb sometimes."  I hope you don't mind if I use that.
