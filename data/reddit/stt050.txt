URGENT! I have the same issue. Kraken support is not resolving for the past 3 months! I haven't got a single human response from them so far. I received an email requesting documentation, which I provided (several times that is). I have &gt; $5,000 in funds under my account, which are STUCK and not able to use them.

Problem is their fallback procedure (for missing Master Key) ending up useless as they never get to respond after I provide account verification data (the latter I sent multiple times as response to their support ticket).

 Please make sure ticket 1246513 is responded to ASAP. I will not tolerate any further delay.

 You are exactly correct as per the 4 tickets I opened. My problem is after creating a ticket (let's stick to my latest 1246513) I receive an email from support with (ACTION REQUIRED) and 7 security questions. I respond to all questions in an email back to support but I never get any response or resolution. Now, should I alternatively submit the response via the ticket system? If yes, how can I do it given I am not able to log into my account (the ticket support system requires login). Else, what is the reason noone is responding to the email I send, as I provide all the information required? Please let me know ASAP as I need access to the funds urgently.

Right. Forgot to mention I actually never stored the Maser Key. I've been much more careful ever since storing Master keys for the other crypto accounts I have. Would certainly store it for Kraken this time as long as they let me reset the 2FA.

My latest ticket number with Kraken support is 1246513. Please resolve this ASAP.

 Kraken need to resolve this ASAP. Having funds in an exchange not accessible is CRAZY. This is an exchange that feeds the BTC futures price at CME. Their degree of unresponsiveness has been nothing short of insane. I am expecting their resolution. If not soon, I will be making a complaint to Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other relevant agencies. Kraken need to act on ticket 1246513 ASAP!
