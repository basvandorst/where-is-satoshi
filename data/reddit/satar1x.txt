You have to buy a new printer, print the paper wallet and then destroy the printer, at least that was what I did
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:13:12
Do you know why that happens?

We cant expect cryptos to be the new thing if 2 persons can manipulate the market like that, Its known that on new year the price dips, probably a lot of ppl selling for christmas, remember that the price increased from 8000 to 19500 in like 10 days, its had to be a dip soon, I still expect it to go up again after new year
sorry bad english

I have same specs, Im currently mining about 35 bitcoins per week, but thats because I have all overclock to 741.0GHz
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:22:00
you can cancel it while its in pending?
@_date: 2017-12-02 12:42:11
Do you remember what was the fee? and what wallet did you used? If im now wrong, some wallet let you chose whatever fee you want, and if its very very very very low fee its going to take a lot of time or even never arrive.
Correct me if wrong

he forgot the pin, you cant blame the hardware wallet

Im from Uruguay, on coinmama I can buy 1 btc for $11,100 and on cex its cost $11,800
11100 is that bad considering that a btc is 10,500 aprox?
I think if they take another day to verify my profile im going to end up buying face to face with someone.
 thanks

can you explain me how can they fail? I save my bitcoins on my ledger, and I have tested the 24 word seed before, can i get fuck'd somehow?
@_date: 2017-11-28 09:42:49
Thanks you, I just bought a ledger from amazon, its take like 15 days to arrive to my country, If I decide to buy bitcoins today, can I save it on my electrum offline wallet, and when I receive the ledger I have to send the bitcoins to the new adress on the ledger? Or just with the seed of my electrum into the ledger?
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:02:24
why the recover seed doesn't work? try the seed on another wallet
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:42:43
what other site can I use? Im kinda limited because of my country :/ 
@_date: 2017-11-28 09:20:15
so If I download electrum on a new pc, disable internet, make a new wallet on my pendrive, save the seed on a paper,  remove the pendrive, make another copy on another pendrive, delete all the files on the pc, and then with the adress move some bitcoins to my wallet on the pendrive, im basically safe?
Also, I tried to extend my seed with custom words, but when I try to recover the wallet with that seed, they dont ask for the extra words, just with the 12 I can access to the wallet.

thanks you!
