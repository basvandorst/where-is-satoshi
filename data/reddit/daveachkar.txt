Definitely the worst time to be posting this...

I agree, and often have the same reaction.
People are not able to distinguish between a technology's intrinsic flaws vs growing pains.
Convenience, volatility, etc. are all problems that can be solved over time i.e., growing pains.

Thanks Bruce! It was great to be part of it!

Love to hear about your enthusiasm! I'll be launching one in Lebanon soon. You should also check the recently launched meetup in Jordan 
Why not try to kick things off yourself? Do you know of a small community of Bitcoin enthusiast in Dubai?
Send me a message if you'd like to chat more about this.

Yes I think it's a matter of time.
Here's one coming up soon:

And turns out, there already exists one:
@_date: 2014-02-10 12:56:31
what place?
@_date: 2014-10-27 19:19:06
Requested an invite as well.
Out of curiosity, why is the group closed? Why not keep it open to everyone?

I think things will change soon, Bitcoin companies are starting to pop up in the region, making it more accessible.
For example, we're working on  and  others are working on   and more.
Even with this, we need many more players - let's have everyone here start something :)

Yep, you're right. It was a short segment with lots of misinformation and inaccuracies. 
We're hoping to create a better source of information on Bitcoin in the region (by localizing content, etc.)
@_date: 2014-12-21 09:09:35
Great! Other question: how do you handle accidental clicks?
@_date: 2014-11-03 20:16:30
And we're all about feedback - share generously!

It's only a matter of time until services that do offer such security and convenience are developed on top of bitcoin.
Your sentence should read: "This is why bitcoin will NOT become mainstream as a currency TODAY", who knows about tomorrow.

Yes, Igot sponsored the event and they had their regional manager attending.
@_date: 2015-03-31 17:29:30
Definitely! I completely agree. Let's talk. We already started working on [Shubitcoin]( (and the [arabic version]( and are excited to get many more educational/informational resources in the region.

I was in the same position (withdrawing to USD). I  just cancelled my withdrawal, and will be buying bitcoins instead.
I'm confident that the price of BTC will go up, so even though you'd be buying "at a loss" today, in a few weeks you'll likely break even.
That is if you can wait - but assuming you waited 2 months, an additional 2 won't hurt...

I wouldn't use the word "guinea pig". Made me freak out about being scammed
