I can definitely see the money flow increase since 4pm MST US almost double in some platforms

Still static 1.5 hours later

Liq. Ratio is flipped now so price remains static
@_date: 2019-07-28 23:38:36
Dip, Margin crash, altcoin shakedown, Dump n pump, it’s all the same. You can see the oh shit alarm on the liq. Ratio
@_date: 2019-07-28 23:43:10
Theirs a lot of people asking now, so it’s a good time to sell.

Still static, good time to sell

True, I thought this looks like a margin trading strategy. Anything to make a buck. In order to stay on top lists the volume has to remain at a certain level in competition with Bitcoin volumes to remain prominent on liquidation exchange lists.

I’m into Sci-Fi so naturally I gravitate to stuff like this
@_date: 2019-08-20 01:23:58
Yes, you can find stories like this in the Bi-Fi section at Barnes and Nobles and all over bsv prop.

Thanks, I think that ether is gone. The lag is like dial up. Too slow for this day and age.

Yeah, middle of one week I bought btc  then watched it go to 9.4, then to 11.4 before the coin was final bought by them and placed into my wallet later the next week. I was forced to HODL. They could of bought it cheap and sold to me for more or vice versus which is bad for them. Either way it’s horrible business practice, they and their parent company ( Overstock.com ) have been losing money since Q1’18

It works if your patient but you can’t cash out if you didnt buy the coin from them. If your transfer out and back it that it no longer liquid through them.

I feel they would own the low priced etc before they put Bitcoin so they gain 5% on the exchange. When the etc is at the high they declare enough gain, and they exchange back into Bitcoin at the float amount it maintains. They end up with more Bitcoin.
