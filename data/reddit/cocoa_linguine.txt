Don’t ask Bob Lutz about Tesla.

My car is leased. My savings was in that bitcoin. Whatever I have left will be used for survival.  I don’t have the luxury of investing at this point. I’m a statistic with a hardened heart. Yes it’s my fault but I feel victimized and what’s the point anymore.

Agreed. It’s a long shot but one I will always consider...

I thank you for sharing this. Genuinely. Success or not, it is constructive and I appreciate it.

I rent. My auto insurance doesn’t cover contents of trunk. Went down that road.  Even tried building owners insurance. Exhausted those options.

Of course not because I’m a fucking idiot. Instead of using my atm pin I probably choose one 9 digits long thinking it would be added protection.

Thanks. He replied no can do.

Thank you. A much kinder response than what I’m getting over at r/buttcoin 
One poster is even accusing me of being the thief and hypothesizing that I’m trying to crack a stolen wallet. 
I shared my story. I’ll be leaving now.

How is it possible to transfer without entering a pin first though?

Literally just read that and sent a message to the author on Twitter.

No. Audi. But they did use a key fob spoofer.

When the robbery happened, I spent the following days checking garbage cans and combing the neighborhood. I really really did. The notebook definitely had my name and phone number. Robbery happened in early April.

Is that the theory where you hit me in the head with a $5 hammer and all my pain and worry goes away?

Negative. Just auto. Another life lesson.
