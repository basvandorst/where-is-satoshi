i'm struggling with this as well. i could dollar cost average a deposit every day/week/whatever but it's hard to justify buying in at the moment due to my average buy price.

yes, this is why I opened the coinbase account. i'm hesitant to sell on RH in the event that i can never buy in that low again, but i don't like that i don't actually own any btc

how long have you been doing this? how has your return been? i understand many users don't focus on returns but i'm just curious.

from what little i know, RH doesn't actually have any btc but you can still trade it at market value. so if you play with btc like a regular stock, it works fine. but if you want to actually own btc like it was made for, then go with coinbase (pro).

Bought in on robinhood (only $250 worth) at $5.6k but recently opened a coinbase pro account. I've made 100% return but debating selling if we hit 12k and reinvesting on coinbase at the next dip.
