I wonder what that was in 1800?
@_date: 2019-07-26 04:19:06
Yeah I’ve been under audit for literally a year+ now thanks to bitcoin gains in 2017 ://///
Because of my status as a worker on a nascar team then returning to school and paying for school out of pocket I got a bunch of tax credits thanks to education. 
So my return was $3700+ 
But I only asked for 3100 back assuming I could use that extra cash for 2018 
Whelp that strategy didn’t work because I still haven’t gotten my money
Just letters in the mail asking me to cooperate to a jank investigation

The IRS owes me my return still
@_date: 2019-07-26 22:44:02
Literally who the fuck knows
I’ve been in IRS purgatory since I filed my 2017 taxes in June of 2018
They assessed it and put it up for a review in August of 2018
Now it’s audit
I get letters saying I have the right to get lawful defense and the right to an attorney if I wish to follow their investigation 
Now it’s been moved to a caseworker and specialist 
I worked at a single job, had my taxes taken out automatically, and even allowed them to keep $509 additional dollars presuming my capital gains tax o would accrue in 2018 filing
@_date: 2019-07-26 21:46:32
Ahhhhh makes sense
Been under audit for MONTHS actually it’s approaching a who year of audit
And it supposed to end -for the 5th time- in August

I bought at 
600 
Then kinda forgot about it and bought more at 6,000
Sold at 17,000 seeing there was a major drop coming
Bought back in at 9

I can attest to this story
I’m one of them
I’m about to lose my entire return and even face prosecution
Been under audit for almost a year 
Very sad for me
I didn’t even sell my bitcoin in 2017 
I held out under it dropped to 16.5 in early 2018

Thanks :)
@_date: 2019-07-31 16:05:26
I really appreciate your input
I’m very much interested in working/interning with a professional before I jump into it! I have a few other personal plans for my life
Hoping I can make money from it :)
@_date: 2019-07-15 02:40:37
Honestly I am not even gonna look 
Only invest if you have it dipshits lol
@_date: 2019-08-06 11:26:46
I literally can’t even go to work before you pussies jump out of the market! 
I wasn’t gonna sell but damnit I just wanted to see some gains :/

Remember that Dogecoin NASCAR?
@_date: 2019-08-01 20:47:35
Guess I’ll be living large when the economy collapses next year
@_date: 2019-08-24 19:10:14
It’s ducking beautiful
@_date: 2019-08-06 11:50:53
Lol that’s probably true hahahaha
@_date: 2019-08-01 19:13:15
The s should be a little more wavy 
But objectively it’s a good logo
What is it gonna be used for?
@_date: 2019-08-01 20:57:32
Man you know I’m thinking an island we can more or less self sustain 
Tristan de cuna is overpriced for what we want
Guam is too needy even if we could afford it
St Helena is out of our wheelhouse 
Idk man I’m hoping island but city will probably be easier to get
@_date: 2019-08-02 00:28:22
Agreed!! Glad someone mentioned racing
@_date: 2019-08-01 03:45:30
Yeah one days worth of evidence points me to continue on my current paths to success
I missed Bitmining opportunity back in the year 2016 but at that time I was a nascar crewman and not thinking about life lol. I found out about bitcoin when a nascar team got sponsored by dogecoin lol 
Plus being in libertarian circles I always heard of it but never dove in until like 2016
@_date: 2019-08-24 16:18:19
Let’s go fuck bitches and disregard fiat
@_date: 2019-08-06 11:51:09
Honestly forgot about that possibility entirely
@_date: 2019-09-24 21:56:08
If only bitcoin had violent regimes dump money into the pool to artificially inflate their numbers
