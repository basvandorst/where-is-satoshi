No, because it's the largest. When another crypto takes over the  it's possible this will change
@_date: 2018-01-11 07:53:19
And Bitcoin Core
@_date: 2018-01-06 08:09:20
Man, that's really not very many at all.
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:50:20
You can make a new Binance account, yes.
@_date: 2018-01-06 08:29:25
So Bitcoin is more secure than for example Ether?
@_date: 2018-01-13 17:15:36
Isn't the 4th one also partially wrong? I remember when there were rumors Vitalik had died in a car accident and the price dropped significantly.     
If the LN lead developers get shot, I'm guaranteeing that the price will drop.
@_date: 2018-01-08 22:39:49
Sure, remind me in may if BTC is at 4k.
@_date: 2018-01-08 22:38:02


The 5% is probably a bit low, if you only include people who have money to spend.       
But I couldn't help but notice you just said that 20% of people who've ever heard of crypto have invested in it? I'm sure this number is closer to 0.01%.
@_date: 2018-01-03 08:44:06
Can't wait for it to do that again.     
I'll be waiting. For a long time probably.

@_date: 2018-01-03 08:41:27
So you're saying *all* alt are scams? Lol
@_date: 2018-01-04 14:33:08
You didn't answer me, though. My comment was unrelated to you saying you were joking
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:27:00
They're not, most of these fees have nothing to do with Coinbase.
@_date: 2018-01-20 13:49:21
This is not really advisable as Bitcoin will likely have higher fees than regular exchanges, for now.
@_date: 2018-01-01 00:55:38
Yet Bitcoin still uses more power than Ireland
@_date: 2018-01-01 00:34:49


This would then also increase the price for electricity for the average consumer though. That's my concern.
@_date: 2018-01-06 08:10:48
So, what benefits does Bitcoin have over faster and cheaper CC's when it comes to being a currency? 
@_date: 2018-01-04 22:49:48
BCH was supported for a bit in mid-late December. Then CB decided "the European market isn't ready" and they shut it down for the rest of the month.
@_date: 2018-01-21 08:19:20
A massive crash gets more attention, more clicks, more views.
@_date: 2018-01-20 21:15:25
If your goal is to completely and entirely get rid of fiat, yeah.    
But that's very far away, most likely. I don't see that happening any time soon.
@_date: 2018-01-04 13:56:30
I'm not the guy you asked, but I did.    
The problem is, it's not guaranteed this will be widely used, unlike some of the things other CC's have that give them high speeds/low fees.
@_date: 2018-01-01 08:49:49
@_date: 2018-01-01 00:32:25
The power consumption will go up if more rigs start mining though, and if Bitcoin's value goes up, more rigs will be set up, drawing more power.
@_date: 2018-01-04 22:47:45
`=GOOGLEFINANCE()` in Google Sheets supports it too.     
Eg: `=GOOGLEFINANCE("BTCUSD")`
@_date: 2018-01-04 22:42:32
@_date: 2018-01-20 08:54:09
Fair enough. I'll look into it, thanks.
@_date: 2018-01-24 20:36:08
That... Seems somewhat dangerous.
@_date: 2018-01-01 00:39:29
Really? What a great response.
@_date: 2018-01-06 08:25:59
       
Newegg stopped supporting Bitcoin as a payment method. They seem to only accept Bitcoin Cash now. Likely due to the massive transaction fees.
@_date: 2018-01-06 13:33:26
I prefer stuff that's fast and cheap now, and even faster and cheaper in the future, than software that is currently slow and expensive, that may get fast and cheap in the future.
@_date: 2018-01-01 20:23:37
That's the case for almost all popular cryptocurrencies. It was an amazing year for crypto.
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:51:12

You can call them alts, that's fine.   
Just don't call them a "shitcoin" simply because they aren't Bitcoin.     
@_date: 2018-01-01 00:46:09


I understand. Some other CC's don't require this however.      


Wow. Damn. Didn't know that.
@_date: 2018-01-03 08:46:28
Ah, well, charts showed a pretty big increase, of about 1600$ iirc, in just two hours, on the USD charts.    
People speculate it's because an interview revealed that a big player somewhere bought a ton of BTC.
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:20:00
...no? They're not a scam...
@_date: 2018-01-19 20:43:14

"Bitconnect Song"...
@_date: 2018-01-04 13:59:33


Looks like you're very much aware of this one, considering you're ready to call all CC's that aren't Bitcoin "shitcoins".
@_date: 2018-01-20 21:25:46
It's like saying "Stop talking about engines, go to the engine sub, this is the car sub".      
LN is a vital part in getting Bitcoin in a good position again in terms of transactions. Without it's success I believe it's just a matter of time before another CC takes over its  spot.
@_date: 2018-01-04 22:35:02
This man seems credible.
@_date: 2018-01-20 21:26:48
It's not recommended to mine Bitcoin with regular computers.
@_date: 2018-01-04 11:22:28
Indeed, but Bitcoin does have the insane TX issues.     
If *problem of other CC* didn't affect *other CC*, they would certainly be doing better!    
Of course they would.
@_date: 2018-01-24 20:46:48
Hadn't really considered that, yeah.
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:52:08
Some exchanges have a difference in Buy and Sell prices.     
The lower one may have been the sell price, while the higher was the buy price.      
Also, you mention losing 200-300, which makes me think you bought a full BTC. I just want to mention that it is possible to buy parts of a Bitcoin, if that's ever relevant in any of your future trades.
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:49:37
It indeed isn't. This is the origin of Hodl.
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:11:37
Nobody thinks it's by accident, maybe that it shouldn't have the largest market cap, but not that it's accidental.

"can save the world".     
Really? Really, mate?
@_date: 2018-01-01 23:01:27
All Bitcoin related ads I'm getting promote it.     
Why would you spend money advertising for nothing, after all?
@_date: 2018-01-01 22:49:02
Link to your exchange?
@_date: 2018-01-05 13:24:23
Yeah, that's just factually incorrect. Coinmarketcap shows a 24h volume of 2.744B for TRX/BTC
@_date: 2018-01-04 22:36:25
That's because Coinbase/GDAX are congested. Coinbase states on their website that ETH sends are delayed due to massive amounts of users.
@_date: 2018-01-04 14:27:01
I wonder when the next time this happens is. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 11:15:37
How would they not be?
@_date: 2018-01-01 09:23:46
@_date: 2018-01-01 00:44:43
Actually, I don't.
@_date: 2018-01-03 08:42:12
Have you ever considered that it's possible there's a better implementation of this use case out there, that's newer and less known?
@_date: 2018-01-02 08:23:00
Not for me. I've seen a ton of pro BTC ads. But then again, they use your search history and whatnot, and I haven't been googling much about any altcoins on my phone
@_date: 2018-01-10 22:15:27
I wouldn't trust any second-hand site with something that will have my money on it.
@_date: 2018-01-05 07:47:03
Ah, I misread. My bad.
@_date: 2018-01-03 08:43:17
Agreed, well said
@_date: 2018-01-20 08:59:31
No, they don't.     
Perhaps a very small percentage of completely green traders, but that definitely isn't the reason why some people own alts.
@_date: 2018-01-20 08:50:52
Right.     
And what makes this person qualified to say this? What proof do they have? Why should I believe it?
@_date: 2018-01-04 14:01:07
You mean the coins that don't need this stuff implemented, because they don't have these issues?     
@_date: 2018-01-04 22:50:59
Are you sure the small amount aren't leftovers from before? It's possible the actual transaction hasn't arrived yet.
@_date: 2018-01-03 14:25:14
Are you sure? Have you researched literally all other cryptos to see if any of them implement it better?
@_date: 2018-01-04 14:24:13
How do I seem upset, lol.
@_date: 2018-01-04 14:09:04
What? Lmao.     
You're acting like a pathetic child, mate.     
Are you upset?
@_date: 2018-01-27 21:04:45
Highly doubt it
@_date: 2018-01-05 10:58:50
What are you talking about? TRX's 24h Volume is 2.11B, 24,34% of the total volume of the exchange in the last 24h.       
Bitcoin is only at 362M, a mere 4% of the 24h volume. (On Binance).     
      
Edit: My mistake. TRX/BTC is 2.11B. The total of TRX is actually at ~2.6B or ~30%.
@_date: 2018-01-01 00:33:41


This isn't FUD... You realise my scenario is only a concern when Bitcoin has already turned into a viable currency, and has already grown an enormous amount?     
Also, what? Where in this sub did you ever find racism?
@_date: 2018-01-10 07:51:08
That's gonna be confusing as hell.     
Everyone is going to think "Bitcoin" is BTC, while it's BCH there, and people are going to think "Bitcoin Legacy" is one of the god knows how many forks like Bitcoin Gold, Cash, Diamond, etc.      
What a terrible move.
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:24:00
It's going up after being relatively stable for a few days, it's not much, but certainly not nothing.     
@_date: 2018-01-20 21:22:18
Well, yeah. People *hate* to have their currency changed.      
In the Netherlands people used a currency called "Gulden", until it was replaced with the Euro. Despite how easy it was to change it (Just go to a bank and they will take your old and give your new, and your bank holdings were automatically changed) compared to having a Bitcoin wallet with security phrases, passwords, potentially having to own/buy cold wallets or hardware wallets, people still hated that they had to do it.     
@_date: 2018-01-05 11:03:32
LN (Lightning Network).     
Implementation will take a while though, I'm sure.
@_date: 2018-01-10 22:11:19
Depends, does this person have insider information?
@_date: 2018-01-20 21:30:45


I didn't, actually.


Yeah, in the case I mentioned the change was because Europe (or at least most of Europe) changed to the Euro. Unless *everyone* believes in and understands crypto, I doubt crypto will take over the role of fiat.    
Especially considering paying with fiat is (currently) a lot more convenient than paying with CC's.
@_date: 2018-01-05 10:56:00
Not sure where you found that, but it's not on their site. Why don't you take a look at their whitepaper?
@_date: 2018-01-06 09:15:24
How about the infamous Bitcoin Cash? Purely when it comes to security? Considering its faster and cheaper.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:00:06
Just know, it could crash. Putting all of your earnings into Bitcoin is certainly risky, to say the least.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:24:16
What a great dip. 10/10 would buy again
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:13:19
Price-averaging is indeed a great way to reduce the chance of losses.     
Also, it's currently at an ATH, meaning anything you bought before this has made money, unless you prematurely sold (tsk tsk)
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:35:38
Can't wait :)
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:00:07
Just look at Ripple and that's the chart you see for "Last week", hah
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:57:36
The next dip could also start in two hours.     
I prefer not guessing and hoping, but just waiting for a dip to be happening already, and trying to buy when the price is already low.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:29:06
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:09:23
Man, this Bitcoin thing really brought along some stupid millionaires then.
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:30:18
Because inexperienced people might not be aware how to make (what would be considered) smart decisions based on charts.
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:34:57
To be fair I can imagine this is a pretty hard time for a mod.     
Especially considering most mods here are probably curious what the price is gonna do, like the rest of it.
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:41:20
You don't have to buy a full Bitcoin. You can just buy parts.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:12:09

Yeah, hadn't considered that.    
He seems like a guy who would.
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:49:18
The danger is predicting the bottom line. In order to get the amount to break even as low as possible, you want to continue to buy if it continues to dip. If the dip is (way) longer than you expected, you've either lost the ability to continue due to lack of funds (leaving the breaking even point high) or you have to invest more than you're perhaps willing to.     
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:31:13

Update: It's ~30 now! Must HODL!
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:32:56
I've been doing this as well!   
It's quite helpful imo.     
     
Easy explanation:    
Say, price is at 19k, it drops to 15.     
I decide that may be the end of the dip.     
I set up ~5 Buy orders, 1k apart, ranging from 15k to 10k (sometimes when I feel like it I'll set up a buy order every 250$, but that's more effort).     
If the price then drops further, to 10k, I only have to wait for the price to get to the average value I bought at, which is 12.5k in this case, to get a profit.      
If I didn't set those orders, I would have been in big on 15k, which meant I needed the price to get to 15k before I broke even.      
This method results in less risk/reward, which is generally a fairly good thing in trading. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:13:49
Except Ripple is also dropping.      
Everything is dropping.     
Ripple is outperforming all other top 10 currencies, though.

Do you want to panic sell?     
Yes: Don't, check if you have more money spare, if so, invest it now that price is low.     
No: good. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:26:54
Do you really think this does anything even remotely positive, for anyone?
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:34:57
"been waiting for a bit of a dip".      
His method is a ton smarter than what other newcomers do, which is to just buy at ATH.
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:44:37
Same here...     
I'd be buying all the way down, probably. After all, if you buy X every minute during a decline, in the end you only need the sell price to recover to `(price when first buying the dip + lowest price of the dip) / 2` for you to break even, while you would need it to recover all the way to the price from the first moment you buy the dip if you just buy once.      
This method is a lot more risky though, as you're investing a lot more, and you need to have the funds ready to be able to use the method for a large dip. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:37:53
We're going places.
@_date: 2017-12-28 07:25:05
His could be really cheap depending on the size of the transfer....     
For all we know he's sending thousands of BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:48:37
How about when a BTC owner passes away? Are those coins locked from the marker forever?
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:01:41
Just keep it on the exchange. The chance of it getting stolen, alongside how little you lose if it does, make transferring it into a private wallet not worth it. At least not with these fees.    
The fees are slowly going down as the public hype from 10-20k slowly dies. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:40:19
You learned a valuable lesson at a young age. It's probably better that way.

Or:     
-Bitcoin down massive 30% in a single day! Bubble burst!      
      
It's all about money. Everything is about money. And as long as  gets them more money, it's not going to change.

Of course I wouldn't be happy about it, but I wouldn't be hurting, if the price dropped to 0.

@_date: 2017-12-11 00:07:26
The volatility isn't the same, there seems to be more of it.    
Not terribly much, but still more.     
Potentially just market reacting to what seems to be "nothing".     
      
Edit: The volatility seems to be less bad than I thought it was.
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:09:12
Especially considering it clearly has value. For that guy, it's roughly 80k of value.     
He's probably upset he sold it before it rose in value, and is trying to make Ripple seem bad in his head, so his decision doesn't seem so bad.
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:26:10

Taking a loan on your house to buy a volatile currency is so risky, that it shouldn't be done because "it worked for someone". That's *almost* like a lottery winner saying "it really works! Just buy a ticket!".

This is so true. If you could look into the future, everyone would just buy the winning lottery ticket or invest in something that will explode.

Considering 10k --&gt; 1m means a 10000% increase of Bitcoin price, which means if he bought at 16k, Bitcoin price would have to be 1.6m a coin.

@_date: 2017-12-11 21:17:23






Exactly, guessing that the value is about to rise 2k when it's at 17k isn't something you should do, but if the price is at 14k in a massive dip, it's probably a decently safe bet that the price will go back up again.     
I guess the difference is that the only way to make more money by day-trading is by *always* buying in dips and *always* selling op tops. This is unrealistic for anyone to successfully do, without at least having a lot of prior knowledge.
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:51:31

He understands perfectly well that you're gatekeeping
@_date: 2018-06-04 11:30:31
No, I would not have bought at 3k. I don't buy ATH. I would have probably layered buys from 2300-1300ish.
@_date: 2018-06-04 11:41:36
Because I tend to place buys between 70-40% of ATH to try and catch a crash
@_date: 2018-06-04 07:07:42
Obviously, however buying at the literal all time high, at prices way higher than previous ATH's, there's a greater than 50% chance that it's going to be near the top.
@_date: 2018-06-04 20:27:42
You see, my method for buys is pretty easy:   
-Dont fomo.     
-Have buys between 40 and 70% of the previous top that I deem "notable".     
     
@_date: 2018-06-04 07:06:30

Agreed. Kind of like how stocks are gambling. It's gambling with some thought involved.     


Doubt it, honestly. There are a ton of cryptocurrencies, each with their own goals. I wouldn't be surprised if in 5 years a multitude of cryptocurrencies are seeing large implementation, for multiple goals, even if Bitcoin stays on top for its own goal.

Naturally, or they would've never done it.
@_date: 2018-03-08 08:03:54
If they wanted quick profit, they would have sold earlier. I'm not sure they're going to continue selling.
@_date: 2018-03-04 20:09:48
I'd guess it's because quite a few of those linked ones are meant for paying bills. I'm assuming they allow you to pay bills without having to convert to fiat yourself.      
That does seem a little bit fishy though, and I'm sure they still have fees.
@_date: 2018-03-09 20:54:45
He's also likely not real.      
What actual human being would respond with "I don't believe that" to someone who's clearly interested in Cryptos who said "Bitcoin is the first crypto". That's the point where you can't backpedal anymore. You just admit ignorance/not knowing/making it up/only reading the headline, etc.
@_date: 2018-03-04 20:14:03
Actually, potentially less than time involved.     
Rather than solely relying on dollar cost averaging to give you a decent average over time, getting paid in fiat means you can choose when you want to convert, potentially leading to more profit with some experience and/or knowledge.      
      
Furthermore, I'd argue it's incredibly ignorant to "not accept fiat anymore". I wonder if that guy would turn down jobs if they only pay fiat.      
Also, I'm not really a fan of "middleman" services converting my job's payments for me. It seems awfully risky.
@_date: 2018-03-09 21:37:14

Since when does marketcap relative to the market cap of other cryptos equal stability?

I'm not passing judgement either way, it's just that if you think "This guy doesn't actually believe this", it will seem funny and satirical, while if you think "This guy actually believes this nonsense", you can't really consider the blatant absurdity funny. Or at least, I can't.

How curious, especially considering I'm also Dutch, and nobody I know seems to have heard about any CC recently.
@_date: 2018-03-04 21:51:27
Highly doubt it.    
Also, one guy who chooses to only get paid in BTC doesn't necessarily indicate that "times are changing".
@_date: 2018-02-13 20:36:38
That's fair.
@_date: 2018-03-04 20:19:00
Yeah, thought so. I'd rather use an exchange directly. That way I can sort of control the fees.     
We all know every middleman will take a percentage. That's how they can sustain themselves. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 07:39:08
The result would be more expensive power for everyone, until new miners are disincentivised due to the high power costs, at which point the amount of power consumed by Bitcoin and other CCs will stagnate.     
Sadly, this results in way more expensive power for everyone, kind of like what has already happened with Graphics cards, but potentially on a larger scale.

Who? When? What gives them any credibility whatsoever?
@_date: 2018-02-24 07:31:41
He has no real reason not to say it.    
It's not like he gave out his passkey. Plus, 0.25 is such a perfect round number that so many wallets have it, meaning you won't be able to find out which wallet is his either.    
And that's assuming he doesn't have something like 0.2468282 instead.

It was a test flight. The goal was to test their equipment and skills. You realise this rocket is larger than any previous rocket by a factor of 2?     
Did you see the landing? If that doesn't show great technology I don't know what does.      
In order to test properly, they had to use cargo. They just chose to turn their cargo into a publicity stunt.     
      
The whole thing definitely was more of a showcase of technology, as well as being a test flight, than it was a publicity stunt, though.

I think he meant "dox", which means giving away someone's personal, private information, such as license plate, full name, address, etc.

Not trying to shit on your parade here, but the first doesn't always succeed. Just look at just about anything related to the internet. Almost all successful companies have had predecessors that failed or performed worse.     
Calling Bitcoin "the Internet" seems a bit premature, don't you think? For all we know it might turn out to be the MySpace in a few years.       
With other words, it's too early to tell whether Bitcoin will "win". Keep in mind, when "The internet won" in your analogy, that was it. There were no more other competing "internets", while there are still competing cryptos.

Not quite, but if a recent post I saw is accurate, the odds of any random guess to be the correct key is roughly the same as the odds to win the Powerball... 7 times in a row.

Indeed. Also, the free Pokémon app had more going for it than just being free: it's 100% through the internet. No shipping. No time until it works. No hastle to get it. Can be used anywhere.

I'm gonna be real here.     
The population increase since then isn't that large. It's definitely more to do with the increase in wealth, knowledge and information availability, as well as how companies have a ton more options to grow due to the Internet.

Plus, This is an entirely different time than when some of those products were introduced.      
Everything new and promising will grow faster due to the internet's enormous reach.

Or that he sold near the top and rebought lower.

Oh, man, that's a larger growth than I expected. However, I still stand by my point that the Internet is a bigger contributor to gaining 50m users than the ~6x growth of mankind.

I'm with this guy. Tether is about to moon my dudes.

Are you okay?      
How did you get to the conclusion that I am acting like "some VIP"?

Not that relevant in my opinion.


This most likely isn't Bitcoin.      


1) Almost all of them.      
2) Most resilient is hard to say, as very few have actually had any even remotely successful hostile takeovers, but yes, Bitcoin will be up there.    


That's irrelevant. People aren't going to use MySpace because they were the pioneers of a "genre" of company, for example.




Indeed, and everyone has the right to ask this question for themselves. I do recognize that a majority of people would choose Bitcoin, by the way.      




I agree. However, if/when this hits "mainstream" where the regular joes get involved, you will likely see that a percentage won't care much for anonymity, or decentralisation, and those people might choose for a more "insurable" place to store their funds. That's why I'm not confident that Bitcoin will end up as a clear  way above everything else.

Very likely, yes
