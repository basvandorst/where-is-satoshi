Ok, I have added text to substantiate the centralization claim. Thank you for your assistance.

You are correct, yes. I will work on putting something together to insert when time allows but for the sake of brevity, the focus here is on the solution with the intended audience being those who already recognize a problem.

I did not think it was necessary, my apologies. Let me find a couple links to put here as this topic has been covered rather thoroughly. 
edit: Here is one article I found with a quick search. There are many more

Unfortunately greed is strong in human nature and therefore centralized systems tend to be corrupt - especially when it comes to finance. Decentralization was just a nice idea in the past with no way to implement it. Bitcoin has brought the dream to life, but more work is needed to fine tune the system.

We cannot say for certain that all of the 'rich' will stake their Bitcoin, but if they do, I think it is only fair that they have more say in the network. They have a more substantial financial investment in the network and are therefore most inclined to act honestly in the network. I will not deny that better wealth distribution of Bitcoin would be ideal, but I do not have a solution to propose for that issue yet lol.
