Thanks I'll look at that.

Wow that's very low... I never saw a limit on the ATM itself, it has always been linked to my bank. (and then I had another limit if I was outside my country: I remember that when I bought cameras in Hong-Kong).
But 300-400 seems extremely low, what if you want to pay cash a expensive restaurant for 5-10 people ?

How do you buy bitcoin in Norway? Do you buy them in NOK? Do you have more general information about bitcoin an Norway?  
I live in Norway and I'm interested in BTC but I never looked too much in where I can buy some.
@_date: 2014-02-17 11:20:32
Just another question, I'm doing a bit of reading about Norway and Bitcoin. And I saw that 2 months ago there was some talking about getting taxed for owning BTC in norway?  Is it still actual?

[according to OP he traded bitcoins for dollars to purchase the car](
So he had the money for the car in BTC. How he got that amount of bitcoins I don't know but he had it so except if he is paid in bitcoins he probably made these bictoins by trading or by buying them early

Call your bank to raise your limit for a one time only. 
If you're trying to withdraw lots of money, you probably planned it anyway.
@_date: 2014-02-17 08:44:37
Takk !
@_date: 2014-03-03 20:55:44
Hehe :) Yeah, a bit of miscommunication :)
@_date: 2014-05-14 13:58:42
Right... Because homeland security cares about your 500/1000 USD withdrawal... It's such a big amount.

@_date: 2014-05-14 13:48:49
Ok thanks I see.  
@_date: 2014-02-17 13:43:33


Ok so if I'm trying with just few thousands NOK I should be under the threshold? (Do you have a official link from skattetaten for that by the way?)


Ok, so this will only happen to me if I sale bitcoins right? If I purchase bitcoin via Justcoin for example, I don't have to pay VAT. And if I buy smoked sausages the VAT will be included in the price and the owner of the sausages business will have to see that with the state.   
But if I start trading my bitcoins after thei valued increased, I will have to pay 28% on that?

OP didn't buy the car with bitcoins. He made money with bitcoin and then bought the car with the money. The title should be **"Another Tesla bought with money made by trading currencies"**
@_date: 2014-05-14 13:44:37
Yes I was talking about a daily limit (I had a rolling week limit actually but same principle).  
I'm just surprised that the limit in US ATM is so low that's all, it seems so unrelated with the salaries and cost of life there (or maybe I'm over evaluating these two). 
But then I understand better when I got my CC info stolen why some guy withdrew only 400 USD in Miami... That was probably the limit.
@_date: 2014-02-17 14:01:17
Thanks !


Good advice! (see what I did here...)  
But seriously, this is why I was asking for links and source to get the info by myself.

Thanks. Now I have to dig up my megadrive...
@_date: 2013-11-07 10:20:17
Oh ok then!
@_date: 2013-05-28 14:16:17
Actually I was thinking something later (like the Saturn or something like that) that was pretty unknown :D
@_date: 2013-08-05 15:25:59
woow it's really interesting. thanks !

What is the bitcoin node which is in the sea at he west of Africa ?
It looks it's exactly at the cross of Greenwich meridian and the Equator, so it's maybe where the "unknown location" go ?
@_date: 2013-11-06 13:54:50
So... it's working even when it's not working?

fiat currency is not super stable all the time no.  
But you cannot say that BTC is stable right now.

or try doing it via duckduckgo !

Damn, your website has a pretty bad rep:  
*EDIT: apparently there seems to be both very good ratings and both very bad ...*

Especially since it does not look to have any logic behind... I cannot understand the apparent randomness of the L and the O.
