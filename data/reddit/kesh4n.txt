I am sorry to tell you this. But it is not about having a functional LN in 2018. It is too LATE. You would need to make it happen in the next 2 MONTHS else it is doomed. Believe it or not. Screenshot this. And when between March and May ''Bitcoin'' gets completely f'ed remember what I said.

Read this. A hard fork. If everyone agrees to update does not result in a chain split.

Garbage article.

Hard forks don't necessarily have to result in a chain split.

To be fair if you would have invested in BCH when it was 300$ then you could have 10 times the money now, or more. So how does this make the richer richer and the poorer stay poor? Each individual makes their own choices. And this tweet makes zero sense whatsoever.

Non mining nodes barely contribute anything to the network. So why run one when it's not needed ?
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:41:34
Should I have known that beforehand? And in any case since you are most likely mine to a pool, you are still not required to run a full node. So please do explain what I am missing here.

Ah it's an organized attack again. Not the fact that the 1MB limit is what broke the network. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:44:03
Yes. It is. Even 1GB blocks are possible.

Move over to a coin that actually works, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, Dash, whatever you prefer. It is very obvious that Bitcoin became rich people's and the government's plaything, poorer people and poor countries are already priced out. If you think this will be better with LN (coming soon, maybe in 2019) it won't, it will only help big companies somewhat.

Bitcoin fucked her over with high fees and being only 1 inch. Now she went over to the other guy that has 8 inches and basically no fees.

ATM's generally charge a 5-7% fee. Plus there is a fee when you buy BTC, not worth it.

You are guilty of wrong think !!! /S

I like how that the first time someone posted the link to his post, it got deleted soon enough. Because the title of the post was roughly the same as what he said in the tweet.
But when someone bashes him for what he says. The thread won't get deleted and will stay up.
Basically, bashing Bitcoin Cash on this sub is okay, it seems like, saying anything positive about it, and your post will get deleted or you'll get banned. 
What a great sub!

Because he does not know either.
