For some reason, as he said: "Your feedback has definitely been recorded!", I imagined an evil customer support rep laughing obnoxiously while hitting his delete key.

That was the most force I've ever put into pressing my mouse button to give a downvote. Good god, are these people serious?

I'm rather disappointed with this update. I understand it was released in advance to fill the void of a missing app, but there's a lot of functional elements that need to be fixed, and it looks like this update focused more on UI redesign.
1. 'bits' display on the recent transactions tab cuts off the last two numbers. For example, if you have 1 BTC, or 1,000,000 bits, it displays "1,000,0 bits". In addition to this, on the wallets tab, it cuts off only the last number. Referencing the above example, 1 BTC would be shown as 1,000,00 bits". Inconsistent with the above example, and still not correct. 
2. In the send BTC tab, there is still no drop down for selecting a wallet to send funds from. The left/right arrows are extremely buggy, and pressing them selects a random wallet. Imagine a case where someone has 100 wallets. It would be extremely frustrating for them to use the send functionality. At least give us a way to set a default "send" wallet. 
3. There is still no way to set a default fee, or change it on a tx by tx basis.
There was a lot of time when offline work could have been completed in anticipation for a policy change from Apple.  I'm sorry to sound a bit harsh, I've just come to expect more from one of, if not the largest player(s) in the industry. Demand exists for a better product, and myself and others will start searching elsewhere if Blockchain.info can't provide it.

It's ok guys, he doesn't *get* it. To be honest, someone with this much emotion playing into their investments, shouldn't be invested in new groundbreaking technology. Especially when the investment into that technology itself can be broken out into units, and those units can be converted directly to fiat currency.

Whiskey Dicks in Orlando FL had started accepting Bitcoin sometime in 2011 or 2012. They have since stopped and removed the sticker from their door. 
I e-mailed to ask why, and the owner (I'm guessing) replied that they just got too busy on certain days to be able to process the Bitcoin transactions, so they've stopped accepting it.
I can vouch for this, this bar is frequently packed to the brim and you can't move without bumping in to multiple people. While I was never able to actually use Bitcoin here, I can see how it could be difficult.

Agreed. I would be disappointed to see the community dump $45,000 into Pheeva's marketing. There's a lot more that could be done with that money towards Bitcoin development &amp; growth. Plus, this is the Bitcoin bowl. You better believe Bitpay &amp; whoever else will already have commercials airing, paid for by themselves, for that matter.
@_date: 2014-09-25 20:08:10
What if that is worth $2500 when the announcement is made?
@_date: 2014-10-02 19:05:10
Don't forget Square.
@_date: 2014-07-30 15:53:17
Right, but they do at least explicitly state that all payment methods will continue to be accepted.
@_date: 2014-11-11 19:26:42
Thanks for doing this.

Doesn't NFC work while offline? Hardware solution on merchant end would present the transaction, the phone would sign it offline via NFC (assuming your phone has the capability to this, which would mean the private key would need to be local), the merchant hardware broadcasts the transaction to the Blockchain, and transaction completes. 
What am I missing?
@_date: 2014-10-06 16:10:49
Haha that would be so funny if we hadn't heard the exact same joke over and over again for the past 3 months. 
@_date: 2014-05-29 16:18:47
Don't forget they also just integrated two huge features, device authentication, and user names. 
They've also really stepped it up in the customer support category. Coinbase is doing big things.

You can submit feedback to CNBC telling them how much you enjoyed the documentary here: 
I think they'd move it over to TV with enough feedback. 
@_date: 2014-11-19 18:20:08
Agreed. This is a pretty crummy effort.
@_date: 2014-11-06 13:48:07
Thank you :)
@_date: 2014-11-04 17:57:38
This is incredible. Some very high level thinking here, James. Thank you for opening my eyes.
@_date: 2014-09-23 12:49:45
It's threads like this that remind me of why I was excited for Bitcoin in the first place.  
Thanks for reinforcing that I really don't care what the price is.
@_date: 2014-09-08 17:21:55
Wow. This is great.
@_date: 2014-02-12 15:44:14
Could you please comment on if this is related to problems regarding 'Shared Send'? I have been unable to access this feature for some time now. A drop down box which says "loading" causes issues.
@_date: 2014-09-25 20:28:31
And if it's $0.25?

I appreciate Blockchain.info's cautious approach for the protection of itself and its users. Thanks for your service.
@_date: 2014-11-06 14:07:17
Seems like this could be abused pretty badly.
@_date: 2014-11-03 16:28:25
Mind if I ask, what was wrong with it the first time you tried it?
@_date: 2014-05-05 15:40:13
I had chills throughout nearly the entire presentation. Very well done.

Converted? ~55%. 
It has grown into quite a bit more, though.
1. I am comfortable with this, however it keeps BTC on my mind more than I'd like.
2. I'll begin to rebalance towards a 50/50 ratio at $1800-$2200 dependent upon market sentiment.

Palmer loves Bitcoin. He's said publicly his biggest regret is not buying more bitcoin.

I guess I take the side of, if you don't like it, make something better. If you can't make something better, pay someone to make you something better.

Hey James,
Thanks for your YouTube videos, they really helped with my understanding and I send them to anyone looking for more info on Bitcoin.
I'm looking forward to watching your interviews.

I understand you're frustrated. I am too. But, what you did not mention, is that this 18 months of downward pressure followed a meteoric 2 month increase in value from sub $100 levels to $1150. How naive are we to think this wouldn't happen?
@_date: 2013-12-04 21:46:49
This thread called out to me because I spend most of my time on reddit browsing the and I agree with you and think that both of these technologies are the some of, if not the biggest technological innovations that we, and future generations have to look forward to.
I get to play with the HD dev kit tomorrow! :)

You should consider adjusting your price to reflect used hardware. With the announcement that Oculus will be shipping a second dev kit in the near future, and the fact that the "I'll be the first one to experience it!" phase has passed, you've lost a lot of potential buyers. 
I wouldn't pay more than $150 for a used dev kit 1 as of right now, but that's  probably just me.
