You could fund a developer bounty for counterparty, that runs on Bitcoin.
Coders will code for that, users will benefit from the functionality of the platform later on.
They are looking to fun SegWit support, which will reduce the transaction fees for all too.
Wikipedia and the EFF are nice too. Some say that Wikipedia does not need extra donations, they get more than they can spend. There are a lot of smaller projects that need more attention.

I think that inflationary systems force people to compete, while deflationary systems give an option to corroborate by increasing the wealth across the system.
It's like building an economy all together, instead of destroying the lives of the poorest by inflating away their options to get stuff that they need.

You forgot the date of the Newspaper. Tor can not fake newspaper dates and the human need for sleep, while also being forced to work on Monday.
The Times was delivered on a Sunday morning and was read by Nakamoto on the exact same day before 15:00 at least, because he would have needed a few hours to review the code one more time, before generating the first block with a properly dated message.
He did not go on and he did not generate a second block until the next weekend, because it was a sunny Sunday and because he was tired from reviewing of the code and maybe because his favorite show was on TV. **Which means that he is locked in a time zone of an evening,** which is in UK or EU. Japan and US is out of options for the reason that people need to sleep before work.

Suddenly you would become noteworthy for Wikipedia editors :)

We both know that.
What is the location where people use serial commas, while also using the EU date format, while passionately reading UK papers in London time zone and using German web services for personal projects.
Does not sound like USA or Asia for sure.
@_date: 2014-03-07 07:10:36




@_date: 2014-03-07 03:58:35
Correct you are. You just confirmed the location of Nakamoto.
Oxford is the only place in UK, that requires to use serial commas in serious scientific papers in addition to the EU date format that UK Nakamoto uses, but the US Nakamoto would not.
**Oxford does have a strong cryptographer base, while most US elementary schools do not.**

I hate serial commas and hyphens, I also do dislike how Nakamoto used them instead of just using dots to break up his points.

Nobody is forcing you to digest information as it was written. You are very welcome to develop your own theory about the location of Nakamoto at the time of the genesis block.

Ok. Good to know.

Do you also use EU date formats and read UK newspapers in your mornings, while writing in Oxford academic style for a living, while magically preferring German web services instead of all other ones ?

I think so too. So, I try to start a conversation about alternatives to basic income.
@_date: 2014-03-07 03:43:51
Wikipedia speaks otherwise.
Serious Oxford scientific papers do require Serial Commas to avoid misunderstanding of false connections or false binary logic. Which is an annoyance and an indication for the location of Nakamoto, who was trained to use Serial Commas during his education.
@_date: 2014-11-03 08:10:18
The idea about inflationary systems is that everybody is forced to earn more and to compete with others, while losing all purchasing power in the end.
In a deflationary system collaboration is by default and purchasing power is rising without the need to work harder than others.
@_date: 2014-03-07 06:01:02
That guy speaks in a super broken English, while Nakamoto spend a lot of time using upper level English at work.

People in Switzerland are highly educated, they will not vote for anything that is controversial as long as they are doing well. They vote on all kind of proposals, but they too did not have the power over central banks.
@_date: 2014-03-07 15:36:36
Quite right you are. Only older Germans would use serial commas, since it was part of the old grammar habits.
One German immigrant or one UK immigrant to Germany, with long experience in UK, could use serial commas obsessively and also use the German GMX for his eMail, because he got used to the personal eMail that was ether web.de or GMX for most Germans around the year 2000.
@_date: 2014-03-07 06:20:58
Because that German guy has trouble with speaking clear English. The accent is super German for sure. It is OK for tourism, but not for being able to write spotless academic papers in English.
He can not be better than most native speakers, while failing to speak proper English 'th' and ''sh'' sounds. The writing of Nakamoto is better than most people in UK can do, so Nakamoto has been writing academic papers for multiple years before generating the genesis block.

Took some time to research, so it is serious.

East Canada could also be remotely possible, if The Times is published in there on the same night as in UK.
@_date: 2014-03-07 03:22:15
**Thank you for confirming my point.**
If Dorian is not working, then he could not care less, if it is weekend or Monday, but Nakamoto did work hard to launch first block on the last day of a long weekend, because he has to go to work on the next day.
The second block was generated on the next weekend, which only is logical if Nakamoto is limited to work on weekends.
@_date: 2014-11-03 10:51:27
I claim that **deflationary systems promote collaborative creation of wealth,** while the inflationary systems force the destruction of value for everybody at once.

You are trolling, but I still reply with facts:
Time zone of Dorian does not fit the generation of the first block and the newspaper that was delivered during UK morning time which was Night time in LA.
It was the last weekend day, so Dorian can not stay up all night and magically expect a newspaper headline from a far away UK that will motivate him to generate first block after no sleep time and then go to work on the next day.
@_date: 2014-03-07 07:06:26
**Thank you for proving me correct one more time.**
Bad code means that Nakamoto is not coding for a living. It also means that he did not plan or polish his code, while waiting for the suitable news article.
Nakamoto reacted spontaneously and genuinely to the article in The Times. Very few people outside of UK would start generating the final lines of unpolished code from being motivated by UK politics, while being so passionate that they want to get it done on the same day as the news came out.
@_date: 2014-03-07 06:40:06
**Does not compute, because a group would not stop the work and resume on weekends simultaneously.**
Dose not compute for governmental employees also, because they work during week days and generate code during week days.
It would be super strange, if governmental coders would only work on weekends and stop during week days.

+ **Audio version:** 
 in the waves of emotions and ideas.
The sunny days make us happy and the rainy days can do this too. The different atmosphere of the weather can influence our internal mood. We become more friendly, if we are happy for a long period of time. At the opposite side, we can become very negative, if we are not happy from the internal core of our emotions. There are special places and the special people who can make a significant change in our life. Those special people can create a spark in our life. **A spark that can ignite a fire of love** and the new passion to enjoy life.
The romantic connections are like magic. We often meet the people who are in the same location as we are. But sometimes we can meet our love in a distant place, where we are free from the emotions of our daily life. It could be any place. It could be the large public space of the Internet. Or it could be in a warm coffee shop in Amsterdam. The similar people go to the similar places. Those people meet there and they create a strong emotional connection.
Sometimes our emotions and our thoughts bring us to the distant location, where we meet the similar people who have the same emotions and thoughts. Similar people do attract each-other like the waves attract the surfers, because our emotions and goals in life do push us to the places where our emotions and dreams can become reality. Our emotions are like the rivers that bring us to the ocean. The different emotions bring us to the different emotional oceans, because the different emotions are like the different rivers that travel to the different **coast of the emotional oceans.** There are many different emotional oceans. We can select to travel to the beaches of those oceans, if we select our emotional river that we use as the path to the final emotional destination in our life.
Roger was a brave, young man, who did believe that the future is bright and colorful. He thought that he could achieve anything, if he kept working hard and stay focused on the goals, that he created for himself. He was motivated and focused. The time is a powerful force. It is hard to stay focused, if the hard work does not create the expected results. Roger was operating his business for a long time. The initial goals were to be very rich and happy. The final result was different. Roger did become rich. He did become very rich, but not happy. He bought a very expensive car and a very expensive flat in the center of Tokyo. His wife was very attractive and he did love her, but he did not feel complete. His environment did change, but the emotions did not. The money and the car did not bring the emotions that he did hope to collect as a reward for his hard work. The desire to be accepted and loved was burning his soul.
He felt that he had everything, but nothing at the same time, because he felt that nobody can understand his ideas about life and politics. Yes, the politics were very important for Roger. He did not like the government, because he had a legal conflict at a very early stage of his life. This legal accident did burn his soul. He did become very upset with the government. He felt that the government is evil and is breaking the life of everybody. He thought that the government is the enemy and that **nobody can see what he can see.** When he spoke to the other people about this, then the people did smile and left the conversation as fast as they could. The desire to be accepted did not meet the internal emotions. He thought that nobody can understand him and that he is all alone in the group of many people around him.
He was wrong. He was very wrong. There were similar people like him, but they were in the different location. He was not able to meet them where he was.
**At the other side of the world,** another young man was feeling the same emotions of disappointment about the government and the economy. Theymos was a young man with a passion for the politics and technology. Theymos believed that the government is spreading lies and wrong information. He believed that it would be very good for the society, if we stop the people who spread harmful information and the ideas that are not positive. He thought that there is no value in the open political discussion of the radical people, and that the governments create confusion, so that we are separated and can not unite against the dictatorship of the politicians.
Roger and Theymos did never meet, but they had very similar ideas. They believed that the government is evil and we must do every possible trick that will stop this evil. Both of them did believe that it would be more ethical to do the unethical things, if we can protect a large population from **the evil of the dangerous information** that the people exchange in an open discussion. They did believe that the wrong type of discussion can create evil and remove us from the goal of becoming free from the power of the governments. Both of the young men were trapped in this mental trap for the last 10 years.
Roger and Theymos had no physical connection, but they had an emotional connection. This Emotional connection did bring them together without any plan or previous connections. Roger was working very hard. His business was successful. His personal life did suffer.  The stressful atmosphere and the angry customers did create an emotional hole in his heart. The brain can be stronger than the emotions, but the emotions are the one power that can give us meaning and hope in life. Roger needed that new hope. He decided to go on vacation to the beach, where he can feel free and play in the waves of the ocean. The sea is for everybody, the power of the waves is for everybody and all the people on the beach can enjoy the sun without any restriction. Roger did travel to the beach of Palolem in India, because he could be away from his daily life and concentrate on his emotions. He needed to be away from Tokyo, so that he can see his life from a different perspective.
Theymos was living at **the other side of the world.** He had a family. Two children and a wife that did love him. She accepted his strict ideas about the open discussion in the public space. She accepted that everybody has an opinion and that her husband can have an opinion too, but she was tired from the emotional stress that her mental separation from her husband did create an angry atmosphere at home. One day, Theymos was discussing his ideas about politics, and the restriction of the harmful speech. His wife asked him to take a break and give her some free space to relax. Theymos started to yell. He said many bad things. He said that the health of society is more important that the personal opinion or time for relaxation. He became angry. This situation did create a conflict that was too large for their marriage. Theymos felt sad and lost. He did know that he was right. He did know that he is in love with his wife, but he did also know that she will never accept his ideas. He felt alone.
Theymos decided that he needed to see something different. He needed to be in the place where the people are different, where the food is different, and where the culture is different too. Theymos went to India. He traveled around the large cities. He has seen the large temples in Nepal. Theymos got sick from the hight altitude of the mountains in Nepal. He booked a flight to Goa, and came to the relaxing beach of Paloem in India.
**The sun was soft,** and the air was already getting warmer. Theymos decided to swim in the sea, before the sun was too hot for being at the sunny beach of Goa. Roger was already playing in the waves. He woke up early and finished his yoga session at the beach. His mind was more relaxed, and he went to in the waves of the sea, so that he can calm his mind before he can go to the Internet for the communication with his office in Tokyo.
Theymos went into the waves, where Roger was already standing. Both men came to the same place from the different parts of the world. It is possible that it was an accident, but it is also possible that their emotions did bring them together. Theymos looked at Roger and asked him where he could find the nearest Internet access, where the men with alternative ideas can feel accepted and have a fast WiFi too. Roger felt curious. He said that his hotel has a good Internet access, and that he can share it with Theymos, if he can not find a better solution. He said that nobody will judge anybody in his hotel room, where the governments of the world have no power of what we should think or feel.
Theymos was surprised. He did not expect that a random man on the beach would say the words that he would think in his own mind. **Then the big wave came.** The wave pushed Roger into the body of Theymos. Both men had to swim together in the wave, until the shallow water near the beach. It was strange. Roger and Theymos did not expect to hug a man in the sea, when they woke up on that day. It did happen. Both men were attracted by the powerful force of their ideas. They were similar and the power of the waves did bring them closer. Maybe it was the universe, maybe it was god. Maybe it was luck.

Or put up the image file onto Wikimedia, under the public domain licence and your name to it, so that you get future jobs from it. You could even put a name as Graphic Design Artist on the image itself in small letters. Just like the central bankers put their name on each banknote :-)
@_date: 2017-09-20 14:52:48
yes, it's correct. The old banks are going to go away soon. From 2018, EU will make it more easy to have a banking licence. Orange will become a bank and they will offer banking service in the app. When a telco company can be bank, why not a BTC company ?
There are different types of banks. One can be a 100% custodial bank, and that would be OK. It's more like a service that you can charge people for, when they want to access their fund with ID or face, or name alone. Some people like it.
@_date: 2017-09-20 15:20:50

I think the banks will integrate crypto, when they find a good way to hold it in some secure way within their existing business.
Revolut is currently integrating BTC. The old banks are too slow, but they should have multy currency accounts, or their customers will run away.
The only reason for the banks to still exist is the SEPA transfers, ATMs, and the loans. When people switch away to use cards, then the ATMs become irrelevant. Then anyone can start an app and be a bank.
The ING is doing that when they enter new countries. Some banks do not have ATM networks. Like the ING, they do not have many ATMs, but they offer to withdraw cash in supermarkets, which is also good for the supermarkets.
**In the future**, the banks with ATM networks and offices will and are being replaced with the banks that provide survives in the apps, where customers can send money to anyone, and withdraw cash with a supermarket cashier as a form of purchasing cash, which is perfect for the supermarkets, since they do no have to deposit the cash physically.
**In short**, the bank offices and ATMs are currently being replaced by the apps. It's not that hard to imagine that some smarter banks will offer custodial BTC accounts too. It would be just another product within the app.

Which means more fiat is created to pay out those dividends ! There is no less fiat. It's only more and more.
It's not a zero sum game, when dividends are paid out. More and more fiat gets created every year. 20% to 30% on total life-expanses inflation in 10 years is common. Which means that we all lose 10% to 30% by default.
Work, work, work. Then somehow your work and savings are 30% less, than 10 years ago, when you were working hard.

Good Idea !
The best thing you can do for 3D printing at the moment, is to create a cheap filament extruder kit that can create cheap ABS or PLA filament from scrap or plastic chips.
So that people can sell it cheap on eBay or Amazon. Otherwise we will have to wait ages until the 3D printing is affordable for local production.
