Lol I love that “I’m not 16” I hate when kids say i’m only this many old.... Kids in Afghanistan are 10 years old blowing peoples brains out and surviving war lol but this 16 year old built an app in his house with everything his parents supplied him with, lets praise him lmao
Good looking app though!!!

I wouldn’t recommend getting into to many ICO’s, if you want to narrow your search, invest in a coin with a working product :) otherwise, to name a few, check out IOTA, WTC, VTC, and EOS
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:23:07
Use coinmarketcap.com to see the top MARKET CAP of coins, (top 20) Keep in mind that is the market cap only, does NOT mean the “best coins” and coinbase does instant debit card purchases I know that. And i am able to get my money off coinbase, to paypal, and from paypal, to my debit card within 1 hour :)

You COUULLLLLD invest into alts? A bit more risky(in the ever so slightest way) but the potential for doubling, tripling your money in weeks is so much higher. Bitcoin is great but its not the only one
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:45:22
Are you only on Coinbase? There are TONS of alts, I would suggest creating an account on Bittrex.com there is tons of potential goldmines there. Personally, I think POWR, IOTA, and VTC are some Safe, wonderful investments. Research them and see what they have to offer, Bitcoin is a nice (relatively) safe investment, and most here in the bitcoin thread are die hard Bitcoin fans, but there are are tons of coins with working products out there that have HUGE goals and connections

Did you try clicking withdraw?
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:24:22
Absolutely! Look at their whitepaper! Every coin has its own whitepaper (Or at least it should, wouldn’t invest if not) use coinmarketcap.com to see the prices and total money invested in the coins, if one peaks your interest for any reason, google the website for that coin :) if your interested in any coin in specific i’d be happy to direct you to correct info about it

Honestly with the way 2018 is going I agree, I miss last year
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:38:10
I wonder... I see these names are taken
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:33:15
Why else would you make a brand new account specifically to post here lmao cause you know you’re trashy and don’t want your main to be revealed. True enough to BTC to destroy BCH competition but not true enough to use your real Reddit identity.... SAD lmao social media suckerfish
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:51:20
6600 :) great time to get in! I’ve been buying low selling high and DAMN. Quite the profit tonight
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:36:40
I agree with you,
@_date: 2017-11-15 03:19:00
Pretty sure he did as a sales pitch, asking 1.2, no 0.5 BTC!!! Makes it that much more special
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:39:46
6800 now! What a dump!
@_date: 2017-11-14 04:45:52
What an idiot
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:03:25
Hopefully you’ll realize whats important once BCH is worth more than BTC :)
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:10:25
Absolutely, the original post of this had over 500 likes already we can definitely get to the bottom of this with the help of LocalBTC. I personally will send them this exact link, I encourage other to do the same. This BULLSHIT happening in the crypto space is ridiculous, anyone gets away with anything and it makes Crypto look even worse.
@_date: 2017-11-10 04:34:56
Same thing happened to me and it took 4 WEEKS FOR A REPLY! Try sending MULTIPLE emails, i sent like 30 and got told I’m sending too many before i got a response...
@_date: 2017-11-05 04:35:29
A good eye opener on how FUCKED we all are
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:16:45
I just wanna be a bitcoin billionaire!
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:16:18
Wow really? Mind sending me that source?
@_date: 2017-10-22 16:51:36
F1 for Moon
@_date: 2017-10-21 19:24:31
Damn, shoulda bought after the fork lol gonna correct HARD
@_date: 2017-10-28 15:21:01
Lol look at your account, you’re obviously just a troll act
@_date: 2017-10-28 14:32:33
Gambling where you have an advantage I suppose. Either way, My point remains lol
@_date: 2017-10-25 13:41:36
How so? It even says the value is $400? Is Tether NOT used at all anymore or something?
@_date: 2017-10-25 13:45:40
Sorry for the noob questions I never cared to learn about USDT. So is the value ALWAYS exactly 1$? Why is its purpose to be $1 aswell,
@_date: 2017-10-25 13:49:15
Ah! I see, thanks, I appreciate you.
@_date: 2017-10-28 14:42:34
Wow, you’re some kinda dumbass aren’t ya? Dude people do this daily... get with the times lmao don’t feel stupid because you haven’t caught up. I doubled my stack of Adex in a couple days and I have proof of trade history in Bittrex. You really do sound like an idiot lol
@_date: 2017-10-28 14:56:26
Oh is there not risk involved in holding as opposed to day trading? Everything works until it doesn’t, I hold my btc always, but I trade alts all the time, i’ve seen much more gain trading them lately than I have holding them. I’ll take my chances. And if I lose a few so what, I’m trading no more than $500 at a time, so even if i’m late to pull out when it plummets, so what, I lose maybe $100 at worst. I’m armed with Alarms and notifications always running and buy and sell orders set. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 10:55:04
I can't believe you're the first one to say that lmao Expected that to be top comment. Came to say it myself
@_date: 2017-10-28 13:51:06
Or daytrade it :) seriously, with its volatility you can turn 0.1 BTC into .5 in a day! (Theres videos where people do 0.1 to 1.0 but I can’t see that happening.....)
@_date: 2017-10-29 01:28:17
Hilarious you should do stand up
@_date: 2017-10-28 15:00:38
I agree
@_date: 2017-10-28 14:27:30
Awesome! What amount did you start trading with to profit 0.1? I’ve been experimenting and I double a stack of 300 Adex in 2 days! ( u/supermari0 ) I saw your deleted comment! So what? Lol
@_date: 2017-10-30 14:06:16
Literally his only other post. His account is like brand new. And if you look in the comments on his other post, you see he re wrote it and at the bottom he says “If you’d like to support me, here is my btc donation address ��”. Just doesn’t sound like a multimillionaire to me
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:20:57
Lol plagiarized!!!
@_date: 2017-10-28 16:15:45
Lol now this reply I like
@_date: 2017-10-25 03:21:18
This account is worth less than $500? He has $100000 TETHER not USD
@_date: 2017-10-28 14:52:28
How are you gonna quote me on something i’ve never wrote lol You’re a fool. Adex hasn’t gone down or up more than 10% in the last 3 days, im literally trading the usual volatility. Why dont you go ask for more help with your homework on REDDIT you child.
@_date: 2018-07-02 20:19:06
I hate Sammy replies
@_date: 2017-10-30 03:25:53
Smart kid. Befriend him, he will be big one day
@_date: 2017-10-28 15:32:21
Its funny how you guys act like there is no risk in crypto? Silly, unless a coin is discussed hard or has upcoming releases or news its going to maintain a normal route of volatility it take, along with its general downtrend or uptrend. Call it whatever you want, i’ve turned this into that and profited incredibly, most own crypto to hold, wait, and earn profit, but because i’m getting there faster with a tiny bit more risk, you holders lose your mind and shout fallacy lol
@_date: 2017-10-30 13:52:44
More info please, pics will help, doesn’t seem %100 believable. If you had over 2mil in btc I feel like you wouldn’t put your wallet address up and be asking for minuscule tips
