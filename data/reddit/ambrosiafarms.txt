Website doesn't seem to work after inputting postage data. It's also a wordpress site. Is that secure? Who processes your btc transactions? 
@_date: 2016-08-26 12:43:40
Sorry, but how is this different from a free paper wallet that you can generate yourself offline? How do we know somebody isn't MITMing the server that moves the keys around? Its also not very secure to keep reusing the same address over and over, isn't it? That's why HD wallets are a thing. 
@_date: 2016-08-29 23:24:13
Uh this is crypto genius right here. 
@_date: 2016-04-10 15:47:29
Since it's unlikely that the owners will attempt to seek out these lost btc, why don't you pull a Robin Hood and redistribute small amounts on to increase user adoption? Kind of like a faucet, but instead of some random website, it could be a place where bitcoin newbies come to learn more and get involved more. That would be very altruistic.

So is this kinda like a group of devs trolling the big banks? 50mil is a whole lot to basically take open source software and slap a fancy name on it. Do the bankers just want to be involved with the new digital currency trend so much that they'll just throw a bunch of money for research testing and product development? It's very confusing trying to
 think of what the banks think they can actually DO with the software.

What's blatantly clear from reading the comments on this ELI5 is that the vast majority are too stupid to understand that a cryptographically secured voting system would be objectively better than what we are doing now. The problem is that they don't know it exists, so they can't ask for it, they just continue using what's given. I would give it a couple decades and maybe a couple voting scandals to convince the public there needs to be a new system in place.
@_date: 2016-04-06 14:34:16
So you need a quantum computer to mint quantum bitcoins?
@_date: 2016-04-06 14:59:37
Very interesting, so how would you go about preparing quantum states that correspond with premined bitcoins?

Why is paypal in that video? Paypal doesn't accept bitcoin, they actively close accounts related to btc use. Nice video otherwise, but really? Check your facts. 
@_date: 2016-04-06 14:39:55
Seems potentially superior to bitcoin. But I do see the requirement that quantum computers are a commonplace for this to happen. Or maybe I'm wrong...
@_date: 2017-02-21 18:27:57
The answer is no. Research more about btc, it is international. A new asset class. 
@_date: 2017-02-21 18:14:14

Your question is irrelevant, he is not here to discuss the divide between core/classic and block size.
He is here to introduce a new idea that integrates bitcoin with the idea of universal basic income. I think his idea is genius! We need more development in this area. It allows our global society to implement UBI without relying on governments to come up with a terribly bureaucratic, ineffective  solution.
@_date: 2016-03-06 21:59:39
Uh what? Come back to reality buddy. Nobody gets shot over tax dollars.
@_date: 2017-02-19 02:40:27
Bitcoin is all about being your own bank. Get a hardware wallet for long term holding, it's the only sure way. It's the ultimate protection for your wealth. But this means you need to control the keys. If you're using an exchange to hold, your missing out on Bitcoin features like censorship resistance and antifragility. You can't predict the future, but you can put effort into preserving and protecting your keys. Take the responsibility in your own hands, it's a crazy world out there. Trust is dwindling in these times.

Great more centralized bank bullshit. Move along. Be your own bank. 
@_date: 2017-02-14 03:36:13
If this works it'll be huge, right? Like the killer app for cryptocurrencies and etfs, but not fiat, correct? 
Still seems a little magical and too good to believe.
 
In this system, No spread=lower volatility, what are the implications of this? Isn't this the opposite of how markets operate? Does this mean price discovery will continue to happen on existing markets?
So using this system I could buy into an etf with btc or eth or another etf, all using smart contract magic and BETs(bancor enabled tokens)? How or why do BGTs(Bangor Genesis tokens) fit into this? 
Laymans tl;du?

BOA is like the McDonald's of banks dude, what do you expect?
Although I must say I do love the 40$ overdraft fee that my bank applies by settling deposits and withdrawals in a way that only benefits them.

Curious as well. Can people find out which nodes are smaller and target them? DDoS attack? What else could happen?
@_date: 2016-03-07 05:33:31
Boycott PayPal. They will freeze your funds for no reason. Find an exchange.

Doesn't it seem inevitable in the near future, as solar/alt energy sources replace petro, that the US petrodollar monopoly will be overtaken by one or more other currencies?
I agree it does seem like hyperinflation will be one of the results. This process is going to take decades though.

I was poor before btc too. Staying in fiat makes it impossible to save money. Bitcoin is a great way to start a "savings account" that will constantly grow in value and protect your earnings against inflation. Stop thinking like a consumer and you'll actually be able to climb out of poverty with btc. It's going to take a long time but the other option is working until you die with no possibility for retirement. 
@_date: 2016-03-06 22:19:52
Great read. Many people miss the bigger picture of bitcoin. And that's OK, because it's still a baby as far as adoption goes. But it's unstoppable. So the true utility of btc will reveal itself as people continue to get fucked by big banks and big govs.

One of the features of bitcoin is that it's not seizable if you take proper precautions. You should never have told her what you were holding and how much it was worth. They should've been in cold storage on a hardware wallet. You done fucked up, but I guess getting married was the first fuck up.

mycelium still hasn't implemented segwit, which is why fees are so high. 
I just switched from mycelium to samourai wallet (active development team focused on privacy and new features) and the fee to send a transaction was like 0.02usd. The address will start with a 3 if it's a segwit address. It's worth switching to a more up to date wallet if only to save on fees. I think Bread wallet has also implemented segwit but you'll have to double check

Do NOT trade with a redditor, they'll take your coin and run. Use a service that has escrow like localbitcoin. That way you can get your escrow back if they don't make the deposit.
Fuck these guys for trying to take advantage of you. 
2 days? What are you talking about? 
Sell bitcoin: Payment method: Cash deposit
Find reputable trader with the best deal that deposits into your bank (major banks are most common)
Deposit bitcoin, Start trade, provide bank acct  bank name, and account holder name. They'll deposit cash into the account and it'll be available immediately. Make sure to do this during bank business hours and you'll have the money same day.
