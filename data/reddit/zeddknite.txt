Thought this would convince me this isn't all my construct, huh? Going to have to do better than that!

I was thinking maybe matter could be created, if energy is some kind of an "inverse reflection" of energy from another physical dimension. Like a two way splash on a dimensional plane, each side having equal and opposite energy values, always totalling zero. Energy could be created, from the perspective of either side, but only by disturbing a reflection plane between them.
A flat mirror surface is easiest to picture, but I imagine the dimensional plane to be spherical in nature. More specifically a point. The energy we observe being an outwards physical reflection of an "inwards" inverse dimension. I imagine the the perspective from the "inside" is similar to ours. It would be from outside a point, looking in. Not that everything is perfectly mirrored, just the initial energy that was created.
This could almost explain the big bang that created our universe. Given an initial state of a small vibration across a reflection plane point, chain reactions of statistical clustering could eventually cause enough of a perturbance to create a whole universe, with zero additional energy input, given that an inverse "splash" is created as well. 
So instead of trying to explain an infinitely dense point containing all matter in the universe, we just need to explain what caused the tiny ripple that started everything off. I'd like to think that some type of ancient being started that ripple, and that someday something will start another one, so existence can continue longer than this universe will last.
Anyways I saw Bitcoin was down and found this sub to see what was going on, and see if everyone was handling it well. Glad to see everyone is happy to have a buy opportunity!
TLDR; I found this sub to see how you hodlrs were weathering the drop, glad everyone's happy for a discount!
