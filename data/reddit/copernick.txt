What about closing one of the channels? How it looks like on blockchain?
To close two channels do we need to create two transactions? 
Are closing and opening transaction bigger than for the standard channel?

It is not the same. You can backup bitcoin keys even on the paper. Making backup of the state of the lightning channel is not recommended.

Illegal slot machines? I'm not sure, but usually the colorful "24h" sign means they are illegal gaming machines. They'll let you come in when they know you, or you look like an addicted client (you are observed through camera).
Hmm... I'm not sure, there are small number of colours used. Maybe something "under construction".

When I try to send Gdax\-\&gt;bc1, then an error/info appears that funds were send to Coinbase, and I should try again, but using Coinbase not GDAX. Strange "**Please enter a valid email or Bitcoin address \- The funds were transferred to Coinbase for processing, but failed to withdraw to ​​bc1q... . Please manually withdraw from Coinbase."**
