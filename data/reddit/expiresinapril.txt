Like ~7 BTC. Then ramp up to the full amount later once you get to know them.
@_date: 2017-02-19 12:27:19


So is $5. It depends entirely on the location, and the craziness of the people involved.


Completely subjective.
@_date: 2017-02-18 23:07:53


That's absoutely disgusting.
Caging people for victimless crimes, I mean.

@_date: 2017-02-19 12:28:26
Just saying, if you want to be making trades of ~70 BTC, better to 'start out small', rather than arrange a 70 BTC trade straight up.
Plus, 'dangerous amount' varies widely depending on the country - no way I'd do a $7000 cash trade in the US or Nigeria, but not much fear doing that in Aus or NZ. Less danger here.

Then it would STILL be an irrelevant fact with respect to OP's post.

Under this definition, most western goverments could be labelled as such, because 'target' might not be as obvious as guns and direct weapons, but just as an example, if the US government somehow gave a pamphlet about democracy to a North Korean civilian, or let an Iraqi girl see advertisements for bikinis, that could be classed as "targeting civilians", depending on the bias of who's making the classification.

No thank you - it's currently worth $2.8m - I'd rather spend my whole life trying to figure it out myself than risk a stranger taking the lot. Maybe I'll have a bout of reverse dementia in my 60's and suddenly become a 'billionaire'.

Having low decimal precision can create inaccuracy though (if rounding of a 'correct' value occurs or truncation of anything other than zeros).
@_date: 2017-01-14 10:39:44
If anyone actually types **aud btc** into duckduckgo, they'll see how OP very purposefully cropped out where duckduckgo has better decimal accuracy.

I don't remember who originally made it. I was just trawling through old hard drives and found the imgur link in some old 'bookmarks.html'.

By the way, this is exactly the same price as DigitalOcean. Except Vultr doesn't have a 200gb option - they jump straight from 100 ($10/mo) to 250 ($25/mo).

What is civilized about wearing shoes indoors? For all of Western societies' 'advancement', we still walk around indoors with our shoes on.
@_date: 2017-01-15 23:31:51
Yeah, but the 'good guy' in that story has long since left the company.
@_date: 2017-01-04 02:43:42


Sure, and as soon as I have some money I'll do that. I've been stuck for almost 3 years in a terrible terrible down cycle of desperation and late bills/rent. Highly skilled in Laravel 5.3 though, so if anyone has work for me that'd be great...

That argument could just as easily apply to wearing shoes indoors though - ridiculous and unnecessary.

You sound like you have a classic case of "My culture is the only non-ridiculous culture, and all other culture's customs are unnecessary."
Why don't you just keep wearing your shoes when you get home? Maybe walk on your bed and pillows too? Taking them off is 'unnecessary'.

It doesn't bother me that you're doing that. Indeed, it's exactly what I'm currently doing. Part of that for me is avoiding overly law-abiding exchanges that would readily give up customer data to authorities.
@_date: 2016-11-29 09:53:42
Which FAQ?
@_date: 2016-11-18 21:50:03
The problem I see with the proposal is calling *any* sign the 'real' one:


people because it is an existing Unicode character. [49] However, it does not resemble **the** bitcoin sign,
so it would require a major effort to switch to it.
These alternatives are workarounds due to the lack of **the real bitcoin sign** in Unicode.
No bitcoin sign is any more real than another. The preceding paragraph is a poor argument imho. One does not need to switch anything, if they just use Ƀ LATIN CAPITAL LETTER B WITH STROKE in their html and graphics in the first place.
In that sense, I don't see Ƀ as a 'workaround' to the one being proposed, any more than I see the one being proposed as a 'workaround' to Ƀ.

The amount, $3.74, is completely irrelevant though. A similar transaction for $3.74m, would have also cost 23 cents.

I understand your argument perfectly. I also understand that you're implying using lawful exchanges with all their KYC/AML requirements is a better idea than using exchanges such as btc-e.com.
