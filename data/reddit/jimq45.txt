Wait, if Paypal or Venmo switched there DBs to Blockchains - what the hell would be the difference? Genuine question.

Hope you’re using that $10 to buy a couple lottery tickets - much better investment.

Great question! Honestly, I shorted BTC when the rhetoric was at its height, which happened to be around 16k and made a fortune. I am waiting to see when that happens again or when the despair sets in - may even go long a bit then.
So due diligence/seeing where the public is at etc.

Actually investing in the government is what is referred to as ‘risk free’ - i.e. risk free rate. 
So umm,  nope.  It’s arguably best and definitely safest.

Na. you’re right - instead I’ll find something that will lose 65-70% in few months. You guys would be in the best position to show me how ����

Blockchain technology doesn’t add anything  - unless you completely distrust banks - and at that point why have them at all - to have an institution to blame? If you want fiat and banks - forget crypto and forget blockchain - let’s end this bubble already.

Futures - shorted bitcoin

Wait I thought crypto eliminated the need for trust...that’s why we don’t need intermediaries like banks. Not true?

Whoa whoa whoa - I thought bitcoin was going to revolutionize privacy in transactions! Why can’t I use Citibank instead of Coinbase - I mean if I have to verify myself - what is the difference. How dare they!!
Right! Right! Come on Bitfreaks let’s boycott. They are infringing on our civil rights!

Put that money in 529 fund, Buy her a few shares of SPY and APPL (backed by Companies actually generating cash flow) - at least she will have a few dollars for textbooks and not just a souvenir.

You know it doesn’t restart right - unless your talking about the market/economy as a whole, certainty not for an ‘asset’ with no cash flow.

Think maybe he’s trying to teach everyone a lesson - like wake up and realize crypto is bullshit if a bank can create a coin out of thin air - a big, bad BANK. Haha
I mean Jamie’s got a little more wit then I do - so he’ll just show you how ridiculous this is.

Mobira? Not sure that lasted very long. Cell phones definitely, Mobira, not at all. HODL Bitcoin! Right? Hahaha

Now I get it. You people fall for everything.
@_date: 2018-02-04 18:38:02
I haven’t been anywhere where I can spend my bitcoin (brick and mortar). I mean even online it’s difficult. So when will I be able to pay for my slice of pizza at my local spot that doesn’t even accept credit cards. When will most places except crypto? Why don’t they accept it now? Which crypto will they accept?
Your making a point about 4 years ago but why haven’t we progressed in leaps and bounds if this happened 4 years ago?
@_date: 2018-07-13 05:42:12
Wow Slovakia we are reaching.
Whoa a bank did this? I thought BTC was supposed to eliminate banks?
What’s happening? Should I put my last $2437 into Bitcoin because of this - does this mean i will get the $52,000 I had at 20k per back? I had so much money then and now I can’t eat. 
Please help.

Not pizza back fiat - I want to buy a pizza with bitcoin (that doesn’t make the news) - come on man you know what I mean. I didn’t look at the link but I know my local shop don’t take bitcoin that’s for sure. 
And really that’s all that matters. When bitcoin is used in everyday transactions - then talk to me. 
Edit: real ? - explain to me why bitcoin should be worth more than ETH or any of the 100 other coins? Blockchain is cool and will have wide ranging applications - don’t confuse the two.
@_date: 2018-04-06 21:00:48
But no one does and that’s why you people need to all move on. Bitcoin is nothing - just like fiat is paper, except the government backs my dollars so it has value when I want a slice of pizza. What don’t people get?
@_date: 2018-04-30 18:40:32
Just shorted another 10k - never would have seen this in the U.S. Thank you!
@_date: 2018-12-16 10:07:13
No no no...bitcoin is. Get rid of it and you’ll have a better market.
