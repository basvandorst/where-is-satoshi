Just selling it with bitcoin is highly impractical if we are talking about streaming.
If what you say is true no blockchain could work. I'm not knowledgable enough to argue against you, but how are the electricity grid solution suppose to work if there is no way for external data to be registered?
The token would not be traded for a song, but rather accredited to the producer with each stream.

No, you are right. Thats what I meant. 
My point is that this goes against your opinion that blockchains are only useful if there is a need to protect data from manipulation. Maybe I'm missing the point of your post.

What about the classic case of eliminating the middlemen? 
Spotify doesn't necessarily change any data, but I still see them as an unnecessary barrier between me as a consumer and the musician as a producer.
Spotify is essentially handling the payment and distribution between two unknown parties. This could be handled by a blockchain in the future and either reduce the cost for the consumer or raise the revenue for the producer.
Same applies to Uber, Airbnb and Ebay.
Any thoughts on that? Please correct me if my line of thinking is wrong.

No not in bitcoin, but voise is trying to be a blockchain solution for music streaming.

Can someone explain to me why it took until 2008 for a system like blockchain to emerge? I realize that it was a stroke of genius in both computer technology and economics, but somehow it seems as if it could have also occurred in the two decades of internet development prior. 
Am I missing something trivial like bandwidth and storage capacity becoming cheap enough for a system like this to become sustainable?

Just curios: how low does the volatility have to be for the bitcoin price to be seen as stable?
