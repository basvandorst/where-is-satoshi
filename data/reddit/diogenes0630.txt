So you’re investing in bitcoin and not a single Altcoin? Just wondering
@_date: 2018-05-22 14:47:17
Yeah I’m not taking that advice. Bitcoin isn’t the only crypto that will succeed. If you believe that you will get REKTTTT. Even Richard heart said it.

The term “Decentralization’’can be used in many ways. Although I was misinformed that the decentralization behind bitcoin was different from what I thought.
@_date: 2018-05-10 23:40:03
That is very true. The rich and the poor will forever exist in our world. But the wealth distribution is all types of fucked up. 1% of the the worlds richest own 50% of all global wealth. How in the fuck is that even reasonable?
@_date: 2018-05-10 23:23:02
So the technology behind Bitcoin is decentralized but the wealth distribution isn’t? That means Bitcoin mirrors the dollar in a sense.
@_date: 2018-05-10 22:34:54
This is concerning me. I want Bitcoin to succeed but how is it decentralized when so many are owned by very few people?
@_date: 2018-05-11 00:30:21
Thanks for that. That was good to hear. I hope the best for the future!
@_date: 2018-05-12 15:35:58
How so, I’m not disagreeing with you I’m just wondering.
@_date: 2018-05-10 22:56:20
How am I trolling
@_date: 2018-05-11 00:10:02
Exactly. Decentralized wealth will never happen I guess.

An article on Telegram, if these numbers are incorrect please tell me the correct ones
@_date: 2018-05-22 15:08:24
You’re right the market shot up way too much 
@_date: 2018-05-10 23:49:33
The wealth distribution in crypto currency is not decentralized at all. Nobody gives a shit about decentralized tech. They care about decentralization of wealth.

Coinbase has the worst customer service of all time. Period. Just wait it out. They didn’t let my access my Litecoin for 3 months.
@_date: 2018-05-22 13:36:05
Love your sarcasm
@_date: 2018-06-10 16:56:44
Then why not use the money you already have? Not the banks money?
@_date: 2018-06-10 23:39:51
This is me every week.
@_date: 2018-06-13 18:26:04
Btw the emoticons were to immitate moon boys and the crypto community. Don’t take it so literal next time
@_date: 2018-06-13 15:53:06
I’m not asking Reddit to give me belief on my investment. For all you guys know, I’m investing in TittyCoin or Bitconnect ( I’m not). I’m simply asking is it worth putting more money into this bear market cuz it’s like I’m feeding my money into a wood chipper. Don’t take offense to it. Jesus 
@_date: 2018-06-05 14:50:01
Trust me I was lmao
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:41:56
I hope so
@_date: 2018-06-13 20:14:48
I agree man. It’s disturbing honestly. I’m not trying to argue with anyone. No one has to have the same opinion either. I lost my cool cuz of how rude these people are.
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:02:40
You’re responding to me like female. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 15:59:58
I agree. I’m fine with t being in a bear market. I’ve learned never to listen to idiots on twitter or YouTube.
@_date: 2018-06-13 21:27:57
Thanks man!
@_date: 2018-06-10 21:20:03
You’re the type to invest in bitconnect
@_date: 2018-06-10 17:17:59
Yeah not mad you took that risk. Just mad that someone might take that as a great idea and do the same shit thinking it’ll work out for them too lol
@_date: 2018-06-13 18:12:09
Lol look in the mirror for once dude.
@_date: 2018-06-10 21:12:45
Instant liquidity? You know how fucking long it takes to get rewards points.
@_date: 2018-06-10 17:03:51
That’s not a good way to build credit. They’re 100 better ways to build credit. That’s a dumb decision. If you’re gonna buy crypto, buy with your own money. Cuz if shit hits the fan, you just landed yourself into a deeper hole. Fuck with your own money, not the banks money. You’ll never win.
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:59:32
You called me a bitch or saying this community is cancerous. Which lets me know you’re clearly part of the cancer.
@_date: 2018-06-05 16:56:19
Prove it
@_date: 2018-06-10 16:57:24
I’m assuming you paid off the debt?
@_date: 2018-06-10 16:48:48
That’s cuz only an idiot would buy crypto with CREDIT card
@_date: 2018-06-14 00:35:50
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-06-10 17:11:58
That’s great. I’m glad it was all worth it. I just hope no idiot in this thread will take this as advice and do the same. Cuz that’s a serious risk. Thankfully you didn’t get rekt.
@_date: 2018-06-13 15:50:25
I guess
