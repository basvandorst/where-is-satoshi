**whew** my BTC and USD are intact! I was a dumbass and left over 30BTC in my MtGox account.

you can buy some from individual traders on  using paypal. otherwise you need to either wire money or use a paypal alternative such as dwolla to get money to mtgox which is what I did but altogether it took 4 and a half days..

also [bitcoinhop](
has a nicer interface. I sold an ipod on there and everything went better than expected.

This sucks. I decided to invest about $1k when the silk road story broke and it was around $10. Unfortunately I decided to go through dwolla -&gt; mtgox which is taking FOREVER. I know I could've possibly gotten on irc and found someone to trade with via paypal but that is difficult without an established reputation; if there weren't so many hoops to jump through initially I could've tripled my money!

Of course. I just never imagined it being lucrative.. I assumed it was always people from Asia or what have you making a few dollars a day.

Negatory, still waiting on Dwolla. I can see that the funds have been withdrawn from my bank's site, but they are still listed as pending at Dwolla.

Yeah, they will have to implement a search as it gets more popular. I don't know of any bitcoin auction sites with many listings yet; that other site only has 12 listings as far as I can tell.
