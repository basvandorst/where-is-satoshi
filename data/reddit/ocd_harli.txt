How can you *not* focus on USD price? BTC doesnt exist just for the sake of BTC, it exists to be exchanged for other currency, goods or services. You have to take into account how much in other currency, goods or services fees cost. Or how much less bread can you buy by paying for BTC transaction. We *need* to assume that USD (or whatever currency) price of satoshi will just go up up up IF BTC is successful. BTC price of transfer is less relevant. Yes, you pay fees in BTC, but thats technical implementation, not a reference point. The only relevant metric is how much of a real world **value** is lost in a transaction fees. Real world value is real worlds reference point.

I know about one other manufacturer and lots of gossips. But, while manufacturing competition is good for all, it doesnt necessarily translate to actual mining decentralization. Its also so far away down the line to depend the future of the blockchain on such thing. I'm now going a bit offtopic, but my main gripe with future of bitcoin is that it wants to rely on positive forces around it - business to adopt segwit, business to adopt ln, users to want to use ln, manufacturers to keep a fair game, miners to not group up... Its a shaky proposition, and getting all outside factors in line will be a sloooow and tedious process.

Why I dont disagree, I'm not sure how's that relevant here. This discussion revolved around idea that Satoshi is dead, and whether or not (in that case) his coins are lost or someone else has the keys. Someone else meaning it doesnt matter if Satoshi planned to sell or hodl. While its quite possible Satoshi wouldnt sell a single BTC, its not that easy to conclude someone else, getting this fortune out of nowhere, would act the same.
@_date: 2017-02-22 09:35:59
Right, it is gaining a huge momentum. But even in such situation that is pretty much perfect for BTC, that's still 1,8m USD worth on the last tick. Outside localbitcoin, there are most definitely other channels used, but its still just a tiny percentage of population using BTC over there.
@_date: 2017-02-28 22:16:06
I would be really sad if BTC ends up only as a "digital gold". Fees - I dont mind *that* much, though of course less is better, but speed of transaction would be important to me.   
I dont buy "other solutions" until we're presented with actual, good, trustworthy, other solutions.  
Also, at that point it would be hard to argue its value. You cannot say BTC is worth XXX,XXX because people want it to simplify global trade with each other thus organically creating demand and liquid market, but rather its worth so and so for the sole reason hodlers believe its worth so and so.

Having said that, I'm also ready to buy the dip, but I still haven't really decided where to place the order. I dont think it'll half its value, it doesn't make sense; ETF rejection really isnt such a big deal.
@_date: 2017-02-26 01:50:14
I'm with you. Storing a bit differently  - each "paper" equals exactly 0,5BTC, single use, loaded to online wallet if needed, and keys actually hidden in plain sight. And "paper" in quotation marks as I'm not actually using paper. I made it interesting, and to be perfectly honest, if someone manages to see the signs and decrypt the puzzle, I wouldnt even be mad. :) 
I'd be much more nervous with a single electronic device storing all my BTC.
@_date: 2017-02-21 21:49:43
You seem to paint too much of a perfect picture, which is a red flag of bullshit to people that dont care enough to learn more. 
Also, sentences like "fiat currencies can be created out of thin air", while technically true, sound like conspiracy-theory-lizzard-people-shooting-chemtrails statement. Problems of fiat are not important to people that are there just for the money, and dont care about "making a world a fairer place". Fiat is here to stay anyway alongside the BTC, so there's no need to even start that debate.
People dont respond well to change that is exact opposite of the life they feel safe to lead. I tend to start with stuff like - its a highly volatile shit that can actually go to shit anytime, and list all the negative things that can happen to bitcoin. Now they feel safe, they understand **why** everyone and their mothers arent already invested in bitcoin. When they understand all the risks of bitcoin, I tell them about positive sides of the story. Story that is still simply wishful thinking, but has rather decent chance to become one of their best investments in life. Then they feel smart. They feel like they were smart to wait it out for BTC to "stabilize" and get acknowledged by governments and financial institutions, they kinda wish they started a bit sooner, and they feel superior to all the millions of others that are still behind them on this path to riches. 
Works well.

While what you're saying is true, its not *that* important at this point, and possibly will be changed in the future. Pure crypto exchanges will get recognised, and traditional fintech companies may, or may not, adopt BTC. Businesses will come along with more users.     
But on a more important note: being your own bank is one of the bitcoins most important selling points. Those that care about that stuff will value BTC, and use it for what it is, and welcome the fact that private keys are theirs to keep safe. Those that dont care about that stuff will use online wallets and layer2 solutions (that have yet to come). Eventually, there will be something like well known and recognized BTC paypal, or paypal itself will adopt BTC.
@_date: 2017-03-04 01:42:20
I'd argue that casual users / vast majority are on online wallets. But anyway, to put what I'm saying into some perspective - I completely agree that soft fork, when applicable, is preferable solution. But any way you spin it, both soft and hard forks have trade offs. I guess the only thing I disagree on is that maintaining backwards compatibility is such a paramount goal, no matter what. If developers come up with some amazing solution that should require hard fork, and users actually want it, then I'm all for it. If maintaining backwards compatibility adds enough complexity to become a big time sink for developers, then I'm all for planned breaking changes.
@_date: 2017-02-27 10:47:12
I kinda disagree. I'd reckon smaller business will either keep, or sell to themselves. But I disagree more with the statement that bitcoin has to grow in value at all to be used for trading. Market cap is nearly 19bUSD, while daily trading is in dozen of millions. Means billions are not bought to be used for trading, but rather as an investment, treating BTC as a commodity, inflating the price. Really, price can be 10 times lower and it'll be equally okay to use BTC as a currency.
The main reason BTC is not that good of a currency is that its expensive and slow to be used for daily purchases. Actual value of 1BTC is irrelevant.
@_date: 2017-03-06 01:28:24
You'll receive 1000$ in cash there and then (most have max limit in a single transaction, and it may be lower than 1000$). Well, after transfer goes through. You may want to find ATM inside a restaurant so you can eat something, grab a coffee and watch birds outside a window, while it confirms transaction. Fees depend on a company that placed ATM.
@_date: 2017-03-04 20:08:26
Should have done the other way around... Selling while price is pumped up like this, and buying after the decision seems like a much better choice:   
- If ETF gets denied and price plummets, you're in the profit, and can buy back all the coins at a great price (also helping BTC bounce back, as a side effect)   
- If ETF gets approved, rise is definite, and any time you buy back would be a good time to buy. Sure you'd miss couple of dozen USD in price, but thats a small price to pay for safe and informed decision with, as you say, "most of what you had".
Gambling with ETF decision is great and all if you written off those funds as gambling funds, OR plan not to touch any of it for a long while.

@_date: 2017-03-04 03:30:07


Definitely. But as much as I agree with that, its not very realistic to expect that from random joe, especially if we want bitcoin to be adopted by masses. Online wallets are convenient, there's next to no new knowledge required for users, and well lots of money likes to hang out on exchanges, providing liquidity to the market. People value convenience more than security or privacy, and even though many on this sub will say BTC is not for them, I think BTC should be welcoming to everyone, and online wallets serve their purpose in that regard.
@_date: 2017-02-28 22:05:47
Its mostly pointless to do so due to its high volatility. Having dynamically calculated price based on set price in fiat doesnt count.   
But it also doesn't matter as argument is flawed if you're comparing it to gold - no one prices anything in gold either.

They likely will, but at that points its just another virtual currency, not very different than simply forbidding cash usage of dollar or euro. Bitcoin has value not (just) because its virtual and crypto, but because its not: centralized, governed, inflationary, localized- everything your government currency will be.
@_date: 2017-03-03 12:41:57


Why? 
@_date: 2017-03-04 23:05:55
Merchants can have prices calculated in local fiat, but payable by bitcoin. Volatility is obviously bad, but that holds true for everyone using bitcoin, apart from traders. So a merchant, if worried about btc volatility, can always auto-convert to his local fiat value at the time of the sale. In that case, current price is irrelevant, only transaction time could be an issue.
@_date: 2017-02-11 19:57:58
Different interests, scaling issues, transaction speed and cost, different types of contracts etc etc. You're thinking just from an end consumer perspective, but having merchants grouped together, suppliers, chains of different industries, can all bootstrap new coin, and make it go public at any time with heavy infrastructure already in place. Compare that to BTC that stalled its progress because people just cant figure out the "right" way forward. I just wouldnt stake my house on BTC. I'm 1/1 sure cryptocurrencies are here to stay though.
@_date: 2017-03-06 22:58:46
Many already said they will support both chains.
@_date: 2017-03-03 23:34:58
Its pretty much normal state of affairs in the world. Progress happens, from real world laws, hardware industry, to silly software apps, breaking changes are natural and normal, and getting yourself rid of all the baggage from the past is a step forward.   
Since I know this reflects on the current scaling problem, I feel I need to put a disclaimer that I by no means support "the other side", but as a general rule, making progress slower, or non existent, due to the "backwards compatibility" and hurt feelings of conservatives that, and we simply just assume - "dont like the update", is plain dumb.
@_date: 2017-03-04 03:43:19


I love when I read these kind of sentences so casually thrown inside a comment. Makes me feel like everyone else is being paid in crypto, and I'm being a dumb fuck that *still* gets paid in fiat. Wanna go ask to be paid in btc.
@_date: 2017-03-03 12:59:00
Reason why it works is because we have inflationary currencies tied to the economy, and deflationary commodities as a side store of value. No matter what you read here and there, BTC is mostly used like gold, rather than as currency. Even here you'll read people discouraging others to actually spend their bitcoins, as holding is more profitable. So yes, it encourages hoarding and couldnt work as primary currency.
@_date: 2017-03-06 17:06:40
Absolutely agreed.  
I'm a bit of a pessimist regarding ETF, but this media attention, actual serious talks about BTC as a viable alternative, etc, are all great and important things that came out of it. Even if this ETF rule change proposal gets rejected, I'm still pretty confident that BTC can only go forward.

@_date: 2017-03-02 20:59:27
We'll see a dip soon... all things go up, until they no longer dont. Long term, BTC value is going up, but there's ETF rejection coming (sorry guys), and we'll all be better off preparing for it by having a cash ready to "buy the dip" and prevent it from crashing too low, then to be overly optimistic about something that has very low chance of actually happening.
You'll see a panic sell period in a short while. I suggest waiting at least till 11.3. before deciding to enter the market. After that, just keep it steady, and buy in small amounts as you can.

Timing the market involves trying to guess *when* something will happen (ergo word "timing"). For example your words "cash to throw at this just ahead of the ETF announcement" is in fact timing the market.   
I dont make that assumption in my last post, though its rather safe to say that ETF resolution will kick the price in some direction, depending on the news. But drop WILL happen. It has to. Even if ETF gets approved, it'll likely make BTC even more volatile for a while. Now reread my last comment, maybe it'll make more sense.

By just sitting back, BTC can sink so much it never gets back on its feet.
@_date: 2017-03-02 22:42:11
Honestly, the healthiest thing people here can do today is to stop buying, and maybe even consider selling some, and use the cash to buy the dip. It helps control volatility, and helps control the downfall WHEN it happens. Traders and people actually *using* BTC are the healthiest part of its ecosystem.    
Suggesting things like that leads to downvotes though and burying comments that even hint to the fact that mass buying at whatever price and hodling is maybe not the best strategy for bitcoin health; r/bitcoin is all about pumping the price up. I am honestly a bit worried about the next big drop. Sure, we'll likely end up on the positive side again, eventually, but every big drop is a big step back.

Hide keys in a plain sight. There are so many creative ways to have keys safe, without anyone figuring them out. I mean, you can reprint technical details of whichever electronics you have, store it with its warranty paper, with private key "hidden" among it, and not a single person will ever figure it out. Engrave it on a knife you dont actually use. Print a QR code on the bottom of a plant pot, and even if anyone ever turns it around, it'll think its production label. You can think of any amount of water/fire proof ideas, have them displayed anywhere, without anyone ever realizing they hold a key to fortune. 
On the other hand, everyone will steal a (mobile) safe, and try to figure out what that silly string does, and why its in a safe.

Bottom line, some are happy to risk and speculate, some arent, but everyone uses their bitcoins as they see fit. Money is here to serve our needs, not the other way around.
Good luck with the rest of the coins.

They are quite popular in the "eastern block" of EU.

I'm not sure what are you opposing to... Sure, list can be kept up to date as "it unfolds". Its healthy to be cautious, and yeah, most of my holdings are not on exchanges anyway. Still, for those coins there I'd like to keep online and ready to trade and spend, I'd like to know which exchanges actually published their stances.

True, but it would bring in a LOT of consumer grade hardware into the mix, including my GPU rig thats currently only profitable on altcoins. It would bring back the idea that every gamer out there could use its GPU to mine during idle hours.
Having said that, as much as I'd like to be able to mine BTC with my hardware, I think there's no going back, and changing the algorithm now would do a lot more harm than good.

Share the love about BTC to your countrymen. Your coins will be worth more if more people over there use it; so even if Erdogan makes a move against BTC, you could always trade BTC locally. Sadly, Turkey is going towards all the wrong places, and investment in BTC may very well be your smartest choice.

I'd love to get this going, which is why I replied to myself with news on GDAX, but hopefully others will chime in with their info. Thus a thread.

This is actually pretty cool!
