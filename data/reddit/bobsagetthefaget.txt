I'm an idiot for believing that if gdax had $1 billion in reserve last year, that Bitfinex which has been around longer, and has MORE volume in trades might have the same or more? Not to mention they have YEARS of fees? You are retarded. "No way." You have no basis for your claim.

Lemme ask you a simple question. COinbase made over a billion in revenue last year. Let's say net income was $500 million. Bitfinex has been around since 2013. You really don't think they have $2-3 billion saved up? You are an idiot.

Didn't say that at all. I think Bitfinex is sleazy as fuck, and absolutely committing all sorts of fraud. If anything I'd suspect they're running a partial fractional reserve. I do believe however they have the cash reserves of $1-3 billion or something of that like. The amount of revenue they pull in, and company net worth has to be high enough to cover anywhere from 10-100% of this over the years.

It's nice but you really need to just have one command to show both USD and Satoshi value in one command. There's no need to have two commands which is annoying. Can you fix this?

Oh, so it's a British thing? What if you're in the states?

Once that's installed also add JSON Helper : 
After those two are installed, use better touch tool to create a new touch bar widget and set its behaviour to run an Apple script every 10 seconds.
Use Apple script  This will display the ETH price, from here you can style the widget however you would like.
If you want BTC you just change the url from ETH to BTC.
But this script does not support Monero.

Is your heatmap showing daily or hourly volatility? Chart isn't clear on that. Also is there a widget that can be used? Also can we get 30 day, 60 day alt volatility data as well? similar to:  There is no other website that does that in heatmap – it would be greatly appreciated :D This would make it easier to figure out which coins on longer time periods are more volatile than others!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
