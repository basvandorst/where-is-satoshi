What are YOUR predictions for bitcoin over the next year? I would guess at $1000 a month it would take you 6-18 months at the most.
Edit: Going to feel bad if you have cancer

US must not have as many weak hands

The futures market of BTC might try and inflate the price leading up to the end of the first contracts, where if they are able to manipulate it and bring the price down, whoever shorted bitcoin will make 10x on their money. I see huge incentive for big players to try and do this. I don't see that sustaining itself, but for the first month I would be surprised if it didn't happen. If it ever goes below 10k again that is when it'll happen

They are gone
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:56:23
Why would anyone do that?

What extra $10?
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:06:28
I haven't seen it go up $100-200 a minute since it hit 10k and went straight to 11. I'm guessing we'll see high 12's today and end the day around 11,4

$11,750 now. Something is happening guys!

You cannot sell on Coinbase in Canada. You would have to transfer it to another exchange first or set up deals with individuals on LocalBitcoin. If you do the latter you can charge 10-15% on top of current price for direct deposit into your bank account. Also watch the price of bitcoin when you make a buy on Coinbase. If it's trading at 10000 they will charge you 10400 for it on top of fee's and also charge you fees when you go to withdraw it. If you can set up an account on GDAX you can avoid this, but the buys are not instant

Read up on the lightning network. It should roll out early next year.

You have to remember to a jump from 2000-3000 is a 50% increase, 4000-6000 is a 50% increase, 6000-9000 is a 50% increase. 9000-10000 is only 11%. I wouldn't expect to see a correction unless it went from 9000 to 13500 in the same time it went up by this 10%. Even still it might only come back to 10-12k after that.
When bitcoin is 100k a 10% jump like this will increase the price by $10,000 per coin. That might happen in just a few days in the future. Now that it's high $100 up or down is less than 1%

The same thing happened to me. I didn't get an email but my weekly limit is at $0. Normally it goes up $X in an hour and it's been 0 for a while now. :( Damnit Coinbase, as if the fees didn't make them bad enough

My order just went through. And the exchange is bullshit. Make sure you keep your coins off of it in your own wallet. Other then that I've just been trying to time these dips to cover Coinbase fees, in the long term I'm still ahead - but damn those fees

At midnight they said they would he done their maintainence at 1am. It's now 5am and I am still unable to buy. I am trying so hard to be patient, but not being able to buy dips and only buying at aths is killing my enthuasm
@_date: 2017-11-30 11:58:35
Canada. Ive tried to sign up for at least 4 exchanges and I wasn't able to verify my identity on anything but Coinbase. I might try LBC but I really loved buying the coins instantly during dips like this
