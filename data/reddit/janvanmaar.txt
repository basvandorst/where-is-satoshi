However, as far as I know, Bitsquare does not provide any protection against the issue of fiat chargebacks (limiting the amount of such trades just limits the losses, not providing a real protection).  I stopped selling BTC for fiat at LocalBitcoins after losing BTC due to such a chargeback issued a month after the transaction - thus not only losing the BTC with practically no way to get it back but also having to explain the transaction to the bank etc.  And there was no reason to suspect the buyer as he has had a history of quite a few successful transactions spanning through several months...  
In fact, it may be even worse with Bitsquare unless it requires ID's for fiat transactions similarly to Localbitcoins. So, Bitsquare looks promising for decentralized coin trading but for fiat trading I would rather use an established trustworthy partner/company.

yeah, sure.  I have tried it the other way around (selling) and got a message from you that I can sell you BTC for at most 2.62 EUR.   Thank you very much for your "service" but I rather buy a beer for those 2 euros and do my change elsewhere...  A pity as it looked like a good service on paper.

I can confirm that it has worked nicely after the fix!  Slightly cumbersome account creation (having to set and immediately reset the password and activate 2FA just for a single purchase) but otherwise quite good, also qua fees/rate.  Will keep using BitPanda.

"Unfortunately our available Stock is too low for your order. We adjusted the Amount to the Maximum we can process right now."
And the BTC equivalent is 0.0022.
Forgot to mention it was with an option to Amazon.de (if that makes any difference)

OK - glad to hear that it was actually just a glitch!  Will give it another go later.

Apparently it was a temporary Kraken issue, it is fixed now.

A strange issue here:  I have just withdrawn fiat (no problems with that), however even after several tens of attempts, coin deposits do not show the deposit address.  I always only see: "By depositing, I acknowledge that Kraken is not responsible for any coins sent to the wrong address. "  and after clicking "Yes, I acknowledge",  the same page just reloads with the same message.  The same for all the coins.  Is this a bug or are all coin deposits disabled?

Things which everyone supports are, by definition, not issues.

But that is not the way it should be...  The tickets should be just looked into and answered within the advertized time (24-48 hours), without a need for someone pushing those complaining at reddit discussions.  Of course it may happen that occasionally it takes longer, but 21 days as the OP and still nothing???  And it seems to be a rule rather than exception: I am myself having a ticket open for 7 days with no answer.  
Having experienced the breakdown and lost coins at cryptsy &amp; mintpal, I am very suspicious of these sorts of things...  my first thought always is: why would Kraken not be able to hire more people for support if they were doing well?  Of course I hope it's not that bad but one never knows.

I can confirm that after the PM, the Kraken support has solved my ticket promptly and professionally, even on Saturday evening.  I am glad to hear that new support staff is being hired and I certainly hope that things will settle and Kraken will rule again!

But are there any Segwit transactions in the LTC blockchain?  Many people question that.  If not (?), then it only means that Segwit does not break the usual non-Segwit functionality but it is still unclear whether the Segwit functionality itself works as expected.
