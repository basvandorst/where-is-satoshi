Hmmm I haven’t checked the textbook definition of a bubble, but I’d probably disagree. I know how they occur, and btc has a very high chance of being in a bubble due to its valuation. I’m not predicting a crash (otherwise I’d be arguing that it’s *definitely* in a bubble, since a crash should be required by definition) but it’s definitely overvalued.
Don’t get me wrong, there are a lot of things pushing this thing up and I could go on forever, but just so I respond to your question, I’ll stop myself there lol.

Definitely. However bitcoin prices are still psychological (I feel like people aren’t really doing the math with btc), so the $1k markers still might cause some kind of reaction. But for sure, every $1k gets easier and easier.

This is humorous, but continuing with the example:
For all the people who don’t care to take out their own trash, will you do it for them *for no compensation at all, simply because it’s the right thing to do*? Are there enough of your type of people to do that for everyone in the country? Would you go long distances, through rain and snow and heat, to do that for multiple houses and apartment complexes? Furthermore, it would be at the *cost* of missing out on literally anything else you could be doing at the time!

You’re being sarcastic but it’s true unfortunately

Totally agree that btc is scarce and can be adopted, leading to its stability. But it’s not bubble-proof right now.
Adoption is definitely the key for bitcoin to become bubble-resistant, but it’s not yet guaranteed (I’m def optimistic about it).
I.e. Stocks are scarce and “adopted”. That didn’t stop them from becoming overvalued during the dot com bubble. It’s not the same overall story with btc obviously, but it breaks your rules. The main culprit during a bubble is still valuation.
I enjoy a good discussion :)

It would be great for everyone to do good on their own, but that’s not how large civilizations work. There will always be people who work for money only.
In an ideal world, garbage men would do what they do just because it’s a necessity. In reality, they do it because taking out other peoples’ trash is a job that pays.
The previous generation **taught** us that you need money to survive. And that single lesson has been turned upside down. This could be a really good thing.

Referring to “shorting alone can’t force an asset to decline”
Do you mind explaining this for me? I’m really curious. Thanks!

Perfect meme. Screw all the people that don’t get it!

Makes sense. This is the only way to retroactively record/take your money (especially after the run this year, you bet your ass they’re gonna try). Can’t run from Uncle Sam.
Best of luck.
PS I didn’t think my phone would autocapitalize Uncle Sam. Fuck that guy.

Hmm please explain?
Edit: Prices ARE valuations, so I’m super curious.

Stocks. The fees I’ve seen so far are percentage-based for bitcoin, as opposed to flat rate/free for stocks.

We got off the gold standard long ago, and bitcoin brings us back to “perfect scarcity”.

Bitcoin is revolutionary like the invention of the cell phone is revolutionary. We just haven’t gotten the “iPhone” yet, meaning another coin that will be “widespread” on top of “revolutionary”.

Anyone who thinks btc has no reason to fail is ignoring all the possible reasons out there for it to fail. I’m bullish on bitcoin, but seriously. Anything could happen. Ignoring that fact right there is certainly irrational.

Are there different tax implications?

Yes I understand that. But just saying the Monopoly money analogy doesn’t work. That’s what they said when the dollar went off the gold standard.
@_date: 2018-12-07 14:29:06
When people say BTC is Monopoly money, but they use USD... ���� the difference is government backs the USD, and science and mathematics back BTC. USD can get manipulated, but BTC don’t play.
Not saying I super support one over the other, just observations
