This should be the only thing that matters. I'm waiting for trezor's new device that will support more currencies.

I happened to transfer all of my Mt. Gox balance elsewhere on 1/31, just a week before they stopped transfers. It was less than 1 btc, but I'm glad I still have it.

You literally said that a $500 investment would net you 1.25 million. I'm just asking when in 2011. When I bought my first coins I bought at $13. So if I held, I wouldn't have a million.
I sold happy at 200. Then cried when it hit 1000 a week later.

In July of 2011 the price was $13, so $500 wouldn't have made you a million. Maybe earlier or later in the year?

I was a customer of both ruxum and tradehill. I wonder if I left coins at either of those exchanges. 
Back then dwolla was the best way to buy. Dwolla to mt gox.

You get guaranteed a buy price, regardless what it does 5 days later.
