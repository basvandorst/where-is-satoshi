not attacking you but that right there is fucking merkle root of the bullshit stories segwit is the quickest way to increase size. reasonable minds can argue about alternatives but to go lie about 1mb is just not going to work now. its only sequence segwit first HF later. lying and ad hominem attacking people must stop from u/gavinandresen downwards
there is only one single tech person who thinks 28days is not insane and that is gavin who is in jerk mode himself and sowing it to ceos and he has lost the tech plot since foundation imploded. plot  ceos are saying angry stuff on twitter medium and they are people who gavin works with. hate ate gavins brain and it is infectious.

i will be polite but cant guarantee others. it would be horribly ironic and leave no venue for discussion of the largest dispute and debate hurting bitcoins existance as r/btc is downvoting it.

users dont understand schnorr as much as they dont understand dsa! the point is the transactions are 1/2 the size so you can get 2x as many transactions in a 2MB block etc. that doesnt take genius to understand.

we can disagree about the order of doing HF first vs second and i share your view, but to say core is holding bitcoin back intentionally is nonsense. those guys were coding as volunteers for &gt; 4 years and are bitcoin holders. 
blockstream i mean they hold bitcoin to? sidechains work on bitcoin. why would they hold bitcoin back?

the forum is not people who want bitcoin to tail, though you could argue making false stories and organized ad hominem does that.
but the forum is also people who dislike censorship (of classic on this forum) and some normal bitcoin users and ceos and some classic supporters who buy gavin's claim that a hardfork in 28days is plausible. it is at least a topic that one can have reasonable debates about.

that is wrong u/memorydealers as 4 people who were at the meeting were sources for the article.
i supported HF first but SF first won the consensus process by a huge margin. SF first and then rally and work together to do a joint HF afterwards is the pragmatic thing.
its more useful to make bitcoin succeed than hold onto gavin's ego. tell him to stop being butthurt.

roger ver u/memorydealers invests in blockchain and other bitcoin companies. he likes coinjoin and privacy and fights for user rights and against censorship and does a lot of good promotion of bitcoin. it is not good if he is fighting bitcoin devs over confusion about the best way to scale quickly. guys you need to talk with him.

@_date: 2016-04-12 23:47:57
gavin I support a HF first as pragmatic.
but please you are embarrassing your supporters! renting hashpower to force a fork is not how bitcoin works at all it is longest valid chain and users decide what is valid. armstrong got slammed for that same basic misunderstanding. it is also very unethical to recommend that companies with money temporarily buy hashrate to override public opinion. if that is what you're saying you should be ashamed for calling for that.
jgarzik disagrees with you on 75% and 28days being practical. he said 3months minimum which is after the halving. i think 3months would be ok plan for HF start now and enable it after segwit as a compromise.
failed experiment huh you have been listening to mike rage quit hearn. please dont talk with that toxic guy. bitcoin is not failing it is taking off. lightning is coming this summer and that gives real scale for new uses. and we need to scale onchain too which segwit &amp; HF will do whichever order they are done in.
you might not have wanted a SF first and neither did I, but a SF first followed by a HF is ok too. a decision had to be made and it was made by consensus, but consensus is not unanimous. it is what the majority of developers wanted  and what the hashrate and exchanges want too

posted this on the r/btc thread same topic in reply to one of the astroturfers who justified false stories "i'm absolutely hell bent on shaming blockstream core and his corrupt or misguided entourage at every occasion because i'm really convinced they are damaging bitcoin original vision !!"
my comment back to him
does it occur to you that bitcoin core supporters who are the majority of users and companies think that classic and u/gavinandresen is reckless and damaging bitcoin original vision !! reasonable minds can differ.
I'm sure you know their arguments centralize and fail like paypal 2.0. watch this from gemini exchange for example 
given most of the protocol brains of bitcoin think what the winklevoss twin said there you are in tech &amp; biz minority onus on you to make clear your point. other big companies and exchanges have similar views. not all of them of course it is mixed some prefer to do a hard fork first probably because Gavin told them it could happen faster (which is untrue but rational minds can debate it like civil humans)
anyway the thing I want to point out to you &amp; minority of other people acting like this here is bitcoin core supporters are not engaging in aggressive false stories about classic supporters. they are not doing ad hominem of the day against you, gavin, brian armstrong, marshall, rogver ver. they really could as easily as you are everyone has a story that can be spun or that can be made up as you do. they are not making death threats daily some here are doing that to but mods delete them.
are you sure you're not hurting your cause by lashing out at those that gives counter points and discusses things logically? will they want to talk with you the way you are acting and making this forum look? I put it to you classic supporters are its worst enemy.
ultimately before the year is out one way or another all these people will need to work together. that is more likely to happen in a way that sees you have any influence if you act rationally like a human being than slinging poop. treat people as you wish to be treated. the other guy is not the devil he is just analyzing tradeoffs and making proposals same as you. be rational please and help yourself.

there is no fucking way a HF is going to activate in 1month. no way. gavin claiming 109 was tested is not real he didnt test jack he never has. there arent any active classic developers to cover for him.
when the grownups do a HF there will be rigorous testing like on CSV which takes 3months or more it would be reckless to do a HF without proper testing. jan 2017 would the earliest even if every last fucking developer and all of reddit was prioritizing a HF.

why do they do that?
@_date: 2016-04-11 14:27:35
it is the average transaction size that is reduced to 2/3 - 1/2 because aggregation signatures are reused, the compression of sigs vs current must be much higher.

agree some proposal had to come first and someone is going to be grumbling it wasnt theirs but as long as it works ok in either order in the grand scheme.
amen to a bit of positivity lots of scale coming down the pipe. its not sure how much the media listens to us but reddit has been a grumble zone lately.
time for some moon talk. and why not as u/jonny1000 said on chain scaling to 8x in 18months and lightning coming this summer thats good enough for me even if a simple hardfork first would have been preferable. feeling bullish already. 
the halving will probably be ok too because the hashrate probably wont fall that much and the blocks are not totally full since the spam stopped. but it would still be damn nice if segwit was activated first with blockchain.info or someone who makes lots of transactions switched over. anyone know handles for blockchain info programmers to tag?

but that is more odd reasoning if i understood you would like to see 2mb hardfork size to give time for lightning. but segwit gives 2mb and malleability fixes required for lightning. segwit is the quickest way to scale to 2mb and the quickest way to get real scale with lightning.
blockchain info and 21 and poon and blockstream and amikopay are all doing lightning. should they stop that take a holiday while gavin and r/btc friends fight to delay progress?

we do want businesses that are helping bitcoin succeed to have the chance to. but i agree it is more important to focus on the users interests which are long term a few of the startups will be out of money this year and so panicking.
also do not believe u/gavinandresen's claims he is very political and exaggerates and is biased as some payment companies gave him options to pay him. 
economic majority support is for core  the biggest exchanges and majority of hashrate are for core.
i supported a HF first but a SF first and working together on a HF next is ok too. it is disappointing to see u/gavinandresen stuck on politics and pissing away reputation. wake up the vote is over.

written by a small group of the same people
when challenged a few of them basically admit they are full of hate and barely rational and clearly know they are lying and promoting false stories.
down vote you say? wtf. r/btc upvotes the false stories aggressively and downvotes anyone who corrects them. even someone is running a vote bot to do that and was caught and admitted it on bitco.in
even big bitcoinpeople anyone who dares criticise u/ydtm and u/hellobitcoinworld astroturfers gets personally attacked. like go google for hours to find old posts from when they were teenager to try create a negative story and make a conspiracy. this is normal tactics for astroturfing you cant fact disprove because you are wrong and shilling for a special interest that you cant name so you attack individuals. go listen to some youtube vids about how monsanto and drug companies do astroturfing. they explain this exact behavior.

i was previously supporting doing a HF first but i think a SF first followed by a HF first is good enough also. consensus was decided last year  by vast majority of the technical community and large miner and industry support also  after much technical discussion 
while it was not my preferred outcome that won a decision had to be made and consensus is not unanimous. and it is now time to work together on a HF after segwit and put the controversy behind us.
shrill comments like this are not helpful "Majority hashpower wins, unless they try to force through a change that is rejected by majority economic power (exchanges, merchants, users)." -u/gavinandresen that's not even factually correct see  by Cornell university professor emin sirer "Let me quickly describe why this is technically incorrect, and how it points to a social issue that we need to fix."

try some introspection and honestly look at the posts of Thomas Zander and Peter Rizun for unpleasant people. you yourself have been trolling and mean spirited towards developers often. treat others as you wish to be treated. also do something useful. you are drawing $200k from mit donors money and attacking bitcoin. developers are short of resources resign and give someone else the job if you arent using the money for the purpose it was donated. you can bet dci donors are annoyed at you wasting their money and harming their btc investments. every time you open your mouth btc price falls you are becoming a bitter human like hearn. get a hold of yourself and think about what you're becoming or hurry up and rage quit so bitcoin can move on.

say goldman sachs or hedge funders took a leveraged short on bitcoin and paid miners to do something fucked up. voting fraud is *not* ok, fucktard.
@_date: 2017-01-01 20:58:26
you are delusional. do some research.
@_date: 2017-01-16 19:29:28
That's not true u/statoshi. You tweet links to your statoshi site. The reason u/theymos dox might be searchable at all is because of the persistent unethical doxing of him on other forums and by people with weak moral fiber like the whiney rage quitter. Attempts to doxing theymos on reddit have mostly been promptly deleted.
@_date: 2017-01-16 19:30:53
Quite crappy of them. Once one douche doxxes someone it's ok claim they are doxxed so they are publicly known, NOT. 
@_date: 2017-01-17 13:30:22
It would be great if u/memorydealers got himself sitewide banned on reddit by moderators, ideal way to get out of the sock puppet hell he is funding on rbtc.
@_date: 2017-01-16 18:06:37
You can see it in the modlog except modlog is down how convenient. See  from u/whalepanda.
@_date: 2017-01-17 13:39:15
Still waiting for explanation from u/Mandrik0 of banning of u/cowboyandresen vs ignoring impersonation of u/thcymos.
@_date: 2017-01-17 16:12:42
u/Mandrik0 silence is deafening.
@_date: 2017-01-16 18:07:52
How comes almost all defenders of Roger are disposable anonymous socks? Almost like he's paying people to sock for him.
@_date: 2017-01-16 14:40:03
He did get censored my u/mandrik0 for doxxing, who is an employee of bitcoincom Roger's company. Guess u/memorydealers was chicken to not get banned by reddit main moderators. See the modlog.
@_date: 2017-01-17 13:44:15
btw Dont link to bitcoincom in url form, it adds to google placement.
@_date: 2017-01-02 20:04:02
Ver is bribing miners on top of fees and reward. this is voting fraud.
@_date: 2017-01-17 13:41:44
Exactly. Blatant double-standards u/Mandrik0.
@_date: 2017-01-19 16:25:35
No, it was not. He does not want to be doxxed so fucking stop already. Why are you fixated on doxxing him???
@_date: 2017-01-16 11:33:57
Seems u/prohashing is suspended too. u/memorydealers what happened with the censorship free, no topics barred forum. You claimed people would see the logic and reason behind Unlimited if only discussion of it was not censored on rbitcoin. And you cant even have discussion on your own forum without getting censored. I do think your and prohashing's thought there was anti-science I would take a genius idea that benefits bitcoin from even whiny rage quitter himself, but we shoud support to the death peoples right to say dumb shit maybe one day a dumb idea will turn out to not be so dumb and lead to a new amazing improvement. Like say emergent consensus, lol, pigeons. How else are we to progress if we cant discuss dumb things and let the discussion run for itself, and let people build and hurt their reputations for conviction in free speech, scientific tolerance of ideas and loyalty to bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-01-16 18:30:09
u/theymos clearly, clearly, does not want to be doxed.
@_date: 2017-01-17 13:49:01
That's false and you know it. Posting name of person who widely uses real name is allowed. Doxxing of person who evidently wants privacy for real name whether well known or NOT is not allowed.
@_date: 2017-01-17 13:36:31
rbtc is a joke and any self respecting mod would resign immediately, or ban people who continually attack anyone well known who contradicts their shill army narrative starting with u/ydtm. That wont happen because the mods work for Roger and Roger is paying people to attack developers like luke. Banning ydtm would slow down the sick personal attacks when Roger wants them to happen.
Watch instant deletion of parody account u/cowboyandresen anything to say about that u/Mandrik0? vs u/thcymos and u/nul1c misleading impersonation attacks are left to run for months. Do you have any self-respect left u/Mandrik0?
@_date: 2017-01-17 11:26:43
u/cowboyandresen was banned after making one post on rbtc and is an obvious paraody. u/thcmos and u/nul1c are rbtc regulars and posting often they do not get banned, while being visually hard to recognize impersonation. You think that is coincidence?
@_date: 2017-01-17 13:28:12
Same for u/cowboyandresen currently banned on rbtc. And double standards u/thcymos is not banned nor u/nul1c. 
@_date: 2017-01-16 19:15:03
So can we start a list of who is banned/censored on rbtc the "uncensored" bought and paid for reddit of decamillionaire Roger Ver.
Who else? Must be lots.
@_date: 2017-01-17 16:11:31
Agree that is why appeal to his good character to huge moderation inconsistencies. 
@_date: 2017-01-17 13:27:02


Fact: the rbtc moderators who are on Roger's staff have not banned u/thcymos but instantly banned u/cowboyandresen.
@_date: 2017-01-17 13:43:26
Not just promoting merit of proposals. Roger has used ends justify means logic to pay socks and shills to brutally attack individual developers and pay his moderators to allow it to go on unhindered, while banning anyone who tries to add balance to the technical claims which are almost always 100% false.
@_date: 2017-01-16 15:03:19


What about it? Soft-forks are better.
Why do want a hard-fork?
@_date: 2017-01-16 19:06:51
Why because you work for Ver and he's about to go postal? I am supposed to be scared?
@_date: 2017-01-22 00:20:37
Up to you, just checking you were aware.
@_date: 2017-01-17 13:40:58
From bitcoin jesus to bitcoin judas. u/memorydealers you need to think about your actions morals and ethics. Community reputation is sinking to scum levels.
@_date: 2017-01-16 19:15:52
Could you do it? Someones got to do it this is ridiculous.
@_date: 2017-01-17 13:32:51
In that case could you explain why obvious parody account (it's in the name) u/cowboyandresen was instantly banned while actual misleading impersonation attempts are left to run unhindered for months on rbtc like u/thcymos and u/nul1c ? Is it because they are on bitcoincom staff like yourself and part of a coordinated shilling campaign?
@_date: 2017-01-16 22:41:05
Yes. The double standards are insane nullc was temporarily banned by u/memorydealers staff for linking to a github message with Gavin's email address, even though that's on his own webpage. Contrast Roger did a straight dox of theymos and is not banned. u/cowboyandresen parody account was banned for "impersonation" while two fake accounts with intentionally misleading names thcymos and nul1c are not banned. 
Roger is classic rich boy story thinks he can do whatever he wants because he's employing people and buying influence. Roger bought the rbtc subreddit. He employs the moderators so thinks he is immune. Roger's motto is to cry wolf about censorship while censoring like a mother and employing enough socks to whitewash his own story.
Fuck that u/memorydealers. We're on to your shit. It's down hill for you and your bullshit from here.
@_date: 2017-01-04 01:33:36
is bitcoin loaded, but  r/btc poster and buttcoin SEC troll admitted he owns no bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-01-16 18:30:45
And I see the mods deleted your dox attempt, good on them.
@_date: 2017-01-03 06:50:18
I see you dont like to answer: again are you paid by ver?
@_date: 2017-01-17 13:59:54


Agree? Have a proof otherwise?
@_date: 2017-01-17 13:54:01
it is the double standards and apologizing for blatant abuses by moderators by shills like you that is sickening.
@_date: 2017-01-16 19:11:12
Well duh u/thcmos and u/nul1c are u/memorydealers staff. More of the same some animals more equal. No doxing, nor impersonation (actual impersonation not parodies) that only applies to proles, not Roger "decamillionaire" Ver who gets to buy reddit forums and employ all the mods.
@_date: 2017-01-16 14:49:00
u/mandrik0 you are an employee of bitcoincom right? ballsy move censoring your boss! Did he ask you to to avoid a sitewide ban from reddit without losing face of having to admit he was wrong to try to doxx u/theymos.
@_date: 2017-01-16 21:27:41
If they are intentionally not making their name known it sure is doxxing.
@_date: 2017-01-16 19:32:37
So why do I need to back off? Why do you give a shit about defending Roger's make money fast douchey site?  defending his army of paid moderators and shills?
@_date: 2017-01-16 11:37:42
Lets see how this thread fares on "uncensored" forum rbtc vs "censored" forum rbitcoin   Can rbtc withstand self-examination or will it brigade and paid bot vote to oblivion anything critical of its owner. My prediction is rbtc hates anything no in their tinfoil hat brigade u/ydtm and army of paid socks.
@_date: 2017-01-19 04:02:32
He does not.
@_date: 2017-01-16 18:05:28
Very corrupt. claims anti-censorship then has his employees censor anyone who contradicts his army of paid shills. rbtc is a bought and paid for advert for bitcoincom with services such as pay to upvote bots, casinos and paid advertising of questionable proposals Unlimited.
@_date: 2017-01-02 08:16:01
still not done your research yet? hint research Ver's pool
@_date: 2017-01-03 05:42:58
wtf? are you paid by ver? hypothetical a few whales decided to bribe miners to signal for segwit and it worked would you say that's great too? in politics it is called voting fraud, regulatory capture, bribery, graft, lobbying. it is everything that is wrong about politics.
@_date: 2017-01-16 18:00:50


Theymos did not publish his name. Is u/memorydealers paying your salary?
@_date: 2017-01-17 16:12:07
Only so because douchey people keep doxxing him!

Maaaybe some of them. but then if they had an EQ they should do what Wences Casares did and express regret at the unintended hostility.
There is ample evidence that many are holding ongoing grudges and promoting alts and forks over BTC.
Brian "can't say Bitcoin" Armstrong investing in Ether and alts pivot coinbase to alts. Slow to have segwit.
Peter "airdrop" Smith promoting BCH now BCHABC no segwit even though promised years ago. Now promoting bullshit airdrops. Do not trust this person.
Steven Pair bitpay showing fake fees lying about bitcoin tx cost. Promoting BCH now BCHABC. Took funding from Jihan Wu.
Roger "Judas" Ver. Scamming full time, lying that BCH then BCHABC is Bitcoin and pumping alts. Tried to bribe companies to switch to ABC. This guy is aggressive scammer stay away.
Jihan "fuck your mother" Wu. Holding 1,000,000 BCHABC coins. Funded the attacks. Invested in any company to flip to ABC, like Bitpay.
Sorry but these guys need to be shunned. Never forget. The others maaybe.
Mike Belshe never heard regrets. Maybe. Two cofounders quit from BCH focus shadow of tech capabilities left.
Barry "noted" Silbert. Promoting alts with trust wrapper latest Ether Classic. Probably not bad faith just bad advice.
Erik "spammer" Voorhees. Problems self created did another ICO after SEC penalty on satoshi dice. Probably not evil but he can surely write long stories about being wrong hes done it on other topics eg the OP topic! He can easily say he was sorry. Maaybe.
@_date: 2019-01-14 00:41:52
No, it is very necessary the companies should be boycotted! Do not support companies that support forks and alts over bitcoin or attack fungibility!
@_date: 2019-01-09 18:12:51
there were businesses that replaced their web integration away from shapeshift. obviously they were not BTC only or there would be no integration duh. similar for users boycotting. google canadian bitcoin alliance businesses and Voorhees eg 
@_date: 2019-01-09 17:51:00
Of course the friction from kyc hurt them but you won't know relative attribution less they publish statistics but for sure many actual whole businesses boycotted them since the B2X fork.
As well shapeshift use it swapping alts and the alt market is 95% down so that has to hurt them also.
@_date: 2019-01-09 18:09:48
it was not just individuals but companies with web and app integration. not only cause but one.
