Very painless. I told them  before checking out. And she got the manager just in case. They were able to scan my phone and I was on my way.

Which is why you don't create an account with email

He's simply covering himself legally from committing libel or slander. Chances are highly likely brock was involved with distributing or making or raping child porn.

Downvote me all you want. I was right, too bad I listened to the naysayers and not my gut.
@_date: 2014-04-08 10:22:37
Which is why nobody uses a s***** operating system like Linux

Yes! What gave me away?

Kinda funny you said this the night before heartbleed became public on openssl

I hope you don't live In the US. Where the law is exact on who is a minor and who is an adult.
"Young adult" Is just the way you convince yourself it is acceptable.

The vultures in this thread are pathetic.  I can't wait to see them all starve to death.

I was probably the last person to get my coins out og gox before they shutdown withdrawals. I bought at 950. I have been selling for a loss since
@_date: 2014-04-16 11:52:52
Wait how is buying something from coinbase a reportable event....I sense troll
@_date: 2014-03-21 01:40:03
Tmobile accept bitcoin and I will switch my whole family from att.
@_date: 2014-02-13 09:23:30
Coinbase cancels high risk when the price goes up not when you lock in a price and it goes down. Very shady imo

Okay? Just like when I get a loan for a car I have to say Im not laundering money. I don't file my car under a 1099. I still don't see his point.
@_date: 2014-03-26 11:51:56
Oh god, You guys can probably Dox me just by my grocery list.
TIL: smoking Marlboro 100's means I'm probably not straight... And that's probably right.
@_date: 2014-04-08 10:13:38
Maybe you should have kept your bitcoins in your block chain .info wallet instead of trying to be a super suave  techie and moving them around everywhere
Multishit sounds like a scam
@_date: 2014-04-28 00:17:25
So you just gave someone less than 2 quarters? In most of the United states, if you're gonna tip someone 45 cents, you don't tip them at all and just say thank you.
@_date: 2014-04-16 12:53:59
Bitcoin is property.

Chaturbate promotes minor actors by not having rigourous age verification. A lot of times you will have 16/17 year old actors who just scan fake ids. Chaturbate needs to go away and anyone who supports them supports the exploitation of children

This is the problem, lots of conflicting viewpoints. I've always seen people saying not to get into mining as greedy. They brought his problem upon theirselves. Making the mining process so convoluted.

Don't call me stupid you bitch. Go back to the kitchen.

Yeah once cigs are over $6.00 here ill probably quit though or vape.

I actually do I've given $1750 to charity in the past year, but I'm not on some internet site bragging about having 40 dollars in a doge coin account and tipping a dollar like you are.
@_date: 2014-04-28 07:58:38
I dont give a shit dude, I've been tipped dogecoin before i don't even know where they go, nor do I care.
@_date: 2014-01-06 08:28:22
You guys must be a hoot to hang out with.


@_date: 2014-01-03 14:43:56
Did you report that five thousand dollars to the Irs?

Please downvote this pedophile sympathizer

Its funny you say that because most of the wealth in the us is just digital numbers in a bank account. There isn't enough cash to represent our magical money.

Most games offer a service where you can trade your gold for real world value. I personally have made $100's of dollars converting my wow gold to overwatch licenses then selling those on g2a, and blizz is none the wiser. I've tried to tell people that this shit should be regulated according to the law but nobody seems to care, and just has it out for bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-29 00:18:14
Yes, cause you just blew up my phone and froze my gyft app while I was just trying to buy my bf a gyft card. ^-^

LOLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL I bought over $10k worth of btc at $115. Unless btc is too heavily invested into me, Idk what you're talking about.

Considering how mist people make decisions based off pure greed and emotions. I would say this dream is more of an indicator than a lot of things. 
@_date: 2013-12-28 21:29:50
I think it comes from the fact that everyone here is used to analyzing every single thing here that has btc in it as either bullish as bearish, when most of the time it literally means nothing. When they are faced with something to anaylze that really does mean anything they don't know how to respond so they respond with lowbrow remarks and/or attacks of the ops.
