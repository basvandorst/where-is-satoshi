yes, writeups would help.
Additionally, when we have an idea of what it will take to setup nodes on a VPS for complete optimization, we could possibly release a BASH script, with the help of that everyone could use.

The coinmap.org website crashes instantly on my phone. 
So hopefully in get a couple good recommendations from @_date: 2014-05-12 21:17:25
Also, what Jameson mentioned at the end of his post: 
@_date: 2014-04-13 16:23:16
Just landed. Hopefully something on one of those restaurants on the websites will be close enough before we have to get to the arena. 
@_date: 2014-05-10 17:38:24
Sweet it works great!

Thanks for the 100 uBits - here's it coming back to ya! @_date: 2014-04-13 16:23:56
Cool. I'll check their menu out.

A user messaged me with some tips/ideas.
Are there any VPS companies who accept bitcoin with datacenters all around the world?
@_date: 2014-05-10 17:18:28
IMHO... start small, then grow.
@_date: 2014-05-10 23:22:34
Very smart.
Yes, I read somewhere that the network can only allow a set number of connections to a certain ip address.
We would certainly want to have as high efficiency as possible between active connections and server hardware specs.
@_date: 2014-05-10 17:36:16
hmmm i think you might be right. But it didn't remove it from my account. ill try again!
@_date: 2014-05-11 19:18:00
Thanks for the bits. Will put them to good use.
@_date: 2014-07-30 23:36:41
That's great and all, but does anyone know if it's all being immediately converted? If they aren't saving any BTC, then they really aren't supporting the benefits. To them, it's just another fiat revenue source. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 13:26:34
That's a start. Only one place really close enough to is down there. 
@_date: 2014-05-10 19:08:01
Chunkhost seems like a good option, since they accept bitcoin already.
I am looking at their website, but they do not show any information about where their data center is, or if they have datacenters in other countries.
I feel it would be important to setup nodes in multiple other countries. Their is a strong concentration of nodes in US and Europe, but few in South America, Australia, and Africa.

What are some good crowdfunding companies that accept bitcoin?
I found bitcoinstarter.com but am unimpressed.
I would like to set a goal of getting 1 VPS up and running and funded for a whole year to start.
We could have a community vote on where, geographically, it should be hosted.
@_date: 2014-05-11 17:41:34
I agree that the average node operator should look to run a node at home. But I also feel that it is starting to become impractical. 
Just a couple reasons: 
1. The rise of laptops, tablets, and smartphones. (Decline of desktops)
2. Power efficiency.
My first goal when researching how to setup a full node was to figure out if I could set it up on a Synology NAS Diskstation. I figured it would be a good place to run it, low power/head/quiet, but then quickly realized that running a node would take up the complete memory and cpu capability, leaving the functions of why I originally got my NAS, less than appealing. I also use my desktop for gaming, so it would be cumbersome to stop/pause the bitcoin instance everytime I wanted to play. And for the price of buying a new desktop system dedicated to a full node, I could put toward a VPS that runs it more efficiently.

I started this thread a little over a week or so ago for the creation of a new foundation.
Similar goals, however it is more decentralized.
It focuses more on the adoption of Bitcoin in your local area with support from the main foundation.
What's your all's thoughts on this?
@_date: 2014-05-10 17:26:28
Thanks! I am going to try sending them back to you now too!
@_date: 2014-05-10 17:19:16
I've never sent or received, and too would like to try it out. Thanks!
@_date: 2014-05-11 00:03:16
Where do you run them?
How many connections do you have for each?
I agree with statoshi above, modifying the Bitcoin core to maximize efficiency. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 13:27:00
Cool site, btw! Thanks for sharing!
@_date: 2014-03-09 02:03:36
The Local Foundation
@_date: 2014-05-11 00:11:08
Yes! Quality over quantity in my opinion. 
If we can successfully get one running in a high demand area, with optimal efficiency and connections, then we can create a rule set to abide by when seeking donations for more Full Nodes. 
Like you have recently done, the main thing right now is to determine the optimal region, research data centers, then seek donations for a hosting of a full node for at least a year before we have to worry about re-upping it's payment.

Here is the section he mentions Bitcoin.

Thanks for the 100 uBits - here's it coming back to ya! @_date: 2014-05-10 20:59:28
Awesome! I would really appreciate your help and guidance! This could be a tag team effort.
What steps are taken in choosing where to host a node?
@_date: 2014-05-11 17:30:01
Thanks for the donation!
@_date: 2014-02-20 13:25:51
Me thinks Gox was the safe haven for hackers who stole BTC from SR/Inputs.io/you name it, giving kickbacks to Karpeles for fiat withdrawal. 
Now that Gox implemented identity verification, at the treat of ending up like Shrem if they didn't, there's going to be a lot of unhappy hackers.... Not to mention honest traders. 
Buyer beware!
