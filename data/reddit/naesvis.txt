Only if there actually is individuals that have large assets, not if that large GDP is made only out of poor people. The latter would probably buy food and other things before considering bitcoins. 
But yes, there are of course some rich people in India as well. And yes, even some poor people may start trading with bitcoins.

Perhaps he's just a fair-skinned Indian guy? (Seriously meant).

What has the American presidential election got to do with this?
@_date: 2016-10-04 22:55:19
I can't see where you get that from. 
Maybe, if you like.. what do you mean by that? What ideas is it that you percieve as dangerous, and how and why?
@_date: 2016-10-04 23:18:08
I do think I know the most important parts of that. But before we accuse Icelanders and even the EU about being as Stalin and Mao, I would like to have some reasoning behind that. As far as I know, people and experts in these fields wouldn't agree with your factual claims. 
I suppose you know, for example, that authoritarian stalinistic and maoistic communism is considered something completely else than fascism, the ideology branch that the National socialists belonged, even if they have some traits in common, like authoritarianism, where the state rule with a hard hand, and idealization of leaders.

Is it? Why do you expect that? I don't know how many parties comments on that in their policies..?
Also, I don't get how they would be nationalist, either?
@_date: 2016-10-04 13:38:32


Yes. Do the American parties include that in their party programs? They don't do the equivalent here, I don't see why they would include *grundlagen* unless they want to change it..
Even if you don't have any global perspective¹, that doesn't make you a nationalist. Nationalism is a specific ideology, where your own country's supremacy and loyalty to it is central. And if you mean "not wanting to act in global relations as a country", that is a bit much to conclude from that principle program too. 
¹ Also if you don't like the TPP/TTIP (I think those are the same, more or less?), that doesn't make you a nationalist, or even if you don't want to allow in refugees – in that case by itself.

By the way.. I just realised: that is the wrong Pirate Party. That's the Declaration of Principles from the Swedish Pirate Party..

Does Iceland get much attention? This is just one thread, you know. 
Laughable or not, I wouldn't expect anything else than that both say Encyclopedia Britannica or Wikipedia defines communism and fascism as clearly distinct (and different) ideologies. Are you saing that they're probably saying that it's the same? 
@_date: 2013-12-16 23:39:10
Ah, yes.. hmm. Still a bit uncertain if I follow. No capital was moved out, that far is certain. And if the bitcoins is created outside of China the value of those are not chinese at all. If they're created inside China.. well. It is then a product out of private time and computational power/electricity. This (newly created) resource is then being moved out of the country. But one does perhaps not necessarily count this, I suppose... And perhaps not if one is the government of PRC ;)
The money in itself I don't regard as that interesting here, it's just a mean of "transportation" for the "value".. In my mind, my model may have flaws. 
@_date: 2013-12-27 02:39:20
Who are "we"?
@_date: 2013-12-27 02:46:15
Unlike in the real world, I don't think that person gained those coins in a way that was unfair, or at least according to the rules set out in the system. So I'm not sure if it would be unfair? It is unequal, though.

|you can use your Unocoin wallet and buy/sell bitcoins
"with ease".
nice [example]( :) 
(I wonder how it actually is, if it's not really with ease..).
@_date: 2013-12-28 14:19:41
Fair enough. I guess I kind of wanted a definition that was as essential^(?) as possible.. :) 
But I would think that when people say "standard cryptocurrency", they define standard as the "most used cryptocurrency". If "world reserve currency" with that definition is an established term, which I do not doubt, this is more formally correct, but given the above definition, "standard" is not wrong either. Even if that is not strictly the formal definition of standard. This is me nitpicking, one could perhaps say.. ;)
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:51:20
I also interpreted it as $389.. :) Silly difference in commas vs. punctuation.. 
@_date: 2013-12-28 14:17:53
Sure, fair enough. If that is the meaning of "reserve currency", I just wasn't familiar with the expression. 
This could also be what one mean by standard as well, even if that maybe isn't strictly formally/conventionally correct. 
@_date: 2013-12-25 15:37:07
It still is probably true they will skyrocket. If not in this milennia, probably some other... 
@_date: 2013-12-27 21:04:23
The invention "blockchain" would still exist. I think that is what was meant. 
(And if the mining stops for lets say.. 2 hours.. isn't the blockchain just halted for that period then? It doesn't suddenly cease to exist..? If noone would ever connect to the network again, then it would be another thing.. ;) Nit-picking perhaps.)
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:52:04
The price indicates what one can sell or buy it for. That may also be interesting. 
@_date: 2013-12-25 14:23:32
It is unclear what the benefit for the person saying it is, in the first case.  
In bot cases the person could be perfectly honest, though. And no, I don't think one should do a thing just because someone else says it, one should do it if one think there seems to be good arguments for doing so. 
(In an ideal case, that is. Actual descition-making depends on a number of other factors..)
@_date: 2013-12-25 19:05:10
Yes, I see.. over time the curve will become less steep, that's reasonable. 
@_date: 2013-12-28 14:32:22
I think you are generalising a lot. You mean all parlamentaric systems, or perhaps parlamentaric republics? I don't think that the economic elite is the only ones who like those systems, at least not in all cases. Public service-media (solely financed by the public) has a strong hold in some countries (not saying that they are perfectly neutral). The part with the personal voter number allready exist, at least in some countries. 
With that said, yes, I also think it is good to make democracies (and so called democracies) more democratic, and if the blockchain can contribute to that that is also good. 
@_date: 2013-12-25 17:38:17
Well... yes, there is probably (logically) less room, but if that is only a minimal decrease, I don't know if that decrease matters in itself? 
If I were to invest $10 in the beginning of this year, and that increased in value x times, and if I invested $10 now (in the beginning of 2014), and it gets the same increase during the next year, I would make the same amount of money, wouldn't I? 
Not saying this is the case. But on the other hand, I would say that we don't know anything for certain. 
@_date: 2013-12-25 15:34:30
Erh.. but in reality, bitcoins doesn't cost more you more than you put into them. To buy bitcoins for 50 dollars still costs 50 dollars, and still represents a value of 50 dollars... 
But yes, the price of one whole bitcoin could perhaps have some sort of psychological effect on the buyers. 
@_date: 2013-12-27 15:58:18
hmm.. :) okay. 
my point was that we don't all live in republics with a democratic system. and if we do, they may be a bit different among themselves. but I guess a parlamentaristic, more or less democratic, republic is a common system. 
myself I live in a parlamentaristic constitutional monarchy..
@_date: 2013-12-27 21:08:11
Isn't "world reserve currency" about as arbitrary..? I mean, would this still be true if some other cryptocurrency became more popular? 
I'd perhaps say that the bitcoin is "the currently most used [or popular] cryptocurrency in the world", instead. 
@_date: 2013-12-25 15:31:13
Yes, but how much less? Perhaps it has only come 1% of the way, perhaps it has come 75%. Big difference. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 19:31:24
Because China.
@_date: 2013-12-01 13:58:08
Soo.. does this mean you believe that the early investors vere geniouses? Do you think that they knew for certain it would become as valuable as it has been now, or do you think they just gambled and made an investment for fun, for better or for worse? Isn't that about as splendid as choosing to paint your house in a color that happens to become popular the next year? How is this a desicion to be idolized? 
I'd think that we cannot know for certain what will happen in the cryptocurrency markets, but maybe thats just because I'm not that smart. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:41:54
And then you will have moved "value" out of the country, or do I misinterpret? 
@_date: 2013-12-27 22:14:24
Hmm, okay. Well, yes, I don't know the details.. :) And then ... would this make so that the longest version of the blockchain would be the one with forged entries?
