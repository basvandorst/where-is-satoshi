Once I regained access it was available, but recommended that I move my stick into a new version/type of wallet

Dear magic internet money wizard, thank you.

There's a legacy password reset somewhere in there too. That's the one you want. Took me a few days with the same problem. You'll find it. Looks ancient but it worked for me.
Fingers crossed you have your original pass phrases though.

Hello Mr. Fenton. Given that there is a finite number of Bitcoins to be mined, what is your prediction for the state of Bitcoin, when that last coin is uncovered? Do you think more will be released or do you think the difficulty to mine will be so great that it will never be mined?

Good point. I chose this as I thought it would be a great entry point to BTC, seeing as how buying the gear for that 240GHs looks like it would cost upwards of $20k.

I spent a few hours trying to make a buy with cash, visa and paypal. All of which resulted in me having to do ridiculous bank information forms to websites I've never, ever heard of. Is there any way to actually make a bit coin purchase like a normal human consumer?

I actually have a Coinbase account, but I'm a Canadian resident so the buy option is severely limited. The only option I've found so far has been to use the local BTC ATM we have here in Vancouver. At the time before I signed up for mining and my math was still wrong, the loss at the ATM was more. Oops.

After an hour or so of the miner stopping for my pool, it ended up being 0.005etc, which is an AWFUL RETURN. More of my bad math results in never getting a return at all, unless BTC rises 20x. I'm definitely not going to be furthering any mining contracts.
Futhermore I'll probably not be investing in BTC at all anymore. Seems to be this was only a gain for early adopters, but I'm open to suggestions. Decentralizing currency is one step closer to a globally structured economy yadda yadda.

So if mining isn't profitable with bit coin, what is then?

A year ago I had an argument with my best friend about how unregulated, decentralized 'bit coins' were never ever going to take off and look at them now! Neither of us got into it a year ago and we're both laughing historically at how dumb it was to not get into. Now he's too broke to get into it and I'm here getting hammered with bad deals. talis est vita

All incredibly good points and great tips. As I'm pretty new to this whole whirling pool, here's the details I can give you that the Miner also helped me with when I asked about the results.
BTCGuild is the pool I joined. The Miner I leased the contract with told me that it's PPLNS and that there is a % of pool fee which is taken as well as a maturity for the actual number of Earned shares(?) is resolved.
What I gather is the number has actually grown over the past few hours that this contract ended so the number might be greater than I reported right after the time ended. Which is good, but the return is still awful.
Any other details you can shed on that?
The drop in the bucket to try the lease of mining gear was great and I'm not complaining to the seller, so what would be a decent GHs to get into this to be profitable within say, 100 days?
