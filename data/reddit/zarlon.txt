Most people in my country have debt from they start studying until the age of ~60 if they have a normal financial intelligence and a job. That's a long chunk of your life not to invest in crypto (or anything)
Is the situation in the US different? Are you all renting instead of buying houses?

They're going to have to revert those defaults in Europe in just about [T minus 5 months]( Unless they don't care about the 4% gross revenue fine, that is

It's not whataboutism when I point out that the problems he claim are unique to cryptocurrency  are in fact rampant in fiat economy as well. However, fiat has found a way to keep fraud at a manageable level, as will crypto in due time

Because you don't know where the new local minimum is before it's too late

I was one those newbies who bought three weeks ago and sold last week. I have to say it was _really_ difficult to make a solid judgement no matter how much I read about segwit2. Advice were all over the place both here and in r-btc. Blogs were like "why segwit2 is different than previous forks". The decision for me was not between BTC and BCH, but buying BTC before or after the fork. . When segwit was _cancelled_ everything changed though.  I moved my coins pretty quickly to BCH. Seemed like the only sound thing to do.
Oh well.. The latest conflicting advice is that it's always a good time to buy BTC and you're an idiot to buy at ATH so that's what I'll be doing today

Ah so _that_ was this flippening everybody's been talking about!
