I just went to cvs and made another deposit, from blockchain cash deposit with bitinstant, this time it worked.....
I think I screwed up something the first time... will i still get my bitcoins? supposedly they went through mtgox idk why....

Fuck you.

the op is a scammer

did you use that mtgox code? 
I asked you about what happened about ur bitinstant transaction and then you were ignoring me so i assumed that you robbed my bitcoins from me. some people say that that APIResponse is a redeemable code, some say it is not.  
regardless if it isnt or not, 
did you attempt to use it? that was all the money I had.

Fuck you.
