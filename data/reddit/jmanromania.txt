Even in Communist societies, physical assets are of prime importance.
Can't do things without things.

I prefer [book value](
If you're trying to speculate on how cash flows will play out, you'd better be damn sure your speculation will hold, and if you want to be *really* sure, you'd better double-check the geopolitical situation involving the asset you're appraising. If you've got *multiple* cash flows, you're dealing with an even larger issue.
Getting all of that into a net present value that is usable is tricky.
Look at the results of the forecasting done by tons of large financial firms, and how it's been skewed by bubbles, and the like.

Total assets/revenue for the year - all costs = Actual Value.
2 + 2 = 4

The laws of physics, the only laws that any of us really obey.
Can't chop down a tree without a hatchet.
Can't dig a hole without a shovel.
Can't climb without a ladder.
Can't shoot things without a gun.
Can't drive without a car.

Yep, personal household finance, nonprofit finance, finance for traveling performance groups...
If my band owned ( for example) 20 tubas, 4 snare drums, 8 trumpets, 36 uniforms,  and one equipment truck, we could put the total cost at, say, $15k, which is a rough, but fair estimate for that much musical equipment. Let's add in how much we're making from gigs/granted from the state (depends on the musical group I've been in). Let's just say that gets us to $20k.
Now, let's subtract how much we have to pay for busing to gigs, how much we have to pay our staff, and any replacement/instrument repair fees. Let's say that cost $5k.
The net worth of my band is $15,000!
It's simple.

That's why you invest them in proper assets.

So, if I buy a bunch of collector's rifles, most of which have Curio &amp; Relic status, and after a decade or two, they all double in value (military surplus *always* does, due to simple physical scarcity), and then people want to pay more money, for my sizable amount of well-maintained antique firearms and militaria, there's a ponzi scheme going on?
I plan to invest a fair amount of my wealth in physical assets, for numerous reasons. 


If I invest in a stock, or help a start-up, they're getting my financial support, of course they're going to have to lose a bit of money, or otherwise compensate me for buying the damn stock! 
How would you like stocks to pay dividends, if not in money?


With physical assets, nope. The value of my collector's firearms has everything to do with how many other similar firearms there are in the world, their availability, relative condition, and accessibility. A properly maintained firearm/general artifact collection will steadily rise in value, simply because the rule is general with antiques:
They erode over time, they become scarcer, and they become fewer.


Who, may I ask, is this 'tax slave', then?

Eh, at least I'm not the one who got their shit pushed in so hard in this thread that they had to resort to a shitty non sequitur. 


We also supported Ceaucescu (dictator of the country I was born in), Noriega, and Saddam, before we let them have their falls from the gallows (ok Noriega's still alive). 
Divide and conquer.
The fuck do you think an evil empire does?
USA: Invented nukes, and is the only country to use them, the internet (ARPANET/DARPANET), TV (Philo Farnsworth), as well as ways to spy on them (PRISM/ECHELON), most modern firearms designs (John Moses Browning is the Paul Erdos of firearms), as well as robots (General Motors unimate).

You mean the bipartisan bill to make weed medical on a federal level, *the nation's capitol legalizing marijuana*, and Vermont threatening to enforce alcohol prohibition, if weed isn't legalized?
We're doing better than ever.
While keeping shit like crack, heroin, and krokodil firmly illegal.
Just add one more class for psychedelics (shrooms, LSD, DMT, etc), that they're for religious use, and only can be bought from religious pharmacies, and we're all done here. 
Keeping hard drugs illegal is also a great legitimization for foreign military deployments.

You want a place where people can *spend* their bitcoin. 
It can be the most secure thing on the planet, I don't give a shit if the only people who take it are shady-ass small online sellers.

...you're just fine with a potential loss of 90% of the value of your savings? 
Just because there's a handful of people willing to accept your bitcoins, *doesn't* mean that you'll be able to exchange them for any kind of meaningful rate. 
What if they're willing to accept them at 1 BTC - 1 USD? 
Diversify your portfolio. Have hard assets.
BTC is worthless if the lights go out.

It *is* a fiat currency, albeit an impromptu one - it's no more organized/official than the money that was *literally made out of playing cards* in [New France]( 
It's certainly not a commodity currency, or a representative currency.

The 2nd Amendment has nothing to do with it.
Pipe bombs, 4-winds shotguns, and plenty of other homemade guns appear, and are plenty capable of taking lives, even in countries where firearms are universally illegal.
As McVeigh showed, a truck full of ANFO is a far bigger worry than anyone with a gun.
You should really read about weapons design, use, and theory before you make a comment like that.
There's a reason other countries ban firearm barrels, though there's no law or regulation that could keep homemade firearms and explosives out of civilian hands, short of banning ownership of metal.
