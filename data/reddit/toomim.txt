A backlog can exist from miners keeping their blocks smaller than the maximum. Miners can always create scarcity. These guys were arguing about the maximum transaction rate.
And snipping fees isn't so bad. It requires you to mine multiple blocks in a row, which you can only do with a proportional amount of horsepower, and in aggregate doesn't the amount you're snipped balance out with the amount you're snipping?
Customers don't care if transactions are snipped—their transactions still get included in the blockchain that wins.

Actually, pools are a great example of how miners can vote with their hashpower.
Consider that when ghash.io reached 50%, a large number of miners switched to other pools. These miners were **voting on the pool**.
On the other hand, imagine if mining were centralized to a few large players. If a single pool became corrupt, and corrupted even a couple of those players, there would be nothing we could do.
We need a large democracy of miners who can switch between pools and choose honest, non-corrupt pools, with good policies for the blockchain.

There's another reason to mine: you are decentralizing bitcoin by contributing to mining.
Most people don't think about mining as **voting on the future of the blockchain**, but it is. Every hash you compute buys you a ballot in the next block's raffle, and the winner of that raffle determines which transactions get to be included in the block.
If a wide diverse variety of miners didn't invest in hashing, the blockchain would be dominated by a few centralized players.
Whether or not you make money by mining, you're still contributing to bitcoin's future. It's like how you contribute to a democracy by voting in the election.

Not true.
Even though it's POSSIBLE to implement multi-sig addresses on the blockchain, it's not the only way.
For instance Bitstamp could have a multi-signature wallet stored in a single address by using Shamir's Secret Sharing. You just create N keys with Shamir, of which K are required to generate the private key.
For Bitstamp's situation, this might even be a superior approach, because it keeps their security system more obscure. Nobody can see on the blockchain how they sign for transactions.

The goal is certainly to create blocks.
You never know if you will find a block. Mining is a probabilistic bet. But the more you invest in mining, the higher your odds, and in the long run, you are definitely contributing to bitcoin.

And by avoiding credit card fees, we can estimate that Overstock has **increased PROFIT by 8.6%**.
My memory is hazy, but I recall an interview where CEO Patrick Byrne said his profit margin was around 3-4%, of which 2-3% is eaten by credit card fees. (Anyone know the source?) Given that coinbase charges 0% (for a merchant's first $1,000,000), then Overstock gets roughly double the profit for bitcoin transactions. That means a revenue increase of 4.3% becomes an 8.6% profit increase!

Device Authentication has the same problem. Let's look again at what 21 wrote:


**This still assumes that the hard problem is getting coins onto the device.**
In fact, that harder problem is building up an ecosystem where people actually care to do authentication on the blockchain. Why would you want to authenticate on the blockchain? The simpler approach is to just hold a private key and sign a message proving that you hold the private key.
But second,
**Authentication doesn't need a blockchain**
It sounds like 21 might be conflating *proving ownership* of [smart property]( with *authentication*. You can use the blockchain to prove ownership of a car, or a title. But this is different than *authentication*.
In fact, the point of smart property is to give you access to property *without* having to know your identity—without *authentication*. Just like bitcoin—I can buy something from you without telling you who I am. With paypal, I have to first authenticate myself to paypal, and then I can control the coins in my account. With bitcoin, I can just send you the coins. With smart property, I can control a car without having to log in and authenticate, because the title's ownership is specified on the blockchain.
The blockchain lets you implement smart property—trustless ownership. But for plain authentication, you don't need a blockchain. You just sign a message with your key. So we're left with two possibilities:
1. The 21 CEO is really thinking of "smart property." If true, then he is sloppy, and doesn't fully understand, or hasn't fully articulated the difference. But if this is their core business model, would you trust someone who gets confused?
2. They really mean "authentication." If true, then they don't actually need a blockchain. Thus, they don't need bitcoins. And they don't need to mine them.
And even if they needed bitcoins, it's easier to just buy them or preload some onto the device. I mean, how many bitcoins are we really talking about here? Just "a single satoshi" per "authentication"!
Let's do some math. Let's assume I want to log into my car 5 times per day, for 30 years. Ok, that makes 54,750 satoshi, or $0.13.
So for 30 years of authenticating my car, I'll need to deposit a total of $0.13. That would be very easy to pre-load onto a $10,000 car.
Let's calculate the transaction fees. Depending on how they want to authenticate, we might or might not be able to use off-chain transactions (e.g. lightning network or micropayment channels), which could eliminate transaction fees. But even if we can't, and have to pay a .5¢ transaction fee per authentication, we're still only looking at $273 over 30 years. So, in the WORST case, assuming no technological innovation (in an area we've seen tons of innovation), we need to pre-load $300 onto a $10,000 car. *This $300 preload cost is NOT the limiting factor in making smart property work.*
There's no way to make sense of 21s words. Why are they writing these things if they don't make sense? Do you trust someone who says things that don't make sense? They've given us 6 potential markets that don't make sense. But a successful company needs 1 market that *does* make sense.

Let me clarify the problem with micropayments. There are *two* steps to complete a micropayment with bitcoin:
(1) Load some bitcoin into your phone/computer/wallet
(2) For every site asking for money, choose how much to give to each one
Credit cards combine these into one:
(1) Choose how much to pay, then pull out credit card, put in the information...
21 could only solve step 1, but they are implying that they could "change everything" and solve both:


No, it's not going to change all that.  It's actually only funding a wallet.  And that step is pretty straightforward, by e.g. pre-loading satoshi onto your phone, adding an extra charge to your cellphone or ios app store bill, or using coinbase/circle. 21 is competing with simpler, cheaper solutions.
The second step is more difficult, as explained by [Nick Szabo]( and others. Even *with* all the ways to load an account, there are very few micropayments markets out there. Mechanical Turk works because it's reliable, predictable, prices are standardized, and people know what to expect once they get into it. We may see more micropayment markets in the future, now that it's easier to experiment with their technology. But 21 isn't solving the hard problem.
21 also isn't solving the technical problem of implementing micropayments. Very few wallets support micropayment channels yet.

Compromising one machine in the datacenter will not get you access to any others.
And, correct me if I'm wrong, but your idea processing only signed work protects you from a hack on the *mining pool*, not the *mining datacenter*, right? We are a datacenter. We are not a pool. (We happen to run a nice p2pool node, but customers are free to mine on any pool they would like.)
Thus, smart property miners would *not* protect against a hack to a datacenter and miner. If you could hack into a smart property miner, you could change the public keys that it requires work to be signed from.
Or are you presuming that someone would hack the datacenter in order to commandeer the network as a MITM, pretend to be each miner's pool, and distribute different shares to each miner?

21 has been mining for many years, actually. Their original plan was to be a successful mining company and own all the coins.
Then they must have run into the trouble of competition, been out-gunned, and then had to come up with a backup plan.
So they "pivoted", and tried to pitch a hare-brained scheme to the venture capital board, in order to look good and avoid a down round, and collect more capital... so that they can postpone the inevitable collapse.

indeed, we must find *unused excess* renewable energy to apply to mining. Otherwise, you're better off using that renewable energy for the regular grid.
But we can solve this problem! Fortunately, much renewable energy happens to go unused because of the nature its renewable sources. You can only put hydro-electric dams on rivers, for instance—and you don't get to choose where those rivers are. As a result, you end up with lots of extra power next to rivers, and a shortage of power in big cities where it needs to be used!
Bitcoin mining is perfectly suited to take advantage of this spare hydropower. You can just ship the miners to a datacenter (like ours, the [Toomim Bros.]( located next to a hydroelectric dam! This is a great advantage of mining. You can do it anywhere! Consider, on the other hand, how difficult it is to ship an entire city to a hydroelectric dam. :) That's why a large country like the USA will have excess renewable energy in some locations and *still* burn coal in the southeast.
@_date: 2015-05-18 20:37:13
This business model indeed looks pretty bad. Let's look at some key problems:
**Ignores Power: the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics**


Their business analysis ignores POWER—which is as important as CPU, memory, and bandwidth on cell phones. Mining needs a lot of power. This will drain your phone's battery. And now that mining has become power-limited, how can you compete with $.02/kwh (Central WA, Saudi Arabia) when you're paying $.10 in your Silicon Valley condo? (See average electricity rates [here]( You'll be paying a ~5x higher electricity rate than industrial mines, which means your bitcoins will cost 5x when mining equilibrates to power costs.
So 21 really believes that people will somehow prefer to mine expensive bitcoins than buy them, because of... convenience? They seem to think that it'll lead to a breakthrough in micropayments.
**Misunderstands the Problems in Micropayments**


I've studied micropayments quite a bit. There IS an argument that the "mental cognitive cost" of a transaction—its "convenience"—is the obstacle to micropayments—not the financial cost of a transaction fee. In fact, Nick Szabo might have made this argument first: 
However, I don't believe it. In my PhD dissertation I've run large studies where I pay and charge people pennies on Mechanical Turk to spend seconds of their time doing small tasks. I've designed user interfaces that make microtransactions simple to understand. (Like, breaking it down into "cents per minute" in the same way you get your phone bill.)
And anyway, 21 would be solving the wrong problem for micropayments. The problem with mental transaction costs is knowing when to pay money, moment-by-moment, as you browse the web and visit sites of varying quality. The problem is *not* getting small amounts of money into your wallet in the first place.
And even if the problem was getting small amounts of money into your wallet, mining is a difficult way to do that, and ignores all the myriad methods that are popping up that pay users small amounts of money to do useful tasks. For instance, ChangeTip gives people bitcoin for writing useful posts. Social media websites pay users to help write engaging articles, curate and organize existing content, or spread ads around. The same company that's micro-charging you for content might be micro-paying you to make the content better.
Or most obvious of all, your cell phone company or ISP might give you a bitcoin balance to use for micropayments as you use your phone or internet connection, and then simply add on the remainder to your bill. Phone companies already do this for "premium" (e.g. 1-900-xxx) numbers.
**Ok, so how did they raise $116m?**

That's not literally true. The pipes under the ocean carry all the traffic from china to the world's internet. Those pipes are much bigger (Petabits? Exabits?) than any individual residential line.
The real question isn't which is more "constrained", but whether you can buy a fast internet line in china if you put a little work and money into it — a small fraction of the work you put into power, capital, and labor.
And you can certainly get fast internet in China if you try. [The average download speed in Shenzhen is 13.6 Mbps.]( And that's just the average connection across the city—certainly higher is possible if you install a node in an urban datacenter, and then [pipe the data]( wherever you need it most, like on your rural farm next to a hydro-electric plant where you do your mining.

Yes, and that's not a bug. That's the specification of the BIP. Why don't you [read it](






Nowhere in here does it say "75% of hashpower on the network." The spec is simply 75 of 100 blocks. The implementation meets the spec. This is not a bug, it's just a disagreement over the spec.
OP implicitly suggests changing this to:






Did that fix a "bug"? No, the trigger can still happen with less than 95% of hashpower. In fact, it can also fail to happen with more than 95% of hashpower. Calling this a "bug" is disingenuous, especially when your change doesn't even fix the "bug."
Look, it's impossible to know the precise amount of hashpower on the network at any time. That's the nature of mining. There is luck involved. Every miner is deeply intimate with luck. It's printed clearly on every [mining statistics page]( Further, even our national government votes have sample variance. It's in the nature of life. And as others on this forum have pointed out, nobody really cares if the *target* threshold is precisely 75%, or 70%, or 80%. These numbers come out of our guts (or asses), which are full of noise already.
And you're seriously worried about a 10% vote triggering at some point in the future? By eyeballing his charts, that would require *a few billion years* of hashing. How long do you think we'll be debating XT for? Maybe 6 more months?

I applaud your attempt to get data! However, your conclusion of 400mb/s is way off:


In fact, there are no American IXPs listed on that website. Since you reasoned that Hong Kong has only 400mbit/s since that's all you see listed on wikipedia, do you agree that the United States, by the same reasoning—which has zero IXPs listed—has bandwidth of 0mb/s?
Clearly, the US has more than 0mb/s bandwidth to the internet.
That page only lists the bandwidth of companies that publicly announce their stats on their website. ISPs in China and the USA do not.
Even academics debate how many IXPs exist in China. For instance, [these guys]( say there are three, but that much of the data is hard to come by.
And what you really want to calculate is the bandwidth of those submarine cables. There are a lot of them:
In 2011, each cable supported between 40Gbps and 10Tbps. If you update those numbers to today's technology, and add up all the submarine cables, and then add in the capacity from above-ground cables and wireless links, I think you'll get into the Petabyte range. At least half a Petabyte, conservatively. I welcome more data.

"Private" chains can be halfway between a private database and a fully-distributed blockchain.
For instance, you can take bitcoin and disable mining by giving a single trusted entity the power to mediate double-spends. You still get a distributed immutable ledger, where anyone can make and broadcast a transaction, hidden behind pseudonymous public/private keys. If the trusted entity goes down, the ledger still functions except for mediating double-spends. This provides many of the benefits of Bitcoin that a federation of private orgs might want without the cost of mining.

I disagree. Perhaps you meant objectively *risky*. Let's look at the definition of "responsible":














So now, is investing 90% of your money in bitcoin responsible? According to the definition, yes, because you *are the primary cause* for it, and you *can be blamed or credited* for its success. Finally, you are *morally accountable* for your behavior.

That doesn't work either. If they sold when the price was going up, they might have sold it all at $30, which was a 3x climb from $10. But then they wouldn't have gotten the millions of dollars from the price reaching $200.
The problem with saying "just sell when the price goes up" is that you don't know how much to sell as it goes up. And as the price continues to go up — it could certainly reach $10,000 and then $100,000 — you lose a lot by selling it early.
The Bitcoin Foundation represents Bitcoin. It only needs to exist if Bitcoin is a big deal. If Bitcoin fails, the Foundation can fail. If Bitcoin succeeds, the Foundation needs strength.

Also, note that ISO might convert XBT to BTC in the future if it becomes popular enough.
They used to call the Euro XEU before it became established enough for them to give it the code EUR.
The main problem is ISO's rule for naming currencies assumes that the currency is fiat, and says that the first two letters need to be from the fiat country's name. This rule isn't good anymore, now that lots of awesome currencies exist without a country behind them. So ISO will need to change its rule. But first it will probably need to be made aware of all the awesome non-national currencies.
Alternatively, we can convince Bhutan to recognize Bitcoin as an alternative to its Bhutanese Ngultrum (BTN), and then ISO might be able to assign it the BTC code without changing its stupid rule.
But honestly, who cares about ISO. We don't need them to "decide" what name we call something. Standards bodies are useful when there's conflict over a definition. But there wasn't any conflict about what to call Bitcoin until ISO created the conflict themselves. Everyone called Bitcoin BTC until ISO introduced the name XBT that nobody was using.
Standards bodies should resolve conflict; not create it. ISO isn't doing its job.

I'm not arguing that ISO used the letter X as a literal mnemonic for the word eXception; only that they use X for currencies that are exceptions to the rule in ISO 4217 of naming currencies after their country code.
If there is no country for a currency, then it does not fit the rule. Therefore it is an exception. That's the definition of the word *exception*:
*exception |ikˈsepSHən|
noun: a person or thing that is excluded from a general statement or does not follow a rule*
Clearly, it is true that ISO sees non-fiat currencies as exceptions, and add an X to them. Although I would agree that "fiat" isn't as precise a word as "national."

Because "XBT" isn't as good an acronym as "BTC." BTC sounds like "Bitcoin". It captures the three most prominent consonants.
XBT sounds like ... Ex-Bitcoin.
Why did ISO add an X? Because they think any non-fiat currency is an *eXception*, and [put an X in front of it]( This is annoying extra noise when you read it.
ISO sees non-fiat currencies as an exception, but down the road, Bitcoin will become the primary world currency, and these fiat currencies will be the exception.
Bitcoin is not an exception. It's soon to become the rule. Let's call it Bitcoin. Not Ex-Bitcoin.

That looks much better! The size contrast with a normal B makes the ₿ stand out distinctly. How wonderful it is to see this new symbol becoming a part of language!
The stems are still difficult to see at small font sizes, though. I'm noticing that they are quite thin—the strokes for the stems are thinner than any of the other strokes in Droid Sans. It looks like you've borrowed the stroke width from the $'s vertical line for the stems on the ₿. However, the $'s vertical line doesn't need a thick stroke, because it runs through the entirety of the S, creating a number of new distinct shapes inside the symbol, whereas the stems on the ₿ only sit at the top and bottom, and are shorter. Thus, there are both fewer pixels to differentiate the B from the ₿, and fewer different shapes, than there are to differentiate a S from a $.
So I think thicker stem lines on the ₿ are warranted. Luckily, it should be easier to make them thicker on ₿ than it is on $, *because* these lines only sit at the top and bottom. If we made the $'s vertical line thicker, it would obscure the S shape.

The government needs no distribution. It could just host a server with a ledger on raspberry pi and mediate all disputes and double-spends itself.

I have an idea.
I just signed up for the payments group, but just signing up for the mailing list is a huge pain in the butt. You have to read tons of legal paperwork, sign documents, declare your employer, yadda yadda... and then they say you'll hear back in 10 days if they accept you and give you access to their discussions.
This is too big a barrier for the open bitcoin community to have good input. The foundation could provide an interface with the payments group that solicits feedback, etc. from the community on the activities that are happening there. A communications channel.
In fact, some of the W3C working groups were initially created *because* the IETF (where the HTML standard was originally being defined) was too open—anybody could participate—making it hard to find consensus. So instead, a bunch of industry players got together in November of 1995 and formed the W3C HTML Working Group (actually the HTML ERB at the time) specifically to give industry members a clear powerful seat at a table. A consequence of this may be that it's hard for non-organizations to represent themselves in web standards. (Read the [full history yourself here](
The Bitcoin Foundation can be an organizational interface to the bitcoin community that helps individual contributors have a say in the activities of the organizationally-oriented W3C.
Then again, it remains to be seen if the W3C Web Payments group is going to do anything worthwhile. I can't tell, because I can't see their discussions. But I'm skeptical, as are some bitcoin developers I've talked to.

Hey luke, at small font sizes, it's hard to see the little stems above and below the B.
Maybe it'd be better to shrink the size of the B, and increase the size of the stems, so that it's easier to distinguish the bitcoin symbol at small font sizes?
We don't need the B to be the same size as a regular upper-case B. Note that the $ symbol has a totally different S shape than the capital letter S: S$.

Bitcoin can't accomplish financial freedom unless it succeeds.

Ah, this is a wonderful explanation!
I agree with you EXCEPT that your conclusion goes a little too far. People do not just want to make a buck off of bitcoin. People actually believe in what it stands for! They are just lazy.
Speculating on Bitcoin is like ... eating at McDonalds is for experiencing american culture.
Ok, fine, I guess you could say that the mass of people aren't really leading the revolution. I guess that's to say that there's just a minority of leaders.

But I don't see how your argument works. You're saying the whole world will become more productive. That doesn't mean bitcoin will be worth more dollars, though, because dollars would be worth more too. Everything would be worth more. People's lives would be worth more.

@_date: 2013-03-24 10:30:52
That isn't true. OP is just citing a bunch of bullshit people on these forums have made up without evidence.
The price fluctuates so much because the bitcoin market cap is still so small that when a single person buys or sells a million or two it changes the overall price by 5%. We need more hoarders to stabilize the price.
@_date: 2013-01-28 07:05:44
Don't think about it like that. Look, if you were savvy enough to out-smart the trends, you wouldn't be asking this question.
Here's the rational way to do it:
1. Estimate how much you believe a bitcoin will be worth in the future
2. If the current price is less than (1), buy. Else, sell.
I believe the price will get go beyond $100/coin within 5 years. So I bought last fall. When it's past my threshold, I'll sell.

As a user buying USD for BTC, how do I know how long I need to wait until the other person's USD payment to me can no longer be reversed?
If someone pays me with paypal, do I wait 1 week? Or 1 month before I can safely release the funds from destruction?

Here's how hoarders stabilize the price:
    1. More people hoard bitcoin.
    2. Market cap of bitcoin goes up to billions.
    3. Now a single transaction of millions affects the price only a little.
       And there is enough market cap to handle billion dollar transactions.
Hoarders create liquidity.

This is actually enlightening.
**Famed economists are confused about Bitcoin.** It does not compute in their minds. It upsets something basic in how they think about wealth.

I love this article, and the premise is a great fit for bitcoin:


Many of us seem in agreement that the *price* of bitcoin isn't what will make it succeed, but rather its use as a stable currency. So why don't we collectively design a better pricing mechanism—a better exchange design—one less prone to wild manipulative swings of value?
This is an excellent step in that direction. Let us brainstorm and design more market pricing mechanisms! Let's make bitcoin stable!

I, for one, didn't understand how Namecoin has the potential to revolutionize control of data on the internet.
I also did not understand how Namecoin not taking off indicates that Bitcoiners are not part of any philosophical or cultural movement.
I'm guessing you think Namecoin has some properties that make it more of a philosophical improvement than Bitcoin, and since people aren't taking up Namecoin, it means that people are a bunch of money-baggers?

$10k is a magic number in banking—it's the maximum that money laundering legislation allows. People trying to get around that legislation might make multiple transactions of $10k. Consequently, a $10k transaction can set off a soft alarm. Maybe this is why the bank freaked out and canceled your wire.

I think I would only check a single sub.
Rationale: Right now, anyone investing in or with bitcoin will care about the bitcoin price. And any news about bitcoin affects the price. And vice versa, anyone interested in bitcoin will be interested in the bitcoin investment system.
So I really don't see a useful separation in the userbases for these two subreddits. I think it would make everyone's lives easier to just have a single source of bitcoin news.
