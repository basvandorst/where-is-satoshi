Look at the chart - the ENTIRE chart, from way back when it was around $2 (eg, 3-day bars on bitcoinwisdom). It's a classic pump-and-dump chart, with the initial blip (which, when zoomed in, mirrors the structure of the entire chart again), the main spike to ~$1200, the drop and rebound, the subsequent bounce down to support, and finally the second hump - recently reaching near major support levels again.
If human nature is anything to go by, we will eventually see the price break through that support, to much tears and anguish of all those who are long.

Thank you, that is a lucid overview of some of the market mechanisms we see at play. Perhaps you have time to answer a couple of follow-up questions..
In this context, "igniting momentum" would be basically trying to cause a chain reaction, if I understand correctly? Doing this, the trader hopes to trigger stops and / or cause trading algos to evaluate the situation as a change of sentiment &amp; put money in play?
Say, if the movement is from $400 to $500, the trader ideally buys near $400 up until the price starts moving without his participation, then sells into the rally as close to $500 as possible. Is the $500 top something the trader estimates ahead of time, or does it come from observing the movement (ie he starts the wave, but where it tops out nobody knows until it does)?
Also: would you care to share your opinion on how an effective lack of shorting makes the bitcoin markets different from "real" stock market?

Anyway, who would collect the taxes, if the currency does not have a corresponding nation-state, or country of origin? 
Fun fact: if you work for the likes of Unicef or World Bank (a lot of work abroad), you actually don't pay taxes on your wages *because you're not reaping the benefits the taxes provide in your home country*.

Kind of a catch-22, isn't it?
The only way I can see this working out is gradual adoption by small entities -- as the market cap grows, the volatility of the exchange rate should decline. So "players" are likely to enter the market smallest-to-largest. This would suggest there will be a "tipping point" in the future, where the network effect kicks in, and using BTC becomes "normal".
@_date: 2013-04-05 19:43:22
I think the pro quants are pro at what they do, ie trading algos. Wouldn't doubt it, if they're making money in that cutthroat business, they must be good. So to see sharks like that enter a pool of soft-bellied nerds (who yes, may be thorough and meticulous as far as software goes, but are total noobs at this particular game of greed and fear) .. makes my skin crawl. If there was a reliable way to short BTC, this bubble would've been crushed already.

Sure, let's walk through this, taking small steps in case we get lost along the way.
You buy bitcoins, with money. You've spent your money, so you don't have it anymore. Bitcoins drop like a bag of bricks. You still don't have your money. But you have bitcoins, which you can trade back for money. Less money than you had though. You already lost all your money, but still have a chance to buy some of it back if you sell your bitcoins.
You can *pretend* you didn't lose any money, by not selling your bitcoins, and hoping really really hard (preferably with your eyes shut tight) that the price of bitcoin goes back up. But even if the price skyrockets to $1000/btc today, you still lost your money. You lost it the moment you bought bitcoins. You don't _have_ any money, you have bitcoins, and the promise of being able to exchange it for money.

I haven't tried it myself (my strategy is to swing-trade the shit to amass as many bitcoins as I can, and ultimately withdraw in BTC), but hearsay has it that the fiat withdrawal is at least a moderate pain on any exchange.

Maybe they named it wrong, but my understanding is that this is not a cyclical phenomenon? As in, in the full history of bitcoin there will be only one trigger, peak, trough, slope and plateau. To clarify, I'm not talking about the price, but success of Bitcoin as a game-changing technology.

The good thing about the BTC markets is that everything is open source, there's freely available realtime data, and (for now) there is no effective means of shorting. That, and lack of real arbitrage opportunities add to the inefficiencies that makes this market a bit more forgiving to the noobs.
@_date: 2013-11-23 01:15:41

How I wish I had some bitcoins to sell you right now..
@_date: 2013-10-26 22:42:39
Seems like most of the comments here missed the point of OP's question -- and since I've been wondering the same, let me elaborate / rephrase..
In this purely hypothetical scenario, if someone lends out all 21M BTC at 1.1% interest, whoever borrowed it owes both the capital (21M BTC) and interest (231000 BTC), the sum total owed (21231000 BTC) is more than all the currency that can exist.
It would seem that it is impossible to honor the terms of such a loan, due to the nature of bitcoin.
If we take a more realistic scenario, loans with interest are still possible in a BTC economy. Suppose someone loans out 100BTC with 1% interest. The borrower will have to pay back more than they borrowed, but this does not mean that an extra 1BTC is conjured from thin air -- it will come from a stock of already mined bitcoins, like the original 100BTC did.
I think the real question here is what the loan is backed by -- does the lender have to have the 100BTC to loan out? Seems the answer is yes, they must have the coins to transfer to the borrower in exchange for a contract promising the return of capital plus interest. They cannot just say "and now you have 100BTC, go spend them as you wish" without actually transferring 100 real bitcoins between addresses.
This is where the key difference between bitcoin and fiat lies: fiat banks of today need not have the funds to loan them out. The bank can just say "hereby we declare you have $100 credit with us, spend it wherever", effectively making up that money. By law, some proportion of the loan has to be backed by actual funds. This leverage is in favor of the bank, since they can loan out (for example) $100 for every dollar they have. A hundred of those loans @ 1%, and they've doubled their money.
Since you cannot do that with bitcoin, I am guessing usury would be far less profitable. The leverage is fixed at 1:1, and the compounding of debt is physically impossible.
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:04:00
Speculators do provide volume, and volume makes for smooth trading on exchanges, so in turn more accessible to others outside the system.. that's the liquidity factor, and until there's a large user base, we get liquidity that comes at the cost of unstable exchange rate. I get that.

@_date: 2013-04-13 23:23:00
Oh sorry. I think that if we start adding fees and controls, it'll all turn into the kind of old-boys' club that the Bitcoin community hopes to make irrelevant.
The likelihood is very high that the software running gox _is_ extremely poorly designed. It used to be a website for trading Magic cards, it's not quite fit to be a realtime currency exchange shuffling around tens of millions of dollars.
Someone asked gox during their AMA about their server/db, to which they replied that they can't say for security reasons. Big red flag -- usually that means their setup is shamefully bad. Just the other day someone linked to a question on Stack Overflow, where the admin of  Bitcoin24 demonstrated terrifying ignorance of pretty basic tenets of db programming. That service is not online anymore, but given the recent performance of gox (and their past history), I'd wager they're not much better.
Usually, when the tech is good, there is no need to be secretive about its inner workings. Take bitcoin -- it's open source, cleverly put-together out of pieces of tech that have existed long before Nakamoto came up with his idea. Any curious person can go and inspect how it works, and that does not make in any more susceptible to an attack.
I'm pretty confident that mtgox is a pile of legacy hacks, and they're scrambling to patch the worst holes with half-measures like delaying the API data -- which still doesn't help, as we saw with the downtime yesterday. I think what you suggested belongs in the same bin of band-aid non-solutions, and would be quickly worked around by clever greedy little bots and their makers.

Ok, maybe ELI5 this one..
The exchange gets fiat from all the depositors who want to purchase BTC. With a low price, people get a lot of BTC for relatively little fiat. Late comers bring more fiat, but get much less BTC for it, as the price has gone up. As the price goes up, isn't is possible that the fiat value of BTC on the exchange will far exceed the fiat holdings of that exchange?
There's ten trillion dollars in circulation *in the world*, if BTC goes up to $500000, there wouldn't be enough USD to make up the BTC market cap.
EDIT: why the downvotes? Seems like a legit question..

Gold is a store of value because it *was* used as currency / means of exchange in the past -- thousands of years of tradition supports it as something that people believe has value.
This is not the case with Bitcoin -- its value is not the current exchange rate, but the innovative mechanism it implements. The recurring bubbles of exchange rate help to bring it into public consciousness, but the only way it will stay relevant is if it's technical qualities are leveraged in real-world applications.

If you had bitcoins to start with, you can trade them (on mtgox at least) with just an email address. Yes you cannot withdraw USD without tying it to a bank, but like you said, the USD account can function just as a "store of value" when you go short to avoid losing money when the exchange rate drops. Withdraw in BTC when you're done, and nobody really knows anything about anything.
I've talked to tax accountants, and given that bitcoin is running circles around anyone trying to think about keeping the tax law up to date, the consensus I've heard is that whatever you cash out in fiat counts as "cash gains" (basically, the equivalent of "miscellaneous").
I agree with you, if you have the nerve, daytrading is a good way to acquire more coins.

Hey, if you're a day-trading speculator, be ready to get burnt.
Yesterday, I sold @ 220, got back in @ 140, sold @ 170 again, am out at the moment. Gox lag was up to 57 minutes at some point. You just have to call your own price, don't let the market tell you what to do.
Volatility is great for trading, you can make money whether the trend is up or down. Keep faith and emotion out of it, and you'll be OK.
There are multiple exchanges, btw, if you really want to trade, use one that's not failing all over the internet.
@_date: 2013-11-10 15:14:05
The dumb thing was not buying back after that bubble popped -- you would have had orders of magnitude more BTC.
@_date: 2013-04-13 03:46:50
Same effect.
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:52:00
everything sucks with lag
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:09:44
Oh noes, personal responsibility!
@_date: 2013-10-18 03:19:23
If there's a finite amount of BTC, wouldn't that create a natural "ceiling" for how much can be borrowed?
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:21:42


OK, gotcha, buy cheap coins now before mtgox goes back online and prices fall further! Thanks for your sage advice.

There will be bubble after bubble, as far as the exchange rate of BTC is concerned. Every time the price becomes volatile, it hurts the long-term prospects of using BTC as a medium of exhange, precisely because of the reasons you outline (and the fact that merchants cannot reliably set prices in BTC, they have to anchor it in fiat).
And every time the volatility goes up, a new flock of speculators has to get fleeced. It is the way greed works.
@_date: 2013-10-30 16:07:37
From a purely TA standpoint, I would agree with you -- as long as by "on the cusp" you mean "we're about to see an unsustainable increase in price" and not "it's about to crash".
@_date: 2013-04-14 23:00:37
I believe it's in a downward trend, and will continue down until it's settled at a price for a long time (weeks).
I'm not holding any, other than during short day-trading sessions, the bumps are fun to ride for a few % here and there.
I'm long-term bullish on btc, I think we will see great things come of it in the future. Short term, bearish as hell.
@_date: 2013-04-13 03:23:56
Yeah, seems that way. Glad I made it out before it ground to a halt again. Looking at the chart, it's gonna be a landslide when it's back online.
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:07:18
I thought the whole point of _fractional_ in Fractional Reserve Banking was that they back up only a percentage of the loan with money they have? Eg, if the ratio is 1:10, they can only cover 10% of the money they loaned out.. the other 90% does not exist until they loan it out.
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:24:43
"Fair odds" ha ha... I wish I had some bitcoins to sell you.
It's gonna drop so fucking hard, the bits are gonna fall out of the bytes for a minute..
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:51:19
This is my primary concern -- all this talk about BTC being worth the moon, but chances are next to none any of us would see actual dollar money had we tried to move any serious volume. IMO, a broader realization of this will bring on the next correction and a world of butthurt.
Think about it: the exchanges are all choked up when trying to withdraw fiat, and this is in a *very bullish* time, when people are throwing cash at them hand over fist. Imagine what would happen if the sentiment changed, and people tried to withdraw fiat at the rate they're throwing it in there... I'm guessing a couple of the new exchanges would go offline, mtgox queue would have a 22 year wait, the exchange rate would punch a hole in the floor, and this sub would be full of sad gifs.
Good thing is, BTC would still work flawlessly after that.
@_date: 2013-04-06 20:50:11
It already has, over the course of past few weeks. Now that we've rendered BTC useless as a currency, people take pause to reevaluate their positions.
@_date: 2013-12-02 17:56:20
It's just a number people get hyped up about, nothing logical about it. Seems to have been the ceiling for this rally, that's all there is to it.

@_date: 2013-04-06 21:29:16
My point exactly. You won't spend bitcoins -- you will convert them to fiat currency, _then_ spend that on stuff.

I think he was reluctant to hold BTC instead of USD -- but I agree, I'm a little uneasy letting gox hold my $$ -- I mean, who knows what those clowns will do next.
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:56:36
I don't like trading hours because it's like pretending that between closing and opening, the market does not exist. It creates these events at open and close -- it seems they tend to amplify sentiment, and a lot of old-school trading rules, as well as all the charts, depend on these discontinuities existing. Local markets can have opening/closing hours, but with global ones -- it's always a business day somewhere. While a good argument can be made for having multiple exchanges working towards price stability, distributed geographically they would effectively form a 24h market anyway.
@_date: 2013-12-07 22:09:13

@_date: 2013-04-16 04:49:45
It takes some people less time to spot a bad situation. He's smart for selling, when the price eventually stabilizes, and resume slow appreciation again, he will be able to buy many more bitcoins with the same amount of fiat.
@_date: 2013-06-10 18:27:23
It's too bad. They had Interac transfers, it was amazing. Not much volume, but easiest way to exchange fiat / BTC, by far (in Canada, especially).

A very ballsy move. So far looks like you've made out pretty well. I believe in bitcoin long term, but the speculation is intense and there might be some hiccups along the way.
No need to be greedy, you're already way ahead of the game. It would be prudent to cash out some of those gains and repay the original investment loan. It's not even a quarter of what your coins are worth now.
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:46:22
Yeah luckily transferring coins between exchanges is easy (it's a BTC transaction). Moving fiat is next to impossible, which is partly responsible for the price differences between exchanges.

You loan out what you have, and then you stop when you've loaned out all that you have. Because you can't loan out what you don't have, or more broadly, you can't loan out what doesn't and cannot exist.
This is the entire point of a hard limit on the number of coins -- because what broke the existing system is greedy assholes loaning out what they don't have, pretending it exists, then passing the bill to us when the accountants caught up.

Yes, it's a DDOS attack. It's perpetrated by legions of panicked bitcoiners, looking to cut their losses. There's no dark evil entity trying to claw bitcoins out of your grasp. It's just other people, freaking out, and weak-ass amateur infrastructure buckling under the volume. Kind of a vicious cycle, really..

These are probably the "put your money where your mouth is" kind of guys, so if you don't have cash on the line, how can you be serious, right?
@_date: 2013-11-24 01:38:20
Pretty much right? It's on the front page of WSJ, it's been all over the internet and media for a week now, can the hype machine step it up any more? Because, honestly, hype is 99.9% of what's revving up the BTC/USD ratio right now.

The predictions have to do with human nature, nothing to do with the commodity being traded. I find that majority of the patterns from stock charts apply here. The only difference is you can't short bitcoin, but big sell-offs accomplish the same thing.

They panicked in the wrong direction..
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:28:18
No I don't think bitcoin would die. I think it's a disruptive technology, and will do to the finance industry what torrents did to music. In due time.
I draw no line regarding the price.. The market will change its behaviour, at some point, from bearish to bullish -- so, I guess, we collectively draw the line, when we're good and ready.
Yes the ease of transfer is one of BTC's key strengths. People who sold off (and there were plenty, if the record volume is anything to go by) are sitting on trading accounts flush with fiat. It's not for lack of funds the price is not rising.
@_date: 2013-11-24 17:24:56

It will be quite interesting to see what they do with the coins -- they've already set a precedent by seizing the BTC, whatever they do next is also uncharted territory..
@_date: 2013-03-27 23:23:27
So this is mimicking existing financial games. Would it escalate all the way the derivatives speculation did? I guess there's no boundless credit in this instance -- nobody can loan out more coins than they have, and nobody can promise a windfall of coins which do not exist.
Also, how do options dampen volatility?

I sold before posting, that's why commentary came a bit late :)
Mostly watching btcchina, these fuckers are on their first ride round the BTC merry-go-round.. other exchanges are less of a bellwether imo.
If Chiners go as low as 3500, you'll see a "significant correction" across the board, dimwits crying "HOLD", all that shit, esp. after the hype machine moves on to the next thing.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:04:43
I think that's the prime reason for the discrepancy -- the inability to move fiat out of exchanges at a reasonable pace. If it was possible, the prices would be in lockstep across exchanges.
@_date: 2013-04-08 15:11:46
It's a wonderful scenario for the other 99% though..
@_date: 2013-03-19 19:21:15
Not quite -- gold does have legitimate industrial uses, as well as being an actual commodity (jewelry, etc). The only value Bitcoin has right now is to the speculators and early investors. This tends to move in waves; recent media attention has brought a slew of new people to the game, and the price was driven up. Once all those people buy up as they see fit, demand will falter, and inevitably there will be a bear run. Of course we can't know when and how much, but it's pretty much guaranteed by human nature.
@_date: 2013-10-19 22:01:20

@_date: 2013-11-24 00:51:40
Yup.. I can't get past this one myself. The Government of Wherever controls one endpoint of transactions - the fiat end of things. They can make buying or owning BTC illegal, and that's that.
They may not be able to shut down the protocol - if torrents are any indication, even huge corporations with bags of money and armies of lawyers have so far been unable to stop the p2p distribution of media.
But they *are* able to stop the flow of fiat into the BTC economy; not just the government but banks and their ilk (who would presumably have a vested interest in seeing this fail) can do quite a lot yet to prevent bitcoin from becoming ubiquitous.
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:46:01

It helps to see the price fluctuations in % relative to current value (and not where at you bought / sold last).
Of course, a 15% dip is wild as fuck..
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:57:25
I wasn't looking at it with high enough resolution I guess -- the general movements are very similar (the major peaks and valleys hit around the same time), but the lesser ones don't necessarily match up.
@_date: 2013-04-27 15:19:50
Yes please -- roll it into a torrent if you can!

Sounds like you're trying to convince yourself real hard that you didn't lose your money. Well, you lost some portion of it, but not all of it, not yet. If you're a true believer in bitcoin, you would probably want to own as many bitcoins as you could, right?
So, if you sell now and the price continues to fall (which it will, in spurts, and in a slow and painful manner after that), you will be able to buy 3x or 4x the amount of btc you're holding now.
Just sayin'

You mean, the correction?
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:14:11
Oh.. because it was SO STABLE the past few weeks?
@_date: 2013-12-04 16:54:09
Well, that means he owns a ton and wants to offload it..
@_date: 2013-04-07 23:57:13
What's the point tho? They pay a ton of money to shut down BTC?
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:39:40
-1 for grammar

I really wish I had some bitcoins to sell you..

Pretty sober look at the situation IMO

Hilarious, given your username.
You are playing, because you're holding. If you were out, you would not be playing. But you're in.

Looks like it's perked up. If they break 5500, it would support the western rally.

The market crashes and everyone dumps fiat.

Because everyone calling it a crash MAKES it a crash, genius. That's how a confidence-based market works.
@_date: 2013-04-16 04:51:52
On the other hand, many more people know about bitcoin now, and some of those are your potential customers.
@_date: 2013-10-24 16:52:20
It's a time of transition, we still need them.
@_date: 2013-04-13 03:41:57
Looks that way -- even when there's no lag, the data is stale. Not sure of the interval, seems irregular.
Dick move if you ask me, doesn't help them against order-ddos via bots, but hurts legitimate traders.
But what can you do, obviously these clowns are flying by the seat of their pants, trying to get rich. Hope they don't fuck it up too bad.
@_date: 2013-04-01 17:42:02
Trading / speculation is the leading cause of the insane price volatility. This, above anything else, is what's hurting the fledgling economy. If a bunch of speculators get burned and leave, it's for the best.
@_date: 2013-11-24 02:28:34
Moves are quick, you gotta be quick on the trigger if you want to make a decent %

I came expecting an interview with Liberty Bit's CEO, was greeted with a bunch of monkey hootin' and hollerin' ... I guess that's how you guys do your show, and some people are into it, okay.
My attention span is fine, thanks, I just didn't want to waste my time sitting through gibberish with fading hopes of actually finding what I came there for..
@_date: 2013-09-12 17:25:31
Not necessarily, but they hold a promise of profit through speculation AND a financial stronghold if they succesfully scale up... so... 
@_date: 2013-05-04 00:59:53
Flatlined to shit, I presume?
@_date: 2013-04-11 08:22:51
It's actually the biggest dip in months. That's the kind of move that kills momentum..
@_date: 2013-04-11 04:36:30
people would work around by using multiple accounts and addresses. quit trying to control this thing and just go with it

What's to stop one from transfering BTC to Bitstamp and withdrawing fiat there?
@_date: 2013-04-06 19:13:03
It's the silence before the storm :-)
There's been a lot of buzz about BTC in the past while, and people rushed in droves to buy in. Now that most of those who would buy have already bought, the rush slowed to a trickle. Since there is no way to profit by shorting BTC (at least on mtgox), the price stagnates near the high. In a conventional market, you would see bearish activity at this point, but at least there would be liquidity.
Chances are high that the next volume we will see will be caused by a sell off -- volatile speculators who exit once they're not making 20% a day, all those who bought in without knowing and realize the BTC merchant landscape is pretty sparse, and those who bought in a while ago and are looking at ridiculous potential gains while the price teeters near the all-time high.
With all the new money that rolled in over the past few weeks, who do you think was selling the coins? Who in the right mind would be getting rid of them, if they're destined to be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars each (or whatever), right? Who are the "fools" selling them?
Same "fools" that will be buying them back for (relatively) chump change three months from now, that's who.
@_date: 2013-03-28 17:46:11
Yes I agree accepting BTC in exchange for service/goods will be easier than mining it, for the foreseeable future. Even if you're not bullish on it, you may accept it because it's so much more efficient as a payment method. You can change it to fiat whenever you want.
@_date: 2013-10-26 22:45:02
It really depends -- if BTC is falling against fiat, it would be profitable to borrow bitcoin, convert it to, say, USD, then exchange to BTC again when the loan is due.
Conversely, if BTC is rising against fiat, it would be profitable to be the lender.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:41:41
Looks like attempts to "fake" the price.. orders go through, show up as last price, but it's pretty meaningless because volume is nearly nil.
@_date: 2013-04-16 04:54:33
Yeah but they're assholes.
@_date: 2013-04-13 23:57:09
Sweet, thanks!

BTC has been through a few bubbles, and a few more are to come, it's inevitable. So far it's held up OK.
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:35:28
Yep, the entire process was straightforward, I think it took less than 24h to have CAD in my account.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:16:31
Seriously, this is gonna be how the crash happens tho. Sellers effectively DDOSing the exchange..
@_date: 2013-10-20 14:45:42
I thought this guy just wanted to get his money out, didn't sound like he was actively trading..
@_date: 2013-11-24 21:07:47
Yes, I do -- that's why I'm concerned now, seeing the huge spike in the exchange rate. It is mathematically impossible for the exchange to have enough fiat to cover a large number of BTC-&gt;fiat withdrawals. The only thing that would balance things out would be.. a drop in the exchange rate.
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:44:15
The choke point (legally, not from a technical standpoint) is the fiat currency.
People need to deposit/withdraw fiat somehow, and that's heavily regulated pretty much everywhere. While bitcoin promises to tie these inefficient ties, we're still moored to the old dock, so to say.
