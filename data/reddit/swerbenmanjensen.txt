She just takes money they give her, and she changes it out for bitcoin.
That said, no real personal communication, and it's totally inconsistent with what the company seems to do.
To me at least, it sounds like textbook laundering. I can't find anything specifically stating they're legit or not, but holy, it's not sitting right.

I don't want my friend to get screwed? There's personal damage associated with this stuff too.
Seriously, you sound like an asshole. I don't want your input if it doesn't contribute to my question, though I guess you value your lacklustre opinion enough to spew it out that ass you call a face - my rationale is diarrhea only comes out of that part of the body and that's exactly what your opinion is.

I doubt she's doing it intentionally, it sounds like that's what the co is having her do though.

They're getting money from an indeterminate source into their OWN bank account (from their erstwhile "employer") via wire transfers, which they then process into bitcoin to a wallet address of unknown possession.
It has no seeming relationship to the position my friend was hired for and it has no seeming relationship to the "company" employing them.
I have no idea why a first day employee would be given non-reversible transfers of over $3000 to turn into bitcoin, and if so, why the hell would they need an intermediary to do this?

I figured. Well, they've told me they're getting in touch with the right people about it. 
Though, those transfers are technically non-reversible, it certainly opens up a can of worms.

Sorry, I'm a bit paranoid and so I was trying to skimp on details without skimping on details, if you know what I mean.
The type of transfer is basically a wire transfer, they shouldn't be reversible.
