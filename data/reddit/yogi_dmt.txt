Good, Coinbase is garbage. As if the high fees, constant downtime, and general incompetence weren't enough.

I don't get the hype around crypto card. If you lose your card or get conned by a merchant everything you have on that account is gone permanently.

what's the point of the card then isn't that just an extra step to verif your tx instead of just using your phone to begin with?

I don't think all these forks are purely malicious scams like you all think. I do think some of them do actually want to try and improve bitcoin. However i also agree that if this is your intent, you should be doing that with a new crypto, and not trying to fork the original btc blockchain.
