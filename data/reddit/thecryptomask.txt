Today is the day when bitcoin became mainstream.

Can I just say louise linton looks like a total babe in these photos. This douche got really lucky with his trophy wife.

I would be happy to settle for a model S.

My dad is the CEO of bitcoin

If only everyone had this POV.

Exchanges are not regulated. SEC monitors stock markets very closely and goes really hard on any manipulations. But on crypto exchanges insiders can manipulate the price up or down for their own greed without the fear of being caught. There could be two reasons for manipulating it towards south.
1. They want to attract fresh money waiting for a correction and then it can eventually push up the price.
2. They want to create FUD so they could buy at low prices.

TRUST of people. Not just bitcoin, everything is valuable because people believe so. It can be by force (fiat money) or by common a belief within community (bitcoin). Suppose NASA airdropped you to the moon with 1 billion dollars or even with all of 21 million bitcoins, what can you do? Absolutely nothing. Because there is no one there who believes in your systems. Let's talk about our planet. If you go to a foreign country you get your money converted to local currency. Simply because majority of the population will only trade with you if show them the money they believe in. And if you are from a country like Zimbabwe or Venezuela, then good luck in trying to convert that money. It's all about a common trust people build on making things valuable so they can be used as a medium of exchange for our trades.
Now Bitcoin is valued because people trust it's a scarce, decentralized, immutable system but who decides current value? That is simply a supply/demand game. Anything which is scarce (Bitcoin/Gold), will appreciate in price if more people want it. Because there is only a fixed number that is available and people are willing to pay more to get hold of it. Anything which is not scarce and can be created anytime (Fiat money) will keep losing it's value.

Bitcoin exists only since 9 years. For how many years has this fiat fantasy existed? 45 years! Fiat was made to believe by governmental force and people did not have an option to opt out. Bitcoin is that option and I think Bitcoin'n 9 years history is much more interesting and impact then of fiat. Today if you are forced to believe in bitcoin by your government, it would be less imaginary. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 17:01:49
It definitely will. Reason being blockchains are disruptive as was the internet and they are going to be used everywhere. Unless you are not invested in centralized gimmicky shitcoins, you have no reason to worry. Stop caring about short term price and be long term greedy :)
@_date: 2018-05-23 17:31:08
Bitcoin is a game where everyone watches everyone so no one could cheat.
@_date: 2018-05-23 14:30:13
The answer is with you. If you have no other source of getting that imaginary fiat money, sell. Otherwise if you can  hodl for 4-6 months, it will be worth it I guess. But do not take any loans.

No matter how big or small, get off the debt as soon as you can. Being debt-free gives you the peace of mind and sets your journey towards financial independence.
@_date: 2018-05-23 14:20:45
You would actually never figure this out. Not even an estimate.
@_date: 2018-05-23 17:29:40
@_date: 2018-05-23 14:33:29
This video has the best explanation (Goosebumps guaranteed)
@_date: 2018-05-23 17:35:35
But you have 32mb block size. The greatest innovation that you claimed Bitcoin needed.
@_date: 2018-05-23 17:50:02
In case of bitcoin, it is not estimate, it's a guess :)
@_date: 2019-08-01 18:08:46
Alright thanks for explaining it briefly. My whole point of initial comment was that maybe BTC shouldn't be used for micro transactions. I think coins like LTC or DGB fit better in that use case.
@_date: 2019-08-01 18:10:25
Yes I knew thanks. When BTC was at $20k and mempool had 300k+ pending transactions, that setting of low fee will probably not confirm your transaction even in 24 hours.
@_date: 2019-08-01 15:48:24
Nobody would setup a lightening network for a random stall that that will not exist tomorrow.
@_date: 2019-08-01 11:16:23
Well the fee would keep anyone from using BTC.
@_date: 2019-08-01 16:11:05
Thanks. That's a good answer rather than downvoting like a dumbass.
Could you plz tell me if user still pays some fee? Like I think when you open and close a channel there's a fee involved. How does this work in setup you explained?

Made a hooker to agree for anal.

This is what bull market means.
@_date: 2019-06-17 16:10:04
Use localbitcoins.com. You dont need your friend.
@_date: 2019-06-21 12:54:41
Never do this shit even if you are 1000000% sure that your investment will go up.
@_date: 2019-06-25 05:18:51
The day  makes a tweet on it. Hopefully one that shows government is afraid of it.
@_date: 2019-06-17 16:23:10
Use someone else in your family to get verified. IRS is pretty anal in US and they might trouble your friend if its worth more than $10k.
@_date: 2019-06-17 16:21:51
Welcome to the fam. Be prepared to be thrilled. There are going to be wild ups and downs. Hodl on my friend!
@_date: 2019-06-17 16:03:20
India? Do they even matter?
@_date: 2019-06-21 13:42:18
Yep, ledger is the best one!
@_date: 2019-01-02 13:25:59
Bitcoin halvening is due in mid 2020. I would say whole crypto market may drop 15-20% from current but not any more. We should see bull run starting somewhere in mid 2019. 
@_date: 2019-01-02 17:37:55
You right. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 18:58:29
I am a resident in two countries and have tried it at both places for buy/sell. Never had issues.
@_date: 2019-01-02 09:45:16
You confirm that you have received funds and then you release them. 
@_date: 2019-01-02 09:26:43
Localbitcoins.com or any exchange like bitstamp, gatehub etc.
@_date: 2018-07-16 18:55:57
Read little bit of economic and history of money. You will realize bitcoin is an absolute gift to humanity.  
@_date: 2018-07-30 19:19:08
Of course it is
@_date: 2019-05-28 15:40:40
Ledger is one of the safest and most convenient. I wouldn't worry about anything else.
@_date: 2018-12-25 08:27:46
Bitcoin cuts the block reward by half in every 4 years. This is [coded](
) in core software and cannot be changed unless majority of network agrees to it.
Read [this]( for more info.

I do not believe you OP. Please DM me your private keys so I can verify your claims by just doing a test transaction of those 10 BTC to my wallet.
