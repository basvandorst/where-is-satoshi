Huh, tons of people go to Polo.  It's going to get to 10 bucks a transactions and STILL tons of people have stuck transactions.   That's not sustainable.  If lightning doesn't help with that then there's no point.

Ok so for me to send to them it's going to cost a shit ton of money but for them to send to me, they do it cheaply?  Help me understand how anyone is going to want that when they can just use another coin with a large block size.
@_date: 2017-05-20 03:49:59
Yep...then they'll stall again.  Jesus.

No, it doesn't help ME!  Why should I use bitcoin if I can't move my money around cheaply.  This isn't making any sense.
@_date: 2017-05-20 03:50:30
Well the truth is it can't.  Lol.

Low value coins will turn into high value coins and still have low transaction fees.   If bitcoin can't compete, it dies.

People still need to commit on chain.  You have to get your coins on chain.

Ok, so I make a direct lightning connection to polo and my coins are in my wallet how long?  Tons of people are going to make direct connections to polo via lightning?
@_date: 2017-05-20 03:50:17
...or move to a coin that can and easily.
@_date: 2017-05-20 04:40:50
It's not a shitcoin when the value is greater than bitcoin and transactions are cheaper.   Not much longer now.

So bigger blocks in a few months?  Lightning isn't ready in any wallets.  How do I get my bitcoin off coinbase or polo quickly.  How quickly will they have lightning and still it has to get on chain so how long does that take?
