Ok so kind of the manner in which I start using LN would most likely not be with a friend. I would probably open up a large channel (large percentage of my btc) with a larger lightening node (that I somehow have to trust) which connects me to every other node in the network? This would be an expensive initial transaction on the blockchain but then I can basically go about my business with anyone within hopping distance until I'm out of coin at which time I would close the payment channel, open another payment channel with more btc (if I can). Is my understanding correct? I get that it won't be limited to what I just said but it would make the most sense to keep fees down. The problem I see are balances in open channels and my initial btc locked up in the payment channel. These centralized nodes are going to need huge channels open to credit/debit. My initial btc locked in the payment channel means if I need to pay someone who isn't in a connected network, they either need to open a new channel or I do.

I upvoted you but often the inputs of a transaction increase the cost due to size significantly. And it is often unavoidable. A friend recently told me he had .2 btc from mining. To send that btc due to the number of inputs was .1 btc for a transaction. That is absolutely ridiculous.

even if it drops to zero, I'm 99% sure that people will continue to develop for it and try to improve it.  This is a never ending improvement project regardless of price.

What's funny is that even frequent known transactions i.e. Rent/Mortgage won't be payable through LN unless you have a huge bankroll when you open the channel.  If LN can't handle this type of transaction then all those transactions must be executed on the main chain.  I am pretty sure if we just consider that single transaction type once a month for everyone on earth, you are probably going to overwhelm the settlement layer often enough.  A bitcoin bank as you call it would then require that we have deposits with them and not directly on the main chain.  This is all adding up to LN solves a small problem incompletely.

Ok sorry GDAX where all the problems actually occurred. Limit orders are free and they pay the transaction fee to another wallet. Based on that Gemini seems more expensive.

I think LN works when all big players are involved. For example if we could get gasoline station companies to open btc LN payment channels with everyone then I think it will scale well.

Yep that's what I'm thinking. They are trying to figure out a back out plan. I will say that bch has considerable support. If those 6k coins sold at market it would only bring us down to about 2k. All of those coins are limit orders that are unlikely to be executed. I am wondering why anyone in their right mind would be placing buys a penny under. Unless at trade start we see that wall completely fade cause it's placed there by a bch whale. Ok now I'm losing it.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:27:42
How the fuck does a new person know? Yes I agree people should do their own research but the price is btc instills confidence. A lot of what you bring up is probably not something a newcomer would even know to research. There bait and switch comes from establishing a fork and then waiting a long time to push it and when they do they push it hard on all fronts. When I bought in the mempool stuff wasn't even an issue and transactions were still relatively cheap.

Claims against net neutrality: reduction of investment, there was growth in competition prior to net neutrality, deterring competition, large content providers have the ability to deliver content faster to ISPs but the ISPs must treat that information the same, prevent over use of bandwidth, potentially increased taxes, unnecessary regulations. See Wikipedia. Please read the arguments carefully. They are framed arguments that ignore free flow of information. The idea that these rules reduce competition is a falicy. Without the rules we would have the exact same players only in this instance they can prioritize data. What does prioritize data mean?  The �� is always in the details. These arguments never state exactly how the ISPs want to prioritize. Therefore it can mean the ISPs can prioritize on anything. Paid data could be transferred quicker, contrarian information could be transferred slower. These are all "could be". This is why net neutrality legislation is needed because constituents of the United States have no idea what methods could be employed by ISPs to "Prioritize" data. Sure some may be legitimate reasons to prioritize but none of the arguments against net neutrality address a legitimate reason other than profit taking.

They don't have to change. But in order to be more liquid an investor has to get back into btc. So when investors are afraid they put their alt back into btc which drives the alts price down but does nothing to increase btc value. This was a huge bear run.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:04:36
They are the same. Block size increase only delays the same issue. They are capitalizing on this weakness, the plan is centralization. I think part of the plan was to bait and switch a lot of people. The bch hardfork is a way to remove wealth from long time holders and brand new ones and present an offering to the banker Gods. Yes I agree BCH would work just as well but they are making this effort in such a nafarious way.
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:50:10
I'm still troubled. Yes it may work in isolation but at scale it becomes too confusing. Will my wallet automatically open a channel or do I have to make a decision to open a channel? If I have to make a decision to open a channel, I'll also have to decide how much I want to put in that channel. If I have to decide how much I want to put in the channel I'll have to know how many transactions I expect. Maybe I'll set up a channel monthly but if that is the case then won't most people be doing that also?
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:05:44

I'm not a veteran of Bitcoin but my understanding is as follows
1. The goal of Bitcoin is "ideal money". Please look it up, John Nash's theory unrelated to Bitcoin.
2. Value will be different in different parts of the world, therefore the trading with Bitcoin will have different rules. There are 100,000,000 Satoshi in a Bitcoin after all. It will not be based on the US dollar but the US dollar may be based on it.
3. I believe that things need time to mature. There are plenty of people out there ready to transact completely in Bitcoin (they're the hodlers). You can call them speculators but the majority don't ever want to convert back to their native currency.
4. Please see point 1. Please keep in mind that this is only a discussion of Bitcoin. Block chain itself has even further impact. If I could just invest in block chain itself I would. If someone knows how to please pm ��

Hello Catatonicman, this is the absurdity that is divisibility. It should NOT be allowed past a Satoshi, nor should it ever be allowed to be necessary. If one Bitcoin was worth $100m. This would make a dollar=Satoshi. At this point a chicken would have to considerably cost more than $6 at Costco. The smallest unit of dollars at that point probably wouldn't even be a dollar.

Think about it for a second. Your claim is there will be more buyers than sellers. Then how did it get down to 500? Your value set will change because if it went to 500 everyone would be getting the f out.

Who is to blame in this Ponzi scheme? Every goddamn one of us.

Hmm...bisq sounds cool. I just wondering if it could be used soley to transfer fiat to someone. Like completely bypassing the value proposition of Bitcoin.

I'm trying to follow your argument. "Adding Divisibility doesn't increase the price" What else would be a reason to divide? It allows more room to spend thus increasing price so that the newly divisible unit can purchase something.

Ugh...got me there. I'm not sure my other comment is wrong but this previous one was dog shit.

Thanks for this. I was not aware of the manipulation possible. I know he said that in stocks this is illegal but is this same strategy also illegal in currencies?

Why is the decentralized network not considered the third party?

I only have about 400 usd in btc economy. I'm slowly procuring more. If I only had 400 in the bank in USD, I likely would be holding it just the same. One day I will feel comfortable spending it. Probably when I have around 5k USD in it. I will ask for change, I completely agree with you there. Also any freelance stuff I will ask for btc.

Some entity will always control Bitcoin. The broad user base will never truly be able to trust this control. If the answer is everyone needs to be a core developer to use Bitcoin, it's adoption will be considerably limited.  Someone needs to update it, eventually the only people willing to update it are people who intend to make money off of it and thus we end up in the same scenario just later in the game. No one knows when Bitcoin will be at it's optimum development point. If we knew that, we would probably have already implemented everything. Development is never done. Even 100 years from now Bitcoin will still have bugs and new requirements to implement. Nothing is set in stone, even an immutable ledger. I believe in the current implementation. What I don't believe is that the current implementation will exist tomorrow. If it doesn't exist tomorrow, I'll be really late to the selling party because I'll have to find out with the rest of you lazy butts.

Are governments afraid or is the military industrial complex afraid?

Maybe I'm wrong but what it seems needs to be done is move to a paper wallet before fork. There is no telling how your wallet or exchange will manage the coin. Then if you want your money in a hot wallet or exchange just wait for directions on splitting your coin in a few weeks after split. May seem labor intensive but I think that is what 2x forces users to do due to the lack of replay protection and clarity from wallets and exchanges on what they are going to do. But I'm no expert.

Huh? Fmv meansa selling price for an item to which a buyer and seller can agree.

Yes being able to infinitely divise a Bitcoin means it will hold more value overtime, protecting hodlers from ever having to spend the entire coin. One day a Bitcoin will hold so much value that it will be worth more than every resource on the planet combined. And there will be 21,000,000 of them. Makes sense to me.

Will greed have any long term effect on Bitcoin? The value of something is whatever a buyer and seller is willing to agree upon. There is a concept of dumb money in Bitcoin, people jumping in just because they want to get rich quick without thought for what they are buying. These are typically the same people that will panic sell.
Everyone in this community would agree that the theoretical maximum value of Bitcoin is considerably more than what it is trading for right now. But that comes with maturity. The  current value at the current maturity level is trading between buyers and sellers for whatever the market will bare today but buyers are typically thinking about that theoretical maximum that Bitcoin is no where near the maximum maturity level. The risk is that the maturity never comes for Bitcoin.
Everyone, even in this community's, biggest concern is overvaluation. I just wonder if more dumb money hurts the long term maturity of Bitcoin when an immaturity of the coin is exploited.
Imagine two scenarios:
1) Bitcoin trades exactly for what its intrinsic value is for at the time (super hard to determine) and it somehow gets hacked.
2) Bitcoin is super overvalued (also hard to determine) and it somehow gets hacked.
In what scenario is Bitcoin likely to survive? Maybe both? Maybe neither?

The more I think about the system of money, the less I see Bitcoin as having the possibility of mainstream. I really want it to be but it would have to reach a saturation that would allow businesses to pay their employees in it to actually make your dream come true. You'll have to "cash out" to have your vacation because that business won't be fully Bitcoin reliant anywhere in the near future.

I too wonder about this. Can someone explain when the overall price moves up or down? Is it really based on just the last executed trade regardless of size? I guess in order to move the price up you would have to  buy up the sell side volume? In order to move it down you would need to sell into the buy side volume?

Yes, I was in the same boat. How do I create a paper wallet? doesn't that mean I have to get my private keys out of my wallet? Well no, the recommendation is to create a paper wallet completely off line and then using a transaction to send to the public key as normal. Don't use an online service as generating a private key and public key online means there could be a log and you have to put your trust into that service. There are videos online of generating your own unique keys. Something about flipping a coin 160 times? I have not done it myself yet but plan to.
