I hope she gets fired and blacklisted in any businesses that conduct any sort of journalism. 
Worst attention w ever. 
ZERO proof, except for her saying its HIM. 
Hope someone proves her journalistic incompetence that will lead her to get fired / sued and so forth. 
Seems that any journalist nowadays can just start harassing anybody on a "just cause i say so" premise. 
No mercy for her.

Seriously. Everyone should just ignore governments putting taxes on everything. What's the worst they can do. Put every single person that touches a bitcoin wallet in prison? Haha. Anyone who pays a single dime on taxes over bitcoins is just a moron. 
Taxes are a payment for services any given government gives. 
Now what service do they actually hand out?
NONE. 
Certain taxes are ment for certain things such as infrastructure and law enforcement ect. 
Road and transportation is in decline. 
More and more corrupt officers and politicians pop up like weeds and nothing is done about it. 
F¥€&amp; governments comin after our bitcoin transactions. 
This technology is made to get away from those corrupt manipulative lying bastards. 
Pick up your guns ppl. It's time to put an end to this dictatorship. 
What's mine is mine. Not whats mine is yours. 
Power to the people , Down with governments and banks.

Prove me wrong then with facts.  
Where is the given layout for tax returns stated? Where does it state on what it should be writen. 
Legal tax compliance is nothing more than the sum of transactions. 
It's nowhere stated in what form nor layout is deemed to be legal. Therefor as long as the given sum of information on transactions is complete and truthful it does not matter HOW its supplied. 
Ps: have done tax returns on beer bottle cork and napkins  before on several occasions (there is no law against it) "it's your own choice on what object you print your receipt as a business.  Only law to this affecting it is that Date / time /Name / transaction details have to be stated. (Even the order of this is not defined by law)

And do not forget to set up each miner on its own pool account (increases the collected data exponentially) as reason u state that it is the most efficient way to calculate your hardware efficiency. 
In my case they'd get thousands and thousands of pages. 
Thousands of microscopic transactions per minute.

Everyone who is is Bitcoin is harmful to it as everyone has his own agenda. The most pure and honest bitcoin er will always admit he/she's expecting to make a shit load of profit from it.  
As to them hippy tree hugging folks, they nothing more than liars. "Ohh i got into bitcoin because I wanna save the rainforest or save some starving children in Africa" what a load of crap.  If all these human-rights organizations and such cant even put a dent in world hunger or sum dead children in a pest ridden country then how would a Virtual currency ever be able to do it. People there don't even have an Internet connection let alone know what a bitcoin is.  And all helpful things will still have to be payed in FIAT currency as there are and will never be any raw materials that are based on the value of a bitcoin (at least not in our lifetime). 
I for one do feel the same as OP. Bored. 
Made me quite a bit of "currency of all sorts" with bitcoin but still far off from what it's suposed to be. Make me "richer"
So everyone stop this false advertisement crap about making the world better with bitcoin. 
I couldn't care less about what children starve over there.  It's natural selection that's all.  This planet has already too many mouths to feed that are not even capable to do it themselves. 
We all ants in an ant-farm, at some point we gotta make a bit of space so the rest can survive. 
Ps: downvote all u want as its gonna happen anyway. 
     Just all be honest to yourself "u know I'm right!"

Nothing happens as they can't force me to pay a dime. 
Let em try I say. 
Before the first word comes fully outa they're mouth they'll b staring down a shotgun barrel. 
My taxes on my bitcoins have been payed when I payed the import tax on my mining hardware. 
They can't make me pay a damn thing over what comes out of the mining rig. 
(U buy a chicken and payed tax on the purchase, now that chicken lays an golden egg. U also gonna pay taxes on that golden egg? Anyone paying for it is either a damn fool or just a sick patriot who really believes the lies of the collecting government "we do it for your own good" 
Bullshit. 
Clean and simple. Bitcoiners are in it to get away from the lies of these oppressing institutions and take control back over they're own wealth. 
Anyone trying to take it from us deserves nothing more than harsh punishment. 
Taxes are nothing more than blatant theft. 
Over bitcoins they can in no way deliver any services. 
Taxes are payment for services that any given government supplies. 
I serve myself with bitcoins and control my own wallet and transactions, therefor no services are given to me by the government. 
Taxing someone for doing his own work for himself = THEFT.

The Internet is not a governmental service.

Bitcoin "created to be decentralized and get away from banks/governmental institutions" being regulated by the very thing we wanna get away from and bitcoin holders here being happy with statements as "as long as its not being banned" effin ridiculous. 
Regulation is same as bad as a ban on it ppl.  
Open your eyes ppl. 
First we allow regulation , next will be taxation , and after that we back in the same slump that the entire planet suffers from now already with regular currencies. 
Who do you think is gonna "regulate BTC" (THE SAME BASTARDS THAT OPPRESS US NOW). 
@_date: 2014-03-27 23:10:37
For that they would first have to prove that it's deliberate. (Imposible)
All you gotta do is file all your taxes in that way. 
All they can blame you for then is being a nitwit with no skills of bookkeeping. (It takes a mastermind to do everything perfect yet to still look stupid). Best of all. It's ohh so simple yet elegant. 
@_date: 2014-03-25 18:27:13
Think we should find a way to completely ban UNKNOWN pools. 
They pose too much of a risk to the network. 
Could be easily a governmental institution trying/(going to) overthrow the bitcoin community to secure they're own agenda. 
If this pool growth trend keeps going its current course all will be over. And voila "the media will kill bitcoin with a final blow"
Once more the propaganda of nations will kill a technology that threatens they're very existence.

80% of everything i had got converted into bitcoin.
Even sold of lots of stuff just to get more BTC. 
Put most of my eggs in this bitcoin basket. 
Was 100% comfortable untill my Girlfriend had a emergency surgery in china and medical care is virtually Prepayed there. Now scraping by just to make the rent. At the moment I'd say 50/50 comfortable with it.  
I think Hanging in there will yield results at some point. 
Go Bitcoin Go.

The "motherland of communism" is in FACT really more free than any country under a rule of "democracy" I've said it a million times and will keep doing so till my last breath "democracy is just a made up word to control the dumb / weak and or undereducated masses" democracy is the real deal of what we get spoonfed by the media as Communism. Speaking out of "not only my own but many more people i know" 's experience. And I live in china already 14 years.
"Communist countries are freedom in its purest form as long as you don't try to start a riot in a park or on a certain square".

There are not even enough enough Jews to go around to hire for this immense job. 
All miners just set up each piece of hardware on a separate pool account.  
It'll turn the bible sized tax event ledger in to a freakin Library sized ledger. 
Go buy popcorn and set up your seat in front of the IRS building and watch all ppl jump of the roof out of despair after the first 1% of work done on the first 10 miners. 
"Wheeeeeeeee. Kasplattttt"

Don't cheer too soon.  
Once they find another way to squeeze money out of us they will reverse this decision faster than light speed. 
@_date: 2014-03-26 05:44:06
Exactly.  Pure brainwashing with false media and lies from elected politicians. 
I really can't grasp the fact that there are still people out there that believe in the "system". 
They fail all over the world in every aspect. 
They monopolize wealth. 
They lie / get caught lying / lie about ever having lied / and when that even fails they sweep it under a rug and shut the people that question then up by any means necessary. (Gag orders / slander / murder)
Sadly people are too retarded to see governments for what they really are. 
If they'd profile people like me I'd get sent to Guantanamo in no time flat and branded with the word terrorist. Just cuz I question they're motives and don't accept they're word for what it is they say it is. 
I fight back. 
So should everyone else. 
They can't do shit against it when the masses turn against them. 
"People, Start fight the brainwashing".

Impossible for them to trace transactions if u run all transactions thru Tor. 
For fiat trades its best to get an account in a foreign country.

There is no law saying i have to be able to work with computers to do they're job for them. All I'm obligated to do is supply the information. In what form is all up to me. 
For all i care I print it on restaurant napkins. I will have given the documentation of what they requested. 
How they process it is they're own problem. 
(Even a handwritten contract on a napkin is seen as a legal document)

Communists are 1st and 2nd cuz they don't lie about what type of governmental system they use. As opposed to our so called western "Democracy"
Democracy is just a different way to say Communism. 
All they did with it is rename it and package it with nice shiny christmas paper to fool the dumb sheep they oppress, to let them think they are FREE.

They have to.
Paper is paper and not all documentation is printed in a standard form. 
Therefor there is no program to read all printed materials for them.

Yeah. Patriotism is really just for the ones with no mind of they're own. 
The last few invasions in to the Middle East is pure proof already. 
And best of the entire story is , now they all complain about it afterwards. 
Every patriotic idiot doesn't even realize that all they do is screw themselves over. 
Serving with heart and soul, and once the job is done they get a reward in the form of a big fat boot up the ass. 
Funny thing is these patriots are even saying thankyou to the one shovin the boot up his ass.

Mainstream journalism ofc isn't dead. It's Real Journalism with truthful substance that's almost extinct.
Mainstream journalism is the kind we see every day. (Governmental/Political Propaganda)
The concept of Bitcoin is true freedom with control over your own wallet. {democracy is just a more fancy word with more lies to say Communism} And that's why we (almost) Never see any truthful journalism, as the flickering box in everyone's living room is the fastest way to spread they're lies and brainwash the undereducated/small minded/weak/poor sheep.
We need more journalists that do propper research into the story they're chasing instead of those "Mainstream Journalists that we have far too many off already "all they chase is ratings and anchor jobs"

There are no services given on bitcoins. So there is no way I'd ever pay a dime to a institution that oppresses the world already enough.
