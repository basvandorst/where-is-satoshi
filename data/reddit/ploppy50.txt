Gdax is by far one of the best USD-onramps for those in the US, along with Gemini. IMO it also has the best trading functionality. They are regulated, and "safe", insured, compliant, process free withdrawals, etc. Unlike most off-shore exchanges. And I've used many exchanges over the past 5 years, starting with btc-e back in the darker days. 
Gdax has been getting a lot of crap, however 90% of all of the current complaints on here are not based on any of Gdax's functionality, just on its listing decisions.

Your tx size is 226 bytes, this is the same exact size as a regular, non-segwit 1in- 2out tx. So, you payed no less than you would have with a non-segwit transaction with the same sat/b fee. Your address also did not start with a 3. Segwit addresses start with 3.
@_date: 2018-01-14 23:48:24
Correct which could one day mean 1.7mb blocks (at the expense of removing witness data/signatures from block headers)- if everyone cooperates and supports segwit. The other one upgraded with 8mb blocks instantly.
@_date: 2018-01-09 01:36:13
So assuming a 1-in 2-out average tx from a legacy wallet = 226 bytes, how many bytes would this same tx be from a segwit wallet?

You can start using segwit right now. Send your coins off the exchange to a segwit wallet you control.

If that were true than that would also apply to Bitcoin. Do you believe that bitcoin also had no advantages over litecoin?
Let me help you out, Bitcoin's POW algorithm is SHA-256 vs litecoin's scrypt algorithm. Litecoin has a max supply of 4x that of bitcoin. The biggest difference is litecoin has a block time of 2.5 minutes.

If the 3 btc is from one input, than the 2 btc you get back as change will be unconfirmed until the original btc confirms. However, you can spend the change with a higher fee and it will confirm. It will also have the effect of confirming the original transaction. This is called CPFP.

Exactly. And new users don't realize that the experience that they're getting is not the way crypto is, it's the way bitcoin is at the moment. 
I always teach new users on another coin and then show them bitcoin after I've explained how to read Johoes mempool, understand difficulty, fees trending up/down, whether to send now or wait for fees to drop, or identify if fees are rising and send now. How to do CPFT, how to minimize the number of inputs you have to keep fees low.
 Knowing that having many transactions causes more inputs and increases fees dramatically. 
All of this not easy to understand for a casual bitcoin user, let alone a new user. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:34:23
Gdax will always overpay the fee to get your withdrawal confirmed in the next block. I'm guessing as fees get higher we will lose this privilege just like we did with coinbase.

They started by allowing post only orders (limit orders) to fill the books and create liquidity. Then they went full live and allowed market orders. The market went crazy, up/down/up/down, then they halted trading and it happened to stop at 8000. they now are not allowing any orders (cancel only)

Actually, he is correct- a Stop buy order is what he needs. He is looking to buy at a higher price than the current mark, not a lower price. If he was looking to buy at a lower price, than a limit buy order would be correct.
eg: Current price 13500, Buy Stop order (aka stop market) @ 14500 means if the price rises and hits 14500, I will buy x amount at the next available market ask price. Getting a little more advanced would be a stop limit order (instead of stop market). This would only make a difference during a very fast moving spike or crash.
eg2: Current price 13500, Stop 14500 with limit at 15500 means If the price hits the stop of 14500 my order turns into a limit buy of 15500, I will buy the next ask price AS LONG AS it is lower than 15500. (which will likely happen instantly unless the price spikes through 14500 and past 15500 without enough liquidity to fill my order between 14500 and 15500.) As long as the market is not moving extremely fast, a stop order (aka stop market) will behave the same as a stop limit order.

Currently you will need 300-500 Sat/B to get confirmed in the next block.  However, the mempool has been rising steadily, so you may need more than that as new transactions are added to the mempool.

transaction times depend on fee. high fee will have a 10 minute transaction time. you need to wait until the mempool drops enough that miners start taking 200 Sat/B. the time it take will depend if the mempool keeps rising or starts dropping.

They are waiting until there is enough liquidity (limit orders) before enabling market orders. There are about 15X as many buy orders than sell orders indicating they may have set the price too low. The market will decide.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:15:59
no, the opposite of a liquidity spike. Liquidity was low. there weren't enough coins to supply the buyers, so the price spiked.

quote from the sticky post on the 1st page: 
"To reduce risk, it is frequently recommended to allocate assets by percentage, and rebalance upon large price movements. Eg. If you previously decided that you want to allocate 50% of your wealth in BTC (because you are a super big true believer), but BTC is now 90% of your wealth because the price increased so much, it may generally be advisable to start selling to rebalance your BTC allocation back down to 50%. I'm not saying that it is always absolutely wrong to have 90% of your assets in BTC or whatever, but it should be because you are intentionally choosing to do so, not because the price got away from you and you never really considered that you now have 90% of your wealth riding on one thing." -theymos
This is how I do it. And if my target allocation drops I add more.

The benefits are: 0 fees for market maker orders (limit orders) and 0.25% fees for market taker orders (market orders). You also have 0 fee when withdrawing BTC to your wallet vs coinbase withdrawal fee.
You can also buy using market orders for as little as $0.01 while keeping the low fee of 0.25%. Limit orders have a minimum of 0.01btc. but market orders have no minimum. You also get basic exchange functionality (ability to use limit orders, stop loss, stop market orders, conditional orders (fill or kill, etc).
As far as how they handle wallets. Gdax will keep your btc balance as a "number". It's not a wallet, but you can withdrawal to a wallet, or transfer to coinbase for free.
The only downside to all of this, is that you need to pre-deposit funds, and wait for them to clear before being able to buy. Whereas, on coinbase you can initiate a buy, and lock in the price instantly, and your coins become available after your bank transfer clears. So with Gdax, you need to stay ahead of the game and keep your account pre-funded before being able to buy.
"And when I see that GDAX offers transferring coins over from Coinbase, does it simply mean that they will be transferred from the wallet that Coinbase generated to my GDAX wallet?" Yes, and you can transfer back if you want.

A lot of it has to do with the current enormous fees that bitcoin has been experiencing. The only real use is turning into  speculation. Buying it so you can eventually dump on someone after it "moons". Everyone has been promised consistent gains as long as they hold, by most people on this forum.

Exactly. I have been using bitcoin for the past 4-5 years. The first thing I did was made a few different wallets and just... played with it... used it. I sent small amounts from one wallet to the other and magically saw my money appear on the other wallet, then 10 minutes later confirm. I learned about all the fundamentals, public/private keys, sweeping, full node qt wallet, lite wallets, HD wallets, seeds. I LOVED it. I realized what an amazing world changing currency it was. So I bought more.
Today using bitcoin basically turns off new users to crypto as a whole, they don't realize that this is not the way it was intended to work, they can't learn how to use a wallet with small transactions because the fees are too high. And this is when we need bitcoin to work the most, when its now hitting MSM.
As someone who has been using bitcoin for the past 4 years I have never been sadder to see this amazing crypto currency turn into a store of value coin that can't be used. Heck, even sending to and from a hardware wallet costs a huge amount, encouraging people to leave their money on an exchange.
I've begged for an emergency blocksize increase over the past month as I saw what was happening, but my posts were always downvoted so no one would know. Most people also would have seen that the most popular trade on shapeshift right now is btc -&gt; another coin. I can't say more or ill get the hammer.
It saddens me that I have to stop using bitcoin. I love all the wallets that I've watched develop over the past 4 years. If we ever increase the blocksize I will consider it a blessing and will start using bitcoin more, but its becoming clear that that will never happen.
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:12:51
Think about a stop loss (sell) set for $9,999. I'm basically saying that if the price drops below 10k, I want to sell, because I'm afraid it will crash further. Its limiting my losses during a price crash.
In the case of a stop buy, I'm basically speculating that If the price shoots up to a certain level, it will keep going further, and I want to limit my "losses" by buying in at a certain price before it goes higher.
Not saying that it is a good idea to use stops, just explaining the use for them. But many would agree with you and say: if you're willing to buy at 20k, you should just buy now at 15k.
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:02:24

Digital gold is great, but not when it's actually cheaper (and often faster) to mail someone physical gold.
Imagine how big bitcoin adoption could become if it didn't have enormous fees and stuck transactions associated with it, but delivered what was always advertised (and was always a reality up until recently). Can we at least agree to that? 
Imagine being a new user who hears about this amazing currency and finally decides to test the waters only to find out that they can't even use the $20 of btc they purchased. Big turnoff for new users.

You mean after 1933? Of course they don't accept gold. But that's setting the bar pretty low if that's your metric for adoption. They don't need to accept gold, they all accept cash, and they all accept VISA. We want them to accept bitcoin. 
And if bitcoin rising to $20,000 means adoption is increasing, does that mean adoption was cut in half during the drop to just over $10,000? Of course not, that's called speculation. Most of that sits on exchanges and has nothing to do with adopting the usage of bitcoin. It's not magic.

I see that you are new to bitcoin. This topic comes up all the time. It definitely would not increase by "100000x" like you suggest. 
Instead, why don't we spread awareness that you don't have to buy a whole bitcoin.
You can already set most wallets to display various denominations, mBIT, uBIT, Bits, sats. You can also refer to bitcoin in whatever dinomination you want, but 1 btc will always equal 1000 mBits. I can tell my friend that he owes me 10,000 pennies instead of $100, but it makes no difference in how much 1 "dollar" is worth.

It is a tough question but I'll try my best to give my thoughts. 
Basically because people before them believed it had value. I don't mean to over simplify it, but it's characteristics we're valued by some people early on. 
It's scarce, is hard to produce (I believe each btc currently costs around $1000 in electricity to produce. It has a limited supply, it's useful - can be sent anywhere in the world quickly. It's censor-proof, unstoppable, irreversible. These traits are probably part of the reason it began having value.
To be honest we would have to ask some of the first adopters why they valued it. At one point it had no value, people would mine it for fun, and then probably send some to friends for fun. Difficulty to mine it began to increase. Eventually, someone exchanged 2 pizzas for 10,000 btc. From there, others realized that btc had a small amount of value. People became willing to pay for bitcoin. Eventually someone set up an exchange where you could exchange Fiat currency for bitcoin. After that, it kind of snowballed to where it is today.
It's pretty much the same story as any emerging currency. Think of tribes that traded rocks- the rocks had value because everyone agreed that they had value. We currently can't dispute that bitcoin has value because people on many exchanges are willing to pay X amount for it. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:14:55
honestly, I would just eat the fees and make reoccurring buys on coinbase. Your other option is to keep a balance on gdax and buy when you want, ideally limit orders (0 fee), while topping off your balance after each buy (and waiting for your top-off ACH transfer to clear). Once funds are on gdax, you can make market orders for as small as $0.01 as often as you want. Market orders on gdax pay the same low fee regardless of size. limit orders pay 0 but minimum order is .01 BTC (~$100 at time of writing this.)

So, let me make sure I'm following you correctly. You hate "banksters" so much that you want bitcoin to loose 99.5% of its value.. Which is the only asset you own, So that you can sell all of your remaining possetions and buy more bitcoin? 
You sound like many others during the precious metal bubble who were SO bullish, that they would claim they wished gold/silver would get cheaper. All I can say is, becareful what you wish for. 
For me, bitcoin is an insurance policy.. One that I hope I'll never happen to need. Hopefully our economy and currency continue to provide us with the comforts of life that we take for granted. In the unlikely event that the dollar fails, btc is there to help a little bit. 
But hopefully, our economy doesn't fail and send us back to the great depression. In which case btc won't help much anyway.

Googling completed :) And with that, along with the explanation from r/phobosbtc, I get it now. Thanks.
From Investopedia:
DEFINITION of 'Long-Short Ratio'
A long-short ratio represents the amount of a security available for short sale compared to the amount that is actually short-sold. The long-short ratio can be used as an indicator for a specific security, but can also be used to show the value of short sales taking place for a basket of securities or for the market as a whole. The ratio is impacted by the demand for securities borrowing for short sale, and by the supply of securities available for short sale. It can be used as a market sentiment indicator. A large percentage of participants shorting the market indicates bearish sentiment.

I would say the risk of having your bank account hacked is around the same as connecting your checking account to any other institution that uses ACH transfers. Also, any USD on coinbase is FDIC insured up to $250,000.
Using a hot wallet (mycelium, etc) doesn't mean you are at "high" risk for losing your btc. Many here will keep "pocket money" amounts (eg. Less than $1000) on their mobile wallet, which they control the keys, and large amounts go in cold storage/ hardware wallet just like a savings account. I've been carrying btc on several different mobile wallets for many years straight... it's there everywhere I go, and I've been through 3 different mobile devices over that period.
Also, you might want to send the btc from one wallet you control and then to a second one, and then to the destination website. If the blockchain trail shows that each of your buys from coinbase go to 1 address and then straight to a gambling site, they may start asking questions. Most of us many here make lots of various transactions, and move btc around a lot, so a deposit to a gambling site here and there doesn't raise any flags. Other than that, you should be fine.
I would recommend checking out 2+2 forums or any other poker related forum, where they use btc exclusively for gambling. They might have more insight. GL

I get your point. But I really can't imagine coinbase risking losing their cash cow. A quick look at daily volume shows 20k btc on some days, that's $140 Million, with half of that being taker orders (vs maker) that's $70 million * 0.3% fee = $200k profit on just 1 day of trading and just 1 coin. They would not risk that for a small bribe.

I feel like there is still a lot of weak hands/ speculator $ in bitcoin that could leave at any second. Think back to the value of bitcoin when it was actually needed and used for commerce (silk road, etc). The usage case determined the value. Now we have speculator $ on top of that.

Just to give you another option: eBay. Not saying it is a good or bad option, just throwing it out there for you to consider.
Edit: after browsing eBay it does not appear that there are many (if any) listings for bitcoin anymore. Perhaps ebay no longer allows selling crypto and is taking down these listings. If you are quick, you can probably grab one before its removed. sort by newest listings and check often.
Under the search term "bitcoin to wallet". There are two listings for 0.01btc for $150 (actual value $70). about double the price

Copied from a post I made on a similar topic:
Gemini is one of the other major USD on-ramps (can deposit/withdraw USD). It was started by the Winklevoss twins, has a great reputation, and meets KYC/AML regulations.
However, I still recommend using Coinbase Pro (formerly GDAX). Either way, both gemini and coinbase will likely continue to add various crypto-currencies, and if you stop using an exchange each time it lists a coin that you don't agree with, eventually you won't be left with any options.
Coinbase is one of the most well known and respected names in the business, I wouldn't start messing around with exchanges that you are not familiar with over this. Like the saying goes: "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."

Sigh... I would think its assumed that we're talking about investable assets here? No one is talking about spending rent money on btc. 
Pretend all bills are paid and you have a certain amount of money left over that you want to invest in BTC.
The OP has described DCA, where instead of buying all that BTC at once, you spread it over time, investing a set amount every so often, as to take the average of the price of btc, and avoid spending all of that money at a bad price.
I see that you have indicated "Nah", which many would presume means you disagree with the OP (either that or you're a 13 year old) Care to elaborate on your response?

I think you have had DCA backwards. 
What you're describing is already the exact definition of dollar cost averaging. You buy a set amount in dollars per month, not a set quantity of the asset. 
From investopedia:
Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) is an investment technique of buying a fixed dollar amount of a particular investment on a regular schedule, regardless of the share price. The investor purchases more shares when prices are low and fewer shares when prices are high.
Now if you are talking about increasing the $ amount as prices fall and decreasing as prices rise, that's something different, called a (positive/negative) progression, but also presents a few problems. eg: Where do we start? $6k/btc or last weeks $7k? in other words, what is "low" and what is high"? And if I decrease the amount I buy as prices rise then how much do I buy if the price jumps to $50k? It's hard to quantify, you're forced to just base it on "what feels right", which is often wrong. Much simpler to just invest a set amount of dollars per month

I'm not sure about your specific situation but there will be fees either way. I can't imagine that btc will be any less. If the buyer is ok with sending crypto I'm sure he would be OK with cutting you a check? Obviously there's no escrow being used. 
Also, make sure you cover all your bases regarding your risks. Eg, if buyer claims he sent bitcoin to a certain address that's not yours, you might have a tough fight in court proving that you don't control said address.
If I were determined enough to make this transaction happen in btc I would talk with a real estate lawyer first.
One final recommendation, if you're having trouble sustaining the property, perhaps consider the implications of adding a 20k long position in btc.. 
Either way, what are the odds that the person buying your house happened to have an extra 20k in Bitcoin laying around that they needed to sell. interesting

Do not withdraw btc from a gambling website straight to coinbase. Its again TOS and coinbase may freeze your acct. Withdraw them to a wallet you control first, maybe send it around a little (between wallets you control), then send it to coinbase.
Yes, you can instantly sell the btc for USD and then withdraw that to your bank acct. On coinbase Pro- Taker orders (market orders) have a fee of 0.3%, while maker orders (limit orders) have no fee.
Make sure you use coinbase Pro instead of coinbase to save on fees.

From a basic finance theory point of view- the price can always be manipulated. Its just a matter of to what extent. For example, if you place a sell order for $1M right now, you will drop the price down a certain amount. If a lot of people conspire to sell large amounts of bitcoin over a certain period of time, they will "manipulate" the price lower. Same thing with buying. However the market is huge. Right now it would require a sell order of 30 million to drop the price of btc to $6000 on gdax. However that is just once exchange, arbitrage would bring it back up very quickly, along with buyer's capitalizing on the low price. 
Now regarding gov't/bank etc rigging the price: Keeping the price low would require selling a lot of bitcoin, but once that runs out it's over. I'm sure the gov't has a lot of  btc from the silk road confiscation and buying. But I think the population of civilians hold most.
If the gov't wanted to manipulate the price higher, they could certainly do that, as they can print as much money as needed.
One way the gov't could manipulate they price of btc would be if they made it illegal. This would affect traders behavior and would change the price. I'm not sure if this would be considered "manipulation" but it would have an effect.
Because bitcoin is a 24/7 Market with very little regulation and barriers to trading it should continue to act as a free market, the price should be reflective of the fair value of what individuals are trading at.
Regulation, like we see with the stock market could only hurt btc in my opinion. If you have ever signed up for a trading account on TD Ameritrade or the like, you will see why buying or selling btc is much simpler, and something anyone can do.
Re: futures. They should have little long term impact on the price of bitcoin because they are cash settled, in other words they do not introduce more btc into circulation and they do not remove any- they are a derivative.

Ok True, but like I said, op was clearly talking about unrealized losses. He said "obviously you havnt lost anything till you sell, Yada Yada but you know what I mean."

@_date: 2018-05-13 18:49:40
From a mathematical point of view:
US Population 325 Million * 1/3 *$100 = ~$10 billion. Current market cap of btc is $147 Billion. So that would be about a 7% increase in market cap. Nothing spectacular at first glance. To determine the actual effect on price would be impossible. 
*However, adding 108 Billion new users to the network would have a separate, exponential effect. Assuming that the price of bitcoin is proportional to the square of its total users (Metcalfe's law). In other words, its not about how much the population invests, but that they become new users of the currency. The effect would be huge if 1/3 of the population became new users of the currency.
@_date: 2018-05-15 01:05:55
Perhaps I'm misunderstanding your comment, but coinbase is the one giving them money, they are not going to run out of cash. Its the same as if a retiree was constantly cashing out living expenses from their brokerage account through BOA. Its still more money sitting idle in BOA account (even if only for a day) than if he did not cash out using their bank. And that idle money is what the banks want. More likely the problem (as described by other posters) is using a personal account for business purposes, or that they don't want to process crypto related transfers.

@_date: 2018-08-11 15:00:18
I honestly couldn't give you a definitive number. I have been in bitcoin for about 5 years, and I have learned and accepted the fact that no one can predict the price.
What I do know, is that if you look at a long term chart, we have just now approached a serious support level. Bitcoin could bounce off it right now and go higher, but if it brakes through then it could drop big time. We will probably see some action soon (just a guess).
However, I would suggest buying small amounts over a period of time (Dollar cost averaging). Buy a small amount now, then wait before buying again. Slowly, over time, you will build your position.
Hope thins helps. Good luck.

Agreed. Regulation is what we're getting away from by using bitcoin. Being about to send any amount, anywhere in the world, without someone stopping/freezing/reversing (regulating) the payment. Same with exchanges, where brokerage regulation means if I don't have $25k balance and I make more than 3 day trades per week I'm flagged as a pattern day trader and punished. Just an example among the numerous other regulations that prevent a true free market in the world of trading stocks, commodity's, forex.

Another advantage over Gemini is that Coinbase Pro charges significantly lower fees. For someone trading less than $25k per month Gemini will charge a 1% maker fee (limit order) and 1% taker fee (market order), while Coinbase Pro charges 0.3% taker and No fee for maker orders. GL

You're actively calling for a large group of people to get on one side of the market in order to impact the price. This is called pumping. If a big group of whales said "hey everyone, let's all sell to drive down the price." would you consider that manipulation?

@_date: 2018-06-25 23:18:00
It doesn't make money, hopefully. That's the point, its purpose is to try to mimic the USD- ('Tethered' to the USD). Many exchanges use it instead of true USD deposits and withdrawals to limit the number of regulations they have to abide by. It also can be used short term to reduce exposure to other cryptos.

Understood completely, just challenging thoughts. 
But at the same time, btc can be supported by using it. An individual investor pouring more money into it and sticking it in a wallet may pump the price up, but may not increase its chances of success.
I think I was just tired of seeing every post about price (which isn't even allowed by this sub, "post a comment Not about price" etc)
It's getting to the point where I think alot of people's definition of success is a high price.

The question is what defines "dead"? IMO Until the network shuts down (no miners or nodes) and is no longer able to process a transaction, it's alive. Doesn't matter the price. If price crashes to $1 and the network remains functional and is performing its designed function of peer to peer transactions, it's alive. 
@_date: 2018-06-12 00:55:59
I agree 100% with everything you said except: "Central banks messing with the price." 
I think its just speculation by the investors. Price is bouncing off the ~$6600 support level for the 4th time. Look at a 1 or 3 day chart going back 8 months and let me know what you think. Try 3 day here: 
I wouldn't be surprised if the price rose to $8000 and then came back down for a final test before a big move... Interpret it as you wish, even if as nothing, but an 8 month triangle is about to finish forming. idk.

That's a good question that I think far too many people don't consider.
for me, I sell at many points. Basically whenever my position begins getting overweighted and drifts too far I reallocate to my target position size.
And if the price drops significantly I buy to reallocate. Simple as that.
For others, I think it depends on what their reasons for holding BTC and what their goals are. eg: speculation, capital appreciation, wealth preservation, value, hedging their local currency, usage in commerce, etc.

OK, I get where you're coming from now. Without any fees, the market price would be lower since sellers would be asking less. I get the "there's no free lunch concept." OK, ill give you that- without fees at all the price could have been less. But in its definition, I still wouldn't call his order a fee. But that's ok.
But no one said bitcoin usage is a free right. He did not use any bitcoin, he simply bought it on an exchange. Now that he owns it, when he uses it he will pay a transaction fee each time to the miners that confirm his tx.
Either way, I see where you're coming from. But this is coming down to semantics of the word "fee". We can agree and disagree.

Yea when the mempool was empty i was paying 5 sat/B too, things are a little different now.. and 2 nights ago i had to pay almost 1000 Sat/B to get a transaction through.. I think it ended up around $11.50 for a 1 input transaction- thank god I didn't need to use multiple inputs or it could have been multiples higher.
Which brings me back to my original question.. at what fee point would you stop using BTC. $20? $50? $100, $1000 per input? Obviously if you were transferring your entire balance it wouldn't matter as much, but for regular use (transferring from an exchange to your cold storage after buying a dip, or sending a friend in a different country a few hundred dollars)

Well, regarding selling "tomorrow": I just checked on my account and I think that you would need to wait for the funds from the BUY order to clear, and wait till you receive your BTC before you would be able to sell it back. After that you could sell at any time and lock in your sell price. You would then need to wait for the funds to transfer back to your bank account. All of this could be avoided if you pre-fund your account. (deposit money into your "USD Wallet", wait for that to clear. Then when you buy you will receive your coins instantly and you could sell 1 minute later if you wanted.
If you do plan on buying/selling often, I recommend using coinbase's sister site: GDAX. It offers full exchange functionality (and much lower fees, and in some cases NO fees). And if you have a coinbase account, you already have a GDAX account. 
The only thing you can't do on Gdax that you can do on coinbase is lock in a buy price with no funds in the account. In other words, on coinbase you can buy bitcoin without a pre-funded account and they will lock in your buy price and hold the BTC until the funds clear. With Gdax, you need to deposit funds, wait for them to clear, and then you can buy and sell as much as you want.
As Xanga_17 said, when you buy (or sell) on coinbase, you won't have access to your coins/usd for about 1 week. So it may not be possible to sell them back while waited during this period. But once your funds clear you can then sell them back. All of this can be avoided by pre-funding your account with USD (or paying with a credit card, which results in much higher fees). Or pre-funding a gdax account.
Here are 2 videos explaining the difference between coinbase and GDAX and how to use GDAX to avoid fees.

So do you basically just hold BTC to speculate on the price? With limited use the price growth will be limited as well right? I mean the whole reason people buy BTC is for its use as a currency.. If its not usable, people (other than speculators) will stop buying it, no?
Although I guess if people stop using it, the fees will come back down..

Its hard to get a full featured exchange on a mobile app, I'm not aware of any. And even though coinbase has a mobile app, gdax does not. However you can use the API codes from gdax (or any exchange that uses API codes) and use them on a mobile app. I used to do this with BTC-e to trade from my phone.
I would recommend using Gdax with API keys on your phone and an app like ZTrader. Just like Ashun24 said, there's nothing wrong with gdax. 
Hope this helps.

Ok, so let me try to explain this. Lets say the OP created a limit order to buy 1 BTC at $7800. The price then dropped and GDAX matched him with a seller. He got his 1 BTC and paid exactly $7800. The seller paid a small fee but OP did not, as he was the market maker. Spread has nothing to do with this.
So, let me ask you, who received the fee, and how much was it.

Correct. Gdax is the exchange behind coinbase (and owned by the same company).  It's where coinbase derives their price from. If you have a coinbase account, you should also have a Gdax account. Although you may need to resubmit ID. Gdax will also offer a full functional trading platform, but you can always make a market buy which is pretty much the same as what you do on coinbase. I believe there is a full guide at the top of the forum right now. But there are also guides on YouTube if you search gdax no fee.

honest question- is there any evidence that a small group of individuals are "pumping" bch. Couldn't it be possible that people are just buying it? When BTC makes a huge increase is price do we call that a pump?

It would have been impossible (and still is) for satoshi to 'give himself' any bitcoin. The source code is open source for anyone to view and there is no code that gives the ability for him to have any more control over bitcoin then anyone else.

Copy/Pasted from a post I made in another thread*
My opinion: Open an account with coinbase and also with gemini. Upload ID and link a bank account with both. Depending on how quickly you are verified and bank account is linked do one of the following:
Option 1: Start with a small order on Coinbase that will lock in the price instantly (maybe 10% of your total investment. Immediately start a transfer of USD to Gdax (which is owned by coinbase and you will have an account for). A few days later buy another 10% on Coinbase. Once the money hits Gdax buy the rest over the next few weeks on Gdax.
Option 2: Start an ACH transfer for the full amount to gemini. Then buy a small amount every few days for the next few weeks. (The price will be locked in instantly and the BTC will become available once the ACH clears.)
Order a ledger nano S and in the meantime, as the coins become available to you, transfer them to Mycellium wallet. Write down your backup phrase and store it in 2 or 3 places. Once you get the ledger, transfer the BTC to the ledger. Store the backup phrase separately, and in 2 different spots.
The % and interval that you invest is up to you, do some research. In general, dollar cost averaging over a period of time will reduce your risk while allowing you to build your position.

OK I really hope this is just a joke/troll thread, but just in case...
Because you never want to put all your eggs in one basket. 
Even if you were 99% sure that bitcoin will not crash at this point, that is still a 1% chance of ABSOLUTELY RUINING your parent's lives. Ruining their retirement, possibly losing their home, losing their bank account or just losing their financial freedom during their golden years. Are you going to provide for them for the rest of their lives if you are wrong and BTC crashes? Do you have a place for them to live with you?
And bitcoin crashing isn't the only issue. Who is holding the bitcoin and how secure is it? (DO NOT ANSWER THIS PUBLICLY, IT WAS A RHETORICAL QUESION) What if you/they are hacked, infected with randsomware or any virus, have a software issue on your hardware wallet during a transfer, miss a letter in a btc address or fat-finger any transfer, set a 0 fee and possibly never get your bitcoin back, Exchange goes down during a transfer, exchange is hacked, a coin like b2x emerges and replaces BTC, or just made some dumb mistake and lose it all? All highly unlikely... but possible.
Your parents worked their whole lives to get to this point, at their age, any financial adviser worth a penny would recommend safe investments. BTC couldn't be farther away from anything safe. Do they have other means of income right now if they lose it all? At their age, going "all in" in an extremely risky, speculative, emerging currency is just a ridiculous gamble. 
PS: You say pump the price? your making bitcoin sound like a ponzi scam. 
And "Why the bad comments? I thought we were a community of holders?" So were you just looking for a pat on the back, and everyone to confirm you made the correct move, and are a hero for "pumping the price?" So this community is all "holders"? no bearish views allowed? no hearing the good and the bad? Like i said, even if we all were 99% sure bitcoin is going to go up, that doesn't mean you should go "all in". I'm pretty sure most in this community also say never invest more than you can afford to lose. Having to take out a mortgage on their home sounds like "more than they can afford to lose."  
My advice on how to start to clean up your mess: Have a good long talk with your parents about what I mentioned here. It won't be easy but its the right things to do. Find out if they have other means of getting by if they lose their investment. Find out what other sources of income they have and what the risk of losing those are. After figuring this out, sell a large % of the BTC right now and take your profit. Start to pay back the mortgage.
This is just my own opinion. I hope BTC does continue its trend and you and your family make a good profit. If bitcoin goes up to $20k you'll have more than doubled your money. But was it worth the risk? Cross your fingers.

This is the amount of transactions in the mempool that have not confirmed. Miners start at the top (highest fees) and work their way down. The lower it is, the lower the fees. At the top we are currently around 10 sat/B. As it digs lower, transactions with lower fees are cleared. By watching this page, you will know exactly the lowest fee you need to pay to get confirmed in the next block:

I am using a segwit wallet and sending to a segwit address.. what does that have to to with anything? segwit doesn't change the fee you pay, it just means if everyone uses it we can fit more tx in a block.
I'm using a setwit wallet on ledger nano s. I still need 550 Sat/B to get my transaction to go through. And that costs $6.01. not quite $0.20?
@_date: 2017-11-18 20:21:23
keep trying on coinbase or gemini. Make sure you are getting a clear picture of your ID. If you still have problems, contact them- i'm sure they want your business. 
If you are desperate and need a small amount of bitcoin, you could always buy some on eBay.

No one knows the answer to this. However, if i had to guess, I would say no, its not too late. Start dollar cost averaging in with small amounts each week over the next few months. Use money that you can afford to lose and forget about it.

Regarding GDAX, you should have made that account before buying, as it would have allowed you to pay a much less trading fee. However, if you transfer it to GDAX now before sending it to your own personal wallet (on your hard-drive or wherever), they won't charge you a transfer fee.
So yes, make an account with GDAX and then transfer the bitcoin from coinbase to gdax for free, then transfer to your own personal wallet that you control for free. In the future pre-deposit funds on GDAX and buy on there, limit orders pay no trading fee, and market orders pay a much smaller fee than coinbase.

1-4 - No fees
5) Depends if you use a market (taker) order or a limit (maker) order. Limit orders have no fee. Market orders pay 25bps/ 0.25%.
6)If transferring out from gdax there would be no fee. (from coinbase you would pay the current bitcoin netword fee, which varies depending on network load)
All in all, you are looking at a 0.25% fee from start to finish.
Edit: If you purchased from your boss, one of you (the sender, unless he passes the fee onto you) would have to pay the network transaction fee. This fee varies constantly depending on how many transactions are in the mempool. Currently, it might be around 30-40 Sat/b (maybe around $1.50?) you can view the mempool here 
If you purchase from coinbase, things will be a little different.
@_date: 2018-02-23 19:24:53
I was surprised that some people thought you would actually be able to withdraw bitcoin from Robinhood. "This is going to put coinbase out of business!" comes to mind. Imagine the overhaul that would have been needed for Robinhood to actually support buying crypto. How did they imagine the exchange would work? Or did they think Robinhood would buy it from an exchange and pass it along to them at a higher cost?
@_date: 2018-02-18 20:36:48
Transactions can be tracked through the blockchain back to you. When the network gets busy fees can skyrocket. Fees get higher depending on the number of inputs your transaction has. If you don't pay a high enough fee your transaction will get stuck. Price is very volatile. Phishing, and malware attacks can take your coin if your not careful. Bitcoin can be lost if you lose your backup phrase. Light wallets can go down. If you want to run your own node you will need about 150gb of storage space on your computer.
I'm surprised so many people here are unable to think for a few seconds and help answer your question.

Sadly, I have to agree. Its almost like this forum is one big "trollbox". I saw the same mentality at Kitco forums (precious metals) many years ago when silver ran up to $50. 
Let me first state that no, I am not mad about this drop. I stopped buying bitcoin around $1200 and sold about 3/4 of my position recently after price dropped from 5k to $4200. I saw it hitting mainstream media and realized that most of the quick rise from 1500 to 4500 was from speculators... people who don't care about the bitcoin fundamentals its benefits, its uses, but just want to be part of the next price double. $5000 was a big psychological target. Anyway, I locked in a huge profit and my position in BTC is now the same size as what it was many months ago when the price was $1200..  I want bitcoin to go back up and break new highs. if/when btc hits $10k Ill sell more.
With that said: A few points to look out for regarding the "cult mentality."
-Discouraging of profit taking, re-balancing one's portfolio, or having any concept of an exit strategy. Taking profit is shunned here. Reddit members are constantly bombarded with HODL!! DONT SELL as the price rises hundreds of %. 
Consider keeping a certain % of your savings in bitcoin and re-balance accordingly. Lets say you want your position to be 5% of your savings. If bitcoin triples in value, you now have 15% of your savings in BTC.. perhaps consider selling 10% to re-balance back to 5%. If bitcoin drops and you are down to 2% you add some. This way you are always buying when btc is lower and selling when it is higher.
-Acting happy that your investment is losing value. eg: "its on sale! yaay!" "hell, I hope it drops lower! woo-hoo" I saw this over and over on Kitco forums and its ridiculous. Not sure if they're trying to make others think that they aren't bothered that their investment is losing money. Perhaps they don't want to look foolish so they try to make it out that its a good thing that the price is dropping, perhaps they are trying to make themselves feel better. Perhaps they are trying to keep others from selling and making the price drop further. What-ever the reason, this feels like a very odd mindset for an investor.
-"you havn't lost anything until you sell".. True, but guess what, you havn't gained anything till you sell either. "you still have the same amount of bitcoin as before, nothing has changed!" funny you don't hear that when the price is rising. 
-"HODL!" or "Hodlers" (silver bugs called themselves stackers). Basically trying to pump their product. Do you really think everyone here is going to hodl forever and never take profit? what would be the point. Oh i get it, eventually bitcoin will take over and there will be no fiat... that's the same thing the silver hoarders said. that is a long shot... verrry long.
-Promises of huge gains: Mike Maloney, among many other big names (big name in precious metal investing) used to state that those who owned a lot of silver would be part of "the biggest wealth transfer this world has ever seen." Don't let hopes and dreams of becoming a gaziillionaire and greed blind you from realizing a REAL profit. 
-Calling for "FUD" posts to be deleted/censored. In any market you WANT to hear from the bulls and the bears. Why on earth would you want to censor one side of a market views.
TLDR: Don't let others stop you from taking profit or managing your bitcoin the way you want to. Have a plan for if the price doubles. You don't have to sell everything.. people here always talk about DCA in.. But never DCA out. that would have prevented this spike and crash.
Take my post FWIW. Honestly, if your position is only a few hundred $, who cares. But don't let others stop you from taking a nice profit now and then when your talking about serious amount of cash.

A limit buy order or sell order can be a maker. You won't pay a fee when you sell if you use a limit order. Also, purchasing bitcoin doesn't automatically make you a maker. if you use a market order when you buy you will pay the fee. you need to make a limit buy order when you buy to avoid the fee.

-Promises of huge gains: Mike Maloney, among many other big names (big name in precious metal investing) used to state that those who owned a lot of silver would be part of "the biggest wealth transfer this world has ever seen." Don't let hopes and dreams of becoming a gaziillionaire and greed blind you from realizing a REAL profit. 
-Calling for "FUD" posts to be deleted/censored. In any market you WANT to hear from the bulls and the bears. Why on earth would you want to censor one side of a market views.
TLDR: Don't let others stop you from taking profit or managing your bitcoin the way you want to. Have a plan for if the price doubles. You don't have to sell everything.. people here always talk about DCA in.. But never DCA out. that would have prevented this spike and crash.
Take my post FWIW. Honestly, if your position is only a few hundred $, who cares. But don't let others stop you from taking a nice profit now and then when your talking about serious amount of cash.

Kind of like trading a perpetual swap future.

Coinbase and robinhood are apples and oranges. Coinbase is an exchange where you can actually buy cryptocurrency. Robinhood will give you access to a derivative, kind of like a futures contract.

If there is no liquidity at a certain price, than the price moves up or down where there is liquidity.

Yep. Settles when you close the contract.

Of course not. Because you have a fraction of a bitcoin. The price of btc is for 1 btc.
Assuming current price of 1 BTC $4400:
If you buy $100 worth of bitcoin then you have .0227 BTC.
If the price of 1 whole bitcoin goes up from 4400 to 5400, then your btc increases by 22.7% as stated by another response.. (1000/4400 = 22.7%).
Your .0227 bitcoin * price $5400 = $122.72, a 22.7% increase on your $100.
If you buy $100 worth of bitcoin and btc goes up by $1000, you would then have $122.72 of bitcoin.

No. Put that money toward bitcoin if you wish. If/when your investment grows big enough you can always buy a hardware wallet.

Bingo. BTC was designed to be a p2p electronic cash system. Not a "hold coin and get lambo" system. :)

This. Create an account with both Gemini and Coinbase. Begin ID verification. Go with whichever one approves your account first. With Gemini you will need to link a bank account. With coinbase you can use bank or can also use a Credit/debit card I believe (which is probably faster). 
Alternate solution if time sensitive. Buy on eBay. (Research this first).

If that's how you took it, then your assuming that the OP is asking if $100 + $1000 = $1100? I highly doubt he is asking that question.
In that case, he might have well asked "If I buy 1 penny of bitcoin and it goes up by $1000, does that mean that I have $1000 plus a penny?

GDAX. They are the trading exchanged owned by coinbase (and they derive coinbase's price). If you have a coinbase account you can to go gdax.com and login using your coinbase credentials. You may need to re-verify your identity. Transfers between coinbase and gdax are instant, but ACH transfers take time as usual.

use their GDAX exchange if you need to stick with coinbase. Market makers are charged no fee at all. market takers still pay just .25% ($0.025 on a $10 transaction as opposed to coinbases old fee of 1.5%, and now $.99 minimum (10% on a $10 buy).
Only downside is you need to transfer the money first. you can not lock in a price instantly without fiat in your account.
