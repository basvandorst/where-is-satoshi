You can do whatever you want with your money, the bank is not obligated to help.  Find a better bank.

Any serious banking crisis and the govt will step in to make sure the banks don't fail and FDIC is not needed,   we had a serious crisis fairly recently ...

Worked fine, deposits were insured up to a certain amount, there was some amount of risk to any amount over

Yup, I remember in the late 90s how the old ways of valuing a company no longer applied.

No they don't insure against inflation, but there is a organization backed by the EU charged with controlling inflation, its currently too low.
@_date: 2014-06-17 13:20:09
Yes, I believe deposit insurance only covered up to 100k, if any one had over 100k in a shaky Cyprus bank they were taking a risk.
@_date: 2014-06-17 13:18:03
So are you saying that people lost money that was under deposit insurance or just that the govt thought about taking money from the insured accounts?  I don't make judgements on thoughts and plans only actions.
