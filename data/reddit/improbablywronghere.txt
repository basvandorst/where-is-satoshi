I’m a math major who just finished an upper division course in probability. Gamblers fallacy is exactly as I just described, look it up. Definitions aren’t up for debate. 
While it may feel good to use the history to make bets the reality is each spin of the wheel is an independent event. Gamblers fallacy is literally not understanding when an event is independent or not. 
Here is an example: if I draw names out of a hat and do not replace the name then each draw is not independent. Say there are six names then the chance of getting any particular name is 1/6. If I do not replace that name and draw again then the chance of getting any particular name is now 1/5. The history matters here. An example of an independent event is flipping a coin a number of times. If I get a heads on the first flip then what are the odds of a heads on the second flip? The 100th? It’s always 1/2. This is the same for a roulette wheel and that’s why it’s fallacious to think that the history of independent events has an effect on the probability of some future event.

That’s correct. An appropriate gamblers fallacy metaphor here would be that it has always rebounded from dips so it will certainly rebound from this dip.

Do people actually believe Bitcoin is going to change the world or something? This is a speculative vehicle shitting gains all over the place.

Plenty of coins [can be mined with ASIC]( I don’t know at what price point it makes sense to do that but that point certainly exists somewhere.

Or just switch to mining a more profitable coin.

You are absolutely wrong. You think if China (or whoever) rolls up to the US coast but stays in international waters we will let them launch what amounts to an ICBM with impunity? It would be an act of war. You aren’t launching rockets like this anywhere near America without permits.

Bitcoin is more likely to shoot up than down to be honest. Every time I try to day trade it, however, I get slayed. My new investment strategy is ABB, “always be buying”. As an aside I don’t believe in bitcoin or crypto in general but it’s a fun investment vehicle and I don’t see the price dropping anytime soon. 
For me right now I have an amount of money I would like to get into the market and I’m just buying whenever it seems right like right now. I did actually make a great trade recently in selling at ~5700 and buying back in at ~5300 then buying more coins today ~5190. I was terrified the entire time because every time I try to do that it just shoots up. Most recently I was contemplating a big buy at ~4200 but decided to wait till it came back to ~3900.... RIP

In this scenario they wouldn't kill you until they got the info.
