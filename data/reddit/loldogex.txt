i keep telling people in that greece should just adopt bitcoins instead of going back to the drachma but i get down voted hard
@_date: 2015-06-19 20:54:57
I mean, they can still print drachmas in their federal reserve and use it to buy bitcoins; since drachma is essentially valueless due to their economic situation, it wouldn't significantly push bitcoins too high but it would cause a lot of volume. 
But you're probably right that the masses aren't ready for it yet.

youd get ass raped from contango and management fees in the long run.

so what is the premium on the service fee of Magic compared to a normal pizza delivery?

never said amything about evaporating debt. if it was so bad that they cant sustain the euro and need to use the drachma or bitcoin, they woukd be bankrupt at that time.

I just saw XBT instead of BTC, so they are the same? Could you explain why they would rename it to XBT?

Would anyone know when this was published? 
I know this was posted here a few hours ago, but was this article from a few days ago or a few months ago? I don't see a date.

Sign up and create an account but they can't purchase anything b/c of capital controls, right?
@_date: 2019-12-21 16:59:04
They also shaft you on taxes b/c they suck at reporting and you need to hire an accountant to get it corrected so the government doesn't shaft you even more.
@_date: 2015-07-02 23:23:51
so someone can send you money through paypal and essentially store it there for you,*or does capital control still limits that?

I thought most Europeans don't even use cash? I believe my Swedish friends told me they all use debit cards anyway and only Germany uses cash. 
Idk, I hate reading Zerohedge b/c it's so biased. Can anyone shine more light into this article?

Well, in my head, im imagining ppl sit down with a sign with a number on it and they raise the bid every time they hold it up like the movies. 
@_date: 2015-10-27 14:39:22

Woah, I never knew all of these charities are accepting bitcoins. Going to have to spend a lot of time browsing each of them.
Thanks for such a clean list OP.
