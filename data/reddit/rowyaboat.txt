If this goes live and is solid, it is a gamechanger.  Doing away with all the forex fees when travelling would save shitloads.

As the article stated, the bank deserved a clobbering. 
But 2 billion dollars going into a New York State's coffers (a single state in a completely different country from where the bank is from), with a third going directly into the accounts of NYDFS is small town speed trap style justice on a massive scale.  Why should these agencies get the money? Is there transparency as to where this money goes? Does Lawsky get a juicy bonus?  Do the actual victims of the laundering get any restitution?  Why doesn't the NYDFS pursue cases against individuals involved in the crime or is the profit motive not there?

thats a 9% return. Even the best stock investors on earth struggle to maintain 10% returns each year. 
my return on bitcoins is 10,000% in 2 years. you will never get those returns on stocks.

Biggest mistakes: 
 - leaving $100k on Gox as it stopped withdrawals
 - Transferring my 5600 bitcoins to gox when silkroad exploded because I thought there would be a massive crash and wanting to hedge into fiat, ended up withdrawing 4000 bitcoins only from mtgox later on 
Biggest wins:
 - Selling 2000 bitcoins on the run up from $200 to $1000 netting $1.1 mill USD 
 - Getting 95% of my bitcoins/fiat off Mtgox before they imploded

Perhaps "Swarmcorp" could provide some blockchain evidence of this $720,000 investment? All I can find is a 4 page bitcoin talk thread with about 3/4s of the posts calling "scam"

Great site!
Question - if you host your own stream, does that mean things will slow right down if you have lots of people watching?

From Poloniex TOS:
"Although Poloniex takes several precautions to prevent a user from defaulting on a loan, the high volatility and substantial risk of illiquidity in markets means that Poloniex cannot make any guarantees against default. When you lend to other users using the Platform’s P2P lending system, you risk the loss of an unpaid principle if the borrower defaults on a loan and liquidation of the borrower's account fails to raise sufficient funds to cover his or her debt."
This is a massive systemic risk of margin trading in a high volatility market when poloniex can get DDOSed or crash, and then as the market tanks the borrowers end up underwater and default on the loan.

Here's how I see things playing out from here on: 
 
 - Some companies taking high price CC transactions eg. flights, concert tickets and some hotels which usually tack on a credit card fee offer a bitcoin alternative with no extra fee. Instead of paying $8 extra for your concert tickets or $10 extra for flight, some purchasers get bitcoins in order to pay for these sorts of transactions. 
 - When some significant number of people are paying with bitcoin, this will encourage more vendors to add credit card fees in purchasing price. This doesn't happen for most online shops presently because everyone pays with CC so it is factored into the cost. 
 - The increasing number of vendors which are charging credit card fees will increase the incentive for people to buy with bitcoin accounts. 
 - Feedback loop created in which the number of people using bitcoin and the number of shops accepting it grows exponentially.
 - Some banks themselves start providing bitcoin interfaces which allow you to directly pay from USD accounts on your phone to a bitcoin address at a universally agreed exchange rate with no additional fees. Banks which don't provide this service soon lose custom to banks that do, and are forced to match this service.

5700 bitcoins, haven't sold any.
you're all little bitches. 
there are now 2 viable bitcoin ATM companies rushing to get them out. 
bitcoin company creation is about to kick into high gear post the april media blitz and VC hype from disrupt NY. 
really slick gambling websites are coming thick and fast.. seen satoshipoker.org? obviously a little bit of $$ behind it and some good promos.. I think bitcoin poker will take a decent chunk of the US market before local legit companies make it through 
these are the factors determining future bitcoin value, not some spazzy $20 drop because of some twit launching a frivolous lawsuit. 
@_date: 2013-05-18 22:19:06
Also counterparty risk of storing fiat and bitcoins at exchanges.. given the high attrition rate of exchanges over the past 2 years you'd probably lose about 30% of your shit year on year.. 
@_date: 2013-08-18 05:47:11
Too ambitious I think.. 
Spending $30k + shipping on a giant ATM which might suddenly be made obsolete by some US law is a mug's game.. what a mission. 
The lamassu machine greatly improves access to bitcoins quickly. It is small enough that you can install it and if legal issues arise you can always sell it on ebay and post it to someone in another country.  There are about $100million per month going through bitcoin exchanges. If 10% of this was going through ATMs thats 10 million/month. At 5% fee - $500k profit per month.   
Once the cash -&gt; bitcoins path has been established and profitable, and lamassu has piled up a bit of cash, the bitcoins -&gt; cash path can follow as the concept will be proven to both the owners and users of the machines.

Tradehill is vapourware. 
For all the interviews and talk of "dark pools of liquidity" and "high net worth individuals" it was just a piddly exchange doing a couple of hundred bitcoins a day.  
Probably couldn't cover costs, and definately couldn't cover any sort of compliance issues.

This should be top on the reddit... very interesting insightful interview into the most important company in bitcoin
@_date: 2013-09-15 18:44:49
fuck you and all the other bullshit IPOs coming out 
why should anyone give you guys $7000 to do some nebulous prebusiness nothing??
it implies that:
 - you don't have any money yourselves
 - noone you know outside the bitcoin community will lend you $7000 eg. you have shitty shitty credit and all your friends and family think you're losers or just don't like you 
you also haven't shown any ability to do anything useful other than to start some marginally relevant poll 
you actually have to DO something before people will place any faith or money in you. Lamassu had a whole working bitcoin dispensing machine before anyone knew who they were. go DO something, show some initiative and impress us!

must wonder whether the recent bounce from $85 to $100 was the mystery buyer cobbling together the bitcoins to pay out the satoshi shareholders
@_date: 2013-05-25 08:26:00
stupid post.. 
supply does not "dry up" when mining gets competitive. supply remains the same. 
as more and more investment is put into mining, and it becomes increasingly competitive, miners will be forced to sell larger and larger portions of their coins rather than holding them as they may have done when mining was easier.   This will increase the supply of coins reaching the market and, if anything, push prices down.

There were other miners mining while he got his 1 million.  
You could have mined, if you knew about the project and realised its implications. 
I think Satoshi holding a mill is reasonable.  If I want anyone in the world to be superrich, i want it to be guys like him.  He would do something constructive with his megafortune. 
@_date: 2013-08-19 04:46:16
you have far less chance of losing your money by just taking 103% bets on satoshidice or just-dice. 
pretty much all these sorts of things crash and burn.  don't trust anyone with your bitcoins. the incentives are all against you getting your money back. 
@_date: 2013-08-18 03:59:22
Really like lamassu's style - came out with a slick looking fully working prototype with no fanfare at some gangster libertarian conference, have really just focused on getting this out into the market.  I have reasonable faith that they will get this out in good time - they seem like good dedicated nerdy guys. 
Meanwhile all the other bitcoin ATM's who spent most of their time putting out bullshit press releases are nowhere to be seen..
@_date: 2013-08-19 04:50:35
when the value of bitcoin skyrockets everyone starts paying $6000 for humble bundles and handing out $150 to strangers via reddit tips.  
when it crashes down again everyone holds them extremely tightly.
this is the total opposite of what is predicted.

Amazon gift cards which are purchased with credit cards and then charged back are cancelled. 
Therefore how does your service reduced chargeback risk compared with simply accepting credit cards?

a comparatively small amount - excellent news for gox - although it really leaves the question as to why they are being so useless in processing transfers if they don't actually have liquidity issues!

Man you litecoin kids are retarded
Adding litecoin would just result in a litecoin price with a 20% premium to BTC-e just as it is for bitcoin.  It is not even a temporary fix. And there is no way that mtgox should be wasting their time implementing litecoin trading while they continually fuck everything up in their core business.

Between this, the reddit and the mega announcement, I'm having a bitgasm. 
I love the simplicity of the design. I'm thinking these would cost maybe $1-1.5k?  Mass producing these in China and having them running all over the world in a franchise style system would really solve the "bitcoins are too difficult to get" issue.. 
If these are up for sale I would definately buy a few and get some friends to put them in all the cities near me.

What a total fucking asshole.  Get this idiot OUT of the foundation.  For all MtGox's flaws it has never lost client funds and runs the standard bitcoin exchange. He is undermining that with his shitty vaporware company and frivolous lawsuit. 
@_date: 2013-05-03 18:14:30
Excellent idea, and something that I would definately use all the time when travelling if the fees were competitive with traditional methods. 
And given that bitcoin's isolation from "traditional" banking margins ($7 international ATM fee + 2.5% on top of their normal shitty exchange rate) means that competing bitcoin ATMs will push fees down, this will eventually get cheaper than regular bank ATMs. 
Also the arguments about bitcoin volatility ruining it don't hold.  Bitcoin volatility occurs because at present we are in a phase of low usage, high potential and huge uncertainty.  As bitcoin usage continues to increase, uncertainty clears, the % of users coming on board each month goes from high (30%) to low (1-2%) and things find a nice equilibrium.

Can you point to case studies where this deflationary hoarding actually happens? 
I'm a medical Doctor and we have moved on from rationalism and the belief that things can be deduced from theory and embraced empiricism because SO MUCH OF WHAT PEOPLE REASONED TO BE TRUE TURNS OUT TO BE BULLSHIT WHEN YOU ACTUALLY TEST IT IN PROPERLY CONTROLLED TRIALS.

The elephant in the room that noone seems to address is that noone has any idea how much money was seized by the us govt in the mutulum sigilum dwolla account.
If this account regularly had its contents wired offshore, it probably wouldn't be significant.
If it were a holding account for large amounts of usd (during the april runup mtgox claimed daily deposits of 5-20 million usd) then its seizure has likely rendered mtgox insolvent.
I hope the former but the actions and (lack of) info from mtgox make me suspect the later.
