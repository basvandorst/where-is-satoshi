Reporting threshold is $50k. I didn't sell that much so I'm good! I did claim short term capital gains though.

So China banned bitcoin again? No way! 
@_date: 2014-03-06 21:59:53
Uh... no.
@_date: 2014-02-11 18:33:23
Nice!

I've always thought that Jed is Satoshi.

The credibility and trust lost by such an act could destroy Bitcoin. Ain't.Gonna.Happen.

Just wait until the fiat parade blows up in everyone's face. BTC will go to the moon, along with me, because Earth will suck balls at that point.

C'mon man
@_date: 2014-01-24 03:06:32
Get ready for a crazy ride!
@_date: 2014-05-22 02:05:39
I work at AB. Good to hear this.  Now only if I could get my 401k in bitcoin...
@_date: 2014-03-07 04:31:32
That makes me soooo happy!

I never would've thought the US (my country) would be so accepting towards bitcoin. Makes me think the government did have a hand in is creation. Not that it's a bad thing necessarily but still.  Wow.

He'll never come out now after seeing what would happen. I'm just glad he's safe and alive!
Also, really cool he still keeps up with his baby. He must be so proud.

Hmmm. Last time I checked I could do 10 BTC instantly but that was 2 weeks ago.  I went through the whole process and was fully verified. I am OK with 1 BTC instantly though. 
@_date: 2014-02-12 04:58:36
I was gonna change it at 11:59:59 on Sunday.  You blew my cover! :)
@_date: 2014-01-24 03:08:41
You can multiply your BTC by investing in altcoins though..or multiply your losses. BTC is volatile but these alts...wow.

There's no way that we'll know who Satoshi really is though after seeing how the media treated Dorian. What a shame. Very happy to know he's alive and has seen what his baby has been doing!
@_date: 2014-03-06 03:31:13
They do!  You must enable 2fa on your security tab.  
@_date: 2014-03-07 04:06:39
I think the best thing that could have happened is just this...stability.
Knowing or not know who Satoshi is doesn't do anything to the price because it doesn't matter. 
@_date: 2014-02-19 17:49:40
What in the hell could you possibly be investing in that would yield 2-5% PER DAY?!?!
@_date: 2014-05-22 02:08:41
This is about getting people into bitcoin. Handing someone a bunch of letters and numbers then telling them that it's money is too much at once. Baby steps. 
@_date: 2014-01-04 23:09:38
It shut down months ago...
@_date: 2014-01-24 18:22:11
Pete Schiff. He is just caught up with the whole "no tangible value" thing.  While I like gold,  BTC is a massive improvement while keeping most of the attributes of gold. 
@_date: 2014-02-11 18:34:14
You bastard!

February 22nd, 2014 15:52:08 $780 /BTC
@_date: 2014-02-19 17:34:09
Must be a scam
@_date: 2013-12-25 04:46:44
Coinbase must account for slippage!  If I want to buy 10BTC at $700 and the highest bid is 0.1BTC at $700 and 9.9BTC at $695, then the average will be about $695.5. The same goes with buying BTC via coinbase.
@_date: 2013-11-29 06:07:56
They say 1 million BTC but who knows. If so though, he just became a billionaire lol
@_date: 2013-11-14 18:01:04
@_date: 2013-11-21 18:02:20
They probably take slippage into account since you can buy 50 BTC at a time.
