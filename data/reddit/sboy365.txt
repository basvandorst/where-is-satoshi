Any idea how long this kind of thing has been in place? Would it invalidate a major plot point in the Shawshank Redemption?

You didn't deny having a stake in the sale in that reply. Are you in fact a party in some way associated with MtGox?

I'm not an expert on this by any means, but from my understanding of the network, everything would go on as normal, but slightly slower.

I was just thinking, given the deaths in the UK / Ireland in the last few months from tabs with rolex logos, if a dodgy batch of these comes out it could probably drop the price of bitcoin due to people not understanding it.

Ah okay, that would make sense. I was thinking that he was unable to access or contact the bank at all while he was in the shank.

I'm sorry I don't have a great answer, but I would point you to to help with your update issue.

thanks :D

You should look at the satoshi ddos thread from yesterday regarding the blockchain - you'd be better having them pay a larger amount upfront, like getting a balance. It does sound feasible to make games like that. And for your last point - you should google "Free-to-play Games" (there are lots) - your method just seems different from the rest (usually you pay to get boosts - here you get charged for failure (you may want to charge up front) )

You could use I.reddit.com or, for android, I really like BaconReader

It must be really hard for you. It's brilliant what you're doing, though. When I manage to get some bitcoin I'll try and send some your way.

Quick warning - at the current difficulty, you would most likely be wasting money on power

I don't know how to answer the backup question, but in relation to blockchain crashing or getting deleted, in this case they are not talking about the actual blockchain, but the web service

I understand most of how bitcoins work, with the exception of the different keys/addresses. Do you know anything I can read that would explain this?

Ah, okay, thanks for the reply, I didn't know anti homeless legislation existed. Just read the wiki article about it, and it looks like Scotland (ny country) only has laws that unintentionally homeless people are entitled to housing. Is the law in Florida one that criminalizes homelessness?

I only just got back into reading regularly a couple of weeks ago. Could someone explain to the moon for me please?
@_date: 2013-11-03 13:21:17
Thanks! I thought it my be, but I wasn't sure if I had missed something significant.
Definitely I'm glad I got back before blow stamps happened, that would have been confusing.

Is Sean's outpost politically sensitive? Or did you just mean for other charities? Sorry, I don't know too much about it.
@_date: 2013-10-25 19:53:32
Wow, that makes no sense. I can understand trying to move people along out of fire passes, but apart from that, it's terrible that they would do that instead of trying to fix the problem.
Also, there's probably a FAQ I'm missing, but I just realised your name isn't Sean, is there a reason for the name?
@_date: 2013-10-30 19:56:52
Thanks for the quick reply. Your post and the article really helped me get my head around it, and I think I get it now :)
@_date: 2013-10-25 23:12:33
That's terrible
I'm glad that so much good work is being done in his memory though.
