The key was decentralization and preventing any centralized authority from seizing the network. That can reasonably be interpreted as “anti-tyrannical”.

Well again, Bitcoin is redefining currency in a way. There’s no reason it can’t continue to exist only to be exchanged into local currencies for spending.

Well, if an actor holds &gt;50% of the network’s computing power, they will continue to generate the longest and thus canonical chain — and they can pick and choose transactions to process or exclude.

The price will settle eventually.

Retaining your value in storage is completely reasonable and one of the primary purposes of a decentralized “currency” like Bitcoin. The idea is that YOU as an individual actor store your value and reap the reward as opposed to leaving it in a BANK which withholds all the interest for itself.

I’ve been believing more and more in the “store of value” meme. Like you said, “money is safely stored in Bitcoin” and it is “far away from being practical for everyday use as a currency”. Gold functions the same, as do bonds, etc. but these are cumbersome in ways Bitcoin is not. 
Who knows if we’ll see Bitcoin grow or die in the coming years but regardless the value of a decentralized digital asset such as Bitcoin cannot be denied. 
Idealistically, it would end up like a global social security that we all choose to enroll in by purchasing the coin. I’m sure there are enumerable economic arguments that could be levered against this thought but it’s a start towards moving away from centralized financial institutions.

I like thinking about the people who spent btc on the Silk Road. 
An eighth of weed would have been sold for hundreds of thousands of dollars in today’s btc.
