You strike me as someone who would rather slap coins into a slot machine and pull (HODL) over and over and over.

I like them. They balance out the mindless HODL memers.

Doing it in crayon was a nice touch. That's exactly what I expect from all the HODL memers in this sub.

Wut? Of course I do. Are you really investing in shit without understanding it? Fuckin' Christ I thought HODL was a meme.

It will cause a rapid increase in HODL memes.

Where can I view CBOE BTC futures?

It's no use arguing with people who have $100 in Bitcoin and think they have skin in the game. It's easy to remain happily ignorant and HODL when you aren't risking anything.

Jim would not only have to invest lots of capital to pump Bitcoin to 20k in the first place, he'd have to find someone (or someones) willing to fill short contracts in volume high enough to make the subsequent dip worth it.

A different opinion: Since the value of Bitcoin is heavily influenced by investor confidence, Bitcoin futures will become a leading indicator of what the price of Bitcoin will *probably* follow.
