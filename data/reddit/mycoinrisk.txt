Buy bitcoin from coinbase- set up an account on Binance or another crypto exchange- send your bitcoin to your exchange- and buy alts!

No matter how drastic the market may correct, and the growth of bitcoin has shown to increase year after year, the future is bright!

I feel like everyone predicting these insane  prices brings a lot of chaos that is bound to happen. No one knows where the market is going, just like no one would ever predict bitcoin going to $19k from a couple hundred bucks.

Why do i have the feeling institutional money is manipulating the price......
@_date: 2018-10-18 01:06:35
Definitely accumulation time going on right now.... Start loading up on your favorite cryptos, the market has definitely consolidated over past few months and bitcoin has not dipped under the $6k mark, here to stay!
@_date: 2018-10-19 18:06:15
Old news!!! 
@_date: 2018-10-20 19:59:50

I don't think this is ever possible, if price of bitcoin were to ever be under $1k, everyone would just buy it back up to its original price
@_date: 2018-10-21 15:15:02
Bitcoin also doesn’t necessarily “stop” financial crisis. A crisis can be caused by many variables, and bitcoin could most certainly be a variable in the future.
@_date: 2018-10-20 17:04:23
Keep accumulating more bitcoin, and aim to own at least 1 BTC before you move onto any altcoins. Bitcoin is a much safer investment- and once you establish a strong foundation there is a lot of money to be made in this market! Long term!!! 
@_date: 2018-10-19 18:33:42
Yes. Yes indeed ��

As more and more people use Bitcoin on a daily basis, upgrades will come naturally to the technology-- we will find ways to scale bitcoin to a level where the masses can take part in using it as a store of a value or means of exchange. Also, the future of money as always looked as to being a worldwide accepted online currency, bitcoin very much can fit this role.

Bitcoin was no where near $15k in 2016, don't be fooled. No one knows where market is going to take us, or how long we may remain in a bear market
@_date: 2018-10-25 04:58:22
Its safe to say bitcoin is manipulated then. LOL

I agree with you. However, although bitcoin is decentralized, it can be easily controlled by one centralized power if they were to accumulate a great amount of its supply. Definitely something to be aware of in the future, with China currently at the head of bitcoin dominance especially with Bitmain, and US just getting started with financial institutions coming aboard

Do not be manipulated by others in this wild wild west... have your own beliefs and take risks
@_date: 2018-10-20 19:58:28
Bitcoin is your best bet when talking about the “best”. It has been the most reliable, the “king of crypto”, and looked as a store of value, especially when compared to altcoins. Also, the fact that the whole entire crytpo market follows the direction of bitcoin. And in reality, without the creation of bitcoin, there would be no other cryptos in the first place. Bitcoin is the best! Buy bitcoin before buying any alts
@_date: 2018-10-18 17:09:45
I think the US as a whole will began to panic within the coming years from lagging behind and lacking to be involved in the crypto space. With China growing in their dominance in the the crypto space, the Federal Reserve is going to have much bigger issues at hand...
@_date: 2018-10-20 17:00:09
Especially with institutional money coming in- prices tend to stabilize with large amounts of money being invested, probably why the price of bitcoin hasnt went under $6k these past few months....

One thing for sure- is the crypto space is going to be much more evolved after these institutions get involved.
