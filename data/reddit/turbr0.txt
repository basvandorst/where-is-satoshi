did you have any issues with the solution you pasted below (bitcoin-php)?

i looked into mycelium gear originally and it looks good, however i wanted to be able to create addresses and not be at the mercy of a third party (at least for the generation). This way my app does not go down if mycelium does ( i can still generate invoices and get money from clients)
as far as checking payment, i am reviewing options.  blockr.io , insight.is, blockcypher are what i am looking at now.

I will look into this... I am worried about reliability and uptime for blockcypher as if my web server goes down for an extended period the callback would be missed and it would appear as if funds were not received.  not sure if there is a cleverer way or a fix in place for this.

currently i am just hardcoding the "child" counter until i get it working, once it is working the invoice number/counter will get past in a post parameter to the variable

Thanks!! This works!

Not sure if relevant but i did find a link stating that bitcoin-php is a rewrite of the "old" bitcoin-lib-php (didnt look much deeper, but may help)

Wow, was just reading up on blockchain.info.. holycow, i will be steering clear of them. Thanks!
I am thinking I am going to write my own check against blockr.io or blockcypher. My thought is i can check the balance of the addresses stored in the database every 15min for 3 days (if they dont pay by then i will expire the order)

that was it, thank!
Also had a coding flaw
