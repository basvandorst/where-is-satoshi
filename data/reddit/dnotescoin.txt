I would ask that you define the problem we are contributing to and then explain how a dedicated effort to encourage and promote women in these fields would contribute to this problem.   
I don't want to take away from your point that there is some gender conflict and that it is a problem. You'll find our content is not divisive, it is encouraging and empowering, with examples of successful women and their stories, and we believe this initiative can help mend the divide.

HERo is non political and this is not identity politics.

The website is inclusive of everyone, a quote taken directly from the HERo vision statement "It starts with you. Join us. Together we can change the world for all genders.". The majority of the content is general and meant to help everyone in the areas we are focused: cryptocurrency, blockchain, technology, entrepreneurship, finance and fintech.   
Some of our other initiatives include:

It certainly is inclusive, that is part of what makes it so great!
I agree there is no plot to keep women from being included in cryptocurrency whatsoever. There may be some unique hurdles to overcome, and that's where HERo may be able to help. HERo was created in part to help encourage participation and promote awareness.
Thank you for your support!

You are conflating social constructionist mandates and equality of outcome initiatives with an awareness initiative to create equality of opportunity. If you are a follower of Jordan Peterson, that should resonate with you.

There's a difference between identity politics and targeted efforts to assist underrepresented groups. The former is focused on power, while the latter is focused on empowerment. Identity politics typically dis-empowers certain groups in favor of others. There is no political agenda for HERo. HERo isn't trying to advantage one group at the expense of another. Instead, it recognizes that all groups are advantaged when half the population is more engaged.

" There isn't a day that goes by that isn't flooded with news (term used loosely) of Bitcoin's demise and it's dramatic price drop over the last year. Investments should be looked at from a long term perspective, but that is pretty tough to do in the current state of the industry with it's disappearing ICOs, scams, marketcaps that don't mean anything, a pervasive 'get rich quick' attitude, and on and on...  
This is for the Reddit commenter and anyone else that has a longer term vision "
