This guy said it. Cloud mining has always been (IMO) the sketchiest proposal in the Bitcoin space. The hosts are telling you that they're doing all the logistics, but are betting against the profitability? Most of their risk is in ordering the hardware in the first place. Even if you see returns for some time, you will -never- know what the true overhead or the true mining returns are. And so many of them (who knows if the original intentions were honest) have outright broken "contracts" and stolen from the customers. 
If you want to mine on a small scale, do your due diligence, roll the dice with most reputable hardware seller and get the miner yourself. **However, I think you will be far better off buying the coins directly from the Chinese guys who are dumping them straight to market and running a cheaper operation than you could ever hope to.**

Totally depends on your relationship with them. 
I gave someone 1btc when the price was $200 as a wedding present with simple instructions on how to add to a wallet and use Gyft. I made a note about price volatility and suggested they buy the gift they wanted soon unless they wanted to take that risk.
They were lucky, as it happened to be right before the price spiked to $1000. I'm not sure if they held because it seemed like a hassle at first, or just because they saw the price rising, but they cashed out at just the right time, bought gift cards with most of it, were pretty thrilled overall.
So, it worked out pretty great, but I only did this because I knew the guy very well.

One of the best ways to break through this wall is to give them some. And I don't mean half a cents worth, like the ridiculous doge tips I see. If you give someone $10 (or hell, even $20) so they can see how nice it is to use a currency online without giving the other party enough information to steal your identity, it makes a pretty big impact.
I have never had a lot of money, but I did give my close friends and family several hundred dollars worth of Bitcoin, and it was almost magical to see how fast they figured out what I was so worked up about. I consider it an investment that raises my remaining stash's total value via the viral spread of adoption.

It's a meaningless metric, and trolls try to mislead people with it sometimes.
That's the "cost" of securing the network, divided by the number of transactions, NOT the cost for a user to send a transaction. 
I even saw one genius talking about how it was "increasing exponentially." Which was quite hilarious, as the network subsidy is fixed in Bitcoin, but the price of Bitcoin has been increasing exponentially, so the sour grapes crew is desperately trying to find some way to spin it in a way that doesn't make them feel so bitter.

Quite the opposite - the fact that the supply is fixed is what lead so many people to support this experiment and bring it to the adoption level it is at today.

But that's probably not where you are having trouble. Breadwallet should have a "receive money" button (sorry, I am not an apple guy so I have no way to run it.)

Plenty of rich people don't see the potential, and plenty of "not rich" people did and still do. Although, sometimes the money you have is representative of your ability to make good investments, no reason to begrudge them that.
To your point, though, the price is very low from a long term perspective, in light of the fact we have a fixed supply. If Bitcoin adoption is truly successful on a large scale (I feel it's already pretty successful by many metrics) the price will have to go up many thousands of times higher. And people will not be able to comprehend this drama about $300 vs $1000, just like people today probably have a hard time understanding what it was like to see the price go from a brief peak of $30 down to $2. 
The information is out there, and the % of the total bitcoin supply you can own for just a few dollars is staggering. So I feel like the excuses are running out. I had a lot of people tell me they couldn't afford to put in $100 in 2011. I saw them blow $100 in one night at a bar while I was drinking water. I saw them go out to eat every other night while I was cooking for myself on $30 a week. I can tell you, I am not going to feel bad in the least if Bitcoin goes truly mainstream and my personal investment pays off.

Again, I'm saying what I would do, not what you should do. 
But you have to weigh the potential opportunity cost against the 10% penalty. We don't know how much longer the ETFs and the OTC offering will be delayed, so if you think there is a decent chance the price will go up more than 10% in that time, it makes sense to take the penalty.

Eventually it will help bring more people in and increase upward pressure. 
Bitcoin encourages saving in your budget and in the long term, more merchant adoption means you can keep much more of your holdings in BTC instead of fiat. 
I don't think people should worry so much about a small selloff dropping the price by 2-3%. That's so incredibly minor compared to the fluctuations on a slow day 2 years ago, even though we basically no one outside the community accepting Bitcoin.
At this rate I expect that in 2016, a 0.1% drop will cause a panic.

Your use of the word "cost" is at best ambiguous and at worst, very misleading.
It's the cost for the Bitcoin network to be maintained (used as a store of value), not used for making transactions. That cost is technically paid by people buying/holding, and not people spending. I say technically because the gains of buying/holding Bitcoin for the vast majority of buyers have been growing exponentially, so the "cost" of the network subsidy has been negligible. 
That's why showing this not very useful "metric" confuses some people.

Dan: "How many people are using Bitcoins now, in the world?"
Erik: "So that's impossible to know, because again, it's private, so you can see that there are x million number of accounts out there, but you don't know who has what. Maybe it's just one person with a million accounts. But there are some reasonable estimates, because there are companies that provide bitcoin wallets. They have users and they can actually see the number of users in their system. Probably a good estimate is a few million people use Bitcoin fairly regularly, maybe 5 or 10 million **have ever used it**, maybe half a million are using it all the time."

At least most people who try and act self righteous and wise leave with their tails between their legs after their worthless "advice" is shown once again for what it really is. Of course, there are always new "experts" on the scene to repeat the same garbage.

Nope, trolls prove their ignorance once again. I paid with Bitcoin at a vendor and it was instant, because they were using Bitpay, and didn't require 6 confirmations, just like your bank card doesn't require confirmations for merchants and can reverse that transaction months later. Unlike your bankcard, though, Bitpay knows within an hour that the transaction will never be reversed.

* Meet in a public place. Hotel lobbies are good.
* Don't trade in large amounts.
* If someone tells you they are going to use the funds you are giving them for anything illegal, immediately stop the transaction.
* If someone tries to get you to talk about anything illegal, immediately leave. 
Edit: after a few minutes, a few more things:
* Make sure you scout out a place with good internet access in case the person you're meeting needs it - you should have a mobile data plan and reliable device. This should go without saying: be very familiar with the Bitcoin client(s) you're using, having multiple options is a good idea. You need to figure out the ins and outs of localbitcoins.com's escrow, too. I never messed with it, personally. 
* Secure your device in the unlikely case someone tries to steal it from you. Keep very limited funds on it in any case.
* This should definitely go without saying, but cash only, bring a counterfeit marking pen and check for the strip.
There is absolutely money to be made on the LocalBitcoin and Mycellium local trading markets, if you have the time.  Just make sure to be safe and keep your deals small, that will filter out 99.9% of the undesirables - although from what I hear, they are not common to begin with.

Many people didn't, and you are 100% incorrect here. When MtGox was hacked, trades using faked balances were placed in order to fill all the limit orders down to $0.01. These trades were not real, they were only made in order to circumvent the poorly coded withdrawal limits on BTC, which were at that time in terms of dollars. They were later rolled back, as well as the trades made in reaction to that.
It's easy to claim you told people to sell at the peaks, but the advice is just as poorly grounded as the advice given to people when the price went from 0.01 to 0.01, from under $1 to $30, from $2 to $15, etc.  If you'd followed your own advice, there is no way you'd even have a 100% gain, so give me a break.
Trying to compare Bitcoin to a stock shows you have no idea what you're talking about. Good luck to you, friend. One thing I DON'T tell other people is to "buy" or "sell." I just answer their questions.

As much as I appreciate the large amount of customers Coinbase has helped to make easy Bitcoin purchases, they do not seem to have a super reliable purchasing mechanism. Every single person I know who has used Coinbase has had at least one transaction canceled due to "high risk." This is despite the fact that the transactions were usually small, regular purchases from "verified" customers with no credit problems and no history of returned payments. The only thing that DID correlate with canceled payments was large price movements (both up and down.)
It seems like a stop-loss function is going to be pretty useless unless you can be 100% certain it will be executed. Is your company going to guarantee transactions?

They're still going to try to force you to use Paypal with Ebay, even if they eventually integrate Bitcoin payments. I'm sure they'd want to hold the payment and act as an intermediary...which may not be a bad thing.
This would still be a huge improvement over what ebay offers now - people complain about Paypal fees, but Paypal is not exempt from paying all the banking nonsense just like everyone else. They could eliminate most or all of the fee when accepting Bitcoin payments and you'd never have to worry about getting a chargeback 3 months later (which has happened to me at least 5 times in the last few years.)

He's got a good point. If you're just trying to find a place to sell out at, you will likely cash out long before seeing the kinds of returns in his examples.   But that's the difference between those of us who are trying to get rich quick and those who are trying to support a system that could make the world a better place. It's actually very easy to hold if you really  want bitcoin to succeed.

The price fluctuations are the LEAST of your worries selling on ebay. How about paypal reversals up to 6 months later? Accepting paypal for Bitcoin from someone you don't have a reason to trust is a disaster. You can't even leave these people negative feedback any more.

How is this not the  story of the day? Is it because they are a "smaller" chain and still relatively unknown?

No. The author of this "article" must have been using a jump to conclusions mat. Barry didn't say anything about the amount of USD that was bid.

That's something that changes long-term sentiment, it probably didn't prompt someone to buy up over a million in an instant. Someone decided to increase their holdings, and while there are lots of great reasons to do that, without talking to them, all anyone can do is guess at their motivation.

Not all transactions need to be on the blockchain. I think eventually as blockchain space requires more of a premium, the risk vs cost for offchain transactions will be more attractive for smaller amounts. I don't think Bitcoin -has- to be a great solution for microtransactions on top of everything else. But maybe they will find an economical way to do it, if so, great.

Slush - without getting into an argument about whether you have the best pool or not, I appreciate everything you've done for the community, so thank you. Having said that, re: 3 - you just admitted that with no evidence of any wrongdoing by him, you did exactly what he claimed. Having seen what kind of person he is (based on watching his response to his own pools problems and his behavior on IRC and btct for several years), I would set the odds of him attacking your pool at about a brazillion to one. He's just not that kind of dude. It sounds like you (at the very least) owe him an apology. Maybe that would help put this behind you so you don't ever have to discuss it again.

The distribution is extremely fair - people who took the "insane" risk of buying something that so many said "had no chance to succeed" are the ones that got (and will get)  the reward. The later on you buy, the less risk you take.
That being said, the already mined bitcoins are constantly being sold, and "spread out." On top of that, this distribution is much less consolidated than fiat money distribution, so if you think that's unfair, you should be all about this.

You may have misunderstood me. Sure, in the long run, the current prices are very low. They were low at $1000 and low at $100. But anyone calling price "low" relative to any other triple digit price is being ridiculous. The fact that we're above $100 is still surreal to me. The rate at which Bitcoin adoption has grown is incredible.

I would say go ask inbut I don't want to seem callous - however, this is one of the main things Bitcoin was specifically created to address. I don't have a better solution for you.
Maybe you have more options to pay your expenses directly (with your mining proceeds) than you realize. ~~Are you in the US?~~ Have you already checked out SnapCard? Or shopping with Gyft &amp; egifter?
Edit: Just read your other post that said you were in Canada. Sorry, I'm less aware of your options there. But I would do your best to avoid switching to fiat, you have a ton more options and interest now than there was a year ago. I would leave your in-person offers on localbitcoins and mycellium up - if it's inconvenient then add a fee that represents what the trouble is worth to you. Best of luck!

I think he was being hyperbolic to make the point that being "a slightly cheaper payment mechanism" is the least important thing about Bitcoin. Assuming you feel it necessary to move in and out of fiat for every Bitcoin transaction, (which is not necessary to eliminate volatility risks thanks to companies like Coinapult) you could make the argument that saving 1-2% is negligible. For some people it's a lot more than 1-2% and it's super goddamn important.  But making clear points is not Amir's forte.

Well, last night for instance, there were 3 sells of $100,000 of btc exactly 120 seconds apart. Then there were 4 large buys that bought it all back.
But even without watching the charts constantly, when Bitstamp has suddenly decoupled their price 30$ from China and Bitfinex, and most of the market moving trades are sudden, giant outliers, I would be wary. It's not usually beneficial to do that kind of nonsense, unless you are trading with fictional funds like the bots we saw operating on Gox.

If you are even using the phrase "climate change denier", it betrays that you are either being intellectually dishonest or you are completely ignorant of the science that has been done. It is not a binary thing. There is always climate change, with or without people. No one is "denying" it. Scientists do not have some "perfect consensus" on the amount of effect that human industry has had on the climate. Most reasonable people want to find out as much as possible and be cautious but not insane about it. I'm pretty sure Rand is in that camp, along with anyone who isn't stupid enough to try to divide people with inaccurate labels and false dichotomies.
