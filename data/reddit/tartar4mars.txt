Unfortunately I don't think you know what you're talking about: you can get the bill adder they use for around $250 on ebay, the rest of the electronics are about $170 off ebay, and the case...can't be more than $1000, as I said before. They've done breakdowns of these machines, its not hard to get a look at one inside. They're using an RPi with a 7" touchscreen accessory for it (less than $70 on ebay...)
Lamassu is an over priced piece of poo :)
Also, legacy bank ATMs are cheap as all hell...you can get them for less than $500 refurbed if you know where to look -- you sound like a Lamassu rep who hasn't done any research on the matter, which sounds about right as every time I talk to those guys they don't have a clue what they're doing.

Awesome! Do you know when the restock will be?
Also, do you ship stealth via t-shirts and merch?

I didn't say you needed to know how TODAY. I said expect this to be happening by the end of 2014.
There are already companies working on it.

Dealt with both Lam &amp; these guys and Skyhook customer service and delivery is above far the best I've seen in the BTM marketplace. Extremely professional, quick answers to emails, shipped next day after payment. You just don't get that many places in the Bitcoin ecosphere unfortunately.

Not to mention the two kids behind Liberty Teller have no idea what they're doing. Have you seen them trying to push people to buy bitcoin in front of their "vending machines?" They're worse than car salesmen.

As a customer of Lamassu and Skyhook, I would stay away from Lamassu and stick to the latter, or find one of the more expensive machines. Lamassu support is just horrible, massive delays, the guys behind it have no idea what they were getting into...I essentially equate them to the Butterfly Labs of the bitcoin vending machine world. Skyhook ships orders 1 business day after you pay. Talk about how service is supposed to be...

Yep, but not only that, his connections with KnCMiner are a big conflict of interest in my eyes. Brock PRIEST is a scary prospect for this...where's our veto?
Bobby Lee isn't the greatest choice either, but he's not that Brock Priest bad at least...

It just blows me away that people think these sort of things are the future and that they're going to make their money back buying them. The cost of the hardware for this machine is $500, the case at most could add $1000, and there's a $3500 markup. Now they're trying to tout this as an addition? 
People better wake up and stop feeding these companies that charge $5000, $16,000, or $25,000 for Bitcoin ATMs. It's not all that hard to retrofit and reprogram existing ATMs to handle BTC, which will pretty much obsolete all these companies attempting land grabs -- expect to see this happening by the end of 2014.
