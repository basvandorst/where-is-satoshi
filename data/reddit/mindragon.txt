And this is why I made the comment the other day as to how the insurance would be handled... The way that it reads is $250k per account holder on Bitfinex. The next question is to see if it was a covered cause of loss (e.g. Cybercrime). Does anyone have a copy of the Bitgo insurance policy with the Innovation Insurance Group?

To help make your bitcoin installation more secure by making certain attacks impossible to exploit even if a vulnerability is found, binaries are hardened by default. This can be disabled with:
Hardening Flags:
./configure --enable-hardening
./configure --disable-hardening
Hardening enables the following features:
Position Independent Executable Build position independent code to take advantage of Address Space Layout Randomization offered by some kernels. An attacker who is able to cause execution of code at an arbitrary memory location is thwarted if he doesn't know where anything useful is located. The stack and heap are randomly located by default but this allows the code section to be randomly located as well.
On an Amd64 processor where a library was not compiled with -fPIC, this will cause an error such as: "relocation R_X86_64_32 against `......' can not be used when making a shared object;"
To test that you have built PIE executable, install scanelf, part of paxutils, and use:
scanelf -e ./bitcoin
The output should contain: TYPE ET_DYN
Non-executable Stack If the stack is executable then trivial stack based buffer overflow exploits are possible if vulnerable buffers are found. By default, bitcoin should be built with a non-executable stack but if one of the libraries it uses asks for an executable stack or someone makes a mistake and uses a compiler extension which requires an executable stack, it will silently build an executable without the non-executable stack protection.
To verify that the stack is non-executable after compiling use: scanelf -e ./bitcoin
the output should contain: STK/REL/PTL RW- R-- RW-
The STK RW- means that the stack is readable and writeable but not executable.

If you have the public address, you can check your balance to see if it is still there. If it is after all this time, you are probably set.
Still, the 12 word seed is probably the weakest link over the long run. This is simply because it would be open to a dictionary attack by machines attempting to hack the private keys in the future. At the moment, such an attack would take a lot of resources. Each ten year period of time would yield more resources available for such an attack, not to mention the value of Bitcoin by then.
Now, if those words are also partially scrambled in some way, then this increases the difficulty of such an attack.
To wit:
Four Score and Seven Years Ago Our Forefathers Brought Forth a New 
That exact sequence (including capitalization) could probably be guessed by a series of computers now or in the not too distant future just by running a simple attack. 
A more difficult sequence would be
4FOUR4 $c0re an&amp;d s7even yea ago 0ur 4fore4fathers4 brought 4forth4th a new nat$io0n 
That sequence would probably be safe for at least 20 years. Hence the reason for my distrust of "brain" wallets.
The absolute and most safest true long (100+year) storage medium would be an offline paper wallet (trenzor, piper, whatever). 
Just print the darn thing, transfer to the public and then put it in an airtight storage medium. There are dozens of articles on how to protect paper for 100+ years.

Okay...the article makes a fairly flawed assumption -
If one assumes that 75% of the world uses Bitcoin and has Bitcoin-demoninated debt, the author assumes that an exchange from Fiat to Bitcoin is still required to pay that debt -- from TFA:


If the entire world (or even a good fraction of it) is using Bitcoin, the hell do we need Fiat for? I would be paid in Bitcoins and able to repay my Bitcoin debt -- not that I would ever want Bitcoin debts.
The article then goes on and tries to justify the need of a lender of last resort to fix the supposed problem. As usual...each of these FUD articles assume that the current Fiat model is not flawed. Rather, this article provides an informative reading as to why the current model is extremely flawed.

1. DAC's - [Distributed Autonomous Corporations / Organizations]( 
This is probably the greatest potential of the technology. For many products and services, it would no longer be necessary to have trust in a company in order to achieve a project or a goal. Anyone would be free to participate in a Corporation or Organization. In short, anything can be 'mined'. With nothing more than a [$25 Firefox phone]( anyone can join the global economy. When the work is completed, the worker is instantly paid. [The chains of warmongers would finally be broken with this](
2. Just thinking outside the box -- when [Ethereum]( is developed...College Transcripts / Credits could be recorded into a blockchain. For that matter, any training or objective that was completed for 'credit' could be recorded into a block-chain and openly verifiable. Those silly sealed envelopes would no longer be required. Transferring to a new university or technical institute anywhere in the world would then be made easy.
3. All manner and method of simple and complex contracts. 
  a. Real Estate "chain of possessions" can be more accurately tracked -- globally for that matter. Many of those "auditing" companies (such as Title Companies and whatnot) can all go away.
  b. [OpenBazaar]( is already well underway.
  c. Insurance can be opened up with this technology such that insurance costs go down while more accurate remittances would go up. Open Insurance is probably 10 years out but good god it would free us from one of the biggest scams ever.
4. All manner of accurate digital archives.
  a. Family records - Birth / Death records authenticated and stored
  b. Books / Collections of Writings and Photos / Whatever - A truly universal "Library of Congress" or "Wikipedia" that could survive just about anything.
  c. And more...
There is so much that this technology can do. Some of the ideas I mentioned are probably 10-25 years out but it would transform our society into a much better and more modern one. Universal Education, access to Health Care and an enjoyable job could be in the reach of all of humankind with this technology.

If you are doing a transaction above $9,999 then the complete name and address is required for filing a "Suspicious Activity Report" and the "Currency Transaction Report" with FinCEN.

1. Scummy -- I still feel that I was unfairly judged despite the approx 20 pages of documentation and endless emails over a period of two weeks. I have been verified by Coinbase, Circle, Uphold and 3 other regular banks without ANY issues.
2. Good point ...
@_date: 2017-02-10 16:27:28
What part is beyond shady?
1. I sign a contract with clients. They never asked for these.

3. I receive payment requests from my vendors after the work is complete.
4. I track everything in Quickbooks Online
5. I pay my fucking taxes

My answers are not shady and I can back everything up with proof. I do receive a request for payment via Bitcoin but I do not have an invoice.
When you request money using Bitcoin there is no 'invoice'. Try it on Multibit.
@_date: 2017-02-10 16:41:42
No it isn't. If I purchase Bitcoin and immediately remit it to a vendor, there is no tax consequence to me. I did not experience any gains or loss on the transaction.

I used Multibit, I follow the directions in the program to send a transaction. I was unaware that I needed to play this like a stock market game.
Nor did I think I would have to deal with hostile users of Bitcoin. Way to make this a welcoming place -- screaming at your users.
@_date: 2017-01-26 16:27:54
So I emailed...
I read from some of the folks on and that maybe you are a legitimate business. All I know is that I received horrible customer service this morning concerning my transaction and I was told that your company would absolutely refuse to do anything for me. In fact, they made it sound like I was a scammer.
I paid $72.00 for a Panera Card and I didn’t get a Panera Card. That’s all I wanted. Order 
I paid for it on 1/24/2017 using BitPay.
I never received any notices and yesterday evening I logged in and saw 1748131 was cancelled.
I called this morning and I was told that my account was flagged for suspicious activity. What the hell? With Bitcoin once it is sent I can’t get it back.
Furthermore, at no time was I given an option to provide an alternative payment method to save my order or anything like that.
No – you got my money and I have no Panera card!!!
So what will you do about this?

Here's a map of the cycle as it stands today. Let's take USD and JPY as a pair using BTC as a transmission method.
USD -&gt; BTC (2-5 days confirmation time)
BTC -&gt; BTC (1 hour confirmation time)
BTC -&gt; JPY (1-3 days confirmation time)
JPY -&gt; USD (1-3 days confirmation time)
At each point during the confirmation time you're at risk of exposure to a positive or negative currency event.

They just stole $73 of Bitcoin from me. I called their Customer Service and they refused to do anything about it. I could not talk to a supervisor. They never notified me that there was any sort of issue with my transaction. Their address on Google Maps doesn't show their business. They have no corporate registration filing in New Jersey and they are not registered as an MSB.

But there is no other way to transmit money reliably. But in this case, Circle (unlike the USPS) should INFORM its' users if there is a problem.

Consider this:
1. You hire a vendor to deliver a package to be delivered at a specified time.
2. The vendor fails to deliver the package.
3. When confronted, the vendor says "they're working on it"
4. The vendor fails to provide any recourse for the package. In fact, the package is still held by the vendor.
5. The vendor fails to accept any responsibility for the package not being delivered. In fact, says that it is YOUR fault that the package was not delivered.

1) Yes. I ended up using Kraken to go from BTC to JPY. It helps that I have access to a bank in Japan.
2) It works but it is higher priced (less Yen per BTC)
3) There are a few ... But they are hard to get to.
Japan is still very much a cash society.

There isn't any instant purchase for Japan. In my case, I was going from USD to BTC to JPY. So I bought on Circle (before they died) and transmitted to Kraken sold and then deposit to JPY.

Well...there are several sections of this story that I find deplorable. Perhaps Mr. Wagner is guilty of something -- or perhaps not -- but that is up to a jury to decide. Armchair jurors and random internet trolls shouldn't be the ones to decide Mr. Wagner's fate in this instance.
That said, the Civil Asset Forfeiture of his wife's business computers and client files, not to mention the Civil Asset Forfeiture of his daughter's items is quite appalling to me. Those items are clearly separate and distinct from Mr. Wagner's Bitcoins. 
Furthermore, the handling of the entire case as documented by Ms. Wagner seems terribly mishandled. Despite several clear instances wherein Ms. Wagner identified items as being distinct from Mr. Wagner's Bitcoins, these items remained in the custody of the Federal Government. It would not be possible for several of these items to contain Bitcoins. Furthermore, any forensic investigator could easily determine which items contained Bitcoins and which did not. Random pieces of paper, client files and so forth obviously do not contain Bitcoins.
And to take these items to the extreme such the government agents will cause a loss of income to a suspect is really, really appalling to me.
For those reasons, I reached out to and encouraged his office to investigate this matter and especially those topics wherein the government has clearly overreached their legal boundaries and are adversely affecting the safety and liberty of law abiding citizens. To wit -- how could a daughter's collection of papers possibly be involved in a government-aided Bitcoin plot?

You could store everything on a paper wallet (using Multibit HD) and for the words to the wallet, memorize a sequence of words that only you know. Something like a famous phrase mixed in with words that only you would know.

I personally think that it is on the radar screen of quite a few investment / hedge funds. It is probably just a matter of time before they move on it. I think a few of the investors are, perhaps, looking not to be the first, but perhaps the folks that are right behind the first to get into the Bitcoin investment opportunity. 
Consider this. There are so many billions of Fiat units of currency that is practically worthless. The moment that there is a way to convert large portions of that to a currency that is globally accessible... I am sure that each of us holding even one whole unit of Bitcoin will be offered entire bags (of what will be a future worthless unit of currency) of the stuff.
After all, outside of CryptoCurrencies, there is no other globally accessible, country neutral, medium of value exchange other than this.

Hey if you're looking for a fast exchange to trade on (XPM or LTC for BTC) MCXNow is fast. If you don't want to keep your funds there, that's fine. If you want to "slow sell" so that you get the best possible exchange rate (say LTC fluctuations) you can earn some interest while timing your sells. Not a bad deal.
@_date: 2013-08-12 23:37:51
Thanks for an excellent response. Bitcoin is so new...I'm hard pressed to find out ways of verifying a Bitcoin merchant. I think that there is a lot of opportunity for a company or a group or something to come up with ways of protecting the buyer. 
For example, Amazon does a great job of protecting the buyer. This encourages more people to buy from Amazon. 
I would rather that the Bitcoin community come up with a way of doing this long before the Government does it. Since there already is one lawsuit and probably more coming alleging fraud, unless the Bitcoin community does something, it is my genuine fear that the Government will be heavy handed in the name of preventing "Fraud".

I currently view Bitcoin as a prepaid credit card. I spend it and then replace it with between +10% and +20% of what I spent.

Prepare to be downvoted! I just got downvoted for saying that we should think of Bitcoins on its own and so what if the dollar to bitcoin is $1,000,000. 
But these people don't stand to reason. They are all about fiat to Bitcoin and the rise of the fiat value against the Bitcoin like it's another stock.
 Is it wrong to think that Bitcoin will eventually be stronger than a fiat such that the fiat will essentially be worthless? apparently thinks so.
Edit: I already have my first downvote in less than a minute!

It is not wrong to think of bitcoin as a currency. It is a currency. And it is a much better global currency than any other nationally printed currency in existence. If it was the global currency of choice, then anyone, anywhere in the world could conduct business with anyone else in the world easily. 
It would be one less fictitious wall erected by the 'powers that be' that loves strife and fiefdoms and one more way that we can all start acting as a global community of human beings.
And it would be one less stranglehold that the 1% could use to beat us down every time they want to steal our heritage.

Someone needs to tell that guy to spread his BTC order over time... Gawd. He could have managed to net an additional 500k or more USD just by spreading over time. What a waste.

Again I'm trying to talk about things beyond the purchase of a physical item. For example, SouthWest gift cards can be used for fraud. Likewise, LTC-Wallet is a case where 2fa and Escrow would not have saved you. The owner of LTC-Wallet walked away with a lot of money.
Given that no one knows anything about the owner behind the company LTC-Wallet, how are we to stop this case of fraud?
So my point is not how to secure my wallet on my PC or to secure my Coinbase or Mtgox account...My point is how do we stop these individual cases wherein someone of dubious background or perhaps they are working for the NSA wants to destroy BitCoin by escalating cases of fraud?
This is a very real and evident problem.

Actually, Bitcoin is currently extremely liquid. Many people will give you Fiat, Gold/Silver, Products and Services for Bitcoin. Each and every day it is becoming more liquid. This is why Bitcoin is rising in value.
On the other hand...The dollar is becoming less liquid. China doesn't want it to be the global currency anymore. Europe doesn't want it to be the global currency anymore either. 
Check your facts. There is a need for a global currency. There is no way that the RMB or the Euro has the ability to be that currency. Rather, a neutral, non central-bank backed, distributed computing currency like the Bitcoin is something that could be easily adopted as a global currency.

Right...Currently we've been thinking of mining value in USD terms. So if an ASIC miner no longer pulls sufficient Bitcoin to turn a USD profit, it is then "unprofitable". But that really means that it is unprofitable in USD terms, not in Bitcoin terms. If it is still pulling even a few .01 of Bitcoins, those Bitcoins could be extremely valuable later as Bitcoins become more scarce. 
Am I wrong to think that way?

You're awesome thanks!

Indeed. I sincerely think that the Chinese government sees Bitcoin as a way to push the dollar out. And the folks buying it like mad right now from China are gaining a significant advantage over others in the process.

Well even if someone could send smaller units of Bitcoins, even those can ultimately be lost. At some point, there will be no more Bitcoins available due to entropy. 
@_date: 2013-09-16 18:58:24
Very helpful! Thanks! I'll check into these.

Then maybe I'm unclear on the concept of how a "decimal place" can be added. 
For the sake of argument, perhaps you can explain what would happen in this scenario. Take block  Let's assume that the owner of that block (who got 50 BTC) was a solo miner and minted the entire 50 BTC block. Those 50 BTC was sent to his wallet. 
The next day, he walks out of his house and gets hit by a falling tree and dies. The contents of his wallet are now lost because no one knows his 108 character password. 
How would we divide Block  and those 50 BTC into smaller fractions such that they are now usable again?

Don't shoot the messenger? Perhaps I thought he needed refuting as well? People share Fox News articles all the time with the intention of them being refuted?

Thanks for sending an email to BitPay.
I have looked on  and I don't see ANYWHERE that I can contact them. It is all setup for merchants. There is nothing in there like:
"Are you a consumer having trouble with a transaction? Click me!"
Also, I sent to you two emails documenting my transaction with you. One is a order confirmation on 12/4 at 8:55pm. The second one is a Coinbase confirmation on 12/4 at 8:55pm. I think I was plenty quick enough.
If there is a "timer" on a transaction, then that timer needs to be clearly visible. I've only done a few Bitpay transactions and this is the first one that I'm having trouble with and in such a severe way. Hence, my concern.

Personally, I see this article as quite short and with no citations as compared to others that I've read. What does everyone else think?

A more likely scenario -- they want to see the end of the US Dollar as the primary global fiat currency.

There is a handy link above in TheSelfGoverned's post. There is one other exchange that I am aware of but they are under-capitalized.


That is something that we have a team on :)

I realize it might be 10 years out but that's why I'm asking about our thoughts on the future value of Bitcoin. Every future graph always relates BTC to Fiat. I'm asking what the true value of the Bitcoin would be in relation to a globally adopted Bitcoin economy. What would that look like and how would we determine value at that point? 
@_date: 2013-11-12 20:52:16
