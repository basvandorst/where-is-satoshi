How come you've only added a few tokens? I've played around with etherscan and coinmarketcap APIs and you can easily make this automatic I think. I doesn't make sense for me to have to manually select tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, you can easily get all the data on each wallet.
In regards to NEO, have you found any APIs that can tell you token amounts? I've only found APIs that return GAS and NEO amounts.

I'm from Slovenia and was talking to my mom about this whole thing and after a few days she Skypes me and asks how is "bitkonj" doing. _konj_ in Slovenian means horse, but the pronunciation is almost the same (the last the sounds are switched).

There are. Bitcoin goes to the 8th decimal and a satoshi is that 8th dacimal.

What exactly is that supposed to mean? Why are you comparing a currency value to an exchange rate?
The number you calculated, though, is an satoshi/USD exchange rate: 1 sat = ~$0.0000325143 (of course probably out of date by now). I, however, would more likely use the reverse exchange rate of 30755 satoshis to 1 USD.
