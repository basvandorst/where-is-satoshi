sorry about that. sounds more of a loss of coins instead of bad investments.

1.5 bitcoin is all that is left of that 600 am I right?

Most of the companies were in the bubble never rose. People lost some good money there. Even the early AMZN investors shorted their stock.

Also the individual, many, wallets' balance is also being moved. It would be a huge cost to do such a move.
And is blowing up with accusation of hacks for hours but no response from nicehash.

pretty sure it is.

will you pay me 0.01 bitcoins that I've lost if it is stolen?

That's how little Jamie lost his arm.

oh my gawd.
I didn't even know pirate bay was online!
I was even thinking about it a day ago how my life was impacted of its disappear. shit.
@_date: 2017-08-01 21:36:16
I knew that and kept majority of my bitcoins in pocket. still if it is 3.5% daily for 20 days, it is insane. If it can be cancelled, only explanation should be somebody forgot to cancel. It feels like stealing lol
@_date: 2017-08-01 21:52:53
although I asked the question, I actually read that part and it seems there is no risk (as you said other than polo taking your money)
let's say you have 100 btc in your margin trading account. you can borrow 150 more, now each btc you would lose in a normal trade is multiplied by 2.5, then after your balance is below some amount there is something called forced liquidation where polo takes your money to exchange and pays everyone with the interest up until that point.
@_date: 2017-08-01 21:43:33
it wasnt like that yesterday. that's when people put 3-4% 60 day loans. thats why I was asking if I'm actually going to be paid at that rate.
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:03:57
@_date: 2017-08-01 21:26:22
turns out it wasn't 5% but 3.5% is still a great number.
If the borrower holds on for 20 days it should yield 98% returns.

That's the best advice. Maybe I'd go a bit stronger on the emergency fund.

You have done some great job for a 14 year old. Do not worry about not holding bitcoins earlier. You have learned some great things and still made some money off it. Worrying about the investments you didnt make without any info about the asset is like being sad about not correctly guessing last month's lottery numbers.
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:15:51
no problem. reddit has a reminder bot. we can talk about it in a week.

Thank you, year or so ago there was an attempt to take over our government, and everybody was running to atm's in case their money were to be seized. Me and my fiancee were just tagging along them without any haste. And bitcoin wasnt even 1000 at the time and I know it was something good to have and not something to be panic sold.

What are your thoughts on people who buys gold and holds it to diversify their assets? What about the people who buys more than one house, even tho they definitely do not need any other house? Wouldn't that be viable for them to buy some bitcoin on the side?

There is not much difference from anywhere around the world. The fact the it is the bridge between Europe and Asia puts us in a delicate position. We got affected most by the crisis in Syria. Being open to most of countries unlike Europe makes it not the safest place TBH.
It was a secular country but now it is diminishing with the current government views. I am not going to comment on political things. It is delicate...like North Korea delicate. That is one of the reasons that made me realize bitcoin is an important asset.
About the economy, since I wanna move to US, I am going to compare it to US:
Good things: 
Education is mostly free. A lot of government funded universities not all of them have good education but some of them do.
Inflation is a big pain in the ass. You can get up to 14% yearly interest on your Turkish liras. Most of the time BTC loses value against USD, it does not against TRY. I feel like it is a safe investment.
At the time of the coup, the TRY was losing value against USD,EUR etc. and goverment was calling people to convert their foreign currencies to TRY. This call got so big that I seriously thought they were gonna seize the foreign funds in the banks and cause a catastrophe. Many people still have that feeling and the bitcoin knowledge is growing.
But yea all in all the country is not in a very bad shape but definitely cannot count on that.

They may take advantage of broke people to multiply their fortune. This may or may not be a bad thing. But if they are literally sitting around doing nothing (even taking advantage of people is a skill), a big fish is going to eat them with a new technology that they do not understand or cannot afford to hire people to understand it for them.

Can't upvote enough and I am not anti bitcoin cash.

It kinda depends on your financial situation. You did not give much info about your savings etc. But you may keep 10-15% of your savings in crypto form

It's really scary that all of your holdings can be stolen in a blink of an eye if you have irresponsibly told someone. Don't you ever fear some of the people you have mentioned bitcoin will come hunting for your coins?

can someone explain why segwit adoption is so low? and is it bad news?

thank you, lol
@_date: 2017-10-29 14:49:56
I meant hunting as in physical hunt. Hunting you down, torturing you etc.

Also I do believe you have to have a "real" profession. I am against to people who see hodling and getting rich as a way of making money or surviving in the world. You need to have a real world skill.
Just sitting around doing nothing will cripple the economy and no matter how non-inflamatory bitcoin is, it will be taken away from you by the inflation monster. No matter what you do, if there is inertia there will be inflation. How do you avoid that? You keep moving. Not by moving your coins but moving yourself, by learning things and staying on top of things.

This story just represents every great thing about bitcoin. There is no other way of feeling your savings are safe no matter how powerful the bad guys are. One day, somewhere safe, you're gonna spell out the twelve words you've memorized and it'll all be fine.
