Here is the process:
0) You must have a very very old wallet. Recent electrum versions won't work.
1) You use the python extract scrypt to extract the first 32 bytes of your encrypted seed. The remaining 32 bytes are safely stored on your pc, and I have no way to access them. Even if I cracked the password I would still need the remaining 32 bytes to access the money. Since that 2^(32*8)  = 1e77 it's really unfeasible to do anything without your collaboration.
2) You send me the output of the extract scrypt, your wallet seed version (a 0-9 number) and (the most important part) as many details as you can possibly remember about your password. Ideally, you would send me a list of words you might have used for your composed passphrase, whatever or not you used numbers, uppercases, etc. 
3) If I crack it, we will agree on a fair share. I will send you your password, and you will ~~run away~~ give me the fair share we agreed on.

Nothing of the like. Here is a solid description of the process:

This better be the fastest/most power efficient option on the planet! It was quite the challenge, took almost 9 months of part time work to build. 
It's the equivalent of 300 x 1080ti GPUs (that would run at 100M pass/sec in dictionary mode, using hashcat, that added electrum support at the beginning of last year after I bugged them in their forums for some openCL help).

Yes, it would be a lot slower. If you ever get your code running on your board and you want it ported over here it should be relatively simple!

The Litecoin fork of Electrum? I think so.

No, it's custom software. Hashcat doesn't run on FPGAs.

That seems to be memory heavy, so no. But in truth maybe because I haven't looked into it. Maybe a single pipelined core can fit the memory requirements and run fast enough. Don't know.

If you know someone with a lost electrum password that was given up on, hopefully this gives him hope!
Here is the process:
1) You must have lost your password in 2017 or earlier. Electrum versions after 2.8 use a different encryption mechanism.
2) I will send you a python script to get the first 32 bytes of your encrypted seed. The remaining 32 bytes are safely stored on your pc, and I have no way to access them. Even if I cracked the password I would still need the remaining 32 bytes to access the money. Since that 2^(32*8)  = 1e77 it's really unfeasible to do anything without your collaboration.
3) You send me the output of the extract scrypt, your wallet seed version (a 0-9 number) and (the most important part) as many details as you can possibly remember about your password. Ideally, you would send me a list of words you might have used for your composed passphrase, whatever or not you used numbers, uppercases, etc. 
4) If I crack it, we will agree on a fair share. I will send you your password, and you will ~~run away~~ give me the fair share we agreed on.
Edit: here is the extract script, linking it here so other people looking at this in the future know it didn't change.
