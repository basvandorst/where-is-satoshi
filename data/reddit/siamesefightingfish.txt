@_date: 2014-02-25 15:16:42

Anyone have an educated guess on how many bitcoins a month this place is mining? It says 60K in electricity so obviously more than that.

The sky's the limit, really.
@_date: 2013-12-06 15:03:19
Thank you, i felt like i was in the loony bin with those type of posts yesterday.
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:20:52
Maybe, or talking about those crazy days at the beginning of April when bitcoins got all the way to 226
@_date: 2013-04-11 12:36:19
Right, but how are they getting around the lag they are creating?
@_date: 2013-12-05 14:17:22
And then goes on to say that it's maximum potential is 1300$ a piece...god I wish this subreddit wasn't awash in denial and prophaghanda
@_date: 2013-04-11 03:55:27
Can you elaborate?

Well, dotcom's a huge company now
@_date: 2013-04-11 03:51:43
 But how do they make money because the lag these bogus trades create effects them as well?
@_date: 2013-12-07 06:03:05
jesus christ you need to get laid.

And I'll quote you in 24 when we're over a million dollars!
@_date: 2013-04-11 04:14:22
Are you saying that these people are setting an artificially low bid/ask directly by doing this or merely lagging to cause panic sales and having a very low bid picked up in the panic?

@_date: 2013-12-05 14:18:39
No (i.e. speculation)
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:04:15
But that's how markets function and grow. You want it both ways - bitcoin expanding and becoming widely used but not evolving through the growing pains it must in order to become that.

Interesting, do you have a source on it being added to MtGox?
@_date: 2013-12-09 03:12:12
The subway has a fee too but no one is arguing that it's the same price as taking a limo
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:32:50
MtGox is not a worthy exchange and is screwing up the overall value it's too big to function
@_date: 2013-12-04 15:35:56
Is there a way to see if his address has gotten any?
@_date: 2013-04-03 21:16:21
Wasn't it a problem selling them and actually getting the funds?
@_date: 2013-12-09 03:03:01
Leeches with ego, what a world. Maybe bitcoin changes this.

Hell, why not a thousand!
@_date: 2013-12-06 15:56:13
Oh so this subreddit is all about promotion but when things go wrong and people panic, you don't want to hear about it?
