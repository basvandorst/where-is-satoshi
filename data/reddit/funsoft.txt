bitcoin mining will be useful to fund new energy production such as more efficient solar and potentially cold fusion devices which are [starting to appear]( It could create a cottage industry of home made power solutions.. the barriers to getting grid connected to sell electricity are too high, but if you can wire up the load directly to the production it's easy.. can be a shed or barn in the middle of nowhere.. and it would have tax advantages -- no need to pay tax on the electricity and tbh, why pay any tax at all..  with existing mining farms they need commercial agreements for power.. but if you make your own power too, why even tell anyone about it. All of this increase in cheap electric capacity will eventually benefit normal electric consumers too as some operations might decide to go 'legit' and get grid connected.. or as traditional power stations benefit from the technological advancement.

no.. it wouldn't be safe as once the preimage has been revealed, someone could use it to steal any additional payments.

@_date: 2019-07-11 10:01:32
LN payments are set up as a series of payment channels.. each one locked using a hash of a preimage from the invoice.. the preimage is revealed to each of the parties in the transaction chain starting with the recipient showing it to their immediate peer by using it to unlock the funds sent to them by their peer. The preimage is then revealed by the first peer of the recipient to their peer and so on back towards the sender.
if one of the intermediaries already knows the preimage and someone attempts to route a payment using that preimage through them -- then they can immediately steal the payment without paying their next hop as they don't need their next hop to tell them the preimage.
This is kindof fundamental and won't change, so I'm not sure what bolt 1.1 does, but I guess it redefines what an 'invoice' is.. probably you end up with something where the sender contacts the recipient and gets a new hash for each payment, but doesn't call it an invoice anymore so you can reuse whatever an invoice means under the new terminology.

There may be good tax reasons (for the operator) to do it that way.. rather than charging a fee which would be income to the operating company. By hiding the fee in the price of the BTC that could allow profits to accumulate elsewhere in some other entity.. perhaps some offshore no tax jurisdiction thing that sells the inflated priced btc to the btm operating company.

what do you suppose happens when funds from those tainted addresses get deposited back into the exchanges? at least they are going to lock your account and demand a through explanation of how you came into possession of them.. and maybe if they don't like your answer they'll shut your account and/or keep the coins.

Even with 10k trades.. exchange fees are like 0.25% -- so on a 10k trade that'd be $25. Is it worth someone's time to P2P? Barely.. I think they'd want a lot more. If you think about it, the most likely way they're going to get more bitcoin to sell is to take your fiat, send it to an exchange and buy there - paying the same 0.25% fee.. so they will always need to charge more than that. Typical fees on localbitcoins the last time I used it were still closer to 5% and no advertised discounts for large amounts.
I've never had a problem receiving money from crypto exchanges.. if that were a problem I'd just open another account somewhere else. If anything I think it'd be easier to explain the funds if they came from a regulated exchange than some random guy you can't necessarily get in touch with anymore. If you look at specific cases where people have had bank accounts closed because of bitcoin, it's almost always because of P2P trading -- not because of transfers to the major exchanges.
@_date: 2019-08-13 20:29:06
I guess quite simply, it isn't painful enough yet to make people want to use P2P services. P2P is generally much more costly due to a lack of market makers and the cost of setting up one on one deals (having to chat to someone, check their id etc.. is more work than pressing buy).
@_date: 2019-08-25 15:07:40
credit unions fall under a different regulatory system than banks and can be less hostile to crypto-currencies.
@_date: 2019-08-07 18:17:57
yea this is pretty crazy.. banks business model is broken, they can't make money anymore as all the customer deposits are costing them and they aren't allowed to invest in riskier assets that might still have a positive yield..
@_date: 2019-08-13 20:34:30
Anyone selling bitcoin professionally needs to make enough money to make it worth their while.. there's only so many people they can give individual service too in a day.. I'm sure they'll sell you $100 with a large fee, or maybe $1million with a smaller % fee.. but either way they're charging a fee and it's going to be a much higher fee than you get from an automated exchange platform.
@_date: 2019-08-07 18:31:55
no. in theory maybe you owe a gain on the tx fee, since you're 'spending' part of the btc in moving it.. I kindof doubt anyone is bothering to do that though.
@_date: 2019-08-31 01:14:17
Fees are 0.25% --  -- so gbp2.50 (taker) or gbp1.50 (maker).
Get a revolut.com account and use it to exchange your GBP for EUR and transfer the EUR to coinbase by SEPA transfer.
@_date: 2019-08-25 21:05:13
exchanging bitcoins on a btm also incurs taxes (although, relatively few BTMs allow cash out anyway - they are predominantly buy only). I've used ATMs in several countries, and maybe 30% is at the top end of what I've been charged.. the lowest being 5%.. that one isn't around anymore though.
@_date: 2019-08-25 20:43:32
It's a pain.. and certainly more expensive and time consuming than using traditional bank cards and ATMs. 
The only reason to do it is if you want to include bitcoin tourism by seeking out bitcoin accepting bars and cafes and maybe use their BTC atm if they have one and it's actually in a working condition (they often aren't) or even though you dismissed it, maybe some people would enjoy meeting up with some stranger to trade bitcoin over a coffee.
Most BTMs don't ask for ID.. to be perfectly honest - there is virtually no business case for ID bitcoin atms.. the only reason people are paying 30% is because they're scared to show their ID (usually out of misplaced paranoia)

what exchanges are used in russia?
@_date: 2019-08-26 04:58:03
well thanks to the EU PSD2, online credit card payments are about to become more of a pain in the ass in the EU.. basically you'll need to get a code from a phone app and type it into a verified by visa screen for most online transactions.. so yea maybe if they make the card UX terrible enough it'll help :p
@_date: 2019-08-24 01:18:50
They can see you're using a vpn.. so maybe they ask to verify your address or provide other proof and then lock your account when you fail to do so.

non correlated means it's price doesn't move in sync with any other asset classes. asymmetric probably refers to the historical price appreciation and that you could have put in a relatively small amount of money and achieved large gains.

Those tend to be fronted with cloudflare, so basically cloudflare can see all the deposits/withdrawals.

bitstamp only accepts money by swift transfer (or sepa if in the eu).. if you were wanting to use ach better stick with coinbase. otherwise either is fine. In case this isn't immediately obvious; using swift often attracts non-trivial bank fees.
@_date: 2019-08-17 20:16:56
You should anyway, but yeah it's probably going to go down. Could be especially shocking if [Robin Tilbrook]( [case]( gets heard and we end up with a time travel brexit (backdated to March 29th 2019) slightly before Oct 31st.

@_date: 2019-08-20 02:18:05
you could make a multisig payment channel.. aside from the fact that no interface exists to do that and maybe your channel partner wouldn't recognise the tx due to it being unusual.. but in theory it should be possible. might not be a terrible idea if you wanted multiple approvals for a payment.
@_date: 2019-08-10 03:18:31
hmm.. well the chinese still get paid in yuan, so reducing the value of the yuan would reduce the btc prices of goods sold.. so i don't think that would actually solve anything.

I think there's a good chance they'll not hear it.. stall, bounce it back to the other court.. stall more etc.. but if it gets heard before brexit happens some other way, I think it has a chance of succeeding. Everyone's bored of the delays.

Yes, It will. I think $25 is fairly typical, but maybe you can get a better price elsewhere.. I don't have any recommendations though.

I'd guess there might be a way you could do a wire transfer using a paper form in branch.. but in any case it sounds like you're probably trying to do the wrong thing.. you don't want to be using the 'add external account' feature under the 'transfer funds' menu, you want 'add wire transfer recipient' under 'wire transfer' under 'send payments'.
verifying wire transfer recipients using micropayments is not a 'thing' - noone does that. you're definitely in the wrong part of the online banking site.

The only advantage I can think of is that the LLC could be 'resident' in a different legal jurisdiction than yourself.. so for example if you lived in Hawaii or NY you might use a Montana LLC to get an exchange account on an exchange that doesn't serve Hawaii or NY.

any node you connect too can tell you any block history they want to make up.. but one history (the right one) will have more proof of work.. so your node just listens to histories and adopts the one with the most proof of work. you can be tricked if someone is able to isolate your node (your ISP for instance) so that you don't hear the legit history from anyone, and only hear a fake history from fake nodes.. but if you connect to one honest node and hear the real history, your node will immediately switch to that one.

Bitcoin is a perfect scalable load.. ideal for backstopping new energy production.
@_date: 2019-09-04 18:58:23
It's safe to say that never happened, and in most other cases too. The most common source of unsolicited payments are dust attacks by blockchain analysis companies hoping that you'll spend them with other addresses that you control thereby revealing that you also owned the one they paid too. Criminals sometimes dust other people's wallets to create plausible deniability regarding their own funds.. if small parts of their stolen money are mixed with legit payments it's harder for exchanges to blacklist it all. 
In either case I'd say you're fine to spend the typically small amounts involved. You can try to avoid spending them if you don't want to help the blockchain analysts or criminals, but I certainly wouldn't go out of my way to try and return the funds.
@_date: 2019-09-08 04:46:55
There's probably loads of ways.. a simple one would just be to load a block explorer url for some public key eg:  
it has the qr code.. it has the balance.. - you could edit the html slightly to make it refresh automatically and perhaps remove unneeded information.
@_date: 2019-09-10 21:29:03
The experience has become a lot worse over the last 10 years.. I guess because the banks have massively cut back staffing levels, and also the people who work the front lines there now typically just see it as a (possibly short term) dead end job rather than a career. Possibly due to trust issues surrounding all of that they're also not given much discretion or power to do anything for customers and often have to refer them back to the online/mobile or phone banking call-center anyway.
@_date: 2019-09-03 00:50:02
In theory it's possible with an NFC wallet on your phone.. the phone can sign an LN invoice at the exact moment the card network AUTH's the provider.. so the debit card provider can only approve the AUTH after the invoice is paid (a few seconds at most).

I'm not sure you should.. but it makes a good payment of last resort option when someone's card is getting declined, or if you want to sell something to a high risk country that you would never accept credit cards from.

The bank you buy's banking partners can cut them off, and the regulators shut you down (even unofficially just by making things impossible).. ultimately if you want to do something that no existing bank is comfortable with, buying one won't help.

Other than pre-paying, they could hit your actual wallet and it could either auto-sign based on some criteria (known authorised merchant, within limits) or it could ask you to authorise payment.
