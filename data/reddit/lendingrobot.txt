Super easy Bitcoin address balance bot in Telegram messenger! Since now there is no need to go to blockchain.info! **Just drop Bitcoin address to the bot!**

We respect you. Let the power be with you!
We all want to bring all the world to Bitcoin and make it easy for people to understand it and use it. This is the only acceptable and comprehensive 3-words way to name this wonderful bot.

Haha, very funny. I'd better stick with the way how all people out there understand it. **Bitcoin Balance Bot**.  Or **Telegram bot to check Bitcoin address balance**.

Which other parties do you mean? I created this bot and it simply checks the balance from blockchain. Nothing more. It's very simple and plain. Nothing is seen by 3rd parties. You give the same info as you would by checking on blockchain.info or any other blockchain browser.

The Merkle wrote about the bot. Very unexpectedly.
I can assure you there is no logging. All requests are served by blockchain.info. Nothing else. Just an easy &amp; quick way to check balance! Especially while waiting for payment.
P. S. 6 minutes spent for creating a bot are well spent. :-)
