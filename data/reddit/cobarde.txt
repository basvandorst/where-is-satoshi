My transmission just went out too... I need to look up prices for tickets to New Hampshire.

The only thing this site did for me was make me realize that I'm still poor as hell. $4,000+ per *night*? Bitcoin or USD, I couldn't afford to stay at some of these places 20 minutes. To dream...
@_date: 2012-06-28 00:04:12
I like the idea! And you could use bitcoins as a payment scheme for those who have them. I really really like the idea! Research and kickstarter this thing or something. 
@_date: 2012-07-13 22:35:58
Alright, I did a little bit of mining when I first found bitcoin and then realized it was easier to just buy them. But I have to ask, exactly what does this do for mining? 
Last I checked (And forgive me, it's been a while) Bitcoin mined using GPU power. How would this assist in that? I'm honestly curious because I have just enough coins to actually buy this thing and was wondering if it'd be worth while.
@_date: 2011-07-14 20:17:40
Could you take a picture as an example of the quality of prints? I don't have enough bitcoins yet for much but I will be interested.

I want to know how they plan on reverting transactions when some users have undoubtedly removed their bitcoins from their system before they took it down and have them sitting in their wallet right now.
Better yet, what are they going to do about those people who have *legit* transactions between that number? It's not fair to them to have the money that they obtained taken from them because of a failure on MtGox's part. Not only is it bad general security but it's bad business.
If they actually do a full roll back I doubt that I ever use MtGox to buy coins. It was their failure, they shouldn't force their customers to pay for it.

Ahh, I just used the native bitcoin client. I'm new to this I'll admit. Is there a special way for me to setup my GPU?
@_date: 2011-06-16 00:32:36
...But I technically just started mining yesterday. Is that decent?
@_date: 2011-05-24 12:53:45
TIL that I'm not going to make any money from bitcoin because I can't get that kind of money to start up with.
@_date: 2011-06-12 17:45:28
Damnit! I was expecting it to go down to 8 today so I could actually buy my first set of bitcoins and it jumps up to 20! I'm never gonna get any money from this...
@_date: 2011-06-20 12:56:24
I understand how it would work in a regular exchange, but in the case of Mt. Gox, what's to stop me from just not using that account ever again? There are no social security numbers, no addresses, how are they going to track users? Money doesn't even go directly through them, they use other sources such as Dwolla. Go ahead, give me a negative Dwolla balance. It doesn't matter much to me. 
As far as I see it, they have no way to "make" me pay them a penny OR return bitcoins. Unless they tracked all of those coins and worked together with *all* of the other known exchanges and got them to agree not to transfer those out. But that would practically crash the entire market.
@_date: 2011-05-30 20:28:48
Thanks for that! After getting it working now I'm getting 18.0 Mhash/s
@_date: 2011-05-29 16:10:36
3120 khash/s .....so I'm going to assume I'm doing something all types of wrong.
@_date: 2013-12-01 04:01:47
Huh. Cardboard sign, QR code, television time, and some help from the dedicated who cleared up the code for everyone on and suddenly you get $26,000+ added to your account. Talk about a return on investment.
I think I may have just found my weekend project...
Edit: Maybe something like [this]( except you know, more eye-catching. (Sidenote: I should not use paint at 1 in the morning)

I'm eyeing a laptop right now and as soon as I find a place that I can use bitcoins to buy either an iPhone 5 or a Samsung Galaxy S3 then I'll be buying one of those. I'm all for helping the economy by making my big purchases with coin instead. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 17:40:46
That's it and [here]( is the quick start guide as well. 
@_date: 2013-11-16 08:37:51
Coinbase is an online wallet and is backed up by Coinbase. If coins are moved to another wallet for backup by you then they are no longer managed by Coinbase. 
Coinbase manages the security of their wallets and back up the data [offline]( themselves for security, however it is nothing that you yourself could backup. 
@_date: 2013-04-14 06:42:28
You might as well hit Ebay where they're going for $300+ for coin collectors buying them up. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:41:49
Well if we're passing out tips... 
@_date: 2013-11-16 05:43:07
A regular wallet is a single file (.dat, .wallet, etc...) that sits on your computer and contains your coins. It's a local file that if lost and not backed up will cause you to lose access to your coins. Multibit is an example of this. 
There are online wallets (coinbase, blockchain) that store your wallet online and allow access from anywhere in the world. 
Paper Wallets are used for storing coins offline and are public address and private keys printed onto a sheet of paper that you can keep your coins. If secured properly, it's the best way to store coins. 
There's a better breakdown of wallets [here]( and I'm sure someone else can give a better breakdown, but those are pretty much the basics.

And they'll do all of that while explaining the different technologies like CSI detectives with the NCIS cameo every once in a while. Double Keyboard Bitcoin Algorithm Decryption Prevention or DK-**BADP!** all the way.   
@_date: 2013-11-30 08:45:17
Yes please. 
@_date: 2013-11-16 06:46:34
Yup! Exactly what I'm saying. And in a cloud based system too like Dropbox hidden with Truecrypt or something like that for even extra security. 
@_date: 2013-04-20 23:46:13
I'm just confused.
Are you tell all of us here on that we should...invest in Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2013-11-16 05:46:35
Well that's dramatic.
