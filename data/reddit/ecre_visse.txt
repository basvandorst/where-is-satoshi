Yeah was planning to buy with the payday but when I saw the violent moves begening of June I just jumped in and bought between 6 and 10k, it's the same money anyway, better jump in before the crowd...

Never understood the concept of DCAing... DCA is good in a bear market and is bad in a bull market. It's also a less risk less reward type of investment. Why not, but it's no genius idea.

We need something simpler and more user friendly than what we have now, even LN is a pain (not for me but for any noob), 6y ago people where already saying that "it still early". In China they managed to make the whole process simple as hell with fiat so why not with BTC, it doesn't make sense to me, just do small off chain transaction for shops and maybe one big back to chain at the end of the day or something, jeez.

Agreed. Don't catch a falling knife, don't leave a mooning rocket.

The funny thing is that there is probably a few that did.

No, never saw a time traveler saying 100k 2019.

Dude... you're making 50k a year, you're among the top % of this planet.

Everything can be called Bitcoin, I could give you a stick and call it bitcoin stick, there is only one in circulation, you are now the proud owner of the single bitcoin stick in existence, congrats... but it has no value, why? Because value is based on market sentiment. 
Market sentiment is based on the perception of fundamentals. What are the "fundamentals"? Security of the network, size of the network, age of the network, speed of transaction and cost of transaction. 
On the three first factors, BTC comes ahead by miles, on the two last, the other two you mention are ahead, but one might argue that if they had the same size as the BTC network fees, at least, would be similar, on chain speed might be always faster on BCH and BSV because of the larger block size. 
You decide. Personally I only value BTC (like most of people in this market) but I don't hate on people that have other opinions. If after all you read here you still don't know what to do, you are not sure anyone is right, maybe buy one of each, BTC would cost you 10K and the other a few hundies. Worst case scenario, we are all wrong and you still own one winner, and the winner Bitcoin will worth millions. Note that I wouldn't. I would buy only BTC. But to each his opinion.

Bitcoin is not sexy, unlike "the environement". I've lost all hope to convince anyone that is not already convinced a long time ago, bull market do that way better than me. Just wait for the next ATH, wait for when a dollar won't worth a penny, you'll see the public running toward Bitcoin then. And then crash the market again like the weak hands they are. But a few will stay, that's why the bear market lows are always higher and higher...

Do you think any censored social platform (Facebook, Twitter, Youtube) will survive on the internet long term? What would prevent any non censored platform to win over censored social platform on the long term?

This is absolutely genius. Probably the best on ramp I've seen... ever. Everyone has tons of damn coins hanging at their house. I would use this lightning ATM in a heartbeat if I had one near me. 
You have a company? Plan to manufacture it in a larger scale?
