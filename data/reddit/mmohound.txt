Hard to predict. Just don't buy a lot at a time. Buy in increments

Whats the advantage of TenX? I heard about them. I couldn't find on the site where to get a card or how to 
@_date: 2017-08-17 22:51:28
Yeah just wondering cause now people saw the BCC as free money and if theres a third coin more free money lol. So I assume people would buy like mad leading up to it

Well the thing is I dont see anyone taking over BTC because all the exchanges are based of BTC why would they just switch to some fork coin??
@_date: 2017-08-09 20:37:56
Oh thank you for clarifying.
@_date: 2017-08-09 20:21:40
Oh weird. I wonder if it does that with all cards. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 23:13:41
Do both. I recommend splitting money between Bitcoin &amp; Litecoin. Once you learn a little more about Crypto's you can dive into some of the other alt coins. Just be careful a lot of BS out there.

Lulz fake. OKCOIN got a new building. 
@_date: 2017-09-25 22:00:48
All the exchanges ain't be shut down thats fake news. OKCoin biggest chinese exchange just relocated to a bigger building
@_date: 2017-09-16 04:45:47
No, most likely those exchanges won't even close. Those two never sold ICO's. China will leave 1 or 2 exchanges up easier to control.
