inflation is a hidden tax, its about different philosophy, people need good medium to keep their wealth.
spending plan:
1. keep your longterm wallet untouched - treat is as save account.
2. create new wallet for spending, always when you buy something for bitcoin recharge it from fiat.

In the past there was a possibility in protocol to send bitcoins to IP address, but people prefer to use btc address, its more safer.

I agree. I remember when it was around $130 and many people said that they miss their oportunity. 
@_date: 2013-10-17 18:36:27
Yes its personalized stamp. "234 stamps printed" should suggest it.
Maybe it is a waste of time for you, but in my opinion it's very good  promotion tool. I put them on frame in the wall, it looks good and should inspire many talks about bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-19 13:06:04
in april it falls even more, it goes up 1/2 last day so market has to check his direction. Just don't panic, don't sell, keep longterm.
@_date: 2013-10-17 15:29:53
when somebody in the future looks at this stamp will see value of BTC in 09.2013

Don't believe him. The true is more complicated than it looks. In fact in 2014 price rose to 1,000 in 2015 it was about 10.000. In next year BitXange (the biggest exchange in 2016, around 40% of market) was shutted down, because some hackers (most of people think that was a US government) break in, and put prices lower to destroy bitcoin economy. And it help temporary price fall to 230, but in 2017 it was over 10 trillion USD. But dont be to happy, its mostly because of USD hyperinflation. In comparsion to 2013 dollars it was about 23,000. It looks not much but its a lot compare to the world situation at that time. in 2017 people understand that they can't believe in value of dollar fed and later government print a lot of them, in 2017 only 0.01% of existing money was from before 2013. Interests rates rose so fast that US and Europe cannot pay their debts without printing. They start printing more and more money to cover spendings, and they finally pay debt, but with worthless paper and by destroying economies. 
Low bitcoin price was also because UN decided (with Russia, Canada and China veto) that bitcoin is illegal. Most exchanges goes to darkweb, and people was afraid. For buying or selling in bitcoins you get death penalty. In 2019 All gold and silver was confiscated from citizens by governments, they were new "global currencies" to buy anything between governments. Also at 2019 market was nationalized (small businesses was destroyed, trade non-government goods was illegal, all was produced by big national corporations). Only governments can use "real" currency as gold and silver to international exchange, for people there was only worthless fiat currencies, or risk of death with bitcoin. 
There is a lot of problem with supply shortages, power works only between 10:00-14:00 and people get cut out from internet by any reason. There is of course web of illegal hidden hotspots but only people with we can trust know of them.
World is controlled by big governments witch own the market, and the only hope for us is bitcoin, witch grow rapidly, in 2017-2023, but it is only underground economy, so you can't buy anything officially. There are of course Citadels (land of freedom created by ASIC-leaders) where you can buy food with no limits, but goverments block theirs borders, and because of their strong defense systems its almost impossible to get inside. 
And about not spending bitcoins - its untrue. Asic-leaders has to spend a lot of them to create defense systems for citadels (some of them was destroyed. Ironicly BFL labs citadel was destroyed because they have to wait too long for armory preorder from China) when there is a lack of any goods, its good to spend bitcoin for food and any valuable goods (its safer and easier to exchange valuable goods for food later than keeping bitcoin) also citadels had connection with UBFM (Underground bitcoin freedom movement) they donate them with some of bitcoins, that they can survive and spread safety over citizens to defense them from government. Hidden web acces was funded by them (60% thanks to Friedcat !)

5000 mcxFEE = 5% so 100% value of exchange is 5000*20=100k
100k*0.28BTC = 28k BTC
28k BTC * 140$ = 3,92 milion $ is it worth it?
@_date: 2013-11-03 07:24:47
I remember when it was at $120 and my friend said - well I'll wait until it fall to $66. Good luck.

Probably something with secondmarket. The day before secondmarket say about creating btc fund Max Keiser also said that something big in bitcoin will come.

1. Bitcoin mining not solve complicated mathematical equations! its just simple hash with and checking result with low probability that result is "good enough" to mine.
2. Quantity of Bitcoin in total will be 21 milions. its far far less than quantity of dollar. we can talk about VALUE, but not quantity.

@_date: 2013-11-18 15:53:35
good comparsion and explanation:
@_date: 2013-11-18 08:20:30
I think if you can afford to pay credit, and you think in longterm, its good option.

hi, i made gimp file to generate bitcoin certificates:
keys can be generated on bitaddress.org
I print private key on different paper, roll it, to prevent checking under light and stick by tape.

Peter Schiff is often upvoted.
@_date: 2013-10-10 06:06:51
it can be solved. You create address, add some bitcoins, then move "proof of ownership" , and when you want to move ownership again you have to send all of bitcoins from this address (your insert + orginal "ownership" amount)
so simply - you can recharge it :) 
@_date: 2013-05-15 19:29:17
no, it's normal with mtgox.
@_date: 2013-08-17 11:32:04
Yesterday i made some calculations, try many strategies, and always if there is a little amount of fee you loose in longterm.

I'm so happy that people stop thinking that they should buy whole bitcoin:) congratulations for you
@_date: 2013-09-17 05:36:18
I think this dystopian vision has one misunderstanding. Bitcoin is a good, like any other currency, and there is something like supply and demand. If people see that something going wrong and bitcoin is not useful for them anymore, they just boycot them, demand fall, price fall. Or even if somehow will be artificially keep up, it doesn't have influence to common people who using alternative payment methods.
@_date: 2013-11-02 16:22:30
good work!
@_date: 2013-10-10 05:57:38
If you keep your secret keys safe, your "ownership" is much more safe than your phone.

If everyone invest in something its time to evacuate to btc.

best investment - if you belive in bitcoins, just buy bitcoins.

Human psychic has a big importance.
Anyone who is new, wants to buy at least one btc, and if it is too expensive they resign.
Many take as obvious that you can't divide them (physical coin can't be divided)
@_date: 2013-05-06 18:48:35
i think there is a low possibility of this option. Even if it's true China will not destroy bitcoin, just the opposite, They will help bitcoin to grow. 
@_date: 2013-05-19 07:19:04
i think it could fit to Capitalists and anti-capitalists in the same time. because this two movements have one in common - don't like government control!
We shouldn't argue if Bitcoin is more libertarian or anarchist.  It works for both, it can be anarcho-capitalism.
and also it works for: 
revolutionary movements 
anti-discrimination movement
conspiracy theories movement
I thinkt its the most beautiful thing in bitcoin it fits to left and right side, because its a free market tool, out of government control, and in its ideology it fits to every movement which dont like SYSTEM that controls everything and can put somebody out of the system by accident or purpose. i think it fits to deeper needs many of us.

in general:
people who bought at 3$ jump out at 8$
people who bought at 10$ jump out at 30$
people who bought at 140$ jump out at 400$
It's easy to say that if you bought it in the past you would keep them for today when you know today's price.
Majority can't handle risk and jump out.

it is possible to lock phone using your ownership.
it resolve problem of phone insurance scams, they can chceck who has proof of ownership, you can't report "thing is stolen" when you don't have proof of ownership (if you try before, and then sell, they will see it).

I've been here in april and saw crash.
It happens, don't sell btc for fiat, 2014 and 2015 look great for btc. In january we have "show" in congress about debt, FED printing 85bn/mo so when inflation on dollar and real crisis starts bitcoin would be a safe heaven.
