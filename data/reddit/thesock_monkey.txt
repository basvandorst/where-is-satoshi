Mate this is brilliant. I actually really liked the part in the animation with the colored satoshi rotating then the whole ring flashing. It intuitively felt like an animation for a pending transaction and a confirmed transaction. Love the design also but agree with the people talking about continuing the ends of the S into/behind the middle.

Thanks for the heads up. Do you think the lightning network launch is a factor in that forecast?

The only fools are the ones that don't yet understand the value of blockchain technology and decentralized currencies. You can say it's a "speculative asset" because a lot of noobs will treat it that way, but its also a store of value and proven deflationary asset.

Absolutely possible. But a fork doesnt make existing btc disappear. A fork is creation of a new coin. If you want to create InflationCoin™ from a fork of bitcoin and give it a constantly growing circulation, by all means go right ahead.

I think I understand what you were getting at, but the mining pool is now way too large for consensus to be easily reached on core changes. The community will likely always be starkly divided on major changes like segwit and thus we get hard forks and new coins. I dont know if comparisons to the early days are as valid now.

What are you basing that assumption on? Do you understand what a fork is?
Your fork with a new limit would be a new coin.. Bitcoin itself would not directly be changed and would still have a 21M cap. We would have a different version if enough people wanted to use it. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 17:55:57
It seems like we're transitioning to the 'store of value' mindset whether we like it or not. The hodlers screaming at all of us would be the first indicator. I believe if we can have a unified ecosystem between all coins, another could become the leader in everyday transactional currency while bitcoin wallets become a bank account of sorts. Who knows.

I did too.. great lesson though. Be patient and buy smaller amounts at intervals (4100, 3900, 3750, etc.)

No doubt. And any changes that would increase the maximum supply of btc would be even more contentious, which is why I'm saying that we will never have more than 21M bitcoin. The community would probably never unanimously agree to inflate btc value across the board by upping the limit.

Right, the supply was set by Satoshi, and is maintained by the network. If it was feasible to move the entire network onto a new set of rules without creating a fork (new coin) we wouldnt have bitcoin cash. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:47:14
Those are answers to two different questions. We all know bitcoin has forked, but did that change the upper limit of bitcoin that can be in circulation?

Yes there is. 50 coins are mined per block with that amount halving every 210000 blocks. After some math (Sum of a geometric series), the limit we find is 21 million. 
It simply isnt possible to go back and change this. It would take a fork in the blockchain to implement a new limit. It isnt just a number some developer decided on, its a mathematical limit based on cryptology and cpu investment.

The difference being this is an entirely **new** asset. How often do new financial instruments show up in an economy?

I don't either. I just considered it a nontrivial adjustment. 3% in 3 hours shows how fickle the shorts are.

Maybe unnecessary, but not irrelevant. Faster adoption might not be a bad side effect.

Agreed. We'll see what happens as the last 5M coins are mined. I'm eager to see how the community reacts.

Couldn't you describe gold the same way though? Bitcoin is not "very literally nothing", its a store of value (like gold) that has no real use to you or I (like gold) except for transferrence of value for other goods or services (like gold). Bitcoin is just exponentially cheaper and safer to mine, transfer, and store. It's based off of some of the most innovative technology of the 21st century (cryptography and decentralized computing) and I would be hard pressed to see the value of gold ever catch up to bitcoin. 
Just because you can't hold it in your hand, does that really make it "very literally nothing"?
