I have no idea if the Chinese New Year theory is valid or not, but why would there be a seasonal 52-week low each year for the past 3 years in the same month?

Will do! Thanks!

Bitcoin Millionaire? Not sure I believe you. Tip me 25 BTC to confirm....
@_date: 2014-01-03 17:59:46
It may not seem like a big deal, but given the area...it is!

A out of New Orleans actually owns this.

Holy shit! Thank you, that's awesome!! Whoever made this (Bitcointip) is a genius.
@_date: 2013-11-29 15:47:41
Holy shit!

That's awesome! So bots assign my reddit username the tip amount, and then I have to take the initiative to create a Bitcoin wallet and link to my reddit account?

I posted this in the original thread, but figured I'd x-post here too:
A lot of web sites with non-tangible goods should look into Bitcoin very seriously. Too many publishers, creators, and bloggers struggle to monetize and adding bitcoin payment as an option is a nice digital alternative to ad space.
I'm running an experiment this month by adding a bitcoin donation link in the description of one of our web series videos. I'm hoping to report the results at the end of the month, but this very well could be a great avenue for smaller businesses to generate revenue online. Feel free to follow the progress of both using the links below:

Sorry! Didn't even know that sub existed.
Thanks for the help!

Ooops, sorry! Still learning the ends and outs of Bitcoin.
I just learned yesterday that the first exchange rate was 1309BTC/$1USD......seems insane now!

This is going to be a really dumb question, but what is a uBTC?
@_date: 2013-11-26 15:14:49
I have a feeling this is going to be one of those threads where bitcointips start flying around like crazy...
@_date: 2013-12-05 04:01:52
WHOA we can tip in mBTC now? Where have i been?
@_date: 2013-11-10 20:21:28
Yeah, it's a bit to take in. Just trying not to overly bother everyone with stupid questions.
Pretty awesome community here!

This guy gets it.
@_date: 2013-11-10 20:49:05
I'm relatively new to the bitcoin world, but based on your historical comments, and some of the large bitcointips you've been passing out, i'm going to listen to you.
More importantly, i'm going to pass this advice along to others I know, as it's very solid.
Keep it up good sir/madam!
@_date: 2013-11-10 19:37:33
Sorry, I'm doing my best, but still trying to wrap my head around everything. Known about Bitcoin for a while, just never fully investigated.
Sorry again if some of these questions are stupid
@_date: 2013-12-06 03:25:58
That makes sense....and I'm a moron. Thanks for the help, I love this community!
@_date: 2013-11-28 23:22:21
This is incredible. Love it when this community makes it rain!
@_date: 2013-11-10 19:24:17
Wait, can you Bitcointip somebody that's never used Bitcoin? If so, how do they receive?
I've never used but am very interested in the entire ecosystem.
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:30:03
I must've misread! Somebody in said you could get 1,309 Bitcoin for $1.00 in the first exchange.
@_date: 2013-12-08 01:46:06
My vote is you make it rain BTC in this thread with /u/Bitcointip
