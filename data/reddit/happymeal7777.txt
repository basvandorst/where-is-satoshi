So because zebpay doesn't have the getgems features they have a good opportunity? not sure i follow tho. What getgems is more about is the advertisement model where users who pay for ads the money goes into the pockets of users receiving the ads and not in the pockets of gatekeepers such as Facebook or google. So this feature is what is interesting to be part of the experiment, although gg indeed doesn't have a competition atm would be nice to see that.

You pay fees if you do on chain transactions, its with every wallet, you pay no fees if you do off chain transactions meaning within the app to another user. If you want to send btc ito the app or outside the app you pay fees. There is no change addresses or side chains involved. Even with bitcoin the fees for many people is unclear do you know the exact fees involved? It would help if in settings the fees amount would be listed.

It's important to note that BTC and GEMS serve different target audiences within the ecosystem. BTC is aimed towards users with crypto background, who probably already own BTC and are familiar with it. These users will enjoy a convenient method to send BTC to their contacts (ie. without typing addresses). GEMS is aimed towards the common user who doesn’t have a crypto currency background. Since GEMS are rewarded for network contribution, these users will own GEMS just from operating within the network.

Gems within the app is like Coinbase, it's off chain, a semi centralised hybrid model making transactions instant, secure with zero tx fee, although all messages are encrypted where even Gems company themselves can't have access to it.
Gems is build around attention economy. It has several very innovative ways to make it possible for users to profit from building the social network. This model is reached best with a separate token operating along with Bitcoin. Advertisers have to pay users in Gems to get their attention. Users can set the Gems limit they want to receive aswell, it also serves as anti spam, you can also chose to not receive adds. You can make Bitcoin transactions just like Gems (shown in the showcase), but you would need Gems if you want to:
- Pay for sending personal unsolicited messages
- Pay for sending private message ads
- Pay for priority messages
- Pay for a sponsored appearance in the contact list / user directory
- Pay for a commercial company page / e-commerce
For more details of what each of these options offer check this [link](
Appart from that Gems as a brand is attempting to attract younger users and especially female into the Bitcoin ecosystem. These target audience are ruling the social messaging world, the layout shows it aswell. The app is aiming to disrupt the established social media business model through the power of crypto 2.0 technology. Companies like Facebook and Whatsapp receive all the profits they make from you themselves, with them you are the product. Gems wants to change that and give the power to the users. Hope it cleared some things up.

Instant messages in Gems arrive in two flavors - standard and secret. Standard messages are the default type and provide a standard level of security. Secret messages are meant for highly confidential conversations and provide an extreme level of security and privacy. App users can switch between these two flavors for every chat conversation. Making a conversation secret is very easy, and only requires tapping on the "lock" icon inside the app.
Instant messages are encrypted on two levels. 
The first level of encryption is relevant for both standard and secret messages. For both types, all communications between the Gems mobile app and the Gems instant messaging cloud server are encrypted - this is also referred to as client-server encryption. Communications between the two is performed over SSL in a secure tunnel (HTTPS) with 256-bit keys. This prevents third-parties from listening in. This also prevents man-in-the-middle attacks and makes sure the Gems app only communicates with the real server and not anyone impersonating it.
The second level of encryption is only relevant for secret messages. On top of the client-server encryption, secret messages also have client-client encryption. Every Gems app generates a unique random pair of 4096-bit public/private keys upon installation. The public key is propagated within the network, but the private key never leaves the device. The public/private pair is unique to a device. If the user transfers his Gems account to a new device, a new pair is created. The key pair is also expired and refreshed periodically to enhance security.
When user A sends a secret message to user B, it's encrypted using RSA 4096 with user B's public key. Once the message arrives to user B's device, it's decrypted with B's private key. Decryption can only take place on user B's device because only this device has access to the correct private key.
The benefit of client-client encryption is that it provides a zero trust environment. The encrypted message cannot even be decrypted by the Gems server infrastructure. This means that even if the Gems servers have been compromised and hacked into, secret messages are still 100% private and can only be decrypted by their rightful recipient.
The drawback of secret messages is that they cannot appear in push notifications. Since push notifications are encrypted by Apple's/Google's infrastructure, they don't conform to zero trust policy. When a secret message is sent from user A to user B, the push notification user B receives contains the text "You've received a secret message from A" instead of showing the actual content of the message.

Your only excuse is that they got paid half after the first Milestone. This is a usuall thing to do. You ignore completely that they have been very transparent with every stage of the project, doing due diligence, doing podcast interviews, attending Bitcoin conference, actually being investigated by Koinify to see if they fulfil to the requirements of anti scam and being a serious company with serious goals, being public with their identities, having an unmoderated bitcointalk thread, the AMA on Reddit, google hangout and more. They want to build a community around Gems and the only way to do that is to be as open and transparent with their users regarding Gems product and Gems short and long term vision.
Gems is the first project taking this higher route of accountability, people like you should think twice before making such claims.
@_date: 2014-11-19 14:53:13
What i found. Gems advertising model is built around "attention economy". Reading incoming messages is time consuming, and our time is a very valuable resource. The straightforward solution is therefore basic economics. If consuming messages is expensive, sending them should be expensive as well. By placing a gem price tag on sending unsolicited messages, we can guarantee that you get paid (with gems) for the right to contact you.
See [Potential advertising models for Gems](
Regarding funds [see here](

That's actually their main goal, to get the average person into the Bitcoin/Gems ecosystem. Gems is aimed towards the common user who doesn’t have a crypto currency background. Since Gems are rewarded for network contribution, these users will own Gems just from operating within the network.
Regarding privacy, communications are much more encrypted than the common social messaging app, like Whatsapp for example.
Instant messages in Gems arrive in two flavors - standard and secret. Standard messages are the default type and provide a standard level of security.

I don't think you understand it. Telegram is added value and opens the door for a broader audience. Apart from that it has solved some drawbacks raised by the community where the Gems team reacted to it in a great way. 
- Android wallet came at a later date - Now Android &amp; iOS will be released together.
- Android users couldn't receive airdrops, only iOS users could - Now the airdrop is available for both Android and iOS users at the same time. 
- If the airdrop would have been extended to a later date for Android to be ready, another competitor could enter the field and do it earlier - With this update it will not be possible.
- Gems innovative features would come at a later date - This way the team can release them sooner than they mentioned.
- Gems didn't have the advantages of Telegram integration - Gems now has apart from all it's features also the advantages of Telegram integration.
Putting Gems in an even more superior position than it was. 


This isn't changing their concept, it's using already proven and developed code for the messaging infrastructure, everything else needs to be made from scratch (built in wallet (which will be first mobile Counterparty wallet) reward &amp; airdrop systems, anti-spam filters, the advertising platform, etc). There is a lot more to the project than just the core messaging protocol. The platform does not change, I don't know where that is coming from.

Anyway the algorithm which counts how many Gems each account gets is not implemented yet, only rewards for referrals are implemented and in beta. I immediately received Gems for 1 referral yesterday, but it's still in beta. The rest of rewards will soon be added i think. [**Here**]( is a detailed explanation how rewards work.

You posted the same thing in the other Thread and now you post the same sentence here, but i will explain it from my point of view anyway. GetGems actually proves there can be great projects blossoming aside Bitcoin.
The Gems in the app fit GetGems as a brand if you look at its name, color, features, you would expect an in build currency system representing its name. It's needed for different reward value programs which is financially hard for a new start up if they would reward everyone in BTC. The power of Bitcoin enables devs to customize their project how they want, i guess also because the whole point is that user participation is translated into value so you need a coin that is exclusively earned through the app and not a coin that originated somewhere else.

Is Coinbase Exchange Open-source? No, however we plan to open-source some of the libraries we use in the future.
Even if some of their stuff is, it's not completely open source, so why would people trust it? Cus it works, is useful and 90% of users doesn't really care. I understand that it would be better but maybe there are reasons why its not the right moment to open source everything. Other devs might copy the whole thing and give it a different name, with more funds and marketing power, so i can imagine the app wants to gain some traction before open sourcing everything.

As a gg user i don't think it's going viral now, but it ha sthe potential if done right, but its emotions people say all kinds of stuff, there is a recent [interview]( on letstalk bitcoin.
GetGems is the name of the app, Gems and Gemz are the same with Gems being the currency in the app (along with Bitcoin) and Gemz is the name of the asset on the exchange. So if you transfer Gemz from the exchange in the app you will see it as Gems and vice versa.

@_date: 2015-07-24 10:44:25
Indeed, it's one of Coinbase related apps now

Telegram is the next best messenger, its open source and privacy oriented, GetGems is a client of Telegram it does the same thing, but with with the added benefit of simple usage of bitcoin and give you rewards too. Both have the ability to use voice but i don't think its possible to use voice to julia the bot.

I'm no technician, you need to ask someone else, but i have read that transactions happen between your device, telegram encryption, ssl encryption, and coinbase encryption. I have used it, it works and i like it and seems like I'm not the only one. you act like you know the weaknesses, so please crack it, i bet you can't.

Or actual supporters upvoting and commenting, if you have issues with Telegram security contact them, i am not technical enough to know details, i rate the app as an average daily user and like it so far, have a nice day.

Because it connects Coinbase to 65 million Telegram users, if even 2.5% attach their username to Coinbase through this, it would be more than the whole current bitcoin userbase which is build in 6 years. Also it's simple to use and something people are familiar with, don't know what you mean by voice activation, have you tried it?
@_date: 2015-07-22 14:02:43
Nobody has cracked it yet, in fact there is a 300k price for you on table if you crack it, since you know i would say easy money, good luck.

Secure messaging is not my priority, go spam your Open Whisper Systems elsewhere. Worst way of advertising.

search for getgemsbot you will find her.

You get Gems for each invite, for the amount of Gems you have in the app, for using the app like messaging, making transactions etc. The Gems advertisers pay goes to the users instead of the company, the ad models are not out yet but thats basically what this app is about, build around attention economy and reward model.

Can't find you, you should give the username you signed up with, go to wallet, setting, under GetGems wallet username. Mine is Cyb3rpunk

Follow or get rekt

Looks pretty secure to me  It's not just a clone, it has many features Telegram doesn't have. It has its own features with the added benefits of Telegram, thats an upgrade because you can connect to 50 million Telegram users with it and introduce them to the Bitcoin network.
@_date: 2015-09-12 10:02:10
Just type /help to the bot and it will explain, you can use this in getgems too.
@_date: 2015-03-02 20:27:59
Both have not commands, on Gliph you need to create a wallet first and if you want to send bitcoin you tap on the options button and the 'attach coin' and choose how much you wanna send, on GetGems it has already its own wallet and if you want to send bitcoin you just type for example 0.1 btc and send it.

Thats awesome andreas rock it bro.
@_date: 2015-10-10 11:52:00
That didn't really make sense.
@_date: 2015-10-24 20:37:28
The app has bitcoin as a currency and runs on the bitcoin blockchain and might be interesting for those using bitcoin, by your analogy then they have to crack down on all the NASDAQ using Bitcoin Blockchain threads etc. After all the stocks would be altcoins. What u are asking for is pure cencorship.
@_date: 2015-03-02 20:07:42
There is [Gliph]( and [GetGems]( Both support bitcoin but from my experience getgems is user friendlier.
@_date: 2015-10-06 17:43:58
$10 is decent if you trading with 25x or 50x leverage.

First steps to Andromeda.

But nothing to do with the currency bitcoin, he probably has his own centralised project in mind. He is trying to benefit himself from bitcoin technology.
@_date: 2015-02-03 12:46:53
So more bitcoin selling for dollars by merchants? Good for adoption, bad for price.

Change satoshi to bits and dont add multiple cryptos, makes it look cheap.
@_date: 2015-02-15 15:55:06
Also i doubt the person who finds 7000+ btc would like to exchange it for 720 btc.
@_date: 2015-02-06 16:53:04
Awesome game
