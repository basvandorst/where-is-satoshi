Good luck getting friends, family, and angel investors to give you $3.5M in funding. I worked at a startup that began with an angel investor: that allowed 1 full time employee, a CEO who worked for equity, and an office that was literally the CEO's living room. Everybody else was a contract worker (which was a bit sketch). You can't run a company with dozens of employees that get benefits and an office that costs $50 per month per square foot this way (yes, that really is the state of things in SF right now)

Without external funding startups like Changetip would not be able to begin. Without venture capital Changetip would have never existed. Moreover venture capitalists allow non-profitable companies to continue to operate much longer than they otherwise would. Changetip was, at its peak, raking in tens of dollars of revenue a day while paying roughly 1000x that in employee salaries and an expensive San Francisco office space. Who would make a loan to such a company? An unprofitable company like Changetip would have folded much quicker without venture capitalists backing it.

That's not what the book claims. It claims Trump and Ailes had a conversation in which Ailes suggested Trump appoint Boehner to a position. Trump responded, "who?"
That doesn't mean Trump has never tweeted about (or golfed with) Boehner. It simply means that someone Wolff interviewed said that Trump, in that specific moment, didn't recall who Boehner was -- a fact that is consistent with other accounts of aids being worried about Trump developing alzheimers. 


Again, that doesn't mean they are false. The conversations in the book are recreated from interviews, since Wolff was obviously not there for many of the conversations described.

Amazon's only had one year where it jumped nearly 1000%, and that was 1998 when it jumped 966%. In 2000 it dropped 80% when the tech bubble popped, and then dropped 30% from *that* level in 2001. It nearly recovered from that, but then the Great Recession hit. It wasn't until 2009 that it finally returned to that same price from 1998 (adjusting for splits).

No one owns Bitcoin, they merely have it in their possession. Suppose my BTC is taken by a hacker. Since the transaction was anonymous, society cannot force the hacker to give it back (property rights cannot be enforced). Nor will the Bitcoin community even refuse to accept the stolen coins (under some argument about fungibility, typically). If no one either enforces or even respects property rights, then what is ownership? It is merely possession. The same sort of concept of ownership a warlord might have.

The article is comparing figures from today with 2007, *before the recession* and *before QE even started*. QE didn't start until 2009 and didn't really didn't pick up until 2010.
Since the start of QE the unemployment rate has dropped from 10% to 5.9%.
Now you could say, "oh, oh, but they don't count people who have simply given up searching in the unemployment figures." That is true, but there is simply *no way* you can say that we've lost 10 million full time workers like the article claims.
You can see that *since QE started we have gained about 7 million full time workers*. Not lost. Gained.

But what he's saying is absolutely correct.
Gold derives most of its value from cultural tradition. It has some intrinsic value (for example in the manufacture of electronics) but that plays only a small part in its valuation.
Modern culture (at least Western culture) is not so impressed by shiny trinkets. We don't have kings gilding their halls with gold to project their power; in fact we find such displays pretty damn gaudy. We flaunt our status in other ways: iPhones, fancy cars, photos of our lavish vacations on social networks, how many Twitter followers we have, etc. So why do we value this metal that has very little use to us at all?
In a modern context gold is not worth very much. It also costs money to store and so you should expect gold to have a negative real return on investment.

Here's a scenario that I imagine. A covert organization creates a mining pool that offers a *special introductory deal*. "Join the pool and you get 200% payout your first week!" A lot of people would join the pool to take advantage of this. The deal would cost the organization a few million dollars, but it would ensure they could gain majority control of the network temporarily. Meanwhile the organization also secretly controls a number of other pools to conceal the fact they are gaining &gt;50% control of the hashing power.
At this point the organization can execute a 51% attack and completely destroy confidence in Bitcoin as a currency. All at the cost of only a few million dollars. Quite a good return on investment.

First off, why are you looking at LocalBitcoins as a metric for adoption? It controls only a small portion of overall BTC trading.
Bitstamp and BTC-e show consistently decreasing trading volume and each controls many times more overall trading volume than LocalBitcoins does. In this chart you can see that Bitstamp controls roughly 20x the volume that LocalBitcoins does and shows that trading volume is decreasing:
Secondly, why do you think that trading activity implies adoption at all? How do we differentiate between people adopting bitcoin and people trading it for speculative purposes?

I literally don't get what you are arguing. Can you break it down for me? If you walked me through step by step I might be able to see my error of logic.
But to answer you directly without knowing exactly what you're getting at: yes, it's ok to buy things you don't need, and by don't need, I mean your livelihood isn't threatened by not having it. Things have utility that is totally unique to the individual buying. I would buy a PC (if I didn't have a good one already) even though it depreciates in value because it has utility to me now, in the present moment, that exceeds its cost. If it didn't have utility to me *now* I wouldn't buy it until later because the fact it depreciates means I could derive more utility by buying in the future.

Not necessarily true. Some may be waiting until they've held it for one year before selling so that they can claim it as a long-term loss. For most Bitcoiners that means waiting until December. Some may merely be waiting until the last selling opportunity in the hopes that it won't be a loss at all. And even long-term ers will get the tax benefits by selling and repurchasing. I'm long on stocks, for example, but I still tax loss harvest. Why would I turn down free money?

2. you sell. Now you have $1875 in USD and an extra $750 coming from the IRS as early as February 2015.

I do agree that it's foolish to put savings in dollars. I only keep as many dollars in my savings as I need in the case of an emergency -- the only advantage dollars have is their liquidity. Most the rest is in bonds and stocks. Some in Doge ;) to me this is not a disadvantage of the dollar though ... It ensures that dollars are always spurring economic activity rather than sitting around.

If you pay ATM fees then you have a crappy bank.
Ally will reimburse you any ATM fees that *other banks* charge you at the end of the month. A lot of credit unions will do the same.
Lets also remember that ATM fees are just the free hand of the market in action. The most common case is a store owner wants an ATM because they don't accept credit cards, but they don't want to pay for and operate the ATM themselves ... so they get a third party who is willing to install an ATM for free but is compensated with the fees from that ATM.

Again, not true. If it were true the IRS wouldn't bother to differentiate them.
Long term capital losses must offset long term capital gains before offsetting short term capital gains and vice-versa. For the *vast majority of people* this doesn't matter, but ...
If I have both net long term capital gains and short term capital gains that are in excess of my losses then I will want to offset whichever is being taxed at the higher rate. It is *unusual* for the long-term capital gains to be taxed at the higher rate, but *not impossible*. For example if the long-term gains are from selling collectibles they will be taxed at 28% while if the short term gains are from selling stocks they will be taxed at ordinary income tax rates. In such a situation generating long-term capital losses could be more tax efficient.
Anyway, I don't want to get further into this, because *in practice* you're correct. For most people it doesn't matter. But *technically* speaking you are not correct.

Yup, if the price goes up the borrower is very likely to default on the loan because they'll have to pay back much more than they borrowed. If the price goes down you'll get paid back but at a reduced real value. In both cases the lender loses.
Personal loans is also a tough industry no matter the currency. Before LendingClub and Prosper there were a few attempts which ultimately lost lenders money and went under.
Furthermore one tool that p2p loan companies use to ensure borrowers pay on time is automated bank account withdrawals of monthly payments. Without this tool late payments are much more likely. Since Bitcoin is not a pull system, this puts it at a disadvantage.

Since gold is a non-productive asset, its return on investment comes down entirely to current supply and demand. You cannot have a long-term increasing demand for gold in the same way that you could, for example, earn constant interest on a portfolio of bonds. Over a long enough timeframe, you would therefore expect your return on investment in gold to be effectively zero. And since gold incurs a cost to store, you should expect the real return to be negative. 
Now of course some people have made money on gold. But should they expect this outcome? Not any more than a gambler going to a casino should expect to come out ahead.
Don't invest in non-productive assets, because it's a zero-sum game. For every trade there's a winner and a loser. This includes Bitcoin. It's not an investment.

Not true, it's whether you think it will perform well compared to investments of equal risk. It's easy to find risk-free investments that will slightly outpace inflation: in fact I-bonds are garaunteed to do this while also being graunteed not to lose value in nominal dollars either. But since Bitcoin is high risk like stocks, maybe you should invest in it unless you think you can expect a comparable return: something like 10% a year.

I agree with that, but my point is that the results of the bet don't necessarily align with which investment is better than the other. So I think the bet is flawed.
In my example two investments are pitted in a similar bet as OP originally proposed. Even though both investments have the same average return, the riskier investment usually gets more out of the bet. This is a consequence not of the fact it is a superior investment (actually accounting for risk it is a worse investment) but rather a consequence of the sheer mathematics of how the bet works when one investment is high-risk-high-reward and the other is low-risk-low-reward.
I can take this to the extreme: I will take my $180,000 to Las Vegas and bet it *all* on red on the roulette wheel. You can put it in Bitcoin. I'll then bet you that at the end of the year my strategy will have produced more profit than yours. Winner of the bet keeps all the money. Do you see the flaw in this bet? It's that if I lose at roulette I'll have no money to give you, and if I win at roulette it's almost impossible for you to win the bet (Bitcoin would have to more than double in value). The bet is therefore slanted against you. Does this mean that roulette is better than Bitcoin? Of course not! How did I accomplish this? It's because my investment was higher-risk-higher-reward than yours.

I am not an expert by any means, so bear with me on my questions:


Is the main reason for this because Bitcoin payments are verified and not reversible? Or is there another advantage to Bitcoin that prevents you from being scammed?
Also: it all sounds all very good for the seller, but what about the buyer? Obviously you are not a scam company, but how is the buyer assured that they are not being scammed? What if someone more or less copied your website but instead of shipping out orders they just stole the Bitcoin? With a credit card the buyer could dispute the charge, but with Bitcoins once they send it it's gone for good.

I'll bite:
1. It's an enormous waste of electricity
2. Regular people are not sophisticated enough to use local wallets, so they use online wallets, which cause them to have their money stolen.
3. It takes too much storage space and bandwidth, again, encouraging online wallets
4. Having all transactions recorded in every node actually means that Bitcoin is not scalable. For n users to each have m transactions it requires n^2 m storage.
5. Bitcoin could seriously be taken down by a major government if they really wanted to, they just need to control majority of hashing power for a short period of time. CIA could easily start a number of mining pools and accomplish this. For all we know they already have!
6. Threat of malware stealing all your money
7. Transactions take too long to confirm for Bitcoin to be practical in most instances
8. Speculation has made value too volatile to be used as store of value.
9. Irreversibility is great for sellers but terrible for buyers, limiting consumer adoption.
10. Since shared ledger is based in collective agreement, future disputes could lead to Bitcoin fracturing into multiple currencies.

Except the inflation in Russia is not caused by inflation of the money supply. In fact, the central bank is doing everything it can to *reduce* money supply (for example, by hiking interest rates to 17%).
The inflation we're seeing in Russia is due to low demand for the ruble. Why? Because with gas prices so low, Russian gas companies don't have many dollars to exchange for rubles.
This is exactly the type of inflation BTC has seen this year: it's not because of an inflating monetary supply, it's a matter of supply and demand. Bitcoin does not solve this problem.

The fact is that most demand for gold is coming from emerging markets like China and India.

Suppose you and I have dice, but our rules are slightly different.
I put in $500. If I roll a 1,2,3 or 4, I gain $100. If I roll a 5 or 6 I lose $100.
You put in $500. If you roll a 1,2,3 or 4, you gain $200. If you roll a 5 or 6 you lose $300.
If you do the math, you'll find that the expected return of both these die is the same. In both cases the expected outcome is to gain $33.33 and wind up with $533.33. The difference is that your die is a lot riskier. When you win, you win big (end up with $700 vs my $600). And when you lose, you lose big (end up with $200 vs my $400).
Now suppose you make me a bet. "Let's put in $500 each, roll our die, and whoever ends up with the most money afterwards gets to keep *all* the money combined" Is this a fair bet? What is the expected outcome of the bet?
Case 1. I lose the bet. This happens whenever you roll a 1,2,3, or 4. There is a 2/3 chance of this happening. In the event that it happens I, of course, lose everything to you.
Case 2. I win the bet. This is because you rolled a 5, or 6. There is a 1/3 chance of this happening. In the event that it happens, you give me your money. How much do you have? Only $200 ... you already lost most of it! How much do I have total? Well, it depends what I rolled. There is a 2/3 chance I will end up with $800 and a 1/3 chance I will end up with $600, for an average of $733.33.
So what is the expected value of the bet? On average I will end up with $244.44 versus my average of $533.33 that I would have from not entering the bet.
In other words, this is a shitty bet. The odds are not fair. Even though the expected return of our dice were the same, not only did your dice's higher risk increase the odds that you'd win the bet, but it also made it so that even when I *do* win the bet, my prize has already lost most of its value. You should never make this kind of bet when the other side has a riskier asset. Never ever ever. Mathematically it doesn't make sense. 
In case you couldn't guess, Bitcoin is the riskier dice. Regardless of your opinion of Bitcoin or Berkshire Hathaway, this is a shitty bet.

The downvote numbers are not actually real due to fuzzing. Only the post's overall score is real.
**How is a submission's score determined?**
A submission's score is simply the number of upvotes minus the number of downvotes. If five users like the submission and three users don't it will have a score of 2. **Please note that the vote numbers are not "real" numbers**, they have been "fuzzed" to prevent spam bots etc. So taking the above example, if five users upvoted the submission, and three users downvote it, the upvote/downvote numbers may say 23 upvotes and 21 downvotes, or 12 upvotes, and 10 downvotes.

The largest S&amp;P 500 fund is managed by Vanguard and charges 0.05% annually. The largest gold fund is GLD and charges 0.4% annually. Even the cheapest gold fund charges 0.25%.
But the reason why you should expect a positive return with stocks does *not* come down to expenses. It is because they are productive assets. Companies make profits and return a portion of those profits back to investors in the form of dividends and stock buy-backs. Gold just sits there being gold.

This is only an issue if you're treating the dollar as a long-term investment.  After all, we're talking about a timespan of 101 years here.
Nobody has their retirement money or investment money in savings accounts. If they have them in government backed securities at all they'll be in treasury bills, whose returns have greatly exceeded inflation. $10,000 invested in a 10-year treasury fund 10 years ago would be worth $17,000 today.

21 incs IP will never be adopted by any major tech company, and I doubt it will ever make it into any consumer hardware at all (that is to say, any hardware not specifically marketed to Bitcoiners).

No it wouldn't. The result of a drop in BTC price will weed out those miners who are least energy efficient because their energy cost will be above the value of the BTC returned. So the result of a massive price drop will be to eliminate all but the miners who have a combination of cheap electricity and energy efficient hardware. 
You have things backwards: a difficulty drop doesn't allow energy-inefficient (GPU) miners back in, but rather difficulty drops are going to be *caused* by the energy-inefficient miners leaving.
BTC reducing in value will make the network *more* centralized, not less. That's another reason why price drops are going to be so problematic from a security perspective.

That's just the thing: it's not at a loss because it's only being run for a short period of time. During that period they attack the network and perform double-spends, block transactions from going through, generally cause havoc and what-have-you. To make money they could short Bitcoin on an exchange while they perform the attack. Bitcoin drops 50% in price and they make an instant 50% profit, for example. Or through the use of leverage or options they could make tens or hundreds of times profit. Just imagine how much money you could be making if you had the ability to predict exactly when BTC's price would move.

Unfortunately Bitcoin's cost per transaction in the form of miner subsidies is already ~$10 USD. That's more than people pay for trades under the current system. And even if the ledger is decentralized, an exchange will still be necessary just like the current system, which will add to to the fees. Now maybe you could get the exchange decentralized, but Bitcoin hasn't accomplished that for the currency, so what chance does it have for stocks?
Finally, this isn't really addressing a problem that actually exists. T+3 settlement is only a problem if you're day trading, and there are special accounts for that where the funds don't actually have to clear before putting in new orders. For the majority of people, who buy and hold stocks for long periods of time, the current system serves them well.

In 2001 Enron's stock collapsed from a record-high to zero. By October of that year it had already lost about 80% of its value. But when compared with 1983, it was still up 1000%. That didn't stop it from going to zero by the end of the year. That comparison had no bearing on the present value of Enron at all.

Last year Q2 results were 21% below Q1 results. This year Q2 results are 22% below Q1 results. Last year Q3 results were 37% below Q1 results. So we can project that this year Q3 results will be, let's say, 39% below Q1 results, which puts them at $45.5 billion.
Then having chosen even the worst possible fiscal quarter you would still conclude that revenue has grown 85% since Steve Job's death.

Notice that with each new technology the rate of adoption is faster? The telephone took 50 years to reach 80% adoption. The PC took 20 years. The smartphone took only 5 years.
But Bitcoin was invented in 2009. So why hasn't it reached 80% adoption yet?Because for most people it's simply not a compelling technology. That's not to say it isn't important, but remember, Bittorrent didn't kill the RIAA and MPAA but rather it spurred the creation of Spotify and Netflix. Nor will Bitcoin ever kill traditional financial institutions that the majority of the world will use. It will cause them to evolve.
@_date: 2018-03-31 21:17:17
not really. If banks just provided a standardized low cost method for rapid transfer of value it would more-or-less destroy all the use cases for Bitcoin that don't involve speculative investing, evading capital controls, drugs, etc. No normal person would ever have a reason to use it at that point.
It's kind of like: prior to Netflix I used Bittorrent for a lot of traditional media because media companies business models were frankly antagonistic to people like me. It looked like they would *never* offer their shows online and commercial-free and would cling to grossly overpriced cable subscriptions until they died.

The Social Security taxes you now pay go into the Social Security Trust Funds and are used to pay benefits to current beneficiaries. The Social Security Board of Trustees now estimates that based on current law, in 2041, the Trust Funds will be depleted. Because people are living longer and the birth rate is low, the ratio of workers to beneficiaries is falling. Therefore, the taxes that are paid by workers will not be enough to pay the full benefit amounts scheduled.
However, this does not mean that Social Security benefit payments would disappear. Even if modifications to the program are not made, there would still be enough funds in 2041 from taxes paid by workers to pay about $780 for every $1,000 in benefits scheduled.

That is true and if you are a vampire or any other type of creature that lives for hundreds or thousands of years, I highly recommend holding gold. It's a natural fit because you've got a vault in your castle or some other secure and secret place to store it. And if shit really hits the fan you can always bury it and come back hundreds of years later to get it.
For everybody else I recommend a mix of bonds and stocks.

Legally speaking you have to pay taxes on it.

Of course the maximum block size should be increased. After the Bitstamp fiasco many blocks hit their maximum size and people waited hours for transactions. 
Two things can very easily cause Bitcoin to run up against the limits, and they both happen when the network is already in crisis: people panicking and causing a temporary increase in transaction volume or the hashrate dropping which causes blocks to take longer to generate. If people's transactions can't get through they will just panic more and things will spiral out of control.
The fact this problem hasn't been fixed shows a clear lack of any sort of leadership in the community. Is Bitcoin just going to wait until it's nearly destroyed by this flaw before fixing it? It should concern everybody.

Of course it is, and it will continue to get lower as the US gets older.
We should be looking instead at the unemployment rate, the number of *discouraged* workers, and the number of involuntary part-time workers ... people who would want to work but cannot find good jobs. The labor participation rate is not an indicator of the health of the economy.

Gold has held its real value fairly well, but in terms of long-term investments, historically it's pretty much the worst (besides cash).
If you updated this chart for 2015, gold would be up 4%, bonds would be up 6%, stocks would be up 8%, and cash would be down 2%.

I agree, but my point is that just because a technology is exciting does not mean it will be financially successful.

I have, because I own a lot of their stock.

Overall financial transactions will get cheaper using the work we do and Bitcoin related approaches.

Of course they are. Bill gates was damned excited about Apple technology, so he made Windows and practically destroyed Apple. Bill Gates was damned excited about OpenGL technology, so he made DirectX and practically destroyed OpenGL. The list goes on ...

Right. Inflation is bad, of course ... unless you want a currency that is actually used as such.

Bill Gates talked about Bitcoin because badgered him on his AMA. He didn't have anything good to say about it.

I didn't say it was an argument against investing in BTC, just that it explains how he feels about it. 
What you're saying is true. People who bought and held BTC have all fared well since BTC has recovered from each crash ... somewhat like how people who bought and held index funds have also fared well in the long term. But at this point I don't know that that makes a historical precedent or not. One year of history of gains is very different to me than 80 years.

You do realize your claim is tantamount to arguing that the largest 500 companies in the US in 2013 are not more valuable than the largest 500 companies in the US in 1928, right? Apple Computers clearly produces more real profit today (from hundreds of millions of iPads and iPhones) than Chrysler produced in the 1930s (from mere thousands of cars). It should be obvious that the real value of the S&amp;P 500 has gone up.

Well, duh, because you've made money. But how would you feel if you put in all your liquid assets at its last peak and lost 33% of it already?


Investing in index funds is probably the least risky investment you can possibly make if you follow a buy and hold strategy. Much less risky than Bitcoin, although also with less potential returns. Historically speaking even with the most unfortunate timing possible you would not have lost much following this strategy over the last 80 years. Meanwhile we don't have much historical data on Bitcoin, so it's much harder to assess its risk.

Remember: the financial system merely creates products that investors want. Investors *want* to invest in Bitcoin related companies, which is why this fund is being set up. And Fortress wants to get investor's money through expense fees. That's the *only* reason ETFs exist. Once this ETF is set up it will need Bitcoin related company IPOs to fill it. Startups will then form to fill this demand, and they may or may not have sound business models. The key thing is that Fortress doesn't stand to lose money, nor do the leaders of these startups. You, on the other hand, do stand to lose money by investing.
Anyway, I urge caution.
