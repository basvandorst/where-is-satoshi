Bitcoin needs a truly safe and anonymous silk road type service more than any early adopter would like to admit.

He only expects the price to rise because he bought into the wishful thinking of the early adopters/miners.
If we started modern society with a bitcoin system, and no fiat. It would be like giving a few nerds and a hacker community all the early printed fiat, then tell the rest of the population they needed to trade farms and livestock to said hackers to get a piece. 
You really see this as a mutually beneficial trade?
The cryptocurrency of the future needs to start out on even ground somehow.
Until then, it's early adopters trying to take advantage until the clock reaches 0.

Why would random sheepX drop 10k for 1BTC in a few years?
All he's done is ensure some greedy, hoarding, early adopters/miners get rich. Which seems to be what bitcoin is actually about.
I personally bought around 100, sold around 1000, but why bitcoin? unless your an early adopter hoping to get rich?

Consider how much influence those with all the early coins have. Do they possibly have enough influence to intentionally cause such a crash in theory?..  The re-distrubution phase, or whatever you wanna call right now, could very well lead to another solid wave, I agree. Maybe the panic is real though, and the big players aren't manipulating it behind the scenes.. 
Either way, my prediction is BTC stabilizes around 500-1000 longterm.. Maybe if enough people dream hard enough someone willll trade 1 million fiat for a btc because charts n projections n hopes n stuff.

The collective mind being anyone currently holding btc?
Bitcoin is an experiment.. and it's not looking good.

Bitcoin already roped in the first wave of investors during that 700-1100 swing. They all were bent over and forced to take it. You've likely lost all of them, and now the second wave of investors will be incredibly skeptical at this point.

The 10k is nothing more than high hopes and dreams. Don't forget that the first wave of investors already took it from behind during the rise to 1100. They're all likely gone, now your waiting for an incredibly skeptical second wave. 
The experiment doesn't have the same potential it once did. No doubt crypto can be revolutionary going forward.. but as of now the Government, hackers, and early adopters own the vast majority of coins. Why would wave 2 of investors want to invest now?

It's all speculative bs for the most part.. You pretty much have to read everything and decide for yourself what could be real.
If your looking for the top secret site where the Mtgox and Bitstamp guys plan their inside jobs your probably out of luck.
I felt like an idiot for having coins in a localbitcoins wallet for less than an hr when btc was around 100.. The fact people still have no clue how to protect their bitcoins should be extremely worrisome to everyone involved. Human greed may kill bitcoin.

possibly, I was just trying to make a general point. The ones buying in at 700+ were the investors BTC needed to jumpstart the kinda growth we hoped for. People like me that bought around the 100 mark and sold at the peak don't really care right now, but had I bought in around 700 I'd be absolutely terrified to ever trust bitcoin again. This will have an effect.

Real change from btc is an illusion.. it's more about shifting the balance of power, or perception of it slightly. Problem is early adopters, the government, and various hackers would be the only true beneficiaries of btc taking off now.
There's not much in it for anyone else except hope n dreams. The early distribution method was a great idea, but there's no way it's good enough to propel btc into what we'd like it to become.

Real change in our generation? lol.

Sell half, then hold onto my lottery tickets.
