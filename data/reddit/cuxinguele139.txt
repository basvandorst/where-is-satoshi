how would you buy bitcoin without identifying yourself to anyone? other than cash purchases. from what I know all the exchanges require at least ID

I love how you quote as if youre addressing his point, but you're really just spinning it to not really address the issue with believing (and misinterpreting) fucking FOX news when you have literally the best information possible available to your fingertips via briefings.

My comment is a comment. That's what it's for. Who are you to say what I should and shouldn't do with my comment? 
seems like you're taking a page from your hero. 
@_date: 2017-02-07 23:44:59
It shouldnt. because they legally cannot delay it any more. My bet was a joke, the person I responded to is mistaken. 
@_date: 2017-02-07 22:58:31
You obviously aren't really dumb and I apologize for coming off like that if I did. Having a frustrating day. But we want to be able to read government emails. GPG would allow them to keep their conversations completely private (unless they gave their key away, making the encryption a bit pointless). 
We want transparency when it comes to public servants. I think these email leaks exposed at least a couple reasons why.

You **do not** want to go shot for shot on presidents saying factually wrong shit while defending our current POTUS. He's only been in office for a fraction of the time of others and you would still lose. 
Not to mention the fact that any semi-intelligent person can tell that Trump speaks like a man with limited vocabulary and understanding when it comes to the topics he's now responsible for.

I've been here. Knowing what a quantum computer is. what about you? There isnt a device out there that offers true quantum information processing. 
@_date: 2017-02-21 15:48:53
I don't. I do most of my exchanging on gemini then straight into cold storage. I was mostly curious. 
@_date: 2017-02-22 22:25:49
I guarantee you many people would get richer if given multi-million dollar inheritances and the networks that come with going into the same exact business your father was uber successful in. What has happened when  he's tried to venture outside of that one business? (other than reality TV, which clearly necessitates genius to succeed in). failure. that's what. 
This point is tired and false. Stop assuming people with money arent morons. You're wrong. Life isnt fair and pay isnt merit based. wake up
@_date: 2017-02-22 22:36:48
that isnt relevant and I don't need to semi-dox myself to get a question answered. If you're too embarassed to answer the simple question I asked you then that is your problem. Keep livin in that spin zone though. 
@_date: 2017-02-27 05:30:04
No I'm talking about an actual universal quantum computer that isnt built to solve only a very niche equation that doesnt have any real applicable uses. 
@_date: 2017-02-08 00:53:43
and what if, at times, the bad actors are the ones writing the emails? 
Still completely against politicians using encryption to make their communications unreadable if they needed to be due to a court request or something. that is insane. 
@_date: 2017-02-22 22:31:38
so answer me this. It'll say a ton about you. Do you think Trump speaks like an intelligent person? with a mastery over the only language he knows?
Because I don't use filler words or the word "very" every other sentance and english is my second language. 
Because I can honestly say I've met 5th graders that are more articulate than he is.

I'll take that bet. 5 BTC?
@_date: 2017-03-08 16:51:17
great! now if you guys would stop promoting vigilantism and murdering people who you think might be using/dealing plants then people might consider your country somewhat sane.
@_date: 2017-03-21 18:40:40
I think if it's determined that you have DLed files with hashes of child porn images and stored them on your encrypted drive that you should be jailed for refusing to open them. Do you really think this guy needs defending? 
@_date: 2017-02-27 00:08:26
I'd like to argue this. Bury me in data please. Real quantum computers do not exist. D-Wave isn't quantum computing. Go.

Yea, let one woman change your view on half our species. That's a wonderful idea if you never want to be happy. 
@_date: 2017-03-12 19:43:27
 Haha well first of all if you haven't heard of Seabrook you weren't paying attention. Secondly, *you* (someone who apparently lives under a rock) don't need to know the corrupt banksters name for it to be an important event. These guys aren't always famous. they usually aren't. 
@_date: 2017-03-21 19:13:38
How would this make anyone less safe? The way I see it, the courts are having a tough time establishing whether having evidence of those hashes is enough to force him to open the drive (or hold onto him if he doesnt). That seems like enough to me. This is iffy territory due to hashes as evidence being a relatively new (and probably dense for the layperson) thing. But in terms of the logic of it all I agree with holding onto him if they found those hash values to match. 
 Can you explain to me why allowing him to be held would make any of us less safe? Or maybe you think that will establish some sort of precedent that could be dangerous. In which case, what is that precedent?
@_date: 2017-03-14 00:25:21
not even a little bit. how did you manage to project so hard that you got that out of what I said? 
@_date: 2017-02-05 23:44:16
not on keepkey. you verify it on the device's screen
@_date: 2017-03-14 05:36:05
None of what you said is a fact and it figures you don't know what facts are due to the field you work in. 
Not being able to distinguish genuine fact from made up statistics hampers any further discussion. Thanks for proving what a petty person you are with another gross comment though. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 02:59:28
that is assuming the redpill community isnt full of insecure, emotionally lonely mysogynists. 
But it is.

The bias of this sub is kind of showing. Preet was an asset to any government and fearlessly went after corruption and has a flawless track record. Him being fired is a huge loss. Don't be stupid just because you're blinded by bitcoin. 
"Jim Cramer once hosted a hedge fund conference with an audience comprised of Wall Street's rich and powerful and invited Preet to speak."I know that you told me that there were going to be a lot of people here from the hedge fund industry and other folks," Bharara said to Cramer. "I didn't quite appreciate how many people, so I just want to apologize in advance that I don't have enough subpoenas for all of you."The room erupted. He waited for the laughter to die down and said, "Obviously I'm kidding. I do have enough." "
The guy was a fucking boss that didnt discriminate when it came to chasing and ending corruption.

It isnt very good to be honest.

I'll bet you 500 ETH that it wont. wanna take that bet?

@_date: 2017-03-21 20:29:45
Agreed. It's unfortunate how many of my peers hold the "I have nothing to hide so I don't care" mentality. It's rough convincing people why that isnt a valid thought process. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 03:01:02
you revealed more in your pathetic, toxic tirade there than I ever could have found through coaxing it out of you. thanks.
Newsflash. maybe youve been treated that way multiple times because your insecurity and mysogyny attracts the same type of shitty women? just a thought. 
@_date: 2017-03-21 19:42:44
Are mirroring hash values not conclusive evidence for you? I can see how it might not be for a judge who doesnt understand CS very well but surely you can see how that can be considered some sort of evidence
I actually support this kind of thing. If they have saved hash values for known files of things like child porn then they can easily determine whether you are potentially culpable or not and move onto holding you and doing so until you open the drive. 
And yea I'm interested in seeing how this has been handled in the past. Never seen hash values even mentioned in a court case. 
@_date: 2017-03-12 19:44:23
You have zero idea what you're talking about. 
also, newsflash: people who hire other people to assassinate people deserve to be in jail. Whether or not they deserve to be there for life is a different matter. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:23:53
 lemme know how that re-entry point works out. 
@_date: 2017-03-21 18:59:21
I don't. No network is impenetrable. What is your point exactly? That someone would "plant" hashes? If that is your point then why wouldn't they just go ahead and plant physical evidence? Not sure your logic follows. 
Also my personal network enforces non-repudiation like every system should. so planting something would be much easier physically than on a network. 
@_date: 2017-03-21 19:54:26
While I agree somewhat, I would definitely argue that an incriminating hashvalue is more damning a piece of evidence than a witness or a polygraph (both of which still somehow hold some sway). There is a much higher probability of a witness misremembering or being intimidated or being coaxed into saying something than there is of a hash value being compromised. But these are opinions which the larger court system apparently still doesnt agree eith despite evidence showing both of those things as highly unreliable.

They display it on their website and have signed press releases with it until october of last year. Not sure what to tell you that you can't google yourself

Hey I'll take you up on that. In the area anyway. Can post proof afterward?

He wasn't claiming it. He was very clearly asking. Try reading his comment?

what makes you think it won't be widely adopted? ETH is still in the infrastructure building phase. Once more client-facing dapps are released the adoption will likely come. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 17:11:39
might be a thing? there are hundreds of dapps being developed and tested right now. Something tells me you haven't done the research necessary to continue this discussion.

your responses in this post make it clear you made all of this up. sign a message or gtfo with your attention whoring lies. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 00:32:32
I guarantee I've been part of the Bitcoin community longer than you have and asking you to sign a message is an age old way to easily prove yourself. If you arent willing to do that then the communty has zero reason to believe you're anything more than another FUDster who sold his 2 BTC stash and is hoping to find others to make them feel better about it. 
You can prove me wrong *whenever* you want. The burden of proof is on you. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 18:27:03
and where did you get that idea?
@_date: 2017-06-13 23:41:11
Unfortunately there is only one situation in one industry where intermediaries/middlemen are used....what a shame.
have you even put 5 minutes into researching what a smart contract *is*? because it sure as hell doesnt sound like it. this sub is low effort as hell lately. what the hell happened to you guys. 
@_date: 2017-06-13 22:20:12
I can almost wade through the irony of your post combined with your username. 
Have you ever developed a project using blockchain before?
@_date: 2017-06-13 22:17:07
no one has found any real uses for smart contracts....can't tell if serious or just awe-inspiringly stupid. 
Ever heard of a middleman? Intermediaries?
Jesus at least put some effort in. And you're the top comment? Fuck this sub has gotten dumb over the past couple years.

I'm all for shitting on bad tech but try to get things right otherwise you just make yourself (and your community) look bad.
