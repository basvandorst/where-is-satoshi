Like, do I have to create a wallet on bitcoin to trade, or do I just set up a wallet on one of those sites and it all intermingles?

Thank you! Very unhappy? Just because of loss basically?

Thanks! I dont get it, is bitcoin the same wherever I purchase from? Some people say BTC-E, You say Circle... I just want ease of use and security.... while making sure I can make money possibly. Or at least learn while doing it.

Thanks everyone for your great suggestions. I just want to make sure I understand everything correctly... 
Say I buy $100 worth of BTC today, at the price of 234.591, and price jumps or drops tomorrow, I either take the hit... or if it's increased to say a hypothetical number of 400.000 I pull out and make the difference ? 
I'm sorry for my stupid questions, I am literally very cautious and dumb when it comes to investment/ reading comprehension.
Thank you

This is how stupid I am when it comes to btc...I thought op was proposing the $10 bill would be worth money and he was offering the person who finds it a way to deposit some of the profit into op's bitcoin acct. Wtf. I'm dumb. 
Op nice idea! Thanks for sharing
