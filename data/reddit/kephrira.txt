Transactions don't require a centralized middleman; sometimes there's a payment processor but not always, and in any case its difficult to see how that is harmful in any way to the user and certainly doesn't affect the decentralization or otherwise of the network itself.
Even exchanging for another currency doesn't need centralization if you use something like Bitsquare.

To be fair, since they don't know how much money they are going to raise (this goes for Lisk and Mycelium) they would have to create 5-10 different business plans, each of which would have to be quite fuzzy to cover a range of values. Imho trying to create a proper, detailed business plan in this situation is futile. In any case they've said what they are building so just assume that 100% of the money raised is going purely on developing those features and nothing else.

The 51% threat is not so black and white as that.

And his efforts have been deeply counterproductive. 
In some ways this blocksize debate has restored my confidence in the average person. Zealous supporters on both sides have done dodgy stuff, and it has always been counterproductive.
r/btc  and the big blockers got some significant momentum early on, because people saw censorship here and on bitcointalk and pushed back against it. Then they pushed extra hard with all the trolling and astroturffing, while at the same time it seemed to me like the censorship was relaxed here, so ordinary users started ignoring them and now it looks like Segwit will go through with majority support of users and businesses (who are ultimately guessing what their customers want in many cases)
The lesson here for both sides is: be reasonable, be open to discussion, and you'll do well. Resort to dodgy tactics and it doesn't matter who is right or wrong, people will turn against you because actually, despite appearances most of the time, most of us are reasonable, rational people.

The argument (from the second 8btc.com link) that LN will devalue Bitcoin because it will become a metaprotocol connecting blockchains - so you will primarily use LN rather than Bitcoin, and that LN will include many other coins, really threw me. It made sense to me and I hadn't thought of it before.
Effectively this seems to remove scarcity, because if LN becomes the protocol people are using for the majority of transactions, and it includes an arbitrary number of coins from every blockchain which joins the network, then there is no scarcity and little inherent value to any of the coins.
What are the specific arguments against this being true?
@_date: 2017-03-16 19:04:47
I don't know, probably. But that doesn't change the fact that it will never happen imo.
@_date: 2017-03-09 20:13:20
Its not an on-chain transaction, its a potential on-chain transaction, which is not quite the same, although I see your point.
But to play devil's advocate let's say the majority of shops, services etc accept LN payments, and LN supports multiple blockchains. They are not actually accepting Bitcoin specifically. So if non-lightning transactions become uncommon as people are using LN instead then Bitcoin loses the value from being money - because you can use any coin not just one of 21 million for the majority of things Bitcoin is used for. 
If enough people leave all their coin in LN channels (and considering how many people leave their coins on exchanges I'd say there's a fair chance a lot would) then Bitcoin becomes like the gold in banks which is never redeemed, only rather than issuing more notes than they have gold they just issue notes for silver, copper and tins of mackerell, which all work just as well - they can effectively allow the creation of notes for anything. 
I would worry that you then end up in a situation where only notes which are 'backed' by something have value because Bitcoin, for example, can no longer claim to have value for its use as a payment system with a network of users.

I can, but I may get it all wrong because its a bit beyond my area of expertise.
Basically the article is about academic research which shows that with just 0.0000002% of Bitcoin's hash rate under your control you can make a profit by attacking mining pools. 
I think to do this you need to bribe some of its miners to submit stale proof of work, but you can make it worth their while and also make a profit yourself.

Its about block propagation times giving big pools an advantage, because when they mine a block they can start looking for the next one on top of it before everyone else knows about it. 
Bigger blocks take longer to propagate across the network, so increase the advantage of big pools.

Whilst that is true, who is the deliberator?
I guess here is the core of my concern and I'm actually not sure if it is valid: It seems to me that LN raises the possibility of decentralized exchanges between all LN supported coins, which can be manipulated via smart contracts and therefore automated. So someone requesting money in one currency may receive it from somebody sending in another currency.
In addition, many merchants and service providers are (at least at the moment) likely to denominate their prices in fiat rather than BTC, and receive the equivalent value in any coin. So that doesn't look like separate networks with overlapping participants to me. It looks like one network with multiple points of entry - none of which is preferable to a fiat linked coin.

Government will encourage the takeover of self-drivng cars, and will then have full control over who is allowed to drive and where they can go.
Most people can afford smart phones, but most people can't use them beyond basic functions. As gimmicky features continue to proliferate, many people will simply give up trying.
3D printing will allow anybody to create an inferior copy of a $20 product for the low, low price of $50 (ever heard of economies of scale?). Wonderful.
Bitcoin will continue to grow, eventually consuming so much electricity that electric costs go through the roof and most of the world can't afford it any more.
Artificial intelligence will reach a point where it is capable of taking over the world. Of course it won't do it by itself, because its just a machine, but it will be owned by small groups of wealthy and powerful people who most certainly will use it to take over the world. 
Combined with robotics, AI will render the vast majority of people in the world economically dispensable. Realizing this, the small group of people who own the AI and the robots will dispense with them. Most of you will die.

Thanks for commenting Luke-jr, but that's perhaps just as glib as the headlines is.
Sure, you don't control Bitcoin in the sense of having enforceable authority. But the day to day reality is that unless people noticed something they don't like, and create a new fork and get a majority of miners on side - all of which is a pretty substantial undertaking and may not even happen if something is well hidden without the code - yes you do control the bitcoin code, which itself controls bitcoin.

Permissionless to send and receive coins and so on. That doesn't mean anybody can change the code to anything they like without anybody else's permission.
What's less centralized about nodes or businesses having all the power compared to miners having all the power? The whole point is that if any of the individual subsets of users take all the power and excludes others then it gets more centralized. 
But in actual fact it is set up to maintain the balance and prevent this. So by trying to total exclude the miners you are creating the potential for big problems and at the same time weakening the balance of power which protects Bitcoin from hostile takeover.
If the choice is between miners or nodes I side with the nodes. But if a compromise is possible then that is surely better.

Currently most businesses who accept Bitcoin already price their products in fiat and then sell immediately for fiat because their costs are in fiat so then need to have predictable revenue. Increased adoption of Bitcoin can only decrease this practice not increase it, as it will increase the probability that some businesses will have costs denominated in BTC. The value doesn't have an affect on this unless the majority of merchants think its overpriced, at which point it will probably fall back to a fair price so that doesn't matter anymore.
It will certainly never become a closed userbase, I meant in terms of numbers of people rather than specific people. there is always room for churn within that, but it is inevitable that one day it will reach its maximum penetration, unless population increases mean that a stable percentage equates to ever increases users. which is possible but I think would still lead to it being less volatile than it is now.
Also ppl didn't stop spending gold in shops because of value, they stopped because its cumbersome to carry in your pocket, time consuming to verify as genuine, and not easily divisible into very small amounts (a penny's worth of gold is microscopic) so they swapped it for bank notes which originally represented a certain amount of gold, and then they got scammed into still using the bank notes even when they lost their gold backing (a practice known as fractional reserve which was originally not known to the public and led to massive bank runs when ppl found out, until the government stepped in to compel ppl to accept the scam).

Perhaps you've only got a small amount of coins in that particular wallet and are willing to take the tiny risk of having them stolen so you can have an easy to remember password and always be able to access them - if so, who am I to stop you?
Perhaps I should add advice about creating a strong password instead, so people know what they should be doing.

I guess you've got a point there as mining is more centralized than node operation. 
I still favour compromise with miners rather than trying to shut them out of the process though.

Lightning transactions will be cheap, but they don't use Bitcoin nodes - they are layer 2. So the point remains, what's the point in being able to run a node if all your transactions are lightning payments which don't even use your node?

Absolutey, we need to see the details because if there is any chance this is some kind of ASICBoost defense plan then its got to be stopped. 
But you then go on to not wait for the technicals and instead assume to know what's happening based on your opinion of certain people. I suggest you listen to your own advice.

My point was you can't prove a negative. 
Its up to the person making an assertion to prove it, not for others to prove it wrong.
If you want a more technically correct answer I think this is it: it depends what's in the hard fork. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 18:48:03
Where did you see that its not broken by a hard fork? If that's the case then it may well change my opinion on this compromise.

The tech world has such as funny idea of 'start-up'. Uber and Airbnb have been around for years and are massive multinationals. But just because they've never made a dime in profits they get to keep calling themselves start-ups indefinitely.

As far as I can see this is just trying to taint any compromise talk by associating it with unfounded accusations about something else entirely. Very bad form.
@_date: 2015-03-08 20:42:20
Well for a start you don't need to trust it, as your private keys are generated in your browser and never leave your browser - there is no way I can access your coins.
If you create an account on thebrowserbank.com you can access it from coinb.in, and vice versa, or by downloading the sofware and running it yourself. That's because you aren't logging in to access data stored on a server, you are simply re-creating your private key from the email and password using cryptography - like a brain wallet. This means you don't even have to worry about the website disappearing and leaving you unable to access your coins.
If you think you can trust big names then think about the people that had their coins in Mt. Gox. There are some well known web wallets out there which may be suspectible to a similar fate, because they store your private key on their servers, where it could be hacked and stolen.

Have you seen the trade volume? There's plenty liquid and I think you're overstating their power. This is another speculative pump, it'll crash hard eventually just like all the others.
Having said that, its still rocketing so I guess Bitcoin can say goodbye to the top spot for a while at least.
@_date: 2017-05-22 18:33:29
Perhaps. But the main two positions are Segwit vs Block limit increase; I really meant not being willing to consider any argument from the other side of that debate even when its an attempt at a compromise.
@_date: 2017-05-22 12:14:14
You could trigger a UASF for whatever purpose you want if you could afford to set up enough nodes, but if it was totally the result of a single entity doing this (called a sybil attack) then when it created a fork businesses and users would presumably choose the original chain.
What that means is it could help you subvert the system, but you'd also need some support from elsewhere.

If they use the standard Bitcoin software and don't make any additions or changes it won't track user IP addresses, but any node operator who wants to certainly could do that. 
One solution to this is to have your own Bitcoin node on a rapsberry pi and if you have dynamic IP use something like no-ip.com to get a static IP (or set up a node using a hosting service), then you can connect electrum and other such wallets on your laptop and phone to your own node.

I see it as a threat, but not because it will overtake btc. I just worry that anybody who uses Ethereum first will be put off cryptocurrency as a whole for life by how complicated and horrible to use it is.

I see, then what's the difference between soft fork and hard fork? Surely that would be the case still with the UASF?

I may even be wrong, google can't find it. To be honest I didn't read fully it at the time, I just thought I saw something but maybe I got something wrong in what I'm remembering. Sorry.

If you are worried about that kind of thing the best wallet is the Bitcoin core wallet.
If you don't have a desktop computer to run it on then electrum is quite good too and easier for you.

I wait with baited breath to see you 'prove' the Saudi weapons deal link.

Its an interesting question. Many people compare Bitcoin to gold, because they are both 'real money' rather than 'fiat'. Literally nobody spends gold in shops any more but it is still 'money' in the sense that its a store of value and that gives it a high price. Bitcoin will always be spent more than gold, because ppl sell gold then spend the fiat whereas you can just cut out a step and spend Bitcoin.
Also, eventually everyone who is going to use Bitcoin will be using it and the volatility will level out to moderate deflation due to lost and abandoned coins, giving more incentive to spend. I think we've got a long way before that happens though.

Hyperledger is shaping up to be the great adversary, the false prophet trying to take Bitcoin's place while promoting the exact opposite of what btc stands for with all its identity tracking and government partnership - even central banks maintain a separation of powers with government, but these guys just want to jump right into bed with them.

Probably not.
Of course it depends what wallet you are using. if you're using an account service like Coinbase then obviously they know everything and so does anybody who can get information out of them. 
Otherwise, at the point you stop the only way anybody could know is if they could get the information from the two people who sent you those 1 btc payments.
But the potential problem comes when you spend 1.5BTC, taking inputs from both of those incoming payments and combining them in a single outgoing payment. At that point anybody who can track the source of that outgoing payment knows you got those two specific incoming payments. But that isn't easy to track. To cut the rest a bit short for simplicity: If you run a full node then they it would be possible to track but very difficult and very unlikely. If you have a lite wallet (electrum etc) then its just difficult and unlikely.

He's an ex-microsoft programmer who has a 'web bot' which scrapes the internet and claims to be able to predict future events based on changing linguistic patterns or some such nonsense.
He's predicted some very whacky stuff and is always talking about a breakaway civilization and alien technology in the Antarctic and deep state related stuff. But recently he's been talking a lot about cryptocurrency. 
Since others have had some success predicting crypto prices based on forum comments and the like maybe he's onto something, but probably not.
