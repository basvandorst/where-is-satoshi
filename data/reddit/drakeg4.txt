Minmus at least.

Or way underpriced if you're a badass.

Oh cool, that's impressive. Well done guys.

On top of this, MUs can't be bought with Credit Cards while WU and Moneygrams can (not that that's a great idea).

Do you know what website you're on?

Have you asked around? My local board/card game shop accepts them but they haven't really took the initiative to advertise it.

Well I certainly hope it's for blind people because I know the fully functional people certainly don't get the fuck out of the middle of the road in my neighborhood.

joke explanation: The last few days in have become a haven for tons of TA showing that we were nearing a make or break point (end of a long term triangle) so the mantra for the past couple weeks has been "the next few days are critical." As days passed and nothing happened it became a joke. Then we jumped $50 in 24 hours and now it kinda turns out the past few days *were* critical.

You forgot the most important one.

From my limited understanding, it's a giant computing network that does "harness computational power". The problem is that it is a giant single purpose computing network. It can't really do anything besides compute SHA256 hashes.
Think about much older computing networks like SETI or Folding They are basically doing the same thing, giving tasks to a giant network of computers. Single purpose tasks, like folding proteins. Those networks can't really compute anything more than what it was made to compute.

Yes, and I said in my original post that BTC is bad for microtrans for other reasons but because "decimals points are hard" isn't one of them

Hot Topic is really strange. You have all the punk/metal stuff in the back. What's up front? Pokemon, My Little Pony, Adventure Time, Minecraft....
Thinkgeek would need to have a section for sports equipment to compete with that.

I have never found a site with a more intuitive and useful product filter than Newegg. It's not even a contest. Overstock sure, but Newegg?

I always put my money on sites that look like a geocities page!

Nah, you use a lot more the half your fuel just getting out of the atmosphere.

This isn't really any different than cents and dollars. 100 cents to a dollar. 1000 mBTC to a BTC. The only difference here is that BTC is more valuable than a dollar so the mBTC is the de facto "dollar" here while counting things in BTC would only matter when counting large amounts of money.
It simply a matter of getting used to which metric you use for which purpose, much like you wouldn't measure a road in inches and you wouldn't measure the length of a car in miles, nor would you list its price in cents. Once it becomes more adopted by the general populace, mBTC will be used as an easier metric than a full BTC.

Yeah, they aren't even trying to hide it. Most schemes are sneaky but this one just basically says "yeah, it's a pyramid scheme."

is where you need to go.
Currently we are in a short drop as the market retraces (as happens after a major rise). It has only been on the rise for the last few days, we finally just got out of a 5 month long bear market.
I'll link a few popular chart guys from bitcoinmarkets.

JezzBall was my jam. I even found a glitch in it where if you could get a ball in a tiny enough space and clicked on it, it would create the wall and pinch the ball into place so it just stayed there spinning.

.008 BTC

8.00 mBTC
There. Moved it.
^(Note: there are other reasons that make BTC less desirable for microtrans but this isn't one of them)

How durable is the image on the steel against abrasives? Obviously I could sand it off with some elbow grease but what if it gets dropped onto concrete and stepped on/moved around a bit before I find it again?
I see that it is etched so I'm assuming it's pretty damn durable but hey, might as well go ahead and throw that to a test as well.

Not as bad as the 42% they had in January.
