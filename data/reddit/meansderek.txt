Good to know I may end up selling them. I’m playing now to see how it all works

Oh god no. More of focus on Bitcoin. The others were cheap to play around with and see

That’s a good point, I’m still learning and reading and watching but no one has really touched on that
@_date: 2019-07-29 14:21:09
Got rid of everything but BTC

Ouch, sorry

Yeah, oh well about the order number, as long as people  don’t use it to steal the device. I can trust reddit right? 
Also yeah I’m relatively new to cryptocurrency and for the most part the stuff I have I have to hodl for years  and will move more towards the paper wallet option. This is going to be a small amount so I can review it and put on my site. Ive heard good things on the Ledger or Trezor and would like to try those along with the Ellipal titan. The $5 is a hell of a deal for me to try out and see. I don’t feel comfortable with using the exchange wallet at all given another one just got hacked recently.

That’s fine as long as you cant see my dick
@_date: 2019-11-30 12:58:16
I was tempted to order like 4, good thing I didnt

Just picked one up for $5 from their Black Friday sale, never used one before but definitely looking to get off the exchanges and onto something more secure. Thoughts?

So let me start with I am fairly new to the work of blockchain and cryptocurrency but its all I think about, ask my wife. So as I started getting into it I noticed that it was semi difficult for me to find stuff that I know realize are fundamental, several months into this and I am now just reading Tapscott’s book Blockchain Revolution. The sole purpose of the site is to be a first step to joining the world of bitcoin/cryptocurrency aimed at people who have no knowledge but didn’t know where to start. This is not a finished product and I am still adding to it. So if there is stuff you find I am missing then please let me know so I can add and feel free to tell others to visit the site.
