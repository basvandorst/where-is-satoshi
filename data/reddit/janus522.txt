You should probably retire in preparation of your new wealth

Andreas is THE best speaker on crypto- PERIOD. I reached climax twice during this 60 minute talk.

A hard fork usually involves a portion of the miners, and full nodes removing themselves from the bitcoin network- a smaller network is weaker. Also it doesn't look good to potential new buyers if the community is breaking apart, going in different directions

This sub is one big circle jerk. You're absolutely right. We should be working to make it easier for noobs to get info, and there should be more technical discussion on problems/ possible solutions, etc

If you can’t answer a question asked by someone who shouldn’t be trading crypto you shouldn’t be giving advice on trading crypto.

Oof, I’m cringing hard reading you complain to someone who’s Giving you an ELI5, and you still don’t get it, LOL!

Why are you such a whore? We are in the middle of a circle jerk, and ur killing my hardon

I would say, there's an equal amount of risk in not converting some of your fiat into bitcoin.. your call
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:02:23
I used canadianbitcoins.com - they're legit, but their prices are really high. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:54:54
What if it is eventually accepted by enough people/businesses that you don't have to convert any of it to dollars? How would it get taxed then?

Ive used Bisq to buy bitcoin 3 times now, in $CAD. 100% success rate for myself.
@_date: 2018-02-22 01:23:54
Coinbase is the quickest but, you can only buy 1000 bucks a week quickly, need verification which can take up to 2 weeks to buy more

If it wasn't for people like you, Bitcoin wouldn't be what it is today. You can kick yourself, but there aren't a lot of people that can say they were using btc in 2014 never mind 2012

As long as u move it out of coinbase aren't u fine?
@_date: 2017-10-29 02:40:02
whats fudding?
@_date: 2017-10-29 02:43:40
@_date: 2017-10-29 02:42:12
when u say bitcoin, u mean bitcoin core? are the miners switching to bitcoin cash?
@_date: 2017-10-29 02:53:44
gotcha, arent the miners what make that particular network secure? what im asking is if, a bunch of miners move away from bitcoin core, would it become less secure. and the network they move to would be come more secure, assuming it is also decentralized?
@_date: 2017-10-29 03:38:30
thanks man, appreciate it! :D

If bitcoin couldn’t survive people that disliked bitcoin, it wouldn’t exist anymore
