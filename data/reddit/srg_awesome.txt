I just realised I haven't answered one half of your question
When you create a paper wallet, you get a public key and a private key.  The public key is used to make deposits and check on your balance (you can use blockchain.info).  You can give that address to anyone if you want them to send you coins
Your private key however is to remain private and used only to move your coins

I heard it from that weird "internet magic money" banner on reddit a few months before it hits 1000$ the first time... Thanks whoever put it there!

I just hate when people just say "buy the dip!". 
Who can know for sure when will it dip? What the dip will look like? Is the dip over or will it crash further? There's just no way to answer those questions but apparently we still get people who talk like they do

Basically when you use a paper wallet you can consider it as along term storage, so send in your coins but don't retrieve them
When you want to retrieve them, I use a software wallet (electrum) which gives you the possibility to transfer all your wallet at once (sweep). You can then keep whatever spending money you want in your software wallet and send the rest back in a new paper wallet

Send me some coins and I'll do it for you then

Why not make a simple spreadsheet? 
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:40:49
I know what a dip is. I mean that there's no way to predict if the next dip will actually be higher or lower than the price right now.
Are we at the bottom of the dip right now? Will the price continue to crash?
And let's say the price start to trend up again, I should wait for the dip to buy again right? What if the next "dip" is at 16k?
There's no way to predict if now is the best time to buy and anyone claiming otherwise is either a fool or a liar

Ahah, what the fuck is up with sidewalk anyway?!  It seems to be the go to arguments when discussing taxes and governement (see the "taxe is theft" thread earlier today)
@_date: 2014-08-13 15:28:51
Can someone explain what does "we" means here in that sentence? 
Should we collectively vote on something? Or each individual have personal believe that they individually enforce?
I'm all for Snowden's crusade and that quote sure sounds nice, but how does it translates in reality?  Ultimately, people can simply make the argument that government are supposed to represent the people no? 
@_date: 2014-08-13 17:27:17
Thanks for the support!
I'm not advocating AT ALL that governement should be trusted in any way, all I'm saying is that governement is ultimately our voice in our society, like it or not. So saying the WE should be in control of something, and not the governement, seems kinda "off"...

As much as I love cracked, this article is all kind of wrong 
I mean, really, we are screwed because bitcoin is not anonymous? Or because I have to pay taxes (as opposed to paying taxes on any other kind of investment)? 
A better title would have been: "4 reasons why bitcoin is not magic money"... 
@_date: 2014-01-07 14:36:22
Because that's always a great idea... 
@_date: 2014-08-13 19:00:39
That's not my point
What I'm saying is, who the fuck is "WE" in Snowden's mind and how can "we" all decide who's to be trusted? It's cool to say "power to the people", but in reality what do we propose?
I'm not here to argue about all those silly "Governement are corrupted man" or any other "only X% people voted on the last election", go the if you wanna do that...
@_date: 2014-01-31 18:28:33
While I agree with you in a general way, cracked is still a comedy website, we can't hold their research to any journalistic standard (although the article wasn't even funny, so go figure!)

Sure I'm not chastising playing the market,  but I think it should not be your main strategy.  I have about 90% invested automatically weekly and keep 10% just to scratch that "gambler's" hitch
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:06:26
He should be, depending when the coin was made
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:23:12
Shit I never knew that (that's why I was only moving my coins every month or so)
Thanks a lot!
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:34:06
Correct, thanks

I cannot upvote this enough for the "weekly buys and dollar cost averaging is the way to buy"
Most people here are obsessed with "buying the dip", but how does it matter if you belive Bitcoins are going to 100K$+ if you bought at 9K or 8.5k?  Spread your risk accross weekly buys.  
IMO, anything else is trying to "play the market", which is a bad strategy for the everyday user (or even seasoned ones)
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:40:47
Could not have put it better myself
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:02:30
Simply set up an automatic buy (I use coinbase) for a set amount every week.
Since I don't like keeping my coins on an exchange, once every month I clean the account and send it on my paper wallet
By reading your question I guess you want to do frequent trades (which is what I avoid) but if you want to go that way I guess keeping a portion of your btc in an exchange and trading from there is the way to go, but I wouldn't know much about daytrading

A paper wallet is an offline wallet for which you use the public key to deposit and the private key to withdraw.  Treat it like a piggy bank tough, you can deposit all you want, but when you withdraw, withdraw everything a once (sweep).
You can also use a software (electrum) or an hardware wallet (trezor).  You can ask 100 users here and have 100 answer as to how it's best to store your bitcoins, just as long as YOU control your private keys! Or else, well just google "mt.gox"

The average cost of your bitcoin is "$ you spent / BTC you have".  If you have spent 10 000$ on btc this year and  have bought 5, you average cost is 2 000$/btc.
Cost averaging means buying fixed amount more frequently.  By buying more frequently, you lower the chance of buying at the wrong time and spread your risk more evenly accross the year.  So basically it's the concept behind why you should set up automatic purchases
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:04:07
That is an extremely simplistic example.  You're going to beat the market every week? 
The thing is, it's pretty much impossible to call when you are in the "lows" and when your are in the "highs".  Sure you will try to sell for higher than what you paid, but will it be optimal? Will you blow all your load on a 2% gain and miss out if the dip continues?  And it ain't exclusive to bitcoins either, it's the same on the stock market.  Millions of traders (highly experienced one) can't beat a simple index fund for that exact reason.  See: 
For anyone saying that you can beat the market, here's a quick fun game
 
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:20:51
Yes to the first point, no to the second
Buying frequently spreads your risk. Set-up your automatic purchase on every pay-day if you wish, it won't change anything in the grand scheme of things.  In fact, to more your thinker and try to pick to right day to buy, the more your risk screwing up.
It is much, much more important to diligently invest than to try to game the market
Also: The flesh is weak. 
It's really easy to pull out a chart right now and say : "Wow, I wish I had bought at 6500$ during the november dip!", but people were actually selling at that time (hence why the price was falling).  When bitcoin just lost 20% (and it will happen again), will you be confident enough to throw in your money?
Just pick a day of the week, any day. Set-up an automatic purchase, and you're done
