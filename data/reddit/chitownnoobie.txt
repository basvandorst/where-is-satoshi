I agree, crypto won't be adopted because of a crisis. If anything it'll be adopted for increased utility. Some people are so dilutional.

Any reliable wallet where you control the keys. Unless you know exactly what you're doing, I would wait a few days after the fork and let things settle before transferring coins, etc.

Mycelium and Coinomi. They were absolutely wonderful during the Bitcon Cash fork. I did not have any issues.

Just hodl, I was doing that for a moment as well. Don't sell for a loss unless you absolutely need the cash.

$2496.94 - $2500.00 I don't expect much to change. There should be turbulence in August, however, September should return to what it is now.
