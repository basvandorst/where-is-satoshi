Thanks!  I’ll work on adding another account to the never ending notebook of exchanges

Is anyone disputing this?  It’s not ‘fake news’?
@_date: 2018-01-30 05:54:51
I was charged in dollars.  But you are correct, as I move my life towards crypto, I will have to change that thinking.

After you get into headspace, Consider going to Asia to meditate with the monks.  I went to a meditation retreat in Northern Thailand and learned a lot.  
But my most transforming experience was with a monk in Laos about 4 days ago.  He was 10 years old.  I am absolutely blown away by the experience and the sheer energy I experienced from him.  Oh and he spoke no English

But what if we can retake the word and make it something better?

How much electricity are you expecting to use per month?
Also, if you lose power, what happens to the node when the power turns back on?

I’ve read several definitions.  I’m not satisfied with the current definition.  I’m no expert, but I think we can change a definition of a word simply by getting everyone to believe it. 
So let’s change the definition and make it more positive.   I don’t think the world is ready yet for the coming revolution.  How can we help them see it?

Apparently a large amount is now 1 ETH... is coinbase about to belly up?

Go to the r/BTC subreddit to ask this.  I personally would never dump all my BTC.  It would make more sense to own an equal amount of BCH, but I’m still not yet convinced BCH is going to be more useful.  
BCH has continued to fall in value vs BTC.  The reason I would look to buy it is that the history has continued long sustained falling periods with short spikes in value.  Seems like you could buy some BCH and set a limit order at double your buy in price.  Then sell half that BCH back for BTC.  
The next massive bull run will be when BCH has a chance to take over.  If BTC fees go really high again, that would be BCH’s only chance to gain market share.  (In my opinion)

You actually have to try again if you get it perfect.  “Monsters eat image”
@_date: 2018-06-29 03:09:05
I actually laughed out loud!  Nice

Use cash app.  Lower fees, better company integrity, and less likely you'll stay to buy some scam coin.

I started on sky scanner.  It redirected me to future.travel
@_date: 2017-11-01 06:35:30
Yes, most flights are cheap here.  I don’t mind paying fees because I feel that It is used, the more bitcoin will increase in value.
On the contrary, I could have purchased with a credit card to gain bonus miles and get some sort of trip protection.  I sacrificed those bonuses to learn more about bitcoin, and how fungible it actually is.

Where is the ELI5 on how to setup lightning node?
@_date: 2019-01-20 00:44:18
Super interested.  Following.  Can you point me towards resource to learn more about lightning if I don’t know much about coding and gaff this learned much about how to actually USE ln?

Chapul makes cricket based energy bars.  Decent size brand in the outdoor adventure sports  community. 
@_date: 2019-01-20 22:04:17
Any association with Chapul?

Do not sell to buy a Tesla.   Call Tesla and tell them you are another one of those bitcoin guys who wants to buy a Tesla but will only pay in bitcoin. 
If they continue to get requests from BTC users, maybe they will allow this form of payment.
On another note, what got you into BTC to begin with?  If you thought it was a disruptive tech that will change the world, maybe hold on to most of it.  BTC is most likely to be top dog in the space.  You could also look at the projects that generate returns.  Having a Dash masternode for example, means owning 1000 dash and generates a passive income of dash.  You’ll have to do your own research to decide if Dash is a project that you want to be a part of.

Is this speculation that there may be an advertisement popping the price?
@_date: 2018-11-17 04:30:43
How do you make money with a ln node?  I know it’s from fees...
@_date: 2017-10-18 04:25:38
DM me, I have a proposal for you that intertwines ideas with bitcoin, business, and profiting from Blockchain tech. Regardless of where the price of BTC goes, I expect to be profitable.  But moreso if it goes up.  
@_date: 2019-05-13 15:04:14
No no no no no.  Study more.  LTC is not faster than BTC for anything other than an exchange to exchange transfer when you are trading for shit coins.  
LTC will never replace BTC, the only chance I see in it increasing is when the BTC chain gets a significant backlog or high fees. Unless you are day trading, trying to buy at .012 and sell above .016, to gain more BTC, you're probably doing it wrong.
I want speak about ETH because I believe there are still some hope in that chain. It isn't trying to be money.
Source: I pissed away a lot of my dollars and BTC trying to "diversify"
Diversify on assets outside of blockchain, and have goals pacifically to work towards buying income producing assets.  
Invest in yourself. Whether through courses or time spent continuing to learn about the space. I highly recommend the book the Bitcoin standard, however it is likely written with a bias.
