I got a bonus from work and I opted for a television instead of one bitcoin when it was 5k.... Now my heart dies a little when I watch movies on it.

I spent 300 when it was 6.200, and then 200 when it was 5.600.
No regrets.

Using a Virtual machine would be a good idea?

I was thinking about setting one of my raspberries as a offline wallet. Since electrum  has a command line usage option, I think it would be a good idea since I can backup an encrypted image.
I mean, hardware wallet is cool, but what if i somehow damage it? or lose?

Man, I have adhd, I love dashboards, and as a devops engineer that traded steam summer sales and useless courses from udemy, on this weekend I spent my first "fuck it I belong here" 600 euros.
I mean, I won't miss it for the next 5 years and I don't buy the same amount of games that I used to purchase for the last 2 years.
So fuck it, I know that the future me will thank this decision.
