You can try it yourself, go download electrum, enter your seed, mark it as a bip39 seed and press create wallet. Your keys will be loaded and it won't ask you for any pin or password. It will however ask you to create a new password--&gt; this password is just to access electrum. But your funds are still accessible if you forget the password and import the seed again
Pins and password are just to access the hardware or software it is protecting not the funds itself. Your funds are still accessible only if u know the seed

Why would he ask you to send first? He's someone over the internet who u don't even know. After you send, he will ignore you
Where is is proof that doge will outpace Bitcoin? All you are doing is trusting his word. Look at the price of each individual doge coin now. It's worth less than a penny. One doge will never ever be worth $1. 
You cannot sent dogecoin to a Bitcoin address. I guarantee you if u send him 5btc, you will never see your money ever again

Please do your research on how dogecoins are mined and how many there are and the philosophy behind it. Doge will never be like Bitcoin. Bitcoin was like this because it was the first of its kind and no one believes in it at first. But we know crypto currencies exist and we believe in em now. Doge is no better than any other altcoin. And 25 million doge is worth more than 8 bitcoin. Why would he give you that much for 5? He can just exchange the doge to BTC himself at an exchange and get more BTC. He is trying to make his deal seem very sweet so you can fall prey to his scam

This answer in the FAQ section "8% (eight percent), is applied on every gift, which is added to the amount of bitcoin the sender intends to send. For instance, Chuck wants to send $100 as a gift to his colleague. He fills out the Send form indicating the recipient's email, then sends the equivalent of $108 worth of bitcoins to KryptoGifts wallet (19Cm3ddKvZP11yKVAs59ux5q2xWK4L6mqd) within 20 minutes. KryptoGift then credits recipient with 100 USD."
TLDR; its one bitcoin address in which users send money to; there is no backend system that distinguishes who sent how much to what address. In services like this, each user gets a unique address to send money to ----&gt; this site has one address which everyone sends to. There is no way to calculate how much balance each user has on their own account
@_date: 2017-01-20 20:44:45
beware, i just looked at a site called kryptogift and used fake details.
All requests for funds are sent to one address
there is no way for the site to distinguish different funds coming from different people. all people are asked to send funds to the above address
USUALLY sits like this provide a unique address to each user to distinguish who deposited how much and how much balance is left.

Mining fees and block reward are not the same. the transaction fees you pay for sending coins to be verified are fees. Regardless of the fee you send, miners also get an additional 12.5 BTC on top of everyone's fees. Once the 12.5 halves enough to a negligible amount, miners will still get the transaction fees to solve blocks. Hopefully in time, Bitcoin price will rise enough that these small transaction fees are big enough to cover all the costs of mining and turn a profit

Bitcoin would not be controlled directly, meaning it would still work the way it does. Chinese govt might just make mining illegal/ impose huge fines on miners or make it illegal for Chinese exchanges to take place. Chinese govt can go on local Bitcoin and pretend to buy coins from sellers and fine sellers for selling illegal product. They can't control Bitcoin the technology, but can impose huge fines and make it so difficult for Bitcoiners that it will make people want to avoid it due to the inconvenience

It's normal, just because you can provide a pic of ID, doesn't mean that it is you, the ID could have been faked or you could have asked someone for an ID picture. 
The selfies is to prove the ID matches your face, therefore you are who your ID says you are. The name on the ID is to match the bank account/credit or debit card that sends payment  to prove that it is indeed YOUR bank account sending the funds to the exchange and not a random hacked bank account/card details and the letter is to prove that you did indeed send money to the exchange and understand 100% what you are buying. Therefore you cannot call the bank tomorrow and say "someone hacked my account, please give me money back"
I hope this clarifies everything. Bitcoin is a nonreversible form of payment, yet debit card/credit card, bank transfers are reversible to am extent. Exchanges must be as careful as possible to protect themselves

It depends. Let's say, for example, $1 american equals $1.50 canadian. If hyperinflation happens, $1 american will equal $15.00 canadian, because the canadian dollar value has dropped by 10x.  Now let's pretend Bitcoin is worth $500 american. Pre hyperinflation, it would be worth $750 canadian. Now it is worth $7500 canadian. 
If people are paying $7500 canadian per coin, they are just paying more because their canadian dollar value has dropped. (It takes more canadian dollars to equal an American dollar), if people are paying anywhere above $7500 canadian(let's say $8000 canadian), it is a combination of hyperinflation and demand because of the fear that tomorrow, the canadian dollar value will drop more. 
Now if there was no hyperinflation and the $1 american still equals to $1.50 canadian and people are just paying around $750 canadian mark, maybe more, then it's just demand because the canadian dollar hasn't dropped in value.
But it's a bit complicated because with hyperinflation, comes more demand for stability in a currency and you can't really pinpoint what percentage of a price premium is due to hyperinflation or demand

Hardware wallets sign the transaction on the device itself and never need to have the private key touch the internet. An encrypted wallet (electrum with a password for example) momentarily decrypts your private key to sign the transaction and broadcasts the transaction to the internet, leaving your private decrypted for a split second. Some malware might be smart enough to steal your keys on that brief moment of private key decryption
And the three devices you listed above are a good. It's up to you what you choose but all 3 are similar in performance and security. I personally use keepkey

50 cent fee is too high. Usually the fastest transactions take like 30 cents max. This will almost guarantee your transaction to be in the next block. Any decent fee will put your transaction in the next block or two. If it takes a long time, it has to do with the miners solving blocks and not your fees

Also to say bitcoin is anonymous, it is anonymous enough...though not 100%. Because you are purchasing from an exchange, you have to upload all the documents.

Get a hardware wallet. Is essentially a paper wallet in that it's stored offline but like an software wallet in which people cannot physically see your keys like a paper wallet. And works on numerous desktop and mobile wallets

In your situation, India's currency hasn't dropped any significant value, so it's just mostly demand because more Indians want it. In Chinas case, China devalued the currency due to over printing (inflation- each individual unit of Chinese currency can buy less today than it did last month), people bought Bitcoin to protect from inflation. And this is a demand created for bitcoin

Your coins must be held in a wallet no matter what. You cannot avoid it unless you generate your own private and public key pairs
@_date: 2016-11-29 23:14:32
You can do this, this would mean you need to fulfill the requirements for opening an Indian bank account which many people can't just simply open one.

Nah didn't buy high sell low. I bought low at like the 400 range earlier this year and sold at 850 rather than 890/keep holding. So in a sense. I bought low, sold high but coulda sold higher. But on the bright side, profits still profit!:)

How do most sites get money by offering free services? Ads!

Have you initialized it with the chrome app from the ledger wallet website?

If you don't have a card nor can you meet up and do p2p trades, how do you expect to pay for your coins?
@_date: 2016-12-31 01:50:10
Buying on GDAX is cheaper. You actual go to the market and place a price you wanna pay and match with someone willing to sell it. This is called the market price. However it takes a week for your funds to reach GDAX because they don't take card. 
Coinbase will sell you at market price + a small percentage (I believe under 5%) and it's usually faster than GDAX

Good catch. However if the funds are online, they are hackable but they are insured. If the funds are OFFLINE, they can't be hacked so is there really a need for insurance for unhackable funds? 
This makes me think that All funds (online and off) are safe- online has insurance = safe and offline is cold storage = not hackable and safe. 
I might be over thinking it. If I'm wrong, please help me understand why my logic is wrong
@_date: 2016-12-03 11:15:21
Your a fucking dick dude. Bitcoins will help them because they can swap them out for usd there or protect them from their hyper inflating location as l currency

Nah private keys are one line long. Probs around 30 characters. I'm not sure, just estimating, but it's around that

Please post more details. What was the transaction Id, what address did you send it to? When?

A good way is to buy some��
@_date: 2016-12-31 04:56:32
Circle stopped doing Bitcoin, coinbase is your only option for instant buys but you need a credit card/debit card

Don't waste your money it's a huge scam
@_date: 2017-04-24 18:31:05
Yes. Coinbase will take a while for your purchase to go through though

@_date: 2017-04-23 13:33:44
That's why it's higher. You can't withdraw fiat- only crypto. So if you want your coins out, put a buy order for bitcoin worth 30000 usd and withdraw the coins to your wallet and move em to another exchange and sell them there if you want your money
@_date: 2017-04-25 13:01:38
Wallet backup size seems fine. You can have a set of 12 words that holds millions and millions of dollars in it and be super small

This is a fucking scam

Coinbase is legit- you aren't buying from a person but a reputable company. You will not lose your coins
@_date: 2016-10-30 20:59:08
FAKE! DONT DOWNLOAD THIS! WILL STEAL YOUR FUNDS!

Go on localbitcoins and sell your coins in pieces for a higher margin and when you have enough money, purchase in bulk from an exchange at market rate. Repeat and profit!
@_date: 2016-10-25 07:59:28
Circle and breadwallet are probably using different sources to get exchange rates
@_date: 2016-10-28 22:05:37
You can get Bitcoin at any age. Just work for it or give some cash for it or find someone willing to accept PayPal for it. Bitcoin doesn't have an age limit
@_date: 2016-10-28 20:18:25
Money should be held frozen. Once you prove you own the account, they will process the money. If you decide to not give ID they will unfreeze the money within a couple of days
@_date: 2017-05-13 14:31:11
What you're  missing is that the hacker isn't going to verify who made what funds and return the key to those who paid. He's just gonna sit there and collect the money from whoever was stupid enough to pay
@_date: 2016-10-29 16:02:47
Have you got the right backup? If you swipe over to the transaction history tab, are there any previous transactions with the wallet? If there is previous history, you got the right backup. If it's an empty history, you've probably imported a wrong backup
But if you've used the same exact backup from the first device, your funds are safe
@_date: 2016-10-29 15:00:18
Original backup is the same account. You can put the wallet on an unltd number of devices as long as you backed up the original wallet
@_date: 2017-05-13 03:24:43
Don't remember it. It's too hard. A brain injury will mean you lose access to funds. If your a newbie, write down the words- usually it will be 12 or 24 words. And split em up into chunks of 4 and place them in different physical locations. If a thief finds one paper, it will contain 1/3 or 1/6th of the seed which is absolutely useless for stealing funds
Or write a story where your words are written randomly in the story and u know how to locate em
Or if you're an artist, write the words down on paper in an artsy way and paint around it and blend the words into the painting
Or find a book no one reads, pick a random page and wrote your seed in it.

FAKE, DO NOT DOWNLOAD! THIS WILL STEAL YOUR FUNDS!!
@_date: 2017-05-13 02:58:10
When you initialize a hardware wallet for the first it it will randomly generated a multi word "seed" aka multi word password. Write this down. Once you enter your "seed aka password on another wallet, your money is automatically restored. Bitcoins aren't attached to the physical hardware wallet but the seed. Hardware wallet just store the seed and cannot be "pulled off it"
@_date: 2016-10-28 20:25:25
Yeah. I don't know if they even took the money out. Most of the time, money is still in your bank, it's just "frozen" there unable for you to use for other transactions. It will be "unfrozen" after a few days should you not provide proof of bank ownership/card ownership
@_date: 2017-05-13 14:34:03
Don't install a custom ROM on a phone you used bitcoins on. With root access, apps have the ability to view your seed
@_date: 2016-10-25 20:05:43
I've been using copay for a few months now,...also released by Bitpay. Either this article is wrong or I've been using a fake copay wallet the whole time...(though nothing has went wrong yet, so I'm assuming my wallet is real...)
@_date: 2017-05-13 02:37:06
If u carry all your cash with you lose it, it's gone for good. If you carry millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin in a hardware wallet and lose it. Just restore you wallet on another wallet with your seed and you get your money back...
