Depends on the model. Today's latest model would have certainly depreciated by 2037  so it would cost way less than $420k 2019s buying power. Of course dollar figure can be higher  depending on dollar inflation rate but today's lambos would certainly be less valuable by that time.

Yeah but if you sell all of it now, you only get 2 more years financially free after that then what? I say only sell what you need, and try to get some support from relatives or whatever. You only need time to pass if you really believe bitcoin will be worth a fortune one day.

Yeah sure you can buy and hodl almost a good percentage of all bitcoins back then. But if you did the key people that pushed bitcoin and made it for what it is today may be turned off and not have a chance to get in with you hoarding a good chunk of all the coins. So you'll be bag holding a currency which nobody uses. I guess this is why winklevoss twins limit their holdings to 1% of all the coins when I think they can easily buy or trade till they get 10% or more.

You can buy mine for 1 million usd a coin if you're really desperate.

IMO you need to invest at least a five figure sum or buy 1 btc if you want a shot in a million dollars in return within the next decade and that is still quite a moon shot maybe 25% chance it can happen. Don't expect to get rich off $5 dollars or any pocket money maybe it can grow to a significant amount but not anywhere near a million realistically.

If no one can spend it then it is considered lost. Consider them martyrs as they make your coins more valuable by scarcity. If you own 1 bitcoin today and someone just died with 100btc taking it to their grave, unspendable, then you will be 9 cents richer at today's prices.

If he just destroyed the private key/laptop instead of giving it to the fbi, there will be less 140k bitcoin in circulation or 0.8% of all bitcoins. If you own 1 bitcoin today you'll be $150 richer without those coins in circulation considering the current price/supply...
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:12:08
Nope, you use their service for bitcoin when you signed up, you are at their mercy on all these forks. You should've cashed out to your own wallet if you knew there would be one.
And there might be too many shitforks that can be created and it is becoming a nuisance at some point like all the thousands of altcoins out there. They could've dumped bcash and claim all the profits to themselves and it will still be the right thing to do since you never signed up for bcash when you register.

@_date: 2017-12-23 23:59:06
What do you mean "congested"? You just reduced the supply by people dying and the coin is divisible to 100 million digits and can be easily modified to be more divisible. The entire network can technically run on only 1 bitcoin.
Also fewer supply means it takes less money to pump the price. You can look at the joke coin 42 coin, 42 coins supply but over 50k usd per coin, only a few gullible buyers are enough to raise the price sky high. And there is not enough supply to drop it to 0 and you need sellers and supply to crash a coins value.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:42:35

Lost coins are not a problem to begin with, they are a feature to make sure you'll be responsible with your coins and scarcity is guaranteed.
And this violates the very principle of bitcoin to be your own bank, if your will is to pass on your wallet for many generations or put it in a time capsule, there should be no reason it disappears just for being inactive since that is your money and it is your will to let them be inactive for years.

It's not easy, most would have sold their bitcoins on the past bubbles mania and despair phase. And many will sell theirs in the upcoming bubbles, so true holders get rewarded for surviving all the fud and the hordes of haters.

Bitcoin is the pioneer and the trendsetter, if it fails every altcoin will most likely fail regardless of its "technology". You can see it whenever bitcoin price tanks or increases, almost all altcoins follow it eventually.
And it won't go to 1 dollar simply because of scarcity. Even the shit  coin "42 coin", 42 coins in supply is currently worth 56k usd per coin. simply because there is not enough supply and a few idiots can push the price that high.
Though if you want to sell bitcoins for a dollar a piece I'll easily buy 10k, and you can consider those lost till we get 100k usd a piece.
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:11:02

Depends on how much you are holding imo. If it is a life changing amount of money then definitely get a hardware wallet one asap as you can't predict if you'll get hacked or the online wallets you store your bitcoins goes down. And you can't really be too paranoid for high amounts.
 If it is just pocket money at current prices I guess you can take a risk and wait for the price to go down or find a cheaper alternatives to store your coins.

I'm not selfish, donate to everybody by diminishing the supply: 1BitcoinEaterAddressDontSendf59kuE
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:10:58
Why also not 42 coin? 42 coins in circulation and 59k currently per coin.
 
And you ask why price is high, it is simply because of scarcity. The fewer the supply the fewer money it is needed to pump the value up.
Bitcoin may not end up mainstream and end up becoming a niche currency but doesn't mean the value won't reach high prices or even 1 million dollars a coin, if there is enough lost coins and there is still demand from the hardcore few, then it can reach that price. The same logic applies to baseball cards, you may not want to pay a hundred grand for a rare baseball card if you don't know anything about baseball at all but for the hardcore fans they will and since there is few supply it will reach sky high prices.
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:58:19
Then just buy their coins if a whale sells off...
You technically only need 15 btc to be in the 1% of bitcoin holders, that's only like $255000 today, your average millionaire can still buy their spot easily. Unlike in the fiat world, you can not easily get the top 1% spot, you earn a dollar the billionaire earns a hundred and so on. They can print money since it is infinite and leverage you away from their 1% spot, not in bitcoin once a whale dumps everybody gets a chance to get a piece of that position since bitcoins are scarce and it might not be easy for a whale to buy back if majority holds or sells at a higher price and there is still demand.
And those in the richest addresses are from exchanges, owned by a lot of people. And you also forgot to factor 4 million coins that are lost forever and that number is increasing due to human errors which is unavoidable.﻿
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:48:16

No you bought at 16k and you get what is on 16k. If the price was 20k right now you wouldn't want to cancel. I hope it drops even further to 8k or even 1k so guys like you will feel the agony that we long term hodlers felt during all the bubbles and be forced to sell.

For every all time high, technically no holders lost anything unless they sold lower than their buy in price. If you believe the last all time high of 20k will be the final top price of bitcoin forever and it will be nowhere near it again and only down hill from now onwards, then you made the right choice selling everything and you will be the first and only batch of buyers to profit from the final all time high, which no one did so far for the entire history of bitcoin.

Yeah 1 btc might not be enough right now. But there is a certain amount of btc that you might want to quit your job if you're just in it for the money and have no passion for it at all. And that btc number is certainly getting lower over the years...
And bitcoin only fired people who sold at a loss not those who hodl over the years!

Gonna be an epic dump once they decided to sell it all, I wonder how low the price can go. Though I would rather see those coins lost.
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:43:09
There is basically no risk for them since they are rich to begin with, if bitcoin fails they lose their initial 11 million dollars and that's it, which is probably just a small part in their fortune and they are already prepared to lose it in the first place. It's like losing a chance to buy an extra 100 lambo when you already have 10.
And their life goals are probably different from the average joe, they are not holding just to buy a house, they are holding to make an economic influence like a modern day Rockefeller.

Gonna up those rookie numbers if you want a chance to be a millionaire, I say try to get at least 1 bitcoin if you want something life changing and that will still be moonshot but your chances are vastly greater than playing the lottery.

Give me free bitcoins if you think it is worthless. And I'll make sure they will never circulate again till price is so much higher than today.
I am quite sure value won't go down to 0 simply because of the scarcity. You need people selling for the price to crash and as more people get their share it gets harder to synchronize the crash and some people just leave or forget their coins rather than sell at a loss. Even the shit coin "42 coin", 42 coins in supply, is currently valued at 36000 simply because there is not enough supply and a few gullible buyers are enough to make the price go high.
And bitcoin will always be a shadow of the blockchain technology it pioneered, and that won't go away anytime soon.
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:18:50
Well you can do the same argument to million dollar paintings, antiques and collectibles. The point is, it doesn't matter what YOU want, what matters is what the market wants and demands.
I could care less about properties if I don't like the place then that property is worth zero for me personally but if there is external market demand then it has a minimum value regardless of what I value it but if I'm the only one in the market that property will be worth zero.
Another example is the most expensive painting salvator mundi, which is probably worthless to 99.99% of the world's population who doesn't even know about it. But since there is a handful of people willing to pay over a million and the top guy wants to pay 400 million, then so be it, it will be priced that high since it is also unique and the only one in the world. It doesn't matter if the painting is stupid or not, useless or useful. And that small group of wealthy people uses paintings as store of wealth. Don't see the reason why this can't also be the case for bitcoin.

you can carry bitcoin on your head with the private key, can't beat that no mass! 


bitcoin is a decentralized one, much better!


it doesn't matter eventually. this is like ancient egyptian symbolism, average joe in the modern times doesn't give a damn.






Bitcoin isn't any form of matter, so technically it is much better than matter based store of value. Since it is indestructible till you destroy all servers all around the world, which is like destroying the world in the first place.


That's the problem, average joe can't get any gold because banks want it all for themselves.


bitcoin is deflationary, can't get any better than that.


You can send bitcoin to anyone at any amount, no need identification and other bullshit papers. How liquid can you get.

I'm quite sure their crypto stockpile is virtually riskless investment for the people running their state.

He can still hold it for longer if he comes back and btc is in a bear market (a good probability it will be as bull runs especially the parabolic ones are short and bear markets are longer), unless he lost his keys btc will still be there and the network is  unlikely to disappear as a whole. And as he said, he can live without the money so even a 10 year hold gives good odds of profit. Though it would suck to know if it got to 300k and crash to 30k without taking and enjoying some profits and rebuying the crash.
@_date: 2019-03-06 21:38:14
For those non-customers of those exchange, it's better that they were lost forever as that makes the supply scarcer technically making the rest of bitcoin holders slightly richer. Now because of these shady events it seems like these coins are stolen and dumped, not only the customers lost money and it also didn't make the supply scarcer, and maybe dumped and made the price lower.

@_date: 2019-11-16 17:18:41
It's currently 16k per coin even almost at rank 1000. It can't dump to 0 because nobody has that kind of bag! Most are probably lost by former exchanges that hosted it or holders who got bored due to 3 year bear market after 2014. Even small buy orders can raise the price by 1000s. The only way for decentralize coins to die is nobody uses it, exchanges stop trading it and no nodes or miners are running the network. All those conditions must be met, unless the coin is rigged with infinite premine the price is very unlikely to 0. If the coin gets scarcer then time is on your side especially if the network is huge like bitcoin as it gives more confidence there will always be trade and price, and there is a certain bottom price point that will never be broken. This is what most people don't get about scarcity.
@_date: 2019-03-06 19:01:59
Well, that's the sell signal right there as it will most likely drop to $2k as the market is unreasonable and most likely won't follow common sense.

It doesn't need to be a world's primary currency anyway as long there is a community using it, it will have value and will continue to exist. The deflationary nature of it means it will take less volume of money to maintain the price in the future. Of course everytime bitcoin nears all time high or does a parabolic move, it attracts the hoarde of noobs simply through greed fueling the bubble and creating a new batch of hodlers when it pops thereby increasing the deflation rate again.

The ones who still holds/controls most of the fiat money are the older generations, and it is still not hard for them to enter the 1% by just buying 2-3 btc. And I doubt there is a lot of teens who are investing money on the early days, it is most likely guys in their late 20s, 30s and above. It will most likely the millennials and the younger generations who will pump the price, if btc will still be a thing, since btc will be a lot more scarce when they get more money to invest.

Look at bit20 is already over 200k on coinmarketcap and also 42coin at 21k a coin, sh1tcoins with no psych factor! IMO bitcoin only needs to exist long enough to break 100k, simply because of scarcity it will take less volume of money in the future for the price to be stable, of course once it nears an all time high it attracts the hoarde of noobs simply through greed pumping the price further till the bubble pops creating a new batch of hodlers with some noobs probably forgetting the coin further increasing the scarcity, distribution and lesser the volume of money needed for the new "higher normal" price to be stable...

Depends also on your age, if you're a teen or in early 20s you can afford to put all your savings into bitcoin, time is on your side even in the very unlikely event bitcoin flops. Even some sh1tcoins from 2014 still exist today. It may become a niche or a widespread currency but I am sure bitcoin will still exist in 10 or 20 years given its almost 10 year track record and the community and infrastructure behind it. On what price though is unknown, but I am sure it will HAVE value rather than completely 0.
@_date: 2018-10-17 06:49:26
On a bear market most people will just reply "sounds like a scam", "that's not money", "it is used by criminals", "seems like a ponzi/pyramid scheme" etc...
On a bull/hype Market they ask, "how much bitcoins do you have?", "how much money did you made already?", "how do you buy bitcoins?". Then they'll buy at the top of the bubble and when it pops and they lose money they'll blame you for it. So yeah, best is to just stay silent...
@_date: 2018-10-20 01:53:51
But when it drops to "attainable" levels will you still buy it? Chances are there will be so much FUD and "bitcoin is dead" news that most people wouldn't even put a single cent on it despite pouring thousands when it was overpriced during the hype.

Right, you go first. Better yet, I suggest sending the bitcoins you bought to the genesis address in honor of satoshi, so it will be in the ultimate HODL!
@_date: 2018-10-28 21:09:00
Market cap is just imaginary anyway, it is simply price x supply. Also doesn't factor lost bitcoins and market volume. If you have 1 million btc, it doesn't mean you'll get 6 billion dollars if you sell it all you'll push the price way down and you'll get a lot less dollars, also works vice versa you won't get 1 million btc for 6 billion because you'll push up the price. I doubt there is even 3 billion real dollars worth of liquidation on btc, Very few are just selling at low prices that's why little money is needed to maintain the price. Almost the same for those nameless shi1tcoins on top 100-500, you won't get millions of dollars even if you own 90% of the supply, some of them probably have a few thousand dollars worth of liquidation.
@_date: 2018-10-17 06:03:41
It should be around 4000 in 2019 and around 5000 in Aug 2020. Yup, ready to be downvoted for telling the most likely reality...
@_date: 2019-11-04 16:23:43
That's actually good for everyone except your heirs that suppose to receive it. Less btc in circulation (one less selling/dumping) = less money/fiat needed to maintain or raise the price. I'd say take it to the grave, they'll most likely be living fine and well even without those btc and long after you're forgotten by your descendants. Just let them buy and hold themselves so it will teach them frugality and patience.
@_date: 2018-10-29 13:48:59
It won't go to 0 in at least a century I'm certain of that. The decentralized nature means user base has to go to 0 too for the value to be nothing, btc can go down from millions of users to 100 users and still HAVE value, scarcity also guarantees that. You can simply look at sh1tcoins from 2014 on the top 500+ some of them are still alive and only kept running by few gullible buyers and a couple of thousand dollars, they still have value although small liquidity but not 0.
@_date: 2018-10-03 08:23:13
Then just buy the same amount today and price only needs to get up another 6000 instead of 12k for you to break even!

Why only 10k? Up it by a million BTC and crash the market.
@_date: 2018-10-18 20:09:38
I'd say treat it as if it were 20x the current value. It would really suck if you would have lost that amount and a bull run starts and you don't have spare money to replace the lost amount immediately and you'll be chasing prices and be on regret you were so careless you lost the btc you bought when it was cheaper.

It was just a rough division between the total number of maximum bitcoins to the current world population. 
20 years is a long time, Bitcoins will be much more scarce in terms of ratio to the population in 20-30 yrs if it still exist. Assuming no massive disasters happen, world is projected to have 10 billion people. Not to mention, the accumulated lost coins in all those years and the hodlers that would have probably died and taken their btc to the grave.

Well there you go, bitcoin has achieved its goal. High volatility is no excuse no more not to invest, its a stable price, low fees, a usable currency and a new safe haven for investors. You invested because of the technology and to get away from the evil dollar not because of lambo gains right?
@_date: 2018-10-05 10:58:30
Well you can always make that number lower by simply buying bitcoins and sending it to an unspendable address, like satoshi's genesis address.
You will also make us all richer by doing this sacrifice, eg. buy 10000 bitcoins then send to unspendable address then you make the holders of at least 1 btc around 5 dollars richer by today's price/supply. May god bless you to anyone who would do this, you are a martyr of satoshi indeed!
@_date: 2018-10-28 05:12:21
2 btc would cost $360 at minimum on 2014 and that is if you bought at the very bottom and very short dip of 180 per bitcoin from 1100 on q4 2013. You already need to invest a significant 4-5 digits back then for lambo gains this year.

The chart still holds, the error bar seems to be one or half an order of magnitude. It should have been 5k on 2015 but it was off by half a magnitude like it did on mid 2012 and got over it on 2011, 2013 and 2017. The chart will be invalidated if btc is still 10k or below at the end of 2021...
@_date: 2017-08-10 23:55:13
unlikely for now but as long as there is demand it is only a matter of time, maybe in  50-100 years it is possible 10m per coin, when the dollar has lost lots of its present value and btc becomes really scarce, by that time I guess lots of bitcoins have also been lost like lost wallets, owners dying and taking the keys to their grave etc... And if there is still such demand and no one dumping, it can reach that price. It may or may not happen but I guess owning just 1 btc gives you better chances of being a usd millionaire someday than playing the lottery for years...

And I can see it being made into a treasure hunter movie, "indiana jones and the lost 7500 btc" or "da vinci code, bitcoin chronicles"...

More like "money you're willing not to touch for years". I don't think you can lose money anymore with bitcoin, as in 100% of investments go to zero. Bitcoin already surpassed the fad phase and has an almost 10 year track record, so most likely Bitcoin will still exist in the next decade and it will have some value regardless. Not to mention the supply just gets scarcer over time, so it takes less money volume to maintain the price even if it does not go mainstream. Heck even some shitcoins from 2014 still exist. If bitcoin fails mainstream adoption, it will most likely become a niche currency and will still have some value rather than cease to exist and go to zero.

with a such scarce supply there is a limit on what can be dumped. It will probably drop to 1k-1.5k at max on despair stage then plateau for a long time on 2k-4k if it ever reaches a bubble of 10k and above. Till we get on to the next bubble after the next halving, hopefully we'll see 100k then drop to 10k... Though I don't mind a 100 dollar btc again, I'll buy shitloads if it crashes that low.

Hodling does lower the required amount of volume of money to maintain or pump the price because of technically increasing scarcity. You can already see this effect on super scarce sh1tcoins, like 42 coin currently priced 24k, only a few thousand dollars and a handful of schmucks are enough to maintain the price simply because of scarcity.

The market cap is an illusion, there really isn't 200 billion dollars on this market. You do know that it's just a calculation of the highest bid x supply. Where the highest bid has a limit and also the supply. Also one can create a sh1tcoin with and with even a few thousand dollars of buy order on the highest bid it will create a multi-million dollar market cap out of thin air that can easily disappear when that bid is retracted. Also same for the volume, whales can just moves funds back and forth creating the illusion. You can just go to the top 300-1000 coins on coinmarketcap some of these are unheard of and they're worth "millions" of dollars. Also with supply getting scarce, it will also take lesser fiat money to maintain or raise the price over time. A real 200 billion dollar pump on btc right now will easily take it to new all time high and maybe even at least 10x from current price.
@_date: 2019-06-21 02:41:11
I'll give it a couple of hundred years and that price could actually be possible. Bitcoin only needs to exist, and it will be super scarce by then and many coins have cumulatively lost via dead holders and carelessness alone. Lost coins are also harder to put back into circulation as they can't be 'discovered' by accident without the key unlike physical money. Not to mention fiat (if still used) would have inflated so much by then, that a thousand dollars is just a price of a bigmac.

Well I heard the CEO of Quadrica died taking the cold coins with him, so those coins are gone forever unless they're trying to exit scam, they've should at least made the cold storage address public so everyone would know that funds aren't moving. On the bright side if you're still a hodler, the coin supply just got more scarcer technically making your stash slightly more valuable.
@_date: 2019-02-03 05:44:58
It takes less dollars or fiat money though to maintain or raise the price, with lesser coins in circulation as there will be no one to dump those lost coins. Not to mention there is also halvenings that guarantees long term scarcity, so far all followed by a price rise a year later likely proves this theory.
And there will always be buyers for bitcoin as it has use cases. It will attract new people again once price creeps up via greed or once they've seen their friends who bought cheap getting rich, new noobs will join to fuel another bubble. If there is enough greedy idiots that buy lottery tickets, a multi-billion dollar industry, there will be enough idiots again that will buy the next all time high bubble.
@_date: 2017-11-22 02:22:29
Would you still buy 1btc for a million dollars and what's your reasoning behind it? If the answer is yes and you have a good reason to do so, then it will most likely reach that price.
Price depends on what people are willing to pay for it, heck even stupid paintings reach hundreds of millions of dollars only because someone is willing to pay for it...

But that also means they can't be dumped anymore to affect the price. Coins only need to get lost regularly and price will rise against fiat even if volume stays the same.

Bitcoin mining will always be profitable, might not apply to all but there will be people who will profit otherwise hashrate will be 0. When the weak miners capitulate the difficulty will drop making it more profitable for the remainder who are still mining or those who want to start mining, regardless of btc price or block reward. It's a self feeding loop. But there might be a limit of profitable initial capital. I doubt difficulty can get so low that mining it on a commercial gpu will be profitable again that anybody can mine it, you're still gonna need serious money, hardware and very cheap power to get in the btc mining game.

Bitcoin doesn't even need $21 trillion to be $1m in price, maybe a pump of $500 billion is enough to pump it to $1m for a day. And current liquidity is low, I doubt there is even real $10 billion dollars in the current market, even a few million dollars of buy or sell can noticeably affect the price. 
Also there are already millions of lost coins which will never be sold and they only go up over time due to carelessness, holders dying etc... Fiat volume can stay the same as it get scarcer, price will eventually rise as no one will sell and the buying pressure will adjust to the fiat inflation. Bitcoin only needs to exist and maintain interest long enough and it will eventually get there, whether that's on your lifetime, who knows...
@_date: 2019-06-08 20:42:58
Even if it gets full adoption, bitcoin is still scarce and value can still increase. If someone lost it or holder dies and no one else has key then everybody coins gets slightly more valuable and no one can accidentally recover it unlike physical money or just be taken by the banks on dormant accounts. And this just accumulates over time. More adoption or distribution = more chance of the coins getting lost forever.
@_date: 2019-06-26 06:43:31

Don't forget that bitcoin also gets scarcer over time ie. dead holders, lost bitcoins, reward halvenings etc... Those will never be sold forever, that'll only mean it'll take less fiat to maintain or raise the price in the future not to mention there is a fiat inflation so there will be more fiat money in circulation in the future relative to 2017's ath. $20k will be reached again it's only a question of when as long as bitcoin exist, it already happened so it's not an impossibility. Whether $250k in just 3 years is possible depends on how it gets to $20k first.

Unlike gold and silver, bitcoin has a known hard limit tough and its economy is still small and has a pretty low liquidity. Also people lose their coins all the time, like that quadrigacx CEO that just died and unlike gold someone can't just take it without the keys so they're gone in circulation forever minimizing the dollars or fiat needed to maintain or raise the price, not to mention there is also mining halvenings that guarantees scarcity on long term. Of course once price rises it attracts people via greed like flies and that creates another bubble, distributing it more and making it again more scarce when it pops.

The death of that CEO is very shady and there is no proof of address of those cold wallets, so everyone can see that funds aren't moved. This should be easy to obtain to anyone that has access to their servers or hot wallet logs. These coins roughly 0.15% of current supply will probably get dump soon, is being dumped right now or has already been, and the CEO is living a fresh new rich life at some tropical island.
If it is truly lost though then it is bad news for those had funds on exchange and good news for the rest of hodlers. It takes less fiat money now to maintain or raise the price, if you hold 1 btc it makes you around 5 dollars richer with current 3400 price.

With bitcoins being lost or not, the dollar is still much worth more psychologically for majority of people on the cryptospace and outside otherwise the 2017 bubble wouldn't have popped and stayed above 20k which at that time there were no major lost bitcoins, it was just pure psychology that brought the price down.
And with bitcoins getting lost forever and scarcer it takes also less dollars or fiat to maintain or raise the price since there will be no one to dump those coins. Once price rises again significantly though it attracts people again like flies via greed or once they've seen their friends who bought cheaper getting richer, this is almost guaranteed. If there are people dumb enough to buy the lottery, a multi billion dollar industry, there will be enough people to fuel the next bubble and be buying at all time highs.

That's bad if you're a die hard holder wanting to pass your coins to your descendants.
I think current model is great, it teaches people to be careful and take responsibility for their coins. It also insures scarcity, coin supply will only diminish over time due to lost coins. This teaches people to save than to spend carelessly.

Then I'll try to absorb all btc at 0.01 cent a piece so it won't go to 0, then I'll make sure those btc won't be in circulation. With a now much smaller coin supply it is much more easier and takes little fiat to pump btc back into 8k.

If he ever sells or when a big bitcoin holder sells you have the opportunity to buy a portion of his position thereby spreading the wealth. The ones in control in the fiat world will just pump more money, still holding their position and keeping the masses in the illusion they have "more" but in reality they can afford less with more money in circulation.

Well you've got a cool 500 dollars off your 100 dolllars investment. Still a good 5x return. For that to happen right now bitcoin needs to go from 8k to 40k. It also distributes bitcoin so it doesn't stay at the hands of a very few. Don't be greedy, spread the wealth!

It doesn't actually need 21 trillion dollars, if no one sells below 1 million and demand is still high it will reach that price. Price is mostly 
 on the supply and what people are willing to pay for.
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:37:34
doesn't need to have 21 trillion dollars in supply as long as someone is willing to pay 1 million for a bitcoin and there is demand for it. And you also have to understand 1 bitcoin is incredibly rare and will only get rarer. To begin with we will never have all 21 million coins in circulation as most are lost during its early days.

btc price has to be in the millions and growing more than you can spend monthly, if you plan to retire on only 1. 
1m usd will last you at max 27 years if you spend 3k a month, it might be even less accounting inflation and other unexpected spending like emergencies and hospitalization, if you get an expensive chronic disease it can really wipe you out even if you millions in the bank.

Never go all out regardless of profits, it's just as bad as going all in with everything you can lose. Especially if you don't plan to initially spend 100% of them and plan to keep savings in fiat. Always keep some teeth in the game.
Even when you achieved your goals and bought a house or whatever stuff you want, it'll feel good at first but eventually familiarity will set in and you'll eventually get bored with it and you'll have nothing to look forward to since you've gone all out and price may have risen again and it will get harder to get in and have the same profits again.

You can never be too careful or paranoid anyway. Wealth does change majority of people's personality, attitude and how they treat you, strangers, friends, family or loved ones it doesn't matter. What she is now might not be the same if she founds out your entire stash and if in case it appreciated in value in the future.

I'll just keep most of my savings on crypto if I were you since you have total control of it till you're 18 you and can have your own bank.

It matters! If it drops 2k the chances of me losing 90% of my investment is slim, it needs to go to 200 and it most likely won't do that because btc is scarce, while the chance of tripling my money if it goes back up to 6k is high, since it already stayed there for a year and wouldn't take that much money volume to get back up as btc becomes scarcer. And once it goes to 2k to 6k you can take out your principal and let the rest ride on virtually risk free investment.

@_date: 2018-11-14 00:46:48






As the market grows dumps will be less dramatic as well as the gains, as it gets harder to synchronize more holders to dump, it went from 1100 to as low as 180 on the 2013 bubble an 85% drop. A 70% drop from 20k to 6k seems reasonable for the 2017 bubble. The next bubble will probably  take us to 100-150k then drop to around 50-60% of whatever the peak value is and that will be the bottom bear market, and that is a conservative estimate.
@_date: 2019-01-25 17:40:35
Depends on your status in life, for most people on developing countries $4k is already a yearly income even for professionals. Even that amount is hard to save for most middle class families on first world countries with the cost of living getting more expensive.

@_date: 2018-11-23 06:47:34
He could've also got out at 1k that's more than double the principal and will take you ages on a regular investment. I guess it depends on your price target and how long you wanna wait.

@_date: 2018-11-03 11:24:27
Well you can still try to get 1 btc while it's currently easier than becoming a usd millionaire. There will be more millionaires in the future via inflation and will eventually lose its  prestige.

Yeah, but it would be more awesome if he had sold all at 15k+ and bought back his original btc today, he would have 100 btc plus over a million dollars. Still a big mistake IMO, so much greed, provided he's been sitting on it since 2013 and a million dollars isn't even enough.
@_date: 2019-01-28 00:17:02
Bad idea IMO, not just friends even your parents or any family member can still screw you. They're still people in the end and they might not be into crypto but that is still money, if it turns into a significant sum one day, they might just remove you out of the picture. It is almost the same as giving them your coins while alive and have full decision as yours. Personally I'll keep it for myself, and if I die it's gone forever making bitcoin more scarce, people that you left behind will have the things you've already bought anyway and unless you're a famous person you'll be forgotten in like 100 years or less but your bitcoins will always be unmoved in the blockchain forever!

Well I hope it's not 100% of your portfolio and you still have some juice to keep business going. I don't even understand how you can trust exchanges with than kind of amount of money for some small % gains. Since the existence of bitcoin virtually all exchanges has suffered some sort of "hack" or will shutdown at some point the only question is when and not if. I won't be even surprised if the top 10 exchanges today won't be alive any more in 5 years as most of the top 10 exchanges 5 years ago aren't alive today.

Then why wait, sell me some btc at 750 usd today and I'll gladly buy it! And I'll never even dump it at current price.
You do realize there is a 21 million limit and you need sellers who OWN it in order for it to drop, even super scarce shitcoins like 42coin on coinmarketcap is currently 16k usd a coin because nobody even has a full coin and a few thousand dollars from gullible buyers are enough to push that price that high.

You're already gonna have trouble getting satoshi's coins and all the millions of lost coins, it's gonna be a massive treasure hunt. And you need to convince every single holder/miner to sell or give you their coins, from the Winklevoss, Mcafee, Tim Draper down to your basement dweller neighbor who owns a few satoshis. To top it off you need to live till 2140 for the last bitcoin in order for your collection to be complete. Good luck catching them all!

You can also send your btc to an unspendable address like sathoshi's genesis address, and that will be the ultimate HODL because you're never gonna sell them ever! Only need 21 million martyrs to buy 1 full coin and destroy it, and you can be one!

sell now if you really need the money. bitcoin will most likely be always here for you to buy regardless of price. Even if you buy at a higher price doesn't mean you won't make the same profits again. It may go 1 million dollars per coin in 20 years but a lot can happen in that time, it may seem very easy to hold for a long time but it is actually very hard to do with all the financial needs you'll be having for that time period.

Well you're not required to buy the entire coin and you can buy fractions of it, just like gold you can buy in grams instead of 1 ton which is like ~40 million usd today. And with high price and scarcity can make it stable and be a good hedge against fiat which is almost guaranteed to lose half it's purchasing value every 25-30 years due to inflation...
@_date: 2017-10-22 00:12:05


A million dollars is a good money today, but not necessarily big it makes you 'financially free' in the future too. Unwanted events like natural disasters and chronic illness in one of your family can still wipe you out. Not to mention if your business endeavors don't work out, like if no one rents the house, catches a fire or the place becomes worthless at some point, you need an exit and a plan b and that might need cash.
And to top it all of there is inflation, if you do nothing with your cash in hand with little or 0 interest and if you live long enough you might find it one day your $1m dollars only can buy half of what it used to be.

@_date: 2019-09-18 12:42:32
There's only 21 million btc so sending some to a black hole will make the rest of the accessible coins more valuable. And it will take less fiat money to raise or maintain the price and also this guarantees there will be a certain price point or buy order that will never be filled since the supply just gets scarcer. So someone's lost is technically a holder's gain if he or she has still access to their coins.

\&gt; If the shopkeeper instead says, I'm going to cut each loaf into 10 pieces so that everyone can have bread..that's great. But now there is no reason for a bidding war and the price should stay flat.
Nope, there is still reason for a bidding war as everyone will still be hungry and the one who can buy most will be the least hungry. And still a tenth of a loaf of bread is not the same as full one.
\&gt; Unlike with bread, Bitcoin has no actual value. Bread can be used for sustanance, and also goes nice with butter or jam.
Well this is another topic, namely "value" not  scarcity or divisibility but anyway since you opened it up. Value is just relative to persons trading it. A bread might have value to you because you can eat it, but what if a person or a population exists whose allergic to it, then it is technically worthless for them, trade your bread to this population and they'll give you nothing for it but if they sell you a loaf of bread you'll pay because it has value to you and you can eat it. And wonder why some expensive paintings costs millions of dollars while some talented guy on the street that probably spent the same or more effort gets only a few bucks. And also wonder why water is cheap and sometimes free but without it you'll die but oil is currently more expensive than water but you can live without it and people have done so for hundreds of years before the automobile era. So go figure...
\&gt; With a single loaf, you can experience this goodness 12 times. With Bitcoin, whether you have a full coin, or just a partial coin, you are still a chump.
Well might as well divide your loaf of bread to infinity, so you'll never get hungry!
@_date: 2019-05-14 22:21:26
It depends on the price, timeline and how long you can hold, people buying at 1k on 2013 were called retards by a lot of people even most in the crypto community, people buying right now would be 7-8x more retarded than the people that bought it at 1k in 2013 if we would go back to that year. But right now if you would have bought at 1k you would have been considered a "genius" or 200 iq.
@_date: 2018-12-06 00:55:29
It is still pretty much speculative at that price. And it is also easier to manipulate the price at low values and low supply. Instead of needing millions of dollars for pump and dumps, it probably only takes thousands to pump a 10 dollar bitcoin then dump it into a couple of dollars or a few cents.

Well people love it when they see others fail and are proven right. It is also a coping mechanism for the missed profits from the previous bubble, "See, I was right all along and the bubble popped, glad I did not invest any money on it". But in reality they missed a 2x to a 20x profit from the start of the bubble from 1k for a year, so they bargain this logic by comparing the ath price of the bubble to the lowest price since it popped.

Value might be decided by people's imaginations, but there's a 21 million limit on bitcoin. If someone or a bunch of people is willing to pay 10 billion usd on a 2k bitcoin and only a million is in circulation, then that will never be filled and btc will be locked at 2k forever unless the order disappears or they buy the coins of the sellers selling at high prices. Point is, the lower the price, the scarcer bitcoin gets, the lower of money volume is also needed to "lock" bitcoin price at some point so it will never go down.
@_date: 2019-05-29 03:57:23
Bitcoin would probably need a lot less money just to pump it to $1M, the market cap is just a calculation of highest bid x supply. Highest bid has a limit and not all coins are in circulation (those that are in hold long term plus lost coins). You can't liquidate a couple of billion dollars worth of btc without affecting the price noticeably (unless of course someone with a couple billion dollars worth of btc agrees to sell it to you privately), same as buying it. Someone with a billion dollars can probably pump btc to over 10k and beyond right now if bought on exchanges and this would raise the market cap by many more billions of dollars than the actual money used to pump it.

Whose gonna even bother selling at zero? Basically spending some effort to get nothing. Like I don't even bother to pick up a penny or a dime on a street, and that has value but too small to be even worth the effort for me to pickup.

You don't need to buy a whole btc you can buy it in fractions. Remember $8k btc is already out of reach for many people, you're either a hardcore bitcoiner or rich that 8k is nothing to you and well above your risk tolerance to have 1 btc now. Even accumulating 0.1 now would be an accomplishment eventually that can turn to 0.01 or 1 million satoshis. And 10 years is a very long time in the crypto world, I won't be surprised if we have 3-4 parabolic moves again in the next decade.

It really isn't profitable to mine for most of the time especially bear markets. You gotta have the ability to operate at a loss and have faith that btc will rise in value over time.

Problem is he bought shitcoins, most of them will be forgotten and dead in a few years. Only bitcoin has proven staying power for almost a decade and surviving the most bubbles so far.

Bitcoin price also doesn't give a f*ck about your son, I hope you're investing your remaining life savings wisely...

This also means it will take less fiat money to maintain the price as bitcoin gets scarcer in case people lose interest. Of course that is unlikely, since it will be also easier to raise the price and can attract new people via greed alone.

Why wait till 1700 when you can also wait till it's under 100? Long story short, nobody knows what the future price will be, buy when you can and sell if you're content with the profits and let others profit too...

Burn your btc by sending it to an unspendable address and prove you would hodl forever.

First they ignore you.
Then they laugh at you.
Then they fight you. &lt;- *We're currently here*
Then you win.

\&gt;  say 1 BTC becomes $40000. I mean, a person with 1000 BTC, that is a lot of $.  
Yeah it's a lot of money, but come to think of it there's a couple of thousand billionaires out there with at least 25x that $.

Which you won't because gpu mining isn't even available at that time, it is mostly mined with cpu. Satoshi also asked that gpu mining is postponed to give a chance to everyone. [
And bitcoin wouldn't probably have taken off with you holding the most coins. Since your end goal was still USD at the end.

Never go all in and never go all out is always a good rule of thumb. It is now obvious that bitcoin is not going away anytime soon, it has now existed for a decade and most likely will continue to exist for another decade and more so why sell all? Should've left a minimum of 30% of his holdings if he needs money right now, that 30% can be life changing in the future compared to 140k he'll earn right now which is not that much at all and can be easily gone in a few years.

Well you can go to bitcointalk and donate 50 btc and get VIP status and also add custom title to your name, totally worth it!

Only a max of 4 million Americans can retire with btc, if that's true. Or around 1% of the population by 2050.
