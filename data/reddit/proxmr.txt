Monero is the only coin in which we cannot check other people's balance so it is the only way to stash trillions of dollars without anyone knowing.

No Dash,ZCash...only xmr because they know it is the only true fungible and anonymous non linkable crypto currency

Alts will rally then, alts are hungry for btc from lendbox

If btc hard forks then alts will hit ultra highs. Ethereum &amp; Monero might go to $100+.

Clearly shows BTC is not private cash, Monero is.

Why not simply use a by default private currency like Monero ? You DNM vendors have it on your marketplace aswell. Monero is veryy stable in comparison to BTC aswell.

Monero did not give attention to its GUI because they believed that there privacy features were more important.
Also there multisig has got another developer and it will be out soon.
There devs ain't doing work for the price, they are doing it as an open-source project works. They are not here to pump there coins hence adding features slowly.
Also look how they implement there hard-fork every six months, SMOOTHLY !!

I would switch to XMR because it has not yet gone into a bubble, by buying into eth we might be purchasing a top aswell, instead get into unpumped ot stable coins.

Dash is a company with a huge premine, they can get things done
