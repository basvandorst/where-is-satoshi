time to show some love

I am tired of your sh$t mark. Somebody please throw the fatass in jail and report a disappearance of the keys.

This is what happen when a frustrated PHP nerd thinks it "badass" to rewrite bitcoin...in PHP and abuse shady workarounds to avoid facing the consequences that comes with it.
Dude made it clear he can write php, put on hold large amounts of fiat and BTC, crashed the marked multiple times, accused the protocol to be responsible...
I can't imagine that dude is walking peacefully in Shibuya with hot chocolate in hand while being such a pain in the ass of millions of people.
Sir MagicalTux, my sincere congratulations, you must be the finest douchebag asshole out there!
Just stay away from Bitcoin, go somewhere remote, buy yourself a lifestock of beer and have fun rewriting stuff like crappy bird in PHP you douche.
Thank you for all that money you made me loose I will remember you you piece of shit.

Maybe I am mistaken but the point of this random IRC log shows that Mark is still not capable of handling the "situation" seriously when asking that the third party speaks Japanese when most of the employees are foreigners and that it is not rocket science to get a translator. Mark is a lunatic who never takes responsibility, find excuses for everyone of his mistakes and committed crazy amounts of frauds with our money.
What makes this community look idiotic is that this clown is still free when he should be rotting in jail.
@_date: 2014-03-13 12:00:46
In his declaration he claim under oath that hackers pirated the damn bitcoin protocol. It's actually impressive how a douche who stole so much money on purpose his still around. How come you owe so much money to so many people without consequences?
At least I wanna see this fatass rot in Jail.

He lives in a 200sqm designer top flat in nakameguro with a view on the city. Do you think he has time to get out to explains you how he manages to rape you?
@_date: 2014-03-28 00:41:42
ho rly? you wouldn't blame the bitcoin protocol rewritten in a web language? It's like a porche with an elevator engine...doesn't make any sense.

SLAM! This is awesome!
Time to make a change with your money people!
@_date: 2014-04-02 06:22:42
The deception...
@_date: 2014-03-12 06:37:46
Wow I love this community. Popcorn time on that apple bashing!
@_date: 2014-03-14 05:52:35
I hate him so fucking much
@_date: 2014-02-28 16:02:37
I think he completely lost it when he bowed and apologized because what he said doesn't make any sense or that video audio is seriously messed up (which I doubt because the camera shutter sounds are uninterrupted).
What I hear is:
    moushiwake[murmur]arimashita...nandake? [sight]
which sort of translates to
    sowwy[silent]I am...what is it again? [sight]
Japanese media where really nice correcting his poor performance and put the correct sentence "moushiwakearimasendeshita".
**This moron can't even properly bow and apologize** this is surreal I can't believe this is happening.

Just come to Japan already! I would love to spend all that money spent on amazon buying sheets with bitcoin on overstock. Litecoin would be awesome too...
@_date: 2014-03-06 06:02:30
If any FT people read this: F you!
If every blog of website of the internet forced people to register to read their crap do you think that would be convenient? Stupid morons!
@_date: 2014-04-07 03:03:13
If there so many opportunities then maybe Mark is relevant as a detestable person don't you think?
The people who were working w him(talked to few), his wive who left him, the friends he don't have all hates him. And for the big amount of money that he made me loss voluntary with a big smile, I hate Mark.
Let's not be naive
@_date: 2014-03-08 02:19:22
I am not gonna buy apple shit ever. Devices are ought to be used the way we want, not using us to profit one company.
@_date: 2014-02-28 16:24:26
That ad on top of the game is really annoying. I would be mad this thing would show up at some crucial time/action.
@_date: 2014-02-14 08:25:58
I am looking forward to news like:
"Bitcoin CEO assaulted and hospitalized by angry customers".
I don't think I would be able to stay calm seeing this careless dude walking around with a high calorie coffee while people are loosing money
@_date: 2014-03-05 07:35:24
Poor little cute girl. She sounds so cute!
Marc you such a prick
@_date: 2015-01-13 02:19:55
That analogy is dumb unless you can blow somebody's face with a transaction.
@_date: 2013-11-26 12:35:32
With the 24 hours it takes to withdraw BTC out of mtgox, you better hold and let the coin take value. fuck mgox made me miss 50% rise of LTC
@_date: 2013-08-23 02:11:32
Every month I spend 1 hour of my time and 80 usd transfer fees from Japan to France. Banks are irrelevant and useless.
@_date: 2013-12-09 16:13:51
You can't send a picture via bluetooth why would you be able to send BTC on this cluster shit overrated phone anyway
@_date: 2013-11-27 11:22:05
36 Hours for BTC withdrawal. Still no answer from customer service after 24hours. When you think about it, everything about mtgox sucks. You people don't wanna deal with gox they are full of shit
@_date: 2013-07-25 01:49:25
I am trying to get rid of banks with bitcoin as it is made for that. This "bank" doesn't make any sense
@_date: 2013-12-04 05:12:29
I am 90% in Litecoin 10% in Bitcoin because I don't see a fast food chain make the customer wait 10 minutes for their transfer to arrive. I see BTC as a way to transfer big amounts and LTC for everyday shopping
@_date: 2013-11-13 15:37:41
Look at them. A whole bunch of filthy dudes in suit trying to take our freedom already. Disgusting load of corporate shit
@_date: 2013-11-15 03:54:41
Ho yeah !?
I got my trading account wrong and account has been locked (I wish you could not use it when ou have 2way-auth).
Send email two days ago still no answer.
Managed to get somebody on their shady QQ support who always tell you there is 100 people on the waiting list even even 24 hours later. 
Anyway I sort managed to get somebody on that QQ support thing and the reset my trading password but my account is still locked &gt;&lt;
I just called them and I got somebody on the phone. They told me they will call me back to verify my info.
The person I got on the pone sounds professional and I think I am close to an end but still that's 48 hours me trying to get to them. Why not allow people to reset their trading password with 2way auth or just not using anyway because it makes you loose time when you wanna do that quick trade.
Anyway that's my customer experience so far. 48 hours of time and a lot of money lost.
