Lol. Ethereum's smart contracts are essentially the opposite of "robust". I know. Let's create a platform where developers can write their own code and create a massive honeypot in the process. Have you not been around for Ethereum's history? There is a reason that the opcodes in Bitcoin are limited dude.

It is almost infinitely easier to seize money from your bank account than from your bitcoin wallet.
There are accounts where people have done OTC trades, sold the bitcoin, transferred money to their bank account, only to have it seized because other guy at the end of the deal was doing something illegal.
The fact is. If it's in a bank account, it's not your money. It is the fucking banks. That's why we have crypto.

Risk index: "it could all go to zero"

Might as well throw those two out of the window.
Technology index and Adoption index seem better at least. Hopefully get some people to read those whitepapers.

What is actually happening to the mempool? Something pretty significant must have happened for tx count to drop like this.

No, it's the bank's money at the point. Your funds could be seized and stolen from you. Why are people so oblivious?

Doesn't seem to be a problem. At some point, I need food to survive, and I'll have to use my money (or something) to buy food.


This doesn't seem like a complete question. Regardless, people do exchange things for value even while Bitcoin is rising today, so again a non-issue here.


I agree, and this is what adoption looks like. An "S" curve. Eventually stability will be reached for anything, but it doesn't happen overnight.


There are so many arguments why this is not the case. I'm not going to bother to list them here.


Then call me insane, but I'm making money hand-over-fist when people pay me BTC for my work.


Not yet. Bitcoin is a *far* better solution than we have ever seen, and good enough to replace fiat currency. If you think there is a better solution, go make it happen and report back.

Something I didn't see a lot of people comment about: It doesn't make sense to have a satoshi symbol because we can add decimal places. If you make a symbol to represent the smallest denomination, the number represented will change over time which can lead to extremely confusing scenarios.
@_date: 2019-03-03 18:54:36
It's not. That is just one dude saying it is, and even in the article it mentions that other companies are "finding new ways to innovate". Seems like the guy who is claiming this just doesn't know how to adapt. Moore's Law is still in play in many facets.
This is you just grasping for straws. You probably googled that after getting annoyed with my comment, and posted the first article that agrees with your opinion.
For so many of you surprisingly don't know how bitcoin works. Here we are refuting arguments that people have been trying to make (unsuccessfully) for the last ten years. When will you people learn?
@_date: 2019-03-17 22:18:58

I was in a group where someone wanted us to all download and setup venmo for lunch. I said "No thanks". I shouldn't be forced to use a thirdparty for making monetary transactions especially when they require me to justify my reasoning for making a transaction in the first place!

Don't you think that this is going to happen anyway regardless of the intention? Don't you think contributors, who know the value of their work and what they will receive for compensation, have an edge to trade this token one way or the other because their actions control the issuance rate?

It is because of Moore's Law. Looks like someone didn't read the white paper.

@_date: 2019-03-07 23:09:19
I'm a maximalist too.
I don't really understand it. I don't like the idea because it seems like they are shifting the risk onto the holder of BSQ. Contributor gets paid; holder is left with an IOU that they can either trade or use to pay Bisq fees. The fact that they are not raising capital is irrelevant to me.
So, I could be totally wrong here, but it appears like when you buy a BSQ token you are taking a bet that development (issuance of new BSQ) will be less than the use of BSQ in trading fees (burning). 
Maybe someone could help me understand. As it is written in the link, I don't think I would be motivated to buy BSQ token at all.

@_date: 2018-10-19 02:13:05
I found out from a friend who was really into security. We were roommates. Sadly, he doesn't own any bitcoin.
I didn't buy them at first because there really weren't many options. You could wire money to some random person, but that is risky. So, instead I just mined coins until I could buy them from more reputable sources. 
The reason I did it was because I had access to a whole computer lab at school for mining. So, it was free for me (not for the school), and who doesn't want free money?
Probably some of you are going to read this and get on your moral high horse, and say I was stealing electricity or some shit.

It's true. However, plenty of people in 2013 were in the space before, and went through the same rises/crashes. The same cycle happens over and over, and eventually (hopefully) people just learn to DCA buy and remember that Bitcoin has a limited supply. Innovation is happening. Banks suck.

I don't give a fuck about the "state of this sub" or whether it's "petty". If I see one of these, you can bet your ass I'm going to take it down. It's the same argument for bitcoin.com.

@_date: 2017-11-14 09:02:30
It's not broken. It's working. I don't understand your panicking at all. Science wins in this game man. Go look at the github repository. Bitcoin has 480 contributors all working together to bring bleeding-edge improvements into the technology. These are the dudes who could go launch an ICO and make millions, yet they don't. Instead, they work on Bitcoin because they know it's going to change the world and that matters more to them. 
Scaling *will* happen. But more important than scaling is security and decentralization first.
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:56:32
Wow dude.
I tell my wife everything. We make all the decisions together even crypto ones. She's even helped me make a lot of smart decisions with money that ended up getting us more bitcoin in the end.
We have no plans to divorce, and honestly even if we did. I'd want her to be able to take care of herself (she's welcome to 50% of everything and more if she needed it). 
I hope that you can trust your wife and build a good marriage. That is more important than bitcoin or money, and I'm appalled by a lot of the comments in this thread advising you to do otherwise.
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:29:43
I was just watching some people talk about that on WCN. People who tried to send BTC to BCH addresses and *lost* their coins.
@_date: 2017-11-14 02:43:08
It is unfortunate, but my honest opinion is that it isn't that bad. Especially in the crypto space. We've seen fake exchanges where coins get stolen, people who were margin called on trades they shouldn't have lost, mtgox, btc-e, etc.
For this news, it *is* unfortunate, and yes I would probably panic. But putting it in perspective of all the other events that happen makes it hard to justify legal action for not being able to trade temporarily.

@_date: 2017-11-13 05:27:32
The green is a buy wall and the red is a sell wall. The point at which they meet is close to the current price, and as you go out, shows what someone is willing to buy/sell at. The height shows how much USD (in total for sum of orders) for that given price point.

Right? I've bought at all levels: double digits, through the 2013 rise/fall, and even just a few hours ago.
This is gentlemen people. Bitcoin is going mainstream. CME group? Do you people realize how big this is? Every futures market taken by CME group has gone through the roof, just look at gold.
I'm going to keep buying bitcoin. I'm finally shaking off the shackles of the legacy banking system, and freedom is here.

It's an interesting idea; however, there is a certain point in allowing bcash blocks to be empty. Those empty blocks are representative that no one values that network enough to utilize it for anything meaningful.

If you are not familiar with it, go read about "Dollar Cost Averaging". This is the way I recommend investing in anything. Second, whatever amount of money you decide to place into Bitcoin, you need to make a decision about how much you would be OK with losing and still have peace of mind. 
I will say that historically Bitcoin hasn't caused anyone to lose money as long as they have held up to now. People who "lose money" grow impatient, invested too much, got scared. Perhaps think about how you might react before making such a decision.

It's actually an issue though. Maxwell spoke about this quite a few times. They dif some tests by connecting to multiple pools to determine at what point new blocks are propogated through the network.

That's a correct statement.

If you guys haven't already sold your BCH, then do it now. 
My opinion: Bitcoin Cash had a much better chance to compete with Bitcoin when no one had seen it fail before, when they had 50% of the hashrate, when they didn't have to compete against S2X *and* core, and when the price wasn't weak. I think that this is the exit pump in BCH and the final attempt to contend with real Bitcoin because after the fork, that altcoin is fucked. If you're in BCH, you are playing with fire.
@_date: 2017-11-08 03:49:31
I don't know, but I'm going there in two months. I guess I'll find out :)
@_date: 2017-11-07 04:24:48
Bcash doesn't have anything *actually* going on. So, they need to resort to name calling, deriding core developers, making things harder for Bitcoin to succeed, in order to gain attention and fool some percentage of people. It is a childish tactic to sling mud at someone else in order to draw attention away from your own faults. That's what I think is happening there.
EDIT: You Bcash losers keep downvoting this, but it is fucking true and you all know it.

To be quite honest, most investors (even traditional) don't research enough. The diversification is a manifestation of this because it would require too much effort to study everything.

They aren't against scaling. Instead they know that the scaling problem needs to be solved with a non-linear solution hence segregated witness.

There is a reason. People who are long on Bitcoin are rewarded with S2X coins. You don't get rewarded if you are short.

You make excellent points. It's difficult to know if the exchange knowingly denied them access or if it was an uncontrollable problem.
@_date: 2017-11-14 02:17:21
This is exactly it. I don't hear of anyone planning to sue them. Sure, it may be inconvenient. However, in this case it sure does raise some eyebrows. What *exactly* were these people expecting and *why* are they so worked up over it?
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:01:32
It is not the best. There may be better ways that we haven't thought of yet. It is better than a blocksize increase.

@_date: 2017-11-14 02:11:26


It's not like that. I keep reading on WeChat and QQ that multiple Chinese were in on the pump/dump. That they were told to sell BTC for BCH. If that really is true, then I don't have sympathy for them.
I don't really buy something just to sell it later. I know some people do, but for me, that is not why I buy Bitcoin. (I don't buy other cryptos). 


I'll give you that. They didn't do anything wrong, but like all things, people should be aware of what they are getting themselves into. Should they get special treatment because they got fooled into this whole thing? I don't think they should.
EDIT: One last point, if the exchange refuses to give them their coins, then I think a lawsuit is warranted absolutely. But that is not the case here.
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:09:35

I don't really care if you doubt my net worth.

I agree.
Why is this post even being up-voted?
I'm pretty disgusted with the community recently. Mike Hearn did a lot of great work for Bitcoin early on, and decided by his own convictions to stop contributing. There's nothing wrong with that, and it happens quite often in open source. At the very least, we should be thankful that he did something for Bitcoin! Why the need to vilify him?
@_date: 2017-10-24 07:33:10
It's getting ridiculous isn't it?
"Guess what everyone? You know that thing we talk about here every day? I bought some!" (picture of receipt).
Actually, this one is even more amusing because there isn't even a receipt. It's just a picture of a physical coin.
@_date: 2017-10-18 18:08:07
Honestly, I don't see the point. Bitcoin isn't a company or something that should even need promotion. Would you pay for an advertisement saying "Use the Internet today!"? People are going to flock to bitcoin regardless because the fundamentals are good.

Forks are actually wonderful.
A large number of software projects that are very popular that we use today result from forks. Without forking, what is the point of open source? Please fork Bitcoin (if you think you can improve upon it). Don't stifle development.
@_date: 2017-10-12 18:53:55

Big pockets want in and know they can manipulate. They have a lot of practice doing it. The only way to not lose is to not give a fuck what people like Jamie say. Do your own research and decide if Bitcoin is really a "fraud" or not.

@_date: 2017-10-09 05:14:42
What is the deal with them? They are basically 2.0
@_date: 2017-10-12 19:17:25
That is something out of a nightmare 
@_date: 2017-10-11 14:38:27
I'm so sick of this fucking attitude.
Bitcoin represents economic freedom for people all over the world. That is what the *main* purpose of Bitcoin is! It isn't about making the 1% more rich (and if you live in a 1st world nation that's probably you).
@_date: 2017-10-18 23:07:11
I did not know this. I'll have to look it up.
@_date: 2017-10-30 14:28:05
I generally downvote all memes, but this one..this one will always receive my upvote.
@_date: 2017-10-05 18:28:56
I think spending/selling is perfectly fine. However, if I have a bunch of bad currency (fiat) I'm going to get rid of that first before I use Bitcoin which is more valuable to me. This same situation happens with other currencies i.e. dollars vs bolivars. 
@_date: 2018-04-14 18:45:21
Rip off. I got mine for less than a dollar on eBay.
@_date: 2017-05-11 15:32:21
News articles are still showing those casciasus coins...
@_date: 2017-05-01 08:38:02
Yeah, I don't plan to retire. I hate being bored.
@_date: 2017-05-27 04:16:27
Wow there are some toxic comments here. Good for you OP, I'm looking to do the same thing pretty soon! My wife and I have been saving rigorously for a home, and we are planning to sell our bitcoin so that we can afford a down payment on one. I think it is a wise decision you made, so congratulations!
@_date: 2017-05-23 19:14:10
I don't even have a car. I haven't owned one for years, and sure, I could go buy a few teslas or w/e with my bitcoins with room to spare. But I don't need it, and this isn't what it's about for me. I'm tired of being at the mercy of my government and big banks. They can go fuck themselves.
@_date: 2017-05-29 02:30:52
I paid $80 in transaction fees the other day.
@_date: 2018-12-01 07:04:10


Of course it does. Why the fuck do you think people mine it?


Strawman. We'll just throw point  out the window.


The transactions certainly do not stay constant. Where did you hear that? Also, energy is used in order to secure the network. Comparing it to transaction count is ridiculous.
@_date: 2019-05-01 21:24:26
If you guys even bothered to read, you would know that Eligible Contract Participants are allowed to use Bitfinex services.
In short, if you have $10M+ then you are not barred from the exchange.
Man this sub sometimes..
This is from the BFX FAQ page.


An Eligible Contract Participant includes a corporation that has total assets exceeding $10,000,000 and is incorporated in a jurisdiction outside of the United States or its territories or insular possessions. This will be the principal basis upon which we will continue to do business with selected U.S. persons.
@_date: 2018-12-08 19:23:58
Yeah, this is exactly why they are "doing this no matter what". Isn't it obvious people?
@_date: 2018-12-22 20:52:38
There are absolutely consequences even if they have 100% of the funds.
@_date: 2019-05-02 16:33:11
Yeah, "paaaaleease" go fucking Google instead of spewing your bullshit and conspiracy crap. It took me 30 seconds to get this information.  You are the epitome of misinformation in this sub.
@_date: 2018-12-26 23:44:34


lol have you ever been there? This is straight up JCJ material. 
@_date: 2018-12-22 02:27:41
I'm out of the loop. wtf is happening Jan 3rd?
@_date: 2018-12-22 07:02:01
I totally agree with the idea that you should hold your keys. However, I think that organizing and carrying out a bank run just causes problems. I wish it were not happening.
@_date: 2018-12-08 18:53:34
Why not tell us what lies there are in the video, so that we can discuss them?
@_date: 2018-12-28 15:19:15
I have paper wallets that have lasted more than 5+ years. Also, it should be obvious that you make MORE THAN ONE, and store them in different geographical locations.
@_date: 2018-12-27 01:40:30
You do have a point. Trains being on time is something I take for granted. Also, they announce what the stop is very clearly.
Never had a sexdoll, so can't comment on that though.
@_date: 2018-12-28 15:20:58
Well, if that's your scenario, then so be it. Maybe it isn't very good for that. PAPER has worked for me since before hardware wallets even existed.
@_date: 2019-05-12 03:04:43
I guess Vegeta isn't the only one training..
@_date: 2018-12-28 18:06:22
You can make jokes all day dude, but at least I'm not dealing with issues of my hardware wallet getting hacked. You guys have fun with that mess.
Also, yeah, it fucking is the currency of the future. It's amazing that I can maintain a completely cold, offline, storage medium that works pretty great for long term storage, and I don't have to rely on some manufactured product sold by a company.
@_date: 2018-12-28 03:54:02
I use some pretty rad hardware. It is called PAPER.
@_date: 2017-06-27 04:24:45
pretty much :D
@_date: 2019-05-28 00:45:38
I'm on the bottom left.
@_date: 2018-12-22 16:41:17
I really doubt it would work like that. Exchanges aren't going to buy spot to allow everyone to withdraw.
Exchanges keep a certain percentage in a hot wallet, and when that runs out, they tell users to wait while they "refill" the hot wallet. If they are practicing a fractional reserve, then they just won't refill, or it will take longer than usual. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 21:42:30
Exactly this! Going through the same thing. At this point, I don't even talk to my friends or family any more about bitcoin. Sure, they talk about it around me, but unless they are interested in the tech, I have nothing to say to them.
@_date: 2018-12-23 20:34:26
Why do you guys upvote this? Brian is just promoting a shitcoin. Not Bitcoin related!
@_date: 2017-06-12 22:42:38
This is exactly why i hold bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-05-01 23:37:55
That's not really what is important. It's in the NYAG report. It specifically mentions that they think the customers are ECPs.
Before making a top-level sub post, I would assume OP would do some due diligence before making themselves look ignorant and ask themselves, "Hm, I wonder what an ECP is. I better look that up.".
For even better lulz, how much do you want to bet OP didn't even read the report? Maybe they just went ahead and made this post based on hearsay. Oh and look at that upvote count of all the sheep who just follow.
@_date: 2019-05-16 17:20:48
25k? Why in the world would you? That is like selling around $1500-2000 in the last run.
