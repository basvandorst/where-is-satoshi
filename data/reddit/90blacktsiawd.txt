As someone who runs a successful business... 
If I tell a customer that they can expect their product by a certain date, then my suppliers don't live up to their word and get me the ordered materials to make that product in time for the agreed upon delivery date, that's on me and me alone.  You made the promise to a customer and you need to do your best to live up to that promise.  Sometimes things beyond your control happen.  That doesn't mean you get to pass the blame down the line to your suppliers.  It means you need to do your damnedest to come up with some creative solutions.  This is one of the things that make the difference between an OK company that you may want to do business with again and an amazing one that the customer will absolutely call again the next time they have a need you can fill.
Put on your big boy pants and make it right by returning their money.  How haven't people in this day, especially tech savy folks, not learned that bad press on the internet can blow up in your face overnight destroying your reputation and possibly even your business?  Is $25k the value of your companies public face?
