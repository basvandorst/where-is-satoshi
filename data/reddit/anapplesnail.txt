But you as the customer do not have this information. How do we stop a devious third party exchange from splitting the take with a "profit-centric" vendor prepared to accept some criticism for "allegedly" cheating? (it is alleged unless you have evidence) What would catch this pair at it?


I could embed the name of the merchant in any transaction though. I want to prove a transaction (with details X btc for Y product) is accepted by both parties, to publicly record those involved, and to carry out the transaction. Since it cannot be reversed, the transaction had best be very carefully prepared.

Hello. I don't post much here, but this is a basic logical fallacy.
.1. "Some people downvote because they are shills, so downvotes are shilling."
Consider the inverse:
.2. "Some people upvote because they are shills, so upvotes are shilling."
Who would post 2? Nobody thinking.
This is a basic moderation fallacy:
"Shilling is bad, and downvotes are shilling. Let's hide downvote totals."
.1. and 2 are not logically true, and the premise is false, and the conclusion is ineffective to boot.

Does anyone besides Bitpay know how a BTC account is linked to a dollar bank account? If they are the only ones who know, both parties must trust them.
To, say, not take a cut of the treachery on a small percentage of transactions. "No, you used the wrong account."  Can you use the blockchain to post and confirm that the address you'll use is meant for your purchase?

Hello. I would agree that some votes are manipulated on some posts - and done right, it can hide good posts and float bad ones. Fighting this manipulation probably keeps the mod teams on this subreddit hopping to catch trolls and shitposters. That is a high calling.
But unless you have actually changed the sort order, does hiding the totals change the sorting? Just after this change started we saw some scam posters take advantage of the change. This example is an example both of upvote abuse, and people should have known better. The scammer's manipulated posts shot to the top (Send 1 btc to xx.yy, get 1.5 back!) and stayed on top for several hours. Did hiding the totals change that behavior for the better?
Good luck in your endeavors.

Hello. Thank you for your reply in depth. To consider possible transaction failures, we need to consider failure modes. Imagine that T-mobile will do anything to receive your money and conceal that they got it. This lets them get money for nothing.
For this exercise, we will state that proof, on the blockchain, of the transaction and ownership of the accounts involved, means you win (buy the phone). Failure means you lose (pay money for nothing).
The best I can come up with is to pre-arrange a "handshake" of sorts.
T1: I, Enigmatic, will pay T-mobile 3.7645 bitcoins for an iPhone at account {the account they told me} from {my temporary wallet}  12345
T2: I, sales at T-mobile, will do transaction 12345 with Enigmatic, 3.7645 bitcoins for an iPhone, from {his wallet} to {our wallet}  12345
Now that these are on the blockchain, we can proceed to T3
T3: 3.7645 btc from {Enigma wallet} to {T-mobile wallet}  12345
Now, let's pick at the first crack. How can T-mobile squirm out? They would want to say that T2 came from someone else. How do we prove it came from them?

What is the process with BitCoin if you send T-Mobile $ for a phone and get no phone?
So far, I have seen advice encouraging people to use a temporary account number for every transaction. Can you use the BlockChain to prove these things?
1. Account A sent money to accoun B (yes)
2. You own Account A (probably)
3. T-Mobile owns account B (maybe)
4. You got no phone (possibly)

Hello. I think that power must include both responsibility and authority. I feel that authority (the ability to prove correct statements) is lacking. That could be only because I have limited understanding of how to negotiate bitcoin. How does a person prove that a second party owns a particular address?
Customer: "T-Mobile scammed me. They said to send $400 to account {number}. Here is the transaction proving I did this from my account {wallet}."
T-mobile: "We do not own {account}. The customer must have paid another company, not us."
Unless T-mobile uses a few static accounts (which is discouraged), how will Customer prove that they paid?

Do they "Confirm compliance with state or local licensing requirements, if applicable" as required?

Did they say that they were following all the laws? The federal law says "Be sure to have approval from each territory/state."

But almost the only software licenses that go unpaid are cracked versions and illegal copies. These do not even touch a licensing system and will still be invisible... Except to invasive "copy protection" malware.

Sometimes people tell a lie in a way that lets them avoid saying "No." If I didn't want to run an app on my phone without time to research it, it might be less awkward to pretend to forget my password, rather than say, "No, I don't want to do that because you might be tricking me."
There are people out there who are bad. If you loan them a phone too "call for a ride," they'll sign up for paid crap And get a cut.
All we ever see of others is part of what they do. Their thoughts and motivations must be guessed at. They may have been refusing without saying no.

Hey there, thanks for responding. If we exchange Bolivars for BTC, what is the exchange rate? And what was it in 2010?

Hello. Many disaster efforts that accept material donations get buried under crap. People clear out their attic, sending old clothes and other things that aren't helpful. At best these only consume transportation and human resources to sort. At worst they also prevent site organization. Money can be turned into exactly what they need. Mom's old polyester sweaters are worth nothing in Thailand.

The three main groups to suspect are:
Your DHCP provider (probably Google or your ISP. Turns thing.com into an IP address)
The web site owner or a hacker acting as them
A government, authority, or site host.
