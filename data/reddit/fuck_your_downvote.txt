So... no proof, just more speculation and rumors?

Before walking into the strip club, you switch your phone over to your fully anonymous wallet and remind your friends to do the same.  At the door, the bouncer points to a QR code on the wall.  You aim your phone at it and agree to the cover charge.  It's the reason you chose this place -- they accept bitcoin.  The bouncer's pocket beeps, acknowledging a new, but unconfirmed transaction.  He'll be sure to find you if it doesn't confirm soon.
  
You find some empty seats at the stage.  A waitress asks what you'd like to drink and taps the corresponding button on her phone's screen.  The bartender will have the order ready to go by the time she gets to the bar.  That's the other reason you came here, you heard that the service is incredibly fast. 
The waitress is already back with your drinks.  In front of you, she places a napkin with a QR code on it.  You point your phone at it and accept the payment and suggested tip.  The waitress's phone vibrates, and she sets your drink down with a smile.  Your friends raise their glasses as a member of your party makes a toast to the bachelor.  Another chimes in to congratulate you on your choice of venue.
A dancer makes her way over to your group.  She thrusts a hip at you so you can scan her QR code temporary tattoo.  A moment later, the string of lights that ring the stage blinks softly in acknowledgement.  The dancer shakes her ass.
When she's done, you scan her code again and point to the bachelor, telling her that he's getting married.  She informs you that they have some specials for bachelor parties and gestures to the waitress to bring over the appropriate menu.  She shakes her ass for the bachelor.
The waitress arrives with a laminated menu and takes your order for another round of drinks.  You glance over the specials.  Lap dances.  Private rooms.  What's this?  Make It Rain?  Curious, you scan the code next to it.  The lights blink, a siren wails, and *POOMFFF*, an air cannon launches monopoly money and glitter over the stage.  You chuckle.
While still expertly displaying her crotch for the bachelor, the dancer gracefully leans over and lets you know that she built the Make It Rain device as a project for her microcontrollers class.  She's just dancing to pay for college.

Glad I could help.
When you do achieve 501c3, be sure to post it.  It's likely to attract more donations.
I really love what you're doing.  For the past few years I've dreamt of doing something very similar.  For now, I'll live vicariously through your posts. 
Good luck, and keep up the good work!

I've heard rumors that the new EBCDIC miners will be using punchcards, is this correct?

If you haven't already achieved 501c(3) status, but you hope to, I'd keep the word "betting" out of any sentence containing the word "donations".  I'd suggest rephrasing it as "investing."
While there is potential for huge growth, I'd suggest the most responsible thing to do is A.  Once donations exceed the expected mortgage payments for the current fiscal year, then you can pay down principle.  At the end of the year, the priority reverts back to A, then B once A is covered, and the cycle repeats.
What is the current legal status of this project?   If you haven't already consulted with a lawyer, I'm sure one would be willing to spare a few hours for a good cause.
Also, I think what you're doing is awesome.

Load 1 bitcoin onto a paper wallet.
Wait until spring.
Bury it in your garden.

Security is never complete.  It's a constant battle.  At the rate things change in the information age, those crazy olden days will always be just a few days behind us.

* Gets the facts wrong.
* Draws faulty conclusions from this incorrect information.
I used to like Cringely, but he really phoned this one in.  This is damaging to both bitcoin's reputation and his own.

You must be from a different timeline than I am.
In my 2015, original pet rocks and chia pets have gained significantly in value as hipster cults have come to view them as sacred objects.  Personally, I'm here to scour yard sales for garbage pail kid trading cards as they are trading above gold in my 2015.  I may even stick around until the October Bitcoin Crash and pick up a few at $80 as they're hovering at $570 in my 2015.
I have to say, I've very much enjoyed 2013... again.  I had almost forgotten what it was like living in a world in which antibiotics were still effective.

If you don't want your dust, just create a zero spend transaction with the dust as the transaction fee.  Whatever miner processes that block will get it.
That said.  Dust can add up over time until it's spendable.   The value could also someday rise to the point where that dust is spendable.

Nice work.  I'd love to see a full writeup on the vulnerability once it has been confirmed fixed and you're given the OK.
Was this you?  This is the most recent one in my logs:
09/12 0948EDT:128.20 to 117.10 and back to 128.81
If occurs a few time a day, going back to at least Monday(my oldest full log).
Your efforts had the unintended benefit of forcing me to make my own code more robust in an attempt to detect and manage this.  Happily, I can now differentiate between this type of price manipulation and and a genuine flash-crash.
Many thanks for that and making the service more secure.

Can someone point me to these bitcoins or the wallets they are in?
I keep hearing rumors about them, but I've never seen them for myself.
