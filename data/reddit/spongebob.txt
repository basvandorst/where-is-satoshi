Don't have any coins on MtGox - stopped trusting them a couple years ago when they were the only ones having DDoS attacks and trading engine lags.  But the idea sounds cool.

Really?  Who would put that much cash in the pockets of a stranger.  Yes, cash.  
I know, "Everyone else was doing it..."

Best it goes bye-bye.  I am not downvoting, but still it needs to die because all of what you are saying happened 4 times before and I am tired of the 'bad press' every (surprise) 6 or 8 months along with a 300.00 drop.

Can't be regulated short of a global power failure.  In her own words - Yellen:

Not sure.  But the math says Mark Karpeles made ฿4553 in commissions today (volume ฿91079 x .05%) because people are hitting buy and sell on his exchange all day.  So, he may be fearing for his life or whatever, but the longer this goes on, the richer he gets.
He can get $2,618,538 for those coins on bitstamp right now. (and he is the only one who CAN withdraw from MtGox right now)  Criminal.

I would love to see them try regulating bitcoin.  It just doesn't work that way.  There is no way to tell someone, "you can't have bitcoins" or keep them from using them. 
I guess they could do a global power outage.  That would kill it - until the power comes on again.

Well, it was one of the 5 times spoken of here thebitcoinchannel.com/archives/33727
They had a severe trading lag causing trades to execute 5, 10, or 15 minutes later.  That means that you see the price fall from 250 to 230, so you click sell...
You then you watch the price continue to drop and your order is not being executed, 210, 190, 170, 130, 110 &amp; bam it executes.  No way to cancel the order and no way to tell how long the lag will be before clicking "sell".
Then mtgox jusst shuts down trading for 2 weeks and says they need to fix the trading engine.
