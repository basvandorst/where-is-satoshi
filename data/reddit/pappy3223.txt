I wouldn't pay the IRS with Bitcoin ever.  Bitcoins are finite.  They can afford to amass as much as people give them, and than have enough Bitcoin to affect the supply/demand.  Bad move imo.

I'm getting really tired of people thinking Bitcoin has a CEO.

Your 5th amendment gives you the right to remain silence if what you have to say will convict you.  General Terms, correct me if I'm wrong.  They can hold you in contempt though if you do not give them the password for as long as they want I believe.  
And I find this article somewhat false &amp; true.  If you use a VPN/VPS, they can only monitor what comes out of that tunnel, but the entire tunnel from the demark to your PC is encrypted so they can only bait you into telling them what traffic as going across the VPN.  And there's no way in court to prove you were the one on the PC at the time that the "traffic" is being transmitted.  A great way to increase doudt in court is to have a open remote control for your PC that some "friends" have access too.  These friends can be real or fake, but it would provide your defense without evidence to discredit your actual involvement in any wrong-doing.  And I find the PR campaign from the FED interesting.  
*I believe it's every person's duty that involves themselves in Bitcoin and would like to see it grow even more, to tell the truth about bitcoin.  Tell all the positive and negative sides of it, and let the people decide before someone with a "jaded" intention will come along and leverage the right "person/people" to discredit bitcoin permanently.   All they would need as of right now, would be to trace a transaction that would lead to someone funding terrorism and the public would riot at the very site of BitCoin.  Take care my friends...the more popular we are, the easier it is to de-rail the project.

That logic would be acceptable if you think your any/all private key's haven't already been compromised.  There's a ton of ways to achieve this goal.  If I was leading this "war" against TOR networks, I'd probably start off monitoring the traffic between where you download the TOR download at and it's intended target.  At that point, there's no TOR network to worry about, nor is that connection to where you downloaded TOR client encrypted.  Now I have the user's IP.  From there , do what the NSA is good at.  Research you, log you.  Monitor what programs you use.  Upload malware into your system since all anti-virus developer's have to give NSA backdoors.  From there I'm sure you know the rest.  
I can creatively think of 4 other ways to achieve what they desire.  
Now this can be combated.  First couple layers would be making a standard VDI you would spin up every time you wanted to access the internet.  
Spin up, spoof mac in that VDI from the millions of avalaible MAC address's.  Make sure the TOR client is installed into your .vdi. 
Second layer of protection is, you need to monitor first ISP hop for constant connections.  a NSA connection will be back doored, and hopefully not on a private VLAN so you can monitor long connection periods.  Wireshark will be decent for this with some filtering commands, but keep in mind, that means you are also online during that time.  
You COULD rent a server close by, and run that program from that server, VPN into that server for data analysis and close connection after you are done.  Changing proxy's everytime.  
My personal option is, the cipher is still good...but you are compromised on your desktop, and near field hop's.  
I'd love to see a TOR wireless network go up across the US.  Maybe satellite powered.  Maybe 1000's of people work together and by Cisco Aironet 1242's to support a cause....you never know.  
I'm done.

If they really wanted to crack TOR, they would watermark traffic that's in-route to TOR known IP address's at the user's first node.  Not that hard.  I should work for the NSA. Or TOR. Whoever pay's more.  lol
