For some perspective, I used Ethereum to send ~$4k yesterday and it cost $0.53 and settled in less than 1 minute. Not trying to start a crypto war, just saying, BTC has work to do.

Unmmm, I thought this thread was about avoiding Coinbase because of their support for BCash, Roger Ver and his BS hostile takeover attempts? If so, why are you recommending GDAX?
FWIW, Gemini has a HUGE stake in BTC. I’m actually (but pleasantly) surprised they also support ETH.
I use and recommend Gemini as a fiat gateway, and Binance for alts.

I absolutely do. ETH and BTC comprise 95% of my portfolio.

I GUARANTEE Trump and his cronies are scooping up cheep crypto after his tweet. He’ll probably tweet in a few days how awesome crypto is, then cash out.

He commented to create an cheap entry for himself.

I’m sorry you had problems. I can run an ETH node without issue on a variety of equipment. The key is to use an SSD.
Regardless, I still see ETH as leading the way currently for smart contracts. Yes there’s a number of other players, but the vast majority of the development is still on Ethereum. I know this is a Bitcoin sub, but the question was asked, and I answered honestly. I still love BTC too!

Well, I don’t trust that they have access to my bank account, so…

Jesus. Keep it classy, r/bitcoin.

Ummm, because CNBC predicted it’d go up?

Obviously, folks are selling their BTC for Tesla’s, not Lambos!

Ha ha! Good one.

Yea, I too wish they stuck with the [21.co]( model. Sadly, they went to full-on spam mode with earn.com, then got purchased by Coinbase. Maybe Coinbase will utilize the [21.co]( tech? Who knows.

No, but he still shows BTC as “Legacy” and grayed out in the slider next to the menu. Ver is going to push the limits of decency until people get tired of suing him.

Someone sold on low volume, and someone bought on low volume.

Fantastic tool, many thanks for open sourcing it, I will like drop in a few PRs before long :)
@_date: 2019-06-30 21:16:52
This is how it starts. It’ll actually be easier for a small company to accept crypto than a large one. I never said you had to “blame” them, but that is where you should start to make the change you are seeking.
@_date: 2019-06-30 20:50:47
You should be shouting at the company that you seem to have so much faith in. Why are they forcing you to use the antiquated banking system? Tell then you want to use crypto.
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:55:23
To many phones.  Interesting to see what happens from here!
@_date: 2018-07-23 18:02:29
Agreed, but it worked. It got at least one Redditor to open their mind and here we all are discussing it.
@_date: 2018-04-24 22:31:24
On the slider directly to the left of this menu, they also refer to BCH as “Cash” in gold coloring and BTC as “Legacy” in gray. They are well over that “fine line”.

Iran announced today that they will switch from USD to EUR for their reporting currency. This could mark the beginning of the end of the USD’s position as the global exchange currency.
Crypto is not the only market to see big movement today, also gold and other traditional hedging instruments.
Correlation is not causation, but if I was ultra rich, and wanted to stay that way, I’d buy a shit-ton of BTC when it was relatively low too, seeing what’s going on in the bigger picture here.

:) I do think it is fraud, just perhaps not through a legal definition or any enforceable jurisdiction. Bad behavior was handled by communities long before we created systems of law enforcement and public shaming is the first step.
I think what pisses me off the most is that the crypto-community is constantly being built by amazing people with amazing talents. There are many, but “Nakamoto” and Buterin are shining examples. They bring me hope.
In contrast, I am disgusted by the opportunists flocking in to capitalize on this largely yet unregulated system of money knowing full well that they are defrauding innocent people along the way. Ver is a fine example of this. There are many others but Ver is quickly becoming the poster child of bad actors in crypto. **And he knows this but doesn’t even give shit.**
@_date: 2018-04-24 16:34:00
No one “expects everyone to be a good actor”. The community has simply identified a bad actor and is calling them out on their shit is all. Bitcoin isn’t broken. Ver is.

Please stop calling it Bitcoin Core. Thank you.

I've never had any issue with Coinbase and will continue to use them, personally. BUT, this guidance is clear as mud to me.
AFAIK, a UAHF would only occur, potentially, if, after the SegWit activates (which it should, now that we have &gt;80% signaling for it), we see less than 100% adoption by November 1st of the 2MB limit aspect of SegWit2x (BIP91).
Since ViaBTC has announced that they intend to run with "Bitcoin Cash"––a hard fork from BTC––I see Coinbase's announcement as to say, "go for it, ViaBTC, but we won't support it".
Unfortunately, the language used in Coinbase's announcement makes it hard to be certain that this was their intent. Also, anyone know why Coindesk ran an update sharing Coinbase's announcement, only to pull it down moments later? Perhaps they too, are struggling with the meaning/intent behind the announcement?
Am I reading this announcement correctly? Anyone feeling confident in its meaning?

Thanks for this. This seems sensible. Perhaps we can work this out before-hand. Part of the issue is that the point of the escrow is that if the contractor fails to deliver, the funder would like to get their BTC back. If we liquidate all or some of it into USD as it enters the escrow, then the funder is accepting additional risk. However, if we can all agree that, say, 50% of the crypto-currency would be converted into fiat on entry to the escrow, and all partial fund distributions use an equal amount of both the fiat and the BTC on payment (in proportion to their value on the entry-date), then at least the FX Risk is shared equally to both parties. If the BTC rises in value vs. fiat, I can't see anyone complaining really, but if it tanks, then no one will be happy. C'est la vie! =)

Thanks for this. I've been checking out tether.io, this appears to be just what the doctor ordered for managing this sort of Foreign Exchange Risk to business. Unfortunately, they appear to be in the throes of regulation issues resulting in the inability to use the service right now. I sure hope they get past them! In the short term, I think I'd just be exchanging FX Risk with Counter Party Risk, but this looks like it could be a longer-term solution if they can get past this! Thanks again.
