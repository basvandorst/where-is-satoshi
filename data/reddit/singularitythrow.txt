It's crazy to think that a person who invested at 10k USD price point (which was quite recently) already has 27.5% return.

I have half the btc you have, and I'm double as far as refreshing is concerned.

All the best dude. I can understand how depressing that is. If by any chance, you guys fail ( I hope you don't) , do consider adoption. It's a wonderful gesture and means a lot to someone who is without parents. I'm adopted. I was adopted by a couple who were quite depressed they couldn't have a baby. My Dad says how my Mom used to cry in restaurants and public places all the time when she saw a couple with a Baby. I wish you all the best brother. I'd never want someone to see those days.

It's a shame you didn't share your wallet address along with that analysis. should have fetched you a fortune because of the donations.

I am from India so my suggestions might be of no use to you. I switched from CoinSecure to Koinex. Both are quite popular in India but the latter is fast as far as Deposit and Withdrawals are concerned.

It's like BTC went on a drinking spree at the weekend and is back to the work on Monday.

Thanks, How do I transfer it to my normal BTC account ? Or is it a joke ? Sorry I am new.
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:57:41
Yes it's possible and is done by many. I transferred my BTC from one exchange to another due to this and gained a little. :) Gained 50$ due to this. (My investment is only around 300$ so yeah it matters.)
@_date: 2017-11-04 07:51:23
Yeah, wait till it reaches 10k USD. That'll be a good time to buy.

Please don't be another tease. Please.
