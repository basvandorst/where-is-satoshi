Jesus. There aren’t sides in crypto. It’s not football. All of these techs have value. Bitcoin’s value is that it was a first mover and has amazing adoption and now stability. Nano’s is that it’s a next generation tech with low power requirements but limited adoption. If we can’t talk about parallel technologies without taking sides, this market will never mature out of its infancy.

Who the fuck is shilling for Nano? I’m a significant BTC investor. Is Nano Voldemort? Can it not be mentioned? This is a question about energy consumption and Nano is a tech that has addressed this. Not talking about their tech is about as foolish as religious fruitcakes pretending that science doesn’t exist.

How about you answer the question I asked? “How does Bitcoin compete with that in the long term?”

Incompetence + Lots of missing BTC + Police investigation + Arguing + Broken English = Francesco Firano. And if that's the case, it's not your BTC to begin with.

Franceso Firano from Bitgrail, is this you? You're quite possibly the only moron on earth willing to argue with every single point on a reddit sub while bragging about your BTC...that has been taken from you...AGAIN. With any luck this is the police investigation that Binance is appropriately cooperating with prior to throwing your ridiculous ass in jail.

We now live in a service based society not the agrarian one that defined the 1929 financial marketplace. It’s why service companies such as Twitter and Facebook have substantially higher value than Archer Daniels Midland, one of the world’s largest food companies. An ironic proof of this was Zynga games, makers of FarmVille, actually tried to have an IPO higher than ADM’s marketcap. Anyway, we now live in a service world in which each of these high value services run on databases. Decentralized data and currency will replace our current hub and spoke economy and data infrastructure allowing us to shift to an entirely point to point world. This will change the service economy as dramatically as the shift from an agrarian to manufacturing economy, or manufacturing to service economy. 
Crypto DOES represent real value. Real value in services. The world has changed, and new currency and exchange has been invented to define a new economy. Just as we no longer pay for bulk silk with bags of doubloons, we will no longer pay for services with visa and wire transfers.

Big players entering the market will change the status quo and shake up predictions like these. A lot of large investors are playing chicken looking for a bottom, but they all know the first one in will start a huge run. That’s why you see it trading sideways with these big bumps that last a day or so. As soon as one of these bumps stick it’s gonna fly. I’m guessing the bull run will start in May.

Yup. I noticed this as well. Not sure what shows are on NBC these days, but when it starts getting mentioned there frequently we’re off to the races.

Well dammit. That was my next argument.

Yeah, you’re probably right. The stock market never came back after that crash in 1929. Why would crypto be any different?
