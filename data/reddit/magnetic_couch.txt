BCH is being pumped again this weekend, so BTC will probably dip again this weekend until the dump happens for BCH.

Earlier this morning the group Bitcoinclassic announced they'd no longer be developing contributions to the Bitcoin codebase, and instead are focusing their efforts on BitcoinCash. Part of their announcement was saying that Bitcoin is going to die and Bitcoin Cash is going to be the standard in the future.
So pretty much everybody is selling off all their other cryptocurrency investments so they can jump on the skyrocketing price of Bitcoin Cash before it peaks.
One of the reasons Bitcoin is dropping so quickly is that only a month ago, it was trading at around USD4800. So there's a good chunk of the market that selling at the dropping price today is still a profit for them. This makes it an easy decision to move their assets over to Bitcoin Cash and ride it's sharp gains for a short.

It just about has in a few volatile countries where the government currency is virtually worthless, like Zimbabwe (especially with the current possible coup).

This is just short-term volatility for people dumping their investments to fund jumping into BitcoinCash. Sell off BTC at a 10-15% loss, put all that into BCH and as long as it gains enough that's a net profit.
The movement so far today is about BTC -8.5% and BCH +45%, so anybody that jumped onboard early is going to make out well.

Personally, I'm not jumping at all, I'm picking up BTC during it's dips today. This was just an explanation of *why* things are moving how they are today.
