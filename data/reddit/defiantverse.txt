Not to detract from your advice here, but to add my own thoughts as well:
I don't see any point in discussing crypto with people are not interested in it.  People who are interested in it only to argue have some deeper motivation to justify it to themselves rather than someone else, otherwise they'd be entirely disinterested.  Or maybe they're just recreational contrarians.   A lot of those around these days. Hard to say.
The only conversations really worth having are the ones with people who genuinely want to learn about crypto.  Crypto doesn't need evangelists.  It needs educators.  Two different things which are sometimes confused.

I've been very suspicious of this lately for the same reasons you describe.  My investment horizon for BTC is about 20 years, so  I'm riding this wave out win or lose.  Nobody is getting my BTC until well after the institutions have shown their hand, whether BTC is worth $1 or $1MM by then.

That comparison is useful if you actually understand that there's a major difference between 10^(77) and 10^(80).  I don't know if the 10^(80) figure is correct, but let's assume it is.  That doesn't mean that the number of wallets is close in comparison to the number of atoms in the universe.  It actually means the number of wallet addresses is about 0.001% of the atoms in the (visible) universe.  Yes, that's still a lot, but it's not as much as the comparison can make it sound if you're not good at conceptualizing exponents.

The market has little to do with "Average Joe" adopting bitcoin.  "Average Joe" is waiting on the technology to advance to the point where buying, storing, and spending bitcoin is as easy and secure as using cash or credit cards.  Navigating bitcoin as a newbie right now is incredibly complex and scary.  I just had to shoot an e-mail off to Coinbase recently because the math behind how they calculate their balances is cryptic as hell and it took me about an hour to figure out what was going on after I had already requested assistance.  Volatility in the price has little do with it.  It has *something* to do with it, but it's not the major barrier to entry right now.
@_date: 2018-10-14 18:58:50

Lightning network is great.  And I genuinely mean that.  BUT...
Usage is going to increase when we figure out solutions that make it more secure and people aren't afraid to put real amounts of money into it.  You or I might not feel this way, but I'd say that about 90% of people that begin learning a little about bitcoin have the fear of God instilled in them about either being hacked or doing something stupid and losing their money.
If we ever hope for people to transition into using bitcoin as their preferred currency, then they can't be losing sleep over their security.
You know that people are going to do dumb shit like putting a couple grand on a paper wallet and trying to spend a few satoshis from it and losing the rest to a change address, and that story is going to be plastered all over Facebook.  Cue the FUD.  And honestly, it wouldn't be overstating a very real problem that happens when a genius idea like bitcoin collides with human stupidity.
@_date: 2018-10-12 16:40:56
Not an economist, but I'll risk sharing my ignorance and take a stab at it.  Fiat currency can't be worth whatever the hell governments want it to be as long as gold exists as a (practically) finite reference point for valuation.   Governments would love to be able just print cash and tell people that the old cash is still worth the same amount even though they just doubled the supply.

Huge price spikes are not the only indicators of bull markets.  Several years of smaller, but consistent annual growth is a bull market too.  It may not be as exciting, but these bubbles aren't benefiting anyone except for those lucky enough to time the top and those manipulating the price in the first place.
@_date: 2018-10-25 22:41:19
Since Bitcoin adopters skew young, I chalk a lot of this hyper market-watching up to the age of users and to the possibility that Bitcoin represents the first real investment that a lot of these people are making outside of a managed fund like (a lot of) 401k's.  I remember when I first started investing a long time ago, I watched those stocks like a hawk multiple times a day for weeks before I finally got bored.  Now I don't even check the price of my investments until the next time I make a contribution.

I love hearing non-wealthy people talk about what they think wealthy people do with their money.  Clearly this is why these people are not wealthy themselves.  Wealthy people don't need bitcoin at all.  They own assets and businesses that rain down cash upon them.  They're not gambling on bitcoin and they're too  diversified to sweat over stock returns.  When the next recession occurs, they'll just weather the storm with their minimal savings while their assets and businesses (where they keep most of their wealth) continue to spray cash like a fire hose.
You know who chases market returns?  A small sliver of middle class people whose retirement date is dependent on the stock market, who think they're smart enough to outperform the other 99% of their middle class peers who wouldn't even know where to begin when it came to managing their own investments.  Maybe they are, but there's certainly not enough of them to moon bitcoin.
The wealthy cavalry isn't coming.  The truly wealthy people in the bitcoin space are not the ones investing in the value of bitcoin.  They're the ones who will develop products and services around it and grow their wealth through the consumption of others whether that consumption occurs through fiat or crypto.  They don't care one way or the other because they're rich either way.
@_date: 2018-11-14 15:45:23


Yes, good.  Now let's take it all the way home and paint the bigger picture.  As you say, a true decentralized currency is a non-starter for a government.  What they're really talking about here is digital money.  We already have digital money, so why is this such a big deal?  It's a big deal because it's an opportunity to use crypto as a stalking horse to eliminate cash, which is a government's wet dream.  No more anonymous transactions of value, ever.  Everything systematically tracked, accounted for, taxed, and scrutinized.

I don't think that this is a catalyst event driven market.  It's a market that will be driven by the constant, steady drumbeat of technological advancement in the cryptocurrency space.  This alone is enough to invest in it and why I believe people should be making regular purchases of BTC regardless of the short term pumps and dumps.  I lived through the development of modern computing and the internet, watching it go from a niche hobby to a multi-trillion dollar industry.  Bitcoin is the new internet and the runway for advancement is so long it vanishes to a pinpoint on the horizon.
Don't worry about catalyst events.  Any catalyst events that we talk about here will be nothing but memories years from now and irrelevant to the bitcoin price in the future.  If you believe in the potential of crypto then buy into it in small, steady amounts based upon what you can afford to lose if it all goes south.

This one-size-fits-all investing advice is pointless at best and dangerous at worst.  You can't possibly advise people properly without knowing their goals or risk tolerance.

@_date: 2018-11-25 23:38:14
Maybe what he's saying is that this is not a truism in investing.  Stocks trade on news and earnings and no stock follows this pattern for this reason.  Commodities also trade differently because of world events, resources shortages, labor strikes, politics, etc.  Bitcoin may be unique in this respect that it's market forces are cryptic, much like the currency itself (see what I did there?) and heavily manipulated in ways not seen in regulated markets.  So, in other words, to call this image a "Wall St. Cheat Sheet" is extremely too broad of a brush, because virtually no markets that Wall St. deals with actually act like this.

It's not a business at all.
@_date: 2018-11-20 02:01:43
No, I don't think this is BCH related.  Something else is happening, I'm not sure what.  It may be a confluence of factors.  I have a feeling that a portion of it are individuals locking in losses to offset their gains for 2018 taxes.
Another factor is likely a buildup of fear of further losses in the market.  Hodlers have been on the edge and some are starting to be pushed over.  Once that happens, it tends to accelerate as selling drives lower prices and lower prices push even more people to the edge.
You'll know we've bottomed when the panic sets in.  I think we're close to panic, but not there yet.  All that it's going to take is for someone to shout "fire" in a crowded room and there will be a stampede for the exit.
I don't think people have realized yet quite how damaging CSW's comment about the "bug"  in Segwit that is going to bring the price down to $0 in 2019 actually was.  It was largely ignored, but I think it's scaring a lot of people.

Bitcoin developers are working on projects right now that are more foundational than scaling.  People mistakenly think that because something isn't being worked on right at this moment that it's not ever going to be worked on.  They have a roadmap. Are they good at stick to the timeline?

@_date: 2018-11-12 23:34:31
If they immediately think of "risk", then their idea of bitcoin is an investment vehicle, and that's fine.  A very small percentage of the population has the courage to actively invest.  This is completely normal and not a crypto-specific behavior.  Most people would prefer to just put money away from each paycheck into a pension or retirement fund managed by someone else.
Bitcoin adoption will occur as more people see it as a viable currency and not as an investment vehicle.  I'm stating the obvious and in no way think this insightful, as it's been said on this sub one hundred times over already.  If our expectation is that 5%+ of the world population decides to adopt it as an investment on its own outside of a managed fund, it's **never** going to happen.
What might need to be said on this sub, however, is that price stability is not the main obstacle to bitcoin adoption as currency.  The bar for entry into bitcoin for the average layman is way too difficult right now.  Wallet and payment technology needs to mature.  It has to be as easy as using fiat and accepted as a payment option everywhere Visa and Mastercard are.

Everyone is so focused on the price volatility that they can't see past their own noses and realize that not everyone is equipped with the knowledge, savvy, and courage to take into their own hands the kind of responsibility that securely owning bitcoin entails.

Are you not able to actually use an accepted payment method, or are you using an accepted payment method, but your bank or card issuer is blocking the transaction?  If it's the latter, this often happens because of automatic fraud detection.  You can call a bank or card issuer and try asking them to open up a window where your transaction will clear.  And in that moment, you'll understand the need for BTC even more than you do now.

Consider that Bitcoin is only one implementation of a protocol and public ledger that can be abandoned by its user base and recreated from scratch.  If the goal of bitcoin is to wipe the slate clean and cut out banks from peer-to-peer currency exchange, then there is nothing that stops Bitcoin2 from being born tomorrow with the same rules, but a brand new ledger.  Banks may delay the rise of bitcoin, but over time it's going to become extremely expensive to buy enough crypto to manipulate markets that can pull up stakes and move over on a whim.  That's the beauty of it.  If you don't like what's happening to a specific currency, don't use it.  Use whatever protocol and iteration you like and ask others to join you.

We're headed for some very interesting waters if bitcoin adoption becomes mainstream sooner than the world is ready for it.  A major corporation(s) losing billions or even trillions of dollars due to a hack of their custodial wallets is going to unleash hellfire from government agencies who know just enough about bitcoin to be dangerous, but not enough to be smart, and greedy enough to accept the lobbying dollars of companies that want to see bitcoin dead.  Bitcoin is regulation resistant by design, but its users are not.

BTC is going slow in order to go fast.  It's widely acknowledged that blocksize increases alone can't scale globally.

Blockchains were first described in the early 1990's.

If access to the private key is lost, the coins are lost. 
(The following is theoretical)
However, due to the nature of bitcoin as having a fixed supply, it doesn't matter how many coins are lost.  The remaining coins will absorb the value of coins that are permanently lost, assuming that the market can determine that they are, in fact, lost.  Even if all but a single bitcoin out of the original 21 million are lost, it would be possible to implement sub-satoshi division of a single bitcoin and restore the original supply.
@_date: 2018-11-04 20:52:53
The bitcoin supply is a maximum of 21 million. Period.  End of story.  All that these companies like MC can do is build a house of cards on top of it to capture the ignorant masses.  When it collapses, bitcoin will be blamed at first, of course, but the blockchain will remain, and those who own actual bitcoin (not IOU's), will still have their bitcoin at the end of the day.
Will financial institutions try to perpetrate a foolish endeavor like fractional reserve bitcoin in order to profit?  Probably.  But it will also be a nail in their coffin.  People (in general) don't understand bitcoin and how it differs from the financial system that exists today.  A cataclysmic collapse of a scheme like this will force crypto literacy upon them the hard way.

Conceptually, it runs data through a process and some of the data is lost making it irreversible.  Let's say we had a number 367.  The process is to multiply the first two numbers and drop everything else.  So the hash of 367 is 18 but the original number could have been 367, 361848, 63, 92587.  There's no way to know except trying all possibilities (aka brute forcing).  Obviously SHA256 is more complex, but that's what it meant by "one way functions".

Well, here's the paradox for you then.  If bitcoin gains widespread adoption, there's no way it can hold it's current price as the market cap skyrockets, but without stabilization it won't become adopted in the first place.
So, here's how I think it plays out.  I think it goes through waves of stability and appreciation, each wave bringing in more and more people.  If that occurs, then be prepared for long periods of stability followed by sudden sharp growth followed by more long periods of stability.

Coinbase is going to put a few dollars of fees on top of the purchase.  I think it's scaled depending on the amount you buy, so at .013 I think you're paying $2.99 in Coinbase fees and then probably somewhere between 20-30 satoshis per byte to transfer off of Coinbase.  Wherever I buy Bitcoin I like to throw in a couple extra bucks (just $1-2) to cover me for any future transfers, and honestly those couple of dollars are overkill anyway.

I get that you're never touching the coins or tokens.  That's good.


Yes, but the way this is done means everything.


You can call it whatever you want, but it's skimming whether it happens during the transaction or billed afterwards if the cost is based on a % of transaction value.   I get that you want to make money on developing the software, but the billing model is skimming and your profit is scaled to transaction value, rather than a flat dollar rate for the software or a subscription.

The recovery phrase can be used on HD software and hardware wallets, which is probably most of the popular ones at this point.  In that sense, you're not dependent on any third party for access to your coins since it's entirely portable to any wallet that supports BIP-32.

If protecting yourself against hyperinflation is your primary or sole reason for adopting it, then adopting it before any of these warning signs is not prescience; it's paranoia.

I think this is the wrong way to look at it.  The purpose of a free, open, distributed currency is that individuals get to choose the qualities that their money possesses.  It's not an attack against bitcoin, it's a feature of bitcoin.  
Or you can look at it as an attack, or some sort of price to pay for a decentralized currency.  I suppose there's nothing wrong with this as long as we're just acknowledging the realities of the system.  The danger, however, is that someone actively tries to censor these alt-coins that forked off of the Bitcoin blockchain.  If someone tries to do that... well then they're not just attacking the alt-coins.  They're attacking Bitcoin itself.

Scaling via blocksize is unsustainable.  Block size increases are band-aids that will someday require more band-aids until it's impossible to bandage it any further.  The amount of effort going into scaling via other solutions, even if they're second layer is what is going to propel BTC into position for world-wide adoption.  Smaller blocks right now would be a bad idea, but I hope one day we do get for the simple reason that the current block size will be unnecessary.  I'm hopeful.

The meaning of words are socially decided upon, not individually.  And to say that the pain of hurtful words is self-inflicted is idiotic.

Am I wrong?  You don't skim fees?

Question for the purposes of clarification:  Do you have access to the actual private key?
If you have the actual private key in your possession, you didn't set it up as a multi-sig wallet, and you can continue to access the key even if the wallet developers go belly up, then you should not have any problems accessing your balance.

He never said he was going to carry a balance.  For most people, credit cards are one of the easiest ways to buy something online, since you can't hand cash through a computer screen and don't have to wait for a bank transfer.

I'm sure someone would be willing to pay for it, but I don't think it's a good idea.  The Bitcoin paradigm is that people need to take responsibility for their own security because losses are irreversible.  Sure, a third party could offer compensation for losses, but it's based on trust and there's no guarantee that a failed security protocol wouldn't bankrupt whatever firm was running it.  Nevertheless, I don't think that trusted third parties are going anywhere anytime soon.

Depends on the method.  I think Coinbase offers instant transfers with debit card purchases.  Bank transfers can take a couple of weeks before funds are available to be sent to external wallets from your Coinbase account.  I think.  Maybe someone else can verify.

I'll go one step further, concede every faulty assumption, and say, "I don't care."  Every accusation about bitcoin's contribution to climate change could be 100% true, and I still wouldn't care.

I'm looking to add bitcoin payments to my business right now, but I refuse to go down the road of letting payment processors skim from transactions.  I'll sooner invoice customers with public addresses I generate myself than enable the development of PayPal 2.0 in the bitcoin ecosystem.

Exactly, at a certain point of adoption, a snowball effect will occur and nobody will be able to control the pace of it.  At that point, bitcoin better be ready to handle it all and the fact of the matter is that block size alone is not a sustainable solution.  The Bitcoin Core route of trying out these second layer solutions earlier rather than later is absolutely essential to its long term growth prospects and success.
