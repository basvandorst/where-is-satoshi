If you look at all 6 points in this reply as a function of Time,  then I think they can all be overcome and as OP said, crypo is superior.
1. with time, crypto will be easy to understand for people
2. with time, people will learn better how to secure their wallets
3. with time, transaction costs will be reduced
4. with time, medium of exchange will grow.
5. with time, the price of bitcoin will stabalize
6. with time, crypto will be a standard of value.
Would I want to wake up tomorrow in a world where fiat was replaced with crypto?  no.  but in time - yes.

yep.  whenever there's a huge bull run, alts increase a ton compared to bitcoin,  but in these long bear markets,  they decrease just as fast,  but for much, much longer.

If a store employee has 100 or 1000 people asking if they take bitcoin, i'm sure that the owner will eventually hear about it. :)

I would encourage those places to get a bitcoin address for direct payments.  If the merchant is smart, they'll realize that a payment would be worth a ton of money in the future.
And if the concern is getting rid of bitcoin, then I'd suggest at the time of sale (from your bitcoin wallet to their bitcoin wallet), exchange more fiat for bitcoin a few seconds after.  Then there should be minimal bitcoin loss for you.

I think you're right, and I think this is one of the major long term challenges - deciding when to pay bills, rent, salaries, and so on in bitcoin or another crypto currency.  I'd want to say the answer on when to spend is the same as when to invest - do it ASAP.  It's like the world was gifted with a genius idea by satoshi, but the roadmap for successful worldwide implementation of it is rudimentary at best.  But probably in all cases, we have to start spending in it, and leave it to the merchant to decide what to do with it after.

What's the tax on a Big Mac that costs 120 satoshi?
