Today, they won't say. But the HK agreement about miners agreeing to not run alternativ clients to Core expired today and the representatives of Core didn't hold their words and there was rumors about miners running other clients so it's everyones guess. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 14:38:52
And doing soft forks all the time which Core only needs few miners consent with is okey? Having private meetings now and in future like FED and deciding the economy future is okey?

The problem is that there is still no layer 2 solutions which is not decentralized. And layer 2 solutions robs the miners of fees. Who is going to secure the main chain? And on top of that some devs are saying that they don't want Bitcoin to have mass adoption because of war or whatever. And then the same people say that they want block space to be scarce because then it's more valuable. And sometimes they also say that they want more to have as much as block size possible in future. And then they say Bitcoin should be self regulated so it doesn't get too much adoption, what ever that means. 
Because of these contradictory opinions by same people I start to believe on those conspiracy theories. 
@_date: 2016-08-15 17:29:39
Should have engraved that line from Satoshi that you only need to change 1 line to change block size. Either Satoshi was incredibly stupid or we are.

Why not just do hard fork then? That's the only way you can know that the network has embraced it. Bitcoin is in beta and needs to be fixed in many ways, and with Core blessing the hard forks will be safe and easy to do. These hard forks will not set any precedent.
@_date: 2016-08-15 21:02:13

I hear a lot about that there are problems with LN that seems at the moment to have no solutions. Is that correct? 
@_date: 2016-08-13 23:42:19
Satoshi didn't have fully anonymous transactions and now people want it on protocol level. Like I understand by Satoshis posts he didn't want them because he wanted Bitcoin to be legitimized and that wouldn't ever happen with fully anonymized transactions. But now edgy people say "haha bitcoin doesn't need governments premission lol". Satoshi seemed rational and not like these anarcho nuts who wants to live in wild west.

Yea someone started to talk about "efficient markets theory" and now everyone are talking about it. Look at what happened when last halving occurred. Look at what happens to alt coins when halving happens like with LTC.
This is really new kind of information we have about Bitcoin with the halving which differ from other markets, I don't think the old theories work here.

You know that this article is talking about what confirmations are and what 1 confirmation and etc means not how many conformations are safe. You always do this, you know what somebody is talking about but then you intentionally dismiss it and come it with stupid arguments.

@_date: 2015-12-21 00:29:17
It's core philosophy of Bitcoin and it doesn't matter if he said it half a decade ago. Satoshi said that he want Bitcoin to reach VISA level of transactions and the 1MB blocksize limit was just a temporary fix. He said that those level of transactions will not be a problem. He said that there will be fewer nodes and those nodes will be in big server farms. Don't you think Satoshi understood half a decade ago what this meant? Don't you think Satoshi knew what kind of "centralization" this brings which the Core devs are so much against? Don't you think this was very obvious back then too? In my opinion it was for everyone and obviously for Satoshi too.
Why did these devs start to develope Bitcoin if they were against the core vision which Satoshi had? Actually they didn't, they all said they want way bigger blocks, but 1-2 year ago they changed their opinion completely. Didn't Pieter know what kind of "centralization" 100 MB blocks would bring 1-2 years ago when he said 10-100 MB block raise would be OK? What did he and the other Core devs learn last 1-2 years what they didn't know before which changed their opinion completely?

Same here, really disappointed. Two years ago EVERY developer wanted bigger blocks, way bigger than 1-4 MiB. I don't see why change your opinion so much within two years when most of the developers has been there from at least 2011.
@_date: 2015-06-27 17:14:03
What annoys me is when core devs talk like this like Wladimir: "By using the system everyone agreed on one set of consensus rules, that was the "social contract" of Bitcoin. To me, the consensus rules are more like rules of physics than laws. They cannot be changed willy-nilly according to needs of some groups, much less than lower gravity can be legislated to help the airline industry."
The social contract was that the block size will be raised. Most people didn't sign up for a Blockchain which can only be used by few people. This is just helping alt coins like Litecoin more, now Litecoin seems like a really good hedge because core devs wants Bitcoin to only be used by minority.
@_date: 2015-06-11 19:58:30
Is anyone against block size increase who doesn't have any agendas?

Thanks for replying, I'm going to transfer all my bitcoins to new paper wallet, with the stickers and all that. I made my paper wallets before the heartblead bug was discoverred and the pc was online when I generated those paper wallets so I think it's time that I make more secure paper wallets before it's too late.

Thanks for your input. The cold storage I have is planned to be cold until 2017, so yes long term. What is Kibubik?
I folded my paper wallet and laminated it. Lately I have been paranoid about that maybe the private key which was generated could be faulty. It would cause me much hassle to make a new cold storage and laminate it again. Is there any probability that wrong private key could have been generated? I didn't know before that I should check if my private key gives the public key I have. Paranoia you know :)

- My smart printer was hard to install. I still can't scan on my Ubuntu.
- PDF  started to print slowly on my last install of Ubuntu, took like 2 minutes for 1 page. I googled and found it was usual problem on Ubuntu/linux.
- When I logged in, the desktop wouldn't load, had to google very much and found a solution after many hours of trying. My desktop has stopped loading several times. And the steps required to fix it takes atleast 10-15 minutes.
- I often get "Error found"  the "stop sign logo" on top tray bothers me every month, I have to manually install updates from Terminal to fix it.
- Watching streams like sites from HBO GO you need widevine which is so much hassle to install, and it works so slowly. I understand that this can't be seen as linux problem because widevine isn't supported on linux so you have to use third party software to get it to work.
Probably others which I can't remember atm, but I still use Ubuntu as my main OS because overall I prefer it over Windows. 
About the drivers on Windows, Windows has been very good to find drivers by itself and install from Windows 7 to Windows 8.

When I came into bitcoin for first time I heard about all the altcoins having faster transaction time and started to invest there, like Litecoin. But now I see that the transaction time is part of security. 
If everyone wanted to have faster transaction time in bitcoin, they just have to change the code to make transactions faster, 60 seconds or whatever. 
Changing to that would be very easy. Other altcoins are just copy pasting bitcoins code and chaning some variables to make transactions faster. Read up on why transaction time matters for security. I have burned money on altcoins before, I hope you won't get in same situation.

Soon prices will fall hard for ordinary SSDs and these super fast SSDs will just get cheaper and cheaper. The best thing is that Intel will compete hard with Samsung with these SSDs so the prices will fall fast. 
I don't think we have to worry about disk space or speed of it. We are in middle of disk revolution.

More interesting quote from Satoshi: "The existing Visa credit card network processes about 15 million Internet purchases per day worldwide.  Bitcoin can already scale much larger than that with existing hardware for a fraction of the cost.  It never really hits a scale ceiling.  If you're interested, I can go over the ways it would cope with extreme size."

If these guys were making bitcoin they would never come to decision about how many bitcoins there should ever be. I think Satoshi just thought of some variables and then said okey lets do 21 million.

I can't say that I disagree with anything you said there, I will stop that behavior and try to read carefully about what he says or just try to stay outside all the bitcoin subreddits. The whole situation is pretty stupid and childish. The only thing happening is that the other coin is getting traction while we are destroying Bitcoin. My best option would probably be to just sell off after holding for two and half years and stay away from internet drama.

The reason mentioned is one of the many reasons that I always downvote , many times before reading his post and I downvote all of his posts I see on threads, it's easy to find him because I have tagged him. And i'm far less passionate about the whole debate/drama and I think people often go over the line with stalking Greg and others. I have not been much on reddit lately but still RES tells me that I have down voted him 157 times: 
It's quite annoying with the conspiracy theories from both sides. I have heard you and theymos and Greg and others talk about shill accounts and vote manipulation and that the gang is only shills who are trying to destroy Bitcoin and/or have no stake in Bitcoin. When most of the other side is way more passionate than me it's easy to see how fast they they will downvote when his posts are so poisonous and often blatant lies. There is most likely not any bots on him or any other kind of vote manipulation.

New accounts pushing agenda is quite obvious, it was even obvious before but way easier to see now the the new flair they get. And those accounts are probably by people who are banned or don't want to be doxed. But you have to admit both sides have new accounts it's not only the "big blockers". And over at most new accounts are by those who doesn't like them. My guess is that they make new accounts becaues they don't want to get doxed and secondary is when they get banned. I don't think there is any more complicated answer than this.

The lower the transaction number is the better it is. Then the transactions has to compete and there will be a fee pressure. If less people can use Bitcoin it will be better. This is not a number to brag about, if it was 10 million it would be  at least 10x better. This is basic economy, I don't know why peasants don't get it.
@_date: 2016-03-21 15:48:16

I know a friend who has been telling me to invest in like 2-3 months. I checked GAW for 30 mins and found out they are scam. I have told my friend that he shouldn't invest more and cashout. But he is just cashing in more and more. You know bcs wsj(blog) wrote about GAW, and Amazon, Wallmart and other big retailers "have said they are going to accept paycoin". It's funny and tragic and the same time.

So why not do 2MB *and* kick the can down road and wait for better scalable solutions? Even Wladimir said he is all in for 2 MB hard fork. It seems like there is only few devs with very much influence stopping it from happening. They would rather divide the community.
@_date: 2016-06-26 14:07:57
Tell us when you started to think the block started to get full then. Yea you won't.

I will try to give those articles a try tomorrow but I don't know if I can read something Aaron writes. Anyway, it's not foolish, it's the deal and you have to respect that. I didn't like that they wrote a contract behind closed doors in first place, but it happened and now this is the plan. And everyone knows what will happen, Luke will say "this is the code...but no Core won't merge it" And indeed Core won't just because of a couple of devs, even Wladimir said he is all in for 2 MB fork but because those couple of devs apparently have so much influence he just doesn't do anything.
And please don't come up with consensus bs, there won't be consensus  (at least very hard) if Core doesn't put it on their road plan. Maybe next month when Antpool does something when the backroom contract is broken by Core then Core will make consensus in record time.
@_date: 2016-06-22 15:30:33
True to the mission. Man you are really sheep of your hero devs. What about Adams 2-4-8? Now Core rejects any fork because of very few devs. 
Even Wladimir says he is all in for the 2MB for but a couple of devs have so much influence that they can reject it.
@_date: 2016-06-22 21:23:14
True, but some people say it's far away from full even with all the evidence so I just say 90% full so it's 100% fact and can't be twisted.
@_date: 2016-06-22 20:53:11

You really think everything is fine when it's 90% full? You should start advertising as much as you can that Bitcoin can't handle new users anymore and they should move to other solutions. Seems like you think current amount of users are enough.
@_date: 2016-06-22 15:06:02


I'm not bothering to find sources, you can find them by yourself or you can ask Jonas. He said that he would work on Classic if it forked successfully. 


Are you saying that Greg or you have never said that people will stop using nodes if there is 2MB fork because they can't handle those big blocks? If you say yes then you are a big freaking lier.
@_date: 2016-06-22 14:11:21
You must be really happy about this because now "fee market" will start full on and the fees will rise really fast. Users will be very happy about this and definitely won't look for alternatives. Isn't this what you really wanted?
@_date: 2016-06-22 14:31:59
If there isn't any alt coin which competes with Bitcoin now there will come at one point if people think that 1MB is just fine and people will pay fees happily. And at that point it will be too late to do something.


At what point? When will you know that the time has come? When you are ignoring the urgency when the blocks are 90% full then I don't think you will ever realize that we should raise the limit. 
I think your problem is just that you are looking at your favorite hero developers and what they are saying without thinking by your self.
Months or even years ago they were saying HD space will run out with bigger blocks.
Then they said that China firewall can't handle it.
Then Xthin came out and they urgently merged Compact Blocks.
Then they said blocks are full for so *long time*.
Now 90% is OK and fee market will be great.
@_date: 2016-06-25 17:03:17
Untill recently you were saying that the blocks aren't full so don't know what kind of attention you are paying.
@_date: 2016-06-22 19:00:42
But SW will not activate because Antpool has repeatedly has said that they won't run anything with SW before there is a code and implementation plan for 2MB hard fork. Adam,  Peter and Luke went to them representing Core and told them this would be done. Adam and co didn't hold their side of deal so Antpool won't let SW activate. There is a deadlock because of stubbornness and it doesn't seem like there will be capacity raise for blocks and they will stay full. Antpool said that Core has till July as planned so I wonder what they will do after that. 
@_date: 2016-06-28 21:14:27

He also said after setting the limit that one day bitcoin will have so many transactions that the fees will pay for miners, he never talked about "fee market". Yea fuck that dude Mike Hear attacking Bitcoins with his lies, amiright?
@_date: 2016-06-22 14:58:12


It isn't bullshit, looks like you like to deny stuff with certainty even if you are wrong.


I was calling out your "Oh my god there are so many coders on Core and there isn't only few people denying the fork" And then you come up with that argument...


Waiting for solutions is no good. We have to be the change we want to see in the world
So why will 2MB be fine now when other devs like Greg said so many times that many people will have to stop nodes if we raise the limit to 2MB and that will be disaster?
@_date: 2016-06-22 18:31:24
And you are most likely referring to LN. There is big difference between main chain and other scaling like LN. And anyway LN is not even possible theoretically without being centralized. You want to strangle Bitcoin till it becomes a possibility, if ever.. Even the lead maintainer Wladimir said lets go for 2 MB hard fork and only couple of devs and mods on this sub and some strange users see a hard fork for raising limit as abomination.
@_date: 2016-06-22 14:22:00
"Lets create a artificial limit now so everybody tries to outbid everyone. This can't hurt Bitcoin in anyway because there is no other alternatives."
I thought the idea was that there will either so many transactions in future that the miners will get payed to secure the network or bitcoin will die. 
@_date: 2016-06-26 10:27:49
Oh wow, when it was 94% blocks weren't full and it all was spam.
@_date: 2016-06-22 14:14:23
It isn't shit, it's what many developers and users wants. Now the fee market will start and everyone will try to outbid each other. The fees will rise very fast and users will pay them happily because they will never think of looking at other alternatives.
@_date: 2016-06-27 21:16:15
Why did you and Adam go running to China to write a backroom deal so they don't run Classic if you weren't afraid for them doing a fork?
@_date: 2016-06-26 12:39:22
I'm not, I hope somebody goes through your history and finds the post. Meanwhile, can you tell us when you stopped saying it's all spam? 
@_date: 2016-06-23 07:35:29
Has anyone in Core even started to talk about flexible block size?
@_date: 2016-06-22 14:22:39
So in this point we have to give up on new users and adoption. Is that what you are saying?
@_date: 2016-06-30 18:26:44
I hope you are joking.
@_date: 2016-06-23 08:03:45
I can't find it here: 
Or is there other roadmaps too?
@_date: 2016-06-22 14:06:25
So when will you stop saying that everything is fine? When it's 99% full all the time?
@_date: 2016-06-26 12:34:16
Your post so much everyday and you probably know nobody will bother to go through it. Do you disagree that couple of months ago you were saying that it's mostly spam?
@_date: 2016-06-22 21:20:55
Yea there are geniuses over at Core, but in short I think some devs there have weird fetish about small blocks. Some say it's still too big when the average block is 90% full and want 750k blocks. Some has backtracked from their plans like 2/4/8. Some flies over to other countries to make urgent backroom deals. I would say it's hard to understand their motives. 
@_date: 2016-06-25 11:24:08
Maybe when the sub you are mod on had all the posts with advertisement about micro transactions years(s) ago you should have removed them or/and warned people about that this is settlement system and in future micro transactions won't work. But no you let them make all that false advertisement and lure new people by lies. Or maybe is it that you all just suddenly changed your mind and decided that Bitcoin is settlement system? As I see it's quite obvious that it's latter and I wonder why... 
@_date: 2016-06-27 21:31:54
How would they attack Core by running Classic, don't you anyway call Classic an altcoin? 
@_date: 2016-06-22 14:17:14
So when will we start thinking of a block size raise? When it's 99% full all the time? Or will that be time to reduce the size to 750k?
@_date: 2016-06-23 11:12:53
Yea that dude Satoshi and Mike were completely wrong about Bitcoin being digital cash and wanted it to be used as currency and not only commodity.
@_date: 2016-06-26 12:28:17
Like untill max couple months ago you were saying that it's all spam, weren't you paying attention then or your were you misguided or was it intentionally? Or you just repeat what some of your hero devs say without thinking?
@_date: 2016-06-22 14:50:00


Because they were waiting and watching if Classic gets traction or else they would get casted out from Core and they didn't want to take any chances. Jonas Schnelli said that he will work with Classic team if it takes over, and I bet many others will too.
94 people were credited, but most of the coding was done with way smaller majority. And only handful of them have very much influence in the community. 
@_date: 2016-11-15 18:22:42
It would be way more easy to just compromise 2-3 miners and destroy Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-11-28 15:19:24
How will the fee market work for miners when/if LN comes along? Everyone would just transact over LN because of the huge fees over Bitcoin and won't pay miners **anything**. Tired of everyones hypocrisy.
@_date: 2016-11-26 11:56:53
Why not hard fork to 2mb now and let miners set their clients to 1mb until segwit space is getting full? Whole fight between community will be over if we do that. 
@_date: 2016-11-20 01:43:04
Of course I was being sarcastic.
@_date: 2016-11-28 17:23:38
Your metaphor: "this restaurant is over-crowded, nobody goes there anymore" is so perverse. You are acting like other restaurants can never take their customers even if they raise their prices 2-10 times. Doesn't mean it will have monopoly in future if they do whatever they want.
The small blocks and huge fee fantasies are for getting LN adoption, and I would never want to use LN with centralized hubs when I have Bitcoin. But then I would have to use Bitcoin with huge fees because of perverted politics. 
@_date: 2016-12-07 23:08:56
Yea let's hope it works out, but if there wasn't "hard fork is evil" mantra for so long SW would probably be deployed by now. But yea agree it's long, boring and off topic discussion so let's leave that alone.

@_date: 2016-06-30 18:01:23
Yep, and they are saying that block size is too small and it's huge issue and people are moving to alt coins because of this. Everybody should listen to what they are saying here: 
@_date: 2016-11-29 07:29:52
Some devs from the competition started developing Bitcoin before you even heard about it.
@_date: 2016-12-04 18:29:15
I hope you see the difference between those two.
@_date: 2016-06-26 14:18:18
So people who were saying that blocks are getting full in May and were saying that should raise the capacity were full of shit?
@_date: 2016-11-28 20:10:18
Bitcoin's creator also said that miners will get payed by transactions fees because Bitcoin will either be **very** big or fail, that means Bitcoins's creator said that the blocks should be very big in future so we can pay miners for security. But you are trying to divert from that, and it's you screwing with it. LN will always be second class citizen.
And it's easier to just say Satoshi than Bitcoin's creator.
@_date: 2016-11-28 22:37:43

I agree that Satoshi isn't God but when you start saying that hard fork is almost impossible and should never be done or that the limited block space is precious then you are changing how Bitcoin was thought to be in the beginning.
I really don't get you though Greg. Lately you are saying that transaction backlog is like exchange orderbook and is very precious and sometimes you say that you want to raise the block size at least for LN because it will need that in future. Seems like you are just flip flopping. And when your followers in this sub are saying the raising fees are amazing then I feel disgusted. This kind of thought has been infested by people like you.
@_date: 2016-11-24 11:39:00

I heard about Bitcoin same time too and know many others who did the same and they all bought most after the rally. It's almost impossible to be in negative if you bought at ATH and bought some after too. You almost couldn't have bought $1100-1200 because it was there just for little while. And bitcoin has not even been over $700 for more than 4-5 months I think. So how the hell can you be in negative if you just didn't buy at $800-900 and forgot about it? If you just forgot about Bitcoin after you invested $800-900 then you could not have invested too much. Hell, Bitcoin was around $250 for a whole year and now it's at $700. Bitcoin has never been over $700 for so long before!

I agree that Luke-Jr answered in hindsight now. But midnightmagic didn't make any sense anywhere.
Edit: It's pretty weird answer by Luke-Jr IMO but yea he answered something.
You can see how vague all answers are. What is significant? And we who don't think XT is altcoin get's called troll all the time.
They NEVER tell you any specific just vague answers.

Few weeks earlier I was questioning about Blockstreams intentions, and that is trolling by midnightmagics definiton.
See my last 3 questions. I told him to tell me what kind of fork is not altcoin. He answered by saying: "That which is not developed by a majority of high-output, competent cryptographer and cryptography engineers, is a fork which I consider to be invalid."
So he called Gavin and Hearn incompetent and was offending them without answering my question and I said to him that he is not being serious and he banned me.
Edit: Try it for yourself if you question them about why XT is altcoin you will get banned pretty fast if midnightmagic is there.
If you want to look at the whole conversation here is it:

He can promote broken wallets which people lose money over all the time. But then he should be stopped to be seen as 'Bitcoin Jesus' or anyone who is positive for Bitcoin. It's his domain, he can do whatever he wants with it, but then people should warn about the money losing wallets he is promoting. 
Because of this yes he is definitely shady.
He went to their headquarters and said it's all fine. What the fuck did go there to see if not to just shill?

Satoshi forked the network without even telling anyone at the beginning because there were so few people using Bitcoin then so we can't use him as an example.
I don't get how anyone can say that UASF is good idea when corporates just can makes 1000s of nodes and easily signal for what they want. PoW is the best measurement we have to date and it's why PoW was always used as measurement to decide when to fork.

You are not afraid of fake nodes and/or corporates making farm of nodes to just vote on things which are in their favor? Even if miners can do same it's much smaller chance than someone like Microsoft. And like I said nodes can be faked easily and the only real measurement we have is hashpower.
@_date: 2017-04-25 13:28:19
Yea like UASF, bigger corporations just can start 10k nodes in one night and vote for what they like.
@_date: 2017-04-22 22:37:12
You should learn more about bitcoin, mother.
@_date: 2017-04-11 21:48:33
UASF would be a nice concept if there wasn't such thing as fake nodes etc. That is why PoW has always been the only measurement for anything in Bitcoin land.
@_date: 2017-04-12 17:43:36
I have heard something about your first point before and I think it was a good explanation about what happened and not exactly what you are saying.
Of course an invalid block will get rejected by nodes, but what you suggested before was that nodes rule and decide when we know how easily nodes can be faked. Nodes just check for the block they get from miners, they don't do anything else.
@_date: 2017-04-25 15:55:22
Do you know what UASF is?
@_date: 2017-04-12 17:30:14
And you are saying that it's better that the rich decide rather than PoW? And what about the exchanges, they can easily manipulate the markets. What you are saying is just so insane.

I cringe so hard every time I read "economic majority", you can't measure "economic majority". Can you please tell me how you can measure that? By deciding that x of y companies have to support UASF and x of y exchanges have to support UASF. Or is it by x of y sales of the exchanges and other companies? Can't you see how political and artificial this discussion about "economic majority" is?
Why did SW require 95% of hash rate if it doesn't matter that much at all?

Let's just pretend for a moment that there are only total 3 entities who are participants in the bitcoin economy. Could you tell me exactly how you would measure economic majority here? Would you see how much percent of total revenue between those 3 entities are supporting UASF?

Do you even know what the fuck Bitcoin is?
@_date: 2015-07-17 10:10:08
I used Neteller with Bitcoin once. I was going to deposit X bitcoins to Neteller and I had to first write how much I want to deposit in USD or any other fiat currency, you can't write how many bitcoins you want to deposit. So I wrote that I want to deposit X USD in bitcoins and they sent me to next page with QR code and bitcoin address which I can deposit to, this page didn't tell me how many bitcoiins I have to deposit so I calculated how many bitcoins equals X USD. Bitcoin is quite volatile and it is anyway hard to calculate the exact amount they equaled to that moment when I clicked next. So I sent little too much and Neteller didn't deposit bitcoins to my Neteller account. I had to contact them via email and they had to manually fix it next day.
Neteller uses Bitpay and I don't understand how they could implement so stupid solution. Neteller probably have to use much time on this.

For me at least it was always about that it seemed like Core was against hard forks at all cost, that they never want another hard fork. That really seemed shady, and that's why I in the beginning kinda bought in to the Blockstream conspiracy. I have even bashed you at the other subreddit several times.
The other thing was and is the censorship in here, all bad news about Classic/BU or alt coins got on front page but good news got censored. There were attacks against XT etc and no one from Core spoke up. That seemed also like there is a conspiracy.
And to be honest it always seemed like you have most influence on Core...kinda too much. It still seems like that to me, but it may not be true and I don't that it's malicious anyway.
SW should really have been announced way before the scaling conference and not been hidden for a "surprise" there, it just seemed like Core was stalling scaling all the time.

You have been brainwashed, hard forks has never been seen as dangerous. And all of your idols who are screaming that hard forks are dangerous were saying that we should hard for to raise block size.

How will you measure consensus for UASF? How will you know if the chain UASF forks to is Bitcoin or alt coin if you don't know how to measure consensus?
@_date: 2017-05-16 17:21:11
 I don't think it's bullshit metric, but for many alt coins it's bullshit metric because of various reasons like premining etc.
@_date: 2017-05-07 23:17:08
They are just not stupid.

What the fuck, I agree now with that this sub like to hail criminals. 
@_date: 2017-05-08 09:04:27
You degenerates always shouted that we can't hard fork because consensus. And now you can activate UASF because you suddenly know how to measure consensus?
@_date: 2017-05-14 13:11:40
You and all of your employees have been saying for **years** that hard for is impossible and brainwashed many people now by believing that a method for upgrading the protocol is impossible and dangerous. They have made this topic political when it was really obvious what to do before. If that all was **lies** and **it's** possible within 9-12 months now then hallelujah, lets wait 9-12 months. What's so urgent for you now? We have been with full blocks with no plan for years so we can wait up to 1 more year.
@_date: 2017-05-14 14:05:14

But many Core devs like has said that full blocks are good for Bitcoin so some of us thinks Core will just push SW and then do nothing in future when 1,79MB SW blocks becomes full. Because as I told you many Core devs likes that Bitcoin has full blocks for whatever reason.
@_date: 2015-11-07 07:42:03
There has been a lots of attempts for communications. Core devs are stubborn and won't listen. Theymos, Pieter etc wanted block raise before Blockstream, but now they won't hear of it.

Looks like only one person is trying to solve the biggest problem and it's Gavin . Such shame that other 'extremists' doesn't want to raise transactions per second. Even Satoshi said from beginning that he wants to match Bitcoins transactions with Visa one day and now they blame Gavin to be sell out.

Gregory Maxwell has said that the white paper is still correct and true to what Bitcoin is today. He mentioned that maybe the diagram on page 2 would have to change some arrow(s). Cobra didn't say what he thinks is wrong and outdated, but I would trust Greg more on this.

Ethereum forked successfully in a rush. Do you think what you have been saying about hard forks was too much FUD in hindsight now?
@_date: 2015-02-12 16:48:31
That makes sense, it can't come too soon. I wonder about how those "1 click to deposit" will work because 1 confirmation takes 10 minutes..
@_date: 2015-02-13 11:54:27
Because like i said saying fake volume sounds like shady exchanges.
@_date: 2016-07-02 16:59:03
Why not just have "More technical information" section or something like that on the site and explain whatever you want? By saying "update the white paper because it's **outdated**" is just plain wrong. He isn't saying that it lacks a lot of detail but that it's wrong now because it's **outdated**.
@_date: 2017-07-03 16:30:13
If you think alt coins are not getting traction and the market dominance trend is bullshit then you should stop supporting alt coins in your hardware wallet you hypocrite.

Every 4 year the production of Bitcoins halves. It started with 50 bitcoins every 10 minutes, then halved to 25 bitcoins every 10 minutes 4 years ago and today it halved to 12.5 bitcoins every 10 minutes. This will continue every fourth year until total 21 million Bitcoins are produced and then there will never be produced new bitcoins again, last halving will be on 2140.

What I don't get is how it will be possible to deposit and draw bitcoins at any country, because there are no laws almost anywhere about how they should handle bitcoins, and most places
bitcoin has to be taxed..
I wonder about how it will be in countries where poker is banned.

if I will able to deposit bitcoins at poker stars.

Civil war over block size, civil war over alt coin vs Bitcoin and many more. 
@_date: 2016-07-02 18:50:34
Fair enough, but In my opinion Cobra either worded it very badly or wants something different than what you are saying. He said that he wants to **update** the white paper and as said and many other are interpreting he wants to remove the paper from the current link and have updated version. He may even want to use Satoshis name there so it seems like he wrote it. Cobra also said that the paper is **outdated** and wrong for current state of Bitcoin. But as I said on my other comment Greg says that the paper is not outdated and still true to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-07-08 16:04:36

Does bitaddress.org seriously use Math.random() ??
What the fuck man, this sub *always* said to use bitaddress.org couple years ago and *no one* gave a warning about that. If you thought it was such bad idea to use bitaddress.org then why didn't you contact mods so they would have a sticky about it and try to warn users when they mentioned that site?
I have used that site and have all my bitcoins there, now I wonder if the private key is valid... 
Do you think Electrum is safe? What about Trezor or KeepKey?
And... how does bitaddress.org encourage address reuse? You mean they have larger chance to give same keys to different people than better implementations?

Who are people like me?
@_date: 2016-07-29 23:00:21


You are hilarious like butters.
@_date: 2016-07-09 23:08:08
Yes, they will get payed by the fees. The idea is that there will be so many transactions in future that the fees will be enough for miners.
@_date: 2016-07-26 15:14:18
It's like saying horses can fly, I don't want to argue against that.
@_date: 2016-07-26 17:24:34
Thanks for the reply, do you want to comment on Electrum, Trezor or KeepKey etc? Maybe PM if you don't want to criticize publicly. Would really appreciate it.
@_date: 2016-07-18 15:13:03
I think it's getting time to change the protocol so hard fork never will be possible again.
@_date: 2016-07-24 21:03:52
Ah, hard forks are stupid and should never be done. The FUD spreaders have done their job good I see. Fucking stupid Satoshi said that block size could be raised by two lines with hard fork.
@_date: 2016-07-28 12:26:25
Would you store a lot of money on Nano S?
@_date: 2016-07-31 14:33:54
Lmao that's what will happen. And people will fight/kill each other over which crypto currency they want as official currency for their country. Most of liberitarians are so stupid.
@_date: 2015-02-12 16:54:39
True, I had to buy prepaid card too so I gave up on online poker, I can't stand other sites. I'm waiting patiently.
@_date: 2016-07-28 18:35:42
How would you recommend to sweep paper wallet at the moment? I'm scared of making cold storage hot and then putting it to Nano.

@_date: 2015-02-11 21:29:06
Interesting, do you have link for where Gavin says that?
Edit: Or are you being sarcastic? Judging by your post history you seem to be against Gavin.
@_date: 2015-02-24 22:03:37
Think about things we don't know much about and read articles about that stuff everyday and get misinformed without knowing that.
@_date: 2017-06-18 10:42:37
If you don't want civil war for several more years and are not pumping alt coins you will obviously support this.
@_date: 2016-07-21 23:54:00
Why is this allowed here? and you hypocrites.
@_date: 2016-07-26 14:55:33
Reading about libertarians and anarchist self-governed government is always cringy.
@_date: 2016-07-09 18:37:11
Yes and that's why blocks has to be bigger, bitcoin is exactly designed with this in mind.
@_date: 2017-06-18 11:35:30
Bitcoin will be dead after this fork, this guy declared it. Go and buy eth or something else now.
@_date: 2017-07-02 16:53:59
The Core devs who have same opinion are bamboozled by Ver/Wu/Wright too?
@_date: 2017-07-02 13:35:03
You are funny.
@_date: 2017-06-20 20:13:37
Very likely.
@_date: 2017-06-25 11:17:41
This is what happens when keyboard warriors think they are important.
@_date: 2017-06-18 14:25:25


Are you asking yourself?
@_date: 2016-07-28 08:36:31
Is Trezor really *that* secure as everyone says?
@_date: 2016-07-26 15:30:42
People can't agree about anything, see the block size debate. IRL you anarchists would be killing each other. 
@_date: 2016-07-02 18:56:54
But according to many people the fee market starts when blocks are full for real, like 99% all the time. And they are looking forward for that, when it starts then your graph will be more exponential than the bitcoin price.
@_date: 2016-07-18 14:29:59
Should only bump to 1.0 when it's possible to do everything with softfork and nothing can't be done with hardfork which can't be done with softfork. Before that it's still in alpha.
@_date: 2017-07-01 14:39:31
Edgy. Who would they beg, keyboard warrior?
@_date: 2016-07-28 17:30:55
Is that in work?
@_date: 2017-06-25 12:45:46
I thought Core was way bigger than 25 people?
@_date: 2017-06-18 11:25:05
SW will be soft forked and it will come before the hard fork. What you are saying is that you want it only your way or nothing at all.
@_date: 2017-06-18 11:21:59
Core can get compatible with this and everyone will run the Core client.
@_date: 2017-06-18 11:41:38
"Omg people who has most skin in the game came together to find a solution for years long civil war. How dare they? Literally evil."
@_date: 2017-06-18 14:21:22
If you mean that over 90% of miners are goons then you should already quit Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-18 10:45:21
Yea, they should have meeting in the central park with cameras which are live streaming.
@_date: 2017-06-18 11:34:32


You get SW and stuff like LN with this compromise...?
@_date: 2016-07-02 16:47:17
I don't see how you think that didn't understand what said. It's clear that btcdrak was saying that Cobra wants to update the existing white paper on the same link and presenting it as the original white paper.
@_date: 2017-06-18 11:31:04
With your mentality bitcoin would be in dead lock for ever. Do you by any chance pump alt coins?
@_date: 2016-07-08 10:43:23
I see now why I have tagged you as edgy.
@_date: 2016-07-23 21:10:36
Adam and Luke went to China in hurry to write a contract with the miners so they wouldn't run anything else than Core and they promised a HF code by end of July. These guys didn't keep their word and are trying to twist their own words. You can read the contract it's online but they are even trying to twist the written words. 
CEO of the biggest miner is getting tired of their lies and I suspect they will start considering running alternative clients to Core after this months ends, because by then Adam and Luke has broken their words. Adam, Luke, And Todd (and some other, maybe BlueMatt?) went to China and tried to represent Core and promised HF Code for 2MB. 
You can see how Jihan who is CEO of the biggest mining pool is getting tired of the lies. I can't link to the other sub, but this is what Luke said: "Nobody ever promised SegWit's release by any specific deadline."
And Jihans response: "lolllllll"
Jihan has tried to be reasonable and held his words, but it seems like he is getting frustrated by the lies. Next few months will be interesting.

It is tho, enough is enough. This war has been going hard for years and it's alt coiners dream that we keep going on with it.
@_date: 2013-11-26 16:10:54
But it is easier to mine Litecoin. If people get interested then the volume would rise very quickly.
@_date: 2016-07-26 18:53:25
In Libertarian land they would go out and murder each other over the block size debate. And after short time everyone would be dead or escaped from the mental land.
@_date: 2016-07-02 17:00:19
He is at least co-owner of bitcointalk.org with I don't know more about him, I don't think others do either. Or maybe it's not bitcointalk.org, but bitcoin.org or both...

Never bought Eth or ever had interest in it. But i'm just not edgy fuck as you.
@_date: 2017-06-21 17:43:55
Many of us don't want to buy stolen goods.
@_date: 2017-06-18 11:45:56
So if majority of the economy and users go wit sw2x then Core is right anyway?
@_date: 2017-06-18 12:44:31
I use app on my phone to transfer money over Wester Union, it takes about 15 seconds to use the app and send money. After 10 seconds the money is available on other side of the world.
Last time I sent money the fee was around 1.3% of the transaction.
@_date: 2017-06-18 11:27:12


This is not ultimatum, this is compromise, I have learned that many people here don't know what that is.
@_date: 2015-02-12 16:26:58
I don't care if it takes a year till they implement it, I just hope it's implemented correctly so it's as easy as to set in bitcoin and start playing. The most awesome thing would be that you could cash out bitcoin from poker stars, but that's maybe only wishful thinking?
@_date: 2017-06-18 15:38:13
You and your dozens of friends can stay on alt coin yes.
@_date: 2017-06-20 13:30:34
He is probably more important to Bitcoin than btcdrak.
@_date: 2017-06-18 11:44:14


If you feel bullied you have some mental problems. Anyway you are not making any sense, I am done here.
@_date: 2016-07-09 20:26:19
Did I say unlimited? And do you want bigger blocks and more transactions to get more fees or smaller block and more expensive transactions to get the fees you want?
@_date: 2016-07-30 00:42:15
It's just FUD campaign here by mods and Co.
@_date: 2016-07-22 09:06:51
Bitcoin is technology and if it doesn't evolve it will get replaced. The FUD about hard forks is really hurting Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-25 23:58:05

Cool, thanks for the tip.
@_date: 2013-11-25 21:25:50
Does 1 adress have only 1 private key?
@_date: 2013-11-26 16:09:52
Because for me it looks like that Litecoin is rising slowly, after few years it could reach up very high. But who knows what will happen..
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:25:01
 is safe, Sturle is cool guy.
@_date: 2013-11-25 08:47:01
Will look at those, thanks
@_date: 2013-11-26 17:15:23
What about that Litecoin tranfers faster and it is much better to use in such as gambling websites etc?
@_date: 2013-11-26 16:11:55
Was thinking the same, I bought 1 Bitcoin yesterday. And I am thinking about too buy Litecoins for another 0.5 Bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-12-26 00:02:33
Can you please explain what you mean by that MultiBits wallet backups expires?
@_date: 2013-11-25 20:03:36
So stupid by me, thanks!
Could you answer my other question too? Do I only need to backup private keys or other stuff too?
