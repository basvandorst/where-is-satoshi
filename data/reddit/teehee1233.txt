Google's definition is inaccurate.
Or at least it's too descriptive rather than prescriptive (or whatever the different dictionary philosophies are).
@_date: 2019-07-13 01:16:27
Slashdot still exists?

Do Americans still wear cargo pants?
And 5/8th length pants at that?!

Well, and turning over functioning farms owned by white people to groups of Africans who just destroyed it all.

Well, he's posting the address for a wedding so we donate some money.
There are people here who stick a few bucks in any address they hear a sob story for.
( bc1qlre4jdqpwas2nwzqksg89pecm06yrwtxsy8kny if there's anyone like that watching!)
@_date: 2019-08-24 07:46:00
Haha, what an absolutely cock-ish thing to do!

I've often wondered whether lotteries have some sort of "chaos salt" that stops time travellers from being able to win lotto?
For instance, if it's a ball draw, chose the set of balls or the time they're being mixed by the number of tickets sold and the timing of each purchase.
This way, no one could go back in time and buy a ticket without unpredictably affecting the actual result.
@_date: 2019-06-02 22:21:18
Not really.
@_date: 2019-06-01 23:23:59
Yeah, none of it makes sense.
@_date: 2019-06-01 22:54:11
Fucked if we know, just here waiting for vegeta memes.
@_date: 2019-06-01 01:24:43
That customer doesn't have to wait 20-30 minutes for enough confirmations.

What's stonetoss?
@_date: 2019-06-19 09:10:41
Yeah, none for 49 minutes, then five within ten minutes.
All different pools though.
Has it been proven mathematically that every starting sequence has an SHA hash that can output leading zeros?

In all honesty, he probably has the opinion that gets him the most attention.

If I knew for sure I could turn 500 into 3000 in a week, I'd use my own money instead of doing it for other people.
You don't need to know the detail of this scam if you think about fundamentals.
It's not a sure thing.
@_date: 2019-06-04 03:53:43
We won't get a chance :(
@_date: 2019-06-22 21:15:25
None of those examples look particularly Nazi.
Is it because he defended red hat guy?
@_date: 2019-06-16 10:48:37


Off topic, but I'm sure you're right.
I wonder if there are any scifi books where time travel is easily done, but only in the forward direction?

One thing is has going for it is duration of existence, and also the amount of energy already put into mining it.
Many trillions of calculations, billions in energy cost. Bitcoins aren't made from nothing, they're a representation of used up electricity.
@_date: 2019-06-01 01:20:28
It's been in pipes for ages.
Lightning doesn't work for anything useful.
You'd need a layer above that, and in that case you'd just be using another form of cash with a bitcoin reserve.

According to this sub it cures cancer!
@_date: 2019-06-17 05:40:05
Yeah, but it will still have a negative effect on greenhouse gases.
@_date: 2019-06-16 18:46:33
I think lots of people think about things that are impossible.
Whether it's talking to a dead relative, being with the girl on the porn you're watching, or fantasising what you'd do with a million dollars.
I believe it's called imagination, and it's one of the things that sets humans apart from other animals.
@_date: 2019-06-01 06:10:40
No. Neither do most retailers.
Also, you have to pay to open a channel.
@_date: 2019-06-01 01:18:27
It is for lemonade.
@_date: 2019-06-01 22:53:09
Exactly. There's a good exchange that started as a Magic The Gathering Online Xchange.
Keep your money in something like that.
@_date: 2019-09-05 10:45:20
The Wikipedia article on interest mentions that a church forbade interest rates of higher than 1% per month.
It's not a great article, but read the history section.

How many satoshis for a McAfee special?

Can confirm, am lemonade sales executive.
@_date: 2019-05-15 23:01:13
Wow, there's that much money going into promoting bitcoin companies in the USA?
That would be a reasonably expensive ad!

"That'll be one dollar for the lemonade, let's wait for one confirmation....
"Btw, you'll need to spend about $10 in fees to get it in the next confirmation."

I'm only a grammar Nazi.
@_date: 2019-05-15 23:06:55
Things weren't more "organic" then.
They used swathes of DDT over everything!
Unless by organic you mean "likely to spoil easier, and not as fresh", which things would have been at the shops then.
The free market has forced farmers to use less fertiliser and insecticide, and to ensure quality produce.

Clearly the Libyans.

Can normal people use Lightning now?
@_date: 2019-05-15 02:25:09
So does gold mining.
At least bitcoin effectively uses energy, which is as basic a fundamental unit as you can get in the universe.
It's only really a problem while we use coal and gas generators, which we know will stop really soon...
@_date: 2019-05-29 02:30:22
Of course a whole lot of people bought in those 152 days.
@_date: 2019-05-16 00:54:43
Coinmama is legit. And they accept non Americans.
I used them years ago when I was just learning. There are probably cheaper ways in most countries, but they won't scam you.
@_date: 2019-05-15 05:01:12
Yeah, 11000AD is probably going to be when you worry about gold mining from an asteroid bringing down the price.

Are they active readers?
I'm sure many of us make a new account every few months.
@_date: 2019-05-15 02:13:23
But that only happens until it doesn't.

They're there to push their own agendas not yours.

Didn't they think 9000 sounded better?
@_date: 2019-05-28 02:09:59
Most of us will sell at $100K, fomo back in at $250K, miss selling at the ATH at $300K, for it to plateau at $150K for many months.

I just bought some lemonade with a zero fee. They'll probably never get my coin.

The point is, if I spend 15 rupees to get a rickshaw driver to take me down the road, I don't have to pay a ledger man 250 rupees to do that.

Takes money to get into a lightning network doesn't it?

It's called a dead cat bounce.

Exactly. That's why I still use friendster.
