How does the Bitcoin protocol apply specifically to any of those? You can't seriously be implying the protocol is responsible for p2p implementations over the last 20 years.
 
Content distribution - torrents/p2p file transfers; a decentralized peer list/torrent repository maybe?

It's a lot cheaper than PayPal and external bank transfers, but everything else you listed isn't really a valid argument.
Transfers are not faster.
"Know where your money went" addresses are psudeo-anonymous, so not really.
Security: People here keep saying this but I don't see it - if a person is incompetent enough to expose their bank/processor digitally, then their wallet is likely as susceptible. Additionally, you lose out on insurance and fraud protection with cryptocurrencies. 
This guy did fine IMO. Feel free to get up there yourself.

I did read your post and I assumed you meant the price would drop and recover, like it's been doing, except to the point his investment would become profitable. 
If you're implying the price will drop due to speculators fleeing and likely not rebound to an absurdly high price (that people seem to fantasize about here), then I apologize and agree.

There's enough room for subjectivity regarding the fairness of a supposed currency that benefits those who got in earlier than others. The decision of some new world currency isn't going to come from one or few people, and definitely not from stakeholders in an existing system.
The point is, in this hypothetical post-fiat situation, alternatives will exist. Most notably, people can still use the bitcoin protocol, with likely a more fair distribution method, and circumvent people like yourself who think they're entitled to something for contributing practically nothing.
I find it strange that you're having difficulty grasping any other possibilities besides the one that potentially makes you rich.

The software is reliable enough for illegitimate markets.
You're incorrectly making the correlation that third-party development is solving protocol issues. As [Hearn](  has been repeating over the last two months, core development is both underfunded and understaffed.
*None* of those developers are helping address core issues, they're after their own implementation profits. I don't blame them, it's just silly how members think there's this huge collaborative effort towards development.

Disclaimer: I'm from You haven't been paying attention if you think enthusiastic ancap ideologues are what gives bitcoin its persistence. Bitcoin is *amazing* at what it does, it does it well, and it's not going away any time soon - not that the "investors" in this sub care to acknowledge where it really comes from.
You'll keep telling investors to be patient - but patient for what, exactly? Realistically, what monumental event are investors waiting for? Bitcoin has *already* succeeded, and just because you or any other carpet bagger wants larger returns, doesn't mean it's going to magically happen over time.
Hopefully, enough of you get-rich-quick Austrian "economists" throw in the towel so this technology can evolve.

I'm in the same boat you are - no financial investment, the tech is interesting, the libertarian babble is entertaining, and believe the currency gimmicks aren't likely to hold.
I want to see what happens to the blockchain when the value drops to the point where miners don't find it profitable. I'm guessing the whole thing collapses, which would raise some questions about how useful and 'revolutionary' the tech actually is.

If this hypothetical doomsday occurred and bitcoin was decided as the best alternative, why would they (the general population) use the current implementation (empowering a miniscule percentage), instead of forking the protocol so they can provide a much more fair wealth distribution?
The current network is nothing if entire nations were willing to adopt the technology. Most people currently don't need bitcoin, and if a time ever comes when they do need it, it won't be in favor of a few bag holders when the technology is easily accessible to exclude them.

If only there was some digital monetary convention that the masses could intuitively use without having to constantly worry about their money being irreversibly stolen.
