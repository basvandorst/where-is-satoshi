When some grandpa tells this joke 40 years from now,  everyone will wonder where it originated.
@_date: 2019-07-04 17:40:19
Came here to say “seed”
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:45:12
I bought at 2 k,  gf finally bought at 18k, here is me as I’m watching the price plummet ��
@_date: 2017-12-01 12:58:56
I was out with a bunch of doctors last night at a work function and I would say bitcoin was 10% of the conversation.  All of their husbands are trying to invest after it 10k.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:49:40
Lol,  it’s a good thing I give good dick.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:27:23
No,  she had just been listening to my success story for the past how many months and decided to move her little acorn but over to bitcoin.   I’m not concerned at all and feel that this is a healthy correction.  We are both in for the long term.  But it’s kinda funny to see.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:49:20
Sure,  the price we were looking at was so obviously over inflated.  I was and would be skeptical if it just kept growing.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:14:19
�� I’m not into debating trolls.  Cheers!

Can someone eli5?

This is great, but is English the second language for the writer of this article/ news source? (Serious question)
@_date: 2017-08-07 00:03:34

Lmfao! This meme represents my mood when I saw the price this morning
@_date: 2017-08-01 22:20:35
Hopefully this stagnation is the "instability in the network" and really the price has skyrocketed and we just don't know it yet.
@_date: 2017-08-12 12:17:32
Beautiful sight to wake up to.
@_date: 2017-08-12 12:59:06
I'll buy stuff.  When my $1000 investment can buy me my dirt bike, a boat, and a condo at the beach :)
@_date: 2017-08-30 22:26:58
What payment method did you use?!   That same transaction cost me about 3$

This is amazing
@_date: 2017-08-06 13:38:47
Unless something catastrophic occurs in the Bitcoin realm,  it's probably a safe bet that it will be worth more that what you put in after a year.  The longer you wait, the more likely you will miss out.  Watch it carefully and pick a value that you will sell at(granted that you will withdrawal after a year anyway).  It is ad useable to only buy what you are willing to lose.

Best way to tank the credibility of any organization.
@_date: 2017-08-30 15:31:48
Very solid advice
@_date: 2017-08-14 16:35:07
Great perspective.  This needs to be understood better.
@_date: 2019-08-15 16:25:50
Came here to get rich, stayed for the ideologies
@_date: 2019-10-31 12:55:31
I believe there is the yen and the Japanese yen.
Edit:  a little google- it’s Chinese yuan.
@_date: 2019-06-24 02:01:50
.... what I really wanted to say is that I made all my friends aware that we were entering a bull run... one of them messaged me today to tell me that he bought in.  Shortly after, we dropped 5%.
@_date: 2019-08-09 04:05:34
Well thanks for making the price drop ��
@_date: 2019-06-05 03:30:05
Lol, not offended by any means.  And perhaps you are correct, thank you for the insight.   But I do stand with my original perception that using the term Bros here is pretty binary.
@_date: 2019-02-27 19:31:56
Lol great catch!!!   Best movie I have seen in years!!
@_date: 2019-06-05 03:15:44
Why do we assume all hodlers are bro’s.  I’m most certainly not a woman,  but I do think you talking to your audience and assuming they are ‘bros’ is a bit sexist.
@_date: 2019-06-22 11:56:09
I have already heard the “I thought bitcoin is dead” statement, I literally just laughed and said “I guess it wasn’t”
@_date: 2019-06-24 01:43:59
@_date: 2019-08-23 16:28:24
Blatantly preying on peoples ignorance.  Yup,  totally want to get behind that all day.    
(Uncle joe hears me talking about bitcoin and thinks,  let me check this out.  Types into google, bitcoin.com.  This is the shit he is presented with?  Fuck off Ver”min” )
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:07:00
The Bach propaganda is strong right now,  definitely taking full advantage of recent developments to fear monger. 
@_date: 2019-12-26 14:30:47
What are the decentralized platforms?  I’ll follow you there
@_date: 2019-12-31 03:42:24
I love this
@_date: 2019-04-06 21:23:50
This didn’t age well today
@_date: 2019-04-17 13:28:17
There was a lot of effort in this video to be so anti bitcoin.  Obviously there is an agenda.
@_date: 2018-02-24 14:31:46
@_date: 2017-09-18 00:31:23
This needs to go public,  it would be so beneficial to the power of the coin
@_date: 2018-02-17 19:14:27
Maybe they should use block chain technology
@_date: 2017-09-13 13:44:04
My selfishness hopes it stays this low until next Thursday ��
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:53:33
I'm thinking yes.

I'm a 12 year old boy delivering newspapers in Houston.   Every penny counts more.  My address is ahdund$:"($$//

The beauty of this meme is that the concept is very easily learned.  There just needs to be more conversation about it.
@_date: 2017-10-22 01:29:19
Following to see you complain next week when you should have bought at 6k.
@_date: 2017-09-11 21:46:07
I'm hodling,  but I haven't seen it go anywhere...
@_date: 2017-09-13 16:02:59
Then for your sake I hope it sky rockets on Sunday ����

I work pretty close to this place,  time to get some pizza!!!
@_date: 2017-10-15 12:43:27
I'm camping this weekend and I was trying to explain to all my buddies how it's different from fiat.   Even after trying to explain how basic currency is a representation of goods and services,  all they could say was,  "but still the value of bitcoin is backed by the American dollar, and the American dollar is a total scam" ��‍♂️ so close yet so far away.
@_date: 2018-07-10 13:11:32
Great bike,  I rode one once,  it was a such a stark difference from the sv650 and dl650 I own. I was trying to explain this to the girlfriend,  I totally get why people own 3 different vehicles,  you get such a different ride out of each. Like my xr650l to dl650 are sooooo different from each other but can go the same places 90% of the time.
@_date: 2018-07-10 13:01:52
Lol always cracks me up when owners call out other owners by the correct manufacture badging.  I do it with my motorcycles. But it always tickles me to see others do it.    It’s like a mating call.
@_date: 2017-07-21 00:45:50
But it's pending at a stamped time and date of transaction initiation.  Can't you just do the math to see the value of your coin?
@_date: 2017-07-09 19:01:29
Thank you
@_date: 2017-07-10 14:14:32
Then why the fuck is the price acting like this right now.   Gahhh
@_date: 2017-07-14 19:56:36
Sounds like you don't know either.
@_date: 2017-07-24 19:43:27
The mobile app is crap for that part,  you need a computer with a web cam to take pics of your US ID.  I had such a hard time with this.  Bitcoin went from 1500$ to 3000 before I was verified.
@_date: 2017-07-21 15:25:29
So, I'm,  where's that record you promised.
@_date: 2017-07-25 19:35:04
I'm looking forward to the next 1500 dip,  I've saved up a few bills that are burning a hole in my pocket
@_date: 2017-07-13 03:00:34
I am most definitely in for the long haul,  but who doesn't like seeing it go up?!
@_date: 2017-07-10 21:31:42
I know, :/ I'm suffering from watching the crap everyday.  I have faith in the tech.  I am just experiencing terrible timing issues with my coin purchases.
@_date: 2017-07-10 16:55:58
Buy low right?  Since I started investing, (say what you will about my motivations) every time I purchase, it drops �� 
@_date: 2017-07-13 13:17:08
Thank you for the mindset adjustment.  Newish concept to me.  
@_date: 2017-07-25 19:21:49
