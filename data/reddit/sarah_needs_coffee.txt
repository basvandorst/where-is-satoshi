In 1000 years computers will likely be able to to access all wallets. With enough computational power, even the best security is useless.
Edit I was wrong about the addresses and math. But the part were computers in 1000 years will have your bitcoin, I still belive.

He probably has multiple wallets and said that to let people know you can have small increments.

Ok I was wrong about the addresses. But you are assuming we will get to the limit of traditional computers and stop. I doubt that will happen. It is true traditional computers that run with silicon are almost as good as they ever will be. We have only had computers for a short time. In 1000 years there will be another type of cumputers. Quantum computers show promise and will likely be magnitudes stronger in computational power per watt than anything we have. And who's to say we don't find something better than quantum computers 1000 years from now.
I also don't think that in 1000 years we will have the same problems with power. We can mine asteroids soon, like 50 years probably. Then we can start harnessing everything our sun makes with a dyson sphere.

Your assuming quantum computers are the best we will ever have. In 1000 years a lot will change. There are thing out there that we don't have the technology to discover yet. I'm willing to guess computers will be able to crack everything that a modern computer can make.
Edit. The part where i thought i knew how btc addresses worked was wrong.

So I made a few errors when trying to say what i meant. The inputs to the hash functions can't be guessed with brute force by modern computers. But in a 1000 years I think we will have enough computational power to just start trying inputs until theres no possible other input for the hash. 
When I made my address i had a 16 word key. This key is not impossible to guess. Although modern computers can't guess that fast it doesn't mean 1000 years from now computers wont be able to guess 16 words. A quantum computer built near pefect the size of a sugar cube will have more computing power than all modern computers combined. Instead of working 4-8 problems at ghz speed it is possible to do trillions at ghz speed per atom. 
With that much power you can try every seed and every key possible.
My point is 1000 years is a long time. The first computer was made not even 100 years ago.

I am suggesting trying 4 billion checksum values per address. I think in 1000 years we would be able to do that easily. 
Also I edited that because you're right. I was wrong about how it works and my math was wrong on top of that.
