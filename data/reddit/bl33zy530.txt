I'm not saying 100k is forsure gonna happen by the end of the year but we've seen parabolic moves like that in bitcoin before, including the last rally 2 years ago when it reached 19k. So it's possible. 
What's laughable is how retarted you must be to somehow believe that bitcoin will only reach 15k by 2024, especially since in this last month alone, btc has gone up 43%($3,388). 
So a correction is likely on it's way,  setting a new floor which seems like 10k, followed by a new parabolic increase to it's new ATH past 20k. In fact, if you want to set up a bet with me and bookmark this post, I bet you 100$ of bitcoin that it will hit 15k in the next month.  Want to take that bet?
@_date: 2019-07-05 03:53:36
Uhh..no, no one or very few believed it would hit 100k in 2017. You're just making shit up at this point. 
Not to mention that this time around is MUCH different because corporations, banks and institutional money was not getting into crypto and blockchain, where as today all three are starting to see that bitcoin and crypto as a whole is going to be the next step in the evolution of currency. For example, Facebook itself is creating it's own centralized token, Libra. Amazon is now excepting ethereum. Many large stores like Whole Foods is accepting payment of bitcoin, etc. We are in the early stages of mass adoption and bitcoin is well on it's way to passing 1trillion market cap. 
You simply dont understand that BTC is becoming digital gold. And I garauntee that in 5 years or so, you're going to severely regret not buying more bitcoin right now while it's cheap.  I hope you remember this very conversation that we are having and realize that your unwillingness to take a risk is exactly what holds you back in life.

Takes 2 days for us wallet to recieve fund though am I right? Or can I instantly buy back?
@_date: 2019-07-14 17:25:34
Yup. Perfect time to buy.
@_date: 2019-07-05 01:00:24
Haha riiiickkkkkkk
@_date: 2019-07-03 23:35:38
So I've been waiting the last day or so for it to go back to under 11k but now with this recent pump, it doesnt look like that's gonna happen. I'm holding long term so should I simply buy now or be patient and hope it corrects down again?
@_date: 2019-07-05 03:10:01
Your math and numbers clearly dont freaking add up then kid. If you invested $1000 just 2 and a half months ago when btc was 3300, you would have almost tripled your money at the current price. 
And it's clear you suffered from massive FOMO 18 months ago and bought at the WORST time, and as a result you are in the red. 
You again prove yourself that you dont know mu h about the market because the markets go in CYCLES. We were in a bear market after December 2017 up until 3 months ago, and now we are clearly on our way to a BULL MARKET. 
Like so many noobie investors, because you lost money investing at the end of a bull market, you've become so discouraged by your loss that you think bitcoin is a scam, blah blah blah. You could of been investing while the market price was down but you didn't,  so you're still in the red.  And I'm sure when the market starts really taking off again, you'll FOMO and buy when the price is high and sell when it dips instead of the other way around. Classic rookie investor lol.
@_date: 2019-07-07 04:49:31
I've had a 100% return over the last 3 months. Wtf are you talking about?
@_date: 2019-07-07 18:07:18
It's not a get rich quick scheme and anyone who believes that clearly is just retarted. If you're gonna invest in something you believe in, be prepared to hold for at least 5-10 years.
@_date: 2019-07-05 04:02:54
You were the one who decided to laugh at my prediction and now you're salty because you got called out on it. I have no sympathy for people that didn't do their research before investing and instead chose to chase the riches and buy in when it was at its ATH. Its nobody's fault but your own that your in The red and now that you are so pessimistic that bitcoin will do well because you happened to lose money is pretty laughable in itself. If you cant take the heat, then stay out of the kitchen. You'll only get eaten up by people who know to BUY THE DIPS AND SELL THE HIGHS.
@_date: 2019-07-05 02:42:41
I honestly think you must have no idea how crypto works at all. My guess is you have little to no experience investing in crypto and as a result, seeing a 7% drop in BTC's price creates major FUD in your mind but the reality is, that's just a small correction due to bitcoin going up 43% this month. 
And I called you a retard because you felt the need to laugh at my expense for suggesting that bitcoin could hit 100k in a year or two, which many other crypto analysist's believe is possible as well. So again, based on your reply, I think I'll trust these analysist's over your clear lack of experience and knowledge of btc and crypto as a whole.
@_date: 2019-07-05 01:03:05
Honestly, you WANT this to happen if you plan on investing as much as you can. Be patient and simply buy as much as you can while it's still cheap( relatively speaking). It will hit 20k sooner or later but for now, stack up them sats as fast as you can whils you can.
@_date: 2019-07-05 01:05:16
I give you permission to laugh when I end up being righr����
@_date: 2019-07-05 04:24:20
You keep saying you look at the numbers but clearly you dont because if you did, youd see the pattern that after every large bullrun that's happened about every 2 years with btc since 2010, a LARGE RETRACEMENT(usually 50%) always follows. So when the next bull runs occurs, which WILL HAPPEN...a correction will happen and a NEW FLOOR will be set. So say we hit a new ATH of 80k after the next BTC halvening, a retracement down to something like 40k or maybe even 20k will happen, but it will still be higher then what its ath was during the last bullrun. This is how ALL MARKETS work. Now of course nobody can predict t exactly WHEN these retracements will happen, but as long as you hold through the bear market, you'll be fine.
@_date: 2019-07-10 01:20:16
Coinbase is definitely noob friendly and that's really what I am at the moment. Fees are a tad high too but it's really out of straight convenience at the moment.
@_date: 2019-07-05 04:50:08
Bro, you literally have the dumbest logic I've ever heard. Just because you're still down doesnt mean btc is a bad investment. What part of in the last month alone, btc has gone up 43% and in the last 3 months it's gone up 117%? 
It would take you over 12 years in the regular stock market to make a return that btc has made in the last 3 months. 
I cant tell at this point if you're deliberately trolling or just flat out a fucking retard. You're unwillingness to invest in the last 3 months is why you're still in the red and nothing more. Bitcoin has already gone way up and here you are still trying to convince me that somehow "numbers dont lie". I just gave you the numbers but something tells me that those numbers are gonna go in one ear and out the other. Its literally like talking to a rock with you. At this point, I'm wasting my time because you're just too dumb for words to describe. Doesnt matter to me cuz while you're too scared to invest in on the dips, I'll be here continuing to increase my bag and make a bigger return then the S&amp;P 500 could for me in a 10 year period.( which I'm also invested in). Stay ignorant chump. And watch bitcoin continue to climb to new heights while you stay broke and homeless living in your car lmao
@_date: 2019-07-07 05:07:28
Except btc in 5-10 years could very well become the new currency where we spend satoshis on everyday products and people no longer would want to convert their btc into fiat, which continues to lose its value. So btc will most likely become digital gold after all
@_date: 2019-07-04 00:16:48
What do you think it will pullback to? I'm a long term holder so I'm considering buying more now but should I wait for a possible correction?
@_date: 2019-07-05 05:33:57
Holy shit...I think you legitimately might have a mental disorder. No wonder you're living out of your car.  You have the social IQ of a turnip and clearly cannot demonstrate any semblance of logic or reasoning. You dismiss reality and instead choose to live in your delusional little fantasy world. It's clear I'm wasting my time trying to persuade you the merits of investing in bitcoin during this obvious bullrun. And why should I care? That just means more btc for me to buy.  
Try and lay off the crack pipe son. It's clearly doing you a disservice. 
Bye felicia.
@_date: 2019-07-05 05:08:39
Fool....for the LAST time...if you bought bitcoin at literally ANY time in the last 8 months and simply DCA(dollar cost averaging) by spreading out small investments in bitcoin, you could of recovered your money and some. Bitcoin from the start of this year is up 257%. I seriously dont see how you dont understand this simple logic. You're only down because you bought when it was at its ATH and since then, have done nothing. If you had invested a couple hundred every month for the last several months, you could of turned that into several thousand and would certainly be in the positive. But instead you did the dumb thing and never bought when it was low again. So yes, of course you are still down. My point still stands...
Bitcoin is up 257% since the beginning of this year. Just go ahead and admit that once again, you've missed out on a great buying opportunity and a chance to turn your account that's in the red into an account that could be in the green, just because your pessimism is blocking your brain from seeing the reality of a great opportunity to buy.
@_date: 2019-07-05 03:20:51
The price was 3300 a couple months ago, which I saw as a great opportunity to buy, and now it's currently sitting at 11200, so I've already more than doubled my money. 
I mean what more could you want? Those are MASSIVE gains for only a couple months and yet here you are being so skeptical, despite the FACT that bitcoin is clearly here to stay. 
But hey, scared money dont make none. It's all good bro. Dont buy the dips. That's leaves more for us who believe in what were investing in.
@_date: 2019-07-05 02:44:57
I'll buy one lemonade please for 1000btc. Thanks!��
@_date: 2019-07-05 05:36:18
Just go ahead and sell your bag, which I assume is maybe 50$ worth, if that lol. Take your loss and leave the investing up to the people with a brain.
@_date: 2019-07-10 01:31:56
My goal is at least 1btc
@_date: 2019-07-05 03:58:49
I think we are still in the very early stages of adoption, thus making us the small minority who will see huge returns in the coming years. I believe we are just beginning a bull market again and come next year is when btc and alts will really begin to take off like we've never seen before. But I wholly believe that we will see a new ATH before the next halvening come next may
@_date: 2019-07-05 00:09:47
BUYING THE DIP! THIS IS LIKELY THE LAST CORRECTION BEFORE IT BREAKS 15K IN THE NEXT MONTH, FOLLOWED BY A NEW ALL TIME HIGH. BUY NOW OR REGRET IT LATER.
@_date: 2019-07-05 03:44:44
Hmm..bookmark this post and let me think about it. Sounds like it would be fun
@_date: 2019-07-05 03:24:16
So you bought in around its ATH and because you're still down 40%, you believe that its gonna take till 2024 to reach 15k? What kind of fucked up logic is that? Clearly you're salty that you lost money and as a result, is so pessimistic about bitcoin doing well that when someone predicts bitcoin could reach 100k in the next couple of years, your only response is to laugh? You've yet to actually say anything technical on why you think the price won't reach that high..
@_date: 2019-07-05 00:24:02
If that's true, then damn, a good day trader could make easy thousands if he makes the right calls in the majority of his trades.
@_date: 2019-07-05 17:56:35
Honestly, I dont care what anyone says but just plan on holding long term and I can almost garauntee that BTC is gonna AT LEAST hit it's all time high of 19k before the next halvening next may. So even buying right now is a good buy. 
Nobody can predict where this is gonna go but what we do know is crypto IS THE EVOLUTION of currency, and BTC has proven the naysayers year after year and it's obviously here to stay.  Buy what you can during the dips, try to acquire at least 1 btc, hold for 5 years and you very well could become a millionaire because you chose to ignore the FUD and simply be patient. Believe in your investment. Because if you dont believe in the product your investing in, then what's the point?
@_date: 2019-07-06 01:51:42
I'd love for you to prove your statement regarding ETH.  
And regarding xrp, you can say that all you want but until xrp shows any sign of actually slowing down with its partnerships, then you couldn't be any more wrong. It's all good though, I'll continue turning a profit while you remain a giant pessimist lol
@_date: 2019-07-05 05:39:08
I have no compassion for cognitive dissonance, willful ignorance and just straight up stupidity. Which you demonstrated all three. Go sell your little pity party somewhere else.

Good info and one I will take into heart. Thanks.
@_date: 2019-07-05 03:03:03
Bro, you're clearly in the wrong place here man. Come back when you've done a little more research on just how big bitcoin is gonna be in the coming years and you MIGHT understand that the current price is gonna seem like a freaking bargain compared to what its gonna cost in the future.
@_date: 2019-07-10 01:17:59
Yeah, I wouldn't put a penny in anything other then btc at the moment. Maybe in  a year alts will pick up but right now, it's all btc.
@_date: 2019-07-05 02:43:59
Damn I'm jealous. You're clearly the whale who's been manipulating the price!
@_date: 2019-07-05 00:28:21
Nice call. Risky but clearly it worked in your favor....this time lol.
@_date: 2019-07-05 03:01:27
I honestly dont think he has even the slightest clue regarding BTC and its potential for massive gains, and as a result, he gets all butthurt because I called him out on his clear lack of knowledge on the subject. He laughs at me for my BTC prediction, which could actually be a modest prediction compared to others, and then whines because I respond to his laughing. Kind of ironic dont ya think? Lol
@_date: 2019-07-07 04:52:48
That's rough man. I held all my altcoins and btc and seriously wasnt tripping at all during the bear market. And then I bought as much as I could while it was at 3300 so I can safely say I'm pretty happy with my buying decisions. Not to brag or anything haha
@_date: 2019-07-05 18:20:06
I decided to buy at 7k and have been increasing my bag ever since. 
I think buying at 11k will seem like a bargain 3 years from now.
@_date: 2019-07-05 04:54:29
Do you know how to read basic English? Key word: USUALLY. and that large retracement still saw bitcoin at a price higher then it was 2 years ago(2500). Damn bro, you truly are willfully ignorant Haha. It's kind of sad really. And yet here you are claiming you've looked at the numbers. CLEARLY YOU HAVENT.
@_date: 2019-07-10 02:13:50
I know that's the safest bet, but sometimes there are good opportunities to increase your bag buy selling when it high and buying back in on the correction, which almost always follows. Is it risky? Of course. Is the market unpredictable? Yes. But there is still opportunities to make good profit and use it to buy back in on the lows.
@_date: 2019-07-05 00:22:45
I'm glad I was patient because its corrected quite a bit and I was able to buy under 11k again compared to when it was 12k when I asked this.
@_date: 2019-07-05 01:42:01
Dude, bitcoin hit 13.3k last week.....
We are in the early stages of a crypto bull market again, this time with institutional money and more people knowing about bitcoin and starting to see that BTC is well on it's way to truly becoming the new currency. The bitcoin halvening is happening next May which is gonna cause BTC to moon, breaking its previous ATH of 19k. 
I don't know where you've been getting your news or why you think that btc won't hit 15k for another 5 years(LOL) but many experts believe btc is gonna hit 100k by next year.
@_date: 2019-06-23 21:41:42
Oh I did, but I was in between jobs at the time and could only afford a couple hundred every month.
@_date: 2019-06-04 00:36:51
If you plan on holding long term, does it really matter what price you buy it at, at this point?
@_date: 2019-06-22 20:38:22
Anyone know how long it takes to recieve money to buy again if I sold today? Because the window might be short and if it takes a couple days in order to buy back in, then it obviously wouldnt be worth it
@_date: 2019-06-22 21:13:06
Yeah I'm not gonna take the risk. Just gonna HODL for now. If it jumps up again, I might consider it.
@_date: 2019-06-22 20:20:00
Anyone think it's a good time to sell and buy back in after correction?
@_date: 2019-06-23 21:33:15
Yeah I know what you mean. I wish it stayed around 7k a month and a half ago just so I could stack more. I'm still putting in all I can but it's much easier when its cheaper
@_date: 2019-06-22 21:01:15
It's just a question bro. Lol
@_date: 2019-06-22 20:31:35
It seems to be remaining stable around 10600 so maybe we've hit a new floor
@_date: 2019-06-30 02:46:07
A x3 return is certainly something to celebrate. Figuring as an 8% return on blue chip stocks is considered a good return, can anyone really complain when you have a 300% return?
@_date: 2019-06-22 21:20:52
Yeah, it really is so hard to know when to sell or not. Crypto is just too volatile to really know what's gonna happen. But at the same time, with any large increase, a correction always follows. And figuring btc went up 1300 this week, a correction seems likely. But at the same time, the real FOMO is gonna happen now so it's hard to know when the correction will happen.
@_date: 2019-06-30 11:23:28
I'm guessing 8500-9000
@_date: 2019-06-22 21:06:57
I agree. I'm gonna hold until it reaches 13k or so and MAYBE sell. But its probably safer just to hold and buy any correction
@_date: 2019-06-22 20:25:46
Not really. It's gone up 1300 in the last week. I suspect a correction down to 9500-9800
