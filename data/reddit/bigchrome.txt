It does. That was a thing back then.

I had two sells set at €405 and €420 and they didn't go through..

At the same time it would be great to have had them go through.. Could have made a tidy amount of extra bitcoin in no time. I sent a message to kraken support to see what they have to say.

Cryptonomicon is one hell of a tome. My uncle gave it to me when I was ~14. Thanks for reminding me to go back and re-read it now that it won't all be over my head.
Welcome to the Bitcoin party, times are tough right now for speculators, so much promise for everyone else though!

Just saw this as well. They couldn't suspend trading before many of their users were forced to panic sell, no. Can only do that when the gig is finally up.

Guys have their tags all wrong. It's:
&lt;Gox&gt;&lt;/Gox&gt;Your Bitcoins

Not providing cover for gox to move their coins at all... Whoo whoo.

I see this regularly with my withdrawals from Kraken. 1-2 days at the very most. Often only a few hours.

Kraken Support have told me that they "are looking into the issue," and will let me know what they find. It was not, apparently, an April fools thing.

First "Purchase," ends up actually just giving away your money.
[r/Buttcoin]( would love this.

I'm aware of the problem with the hyper text transfer protocol and our team is working to fix it. We'll update you soonish.

What other forms of payment have you tried paying with that gold is the only one accepted? Pokemon cards? Stale vegetables?

I wrote a program in MATLAB to do this a few years ago. It's written for private keys, and takes a dictionary of homoglphs (two or more characters which look very similar, and could be confused by handwriting, for example) and generates the list of all the substitutions.
I never got around to finishing it fully, nor will it make the guesses for you, but DM me if it sounds like it would be useful to you and I'll dig it up.
Edit: it allows an integer value to indicate your certainty in each character, which speeds things up a lot. It still waterfalls down to do all combinations, just starts with only substitution of uncertain characters.

How the F do you use that ��

I hadn't really been keeping up with crypto since 2014, other than logging in at the start of the recent runup and shorting BTC to lose pretty much all my investment which I had painstakingly 10x'd. Your post just reminded me of Cryptsy and that I had Doge on there. FUUUUUUUUUUU....

I just want a 2019 GTI. Base spec will do as long as it's DSG
