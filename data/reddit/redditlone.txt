That's crazy, yeah I use my debit card too but it's limited to £250. It says the limit is increase after general use. Wish the limit was a bit higher.

The accuracy is uncanny.

Good luck and hodl on my friend

Yeah I'm going to withdraw the funds into a ledger nano s once it arrives, I've never transferred coins before so it'll be a learning process.
@_date: 2017-12-01 09:26:41
Yeah hard times man. I guess its never too late to join the ride!
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:05:34
Thanks, buts it's weird that a transfer I made today straight went through even before the €550 that I made days days ago...
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:56:37
I bought in a few yesterday at £7500 not a full coin though I can't afford that. But hopefully I can build it slowly.

Bitcoin is at a point where it is being referred to digital gold and not a digital currency due to its large price and volatility.
The big rise in price is all due to exposure of bitcoin and cryto and given the timespan, implementation for transactions will need to catch up. 
Basically, what I am saying is that cypto is the future and we are not there yet. Crypto is still growing, and the price we attach to it is where we believe it to be valued at the moment.
Sceptics can say whatever they want, and you don't have to argue them. Everyone has a biased and until they themselves see both sides of the arguement and decide for themselves than go off one point against cryto then they are surely uninformed about cryto.
I probably did a bad job at trying to answer your question but there are lots of arguements against it. Crypto has been largely compared to the http bubble and look where we are now just barely two decades later.

I'm a noob so I did it straight up but I'm learning as I go. But I've read that Coinbase has not been hacked since their inception in 2012, albeit their service is quite shitty.
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:06:34
just started a £500 (£480 - fees) investment into bitcoin around £7500 asking price and looking to buy more into bitcoin soon, trying to get to around 0.1 BTC for now.
I'm a student so I can't afford much more, how is everyone holding up?
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:57:00
Welcome to the club!
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:00:45
Even to go one from this, we need people to spread the awareness of Bitcoin. 
The more people entering the market, the more prevelant it becomes.
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:13:18
Costed me £50

I'm a millionaire... in my dreams

I was just watching the Wolf of Wall Street today. Best Christmas movie ever.
Bitcoin is the Golden Ticket to the Moon.
@_date: 2017-12-01 04:34:23
Sounding call, I'm looking for a full coin too. I'm using Coinbase as a wallet for the moment (literally started today) but a Ledger is coming so I'll be holding onto my funds for the long term there.
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:38:09
Add me to your contacts :D
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:38:11
Prime example of only invest what you can afford.
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:30:11
Yeah I sent it using my correct name but it's still taking forever, I got a reply from support saying it would check out by Monday. Talk about a long wait. Plus the method has a daily limit which really slows everything down...
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:17:38
ITT: The OP becomes even more stupid.
@_date: 2017-12-01 11:35:13
Even more reason too get a physical wallet dude, you got scammed you should prioritise your safety even more.
But that's up to you.
Rethink about it.
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:39:40
Why would you do this to us
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:56:11
If everyone thought the way you did, Bitcoin wouldn't be where it is now.
Profit is one thing, but believing in the technology is another.

They need to get their act together and process my money :/ I sent mine on Sunday which wouldn't be processed until Monday, but only one went through... I am getting impatient
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:04:50
Really depends on what timescale you are using.

Ho ho HODL 
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:13:38
The Revolut method? I started that yesterday, but I just bought £500 directly because I couldn't wait. My funds still haven't been transferred into Coinbase yet and its been 13 hours and counting.
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:31:07
Misinformation 
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:06:59
I sent one today and it went through in just 4 hours. What's going on...
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:59:09
His face is priceless. Just like Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:44:52
Give me.
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:26:44
I've been using Barclays, if it was your first ever purchase then they'll block you. Just call them up and explain your situation and you should be able to process you purchase in the next 5 minutes.
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:36:47
I like your choice of design. Simplistic and elegant

GMT London time?
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:16:01
I topped £200 then £50 then another £50 but the following £50 wasn't accepted due to the daily limit unfortunately.
@_date: 2017-12-01 11:31:47
I'm new to Bitcoin but I've already decided to go with a physical wallet at the end of the day.
As much of a headache as it is, if you're looking to hold BTC you should get over the headache and prioritise the safety of your bitcoins first. 
I don't know much about online wallets but I'm sticking to the safest options provided by the veterans. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:22:51
Agreed. IOU as a gift is a bit cringe. I think the act is nice but the execution is a bit off rail here dude.
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:27:42
Littttt I want a pair
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:42:44
For me it is, I used the details on my debit card for transfers, I wonder if that's the reason.
I'll do some research.
Edit: I realised that I can transfer more in if I do a direct transfer from my bank account, is that what you did using your Revolut account details? (sort code etc.) If you did, how long did it take to transfer? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:13:53
Then how did the first one I made go through fine. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 12:25:55
Glad to be here :) 
@_date: 2017-12-01 12:51:06
And buy it from local vendor? I've been hearing they inflate the prices by adding a premium of up to £300 per coin.
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:25:21
Nice I just started with a fourth of what you have. Want to get more haha
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:24:46
People don't really translate lost in time to lost in money whereas a direct cost in fees will. 
I'm all for positive thinking but this is a semi good analogy .
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:17:00
I want one.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:00:31
Yeah I know, missing out on some good deals
@_date: 2017-12-01 12:31:43
Damn... Well I'm in a deep hole now aren't I.

Mines coming soon and I plan to send straight from coinbase to my ledger
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:28:13
Do what you think you should do instead of following the crowd or hoping for the crowd to follow you. 
The most important thing is to belief that your decision is independently sound and correct for yourself!
Anyway welcome to the BTC family !
@_date: 2017-12-01 11:55:06
Well said. Bitcoin is the future. 
@_date: 2019-06-29 19:03:24

I HODL because I’m no stranger to love.
@_date: 2018-02-15 00:07:52
Shows you how much ShapeShift actually understands the market. How can you make a mistake calling the granddaddy Bitcoin Core... that’s like calling the Dollar something else when trying to do business in the US as a company based internationally.
TL;DR - If you can’t get something simple like a name right in an official announcement, how are you going t gain people’s trust?

@_date: 2019-05-31 22:50:03
This is exactly me, I’m not scared of breaking the device, I’m just not exactly sure if I had the correct seed?
I restarted the device before when I first got it new and put in the seed and it worked fine, bu prior to that, the seed had no crypto in it so I couldn’t really check if it really did work.
So I’m just here not updating the firmware because of this.
