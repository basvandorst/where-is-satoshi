If the person puts BTC on binance then clearly not to sell as binance has no fiat gateways.
It's more likely that the BTC either are getting converted to a different currency or is using an exchange to put the funds on several anonymous wallet addresses so they can't be traced back to silk anymore.

Bitcoin was not popular to protect against devaluation it was popular because it was easy to get as much money out of the country as you could afford (and of cause the get rich quick reason). 
Which in the end is the reason why they started to "ban" Bitcoin. To prevent Chinese money leaving the country.

The company I work for changed from bitpay to a custom solution due to their payment standard. Our acceptance rate doubled since.
Their invoice address looks nice on paper but due to the fact that not every wallet is compatible it causes a lot of confusion and complaints.
On the other hand we never had issues with amount mismatches using bitpay which is one or we have with our new provider.
So if you want to make it easy for yourself (the company) and don't have much knowledge about Bitcoin bitpay is probably a good choice. Nothing to worry about if you ignore the customer complaints about the missing wallet address.

Well, they actually do control the "cyberspace" since many years. 
China has their own internet. VPN are expensive and their IP addresses get blocked regularly as well.
The majority doesn't use VPN.

Whales scalping each other. Liquidate short/long positions.
Whenever you see spikes like this (no matter if up or down) you can bet it was due to the above mentioned reason.
Currently Bitcoin seems to be a play ball for the rich trying to fuck over other rich people. 
@_date: 2018-08-31 03:23:12
You can, but it fails the purpose to hurt bitpay by not using them as long as they force their payment standard on others.
The right way would be to make the vendor aware of this issue so they can confront bitpay or change to another processor.

People said the same about the great firewall. You can't compare china with any democracy because it's not. 
They will do their own "crypto"-thing which will be available for their people and will ban anything else. They will not allow anything they can't control, never because it will be the end of their regime.
As soon as it gets too dangerous or too powerful they'll simply shut it down, easy as that. No way around for the common person.

They can't censor it so there's no way they'll be able to use Bitcoin for their purposes.
They need something that can't be used to get around the government and their regulations.
Maybe the most important part is to avoid that funds can be sent abroad.
They don't really care if it shifts wealth from one class to another within the country. What china fears is that the funds leave the country.
The best way to prevent this is to create something that can only be used within the country and the western world doesn't care about. No manipulation from outside the government. No fear of funds leaving the country. And they will give something to the people and say: "look we hear you but we also want to protect you from the basement western world. This product is superior to anyone else and it's only for Chinese."
And their people will believe it and love it.
As said before the majority (and I don't meant 51% it will be more  like 90-95% ) Chinese people don't know it any better. They have no idea of what is going on outside of China, except what the government tells them. They don't even know what happens or happened in china if it would be negative for the government. 
Probably also the reason why Mao is such a hero within china, but that's a different topic.

Isn't everyone saying all the time "the past is no indicator of what will happen in the future", especially when it comes to Bitcoin I hear this all the time.
And then there is TA where everyone uses the past to predict the future. Because of the same patterns something looks bullish or bearish or whatever. Because in the past it went up or down when we've seen this pattern so it must happen again.
So can we please find an answer? Is the past an indicator for the future or not?

Well most YouTubers based in china probably either are from a western country and migrated to China. Or are privileged. You can't compare those to people that never knew a different system.
Additionally those people most likely have a much better financially background than the common Chinese.
The third point is that those YouTubers use VPN and they probably use 2 or 3 at the same time as they are far from reliable. Their IP's get blocked or shut down regularly or the speed of those is simply dropping so you can't really use it as webpages simply don't load in a timely manner.
And yes most people in china simply don't care what is outside the Chinese version of the internet. They never knew a different system so they don't know the difference. They wouldn't believe anything on those websites anyways and would say everything is a lie and propaganda.
Chinese people get systematically brainwashed since the day they were born.

Wasn't there a time when the government forbid to short specific titles? I recall something like that (at least in Europe) to save the banks during the banking crisis a couple of years ago?
I get the point of shorts, but I still think it's the cancer of trading. 
It's not really needed in the trading world. The price would find its way either way. It's just a tool for manipulation of the rich to make them even richer.

I'd say what people don't like is the dependency on Bitcoin not Bitcoin itself. 
But on the other hand most projects would never be valued as they are without this dependency.

All bills are in Fiat. At one point you have to convert to pay your employees, rent, electricity, supplier, ...
And we talk about big retailers that have a turnover of hundreds of millions / billions per year. 
Edit 2:
I just had a look at the stats of the company I work for. We offer btc as a payment option via a 3rd party custom solution that automatically converts into Fiat.
We received purchases of round about 800million USD in 2018. BTC made 180,000.00 of it via 3100 purchases by 1650 different customers
People are just not really using it so far.
@_date: 2019-02-06 20:08:15
That's the real reason. Only way around this is to use a 3rd party that automatically converts the incoming Bitcoin payment into Fiat.
No big retailer wants or needs Bitcoin at this point. The 1-3% credited card fee is priced into the product anyways. It's not the retailer paying it it's the customer.
The only area where it would make massive sense is the gambling industry as they can get around restrictions by credit card companies and banks e.g. 7995 coded  transactions and/or blacklisted countries.

Hong Kong is not China even though Chinese think differently. You can't compare them.
 It's hard to take away something from someone if it used to be normal. 
Also most hongkong or Taiwanese people don't see themselves as Chinese. They want to be and stay independent.
The mainland Chinese are not even aware of what happened back then. (Except a few that have contacts or family over there)
When have you seen something like this in mainland China?
Mainland however don't know how it is to have all the privileges so they don't miss them and don't fight for them. And they obey and love their government

Hahaha. They just indroduced dictatorship and the Chinese are celebrating and call him the new Mao.
And yes, Mao is a hero for Chinese people... they have no idea about history. (Except what other countries did to them - especially Japan)
Chinese are heavily brain washed they don't want the things you guys want. They want what the government tells them to. And they're happy. And if you're anti government they'll hate you. China is still isolated and the majority of Chinese people never left the country and are confronted with Chinese propaganda for their whole life.
Wrote it a week ago in another thread. China will never allow something they can't control. 
They will indroduce their own shit one day and will tell their people it's superior to all other solution and people will love it and celebrate because they don't know better.
I forgot to mention one thing. Why would China change their mind and allow Bitcoin etc again. There is no Bitcoin lobby or similar in China. There is no independent news outlet that would go for it. There is no alternative political party. No one in china would dare to go against the will of the government. They all fear the consequences.

Will never happen as long as this government structure is like it is and I would say China has a pretty big influence in a global scale, economically and military.
All Chinese people living in China are massivly brainwashed. The government tells them exactly what to think,  what to like or hate, what to do and how to behave. And people listen to it and do exactly the things the government tells them to.
Only exception are privileged, super rich or people that studied or lived abroad.
The day they will take down the great Wall will be the end of the government structure which is in place now.
They run Bitcoin propaganda telling the people that it crashed and everyone lost their money, except Chinese (  because the government stepped in). The government protected everyone.
My future wifes family is literally threatening me to stop dealing with Bitcoin and even if I tell them what is actually happening they don't believe me (how can I know better than the government or the 'news' outlets).
Those are ordinary people that didn't even know what Bitcoin was before the propaganda started.
I don't see crypto coming back to China as they can not control it. They don't care if it will change the world, China lives in their own world. They will do they're own centralized 'crypto (blockchain)' and everyone in China will be happy (because they don't know better).
Crypto and internet is a threat to the central party which is why they got banned and why they won't get unbanned as long as the political system is in place.

China will always ban everything which could result in a loss of power/control. 
They won't give a fuck abiut those countries if it endagers their control over their people or financial system.
They will indroduce their own thing which will be centralized and massively adopted in China. Then they will tell the people that their product is far superior over other foreign solutions and all Chinese people will be happy, believe them and will do what the government tells them to.
No one will question  the government and the majority has no chance to compare by themselves anyways.

They are. And you don't miss what you don't know.
The 'one China' case is really a sensitive topic. My fiance literally freaks out every time when we come close to this topic. Her family would probably kill me if they could understand me :D
Their understanding about what happened, especially regarding Tibet is really grotesque. 
Other dark topics like the Tiananmen Square massacre are completely unknown. There was an article in a newsapp not long ago and she asked me what it is about. I've showed her pictures and YouTube videos as well as articles from back then. She never heard of it. She asked her family and they didn't hear of it either. She then said it's not true otherwise they would know. It's made up by the western world to make China look bad because the western wwirld, especially  the USA  is  jealous of China. 
Afterwards I didn't wonder anymore why she mentiones Hitler to annoy and make fun of me (I'm German) but adores Mao...
What is really funny: she lives abroad for 2 years now and has full access to the internet and everything, but she still only uses her Chinese apps, as if she's afraid of the 'real' internet. Once I asked her why she doesn't simply Google it and she said she doesn't believe it. Those websites are all lying and will brain wash her... (It got better though)

You guys don't know what's going on in china, do you?
It's not about investment in the first place, it's about getting their money out of china. 
In some countries you can even get a permanent resident visa if you invest a specific amount in projects which then gives them the chance to go and stay overseas with all the advantages that come with it, like getting easy access to a foreign bank account which then gives them easy access to western fiat.
Bitcoin is currently the only way to do this if you don't own a company because china limits the amount you can get our if the country to currently US$50k annually I believe. 
And that's also the reason why china tries to ban Bitcoin. Because they can not control the money flow and fear that people get their funds out of the country. The Chinese debts are close to collapse. They need to keep the funds inside the country.

You usually let your bank know a day earlier or so and they'll organize you the amount you need or send you to the branch that has a vault for purposes like this.
Many branches don't have the facilities to hold huge amounts of cash for security reasons and also need to keep a minimum of cash for other customers. 
It's not like you wake up and feel like oh I'm gonna cash out 10k + for shopping.

A bonus will always come with some sort of wagering requirements. Most online Casinos have it set to 30-60 times the bonus amount. Some even include the deposited amount into the WR.
Usually no withdrawals until the WR are met, some have special rules which will forfeit bonus or a percentage of your winnings if you want to withdraw(depends on the casino).
Never used a Bitcoin casino but I'm sure the rules are similar. 
Anything else wouldn't make sense from the casinos perspective. Too many bonus hunter and promo abuser out there.

If you want to convert fiat I to Bitcoin you could either:
1. Play safe and still buy Bitcoin. If you see it as a long term investment the current price doesn't really matter, just do DCA. Might go up further, might go down again no one knows.
2. Gamble and put your money into any "legit" altcoin that didn't move much in fiat due to btc rising. Wait for a possible alt season (but be prepared that it might not happen or your choice was not one of the lucky pumps) and convert to btc once the alt / btc ratio plays out to be good again. Might end up cheaper than buying Bitcoin now but remember it's a risky gamble.
3. Don't do any of this and put your money into a savings account, spend it on useless thing or blow it on coke and hookers 
Good luck with whatever you're doing in the end.
