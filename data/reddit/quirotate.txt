Any plans to release an iOS version?
@_date: 2018-01-29 20:16:12
Don’t worry. If you ever release it for iOS, I’ll be happy to use it and pay for it because these efforts need to be rewarded.

So what’s the safest option to cash out? Say you have to move something like 100k-300k and cash out without having to worry about the company having enough or simply freezing the process.

Aren’t GDAX and Coinbase basically the same company?

And 1 BTC = 1 BTC always. It’s the most stable coin you’ll find.
@_date: 2017-12-04 09:34:04
This. You can’t call it a crash if it goes up again and starts climbing even higher in a couple of days or even weeks, just like BTC does every single time so far (well, maybe that time it tanked back to $400 was a bit of a crash, but look at it now).
A real crash drastically drops the value and makes it stay there for a long time, so the asset has to work hard to go up again. 
People calling a small drop a crash, knowing that BTC will be up again, somehow managing to magically triple its value in a week sound like that annoying classmate claiming they failed every single test to end up having all A’s and a couple of A+’s. A real crash is when you’re a B- student and suddenly you land a F in a subject you thought you had under control.
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:36:39
True. It’s like having a certain project going on and never finishing it because it could always be improved. There has to be a point where you are satisfied with the results. That’s why I set myself a series of milestones when it comes to crypto. From moderate success to early retirement, but if you’re in  “for as much as possible”, chances are you’ll go too far a hit a point where something big happens, there’s some kind of mass regulation (bound to happen at some point) and your profit gets a severe cut, or either you’ll never consider you have enough.
@_date: 2019-07-12 15:59:09
Look at that. The need to be constantly defending Bitcoin from people who consider crypto a scam as well as LN haters and others who want BTC replaced by other options has rendered you completely unable to differentiate between a genuine attack and an honest, simple joke without the slightest intention to harm.
Either that or you simply don’t have a sense of humour.
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:42:07
For me it’s becoming more like “I don’t know shit about that so I’ll just give you $500 and you invest them for me, ok?”. That’s when I say “No. I don’t want to be responsible for your money or have you asking me how much did you make every 3 days”.
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:40:54
I think that’s the case. I can’t think of anyone having “only” 40BTC and spending most of it on a lambo.

You don’t know if LN works because it’s not implemented yet.

Wow... here in Spain it’s like any other investment, so it’s something around 24% of the profits. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 10:12:12
I’d say the first rule is “Never invest what you’re not ready to lose”. It’s always been like that.
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:25:56
Totally agreed. The moment Bitcoin started being something other than a curious experiment, people from private companies, governments and high spheres have been around trying to manipulate the market in their advantage and probably laying the foundation for a future attempt to destroy it if things get a little out of hand. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 09:19:28
The problem comes when we start adding the “thousands”. Would you call it a crash if it went from $11 to $8? Cause that’s exactly what happened. That’s just a small correction after a big pump. Totally normal.
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:10:51
At last!! Finally someone doing the right thing!!

Obviously I haven't driven any of them. I'm just repeating what I've read and seen in tests. I didn't even expect this conversation to last this long because each one has their own preferences.

Yeah... keep saying that.
@_date: 2017-08-19 08:17:36
I'm going to say you weren't around a month ago when BTC went from $2,900 to $1,900 in a few weeks making every single alt tank hard. This is just a small correction. BTC basically doubled its price in a couple of weeks. We haven't seen the dip yet.
@_date: 2017-08-27 00:01:50

Wow! Thanks!!
@_date: 2017-08-20 23:01:26
Then you're going to love it when it goes back to $3,400 in a few weeks.

I really hope so. I've been waiting for the real dip.
@_date: 2017-08-21 18:34:31
Good to know
@_date: 2019-08-01 06:59:48
Apart from the fact that I don’t like the term “alts” because not even half of them are “Bitcoin alternatives”, since they’re their own project and they’re not trying to compete directly with Bitcoin (so they can coexist), that’s one of the most reasonable visions on the matter I’ve seen on this sub.
@_date: 2019-08-01 10:31:11
Are you seriously implying that, since I can’t predict the future and I don’t know which specific projects will rise, my claim that SOME projects will in fact survive and coexist along with Bitcoin is automatically false?
@_date: 2017-08-21 09:43:29
Yes, and less expensive, with better handling, better aerodynamics, less weight, more equipment and without that stupid water tank in the boot because they couldn't find a better way to cool the engine.
But anyway, to each their own.
@_date: 2019-08-01 06:51:50
That’s like saying there’s no other useful and profitable website besides Google. And it’s so fundamentally absurd that I can’t understand how some people still don’t get it.
If you just want to hold BTC that’s fine. But pretending that years from now, no other crypto project will be perfectly alive, strong and used on a daily basis, that’s just delusional. And no. It won’t only be LTC as a silver to BTC’s gold.
@_date: 2019-06-30 00:53:01
I bet they still think the same. They just have to say “ok, it’s going up but it’s still highly unstable and it will eventually go down”.
@_date: 2019-06-27 22:42:27
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:14:30
And after being here for months since it was $1,800, after buying the equivalent of a full coin just to spend it on alts while it grew and grew, after having around 0.4BTC in my wallet supposedly to hold to end up spending it again, now that owning a full coin means spending a serious amount of money, I just bought the first 0.01BTC that I won’t sell in several years. The goal is to have something around 0.1 and 0.5BTC. Let’s see how that goes. Hopefully something will happen and it will tank hard for a couple of days for some stupid reason only to raise spectacularly again and I’ll take advantage to buy some more.
@_date: 2017-11-25 12:20:04
I used to buy a few things here and there to spoil me every year. Mostly tech stuff and things like that. I could spend around $100-300 every few months but now all that money goes to crypto without hesitation. Spending money in general now feels totally different. A couple of years ago I’d be happy to have something around $1,000 to spend on a new laptop. Now it feels crazy to spend that amount on something that’s not going to grow overtime. Maybe and only maybe something I could use to mine more coins. But only maybe.
@_date: 2018-03-20 09:54:46
Well, I suppose if I was in the thousands of BTC, 40 wouldn’t seem like much. Those 40 have been very close to a full million these past months though. That’s got to hurt a bit. But then again, if he still has a few thousand left...
@_date: 2018-03-02 06:35:02

Am I the only one who read all that with a pinch of "double entendre"?
@_date: 2017-09-02 00:27:03
I don't have much to invest. BTC for me is a store of value, but I don't have that value yet. It can go up another $2,000 and it's an increase of less than 50%. That's why I'm using alts with enough room to grow 10x or even 100x in 2-3 years to make money, then move a big chunk of that to BTC.
@_date: 2017-09-13 18:21:20
I really hope it tanks hard. Don't think so, but one can hope. I'd love to buy more at the now ridiculous price of $2,000 something. And I could've done it just 2 months ago, but I was busy buying alts. Seriously. When you're really following the "don't spend more than it's ok to lose" rule, this market is so much fun!
@_date: 2017-09-02 08:49:20
Yes. No. Maybe. Who knows.
I mean, this is crypto. Don't act like it was "clearly not enough time" because it was last time BTC made a big correction after going from $1,800 to near $3,000 around 3 months ago. It crashed back to around $2,000 in about a month taking most alts down with it.
This time? Well, it was not enough. I still think it will go down eventually and stabilise at some point, but then again, it made a huge jump around March-April and didn't go below $1,800.
So yes, this market is highly volatile and you have to be careful about big dips, but if you're here for the long run, the moment to invest is now.
@_date: 2017-09-19 06:46:12
@_date: 2017-09-14 09:33:47
Yes, but even it it goes back to $2,500, that's still more than +150% compared to the end of 2016. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 07:41:59
Really?? After all this time we still need this kind of encouragement to prevent weak hands??
IMHO anyone who even considers selling during a tiny little dip like this one deserves to lose their money. BTC is still near $4,000 and that's insanely high compared to its price just 9 months ago. Other coins like IOTA have barely lost anything. ARK is at an ATH. A real dip cuts BTC in half and tanks almost all alts with it. This is just a small correction. What are we going to leave for the next real dip?? 
@_date: 2017-09-05 08:39:15
It got to $3,900 a few hours ago and it has a clear tendency to keep tanking man, but whatever you say. If it makes you feel better to think that you were right, then have it your way. I'm not trying to bash BTC or anything. I'm actually using the dip to buy more.
@_date: 2017-09-04 12:06:05
Check again...
@_date: 2017-09-01 14:40:35
I've been waiting since Aug 1st for the "obvious" and "inevitable" correction that would pull back all alts with it to buy BTC and a few others, but it's been a month and it's still going up, so I just said "fuck it" and bought some IOTAs a few days ago. If it goes up, great. I caught it on time. If it goes back down and tanks hard, I'll be ready to buy more.
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:29:35
Not the deepest, but I’ve been buying while it went down. Feels good.
That being said, I wouldn’t be surprised if this was a bull trap. If it is, I’m buying more when it goes even deeper.
@_date: 2018-02-19 13:44:02
Money he used to buy more crypto.

Nobody knows what's going to happen. We're playing with fake made up digital money, remember?
@_date: 2017-06-23 23:49:54
Excuse me, but you pay much more than taxes on Facebook. You're constantly feeding them detailed info about all aspects of your life. Info that they later sell to companies wanting to target a very specific audience. You can't put a price to that, but Facebook sure does.
Let's put our tinfoil hats on for a minute. What's really happening here? Are the great powers of the world really letting us create our own economy apart from them, not paying any taxes and becoming much wealthier than we're supposed to be without even moving a finger? Of course not, but they need to test the waters of the 21st century economy. We're the testers. We're guinea pigs in this experiment. Yes, we're given our reward. Just like pioneers colonizing the US were given free land, we're being offered the option to become wealthier or even rich if we play our cards right. It's the ultimate goal of the game. In the meantime, we test new options, new algorithms, new solutions, new combinations, new security measures... When cryptocurrencies really get to a point where they've solved all scalability and usability problems, they'll find a way to infiltrate and take control. And we'll probably be blind to that part of the process thinking about our profits.
They don't really care about a few thousands having a little more money than usual and a few hundreds being moderately rich. They'll probably make their move right before the real mass adoption, when all cryptos are much more stable so they can still control the big masses that will be too lost and confused trying to adapt to this new digital money.
Anyone who thinks we're giving a big middle finger to the great powers of the world, is very very wrong.

First we had standard video games, after that, smartphone games came and most of them included (and still do) rewarding systems to improve characters or unlock new levels. We've getting used to in-game currencies for a few years now, so handling virtual coins is a normal thing for us. Even buying more coins with fiat is something you can do in games. Unknowingly, we were training to use crypto currencies in real life.

I started mining back between 2010 and 2011. I think I got near 1BTC and got bored. Got back when it was around $200 and thought it couldn't last much longer. It had to crash soon. I started again just a week ago when it went down to $1900 and actually got like $500 worth of it at that price, but spent it on other altcoins. It's taken 7 years and many facepalms but now I know I'll always have as much BTC as I can. And if it goes down again, I'll just buy more.
And that's it ladies and gentlemen. Since I'm really taking this seriously now, BTC will crash in just a few days.
@_date: 2017-06-27 19:09:01
That happens a lot in moments like this last month. Many of us finally decided to invest because we saw what happened in March. Even when we knew about Bitcoin since 2009/2010. For me it was the time. I couldn't before. I can now. But of course I wasn't expecting another March in June. Specially when you begin to know a bit more about this market. I just want to start investing and be there for the next moment when things start rising like crazy, because if I wait for the perfect time to start, I'll probably miss it anyway. I think many others started trading thinking this was like March all the time. People getting 20x their initial investment in days without a single dip. And many of them are dropping the ball now thinking this is all a scam or that crypto was a way to make lots of money a couple of years ago but not anymore. Blaming their luck for starting when the bubble was about to pop.
I'm not 100% sure, but I want to believe with patience, research and a little more every month, I'll look back 3-4 years from now and think this was a good idea. Maybe we can get back to this post when BTC gets to those $10,000.
@_date: 2017-06-05 14:02:14
Yep... I remember when mining was easy and you could actually get full bitcoins in a relatively small amount of time, or when it was so cheap you could easily buy several thousands. Imagine having like 2,000 BTC today.

Well sir, from one of the new recruits (14 days) I have nothing but respect for you. Well done. You deserve every single one of your coins and more.
Like most people these days, I come here in times of peace because everything's fine, almost all major coins are going up and you can see it just looking back a single month. That's why I know I'll probably have some stories to tell in a few years. That is, if my balls contain a small portion of the same titanium yours are made of.
