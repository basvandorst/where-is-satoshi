No, but I can sell for USD and transfer that out of my Robinhood account. Or invest in other entities

Entry point only matters if you're a trader, and 99% of traders lose money

Yes, it would. It's natural to feel regret when you miss on short term gains; shifting your focus to the long term is the hardest part about becoming experienced in this area. I still haven't even mastered it myself. Think about it this way: the circulating supply of Bitcoin is limited. There are just under 18M coins out there and experts estimate that a good 2-3M are lost to the void. Which leaves 15-16M coins available. If you own more than one full Bitcoin, you are in the minority, and you'll likely be doing very well a decade or two down the line.

Bull market is coming for sure, but this is the tail end of the bear market. I personally don't expect to see a moonshot just yet. This new hype will get people talking and starting to think about it, though. Looks like a break below 7900 could cause it to breakdown, how much and for how long is beyond me.

This is the latest in a long line of lessons haha. I still shed a tear when I scroll back to my 2014 Coinbase history and see a purchase of 2btc for about $1000... that I used on deepweb shopping

If you don't know the difference between "bear market" and "correction," you should study up more before investing your money
