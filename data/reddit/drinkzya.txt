Wrong. I was rocking ELI5 long before bitcoin. I remember trying to buy bitcoin with paypal when I first started and many of the methods I first used I paid a heavy premium on. (Granted I still made money in the end) 
Coinbase.com or circle.com as another user mentioned is probably your best bet.

I borrow 1000 USD. USD splits, you're saying I am then liable to pay back the 1000 USD + 1000 NewUSD? That doesn't really seem fair

The point of this post was about customer service. Maybe you shouldn't be so quick to think you have an answer.
