OP's name even alludes to being a marketer.
I do like how he's posted to and in his vast 23 days of redditing. That really helps solidify the legitimacy of the account.

If you HDD failed, it's likely the arm inside. The disks still have the data. Google fixes for it. You can probably do it yourself, but you would be risking it if you botch it. Either way, wouldn't hurt to read up on.

I didn't say it was correct, I just said it's an accepted shorthand.
Wouldn't be the first thing finance guys fucked up, now would it?

MM is an accepted shorthand for million.
The roman numeral M = 1000. 1000x1000 = 1,000,000

That is incredibly awesome. A little fishing boat like that seems like it'd be the difference between struggling and thriving in a little fishing village.
Excellent idea and good on you for helping see it through!

I've done this twice to buy vehicles. They only needed one business day heads up in both cases. If you just walk in, no, giving that much with no notice messes up their estimated cash flow.

Good for you for doing whatever it is you do so well, but your comment would hold more weight if you weren't such a condescending dick wrinkle. Small wonder you "got your nose smashed in". 
~~As it is, you sound more like a troll furiously pecking away at his mechanical keyboard in his step-father's basement.~~
edit: From reading your other comments, I take that back. You do sound like you could be truthful. However, I think you summed it up best yourself:


I think I'd rather be a "mope" with real friends and family than be forced to live amongst a bunch of condescending and judgmental asshats. But hey, to each their own. You have fun with that derision thing, seems to be working out for you.

This is true, but you can mitigate that by giving them to people you know might be interested or are on the fence instead of just giving them out to everyone. I've already had conversations with many people, but few have jumped in. Giving to the ones that have expressed any interest is where this would be successful.
I was also thinking of including info of how to use gyft.com, which would make the wallet either a starting point or a universal gift card. I feel there would be value in demonstrating that real things can be purchased with small amounts of btc.

My credit union not only reimburses atm fees, they give back the profits to account holders. Last year I got almost $450 deposited as my share.

If you read the article, you'll see that she already got the funds to him using another foundation as a middleman.

So, wanting to keep more of my earnings is selfish/greedy, but someone else wanting my earnings is not selfish/greedy? 
Don't fool yourself. Regulations exist because the entrenched big businesses paid for them with lobbying. They serve merely as barriers to competition and sources of revenue. You're delusional if you think banking regulations prevent any sort of violent crime.

...are you insinuating that a plethora of financial regulations are necessary because they prevent sexual slavery?

There are different types of people, even amongst the homeless. You've got people struggling with drug/alcohol/mental problems, you've got down on their luck people, you've got young guys that just turned to a roamer lifestyle for whatever reason, you've got theatrical types busking/panhandling, you've got plenty of individuals that don't fit any of these stereotypes either.
I mean, this article is definitely slightly sensationalized and being used to further a point, but I can still see how a few people might actually be homeless and benefiting from bitcoin.
