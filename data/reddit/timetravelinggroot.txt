But, what does that have to do with Coinbase having one price on their dashboard, and one price on their buy/sell page?  The buy/sell price is consistently higher than the price they show on the main dashboard.  This is all on Coinbase for Bitcoin.

On Coinbase, the price on the Dashboard is different than the price when you go to buy or sell.  For example, when I look at the price on the Coinbase dashboard it says 6053, but when I go to buy/sell it says 6093.  It still says 6053 when I go back to the dashboard, it doesn't change on the dashboard when I click back and forth.

I'm wondering if it'll drop dramatically after the holidays like it did in 2016. It steadily grew up to around Christmas, and then dropped dramatically in January only to steadily rise again.

Anyone have any estimates on when the next dip is coming?

Thanks for the explanation!

It might be a stretch to say that bitcoin is used for savings by *most* people in the US and Europe. As GreatWork123 points out, banks have a low interest rate which kind of sucks, but what he didn't say is that the good thing about banks is that your money is insured.  The bigger the reward, the bigger the risk, so definitely put money in bitcoin, but not more than you are willing to lose. Have some money in savings, some money spread between stocks, bonds, and ETF's, some money in real estate, etc. Basically, diversify, don't put all of your eggs in one basket.

Did you mean to respond to me or another user?

The FDIC insures your money for up to $250,000. It may be simplistic to say the *banks* insure your money, but the point I was making is that the money is insured.

But, doesn't it still need to scale to keep fees low? Isn't the reason the fork was occuring is that there an issue that needs to be resolved that still isn't resolved?

Thanks, this is what I was looking for.

Well, aside from believing in them, have there been any concrete solutions proposed?
