Wow, honestly you need to learn some basic math.
Its pretty simple. The chances of getting tails 20/20 times (the only way you would lose the bet)
are as follows:
Chances of hitting tails is 1/2 or 0.5. There is 20 tosses.
To find out the probability of it landing tails everytime we just take 0.5 to the power of 20 or (0.5)^20 which equals 0.000000953674 or 0.000095%.
So the chances of you winning the bet would be 99.999905%, which is slightly less then 100% if you didnt know.

Ive been using coinberry a lot. No issues at all after verifying account and initial 72 hr wait for withdrawal. OP is just impatient it seems.
@_date: 2019-07-10 17:56:34
Lots of exchanges you can setup automated recurring purchases.
Coinbase is one of them, Coinberry is good for Canadians.
You will most likely have to manually send the coins to an external address, but the DCA can easily be done.

Unfortunately the fees will only increase until a scaling solution has been found. I suggest giving this a read
 
My suggestion would be to just hold it in your wallet until lightning network is live (Could be months,years) or buy a much larger stake before you send it out. It is not a percentage based fee, but a fee per transaction.
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:50:30
If you buy bitcoin , do not try to send it anywhere. It costs upwards of 50$ just to make a transaction.
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:42:23
Man, you should not be trading with leverage. Bitcoin is volatile enough as it is.

@_date: 2019-08-08 02:33:18


This is correct, and you would be able to verify it is **NOT** the address you are intending to send to and not finish the transaction. 
Here is a video showing how a hardware wallet will mitigate this attack compared to a software wallet that was posted a few days ago.

Not really, since in order to get paid in fiat, mt.gox would have to sell assets to pay creditors. Better chance someone paid in btc would hodl. Someone paid in fiat has already had the btc sold.

You entered your seed words onto a phishing website. The trezor itself is still safe. **NEVER ENTER YOUR SEED WORDS INTO A WEBSITE**
Recover your seed directly on the device itself, and check your balances a blockchain explorer.
@_date: 2018-06-26 05:05:16
Doesnt matter if they get fiat or btc, they only get the USD value of the bitcoin they owned @ 2014 prices (300-400$) So if they you had 1 BTC hacked in mt.gox, you would recieve 0.05 BTC lol. 
@_date: 2019-02-05 06:54:09
I bought and withdrew BTC many times from Qcx and never had an issue. The last time I made a purchase of BTC and a successful withdrawal (took a few minutes like always) was the first week of December 2018, so about 60 days ago roughly.
The issues with Qcx was with Fiat Withdrawals, and yes I would not conisder them trustworthy in this regard. They have had issues paying fiat withdrawals since the beginning of 2018.

Telling people in a public forum that you have held BTC for 7+ years is not a very good idea.

Good chance you will receive PM's from people trying to scam you. 
Best thing to do is just buy a new one, set it up in private, and destroy the old one if you are unsure of what you are doing. Dont take any chances with a compromised device.
Their should be a way to set it up the existing one with a new seed, but make sure your seed is random and secure. (dont think of the words yourself)
You need to keep your Seed Words and PIN secret. If someone knows your seedwords they will be able to access your funds remotely from another wallet. If someone knows your PIN they will have to have physical access to your device to move your funds.

Liquidate everything to BTC, send it to an exchange that deals in your home currency (Gemini, GDAX) and you will be able to transfer it into a bank account. It will take a few weeks to verify your account on an exchange that deals with Fiat Currencies (USD,EUR).
If you have access to the screen you took the photo of, then you have access to the funds, find a trust worthy individual to help guide you through it.

If this is not bullshit, and you actually had 10 bitcoins from 2016, you will also have the forked bitcoin cash tokens. Get someone trustworthy to help you get your 10 BCH, it is worth a good 10K USD.

You realize that people have been calling this a bubble since the very very start.
Here is a post from May 2011 from someone named Ross Ulbricht (aka Dread Pirate Roberts) 
Bitcoin was under 10$ then, what makes you think that it has topped out? Do you not think it is possible for it to grow even larger? What makes you so sure it will blow up into non-existance other then the fact you have no skin in the game?
@_date: 2018-04-19 16:49:29

I hear theres a good chance of it going towards the right of the chart.
@_date: 2018-04-27 06:38:42
Why are big blocks better? Your argument has no substance. Also repeating the same satoshi's vision, whitepaper whatever is getting old. Consensus makes BTC, not the whitepaper. BCH is BCH, BTC is BTC. I am a neutral party, I have no issues with BCH as a coin, I do however have issues with the marketing tactics, mining cetralization and propoganda surrounding it.

I agree that the price got ahead of itself due to the greed of people only buying to get rich, with absolutely no care what it is, other then that they could make money. If you bought during the hype in december, or back in december 2013 for that matter (Last time price got ahead of itself) then you probably lost a bunch of money. Those 2 episodes can be considered bubbles, but bitcoin as a whole from inception to present day is not.

Your straight up gambling if your doing leveraged trades. This is in no way an investment. There is a very high chance you will make a bad trade and get rekt. It isn't a lot, but it is stupid. Your better off increasing your position to 5-10k and using no leverage. Liquidation is not a pleasant outcome.

You send them to your deposit address on your kraken account. After you set up an account it will have a deposit address to send BTC and you can send your coins from coinbase to it. It should have deposit addresses for ETH and LTC aswell.

Why do you care so much? You realize institutional investors are just starting to get there toes wet in this. Do you think these multi-million dollar entities are going to invest their clients hard-earned money into something that is "a dog with fleas", or maybe there is something to this that they see that you do not. 
Hedge funds, etfs, all kinds of new money coming in. Bitcoin is what it is supposed to be, a trustless form of P2P exchange. Its "price" means little to what its purpose is. 
@_date: 2018-04-03 23:40:41
I could honestly care less about valuations or projections. I already have a well rounded portfolio of equitys, bonds, and precious metals. I received a good portion of my BTC from donations from my website, I purchased small bits bi-weekly throughout last year, because I like the idea of bitcoin, its ideology and the technology behind it. I get it, people who buy at ATH thinking of lambos are retarded at best, but that doesnt mean that the network or utility in bitcoin is of no value. I think it is overvalued now at the current moment in time, but too think it will just collapse and go to zero is just as nieve as the people thinking it would keep going from 20k to 100k.
