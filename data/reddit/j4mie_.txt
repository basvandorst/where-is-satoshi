I like price posts, they're part of the excitement

wrong paraphrase, my bad
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:24:26
Good explanation!

Less than 100M seems like a good stimation. According to internet live stats there are [3.7B internet users]( so that would mean that less than 1.28% of all internet users have bitcoin.
Shouldn't we still be in innovators phase then?

Congrats and welcome 2 the club!

What's this supposed to mean? I thought BTU was just the forerunner of BCH?

Did this person use a bitcoin mixer? I see a lot of small transactions on the address where the 37 BTC came from.

From $12,800 to $13,600 in 10 minutes on Bitstamp right now, just after I had read this :P

There are multiple ways, but I'd do this:
1. Install a light wallet like Electrum 
2. Search for a bitcoin exchange to buy bitcoin
Also try to learn how bitcoin works by reading on sites like

How does this price get determined while B2X isn't live yet?
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:29:15

It's gonna happen.

nice :P

I did it this way:
1. Send your BTC to a new address, so that your BTC and BCH aren't on the same address. Just to be safe.
2. Export the 'old' private key(s)
3. Install [Electron Cash](
4. Import the private key(s) from step 2 into Electron Cash
5. Convert your BCH to BTC using a site like [ShapeShift]( There are probably more sites like this but I don't know any of them

I meant a protocol hack, exchange hacks are different from bitcoin's security itself


Yea that's an example of a protocol hack. A 51% attack surely is a risk, but if it happens then it will get noticed so fast by the other miners that the damage remains limited I think. Maybe other miners then start temporarily blocking certain IP addresses or so.
@_date: 2017-10-29 15:58:40
Did you already check whether your addresses still contain your BTC? 
If your addresses still contain your BTC and if you're able to obtain your private keys using dumpprivkey then you're safe.
@_date: 2017-10-31 22:19:31
Then I'll be buying as many BTC as I can :P
I don't think it would have a big impact in the long term. The only thing that could make bitcoin crash would be a sort of hack on the protocol where bitcoins get lost or something like that IMO.
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:05:51
hahaa I saw it :P
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:04:42
Boom. $6000
