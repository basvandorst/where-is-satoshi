I use "keyring" to describe bitcoin wallets. It seems appropriate, and most people get the concept.

Odd indeed. As long as you control the private key these physical coins are just a novelty. No reason for them to exist.

You could download bitaddress.org from git and run it from [tails]( and roll dice/shuffle cards to create your paper wallets.
Have you investigated [Armory]( or [Electrum's]( cold storage features?

Bitcoin is cash. If a criminal robs you of whatever cash $ you may have it's most likely gone forever. So, I guess if you never have cash $ on hand you have nothing to worry about.
The problem is what if your bank where you keep your money decides to rob you. What is your recourse then?

I'll poke around and see if I can figure out what the problem might be. It seems something has changed since I installed Electrum.

You can disreguard installing python-trezor if you are not using a Trezor

Nice try.

Try this to overcome the "cannot find -ludev" error:
sudo apt-get install libudev-dev

My guess is AML and KYC regulatory compliance.
They are a BTC/fiat gateway, God forbid people use their money how they see fit.

What stops the value of stocks and bonds from dropping 25% in two months for no apparent reason?

Edit setup.py by adding the line in **bold** fixed this error in my tests.
 
import platform  
import imp
**i18n = imp.load_source('i18n', 'lib/i18n.py')**  
version = imp.load_source('version', 'lib/version.py')  
util = imp.load_source('util', 'lib/util.py')

I've been using coinbase for almost 2 years with little issue. That being said, I never keep more than a petty amount in my coinbase wallet at any given time.
I would encourage you to investigate [Armory]( [Electrum]( [Trezor]( and [encrypted paper wallers]( and judge for yourself which is appropriate for your situation.

I'm constantly amazed that people like this find their way into positions of power and influence.

I recevied a call today from my bank that said my debit card would be cancelled (most likely due to Home Depot data breach) and I would receive a new card in 7 to 10 business days.
That is all well and good, except my wife received that same call two weeks ago and has not yet received her new debit card.

Thank you for your response. It carries as much weight as his did.

WTF does this mean?
@_date: 2016-03-21 02:22:02


Would you explain what you mean by this, please?

This video will give you some insight.

I originally rejected Bitcoin also. Then six months or a year later it came back into my radar scope, this was the result:
