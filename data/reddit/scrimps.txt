Still has not been resolved. Sent an e-mail.

Thanks. So far I have heard three different things. I am just worried if I say I am paying a Bill, that it won't work. Or if I say I am paying a business it won't work also, since I am not sure what the right thing is. 
Is what you say simply so they take your money? Or is it letting them know they have to do something special when it comes to your deposit.

Thanks. 
That is strange though. I thought it worked that way, but the tutorial they show on their website shows them converting the money into bitcoins then placing them in a wallet you point it towards.

Yup. Nothingg yet. Contacted support. They told me no such thing ever happened. 
Contacted support again. They said they needed the Quote ID and Even ID. I gave it to them. Then they said it worked fine. Which it didn't, that was a cash transaction that happened the day after.
They then said they needed the Quote ID of the cash transfer. I didn't have it, but I took a photo of the receipt and sent them the zipzap PDF. Have not heard anything since then. 
I then contacted the service they use for the bank transfer and was sent an e-mail stating I never made such a transaction. Even though I have evidence on my bank account,and a screenshot of the bitinstant receipt with all the ID numbers I need. 
Oh well.

I called up Bitinstant, they said it should not take that long. Then told me to e-mail support. I e-mailed support. Got a mail back today saying they have no transactions associated with the e-mail i sent them. Even though the money has been taken from my bank, AND I have a screenshot of the receipt page.

It was resolved, but it took a while. The person at customer support kept asking for information. Kept telling me the bank transfer went through and the cash didn't. 
She then escalated it to the company that deals with the bank stuff. They had it fixed within 30 minutes. Dunno why it was not escalated right away, but it all worked out in the end.

Have you used Bitinstant to do something similar?
