Awesome! I think I feel comfortable enough to try it now. Thanks a lot for helping out. Will report back if I encounter any problems!

thank you!!

True. But I just read in another thread that the hearing is supposed to go good with a source. It could go bad that's why we're only doing a little bit of money right now.

Oh I might do this. Cause I don't necessarily *need* the coin tomorrow. Just to make the purchase before the hearing. Because lets say I buy 1BTC for $100 tomorrow. I receive it in a week and now 1BTC is worth $1000. Do I now have 1BTC worth $1000 or .1BTC worth $100?

thank you!!

There's a lot of guys selling in my area. How exactly does it work? Do I meet up with them and give them cash? Or do I have to do it through banks? Because on each person they list a different "cash deposit" bank they use. Sorry for all the questions still trying to learn a lot.

Yes. This is what i'm talking about! Thank you. So I should be good to buy through coinbase today?

I'm from America. I assumed I could.. Can I?
@_date: 2013-11-18 05:35:14
Okay! Where and how do I do that? 
@_date: 2013-11-18 05:07:07
Hmmm. Say I buy $200 worth today. In a week when I receive them are they going to be worth the amount of bitcoin I bought it with originally? Or when I recieve them do I get them at the current market price? I hope I worded that correctly.

Awesome. Thanks! I feel dumb asking this but i'm confused - When using coinbase it's asking to verify with a bank. So am I going to have to buy these a special way other than just say a credit card?
@_date: 2013-11-18 05:45:16
Okay awesome I have that set up. So basically every time I want to login I open that app and I enter the numbers it gives me before time runs out?

can you see my reply to neofatalist below and confirm if what i'm saying is correct?
@_date: 2013-11-18 04:54:42
Any idea of what time the hearing is? Can I use credit unions? Because that's what I use otherwise my dad would have to do it with his bank which i'm not sure he'll be able to do.

I think i'm going to go with coinbase right now. But in the future i'll definitely use those tips. Thanks a lot!
@_date: 2013-11-18 05:25:12
Okay I'll do that. Thank you! Can you see my reply to neofatalist above and confirm what I'm saying is true?
@_date: 2013-11-18 05:31:52
Alright I'm gonna use coinbase. I made my wallet and everything. Once I buy with coinbase do I need to take any security precautions or do anything? Or do I just wait for my bitcoin to come and transfer it into my wallet once it does?
@_date: 2013-11-18 05:13:35
Awesome I just made one. Are you saying now that this is made to go through someone local? Or should I use the cashintocoins website that blockchain suggests? I'd prefer online but if meeting in person is the only way to do it by tomorrow that might be what I have to do.
@_date: 2013-11-18 05:37:24
Okay this makes a lot of sense. Thank you for your help! Is buying through coinbase pretty easy? Just like buying anything online? 
@_date: 2013-11-18 05:04:26
I'll look into this if Coinbase doesn't work or something. It just seems easier and less sketchy to meet up with some guy and then I don't even know how to receive them from him.
