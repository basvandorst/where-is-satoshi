Literally anything which already exists in the financial sector?  Bitcoin is a solution in search of a problem, and it's not even that good of a solution.  It's hideously inefficient and processes a number of transactions that is a spec of dust when looked at on the global scale.  The blockchain does not actually scale very well even if its users could come to a consensus and actually do anything with it, and the only thing keeping the fees from being laughably bad is that it's subsidized by block rewards which pays the mining bills for those farms in China.

They will.  Because the fucking idiot kept a crime journal and the fact that bitcoin is not anonymous they have this nice trail of money where he sent hundreds of thousands of dollars in an attempt to have people killed.    
    
Additionally, while I disagree with the war on drugs and think many things should be legalized or rescheduled but there are drugs that should never be widely available as they straight up destroy lives, and not just the lives of their direct users.

Nothing.  It's delusion.    
    
There are so many people around here that think the world is just itching to use bitcoin but we're not ready for it or something.  The fact is there is zero reason to own or use bitcoin if you are not already financially or ideologically invested in it.  In fact it's against ones rational self interest to sacrifice all consumer protections and rewards in order to save merchants 2% which is then not passed onto the user.

Better call the bitcoin police to come stop these ne'er-do-wells from doing whatever they want using their bitcoins on the bitcoin network!

Mastercard processes 32,000,000 transactions per day.  It takes Mastercard about 4 seconds to process the same number of transactions that Bitcoin does in a day.    
    
By the end of the year there will probably be more coke machines where you can use Apple Pay than there will be Bitcoin accepting merchants world wide.    
    
I'm not sure what your point was supposed to be but saying that you do not personally know anyone that uses Apple Pay but trying to pretend that the tiny amount of transactions handled by the Bitcoin network is in any sense impressive compared to other options around the world is insane.

We certainly would have entered against Japan but starting with most resources in the European theatre not so likely if it were up to vote and up to everyone to pay.  Even up until the death camps were discovered and made public there were many people saying that was not our war. 
Regarding Iraq, don't forget they tried to sell it as related and an inevitable source for the next attack.  It was sold well enough that people on the right still defend Bush and the war.

Except retailers don't want Bitcoins.  They use services like Coinbase to act as payment processors (no middlemen!) and you give Coinbase Bitcoins then Coinbase gives the retailer real money after taking their fee (no fees!). 
Newegg,  Dell and the others are not taking the coins and running bitcoin wallets but rather receive dollars. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 14:29:38
Purchase goods and services. 
No one wants your internet libertarian funbucks.  Even places that accept payment in bitcoin such as overstock don't want the coins.  They price in USD and get paid in USD, there is just the bitpay service in the middle getting a cut by processing the coins.
What else can fiat do?  How about actually function as a currency.  The 7 transactions per second limit means you will never replace real money.  It would take years and add gigabytes to the block just from processing the Walmart transactions alone on Black Friday.  Forget about doing things where electricity or internet is not an option.
Oh, I know.  What about actually being anonymous?  I can spend cash without it appearing in a public ledger for the world to see and don't have to worry about laundering (tumbling) my real world dollars if I want to buy something.

How many wars do you think would ever be fought?  America did not want any part of WW2 until Japan attacked and even then there was reluctance.  Do you think the world would be better off without American intervention in that area of the world at that time?  How many more would have died in horrible ways or if the Soviet union was able to successfully push back without the Allies coming from the west do you think they would have stopped when they hit Berlin?
Yes there have been a lot of bad choices, mostly involving the middle east, but hindsight is 20/20 and while it's easy to look back now the typical Libertarian isolationist stance is not a good one.

Regulations are bad unless they're regulatuons that protect me in a way I can see directly, then they're kind of OK.  But things would surely be better in libertarian paradise where there are no regulations at all.

What exactly does bitcoin do for the "commonfolk"? Why would the average person want to be their own bank any more than they would want to be their own dentist? What reasoning would persuade everyday users to forgo all consumer protections and credit/debit card rewards in favor of saving the merchant a few % in fees?
@_date: 2015-01-08 18:10:07
Plus or Minus 7% (or more) per day over the last few days.  "Stable"

Well, you see when like 95% of the hashing power was on a stage of 10 dudes at the scaling conference that just proves it's not one or two people so totally decentralized.  That, and just imagine the possibly hundreds of people that make up the last 5%!

Steven Avery did not keep mycrimes.txt and criminal_empire_payroll.xls on a laptop that was being used to chat with an undercover agent at the time of his arrest.

His lawyer opening statement was an admission that he was DPR and started SR, they tried to argue it was someone else that did all the really bad stuff as he was dead to rights guilty.  For fucks sake, he kept a crime diary and a copy of the site on his laptop. An undercover agent messaged him to log in and check something which he them did and that's when they took him. The only way he could have been found more guilty is if he kept a video diary instead of a text one which could have been played for the jury.
Yes, some of the investigators (at least one being a dyed in the wool bitcoin believer) were shady as hell and breaking the laws themselves. They have been caught and now, like Ross, must face the consequences of their actions.

Good thing there were way more agents on the case than just these 2 and the evidence presented by the prosecution during the trial came primarily from those other agents.  If this was some small time case involving a few detectives and all the evidence used was a result of those tainted agents then I would agree but it's a massive case crossing state lines and agencies, each with mountains of information they can produce.

Literally no one should listen to you on financial matters. Ever. Especially not countries or those in power. 
You've repeatedly lost thousands of dollars on penny stocks, altcoins, and trying to catch the falling bitcoin knife.  Your financial decisions cost you your marriage and instead of learning you redpilled up and doubled down. Now it's at the point where you're posting about selling your coins just to eat.
The only way anyone has ever made money the americanpegasus way would be if they took everything you said and did the exact opposite. Well, that and I'd guess your ex is doing better now that you're not flushing part of her income.

It's always worth appealing.  However, based on the amount of evidence presented and what evidence can be produced as clean without these two retards coming into contact with it is still likely to leave all of the current charges regarding drugs and running the market in place and well beyond any sort of reasonable doubt.    
However.... Dumb and Dumber may have saved Ross from the Murder for Hire stuff as they were directly involved in that along with being the reason for the first attempted hire of a hitman even if they did not actually tell Ross to do it. At the very least it undermines that case to an extreme extent and may save him from life sentence(s) in Baltimore which I am perfectly fine with.  For personal beliefs I would say he is absolutely beyond a reasonable doubt the man behind operating the Silk Road and the conviction there will likely be upheld but without the interference or the agents blinded by greed he may not have escalated to the point of paying for the murder of other human beings. Again, with personal belief, say he still attempted to order the deaths of other people but being put into a situation where he believed that was the best course of action makes it more of a gray area and if I was on that jury it would be a tough call for me to make unless there are other facts and information presented that we do not yet know about.

Credit/Debit card purchases are generally done within 15 seconds, they also offer ease of use and many customer friendly features.  Chargebacks that likes to focus on are generally a percent of a percent for most businesses.    
Bitcoin mining currently uses more electricity than some small countries to run software that a single old laptop could support all to do less than 3 transactions per second.  The Visa network alone processes more in any given 5 minutes than bitcoin will do all day. Additionally the blockchain is rapidly growing in size and is filled with junk data that wastes even more space. You have millions or dollars in PC hardware wasting millions of dollars in electricity doing the computer equivalent of busy work so that American libertarians can funnel money to Chinese and Russian mining farms and then HODL the result in hopes of it gaining value. This is a colossal waste or resources with no real value being added to the economy or world at large.    
Things are being built on top of it, but it's all basically "Existing thing... but with BitCoin!".  I would argue that the only way to make bitcoin even remotely usable to average users is to do everything you can to avoid actually using bitcoin and the chain, i.e. bitpay.
