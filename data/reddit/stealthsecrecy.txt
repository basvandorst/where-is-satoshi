Awesome! It took me way longer than 4 hours to learn how to mine cryptocurrency so you're on a good track. Although as I'm I'm sure you'll hear, you'll end up spending more on electricity to power your rig than you'll make with your bitcoin. Mining another cryptocurrency may be more yo your liking as you'll get a better return for your time and you could always exchange it to bitcoin in the end (still won't be profitable, but better than bitcoin)
I always recommend watching this [video]( to those wanting to learn more on how bitcoin works. It does get a little technical but it's not too hard to follow and does an excellent job in explaining.

First you need to have control of your private key, or wait until and if whoever does decides to give it out. Then you need to find an exchange that not only supports the new coin but also allows deposits. And before that you'll need to find a wallet that supports transactions with the forked coin to send it in the first place. And of course you need to move your bitcoin to a new address now that you've exposed your private key, so pay the fee for that. And lastly you hope that the new coin has enough value to make this worth your while.
This has worked for previous forks which actually have something to offer but as we continue with garbage forks being put out because they can they won't be successful.

They're attached to the address that held the btc when the hard fork occurred. After that unless you specifically take the forked coins out they'll stay there.

Yes as long as you don't try to redeem forked coins you can just ignore it and carry on. The only time you have to worry is if you are physically giving out your private key.
@_date: 2018-01-20 21:59:22
With a fork a new coin will make a copy of the current bitcoin blockchain, which means all addresses that had bitcoin at the time of the fork have now been copied and you have an equivalent amount of the forked coin. The issue here is that now you have two identical addresses with two identical private keys, which gives you access to both coins.
In order to send the new forked coin you'll have to use a wallet designed specifically for it, and to use it you're going to have to give it your private key obviously so it can sign the transaction. But now you've given this random wallet your private key, which might be okay but if the developer is malicious they could potentially steal that and go off spending your real bitcoin. So it's highly suggested that you move your bitcoin to another address before you do any of that.

Pretty much every app/exchange for buying or trading crypto has fees for every trade you do. This fee is usually just a percentage of the amount of your trade and is likely already included in the price you see on the app. Exchanges usually don't alter the price but everytime you do a trade you pay a little bit extra. The average fee is 1%.

Just need to change your units. A satoshi is the name for the smallest unit of bitcoin which is 0.00000001 BTC. Right now 100 satoshis are worth a little more than a cent. So in terms of say a $5 ice cream cone would just be 50 000 satoshis, or 50 kilosatoshis or 50ks.

Not selling at $9k. The price was set at $4329.52 and trading hasn't started yet. People are just listing their BCH at that price because it's the lowest you can go, but there's 16x more sell orders than buy orders at that price. Once trading goes live the price will dive from over supply and people dumping their BCH.

You're not paying a big enough transaction fee if it's taking a week. ~400 satoshis per byte get it done in 30 min - 1 hour.

Fees have been going down but if you're sending it to a paper wallet you don't really need it to confirm right away, so you could send it with a fee of ~200 - 300 satoshis/byte and it should confirm when there's a spot.
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:31:29
Could? I thought it was very obvious it will. This will make bitcoin accessible for casual users. More users = more demand = higher price.
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:58:39
For small amounts it's not even worth it with the transaction fee alone. You risk losing it in the exchange if something ever happens but that's pretty unlikely.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:50:22
Up side is you'd only have to pay one transaction fee for every transaction, but other than that it doesn't matter. Personally I would prefer separate accounts.
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:26:04

The mempool has gotten extremely overloaded even in the last few days, the current [recommended fee]( is 990 satoshis per byte, while yours is 211. 
There are some ways to cancel or boost your transactions but it depends on your wallet. I dint have any experience with it but I'm sure you can find info on a quick google search. Otherwise your transaction will leave the mempool 2 weeks after your transaction was sent and you'll be able to send them again.
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:47:01

Definitely don't sell. Bitcoin is so volatile that there's an extremely high chance that it will bounce back over 12k. I'm actually probably going to buy some more now that the price has dropped.
Although you also shouldn't be putting in money that you can't afford to lose. For all we know bitcoin could dive to nothing tommorow, or boost up to $15k+, and you have to be prepared for that to happen.

Bitcoins are set to be mined every 10 minutes, if mining power gets too strong that blocks are being found earlier, the difficulty is increased to help drop it back down. However this method isn't perfect so there is some variation.
Becuase of this we are reaching blocks *slightly* faster than intended, and our estimates are a bit off. We will surely be off of the estimate by at least a few years, but it won't change it much.

A bitcoin address has the characteristics of an "ideal" lock. That means you absolutely must have the private key to send bitcoin from said address. If no one has the private key - no one has access to them. 
There are even "vanity" addresses like [1BitcoinEaterAddressDontSendf59kuE]( that are made up and have no private key. Bitcoin sent there will be forever gone.

This is the cause of the high transaction fee :'(
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:35:47
The fee on the transaction is super low, likely won't ever be confirmed.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:11:22
If you haven't heard coinbase just launched support for BCH so you should see your balance on there.
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:21:36
Since it copies the bitcoin blockchain the address for any forked coins will be the same as your bitcoin address. You can look up your address in any bitcoin gold block explorer.
In order to actually spend them you need the private key attached to your address. If you have that you can import it into a bitcoin cash wallet and then send them from there.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:29:17
They've disabled trading, no one's actually buying at that price. You can see a [*huge ass wall*]( of 11.5k+  sell orders at $8499.03. Real trading price will be around $3000.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:07:07
It'll send the whole balance out, the amount you wanted to send to wherever you put in, and then the "change" will be sent back to an address from your wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:34:39
That sounds good but still has the potential to be abused. I think the best we could is have some aggreence to not accept bitcoins from that address but it's really easy to scatter it around so no one would bother.
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:47:27
It's a good indication that the price is steady and not just a bubble waiting to pop. (Although it's no guarantee)
In reality one day of trading means nothing in the long outlook.

No one knows what the futute of bitcoin looks like. The current all time high is a little less than double of the current price, but it could go higher. It could also never get that high again.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:26:20
Yes, demand has skyrocketed over the past year and thus the price has too. Exchanges don't actually sell bitcoin, they just give you a good interface to sell and buy from other users. Because of this they will never really run out, the going price will just change depending on if there's more sellers or buyers.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:42:32
Just the price coinbase set, and is currently in post-only mode which means no trades are going through. That price seems to be close to the top price from other exchanges, although that price seems to have been pumped up significantly over the past day, likely prepping for the coinbase release.
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:21:53

I think it's about two weeks before you start getting dropped from the mempool, although I don't have much experience with that. I think there are ways you could potentially boost or resend your transaction but again not too familiar with them.

Seriously wtf like either side benefits from this. Just childish.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:39:41
When using the blockchain you at best would have to wait for the next block for a transaction to go through. But there's only so many transactions that can fit in a block, so now that it's congested you either pay a high fee to get in the next block, or wait out hours to find a spot.
With lighting the network is separate from the blockchain and uses payment channels between two or more nodes set up by users. Now these channels can support many more transactions than the blockchain can handle, but if one channel can't keep up with demand, you could just open another one.
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:06:52
Mostly still there, just the price dropped so no one's buying from it. Once people start moving their BCH from the wall to market price it will go away.

The bitcoin is not on the wallet. The bitcoin will be tied to the address that's on the ledger.
It's kind if like a debit card, you can add money by just putting more in your account, and the debit card will work with that money even when it hasn't been connected to anything.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:36:26
Trading is disabled, when it starts again it should be around $3000 like on other exchanges and probably drop from the incoming dump.

It's just the price that GDAX has set. Trading hasn't started so people are placing buy orders at that price, which should nosedive when trading starts, as everyone is dumping their BCH.

Is your client fully synced with the block chain? If not then you won't see your proper balance. But either way you should be able to get your receiving addresses and check what balance they have on the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:33:08
You really don't want to have any digital copy of your mnemonic anywhere, even if it is password locked. It's not completely fail proof. What you should be doing is keeping it solely offline in a safe space, preferably in a different location than your wallet. Unless someone is specifically looking for the mnemonic anyone who finds it won't know what to do with it.
I should add: yes you don't want to keep your coins stored on an exchange since they can be hacked and then you're out of luck. You really just need to put them on there to sell, and that's it.
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:16:57

Get your private keys from the wallet that had BTC at the fork and sweep it into a wallet like electrum cash or a mobile wallet. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:07:27
Oh yeah that's a super low fee, probably won't go through at all. Unfortunately it's just not feasible to send small amounts right now because the transaction fee would be more than you're sending in the first place. You're bitcoin will return to your tablet 2 weeks after the transaction was sent if it doesn't end up going through. You'll probably just want to leave it there until the fee goes down or there is another solution.
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:36:24
It's ideal for you to have moved the bitcoin first, but you'll need the private key of the wallet you had them in at the time of the fork. Once you get that you can sweep the key into a mobile wallet or something like electrum cash and go from there.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:39:41

They implied they would implement it on Jan 1, although technically they did say by Jan 1 IIRC. The biggest issue is that they haven't said anything about it for months and then randomly pushed it out with no announcement or warning. And it's obvious they weren't really prepared that with all trading disabled. There was also some weird price fluctuations going on with bitcoin today that some people find fishy, like there was traders who knew bch was coming today, but I'm not accusing anyone.

Paper wallets are best, and cheaper for giving as gifts. Unless they already have a wallet and you want to bypass the fee. It is a little hard to sweep a paper wallet as you have to send all your coins to a new wallet before spending but it's not awful.

In order to do that you need access to your private key. If your online wallet doesn't support that, then you can't really do anything about it.

It's literally just the public address and private key printed on a piece of paper. You could make one for any currency but bitcoin ones will only work with bitcoins.
As a warning, if you plan to send any bitcoin using the paper wallet, you must first transfer it into another wallet before sending git off, as you'll likely lose all the bitcoin if you send it straight from the paper address.

As others have said you don't need to directly open a channel to anyone you want to send money to. There could even be a central node where everyone has a connection to and you can pay someone through that without any setup. Kind of similar to how ISPs work, where you connect through them, and then they redirect traffic between you and someone else. You don't need to have a direct connection to reddits servers to utilize them.

Woke exchanges have bigger fees, and possibly fees on moving bitcoin alone from one exchange to another. Transactions also take a good amount of time anyways to go through, so by the time the bitcoin got to the other exchange the price would've caught up. It does happen though, just not as easy as it seems.

So bitcoin cash is a hard fork of bitcoin, which means when it was created it started from a copy of the bitcoin blockchain. So anyone who had bitcoin at the time of the fork now has an equal amount of bitcoin cash. Enjoy it!

You can put it up on an exchange at a set price and will immediately sell once it hits it. It's going to take you at least a few hours to get your private key out, sweep it to a new wallet, send it to the exchange, and then actually put it up. Doing it now would make it easier.
Also, if you've had your bitcoin since August 1st, you have some bitcoin cash you can claim and sell too, currently worth about 1/10th of a bitcoin, but still yours.

If you send a transaction with a low fee and it never gets confirmed it will leave the mempool after 2 weeks and you'll be able to spend the money again.

Bitcoin cash is a separate currency which was a fork of bitcoin. This means the current bitcoin blockchain, with all of its transactions and current balances, was copied for bitcoin cash and they started from there. This means anyone who had bitcoin at the time of the fork had the same amount of bitcoin cash as they did bitcoin. Coinbase only recently gave out bitcoin cash to those who had bitcoin with them at the time of fork. Now it is a separate currency with a separate price (about 1/5 of bitcoins price atm). You are free to do whatever you want with your BCH, it's no longer attached to your BTC.

Yes you do have to give the exchange your bitcoin/money before doing trades, but the exchange never actually buys bitcoin itself. You can either place a buy or sell order at a certain amount and certain price. The order won't actually go through until there is someone else who agrees to that price. If you put up a whole bitcoin you might only sell a portion of it if there's no one that wants to buy the entire bitcoin. Or it could go the other way if you want to buy a whole bitcoin but there's only 1/4 of one up for sale at your set price, so you would only get that.
If you take a look at an exchange like [GDAX]( you can see a list of all the buy and sell orders currently set. And you can see how they come and go.

Once you buy from coin base it'll be in your coin base account, you'd need to move it to another wallet if you want to store it locally, although transaction fees are very hight right now. Generally you don't want to trust someone else with your bitcoin but for that small amount it would be okay (at least for now)
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:54:56
1. It is an excellent solution to fees. Since it allows virtually unlimited amounts of transactions, there will never be congestion and thus no need for high fees. It will even significantly drop congestion in the actual bitcoin blockchain which will drop fees there.
2. No idea, but we really need it soon.
3. It works as a "layer" upon the existing bitcoin network. Which allows secure off blockchain transactions. Because of this all we need is someone to open up a payment channel and you could use it, even if no one else is. What's likely is we'll have some company open up a big channel and you will be able to send bitcoin to others through them. I suppose somewhat similar to how you can pay others through PayPal, but not really.
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:28:57

You don't buy anything from them, they sell some extra stuff and there's a donation button but the wallets are free. You generate them from the site, and print them out. That paper will have your public address and private key, which only you own. Then you can send bitcoin to those public addresses and then once someone wants to use them, they can sweep their private key into an actual wallet client.
@_date: 2017-12-17 06:32:06
You said you had a small amount, but have whole coins? Sure doesn't seem that small to me!
So basically how bitcoin cash worked is they hard forked from the normal bitcoin blockchain and creates their own currency using the existing bitcoin blockchain. This means that any for any bitcoin you had at the time of the fork, you now have an equal amount of bitcoin cash. The BCH is tied to your private key (the same as your bitcoin private key).
I think the easiest way would be to use the coinomi mobile wallet app, makes it really easy to sweep both bitcoin and bitcoin cash to one wallet, and then you can move it from there to wherever you wish.
Getting your private keys out of bitcoin core is pretty easy. With ignoring everything passed step 1, use [this guide]( to get extract your private keys.
Next thing to do is get and set up the coinomi app. When you got that done, create a bitcoin (not bitcoin cash) wallet, and once that's done select the three dot menu in the top right of the app and choose "Sweep wallet" it'll prompt you for your private key, and once you do that it will transfer your bitcoin over to the coinomi wallet. Once you've safely got your bitcoin out, you can repeat the process with bitcoin cash (make sure you make a bitcoin cash wallet for that). And even better, you can also claim your bitcoin gold (another hard fork) the same way (I think it's only worth 2% of bitcoin but still worth it). And once you do that you'll be good to go and so what you wish with your coins.
The cassius coins are just those physical bitcoins right? If so then you can claim the bitcoin cash the same way, I think the proximate keys are underneath the sticker on those. Even though it's not required, I would recommend sweeping your bitcoin first since you are exposing your private key online. The address on the coin will be emptied though.
Hopefully that's enough info to get you in your way. Good luck!

Gdax is coinbase's own exchange, and costs nothing to transfer currency between the two, so it's pretty convenient. Although some people have been avoiding them due to somewhat shady actions.

I mean they *could*, but they wouldn't. It would also take every single miner to agree to that though, and that would never happen. Worst that would happen is the person waits a bit longer for their transaction to go through.

It could be used, but it won't be viable. The money you spend on electricity to power it alone would be much higher than you would ever get back in bitcoin. It may be possible to mine some alt coins that would give you a profit over electricity but would never cover the huge cost of the machine.
The only time mining basically any coin these days from a computer is remotely possible is if you have super low electricity costs and you already own the machine for another purpose and aren't looking to make the purchase money back.
If you do want to invest in cryptocurrency, the most cost effective method is to just buy the coins flat out. I agree that mining is a lot cooler but it's just not worth it.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:18:49

Price is determined by supply and demand. Even though there is a small supply increase from mining, if the demand outpaces it the price will go up. That's not to mention there is a constant amount of bitcoin getting lost which lowers the total supply.
@_date: 2019-08-10 08:50:50

Binance had 7000 BTC stolen from them a few months ago and while they were able to cover all those funds there's no guarantee that they will if it happens again.  
Granted that you'd *probably* be fine keeping them on Binance, it's still in your best interest to keep them offline, especially if you have more than $500 invested. It's fine to keep a little bit of funds on the exchange so that you can still trade them if you want to do that but if you plan to HODL then a hardware wallet is the way to go.
@_date: 2019-08-10 07:48:13
I'm saying that Binance themselves covered the losses with extra money they had (probably put away for something like this), but that doesn't mean they are insured and if they lose more than they can cover then you'd be out of luck.

Mining in a pool isn't profitable either, unless you spend thousands of dollars on the newest ASIC miners and have a low electricity cost to boost your profits. And even then it's not a very good idea because it will stop being profitable as soon as the next ASICs come out. Would not recommend.
If you have a power efficient GPU and a low electricity cost then you may be able to find luck mining other cryptocurrencies but even then its pretty hard to turn a significant profit where it is actually worthwhile.

If someone has your 24 secret words they can steal your coins, regardless of whether they have your ledger or not. This is why it's important to keep your words secret and safe.
But apart from that the only way money can be sent out of your ledger is if they have your ledger and your ledger's pin. Ledger live is just an interface to see your public keys and thus your wallet balances but in order to send a transaction you need to connect your ledger to your phone, unlock your ledger, go to the specific app, put in the address on your phone, and then confirm the transaction address on your ledger.

What do you mean by "cashing out"? Like trading your bitcoin for fiat through an exchange? Fees will apply to the full value that you use. So of your exchange takes a 1% fee on fiat trades, then you would pay the 1% on the whole $10,100 if you cashed it all out.
And then depending on where you live technically you should be paying tax on any income you make, which would apply to just your profits. I don't think they really care that much over $100 though.
@_date: 2019-08-23 20:14:47
Well not necessarily but if bitmain doesn't use their extra coins then there would be a lack of supply and the price should go up. There's also the chance that some miners will stop if they aren't getting enough bitcoin from mining and that will allow the remaining miners to make more, until the price goes up enough that mining is worthwhile for everyone again.
@_date: 2019-10-31 08:28:08
In order to cash out you'll have to sell your bitcoin on an exchange, much like how you buy bitcoin. Different exchanges have different rates and fees so it depends on which one you use.
For instance in Canada I use an app called Shakepay to exchange bitcoin for fiat. They allow me to just send bank e-transfers back and forth between the app and my bank account so it's pretty easy to work with. They don't charge any direct fees with doing so, but they do buy bitcoin at about 1% lower than the current market price, so I do lose a little bit if I exchange out. It's really easy and hassle free, but other exchanges may be a bit more complex. Sometimes you have to wait for the withdrawal to be confirmed before you actually get your money, and I'm sure a bunch of other stuff that goes into it. I'm not that versed in the process of every exchange so some could be super easy. Just have to do some research on your own and find the best option for what you want.

Welcome to the community! While I definitely would recommend learning about bitcoin before investing a significant amount of money, if you just want to get in you can do that to.
I am also Canadian and my preferred way of purchasing bitcoin is through ShakePay, which is largely a mobile app but can be used online too. They have zero fees on depositing and withdrawing fiat and the trades are zero fees as well, although the exchange rate is a little bit higher than you would find on a real crypto-crypto exchange like binance. To deposit money all you do is send them an Interac e-transfer and then you have it in your account to trade or do whatever you like with. They do have to verify your identity before you make a purchase but they just auto-approved me when I put in my address and other information. Most exchanges will ask for photo ID and I believe shakepay will if they can't automatically verify you but for me it was real easy.
In terms of storing your bitcoin you can keep it in shakepay, transfer it to a more secure exchange like Binance, or hold it in your own wallet which is the plbest choice. Although you will have to pay a fee for sending the bitcoin out of your wallet back to shakepay or an exchange. Small amount of bitcoin I would just leave in shakepay tbh, or binance. If you do this you technically do risk losing your coins like maybe if the owner of the exchange "dies" when he had the private keys to your coins memorized (actually happened btw, in a different Canadian exchange). But I would consider Binance to be "secure enough" for small amounts, especially if you activate 2-factor authentication.
I don't want to sound like a shill here but shakepay does have a referral program that gives you and whoever reffered you $10 free when you buy $100 worth of crypto. Won't link it here but if you are interested lmk.

I really enjoy it. I've currently been working programming and designing circuits using micro-controllers which has a nice split between software development and hardware development which is what I like doing because I can't decide which I like more. 
I don't find it too difficult, really the hardest part is being able to debug your code (or someone else's which is 1000% worse) and figure out why it doesn't work. But after some experience and critical thinking you get pretty good at it. 
If you're interested in it I would definitely recommend looking into it more. You could even try learning a programming language and see how much you enjoy it. It can be hard to find motivation to learn if you don't have an end goal with something you want to create but I would recommend trying to complete some of the challenges on which kind of represents some of the type of problems you might have to solve. 
You can also make some cool projects with arduino microcontrollers if you're more interested in a bit of that world. 
Currently I have just a 2-year diploma from a tech school but I liked it so much I'm going back to school to get (hopefully) a Bachelor Degree in Computer Engineering.

This is called day trading, and can be profitable, but it can also quickly be unprofitable. What if the price just keeps going down? I started doing this a few months ago and bought at $10.3k. Still waiting for the price to go up to get my profits. I did make a small profit before the price did drop but I'm adamant in not selling for less than I bought it for. I'd rather just wait it out. 
Biggest thing you have to watch out for is trading fees. If you trade on a profit of 1% but your trading fees are 2%, then you've actually lost money.

You could always simplify numbers over 10,000 to look like 10.0 . Bitcoin is moving enough that you still get a decent idea of the price with just the 3 significant digits.

Soon we will live in a time where buying in at $9,700 means you're an early adopter.

The important part is without people actually spending bitcoin the popularity would've never gotten this high. 
Although that is a *lot* of bitcoin.

1,000 in less than 12 hours? *yawn* Wake me up at 15k.

At first I was skeptical, but he's added a picture of himself underneath his signature, so it must be him.

250,000 in one address? That's scary AF.

The wallet is really just a client that handles addresses. You'll make an address from the wallet and then bitcoin can be sent to that address. The wallet will hold both your address and the private key which is your proof you own the address. Backing it up will save the wallet info which includes the address and key. You don't really have to update the wallet that frequently, unless you're moving bitcoins out. If it's for more long term storage you can use a paper wallet which is just your address and private key written on a piece of paper. You can always send bitcoin to that address but before sending bitcoins out you have to resweep it to a wallet client and send all the bitcoin to a new address before you can send it to another address.

While the price does seem to keep on climbing, expect a significant drop coming eventually. It'll smooth out in the long run but a lot of new comers get discouraged when they see their first r big drop and don't realize that's normal.

SO CLOSE

That was one of the best times to buy in.

The first link does say a Trezor One comes in the box, just not advertised anywhere else.

You can't look at the immediate price history with something so finicky like bitcoin. Actually drops in price are good for the coin overall, and today was a huge success.
@_date: 2017-10-13 06:01:44
I bought just a little over one years ago when it was under $1000 just as a hobby. Never expected to any profit from it and chopped it up as lost money when we hung around $300, but still kept it. I don't even see it as money anymore, just really enjoying watching it grow. :)

With robinhood you aren't actually buying crypto, they just let you trade at market prices and you get some, ironically, "virtual bitcoin". In order to get money out of robinhood you have to sell for fiat and withdrawal that. Which is fine if all you want to do is play the market a bit, but in the process you never actually own bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency.

Just depends on the exchange rates and transaction fees.

Which one is about bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-12-07 06:19:10
This is exactly what we need. A year ago you'd be crazy to send someone 2 cents worth of btc over the normal network. Now you can send whatever you want just like that, truly amazing. Reminds me of the good ol' tipping days, the community there was incredible. Then the owner of the tip bot stole all the money but we don't like to talk about that.
@_date: 2019-05-13 22:56:54
The coins aren't in your control. It's like having money in a bank, but the bank is some random guy working out of his mom's basement. In theory everything will be fine, but if the exchange gets breached or otherwise *someone* takes off with your money, then you're just out of luck.
If you want to keep trading then you should keep some coins in the exchange, but only as much as you'd be okay with losing. Any other coins that you don't plan to use for the near future should be kept offline. That way *you* are in control of your coins, and don't have to worry about any funny business going down.
@_date: 2018-12-07 16:01:04
Yeah the owner's company was going down the drain so he used the funds in the tipbot try to save it, but that also failed. The full amount is worth about $250,000 so it was pretty significant. Although it is a good lesson in trusting someone else with your private key.
