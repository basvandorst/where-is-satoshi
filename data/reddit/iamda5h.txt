Bitcoin will not hit 16k again in the next year. Likely two. Only if there’s a huge fiat crisis will bitcoin rise so high so fast, but otherwise don’t get your hopes up. That being said I’m too stubborn to sell anything for a loss. I’m going down with the ship.

lol at that dude who said he sold out to get a car.

Sucks but don’t sell out. Pay off the debt ASAP and wait for the next rise in bitcoin. You could also try getting into some altcoins with that bitcoin but that can be tricky business.

It’s backed though. The process of producing it inherently gives it value. It just needs more acceptance with the laymen

Don’t forget people who live in places with worthless currency like Zimbabwe.

Yeah, by traditional investment standards, waiting for 1000+% profits was crazy. And now all I can do is dream haha.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:10:07
I hope it does..

Buying at $5 and selling at $10 still hurts.
@_date: 2015-10-29 23:36:11
is that why it went up so much?
@_date: 2015-10-30 02:41:56
I meant in relation to the positive publicity.
