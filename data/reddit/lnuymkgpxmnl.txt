Spark is working fine on the Ubuntu desktop.  I installed Spark on the same OS which is running the full bitcoin-core/c-lightning nodes.  Does this mean if I install Spark on my Android phone, I will have to open ports before the phone will be able to see the nodes?

Thanks for confirming, which guide did you use to get both core+lnd nodes to work over TOR?

LND or c-lightning or?

You're right.  That is what I did.  The above was a mistake, as I was trying to type all the commands from memory, and managed to leave the fund out of fundchannel when typing the above question.  
The actual problem was that I was that I did not realize that you're supposed to use the same node\_id to connect to and use the same node\_id in fundchannel.

Will it be able to connect to your own personal fully sync'ed blockchain download?

Will have a look at those now, thank you!

I think I will test c-lightning first.  Apparently it is also a little easier to setup.

It seems bitcoin-core 0.18.0 already has command line hardware wallet support:

Why do you need  and   Doesn't a full bitcoind node verify all transactions already?
@_date: 2019-08-11 14:16:13
Yes, would love to see bitcoin-core add some GUI for the command line hardware wallet options!  Unsure if it's already been added to 0.18.1.  Anyone know

A small price to pray to ensure not having ID (KYC/AML) on some server waiting to be hacked.  Paying extra for piece of mind.
