The funny thing is, he could have been talking about either one...and yet that Other coin clearly is breaking new ground here.

Rootstock is an Alt coin, with 20% paid to the 'devs' who ported other peoples work.  Why would anyone just coming into crypto as a developer even care?

More like why use myspace, with it's centralized miners and coopted Dev team, when we can use the real innovations over at Facebook.

Yes.  I don't like the pool situation.  and I make sure to use a smaller pool in any case so that I'm not contributing to the centralization problem, but this is exactly what happened to me as well, and I go with a pool for these exact same reasons.
It took some effort getting my miner ready. I hate ubuntu, and prefer Arch/Manjaro, but getting Eth/Geth installed on that distro is just shy of impossible because of some missing and incompatible compile libraries..., so after installing ubuntu just to mine a little on the side, and then getting it installed and compiled, I wasn't about to mess around with it.  After 4 days of no blocks I gave up and went to Ethereumpool. They are around 4 GH/s so not a giant pool by any means so I don't feel too bad about the decision.  
Once the clients and nodes are a little more stable, and I am not needing to update every other day, I may change my mind and set up a node but I still don't understand why I had so much variance with 50 Mh/s and 4 days with no blocks...
