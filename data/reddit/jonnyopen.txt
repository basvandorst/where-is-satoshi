Actually, you can if you think of a system like Bretton woods but for Bitcoin. Fiat would be issued based on the possession of BTC

"Some economists and market analysts contend that QE has led to artificially inflated asset prices. Normal market prices are determined by investor preferences, or demand; the relative health of the business environment, or supply; and other macroeconomic factors. When the Federal Reserve begins entering the market to purchase financial assets, it manipulates price signals in three significant ways: lower interest rates, higher demand for assets and reduced purchasing power of money units. Instead of stock prices acting as an accurate reflection of company valuation and investor demand, manipulated prices force market participants to adjust their strategies to chase stocks that grow without their underlying companies actually being more valuable."

Printed or or just created? - this is quite a difference for the economy. Lots of money is created due to fractional reserve every day and somehow we dont suffer huge inflation.

The problem is that the network doesn't seem so decentralized - power is hands of few big mining pools and no big changes can be achieved. Especially when moving from PoW system - there is no incentive for miners to change anything because they already have spend money on specific kind of mining devices.

Especially when taking into consideration quantitative easing and fractal reserve banking.

US stocks are overvalued due to quantitative easing and long time since last economic crisis so ... kinda yes :)

I bitcoin/blockchain have the promise of the beautiful trustless utopian system behind it. I might not turn out so well and wonderful but still i would love to try.

Hungary seems like a good country to move into bitcoin adoption with their inflated currency.

It is hard to explain bitcoin to someone who doesn't get the concepts such as those. It is our mission to try anyway.
