Flooding the market with shitty used GPUs would drive down the prices of new GPUs as well.  Assuming all the miners close up shop all that demand for new GPUs goes away and that drops the price.  Plus at some point as the price of old GPUs drop people decide to switch from new to old even if they're "shitty".  Render farms would happily take miners old cards--they're going to be buying in bulk anyway.  At the point where used GPUs were half the cost of new a lot of people would switch from new to used and figure they could just buy another one if the first one failed.  Somewhere in the middle there supply+demand would find an equilibrium price.

Also the timeframes are compressing which is a sign of a blowoff peak.  Even the trendlines that guy drew are a classic blowoff.  Violation of the upper trendline of resistance and going parabolic and then falling back to the former resistance line is a bit of an indication that this time it's different.  Of course that doesn't mean it can't hit a new higher high via a double or triple top.

If we're going to do charting, then you're ignoring the descending triangle forming over the last 6 months (lower highs, support at about the same value) which is a bearish TA pattern.

if it goes to 2k it goes directly to zero.

that is a 2.95% average annual rate of inflation
- get a 3% raise or better every year
- invest in something that gives better than a 3% rate of return instead of putting money under your mattress.
problem solved.
and it is a 3% tax on taking money out of the economy and putting it under your mattress, which is the whole point.  keep velocity and demand and investment up, and avoid deflationary death spirals in the economy.
