Not sure I follow, this operates under the threat of real world consequences, not arbitrary ratings.

Maybe the endless parade of ANN threads on Bitcointalk that go nowhere because they're just another face in the crowd without trust?


You clearly miss the whole point of crypto, regulation and anonymity cannot co-exist. One must be sacrificed for the other.... this is an attempt to try and balance both.


Or making clear that there are actual consequences for fucking people over, which too often right now, there isn't.
Pretty simple concept really, but you obviously have a hair across your ass to have an intelligent discussion about the whole thing, so fuck off.

That's an ultimate solution, but no one is stepping in with that financial backing yet. This is in the context of a free service that helps build confidence by introducing risk to the would-be scammer.

I agree that trusted services will emerge, but that doesn't solve the issue that legitimate entrepreneurs have an unnecessary barrier to earn trust, and that countless scammers will get away without consequences until the market has matured.

No trust is required on this end, there's no risk to the entrepreneur, and no cost incurred to anyone. There is no incentive to let bad actors go free. The comparison to an SSL cert is identity validation, that is the deliverable.
It's not entirely unfair to compare to the BBB, except the BBB has no teeth except feedback. Releasing a scammers ID can have consequences to the scammer.
