Even better, insert agents within ISIS or related groups and send them bitcoin. Introduce them to it, watch them using it, create some big story around an event marginally connected to it, then create media outrage.

Who do you think supplies terrorists with money and weapons? 
This moment is weird, I think so too. But it's really only a bit hyperbolic. Weird that it doesn't get talked about more, more than anything else.

I disagree. I love learning. 
What's your viewpoint?

Understood. My point is that actions can have effects which are opposite to what was predicted in such a novel space.

Saw a great presentation on this by...I think 21 coin. 
Basically you can measure centralization across multiple facets of a technology. You're only as decentralized as your most centralized facet. If someone wants to attack a network most easily, go after the most centralized portion. 
With Bitcoin when looking at multiple facets, mining is the most centralized and the point of failure. It would only take compromising a few pools for there to be a successful attack. 
So basically you're exactly right in your line of thought. Bitcoin IS pretty centralized.

You left out the next chapter of your story. After WikiLeaks and Assange were cutoff from PayPal and VISA they started transacting in BTC and their wealth exploded.

Interesting questions. 
I've heard futures and possibly options. Also NYSE has announced they want to offer crypto futures. They will likely be later to the game. There will be another large exchange around the time of the CME. 
Ultimately there's a ton of first mover advantage. So whoever offers the best product first will likely capture all the market share. This is what usually happens. 
Futures and options could cause a ton of instability for a while. Shorting can lead to huge gains for whales as was recently seen in the BitFinex incidents. Think that but on a large institutional level. 
That could even impact BTC very significantly and lead to lots of losses for the small guys if you're not careful. 
Ultimately though it will likely lead to more stability. Not sure why. If you know, please explain.
But derivatives are scary things. Futures are derivatives. Same as the shit that caused the Great Recession 10 years ago. An event which spurred Nakamoto-San to create Bitcoin: a digital currency. 
There's more but that's enough for now.

Sort of right on the last bit about Wall St role in the crash. You could say any bubble and crash is due to human irrational exuberance...and for that reason it doesn't actually add any value in the discussion of Wall St role. 
There was another belief that caused the crash separate from prices always going up. Wall St espoused the belief (even manipulating ratings agencies) that their mortgage backed securities were low risk and that a critical mass of homes wouldn't foreclose at once.

Very interesting. I tried to introduce many people to Bitcoin today by gifting Bitcoin in a nice Christmas wallet for white elephant at work. 
$4.20 in fees for a $10 gift. Ouch. Hard to convince randoms about the value of "cryptocurrency" when one transaction costs that much and takes 8 hours.

Woah that gave me feels.

I wanted to spread the Bitcoin Joy this holiday season and also gauge reactions to Bitcoin. So my gf and I decided to use Bitcoin as a white elephant gift at our company holiday parties. 
First, nobody stole the Bitcoin. The person who opened it got it early and knew what it was. They were cool with it. 
Here's the crappy part: transaction fees. To put $10 of BTC on a paper wallet in &lt;12 hours cost $4.

TLDR: don't worry guys I'm just really busy working with law enforcement. This is the part where I suspiciously don't mention anything about the canaries even though this is a response to that.

I love how he keeps saying nobody understands Bitcoin. Then proceeds to make comments comparing Bitcoin mining to housing inventory in a failed analogy. He couldn't even finish the comparison cause he knows so little about Bitcoin. 
Genuinely curious how he got a Nobel prize and doesn't know the most basic thing about Bitcoin while having so much ego to talk about it this way on TV.

I’d be interested in how a portfolio made out of low correlation assets would do when using Shrimpy for rebalancing. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 20:27:51
They do though. There’s a 1% spread between buy and sells which is effectively the same as charging commission. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 01:48:47
Good point. 
Would you hire someone who put Bitcoin as a skill on their resume?
@_date: 2017-09-12 20:29:47
Nobody really knows what will happen. My guess would be that all cryptos lose a ton of value as people need money to actually buy things. But your guess could be just as right. 
It will be a sort of test for cryptos.

I just had this conversation this weekend. I know that ARK and Coinbase did a study showing BTC is not well correlated (near 0) with most other asset classes. Do you really think this will hold during a financial crisis though or will many (especially the more noobs get in) start selling BTC assets just like stocks?

Oh you don't like centralized power and banks? Why don't you loan us your money.

‘One crypto miner in Plattsburgh, David Bowman, argues that it would be a mistake to disallow new mining operations. “It’s basically in the early stages of development like the Internet was,” Bowman told Vice’s Motherboard.
“In my view an outright moratorium would hurt the city more in the long run because it would miss out on all that.”’
Yeah don’t see how setting up a mining operation which costs the city 100x for electricity benefits anyone except the miner. Not sure what “all that” is. 
The ban looks like a good idea actually.

I'm pretty sure $419 -&gt; $4148 is 989.9% not 113%.

Thanks for the suggestion. I actually never formatted the computer so if I had an offline wallet it's there somewhere. Just haven't been  able to find it searching for obvious things. 
Plus side maybe I'll find it in 10 years when BTC hits the moon :)

Interesting point I'd never heard or considered, but wrong that everything just finds equilibrium and is the same. Read Warren Buffet's shareholder letters from the 70's when there was huge inflation. He talks over many years about the decrease in company earnings relative to inflation. This made a huge percentage of companies during that time actually have negative earnings relative to government bonds. Except there are no Bitcoin bonds. 
TLDR It might not just be in the margins, it could be that most investments no longer make sense. 
Interestingly, Buffet also says that high PE ratios now are not worrying because of the low interest rates (opposite of 70's). 
@_date: 2017-09-20 17:28:22
Thanks for the suggestion, unfortunately no. Do you know what wallets were popular around that time?

There has been research done showing a weak correlation between BTC and other asset classes (near 0). This was done about a year ago. I highly doubt this correlation will stay true during a recession. 
Not enough people realize exactly HOW banks fuck them over. Not enough people know what inflation is. There are already derivatives built around BTC such as JP Morgan's. These people that own these are not holders. Investments will evaporate and BTC will tank. 
However, I wouldn't be surprised if cryptos recover more quickly AND get more positive media coverage after the initial told-you-it-was-tulip-mania and people try to figure out what caused the crash. Answer: banking system. 
@_date: 2018-03-03 04:00:47
Not at all what happened if you read the article. But glad it sounds like that. 
The people that sent the BTC never got refunded when someone else didn’t accept it. Coinbase just kept the coins.

FDIC insurance doesn't protect against volatility at all. It protects up to $250k of deposited money that's it.
