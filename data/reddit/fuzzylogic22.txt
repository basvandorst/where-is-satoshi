Good rule of thumb, if something is running up 5\-10&amp; for several days in a row, be skeptical of buying. And if you buy and then it drops, selling should be the last thing you do unless it looks like an apocalyptic drop.

I'm saying if it's the case that it's crashing 90% it's good to sell when it's only down 10%. That's just common sense.
Of course, predicting that would take some big consensus based on public news like the EU and USA banning crypto or something.

Season 3 finals was not the 2013 final at Blizzcon. It was about 145k on Twitch, and it was also streaming on Blizzard's official site without a viewer number (and I know many were watching because Twitch was lagging). I would link you to fuzic.nl but it's down indefinitely.

But you just agreed it affects both equally, so how could that make my logic wrong?
@_date: 2018-03-18 17:35:17
It doesn't matter. That has nothing to do with it. It affects both decisions equally. I've said this three times. Whether the price going up or down is completely random or you know about the future with 100% certainty, the two decisions are the same regardless. So what you're talking about is totally irrelevant to my point.
@_date: 2018-03-19 00:16:18
We're helplessly irrational. The funny thing is, as much as I've argued stridently here about this, my actual behaviour doesn't really jive with this understanding either. I'm a sucker for sunk cost fallacy and loss aversion. Recognizing it is one thing, but actually biting the bullet with real money and doing something your instincts tell you not to do is very hard.
@_date: 2018-03-18 22:05:14
Are you fucking serious? Read up on the hindsight bias? My dude, I've worked in behavioural economics I know the hindsight bias better than you do. Which is clear, because you for some reason are completely incapable of understanding that it has NOTHING to do with what I'm talking about. Please actually respond to what I'm saying, and stop repeating your irrelevant point.
I mean, for fucks sake, you already admitted it applies to both situations equally. So how in God's name could it make one of them different from the other??? THINK!
@_date: 2018-03-18 13:56:34
No... Hindsight bias affects both buying at 20k and selling at 20k the exact same amount. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 22:04:13
You really don't understand the point I'm making? Is it that hard to get? I'm kind of shocked.
@_date: 2018-03-19 20:16:47
I haven't switched what I said. I've always been talking about opportunity cost. If you have a finance degree, I have to admit there's a decent chance I'm missing something basic here, but you haven't shown me what it is anywhere.
So let me lay this out as clear as I can:
I am defining cost as both actual cost and opportunity cost, because I see them as the same thing for the purposes of evaluating a single investing decision where outside factors are equal.
The cost of *holding* 1 BTC when it was $20k instead of *selling* is, as of today, $11.5k.
The cost of *buying* 1 BTC when it was $20k instead of *not buying*, is as of today $11.5k.
Which part of that is wrong?
@_date: 2018-03-18 07:34:32
Kind of, if you compare it to optimal decisions at every second of every day, and also assume the most lucky rolls of the dice at every given moment. That's obviously not attainable though. 
When you boil it down to 1 person with one decision, the difference between optimal and not is quite simple, and so you can look at it this way.
@_date: 2018-03-18 17:28:17
I didn't expect it to be a controversial statement. Thanks for the backup.
@_date: 2018-03-19 22:36:21
Okay, but that's just semantics isn't it? At the end of the day, trading BTC for USD or trading USD for BTC are both investments in a basic sense. So there was an opportunity to "invest" in 20k USD for the cost of 1 BTC. Yeah? So it's not really about sunk cost or a retroactive analysis at the time you are deciding.
To reiterate, why are the two situations not the same as I described them, besides what names you give the costs?
@_date: 2018-03-18 17:30:16
Psychologically, yes, but I think the two decisions in fact require the same confidence interval to be correct, discounting any other factors involving liquidity or fees.
@_date: 2018-03-18 15:00:51
I never said anything like this. Your decision to buy 5 bitcoins would be the same *in this moment* to the decision of someone who holds 5 not to sell *in this moment*. That's also assuming all other things being equal in terms of resources available (i.e. not having to take out a loan).
I never said it means you'd be just as well off overall. 
Do you dispute my logic or are you just gonna hand wave it away?
@_date: 2018-03-18 17:31:33
Compare buying at 20k to not selling at 20k. How much have you lost since then compared to the dollar value you would have with the converse decision? It's the same thing. Whether that dollar value came from prior investment in BTC, or the lottery, or you pulled it out of your ass, none of that makes any difference for what decision is correct at that moment. 
@_date: 2019-01-04 20:11:14
The premise of this thread is related to value though.
@_date: 2018-03-19 18:17:44
I am not judging behaviour in hindsight. That is the simple point you are incapable of understanding. My point stands irrespective of what happened in the past or the future. 
I'm starting to feel like you're the one trolling me, because I've explained this 4 times and you don't even seem to be reading my posts.
To convince me otherwise, answer this question: since you already admitted hindsight bias applies to both situations equally, how could it make one of them different from the other?
@_date: 2018-03-19 05:04:25
Sure, and that goes to outside factors. Like on Deal or No Deal, it usually made sense to take the deal towards the end despite it being negative EV, because the life impact of the money didn't simply scale at 1:1.
But if you're just talking about 5% in your investment portfolio which you could have sold or added on, that's where this applies.
@_date: 2019-01-04 19:18:38
That's like comparing furniture to hot dogs because they are both bought and sold in retail outlets.
@_date: 2018-03-18 06:07:05
At one particular moment, if you decide not to sell 1 BTC for 20k or you decide to buy 1 BTC for 20k, in both cases you are +1 BTC and -20k. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 14:02:11
It doesn't matter if it's two investments, we're talking about the moment you are either deciding to buy or not sell your BTC. At this moment, where the resources you are using for this decision came from doesn't matter.
Take these two premises: 1) Selling all your BTC at 20k and then buying it back at the same price a minute later is no different than just holding it (ignoring fees for the sake of the larger point).
2) Put a pin in the moment between selling it and re-buying it. At that moment, your decision is identical to someone who never had any. You have 0 BTC and are considering buying some at a given price.
Agree with both of these?
So based on those two premises, it logically follows that buying at 20k and not selling at 20k are the same thing.
@_date: 2018-03-18 23:05:29
My point is when it hit 20k, everyone had a decision to make whether to buy in or sell. I'm saying whether you chose to buy in at 20k or decided against selling an equivalent amount in that moment, the result was the same.
That's all. If that seems obvious, yeah, I agree. I was responding to a post that implied something else.
@_date: 2018-03-18 08:18:21
You're just restating the obvious face value interpretation as if it proves me wrong, when my whole point is that interpretation is fallacious. 
May be this will help. Say I buy a lottery ticket for 5 dollars and win the 10 million jackpot. I then put all of it into bitcoin at 20k.
Well, I'm still up on my 5 dollar ticket by about 3 million. But that's totally irrelevant. It's no different if you turned 5 dollars of bitcoin into 10 million and then could have sold it but did not, and now it's 3 million. Exact same situation from the standpoint of what you did it did not do when it was 20k. Right?
@_date: 2018-03-18 23:54:11
Okay, I see where the confusion is coming in. I'm treating opportunity cost and actual cost as the same. 
So in the second scenario, by not selling at 20k you missed out on the same amount of USD that you spent at 20k in the first scenario. They don't feel like they are both a cost, but they are. That's the crux of what I'm saying.
So in the second scenario you profited $600 compared to the money you put in, but you did not profit $600 when comparing to what you would have had if you sold at 20k. In the latter comparison, it's the same.
@_date: 2018-03-18 22:03:33
What assumption?
@_date: 2018-03-19 00:07:47
Psychology actually, which led me to behavioural economics. I still don't know what a derivative is or how to short a stock, but I feel like I have a pretty good handle on the biases and irrational behaviours of investing and commerce.
@_date: 2018-03-20 00:57:46
But why does sunk cost matter when you're just talking about one decision in a vacuum and how much value it brings? Isn't that thinking the very definition of the sunk cost fallacy?

I said this in the other thread (let's keep it here now), but yeah I did a data analysis internship for a BE consulting firm for about a year. I got to meet Dan Ariely. It was pretty awesome. Before that I didn't know much about it, and never really thought my background in psychology would ever interact with economics like that. So it remains a great interest for me.
@_date: 2018-03-18 14:08:51
You could say the same thing about buying at 20k, though. Assuming the drop to 7k is equally unknown to both the potential buyer and the potential seller that both believe the value to be more than 20k, the decision to not sell and the decision to buy are the same from a game theory perspective.
But you have made a decent point here, as the buyer has no choice but to buy in at a higher price if the expected future value makes it worth it, while the potential seller has no reason to sell without knowing about a drop. So this comes down to options on the table, I suppose, rather than abstract game theory.
@_date: 2018-03-19 00:22:56
No, I had a internship doing data analysis at a BE consulting firm. 
Still doing data analysis but not in BE. But it remains a great interest.

@_date: 2018-03-18 08:02:50
You're appealing to a sort of reverse of the sunk cost fallacy. The past doesnt matter. What matters is what you have at any given point and how to maximize your value going forward. 
Whether you decide not to sell sell 1 BTC for 20k and it's now 7k, or you decide to buy 1 BTC for 20k and it's now 7k, your return on that decision is identical, a 13k loss.
@_date: 2018-03-19 18:16:01
Sure, more outside factors. My initial point was just to point out that if someone bought some BTC at 20k or someone held it and thought about selling but didn't, the effect is really basically the same even if it feels way different since the latter case is sitting on a profit. I agree with you overall.
@_date: 2018-03-18 17:20:26

The past doesn't matter when it comes to the value of any given decision. It matters in terms of your pocketbook. Two different things. Whether you've personally lost or gained on your investment previously matters for your bottom line, it doesn't matter for whether you should buy or sell at this moment.

That may be true psychologically, but really not selling at 20k is identical to buying at 20k
