And what does this have to do with the fact of using bitcoin rather than government issued currency?

So, that is what you call elaborate... Ok. I just hope you didn't expect to change my mind with this. Without a third party being able to judge whether the work was done or not, it just can't work.

What I mean is, this is not a technological question. Without a third party to be able to judge that the work has been done, there is no conceivable way to be 100% sure you will get paid if you did the job and simultaneously guaranteeing me that I won't have to pay if you didn't do the job (unless, of course, the job is trivial and there somehow is a way to objectively know whether it is done or not, which is... uncommon). This can only rely on trust or on some kind of authority, which is kind of ironic.

How would bitcoin prevent the government from taxing people? Every year, you need to declare what you earned, and it needs to match what the company you work for has declared paying you, and it needs to match the books, that can be verified, and the book needs to match the invoices, and so on. Bitcoin can be traded completely anonymously while both parties are willing to do so. When things become more official and well established, there is a paper trail that has nothing to do with the origin of the currency used to exchange value.

Fair enough.

The bitcoin blockchain would sure prevent transactions of 10 billion (not sure I'm counting the zeroes right) bitcoins from existing. Inflation per se is not an option when you can't ever have more than 21 million bitcoins in circulation. Of course, the shortage of foods and goods would still exist, but this specific monetary phenomenon would not.

Whereas with bills, you can add "no digital data about any transaction ever".

I'm aware of that, but many people think it is not enough to follow the money trail, so I just give it up as a whole and consider bitcoin trading as anonymous because it doesn't disturb my point.

That is a good thing.
@_date: 2018-04-19 14:56:04
Oh, that is something I certainly wasn't aware of. Can you elaborate on how the bitcoin protocol can allow this kind of things?
@_date: 2018-04-19 13:14:04
How could anything could be easier with bitcoin than with bills? The blockchain is a register of all transactions, there is an actual digital paper trail there!
