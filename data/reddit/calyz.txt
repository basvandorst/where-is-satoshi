Dude, do this. Invest half now and see where it goes. Invest the other half in 2 weeks. If its lower you made up your loss and wont be mad ad yourself. If its higher you just missed some gains but atleast you spread your risk again. Goodluck and dont panic sell or buy ever.

I just think it will do the same as last futures, pump price a bit and stabilize even more. Last time people wirh tin foil hats predicted massive shorting and evil plans by bankers, wont happen. Alts are getting more interesting tho

This is not an educated guess, do you know how ridiculous this sounds. You are giving a coin a price based on some characteristics that cant be measured in coin value. It would be like saying a year ago, hmm noo btc is not worth 600 thats way to high for all the problems, its worth 50 max. Its just a ridiculous guess based on nothing. The more people join in, the bigger every crypto gets in price, btc just seems to be the main entry point. Now if you would really take an educated guess you would know the big  amount of resistance of buyers are at 10k cause of the psychology. We already made 20k the moment it hits 10k whales will buy everything until atleast 12 voor an easy x2 next few weeks. But hey     “iota is not working right now so my guess is 0.0001 cent for the coin seems appropriate”, get out of here this triggers me so hard.

Dude, its economics at its simplest. Theres no product cost or anything its just supply and demand and meet in the middle. If more people want a finite thing they are willing to pay a higher price for it cause theres only so much of it. Price will go up. If nobody wants them anymore they will sell, but there are fewer people to buy them so those people are only going to buy for a lower price cause market is flooded. Price will go down. Thats it. Its a market completely controlled by what amount people are willing to spend on it. I can make up a childish example about apples but I think if you don’t understand supply and demand core economics you shouldn’t be looking into investing. In my country they teach you this at age 12 but whatever, im in a salty mood today. Feel free to rage on me

Thanks for this.

I dont think you realise what needs to happen to completely replace btc, the exchanges alone would all need to reference against usd or another coin thats not stable. Btc will be the new gold and the fiat it represents will be a few stable low fee altcoins. Btc cant be replaced
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:02:00
If that alt selling at 20$ is rated via btc, which they are on most exchanges, you broke even, but doubled in bitcoins if you sell back. Because btc halved but your alts doubled.

Wow he really said it. We need to start showing people that comment.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:11:49
Hears from a friend about something he doesnt understand but can make money in. Invests 300k without doing any research, now wants to kill himself after a dip of just 30%. You dont deserve that money if you use it like that. Hope you sold at 11k
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:33:47
What are you saying lol, theres a place for btc and ltc in this market, with btc as gold and ltc as silver and bcash at 0 dollars. Have a good new year everyone.
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:04:42
Amazing that sheeple can’t think for themselves, and make these kind of comments without knowing anything about the subject. It’s a good thing a lot of other dutch people who don’t repeat the herd are seeing the light these past months.

Noob here, but maybe my fresh eyes will give you some perspective. When i got into crypto not long ago and tried to get my first crypto on an exchange i found out the easiest way and most used way to get other crypto is to do it via bitcoin, and its not even getting into it, almost all exchanges look at btc/x crypto so my conclusion is that bitcoin is the base of all cryptocurrency. It would also explain why today when bitcoin crashes a little, every other crypto crashed aswell. For me this just means that btc will keep rising and going and be more viable than altcoins for a long while until this concept changes. So if you think other currencies will be more viable, it still makes bitcoin the base investment for now, and i think this will go on for awhile. But thats just my newbie view on things. Do with it as you please

Don’t be so salty that normal hedge funds and investors earn their yield in normal assets instead of high fluctuating crypto. Theres nothing wrong with that. Sure in the long run btc will overcome and we all will be very happy. But funds, even private funds want steady yearly yields over their capital. They want a steady growth each year, not years of fluctuating until they triple or something. Thats not how bankers/hedge funds/pension funds or private investors work man. Btc is a very safe asset in the long run, and it will and does shine. But companies go for yearly growth and that will keep being true until fiat truely collapses. But that has to happen first before you can make these statements. But sure i hope it does. From buffets point of view he will be right until fiat is completely collapsed, lets see that happen, but don’t be so salty at a guy making less riskier investments with a lot of money
@_date: 2019-01-04 16:05:58
Agreed. With inflationary currency like we now have real estate is a perfect way of keeping up with the way currency is becoming worth less, if fiat collapses ans we go to a deflationary currency like bitcoin, real estate won’t be such a good way to increase/keep worth. Could be a real problem i haven’t thought of before. It could mean a definitive move from buying to renting a house. Interesting though, we will see in the next 10 to 20 years.
@_date: 2019-01-04 15:17:51
Sure it has plenty of risk. I was talking about the years he mentions, from 2016 to atleast 2018 Q1. If a hedgefund can even make a yearly return of 5% on their investment than that is a normal win, just like he did. The problem with bitcoin like I tried to explain is that sure it will prolly be risk free if you take an investment time of atleast 10 years. But these funds don’t go for 10 year gambles. They go for yearly steady returns. That’s why a lot of pension funds invest in real estate as it grows with inflation and mostly generates a yearly growth of 5% yield. Bitcoin is only a low risk investment in the very long run or until fiat collapses, while a company like apple has yearly growth goals and management/shareholders/lots of info to make predictions on/risk vs yield management. Like i said, stocks like this will always be lower risk until fiat collapses, which i hope will be in the coming 5 years in a new recession, but it still might not happen so soon. Funds and banks aren’t looking for 20 year plans with a lot of volatility they are looking for constant growth.
@_date: 2019-01-03 23:35:10
So mr buffet made a solid no risk investment that gave him atleast a 10% yield per year instead of a high risk investment on bitcoin. Dont get me wrong i love bitcoin and have a lot of my spare money in it, but if youre a fund going for low risk yield on a lot of money, his investment was obviously the best bet
@_date: 2019-01-03 23:42:07
Hmm maybe i understood that comment wrong, i understood it as that rat poison would be almost a better investment than making .4 bil in 3 years because he missed a x9. We all know bitcoin is going to succeed but if youre running a big fund you don’t need to take such big risks with such big ups and downs to get even more money. Thats what we are in for though, although it will all work out in the end.

Im totally fine with that, I just dont see any entertainment value in saying the dip is still to come lol. But alright
@_date: 2019-05-16 11:28:24
They did if they bought 1 btc. But dont be hyped too much by these thoughts, youve seen what happened after 19k. Only invest what you are willing to lose. Would invest atleast 50% in safe non-volatile assets like savings or a balanced stock portfolio. Btc can go up and btc can go down, nobody knows for sure
