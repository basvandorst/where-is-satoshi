can you sell on circle? I mean i've seen the "sell" button, what I am really asking  is there a way to deposit btc into circle and sell it?

I am curious to see if their launch is going to have any affect on the price. I'd expect the price tick in the upper direction since they make it so easy to buy.

if mass adoption of bitcoin would come, it would drive the price up because of scarcity.

Does this company name rhyme with "...oinbase"?

just curious how do you withdraw USD from btc-e?
@_date: 2015-03-05 16:26:28


signing up for stuff usually involves first activation email with activation link, which you would not receive because whoever sends you that first automated message is probably not going to pay because they most likely send from a "no-reply" address

reported, 
you fixed it, 
@_date: 2013-12-22 07:48:35

@_date: 2013-04-12 15:25:10

This is simply not true. 48 states currently require it. Looks like you didn't even bother to do any research yet regarding state licensing. It is just not cool to claim you are registered, if you don't even know what it is involved in it.


Why would I need to spend $100k+ ? I am not the one opening the exchange, you are. I don't need your "opinion". All I wanted just an honest answer from you and what I got was either completely incompetent response or a deliberate lie. In either case this is totally not cool.
All this is not to diminish your efforts. Bitcoin community needs more alternatives to mtgox. Seriously do your research first and get all the licensing, and I will be the first one to signup and trade on your exchange. Until then this looks like a setup for "another exchange closed" headline in a few months.

When a company has $100,000,000,000 (yes 100 billion) cash, it can afford to buy any "regulator" and regulate anything they please in their favor.
The solution should not come through regulation, but through consumers choosing the alternative product/platform.

I've asked to be specific, so lets see how about California? California requires money transmitter license. However your company is not on the list of registered money transmitters? I've searched for both Payward and kraken - none to be found,  how come?
Here is the source: [California Directory of Money Transmitters](
Are you operating/registered by some name other than Payward Inc or kraken, if so what company name is it?
Also what about New York, Delaware specifically, are you registered with those states, I mean do you have money transmitter license from those states?
Just doing my research, because no one wants to put money into another Bitfloor fiasco.
