All valid points. I "bought"some coffee at starblocks and I was amazed how easy it is to buy the coffee. Indeed a third party could  handle the payments, but this is already done at this moment with most of the merchants that accept bitcoin, visa, etc. And this 3rd party can offer reduced costs because of the reduced transaction fees. The third party can buy coffee beans out of the LN for the coffee shop without closing channels.
I think it is best to wait for Segwit adoption and lightning adoption, if fees are still high, increase blocksize.

You don't need a channel with the shop. Just a channel with a random person should be OK. That random person needs to be connected to the rest of the lightning network.
Once the channel is created you can spent in any shop you want till you channel is empty. When empty, fill the channel with new funds through an exchange. You never have to close a channel.
So if you create a channel with 0.0100 bitcoin you should be able to spend 100 coffee's (2 USD/cup) at random shops.

Haha I knew it! Ah well you guys probably also copy/paste the LN 
code when it is a success on the Bitcoin chain. And than it is awesome...
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:26:33
You should open a channel with someone who is direct or indirect connected (via other persons) to the shop.
@_date: 2018-01-05 17:12:34
Indeed. If the coffee shop buys coffee beans he can use a channel with funds from customers to pay for the beans, this clears  up space for more customers. He won't even have to close the channel.
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:51:34
You don't have to close a channel, you can fill your channel again with funds from an exchange.

Why am I still on reddit....

Can you please answer my question? I really want to know...
@_date: 2018-01-05 16:12:57
That is awesome! Thank you for this information. LN is better than I expected.
@_date: 2018-01-05 12:39:13
Nice clean explanation, answered a lot of questions I had about spending multiple times, in this example coffee. 
When your channel is empty, just close the channel and open a new one.
Really easy to test it yourself on testnet:
* Download Eclair Wallet for android on Google Play 
* Put testnet BTC on wallet (
* Open channel with funds (2 clicks) 
And you are ready to go spent coin with 1 SAT fee per transaction ( When funds on your channel are depleted, close channel and repeat.
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:29:02
I fail to see what the benefit is for the other party to close the connection. He would pay for the closing of the channel. 
But you could always choose to setup a channel with a trusted partner.

Useless comment, some people do drive cars without knowing what direct injection is, still the car runs great. Are you invested in B-cash?
@_date: 2018-01-05 14:42:47
A channel with yourself does not make sense.
@_date: 2018-01-03 14:45:16
It's easy:
* Download Eclair Wallet Testnet
* Put BTC on wallet
* Open channel with funds (2 clicks)
And you are ready to go spent coin with 1 SAT fee per transaction (coffee, cake, beer, etc.). When funds on channel are depleted, close channel and repeat.

At this moment there are a few hundred users on the lighning network, I only had 1 channel with the default channel created in the Eclair app. That was enough to be connected to the Startblocks coffee shop.

Awesome idea! Great that you take the effort to promote lightning adoption. Can you imagine if one of these big newspapers accept lightning payments... 
I will surely buy me some articles if implemented!

Try to open 1 or 2 more channels. LNbig should do it.
@_date: 2019-03-31 04:51:11
Try to open a second channel with LNbig. that should solve your problem.
@_date: 2019-03-05 18:03:27
I solved it by changing the eclair.conf on the server by adding the line:
This should be solved in the next release.

If you want you can open a channel to my node:
 024c05b9a8f38a44d1b4c13c52f9e6fefadaaecf9970fb055d3a552f7e6b5dc831 
I will open a channel back with the same amount, so you have an unfunded channel where you can receive payment on. In the mean time we can monitor those 2 channels to see what is going on.

250000sat are the total funds in the channel. You can't see on the "outside" on which side the funds are. Only the 2 channel holders can. Yes, that is privacy...

Looks like you need 15mBtc to trade a contract of SPX500

Everything looks to work fine.

The admin donated some Bitcoin on my exchange wallet for my feedback in the chat on the website. Awesome!
@_date: 2018-02-22 03:39:38
Looks legit. Just put 0.0050 Bitcoin on the wallet of the site. Now lets see if I can go short on a SPX500 contract... Because we all know we are long due for a big correction of that redundant financial system...
@_date: 2018-02-22 03:52:46
I get an error when placing a bid:

Nice said sir! So, stop whining, sell your 2x coins ASAP, buy now a miner or fire up that GPU just after a split, it might be profitable ;)

I talked to the admin. Nice guy! There indeed was a glitch into the system. But the contract is stil there.
Things like this make me Bitcoin Bullish.

" Our target JDK is now OpenJDK 11, and we suggest that you use it to run  Eclair. You can still use Oracle JDK8 (but it's up to you to check your  licensing options). See [\ for more details. "
What does that mean? Do I need to install OpenjDK before upgrade? Whatever that means?
