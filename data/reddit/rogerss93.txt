I do hope so, I would love to see PayPal die a fast and painful death, I can't like Musk after how he fucked over my legitimate business

So Ross knew about the investigation?

I'm in this situation, how do you eBay?

The CC option uses PayPal's 'Guest' feature, which used to work even for perm-banned accounts, but now you can't even use it to pay by card (all bank cards are linked to national insurance/social security numbers)

Voat is a funny site - full of Reddit rejects who left in protest over censorship and banned subs.
Guess what Voat have just done?

This. oh god this.
As a casual bitcoin user that came to this sub for help getting started, the vast majority of you guys are almost parodies of yourselves.
This sub is actually worse than in terms of the quality of the subscribers
@_date: 2015-05-27 12:10:32
huh it's at 19% now, strange, wonder where I got the 70 figure from

People are so quick to defend a man who allegedly ordered hits on people.
They also seem to think TSR was 100% drugs and not a general black market.
@_date: 2015-05-27 06:37:06
Yet 70% of the sites you frequent run on Wordpress
@_date: 2015-08-05 11:55:38
This sub rivals in terms of unintended hilarity
You guys constantly ridicule people who doubt bitcoin, yet play the victim at every opportunity.

Can someone give me ELI5 of what block size is and what raising it would do?
@_date: 2015-07-09 15:55:49
nice, thanks
@_date: 2015-07-06 15:26:04


This is key.
I came here when I was ready to use bitcoin, and it was full of threads mocking anyone who doubted it, even now it's full of posts about how bad banks are and how everything else is inferior.
Like, ok.. we get it, stop stuffing it down our throats, it's almost as if they're trying to force-feed people btc
@_date: 2015-07-06 15:56:21
maybe, just maybe, this sub over the duration of my time subscribed?
@_date: 2015-07-06 15:54:52
are you high? 
@_date: 2015-07-06 15:31:08
in what sense?
@_date: 2015-04-15 23:27:07
Me too, now I'm permanently blacklisted from PP.. What I'd give to be able to use eBay again

I have faith in TouchID being secure, I'd like to see somebody try and bypass it with a sweaty fingerprint from my screen protector (bear in mind the sensor requires a pulse)
@_date: 2015-11-19 18:34:35
I sold key logger access on HF
@_date: 2015-11-23 17:12:26
not sure if or @_date: 2015-11-19 15:18:08
Of course the top comments about something mildly anti-bitcoin here are laughably rage induced
you guys really can't stand any form of criticism can you?
Bitcoin is great, but there's no debating the potential for it's nefarious uses and this one is quite a big one.
This'll be downvoted to fuck, but this sub is so blind at times, who knew a currency could have a new level of fanboyism?
@_date: 2015-11-19 17:05:37
I pay for a seedbox monthly with bitcoin
This is the only use of Bitcoin I have
Never have I entered my name at any stage
Anonymity 
@_date: 2015-11-23 21:38:46
Right? This sub has almost become a crypto currency parody forum 
@_date: 2015-11-19 18:44:23
It'd be a pain but it still doesn't magically remove the anonymity from a crypto currency
