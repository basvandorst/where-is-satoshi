The cost of double spends due to an unsafe chain (as any chain that underhashed would be) would outweigh the gains of having control over the protocol. If banks could do this, they would just try to push towards a more centralized protocol, dev and user community be damned. Part of bitcoin's power comes from the fact that it's economically unfeasible to try to control the network.

The problem with that theory is that the NYSE and BoA are unlikely to have a strong hashing power presence. Miners really dictate the future of the network, not those who use it only to transact.

It will be interesting to see the direction that this takes, certainly. I foresee that Banks will act similarly to how they do now with credit/debit payments. I don't really understand the point of banks wanting to find 'some blocks.' This sounds like banks would withhold transactions until they think that they've found a block in which to include all of their own transactions, but that would be horribly detrimental to the ecosystem as a whole.

Or a desire to not endorse a service that doesn't implement core security practices? If you don't give a shit about security or accountability then don't listen to them.
Honestly, Gavin and the other core devs are not some fucking authoritarian police. The issue they are talking about had a 100+ page dev forum discussion on how best to solve it; Circle needs to secure it's users, and if they aren't up to the Core's standards why would they indorse them?

Except that it didn't. If public debate shouldn't happen because of the potential of bullying we should abandon the proposal at hand entirely.

Adding to a discussion isn't hijacking.

This is just fucking idiotic. Look at Ethereum's 3 (THREE) independent implementations for an example of how Bitcoin should operate. Relying on a single client/consensus lib is just plain stupid.
