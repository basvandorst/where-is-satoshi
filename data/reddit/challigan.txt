Up or down?

My current transfer has so far taken 8 working days. Still waiting.
The one before that took 10 workings days.
I've missed out on a lot of profit. I'll not be using Coinbase again after this one.

Or are you saying your moneys already on GDAX?
If so it's on the Market tab. Just put in how much you want to buy

I was going through my emails the other day and found several LocalBitcoin receipts for 10-20 bitcoin in 2013. I went further back and found my MtGox receipts from 2012.... one was for 43btc...
I'm currently hodling 0.15btc 
Makes me feel a bit sick.

Couldn't say how many but I check all day every day.

Might want to read the 'New' tab of the subreddit buddy

Same! :-(

Balls. There's nothing we can do?

GDAX and Coinbase are the same thing. You need to deposit to your Coinbase account first, then use that money to buy coins on GDAX.

Thanks. I read that but I still don't fully understand.
Is that saying that they are not sure what will happen as the decision is dependant on other parties, however I have full control of my keys should I need to export them?

It went though. Too late tho.... HODL!
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:13:42
Looks like it!
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:07:23
Deposit by bank transfer to Coinbase account then buy on GDAX

If I download and install the Core client, what do I need to do after that? Do I send my coins to the address on it or just import my private keys?
Then after the fork will I just automatically get the extra coins?

I'm hoping it dips. Planning to buy 1btc on after payday.

Great, thank you.

I think you answered your own question with that last statement.
If people see BTC going on a bullrun they ditch their altcoins and FOMO into BTC. 
The best time to trade Alts is when BTC has leveled out and gives Alts time to grow.
