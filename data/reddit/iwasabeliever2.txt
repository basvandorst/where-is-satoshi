If you think it's , unsubstantiated you should probably start to look into what's happening a bit more often.  We have a couple of hundred of hard working devs and a few guys out there who want to fuck up everything.  Just out of interest are you still of the opinion that Mike, Gavin and Brian have the best interest of bitcoin at heart?

"However if the maximum blocksize does not increase on-chain transaction fees could easily reach $50, $100 or even $1000+ just to settle something on-chain and give the funds back to PersonA/C."
Congratulations. Your attempt to try and make out that the block size is not big enough is more laughable than any I have heard of to date.  Please make your point on the r/btc channel along with the other nutters.

Another scam exposed. Ready to join the long list of ponzi scams out there looking for donations. Did you donate?

What's the deal.  He doesn't want people to know about the companies he formed in the past?

I read the slack and twitter feeds (almost 150 feeds covering most in the industry).  Ver is pissing off 99% of the guys there.  Gavin and Mike used to the  &amp;  but now Roger is taking the  place.  Some risks there as he has a lot invested in the infrastructure and money talks when it comes to buying followers and marketing his wacky ideas.

I would love to hear what you feel are the downsides for an app. that's not a game but be careful in answering as I've been using it for quite some time now to make and deploy multi-platform apps.

More funny than anything I've read today. Suggest they check out their in house staff first and put them through a few public audited lie detector tests. That should cost no more than a few thousand and then we might start to slightly believe them.

What's Razorcoin?
@_date: 2016-06-30 09:48:48
I am buying and right now I think the future for bitcoin is more positive than it has ever been. There is so much positive news out there once you learn to look past the trolls that appear here suggesting that there are problems that need fixing immediately.  I just bought 2 bitcoins today and now have a daily buy for an every day purchase of 2.

I made a lot of money with Ethereum but am trying to pull out as much as possible right now.  I think soon it will be nothing more than same as the other ALT Coins and I have lost all trust in the developers.  They like me have made a lot of money from Ether and I suspect the latest DAO attack was an attach by someone who was part of the team.  Only an insider could have easily pulled it off. 
@_date: 2016-06-30 08:16:52
Sorry to say this but I think this will happen time and time again.  When will the populace wake up and notice what's happening?
@_date: 2016-06-30 08:18:03
Who are the ones behind this?
@_date: 2016-06-29 15:57:32
Very good to see this and I really hope it helps the community.  I'm a new bitcoin convert and getting more impressed by the hour. 
@_date: 2016-06-29 11:29:43
I just signed up with Circle and it was not complicated. I have a low daily limit but I can live with that for now. Not sure what your problem is. 
@_date: 2016-06-29 15:58:45
Newbie question here.  Can someone explain more about this wallet and what the advantage is.  Hoping your explanation will help the community.
@_date: 2016-06-29 16:19:43
Would like to get some feedback from people who have tried this. I have a friend who would like to do some trading so I'll send your feedback to him.
@_date: 2016-06-29 14:55:09
You mean over priced? I don't think so. 
@_date: 2016-06-30 08:19:14
I guess nobody is forcing you to appear are they?
@_date: 2016-06-29 15:28:29
Bread wallet is implementing BIP75? I was looking into using that but no way I will use it now!
@_date: 2016-06-30 08:20:20
I don't get what he is trying to say. Can someone explain what point he is trying to make?
@_date: 2016-06-29 15:50:40
Can you please share some more details on how you got this for the benefit of others.  Thanks very much.
@_date: 2016-11-26 09:03:04
All this rubbish  coming from the guy who expects to be called Jesus. 
@_date: 2016-11-11 16:59:21
I can see the score so maybe you need glasses :-)

Soon all of those service may well stop working as they become more popular and without on chain scaling. Good luck living off them in the next year, blocks are now almost full. 
@_date: 2017-04-06 12:38:21
Pushing for something as quickly as they are doing and in the way they are doing is not the normal and they are fully aware of this.  Of course nothing to do with them being on the Roger payroll. 
@_date: 2017-04-06 09:22:46
Is this a surprise.  Gavin has been trying to centralize bitcoin for almost two years now. 
@_date: 2017-04-06 12:39:01
The proposal was not submitted in the usual way and I think you are probably quite well aware of this. 
@_date: 2017-04-06 11:40:07
Of course Whale Panda is not a troll so check his post to see why I added the link.  It has a funny picture of the trolls trying to think up what to do. 
@_date: 2016-07-06 06:16:51
I think we'd all be even happy with $755 is 13 days :-) 
@_date: 2016-07-06 06:13:11
Similar problem for me with bank account verification button.  They need to get their web guys to fix some of these problems. I remember almost 9 months ago when I was having problems with bank account validation button and I still have the problem. 
@_date: 2016-07-06 03:03:43
Every paid $3-4 for a Starbucks coffee :-)   I think that's more of a ripoff.
@_date: 2016-07-06 00:58:24
Another FUD post by the Bitcoin Classic team? 
@_date: 2016-07-06 02:55:53
Anyone :-) ?
@_date: 2016-07-06 00:57:40
They're a lot more sensible than the r/btc crowd
@_date: 2016-07-06 03:02:10
A great idea and very funny :-)  That same message should be available as an option on the 1btc coins also. 
@_date: 2016-07-06 06:15:56
They've been a little bit slow lately when it comes to customer service. Perhaps it's because there customer "support" team have been so busy writing articles about block size problems.
@_date: 2016-07-06 10:59:24
No need to answer as they won't.  That's kind of like asking what would you do if they changed the name of bitcoin to bittycoin.  Never in the history of bitcoin has anyone ever suggested changing the limit or the name.

A great interview.  Now waiting to find out if Amanda to tries to sue the Bitcoin Uncensored guys or have the interview censored. 
@_date: 2016-07-06 00:54:20
Sorry but I see very little use in a screen with a number on it.
@_date: 2016-07-06 07:40:13
My post got down voted again :-(  The trolls must be busy.  I guess trolls prefer for everyone to think nothing is happening and for people to be kept in the dark. 
@_date: 2016-07-06 06:28:23
I think you need to explain it's not like the old money they are used to.  Telling them something is 123,456,789 Satoshis will confuse them even more.
