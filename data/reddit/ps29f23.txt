DCA is definitely the most stress free. I would have made way more if I timed the market and dumped like lump sum when Bitcoin was at 3200 this year but timing the market is IMPOSSIBLE. I remember freaking out and panic buying when it broke the 6000 floor last year, and we all know that didn’t work out lol. 
So do DCA. I do it weekly because there are too many fluctuations month to month. If it hits something historically low, and you are cool with losing all of it then dump sum but that’s last chance saloon stuff for me.

I suggest you do some more research into bitcoin. There is no such thing as a bitcoin identity. 
I don’t know which wallet you are using but it looks like you are using an HD wallet. Hierarchical deterministic wallet can generate more addresses than you will ever need and still tie them to a single private key. 
Generating a new address is good for privacy and has no downsides I can think of. You will not lose any bitcoin by creating a new address because you HD wallet “owns” and tracks all the addresses you create with that seed.

“Nothing attached to my Reddit”
Nothing but thousands of posts and comments to identify you with. Good luck with life retard.
Edit: it only took me 3 minutes to find your post of r/Drugs so perhaps you should STFU
@_date: 2019-11-09 14:48:58
Dude you left thousands of clues on Reddit: drugs, DMT, anti-psychotic drugs, pics of your cats/mates, modern warfare. It wouldn’t be too hard for an ambitious thief to ID you. 
You should definitely be more careful, especially after getting bitcoin stolen before. 
Increase your OPSEC before bragging.

How much will that be worth in five years? Ten years?
Also, it takes minutes to create a fresh wallet and be secure.
@_date: 2019-11-09 14:44:47
Oh well looks like someone already got your bitcoin anyway
Good luck retard.

Manually delete all your posts and maybe even start over. Deleting your account leaves your posts online and accessible. 
Do it now.

@_date: 2019-11-09 14:22:58
Congratulations retard you just told the whole internet how much bitcoin you own, where you trade and how you trade. Good luck getting hacked.

It took me minutes to see how “anonymous” OP really is just on Reddit. (Hint: he’s not and he already got some of his coin stolen!). 
People shouldn’t say how much of *anything* they own unless they don’t mind losing it all.

To do that, I’d split 50/50 between both hardware wallets...
@_date: 2019-10-06 08:16:10
Out of curiosity, doesn’t that double your attack surface? It sounds smart and I’m tempted but would like to know more.

Well I would have done the same. If it’s not safe then I’m steering away.

Man I was thinking was localbitcoins could a thing for me but I was already scared of using it.
@_date: 2019-05-15 11:42:56
Can you give me a source for that? There is conflicting information on this topic. I moved to Denmark and was told by PwC that capital gains tax applies every year, regardless of sale. Nothing is said about using Bitcoin as a payment solution. The tax advisor could not answer my question about what would happen in the unlikely event that I were to owe more tax that I could afford without selling.....
@_date: 2019-05-21 08:52:08
Couldn’t you run those same checks on closed source software?
@_date: 2019-05-21 06:21:31
Yeah but spying through the OS is much less likely to happen than through the network to which it’s connected to. Or the online accounts you access. In fact, has it ever happened?
Can you elaborate how an attacker might penetrate an encrypted connection and have my passwords to read my private keys in plain text without me knowing or entering it manually into something shady?
@_date: 2019-05-20 22:29:23
Can you understand the open source code that runs your OS?
@_date: 2019-05-20 19:43:18
Sorry dude but having SMS 2FA might be forgivable but leaving that much coin on an exchange and not securing it with TOTP or a security key is asking for it. Especially if you are working for a crypto firm.
@_date: 2019-05-18 08:37:57
Very simple question: what exchanges do you recommend?
@_date: 2019-05-26 07:08:49
Out of curiosity do you consider LTC and ETH as altcoins? I’m wondering if I should dump all mine for BTC.
@_date: 2019-05-19 08:38:08
What’s the point of buying the dip? I mean you would have to buy enormous amounts for it to make a real difference when selling at local highs right?
Edit: and when it keeps rising, what do you do?
@_date: 2019-05-18 16:10:39
Super thanks mate.
