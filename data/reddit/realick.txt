He is the third richest man in United States and fourth in the world I believe, and you think this is off of a few good decisions? Do you know anything about investing and what buffett has made his money off of? or is it that you have bought and sold a few bitcoins maybe even some alt coins and think you know what your doing. Many other people have pointed out that he doesn’t understand it and that is why he doesn’t invest which is one of the smartest things you can do while investing and takes the chance out of it. The man is more rich than the majority of people in the world could imagine so please refrain from making comments like this it makes you look incredibly stupid and is bad for this whole subreddit.

This is new in the US and to my knowledge other larger banks don’t have this rule in place. I’m not sure why they would choose these restrictions because there seems like many ways in which they are going to lose a lot of business. In example what about all the college students who are on loans and have a job but don’t maintain 1500 and maybe their employer doesn’t offer direct deposit. They are just cutting off all of those customers but maybe I’m missing something.

Depends on how you look at it but if you look at it as an investment you have to set your bottom and top numbers when you get in. If you think it is the next “internet” of technology then hodl until bitcoin gets to a point where it is stable, because I️ would bet in the long run it’ll end above 20k at the very least. But if you are planning on buying and selling short term to make some money you need to have those number set so that you will end up making a profit. If you don’t then to me you are just gambling and you will probably have better odds at the casino at that point.

Lol no. I’m assuming he means core as in the Bitcoin from his main wallet, selling high so he can buy lower which he thinks will be at 11k.

In America at least where I️ live the banks call what your describing as a transaction account as a checking account. At least for me I️ have never used a check and that is the account my debit card is hooked up to. So just replace checking with transaction in the example and it should make more sense.

If you can’t afford a lawyer they will appoint a lawyer to you, this lawyer that they appoint to people who can’t afford their own is called a public defender. I’m confused what you are getting at as having a lawyer is part of your maranda rights, you can decline this but it must be offered to you. This is guaranteed as long as you are a us citizen you are covered by these rights.

You are always entitled to a public defender. As long as your a us citizen. These guys had the money for a more expensive/experienced lawyer so they did it.

Running that node means that the ledger is saved to your hard drive and every time a new block is added that is added to the ledger on your computer as well. It makes it more secure because everyone of those has the same thing copied down so if someone tried to change is on their endand give them self a bunch of bitcoin then the rest of the nodes would know and it would never work. This also makes it more secure because if a government were to go around and shut down all computers running a node or mining then you still have all the others across the world to kept the ledger going, this is key for it to stay decentralized. I’m not sure how mining helps security
