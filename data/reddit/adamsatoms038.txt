I'd be surprised if anyone here had coins before it was $1. I was around when it was under $10 though. Back then it was inseparable from the dark net and those marketplaces. People didn't really buy them as investments like we do now. People bought bitcoin so they could spend them right away to buy drugs online. I never really gave a thought to watching the price. I never in a million years anticipated it would get to where it is today (If I had, I'd be retired already). When Silk Road went down, I sold any remaining coins I had due to irrational panic. Mt gox went down a few months later and I was sure that was the end of bitcoin. It wasn't until about 2016 that I started having the thoughts "Man I should have held on to those coins, I would have made a shit load of money". I thought I missed my chance so I didn't buy any. But, last summer I started being more convinced btc is really starting to go mainstream and it kept coming back after the dips and I have been doing well hodling since then. So yeah that's about it

Color me surprised then. I guess I figured it went above $1 whenever people started exchanging them on the Silk Road and anyone before that got them directly from Satoshi or something lol. Guess I didn't know people traded that early 
Edit:guess I never thought about original distribution either. I think most were mined in the beginning but were there other ways to obtain them?

You can't "restore" a compressed picture. You need to obtain the original. If it was sent through email they may need to change their email settings to allow for larger files or they can try uploading the full resolution to Google drive or something like that
