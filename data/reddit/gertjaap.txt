In the setup that's currently worked out in proof-of-concept, the oracle doesn't make any money. Incentivation of the oracle might still be part of future research.
Theoretically you could also use a n-of-m oracle setup, where you just need a majority to agree (like two out of three), but also that is not part of the current PoC.

There's an added benefit to the contract not being on chain. No one can actually see its existence from the public ledger which, for contracts you don't want to be known to the entire world, is a desirable feature.
The on-chain part of a discreet log contract is, similar to a payment channel, just a 2-of-2 multisig output.

In the contracts this article describes (Discreet Log Contracts), the input that determines how to divide the funds locked in the contract comes from a trusted oracle. Oracles provide the connection between the blockchain and the real world, similar to other smart contract systems. There's (currently) no way around that - you have to trust the oracle will announce the correct value. 
The paper already describes methods in which to mitigate the risk of the oracle not acting in good faith, for instance by using multiple oracles that have to agree (and the participants receiving their respective funds back if they don't). 
MIT DCI is releasing more details on how this technology works and how you could start developing on top of the technology in the coming weeks.
