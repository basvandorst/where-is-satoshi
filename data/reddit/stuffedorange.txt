This is purely my opinion everyone. In order for bitcoin to grow at a healthy rate the price in the video is what we should be looking at to finally reach a new all time high!

What I was trying to say in the video is that the 8000$ price mark for bitcoin is actually good news. This is where the price of bitcoin should be at this point of time. The reason why is in order for bitcoin to stay healthy and not crash, it needs to move up slowly. The fact that we hit the 8000$ price mark and held there and bitcoin stood steady at that price, tells us that there is hope in cryptocurrency. Thanks for your feedback!
