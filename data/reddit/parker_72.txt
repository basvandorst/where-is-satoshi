Localbit was around then and still is... I used it for years, man nothing better than buying bitcoin for $500 when the market was at $425... gotta give them credit though for lasting though , I used them all the way up until last year...

You realize that only means they put the funds in a bank right?

Guys while I doubt the owner of the NYSE is promoting it, there are companies that are doing that sort of thing currently.  [ for example.

He’s 100% right, it’s fine to use wallets like those intermediately but when your not actively moving them store them on a hardware wallet, the only exception would  be  if that coin doesn’t have a hardware solution

I'd disagree, the price is being driven up at this point purely because of speculation.   It's practical uses are primarily facilitating anonymous transactions, for that same reason it can never become a standard for most countries being the AML laws and regulations continue to increase.  Besides illegal purposes it makes no sense to use bitcoin as a currency with so much price volatility or because it keeps going up.  Millions of dollars are being "invested" through peoples IRA, for many this is the "Holy Grail" real life "Easy Money"  it is the exact same structure as a pump and dump.  When a penny stock is shooting up in the market everyone involved talks about how they will spend their fortunes, but when the majority share holders decide to dump their shares, panic sell offs will make it impossible to liquidate.  Greed and buzz is driving up the price, once that dies down ($3000 or $5000 or $10,000 or $25,000 for all we know) and it then begins a retrace-meant and has to hold it's values based of its "fundamentals" the sell off will be colossal.  But it's a hell of a ride right now, I hope people making money are pulling out profits because this ride WILL NOT last forever.... and this play is a tragedy not a romance.

Your saying the actual private keys not on the card? Well then I could be wrong, I guess you make a point There... they’re a kickstarter though, should that be a concern?

Hey I’ll try and translate what everyone’s trying to say here, but aren’t really communicating at all... Bitcoin.com is actually owned by a bitcoin cash agenda based company.  They say it’s a “bitcoin wallet” but from what I’ve read it’s actually all bitcoin cash made to look like bitcoin (the b is the logo is tiled left rather then right) so be careful and double check that. Bitcoin.org is the globally accepted and endorsed bitcoin newbie site.  Smart to check here first, continue to learn and be cautious like you are and you’ll be fine, welcome!

Your not a “broker” you sell gold, like coins and bullion.  Your always going to be bearish on bitcoins right?  What’s your next prediction? If you hit 3, you’ll make some headway I think

Dude they call them cryptocurrency stock exchanges, and say that they’re the same thing as an online wallet. They also say that hardware wallets are vulnerable to hackers and physical damage, not true, sure there was a ledger issue, but that wasn’t a wallet vulnerability it’s a malware virus changing the address on your computer, also you have a 24 word mnemonic in case the device gets lost or damaged...  Also THEY CALLED IT A STOCK EXCHANGE! How could you trust a firm that doesn’t understand the industry to that extent, and yes I also agree with your employee concerns, I’d pass.  It does look cool though
