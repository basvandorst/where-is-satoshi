When I bought in I genuinely viewed it as tossing the money away, same as buying lunch or a new tv. 
It really made learning about bitcoin less anxiety inducing.
However I find stability exciting, a few months back it seemed unlikely to ever hold still for this long.

I can understand that. Your name does indicate you probably don't have to deal with most of fox's BS, being from out of the country.
I just get tired of people shitting all over fox, when most of the other American networks are just as biased, and often more hateful to those they don't agree with. The US is a circus right now.

It's comes down to the fact that we are all on a list. It might be a friends of the government list or a terrorist list. Most likely, we all fall into someones list as an enemy to their agenda. You might be pro-life, or middle-class, or pro/anti religion. You could've given money to charity after a terrorist attack, voted for either major party, voted for a third party, bought drugs online, or maybe you just have kids you want to homeschool.
Any of those things will get you on a list. We dont have that kind of anonymity anymore, and probably never will again.
@_date: 2014-05-18 21:16:33
By definition, the fact that it is at the price it is at at this very moment, means it is the "maximum potential price" that the market will sustain (for this moment).
That's certainly not to say it will never be worth more, but you have to take things one day at a time. Bitcoin is young, but it is growing.

Because they don't need to hype it, reddit is doing a good job getting the word out. A huge percentage of their target audience is in at least secondary contact with reddit.

Coming from the mind of a business student who did something kind of like this:
I had around a grand from student loans this semester, that was going to just lose value in my bank. I have a job, and decided that worst case I lose a thousand bucks and pay out of my paycheck at the end of the semester. I only ended up investing half of it, because that is what I decided I could live with losing (given my income level). 
So I lost some money, but I'm not depressed. I knew this might happen, and I don't see a point in getting scared and running now. 
So are some people really just not emotionally built to handle trading?
@_date: 2013-11-29 03:53:30
Not the same, but it cheered me up a bit :)

Well, in many ways funding a third party is a healthy step from this two party system that I find to be leading the US into a deadend.
Its the same way the people are pushing to move away from MTGOX because there is too much control in one place.
Thats just my humble opinion though.
@_date: 2013-11-30 06:39:17

Yes it is, therefore it is money whether or not it is sold.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:56:02
I remember thinking at first in terms of relation on the USD, and thinking "I only get one btc for 15 bucks?" looking back when I went back to buy again the price had doubled in a day or two. That was before anything got too crazy. Simpler times... You know, 2-3 months ago.
@_date: 2013-11-28 22:56:26
Yeah, I think that's why it was funny.
@_date: 2013-04-16 04:45:39
You could say the same about most of reddit and their politics.

You're totally right, it just seems like the kind of person that would invest cash into seeming air, would either be so wealthy it didn't make a difference,  or savy/lucky enough to make money. Either way, A: lucky (needs the money) or B: savy (cares for what they have).
Either way the whole story seems a little off. Eiher untrue, or in a pretty gray area moral.

Funny story, they were actually taking applications for a new (sql i think) coder to help with website security, and one of the things on the "apply here" page was about compensation, which was to be payed in either BTC or "other" which I can only assume means lots of drugs.
I guess they just do all their work through tormail or something.
@_date: 2013-03-06 16:43:24
Solid points there. I hope someday people can just get their weed without all the legal BS, I've seen too many normal people have their life ruined by the police over a tiny amount of drugs.

If people are foolish enough to take something that has not been proven as fact, then they deserve to make bogus choices and lose their money. My only point was, I see more harm in knowing exactly who he is, then assuming it to be someone and leaving it to an unknown.

It is if your coins costed you more than your real life wallet holds. I really couldn't give two craps if I didn't have any really money invested. I envy those who have 500 BTC from their laptop CPU mining in 2010.

@_date: 2013-04-08 19:15:52
Hate to be that guy, but you don't think Bitcoin is money?
Econ 2020 taught me that money was any article or substance used as a medium of exchange, measure of wealth, or means of payment.
At least that's what my textbook said.
Edit: Why the downvotes? I'm not going to stop being right just because people don't agree.
@_date: 2013-04-29 15:01:57
Worst that could happen? Hey this guy tried to scam me for free product, I should send a specifically engineered virus to his home in a packet of coke for the purpose of killing said customer and his family.
In reality, there is very little realistic danger though as long as you don't try and scam drug dealers that have your name and address.
@_date: 2013-11-15 20:38:46

Makes sense, personally my cold storage is an old laptop that I took the wifi card out of when it burnt out from non stop torrenting. As long as the hardware cannot be accessed through a network I feel like my 30 bucks in BTC are safe.

@_date: 2013-05-30 22:54:50
I agree with everything you're saying. Left to our own devices we can absolutely sustain ourselves in this pattern. 
However if there was theoretically a major economic event in china (say a civil war or a massive bubble within their own economy that pops one day), they would come knocking at doors to collect debts.
That is the only real issue I have with sustainable debt on a macroeconomic scale. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 05:14:12
To clarify, you mean a solution to the issue of people not understanding the viability of BTC as a currency?
@_date: 2013-03-06 15:01:29
tor and sr are both slow as balls. Sr has grown faster than anyone over there would imagine and are not prepared on the hardware end of things. Tor is just slow because no one helps forward traffic.

@_date: 2013-04-08 20:29:52
Thank you for summarizing my point, I'm still a little tired this morning.
As for my user name it was from my days of playing splinter cell and sniper games so try not to take it to literally ;D

I find it funny that people still get downvoted in this subreddit for asking honest questions.

The only reason people would use gold as a currency is if they were investing in it. The type of people who would trade a can of food for a gram of gold just made a great investment for when (and if) the world ever gets its shit back together.
Realistically knowing a basic skill (welding, farming, solar/wind turbine manufacture, etc) is worth more than gold will ever be worth in a situation like that.

I can't imagine there being any one on earth that would put that much away without some sort of recovery system. I can't imagine leaving that much money irrecoverable even if it was totally dirty illegal money.

Glad you pointed that out, online drug dealers have gotten to be real assholes in the last 8 weeks.

Getting around 210 MH/s on a 6850, with normal clock. I'm pretty sure I could get more, but I have almost no idea what I'm even doing.
@_date: 2013-02-28 20:48:55
They could well be a totally legit company, but I really thought more people understood the whole "if it seems too good to be true" principle.
@_date: 2013-04-16 05:19:21
Well now I'm worried.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:36:06
I made the mistake of getting heavy into philosophy in college, and you start to see trends like this everywhere (especially with politics and the media). Life gets strangely depressing when you understand why people do what they do. 
@_date: 2013-11-13 22:20:58
All 10 of those golden karma points. 
@_date: 2013-03-07 16:51:22
I bought at 45. Not even mad, but damn I could have made like 25% on my buy already if I had been lucky.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:47:32
My 350 buck acer does that, if you mess with the built in safe guards in windows, you're gonna meet some solder eventually.
@_date: 2013-01-30 21:47:07
I'll tell you why, because I'd waste my money on reddit gold, and the good old devs at reddit want me to save up for a new bike to ride down to the barber shop every Tuesday. 
Oh, wait, I guess it's not the fucking 1920s. Get with it reddit.  
@_date: 2013-05-30 19:20:12
Of course it won't be repaid, either the economy will fully collapse, or a debtor will try and collect, which could lead to some sort of war with the suborness of government leaders these days.
@_date: 2013-04-16 05:59:54
Well of course, thats like the unspoken rule of reddit; "I'm pretty much right always, and anyone who does not agree is an unspoken enemy, whom I must either argue with, or downvote so others may hear the word of the thing that is right because it is what I think.""
@_date: 2013-11-29 07:29:20
There ya go! :D
@_date: 2013-04-16 04:55:24
Or buy one with all your new BTC!
@_date: 2013-02-20 22:33:15
All this whole bitcoin craze has taught me is why I chose business as a major and not economics.
I'd be dead by 40 if I had this kind of stress as an actual job and not just a hobby. idk how people who actively play the stock market do it.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:10:07
Ahh. Maybe the guy snapped under the pressure.
@_date: 2013-04-08 17:21:21
Cool :) you've made a fair amount already! Welcome the the club!
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:41:10
I don't think there's any reason to look for proof beyond this, only for the reason that by the very use of a pseudonym, the Creator clearly wanted anonymity. I see no harm in people casually accepting that this guy is the best bet on his identity thus far discovered, and just leaving it at that.
@_date: 2013-04-11 03:29:02
LET IT RIDE MUTHAFUCKA

And I doubt that any website would stop accepting them, its not worth removing the BTC interface (which they likely paid to have implemented), they might well be in the group that wants them as an investment.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:51:55
Wait, does etsy really accept btc?
@_date: 2013-04-08 19:17:18
This is worthy of best-of IMO.
Edit: Fuck you guys, you really downvote people for stating an opinion around here? I think I'm done with this subreddit, I have no desire to be a part of it any longer.
@_date: 2013-04-16 05:16:36
I'm pretty sure (being a private company) the closest you could do is use the service. If there is stock in the site (which i doubt) then you could just buy like you would buy stock in apple.
@_date: 2013-04-15 00:00:07
Hey, some churches at least use the ol don't ask don't tell policy.
@_date: 2013-02-20 22:41:42
This would have been really fucking nice like 2 months ago.
@_date: 2013-02-25 13:10:56
If someone controlled that much BTC I can imagine the currency would holy much if any value, so there wouldn't be any profit to be made in hosting an online casino.
Thats my take on the idea anyway.
@_date: 2013-04-12 06:12:45
No ive seen them, i love tropic thunder. I just totally forgot that line until now!
Fucking Robbert Downy Jr. is perfect in that movie.

God, if you get in a fight with them OP, tell them this.

I have lost all libido by age 21, live with my grandma who has cancer and my parents only talk to me because they want me to make them grandchildren. And I bought at 47 last night.
@_date: 2013-02-28 20:46:50
I'm new to all this, but I just bought at 31, I'm not trying to make money like some, but it's all the fun of playing the stock market without putting my name on anything.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:41:28
My understanding is that difficulty is based on global hash rate, meaning it would only drop if people are devoting less system power to mining due to price drop.
Realistically I don't think there will be any change. 
@_date: 2013-07-18 17:34:46
Anyone who has ever had the misfortune to deal with street dealers can tell you that the two often do come hand in hand.
On the Internet a dealer doesn't have to scare a new guy away from any thought of trying to screw them.
That's my take on it anyways.
@_date: 2013-07-18 17:36:53
Dope means cool, weed is cool, dope is cannabis. 
I kid, I kid.

I heard the "This time it's different" in a deep movie trailer voice.
@_date: 2013-11-29 01:27:05
Thanks for the effort, but it's just not the same ; (
@_date: 2013-04-11 03:31:34
I am presently surprised that the wasn't a "rule two of X club" joke made here. Cause that means I get to do it. Or maybe I won't, I haven't decided yet.
@_date: 2013-04-08 20:57:02
Shhhhh... don't jinx it.

I never going to find out unless you actually ask a question, you know, those sentences that end with one of these: ?.

I feel really dumb that this didnt click until now. I always thought the blockchain should be longer than it is.

Seems like turning the animals into food might be the logical progression, but I guess if you want people meat I'm not gonna come stop you.

Keep in mind that a gun can get you food and water if you're the type to hunt.
@_date: 2013-04-16 04:47:39
I'd bet its a bit of both. Either way people are always going to see the drop in a secondary price as opposed to a deflation of their primary currency. 
@_date: 2013-05-06 17:49:07
Sounds like it was a bad bubble tea, not that bubble tea is bad. Cause that stuff is AWESOME when it's done right.
@_date: 2013-02-25 13:31:49
Ah, so if you hold all of it you couldn't bet it on itself... 
I'm a little slow but I got it.
@_date: 2013-05-04 21:32:50
Incriminating as fuck if someone gets their hands on your phone, but awesome idea nonetheless.
@_date: 2013-02-28 22:36:08
I want to see people try and use these to work a pointer in some kind of Esport like starcraft. It would look so intense.
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:40:04
I'm in no way a genius with bitcoin or website management, or haw large scale severs work, but I can't imagine why it would be any different than flipping a hard switch on a server/HDD to make it cold/hot. I'm sure there's more to it, just my thoughts.
