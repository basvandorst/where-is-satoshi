Annnd we're back up once more.

Seriously, that's good advice. Try and forget about them. I've lost quite a bit by paying too much attention and overthinking.

This is why Potcoin is needed.

Hmm. You know, somehow, the thought never occured to me to even look into anything like that. Thank you. I guess I just needed an outside perspective lol. I personally call the place "Summerland".

Yeah Julian702 up above pointed me in to localbitcoins, and I'm seeing now that it's possible to buy less than I previously thought. However, thanks to your post, I see that the "playing field" is a little more leveled with bitcoins than I thought just an hour ago :)

TMBG? *clicks link* SUCCESS!!!

I know they have been having low supply issues, and it does take a few days to process, but coinbase allows you to choose less than 1 bitcoin. I just figured this out myself last week.

We need more images like this one around here explaining things.
@_date: 2013-02-12 22:34:08
Whoa. Thank you too!!!
@_date: 2013-02-12 15:30:26
That's kind of what I'm trying to do here. Long term, if I can't get this car working soon, I'm going to run out of money. So I'm trying to convert some of what I have now just to keep me going a little bit longer.

You haven't heard of the Bit Bang Theory?

I used my Credit Union.

See, i think taxing land is horrible. I have acres that I don't ever set foot on. The only reason why I won't sell it is because I'm afraid someone will do something with it. The land is in the exact same condition as it was when the native americans were in control. I know it's been in my family for at least 150 years without being touched. Last estimate, there was about 8 mil in coal underneath it as well. I could be a millionaire instead of unemployed, but I refuse to destroy the earth. So I pay taxes for something that I'm preserving for all the future generations. It's **crap**. Sorry to go off topic, I just needed to vent.

Seriously, that's awesome! LMAO. Don't underestimate the power of mTurk though, it's paying me more than any other job I've had in my 18 years of working. It's just not enough to pay the bills AND get ahead. 
@_date: 2013-02-19 02:51:45
Just do what I did. I bought one whole bitcoin so in case it doesn't drop, I at least got in a little. If it does drop, then I'm gonna buy a few more. If it just keeps going up, well, I don't know what I'm gonna do then lol.
@_date: 2013-02-12 14:28:11
Honestly, yeah, they are expensive to me right now. I'm stuck in the spot where I can only mTurk for work (tree fell on car, insurance refuses to pay, bought new car, it died a week after, been unemployed 7 months now because of it, too far out to walk to work anywhere). 
Now, I know I'm not the current targeted audience because of my situation, but when I asked that question, I wasn't necessarily thinking of myself, as I am aware that there are still people that have it worse than I do. I was just thinking that if I can't afford it, I know they can't. Also, in all fairness, I haven't seen a place that lets you buy less than a whole bitcoin either.
@_date: 2013-02-12 14:39:43
I realize that the currency is of equal value when I purchase it. The thing is I can't find a place where I can purchase less than a whole bitcoin. I can't get out to buy a moneypack [SP], so the only option I really have (that I've found anyway) is to use coinbase and tie it into my bank account. If there's a better way, I'm totally open to suggestions!!
@_date: 2013-02-12 16:33:29
Oh wow. Thanks for the clarification on that.
@_date: 2013-02-12 14:34:02
Interesting. Thank you for clearing that up for me.
@_date: 2013-02-12 14:10:31
Ok. Yeah, I'll admit, I've only been doing this for about a week, so I'm still learning. It's just been frustrating, because I've been waiting (hoping) for them to drop just enough that I can get my first full coin, yet the price just keeps going up on me! XD
So, while I'm typing... can anyone tell me if there are a limited amount of spaces after the decimal point, or will that number just keep expanding the more users there become?
@_date: 2013-03-15 18:22:31
Why not? If they deem it illegal, doesn't that mean they are in possession of it, therefore making them guilty of whatever law(s) they pass?
@_date: 2013-03-19 15:07:38
I tried mining for a couple of weeks. With my GT550, I was making about .02 cents a day. Totally not worth it in my opinion. Leave it for the big dogs.
@_date: 2013-02-12 14:53:00
Awesome. Thank you!
@_date: 2013-03-19 15:21:09
I did not know that. Thanks.
@_date: 2013-02-12 15:21:17
Thank you so very much!!

I think I picked the worst time to jump on this bandwagon. At $25 a bitcoin, it puts them outside of my realm of affordability, so I'm just scraping up whatever I can find on the free bitcoin sites. 
It making me think a lot about the currency it's self however. In order for bitcoins to be widely accepted, more people need to use them. The more people that become involved, the more likely the chances are of them being from poorer demographics. If the poor can't afford BTCs, and the poor is the majority of the people, how exactly are BTCs supposed to stay afloat? It seems to me that they just keep getting further and further out of reach.
