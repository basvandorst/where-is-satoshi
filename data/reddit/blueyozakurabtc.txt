Monero is 0.04 as I just tried to transfer out the 0.05 I transferred in because I thought eh maybe I should wait. I already paid 0.02 to get it in there in the first place so it appears I'm at a loss unless I send them more which will equal fees coming in and going out.

So after my first month as an affiliate well they didn't payout most of the people that I've chatted with in groups. I only saw one person that received full payout for their conversions. The rest all complained about receiving only 15-20% of what they converted. I'm actually in shock and several friends and family all were burned by this company. I just can't even believe it. One person earned $1600 in affiliate conversions and only received $300. Another did $1000 in affiliate conversions and receive $200.  Payout dates kept changing first it was the 1st, then received 1st-5th then it became the 3rd to the 7th. I was also told the bitgold card wouldn't be out for a few months but once everyone saw their balances didn't make sense that's when it was being offered here in the states. 
Just this week I noticed they're running their own 20 sec spots on youtube. 
They don't accept btc in the states at this time as the btc wallet option is disabled.

I signed up and have been promoting BitGold like crazy. I love their affiliate program as you're paid $35.25 per sign up ( depending on country IP). Tried to introduce a few fellow cam models but everyone is just staring at my post lol. I've gotten sign ups from facebook mostly in at home work groups. I"m just trying to find out how do you reach out to other people? 
100 sign ups in certain countries and you're earning a nice $3500 a month (in USD or in gold).

hahha! I always wondered why they jumped around with characters like this. I thought it was a way for each individual woman to stand out among the masses that post.

I don't think prostitute is the term as the posts show up in escort or body rub locations. Escorting isn't illegal prostitution is which is why ads specify time not what's actually performed once both parties are behind closed doors.

It's probably going to be considered Pimpcoin soon or Bitpimp.
