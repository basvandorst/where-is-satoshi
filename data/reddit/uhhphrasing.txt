I did my taxes at H&amp;R Block in 2013 because I didn't know how the bleep to do Bitcoin.  She filled out a form 8949.  According to their website, Credit Karma supports this form.  I have yet to find it though...
@_date: 2018-01-28 02:52:06
Though form 8949 might just be to help you fill out schedule D... they also allegedly support schedule D.  Still haven't found either.  I've been looking for like an hour for my own.

The first one has a reserve of 2000 btc.  It's really not hard to follow 1000 being mixed in 3000.  The second one, again, probably only works with small amounts.  We're talking $600k+.  It's going to raise flags any way you try to liquidate it unless you do it in small amounts over years.

I think it was a different part of his body from which he pulled it.
@_date: 2014-07-24 14:49:34
I think it would depend how it got stolen.  For example, if someone robs a bank, I don't lose my money.  But if I take cash out of an ATM and someone jumps me, I don't think I can file a claim with the FDIC.  
So it's only insured if it's their error.  Presumably the insurer has done code audits to determine the risk.  
@_date: 2014-08-22 23:47:07
That's some impressively bad customer service.  I don't even work in support, but if someone somehow complained directly to me about my company's product telling me they've been waiting a week, I would do something for them.

Even talking about inflation is ridiculous.  It's just about the weakest factor affecting the price of bitcoin.  If I could sell or buy $1 million in bitcoin right now it would affect the price more than the bitcoins that will be mined today.

A typical consumer wouldn't hold bitcoin, they would simply use it as a transaction mechanism.

I probably would have agreed with you a few months ago.  But suddenly my credit card is having unauthorized charges once a month.  It's a huge pain in the ass.  I got hit with a late charge for my gym because I forgot to change it to my new number.  
The first time the unauthorized charge hit, I changed half of my bills to use PayPal.  The next time, I moved the ones that didn't have that option to use ShopSafe numbers (which means I will have to periodically update them).  Stress, phone calls, money, I've had enough.  
I'm not saying Bitcoin is better than a credit card, but for the love of God, they could learn SOMETHING from it.  
@_date: 2015-01-31 14:53:40
It is kind of silly to compare the USD and bitcoin though.

I always wonder how they plan on liquidating them.  If I were to steal a thousand btc, what the hell would I do with it?  Send it to Coinbase?  That's probably obvious right?  Buy stuff on AmagiMetals?  Same problem.  Buy drugs?  Yeah I'm sure a drug dealer wouldn't sell me out.

Won't blocks always be found faster than every 10 minutes (on average) if the difficulty is adjusted to average only 10 minutes?  Since the instant it's adjusted any increase in network power brings the average lower, right?

So if I buy a brand new miner of some sort, it will pay for itself and then some?  
If I buy the asicminer USB 330 mh/s for $20, it will never pay for itself.  
If I buy the 60 gh/s butterfly labs for $190, it might become profitable after 6 months or so, but who knows.
I just don't see any scenario that is "wildly profitable".

I feel like there isn't much room for "implied" things in the bill of rights. That's a power that the court has and you don't. That said, I think we're moving in different directions of a "right".  Are we talking about a human right (perhaps what Snowden is talking about?) or a right explicitly afforded by the constitution (what is talking about)?

They basically said in the email to hire a lawyer your damn self and contest it.
@_date: 2018-02-23 23:01:50
I'm one of them.  I don't really understand it.  What are they providing that the IRS doesn't already know?
@_date: 2018-02-24 15:50:20
The email says so. They even made it bold.
@_date: 2018-02-24 19:45:33
My question was whether we did something wrong, not whether we maybe did something wrong. 
@_date: 2018-02-24 02:50:20

I think the idea is that if any reasonable person wanted to buy a bunch, they probably wouldn't just do a massive market buy.  They would probably buy a little at a time and let it settle between each buy so as to not overpay.  I wouldn't call it "obvious" but it's certainly a viable theory.
