thanks!  I am sure the OKCoin shill army is getting paid a lot to down vote this thread just about now.  It was up to 10 votes quickly, then now back down to 1 vote. lol

I think it just means on May 14, Star suddenly "would" NOT "accept" v7.  But it is absolutely clear OKCoin (Jack Liu) had v7 and have been discussing it at least since Feb 23.  And Star have been using v7 for discussions at least from May 14, if not earlier.

If you look at the transcripts closely, you can see Star tried to make it look like CZ forged the contract.  Luckily, CZ uses digital signatures.  And what motives would CZ have to forge that contract.


6 months is lot better than 54 months remaining on the contract.  
If you read the transcripts carefully,

    ... I remember I have told changpeng we should have the power to  stop the contract in one month just like the power you have.
So, he did try one month first. Probably figured that would look too suspicious.  Then went for 6 months.  
Now this email is dug up.  In that same email, Star says:
    But it is very strange why the contract is not what I can accept!
So, **Star did see the contract on May 14 at least.**  In a later email, he claims he didn't see the contracts until 5.19.  **Star's lie caught again**


It has to be forged as signed by CZ, as he signed the original contract.  Pinning forgery on an ex-employee who he still owes money to, and has no intention to pay, seems like a convenient thing to do.  For all I know, CZ may already have a lawsuit against Star, maybe less publicly.

On May 14, Star should be looking at v7 of the contract.  One day earlier, on May 13, In Roger email, he explained there is "55 months remaining, and OKCoin owes $550,000".  
If Star is looking at v8, then the immediate response should be, we can cancel "givin" you 6 months notice, and only owe you $60,000.  Or where does the 55 month come from?
So, v8 did not exist, even on the OKCoin side, as late as May 14th.  And Star at least saw v7 on May 14, not May 19 as he claims.

Say CZ signed a bad deal.  It looks like the bigger moron is Jack Liu.  In Feb, Jack said he represented OKCoin, reviewed and agreed to the contract and decided to continue.  This is after OKCoin have had the site for 3 months, and knows there was 0 ad revenue (either deliberate or not).

    Roger,
    We are confident we can build Bitcoin.com up over the coming 6 months 
Good or bad deal aside.  We can safely assume CZ didn't take a bribe.  Or Roger would have to bribe both CZ and then Jack to get the deal to continue.

I don't think Roger cares to take this to court.  The contract have no legal jurisdiction.  But more importantly:
Roger has more than achieved his goal, punishing OKCoin beyond what's owed to him and revealing OKC is a bad player to the community.
This is actually a decent example of how a libertarian society without courts would work.  
OKC clearly lost a heck of a lot more than $20,000 USD in reputation and long term damages.
Roger lost his $20,000 plus a bit more in down time of the site.  But to go to court, he needs to get lawyers, sort out evidence, notarize them, go to Singapore, pay for flights and hotels, attend court (maybe a few times), and be tied up for days of his personal time.  It's just not worth it.  In a dispute, both lose.  
But Roger walked away with dignity and OKC walked away a world-known liar.
Lesson for OKC is simple, PAY PEOPLE ON-TIME first, (then ask to renegotiate if you have to)!  And don't try to fk people, even on a non-enforceable contract.  A contract is a contract.
Welcome to the bitcoin world!  Actually, OKC is not welcomed anymore.

I think OKCoin have the most to lose in these type of public debates.  Roger Ver is a multiple millionaire already, have complete financial freedom and does not depend on anyone else.
OKCoin on the other hand, have a brand reputation to maintain.  Competitors to deal with, trying to win customers over them.  This type of public dispute does not help them at all.
And Star Xu is (was) an upcoming entrepreneur with great potential.  He needs credibility to deal with future round B investors, lead a team, etc.  Now, he's totally destroyed his own credibility.  Everyone thinks, or knows, Star is a liar.  Not very smart of them.
I think this is a classic case of people's egos getting in the way and clouding their judgement for what's materially best for themselves.  They should both act as adults, let go of their egos and settle this privately.  Or option B,  get real lawyers and go to court.  But this contract doesn't specify a jurisdiction, which doesn't give them much hope for this option.
