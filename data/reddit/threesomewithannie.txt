Their support is truly awesome. They all seem very dedicated. Can absolutely vouch for them.

Just for completeness: this is an Austrian newspaper, not a German one (though the language is German).

Yes, that's what Satoshi called it *six years ago*. This was a long time ago. Meanwhile though, Bitcoin has changed it's vision. Read the recent press releases about Lightning and Liquid, Bitcoin gets explicitly called *settlement layer* there. When those products are ready, poor people won't have any problem sending their cents around. And paying for coffee won't be a problem either.

Blockstream is going to leave all the code open-source. So I don't see a problem there.

Yes, poor people *are* spam. If they can't afford 15c per transaction they just shouldn't use Bitcoin, plain simple. It's a settlement layer and not a P2P electronic cash system.

Which bank are you talking about?

*Miners already do decide*. They can choose between voting for 1MB and 2MB blocks (Classic) and the results are there for everyone to see. Deal with it.

You don't get banned for the truth.

Bitcoin protocol is not made for cents being shoved around. If 4th world people really want to use Bitcoin, they should wait for Lightning/Liquid to be ready. But spamming the settlement layer definitely won't help.

redditor since 1 day... yeah sounds legit 
@_date: 2016-02-29 21:06:55
The 4th world can join in when the appropriate products are ready. Spamming the settlement layer with $2 transactions just doesn't make any sense. But soon enough fees will be 30c - 40c so those people will stop spamming anyway.

RBF is ready soon, so stuck transaction will be history. Easy and elegant solution to the whole problem.

I am pretty sure they will figure it out. Core has the best and most experienced developers around, especially compared to other implementations where newcomers like Jeff and Gavin can give their experimental hacks a try.

Bitcoin is for the average user. Average users don't send 40 cents around. Microtransactions are great and will be widely used once Lightning and Liquid are ready. Until then, those people need to stop spamming their cents around. Gladly, fee is steadily increasing so the incentive for broadcasting these garbage-transactions decreases over time.
A healthy fee is 30c-40c, so still much much cheaper than Visa, but costly enough to add more value to sidechains.

I don't see any problems. Most of the backlog is due to spam. People need to add higher fees to their transactions and complain less.

Investments into Bitcoin companies are good for the whole ecosystem. We should be glad that Blockstream is around, not spread weird conspiracy theories.

It can. And it probably will. Just wanted to hedge with this post. If I lose money due to a huge drop, at least I was right in a reddit post.
EDIT: Thats why I sometimes bet money against my favourite team at football matches.

I am also from Austria and can confirm. Pretty sick that you managed to license that. Congratulations and best of luck. BTW, what fees are you charging? And do you plan to create an exchange platform in some point in the future?

The comments I found are from May 2009 which is almost a year earlier. They are not that exciting though, just sharing links, so I didn't include them in my post.
