I would very much like an answer to this before I pull whatever I have on Coinbase too.

I don’t think I’m grasping the point of the article as well as I should but, it seems they’re saying BTC is behaving like a stock and stocks move up and down aggressively if they’ve been following a trend in the opposite direction. Not too sure how I feel about this. I’d love to hear any other interpretations.

I’ve tried exploring that option, what’s ironic is I invested in AMD stocks before Bitcoin became a consideration for me. I had a feeling they would have done well this year. Before I knew it, I had accidentally put all my eggs into one basket.
Right now I plan on keeping it at a 40-60 split with BTC but, I agree, it’s a bad idea. I do plan to slow down in the near future.

I was perfectly comfortable dropping the money for the semester in, it was already spent in my head. I do, however, have reservations about about putting any more disposable income in just as some of the other users have suggested. And now that I’ll be free from the binds of school, I do see myself slowing down the pace upon the close of the semester. 
I’m actually very excited about adopting bitcoin as a currency and putting it to use. It’s hard for me to wrap my mind around it’s use, exchange, etc. to a point where I’m comfortable with exchanges. I like to know what I’m doing. I’m also a strong believer in learning on the job so, I may have to lose some before I grasp it. 
Come December, I will have a BS in Civil Engineering from a private institution in NYC. I’ve lived below the poverty line for so long, having the extra cash sitting around doing nothing actually bothered me haha. My student loans are well below $30k. Hardly anyone in the family including myself had a credit history old enough to get approved for a good loan at the time of application. Most of it was just paid for through scholarship, aid, and odd jobs I could find doing tech work. Figured I’m in a comfortable position to invest.
