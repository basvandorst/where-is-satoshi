Yup, she's a keeper, on account'a she's bonafide.

But it was on Kraken at the time of the fork.  And what do you mean leave out an L?

Patience padawan, patience. These be mad times we're living in, mad I tell you! But you should be just fine my friend.

It's only two passes looped. But good reference. Lol

Did it to me two days ago. You'll get it. It took about an hr or so after success. Could be longer. But it will be there sooner than you fear. Take courage.

Money, so overrated. Its our own fault if we are doing what makes us unhappy. No-one should be in crypto unless the entire ride is fun to them, not just the ath but the dips as well. And the dips doubly so because it's the dips that edify our communities the best. It's ALL good. Every bit of it! The mountain tops are nice but the valley is where everything grows. And the best thing is, once bottom is reached, the only place to go from there is a new mountain top! I'd lace up if I were you. We are breaking camp very soon!

No, god. And if I took the btc off kraken after the fork, do I still recieve the same amount of god as I had in btc on kraken when it happened? If so, how do I get it or see it on kraken?

Only thing (real estate) they aren't making more of??? Tell that to Dubai.

How do I get a god wallet on Kraken? I don't even see a (GOD) on kraken anywhere to even be able to trade.

It's not even ok to talk about it.

That was just a tremor, the earthquake is going to hit in a minute. "DONT GIVE UP THE SHIP!" we are all here for each other. Remember why we started. Pop out them hulk muscles and let's get under this thing and lift it past the sky! Forget the moon! Let's send this baby to Orion! Remember, if your going to fight using either bitcoin or love as your weapons in this life you have to be willing to lose...temporarily.

When banks open today I think it will be a buying frenzy this time, not a sell off. We have all been doing a good job informing people lately and I think we are going to see a turn in the general publics opinion on dips as being a bad thing. Their learning.

I actually googled mod and a crypto came up. Actually looked pretty good too. Can anyone tell me not only what a mod is so I can get the joke, lol, but also, does anyone have any knowledge of this mod coin I stumbled on?

Just make sure your playing with house money for one. And also remember that it is only money. If your life is interrupted by all of this than you are most certainly doing it wrong. And for the love of bitcoin go buy something with your coin. Don't sit back in panic, go out and spend in happiness and do something to edify the coin and it's community. Quit sweat'n this stuff, it's effective at keeping us from enjoying what we have created. Take courage and pleasure in it. Don't ruin the experience for yourself or others. Don't miss all the fun of your child growing up just because lifes temporarily imperfect or hard. This child is going to keep suprising us and bringing us happiness, you just watch.

If I was face to face with you I would pay you 20 dollars just so you could keep it on there for yourself.

Fear less. Buy more.

So glad I stayed up last night and got a feel for the morning market. I was like an expecting father waiting for the bank to open up this morning. In traffic like, "Must go faster!  Must go faster! Must go faster! Lol. Made it back home to buy all the dips! 100% all in today and I'm ..."feeling good Lewis! "
