Why the hell does my USD ATM charge me $2.00 if I even check my balance?  Why am I limited to $250 per withdraw, and they charge me $3 every time?!?  What if I want to withdraw $2,000?  I have to pay the fee 8 times?
The fact is that a group of real Bitcoin believers have decided to do something.... from one side, we list on LocalBitcoins.com.  On the other, we may risk our safety by listing on sites like craigslist.org.
The amazing thing is that the BTC market is like, well, every other market, ever.  People are willing to pay for convenience and security.  If you are willing to risk either of those parameters, you can get a better deal.

I don't plan on carrying the device around with me day-to-day.  I do plan on keeping it in a safe.  But I keep the rest of my BTC in cold storage in a safe deposit box.  If I want to buy something for between USD 0-1000, I can use coinbase / blockchain / Bitcoin-QT.  Up to $5000, go open my safe and get the Trezor.  Over $5,000?  Go to my safe deposit box during banker's hours, and retrieve a private key.

I do control them.  The trezor uses [a deterministic wallet]( which means that as long as I have the seed, I can recreate the entirety of my private keys without the physical device.

If you have a way to communicate a shared secret, such as a code phrase, via telephone, etc.  Then you can have the desired recipient create an address, sign the shared secret, and then e-mail you both the address and signature, but not the actual shared secret.

Mining is a great way to supplement your entry into the Bitcoin economy.  You can "buy" bitcoins in a number of places, but by and large, they have some way to tie the transaction back to you.
By mining, you are completely anonymous.  It's not a huge deal, but if you are buying and selling goods instead of currency, it's a great way to save your fiat currency.

No, this is the side effect of BTC not being a US phenomena.  Coinbase works with merchants, traders, etc.  to try to balance both the buy and sell sides.
At this point in the [S-Curve]( the buyers far outweigh the sellers, and Coinbase is caught in this trap.  This is not in itself a bad thing.
TL;DR:  Coinbase is suffering from an imbalance of transactions.  Given the volume of their merchants, I would imagine this is a temporary issue.
@_date: 2013-11-20 04:56:39
I agree!  The problem, as I see it, is that online wallets send their change back to the original address, instead of sending them to a new, different, and random, address.
Had I processed this transaction using the Bitcoin-QT client, I could have never double spend.

That makes sense, but it seems that to do that, you should consider the entirety of the mining pool.  At the point that block 266975 had been found, it had been more than 27 minutes since block 266974.

It is [currently fantastically hard]( to solve a block.  What happened here is that two people who are using [Slush's pool]( submitted valid solutions within 5 seconds of each other.  Statistically, across the entire Bitcoin network, all of the workers **combined** should take 10 minutes to solve a block.  To have 2 different workers on the same pool, submit 2 valid solutions to the current block, within 5 seconds of each other is quite rare.

Imagine you have a BTC 1 bill.  You buy a widget that costs BTC 0.75.
Because of the way that Bitcoin works, you are required to spend the entire BTC 1 you have.  But you don't want to pay BTC 1 for the widget.
So what you do is ask the seller for their address.  You craft a transaction that pays that address 0.75.  But if you don't specify a place to send the other 0.25, it will be gone forever!
Your local wallet doesn't want that money to go away, so when it creates the transaction, it says "Hi, I have 1 bitcoin!  I have to pay this guy 0.75.  Since it isn't a full 1 bitcoin, here is the address that you should send my 0.25 change, thanks!"

This is actually brilliant advice.  You should do a "dry run" of something like 0.001 coins using whatever process you choose, and then go through the process of recovering those coins.
I love vanitygen for what seems to be an odd reason... there isn't a randomly seeded PRNG.  You can test it on the main blockchain for pennies, and when you specify your desired firstbits, the vanitygen client will bruteforce it, but not sequentially.
But paulej is right... TEST, TEST, and more TESTS should be applied to any long-term solution you select!

+1 This.
I have one on order, and the maths behind it are sound.
If you don't want to pay that much, you should use a client-side web wallet generator.  I'll not endorse any single vendor, but they all work in the same way.
TBH, If you are using the Satoshi client, you should be fine.  It does things the "right way" as described in the [original Satoshi paper](
TL;DR:  If you have hundreds or thousands of coins, for heaven's sake, stick them in [cold storage](
Personally, I have 3 wallets.  My web wallet that contains a trivial amount of BTC (maybe 5 BTC at the most).  My desktop which runs an encrypted Ubuntu instance that holds maybe 30 more, and the rest are in cold storage in my safety deposit box.
Risk is unique to each person.  I'm less concerned because most of my coins are from the early days of mining, so I didn't actually pay USD100+ for each one.  But I am not an idiot.  The best advice I heard is that you wouldn't walk down the street with more than a couple hundred dollars... so should it be with Bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-10-25 04:44:09
Because when you use the QT client, when you send coins, the QT client sends the amount, but if there is change, it returns them to an address that is in your control and in your wallet, but not publically displayed.
Web wallets like blockchain.info deliberately send change back to the original address, but Satoshi is smarter than us, and set up the QT client process for a number of reasons.

However, recent interest involving virtual currency and its exchanges has created uncertainty and confusion around virtual currency, and Dwolla's relationship with a small number of its exchanges. This has forced Dwolla to reassign resources, funds, and services. 
As Dwolla gears up for a new stage of growth, we recognize that we can no longer sustain this merchant base (.1 percent of Dwolla merchants) and its unique needs, and that attempting to do so jeopardizes both of our communities' starkly different, but similarly ambitious, vision for improving payments. 
Effective October 28, 2013 at 4pm CT, Dwolla will be withdrawing its service offerings to virtual currency exchanges and virtual currency related services.
What does this mean?
Your account, and its functionality, will remain unaffected. However, you can deactivate your account from within your Dwolla dashboard, if you so choose.
Dwolla aims to provide its users and the few affected merchants with the guidance necessary to ensure a smooth transition. To do that, we encourage users to over-communicate with our support team, report any suspicious activity, and revisit our terms of service to ensure uninterrupted services.
What is the timeline of events?
October 10: Only existing users with a 30-day history with Dwolla will be able to send funds to merchants affected by this change.
October 15: Affected merchants will be limited to sending money only, and will no longer be able to receive funds from customers. They will be able to issue refunds to customers at this time.
October 28: Affected merchants’ accounts will be suspended. No further activity will be provided.
October 29: Provided no security or fraud concerns, Dwolla will transfer any of the remaining funds inside the affected merchant's Dwolla account to its linked bank account.
The decision to remove anyone from the network -- no matter the circumstances -- is not something Dwolla takes lightly. We are grateful for the opportunity to service and learn from these users. We wish the community and its pioneers the best.

I decided to repost this because I believe it is VERY important for us, as a community, to reward and call out companies that trade in Bitcoin and actually deliver.
I apologize that my purchase overshadowed a great player in the BTC community.
@_date: 2013-08-30 05:49:04
Meh.  As long as I get my two 60Gh units before then, I'm cool.
@_date: 2013-12-13 06:51:56
Look, we all know that is a circlejerk.  But if you honestly, really, and truely want to hate on BTC people, then do me a favor.
Create a blockchain.info or a coinbase.com wallet.  Get your public key, and post it here.
I'll fund it with no less than 0.10 BTC.  And then say farewell.  You can choose to sell it, buy gift cards, whatever.
As long as you post the address publically, anyone can verify that I chose to follow through with this fun request.

Actually it was "Shut the fuck up, Donnie"
Kidding.  It has to do with a specific recipe our grandmother used when cooking for us.

Yep.  Just don't go around with $40,000 in you wallet.

Litecoin is cheaper, which means that there will, at least in the short term, be many more participants.
So, if you are trading short term, LTC will outpace BTC.  But if you are in this for the long haul, LTC will swing and crash decades before BTC will.
PSA:  I own a lot of both BTC and LTC.  Whichever goes up, I win.  Please consider my advice to be COMPLETELY self-serving without a care in the world about YOUR investments.

I know, but how do I tell her safely in English to "go to this site, input your info, and then you magically have more than 2800 Yuan"?
I don't want to put her in trouble.

Because unless my relatives have any idea about how Bitcoin works, it wouldn't be easily found.

Oh, no worries!  Nobody can completely keep up.  I apologize if my message came across as bullying.
Actually, most of the **PHYSICAL** coins have now are from buying them back from my co-workers... the cheapest was $15, and the most expensive was $400.  Only my business partner refused to sell his back to me, instead he keeps it in his safety deposit box!
edit:  Specify that physical coins != wallet coins

Yay! The other day, I got Gavin to reply to me, and now Marek!  I feel so special!

Can you offer larger sizes than ~3 oz?  Also, some different, maybe regional brands would be ideal.

Gavin replied to my comment!  I can't wait to get you to sign my PGP key in person!
I know that, but I was trying to demonstrate that any DoS attack via the negotiation vector can be defeated.
That being said, I'm a huge fan!

I'm not familiar with Dropbox's unlimited backup retrieval service, but as long as you have encrypted the file with strong encryption, you should be fine.
I would also recommend that you store the encrypted wallet on some kind of local external media that you can give to a trusted friend or relative.
@_date: 2013-10-25 03:39:06
You are right.  It was the longest 9 hours of my life waiting for the blockchain to re-download.
It is a LOT OF MONEY, and this taught me a valuable lesson, which is why I posted in the first place.
I use BTC every day for a lot of things (see my post history), so I honestly didn't think too much about how things can go wrong.
The other takeaway is that there is no good reason to keep more than 20 or so BTC in a hot wallet.
@_date: 2013-10-31 03:29:40
Oh, and sorry for the fantastically oversized screen shot... I was looking at it on the [4k monitor that I apparently didn't buy using Bitcoin](
@_date: 2013-10-31 02:26:17
If you are trading exclusively in bitcoin, signing and verifying using a Bitcoin address is fantastically easy, and doesn't require you to exchange keys with the recipient.  If they want you to send them X BTC, have them sign a request with the details.

Don't worry about the downvotes.  There are people who downvote everything posted in this subreddit.  Some people will even go through your comment history and downvote your other posts too.

I created a brain wallet that, when read by either of my brothers, would make sense, but to everyone else, would be gibberish.  I also explained to them how to create the private key using sha256sum from a command line.
And I am no longer worried about what happens to my stupid wallet.dat file!

I did the same, and actually got a couple of messages.  Not worth it for the money, but worth it as a way to spend BTC on something mainstream.

I saw that, but Amazon actually had a "dented box" model that hadn't been opened for around $2800, that they were selling via their warehouse deals account.  It may be technically used, but because it was sold by Amazon.com, Squaretrade will warranty it as new.

No worries!  I've been playing with the house's money in BTC for years.  I wish you would have been around 3 years ago, then we would both be enjoying this odd reality.
The only thing I might suggest is that, if you are used to being corrected via typos and grammar, that you chose to utilize your fortune to invest in language and grammar classes.

Double-checked the address, but you make a good point... MtGox is involved, and they are probably dealing with just a few issues right now. :-)

Most recent games will scale up.  I happen to have 3x7970 GPUs configured in Crossfire mode in my gaming PC, courtesy of my GPU mining days, so I figured why not see what they can do? :-)

I simply backup the wallet, then encrypt it using gpg, then store it in the cloud(tm).  You can use any cloud provider once it is encrypted.  I also have created 2 USB keys encrypted with TrueCrypt, that has all of my private keys, and gave one to my mother, and one to my brother, in case something happens to me.

Yes.  All that electrum is doing is calculating the SHA256 sum of whatever your passphrase is... for example, let's use your comment.  The SHA256 of your comment is af38ee494eeedd49b91d05f368211c97bf6cecabc37e014a2183b66b55e34670.
You would use that as the seed, and you could recover whatever coins used in the wallet with or without Electrum.

But I'm really curious as to how this happened, and what it means.

If you choose to trade locally, FFS, only trade with people who have a great OTC rating, or have a long history on localbitcoins.com.
I've had numerous transactions complete via localbitcoin, and have never had a single problem.  I always make sure to trade in a local place, that is open and in the air (read: mall, wal-mart, or Pandora)
If you are concerned, bring along a shill.  In my case, I bring along my brother, who has worked as a bouncer at some of the hottest clubs in Atlanta.  He's never once been bothered to leave his bagel and coffee.
PM me if you want proof of my involvement with LocalBitcoins.
@_date: 2013-11-24 04:11:50
