Unnecessary mixing of hard asset types.  It only confuses future transactions for no additional value returned. Not recommended but no harm. Gimmick.

Here's the solution I use.
On a bi-weekly basis I do the following:
* Transfer in $x of USD paycheck to CampBX via Dwolla
* Buy coins with Spend-X (delay if volitility is high)
* Withdraw purchased BTC via BTC transfer to Mt.Gox
* [wait 50 or so minutes for confirmations] Set an alarm - don't forget!
* Sell transferred BTC for USD on Mt.Gox
* Dollar-cost-average purchase y USD worth of BTC every z hours via bitcoinbuilder.com 
Each BTC buy must be &gt; 0.1 so you have an upper limit on your frequency meaning you may need to increase z.
y = x / (2 x 7 x (24/z) )
 
e.g. To dollar cost average buy $125 worth of BTC every two weeks spend $1.86 every 5 hours.
I might get some slip on the move between Gox and CampBX but by having a bunch of my automated buys happen during random dips I figure it all works out well enough for me.
If it really dips and I want to take advantage I can temporarily increase y or decrease z.
Not fully automated but I can go two weeks between worrying about it! :)

*    $ to spend is x
*    Dollar-cost-average purchase y USD worth of BTC every z hours via bitcoinbuilder.com
For bi-weekly paycheck:
y = x / (2 x 7 x (24/z) )
e.g. To dollar cost average buy $125 worth of BTC in two weeks spend $1.86 every 5 hours (at Mt.Gox with bitcoinbuilder.com).
