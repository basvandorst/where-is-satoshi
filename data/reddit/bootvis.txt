It's a dangerous game to play. The front running others describe is also difficult if pools are abusing this because a pool can do this:
1. Monitor the transactions they will include for addresses associated with private keys they hold (easy, they need these transactions anyways)
2. Create a transaction that immediately spends the input
3. Don't include any others.

Just curious, how do you figure that?

Also, throwing away the key is generally considered a bad idea.

When you lack data, superstition is useful.

You can't extrapolate from the effects of mining centralization to block size increase. The first worked out well, the second no one knows for certain. 
I agree with you that keeping the limit changes the economical model but this is not the case yet, transacting is still possible for a small fee despite the spam, as it always was. The technical model would change with an increase and the burden of proof should be with those that want to increase  as that step introduces risk in the technical sense and there are no problems creating transactions yet. 
Edit: that sketch is a very unfair characterization of the core devs, they know their stuff.

That's not what I meant. There is plenty of data that vaccination does work and beats the alternative. Getting the data is also the thing you should do when you lack data. From Kahnemans Thinking, Fast and Slow: if you see something moving in the bushes be careful because there could be a tiger. So if you need to go to the bushes, take a look whether some dangerous animal is there and only proceed if safe.

Yes but if we thought that vaccination didn't have a useful side effect, i.e. preventing disease we wouldn't do it. Vaccination is good because preventing polio is good and the adverse effects on the population are at best (worst) small. No _sane_ person prefers a small theoretical chance of autism over a larger chance of a number of terrible diseases. Yet here we are. The block size issue is completely different: we simply do not know what would happen and since we only have one blockchain we should be careful because failure sucks big time and the benefit of a change are small (compared to the possibility of forking, chaos and loss of confidence). Yet here we are.

This is the basics. You should not be trading if this is something you need to debate. I’m not an ass when I say: don’t trade when you can’t explain this stuff drunk. If you follow this advice I almost certainly save you both money and time.

I have an actual rabbit with more clue than you. I’ve made a handy guide for you:
Step 1: Get a clue
Step 2: Trade
Step 3: Profit or loss, most likely the latter.

That's not what I asked: how long is an address not usable after finding a block?
If I have 100 addresses I need 2 to be available for mining. Can you do the math on what happens a group with a large percentage of hashing power starts looking for high hashes for different timeout settings?
@_date: 2016-05-20 22:22:03
So 2/3 of the network won't be mining?

Good news and good luck to Jonas!

This is just hand-waving. Please choose a scheme and work out the implications.
@_date: 2016-05-20 19:20:45
What if I get 100 addresses? How long do you propose to not allow new mining per address?
