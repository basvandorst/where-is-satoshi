Also: What I've been telling to other traders. Say I hold 1,000btc and want to increase my btc holdings. Because everyone is weary about January 31st I will make a huge sell order in one of the exchanges hoping that I can trickle and cause a panic sell from others. Then when the price is lower and I have plenty of fiat currency I'll buy back in, increasing my BTC holding.

I've been wondering...
If you're a user of coinbase they do not send out their transactions in 15min (timeout of BitPay)... so what happens?
How do Coinbase users purchase things in Bitcoin if the vendor is using BitPay and the transaction times out in 15min?

Bipay is only Bitcoins for now. I suppose if Litecoins gain more popularity they might consider it.

of course you're helping! It's about being decentralized and 700 KB/s is actually pretty fast for an upload rate. I don't think Comcast/AT&amp;T reaches that speed and we have tons of nodes running behind them so I'll say you're contributing at a lot faster than others and myself.
Also because the block works like a torrent, your total speed of 700 KB/s is not the full download speed a user will be getting. He/she will be getting up to 700 KB/s from you AND from others as well bringing up the download speed.

It's not a new crypto-coin. It's something that "colors" a bitcoin address.... I'm still learning myself but...
Say I'm raising funds to start my company, Good Human, Inc. I use color coins to issue 1,000 shares. Basically I can sell these shares to my investor without having to use an exchange like Havelock. It's something that you can use to freely exchange shares that represent something just like how you exchange bitcoins. Problem is you really have to trust the issuer (me in this case).
That's what I've learned so far..

You can buy from coinbase and also transfer out to a paper wallet using coinbase. This is if you give them enough trust. You can also generate an offlinte wallet yourself by going to  also.

I'll recommend MtGox, they would be safe and reliable.
Make sure to turn on two factor authentication just for security measures (free using google authenticator). You can also purchase yubikey for another security measure.
Compared to other recommendation MtGox would be the cheapest option. (They only charge 0.6%/transaction and if you use Dwolla that's only $0.25 to fund your MtGox account[verification is required to use Dwolla])

If you're the owner of the faucet, the idea is to give away your BTC in (very small amounts usually) to random people so that they can try it out. I believe the site is showing how you can automate this process

Have you tried contacting them in anyway or are you waiting till Sunday when they're going to upgrade their infrastructure?
@_date: 2013-07-26 18:21:15
Hmmm this caught my eye so I did some detective work.
BitEnsure claims that they are same people as [MetaNeutral Engineering]( They make software for market analysis. The company is located in Colorado but was just founded earlier this year, January 31st to be exact. For some reason the principal office address is in Pembroke Pines, FL.
From what I see they are relatively new to their primary business and for BitEnsure they claim that they could guarantee all the deposits (without giving any amount). To me it sounds a little too good to be true.... but that's just my 2cents. Anyone else like to continue investigating?
@_date: 2013-08-22 13:20:20

I think MtGox's security is pretty good. They got hacked once and I'm sure they put a lot of reinforcements to not let it happen again. Problem is they're too big for their own success and they can't keep up with the demand. There needs to be more diversity so that's why I'm recommending CampBX whenever I can so that exchanges can be de-centralized instead of MtGox having most of the power

Actually there's other ways you can fund your CampBX account. You can send them your personal checks (few days for deposit to clear) or USPS money order (which is what I use). I do agree that using Dwolla these days is ridiculous though...

I just called Fidelity and turns out this article is inaccurate and that they do not offer Bitcoin Investment Trust on their self-directed IRAs. They are however "looking into it" as an option but that's about it.

As much as MtGox is having issues and people seem to hate them, they still handle majority of the volume of exchange (though BitStamp is surpassing them these days in terms of USD).
What happened back in April was that MtGox was a dominate bitcoin exchange. Everyone, even the smaller exchanges went by MtGox's rates of bitcoins. When the main supplier failed, it drove everyone into panic selling thinking it's the end of bitcoin as we know it and they all sold it cheap.
We all have a tendency for brand recognition so I'm not sure if we'll ever get a completely decentralized bitcoin exchange. BitStamp might be the next MtGox.

just an FYI, it takes a few days for your balance to transfer from your bank account to Dwolla, then finally to MtGox.
I'll recommend you start your transfer from your bank to Dwolla while you wait to be verified in MtGox so that once you are verified by MtGox, you can fund your account right-away.
The process for me is usually:
Start a transfer from bank to Dwolla: 3-4 business days (usually 4)
MtGox to credit my account: 1 business day (they don't work weekends however)
Also, you may need to be verified within Dwolla.

still not fixed...

The problem is that the information they pull on you to match your identity is not always correct. I finally got verified after I answered questions wrong on purpose.

I like when I see a correct statement on reddit
@_date: 2013-02-27 05:11:03
wouldn't it be awesome if MtGox starts giving out interest for us to keep money with them?
@_date: 2013-09-11 03:17:58
Right, but you're asking that in form of complete access to Dwolla And document submission?

You need to have your MtGox account verified first before you can use Dwolla to fund your account

what was your experience with bitinstant like?
I used them on Friday and had no issues (other than no clear guidance from bitinstant's site on max fund amount, and 2 different CVS stores unable to use moneygram that I had to go to walmart)

Hey bigwavedave000,
Coinbase uses ACH to deposit/withdraw USD funds from your bank account. It is normal for it to take 7 days as ACH deposit/withdraw days are counted as business days.

How well do you think you'll be able to explain bitcoin to him by yourself?
I'm guessing he's having to navigate through all sorts of sales-pitch or have his assistants do that for him. Why not simply ask him when he's going to be at a bar next time and tell him in person?
I'm sure BitPay would love to have them as a customer and you can talk to them first to see if they reached out to Newegg already. Short simple bottom line is this, irreversible transaction, 0% chance of fraud order, and if you were to use BitPay it only costs 1% and have USD deposited within 24 hours. If I were an online retailer it seems like a nobrainer to me. The only problem is the cost of implementation.
Awesome story though, randomly stumbling upon CEO of newegg like that.
@_date: 2013-08-22 13:23:38
Hahaha you got it. They were a virtual office... I did contact them prior but did not get a response. The thing is though I really, really want them to succeed. I was hoping to get to see them, know the faces behind the operation, and be a good customer that stands behind them. Hopefully next time I'll get a positive reply.
@_date: 2013-11-14 02:32:09
Hey all,
So I was able to get a beta access and so far it's disappointing for US users. They do not accept any time of USD deposits from US users, not even wire. If you're a user outside of US, great! You should be able to use them without a problem.
@_date: 2013-12-05 00:17:20

China fixes it's price between CNY and USD. Couldn't they also own the exchange that converts between CNY and BTC, which they could also fix the price, resulting all BTC to have one standard price...?
Or would this not work because they don't mint BTC?

I'm uncomfortable with the amount of access you request to my Dwolla account. Why can I not simply transfer the money to your exchange?
@_date: 2013-08-22 22:01:50
There are several ways, it depends on how easy you want it to be.
Easiest is probably using  and find someone in your area who's willing to sell you bitcoins.
With that said, I can also sell you bitcoins. I accept payment via bank deposit (meaning you go to a bank in US, deposit cash into my account, then I send bitcoins to your wallet).
You can also sign up with exchanges yourself like BitStamp, CampBX, CoinBase, and MtGox.

Thanks, I had no idea who he was on that video he posted about MtGox

Are you still giving out 0.01BTC?

Can you find the version of the Bitcoin Wallet you're using?
This happened to me when I was using an old Bitcoin wallet software and forgot to update to the latest one.

Sadly? SADLY? that's the best outcome of investment in bitcoin, to pay for one's future. Companies sure pay you better once you have a degree. When are you thinking of caching out? When you reach that tuition goal?
@_date: 2013-11-12 04:50:07
As much as I was against Coinbase, I think they're the best option if you're in US.
Here is their price list: 
From there they usually charge 1% coinbase fee and also give you less per coin as you sell more.

Loggan08 seems to be from Europe since he's talking about SEPA.
In US it really depends on your bank of how much it costs to do international wire but typically it's $30~40.

wire transfers are done using your bank. Assuming you're in the US, you'll have to visit your bank, request to do an international wire transfer to MtGox (in Japan) and send the funds to them. Honestly with the fees involved it'll probably be easier to use Dwolla. I gave them my SSN, no problems. It does take longer to fund your account through Dwolla though as you'll have to provide proof of identification to MtGox
