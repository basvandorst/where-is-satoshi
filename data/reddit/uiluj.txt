That's like saying a dumbass is literally a buttocks with low intelligence.

Maybe, maybe not. I know I'm not going to pay for anything at all. I rather have free news, then use common sense, logic and reason to deduce whether any particular news is "honest". I hope it's the same for people who pay for more "honest" news. I hope they don't think just because it costs more,therefore the news is automatically less bias.

"Credibility is 
the main value which 
makes people ready 
to pay for journalism. 
 If the public is not able to differ between what is real journalism and what is paid (advertorials), they’ll see no reason to pay for any newspaper–so more people will use free-of-charge media and the Internet, which, in fact, we currently observe.”
Oh the irony of your link.
I didn't check all of them, but I'm very certain that almost all the bitcoin sites that were "exposed" are free-of-charge media. No one is paying these websites to be "honest", there's no economic incentive. You can expose these few sites, but as long as there's no economic incentive, more pay-to-play sites will appear.

Karm... kar.... caramel? Damn, I'm so close, it's at the tip of my tongue.

The thing is that they aren't bitcoinites like the people of so they think bitcoin is just a fad and it will drop in value as time goes on. They don't want to stall and then end up with thousands of useless bitcoins.
It makes sense because although it's just a coincidence, bitcoin has dropped in value ever since the last time they sold a bunch of bitcoins.

Sorry if I'm missing the point, but what does his letter to Senator Manchin have to do with Obama?
More importantly, what has President Obama directly done to stifle and quash technological innovation and American ingenuity to the point of turning this country into an Orwellian dystopia?
Two very broad questions that probably takes more time to answer than you care to give me, but I honestly don't see how Obama is relevant to this topic while I was reading you having a fit of rage on the internet.

I don't understand, do you believe all businesses should disclose every single thing they do? 
I don't see how it's corrupt or deceptive. The websites aren't lying or telling false stories. No matter what they report, it's up to the readers to decide if it's news or not.
What's wrong with a business doing something for money? Why should the media be exempt from basic economic principles of supply and demand? Why is a website covering a "story" for money different from buying an ad space on the webpage?

Okay, let me try again.
Is Obama secretly Joe Manchin with blackface? The resemblance is uncanny!

You trust strangers over the internet everytime you use the internet. Do you personally know what Google is doing with your search history? Do you personally know Mark Zuckerberg when you use Facebook?
In this globalized economy, you have to trust the people working in sweatshops on the other side of the world to make your clothing, or to trust the people responsible for the infrastructure that allows you to use the internet and to take a shit in the toilet.
Our entire society depends on trusting strangers, not even strangers over the internet.

So you're saying measuring uptime is useless considering the value of something, and this thread is pointless? Okay.

Those payment networks on based on physical media, i.e. fiat currency. Although I agree
it would be a more meaningful comparison, it's not why I disagreed with you.


I tried reading between the lines of your previous comment, and nothing of the sort can be implied from it. You were dismissing the fiat currency because of inflation, which is a huge digression from what the thread was originally about.

In that case, the alarming thing should be the corrupt officials. We should be upset about how the legal process doesn't work. The government breaking into your home, damaging your property and potentially harming you is a lot worse than the government investigating your computer because of tor.

I said more upset about x than y. 
I did not say should be upset about x and should not be upset about y.
I'm not trying to belittle y issues. They are important, but they stem from a larger root issue, which is x.
