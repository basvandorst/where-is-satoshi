Meanwhile: We make tons of money while you cry with regret as bitcoin approaches 20,000.

Correction: You can already use Bitcoin as a currency. It **is** already wealth. Many places already accept bitcoin. 
Anyone who uses Stripe, which is one of the most popular payment method providers on the internet, accept bitcoin.
Newegg &amp; Itch.Io are two major examples. Newegg is the better, online BestBuy, so don't act like that isn't small. PC Gaming is a huge industry as well. Those are just two of many examples.
Black market transactions also do count as well. Just because something is illegal doesn't mean it isn't wealth.

It amazes me that when I point out the irrefutable fact it is indeed currency and does have real, tangible value, some of you have emotional meltdowns about it.
**FACT:** Bitcoin can be used to purchase goods.
**FACT:** Bitcoin is a currency, with real tangible value. It is wealth.
You can blabber all you want about predictions of the future (a future where inevitably cryptocurrency has replaced fiat) but you just look like an uninformed idiot.

Whoa! How did you exist when I hadn't yet met you? That doesn't make any sense.

It is extremely unlikely to ever go as far down as 1000 ever again. People will begin selling everything they have to buy bitcoin when it goes closer to that level, seeing as how if it ever reached 1000, any investment made will multiply 100x in the next decade. Both the common man and billionaires would seize that opportunity so quickly, it won't ever touch 1000 for even a second.
Bitcoin is the future, and it's unstoppable unless there's some form of global apocalypse. People know this, or are willing to risk this, so 1000? Never again.

What is reddit, who am I, and how do I achieve the level of intelligence equal to [that of the redditor]( I've tried drinking bleach, hitting myself in the head repeatedly with a brick, and pouring acid into my eyes to limit reading comprehension, but I am still too damn smart.
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:54:06


It's weird you're thinking this way. Some insane conspiracy where every person is 1000 accounts? Why use such lunatic hyperbole?
If each user had a measly 2 accounts, then the total is split in half. 50% of a big number is a much smaller number. Obviously, but not obvious apparently.
So users having multiple accounts has a significantly relevant to what % of the total is a single person. Even if most have 1, if a small percent have 2 or 3, it can lower that number quite a bit.

There is this strange idea called [Object Permanence]( where things can exist outside of your limited view.
One example is the fact people exist outside of reddit even when you are only currently browsing reddit.
Sounds strange, I know... but you'll soon grow to learn more.

Coinbase fees are bad, unless you use their exchange (GDAX) which automatically creates you an account &amp; uses all the same information you already provided.
I heard the fees are extremely low / 0 to withdraw to bank account?

Evidence or we are forced to believe you're pulling this assumption from your ass.
Without evidence, you can't say what is "almost certainly" the case, either way. Don't be irrational.
Without data, we cannot know what % is from the same user.
