Hard-forking introduces its own risks - it forces everyone to come along or else creates two active chains.

It's common for markets to revolve around the most-liquid item. E.g. at one point Uganda priced every currency / traded item in # required to buy a cow. Not kidding.

How? AFAIK it's irrelevant to security.

Super interesting! And inspiring to know that when Lightning is introduced there will be the possibility and plan to cut fees down a further 96%. That's super-linear off-chain scaling for you. :)
Note its implementation is speculative AFAIK: "If you look at the details, channel factories obviously increase the complexity of off-chain payment networks, which already is immense. Most likely, the factories are not designed for an immediate deployment, but rather as an optimization, after the first nodes and ties of the Lightning Network have been established. Nevertheless, the advantages the factories provide can be vast, according to the calculations in the paper."

This would be good to sticky.

Yes, thin clients will exist. Lightning Labs created Neutrino for that purpose.

For users as well. If you transmit transactions and they're separately included in 2 different blockchains, how can you be sure which is the one of record. There will necessarily be divergence to 2 separate coins, ala bitcoin and bitcoin cash.

Lightning "Payment Factories" could reduce the need for on-chain transactions by another ~90%.

Bitcoin transactions support paying to multiple parties, because every transaction can have multiple input addresses (all signed / owned by the sender) and multiple output addresses (that can be unrelated to one another).
You can take advantage of this using Electrum's "Pay to Many" feature - it's a great way to reduce fees.

The hardware requirements are very modest, much less than running a full bitcoin node for example, which has significant bandwidth and storage needs. Lightning transactions and communication is very light-weight by comparison, because the transactions need only be shared between the parties involved rather than everyone in the network, so the overall resources required to transmit and store them is much lower. A mini-PC or raspberry pi would do.
Yes half a bitcoin would be plenty for most individual expense cases - consider that the size of the channel just needs to be big enough to accommodate your net payments over time, so in most cases / for most expenses, 10K+ USD would accommodate a lot of daily payment volume.

What needs to happen for the Lightning Network to be deployed and what can I do as a user to help?




Do I need to be a miner to be a Lightning Network node?


How would the lightning network work between exchanges:

Dollar-cost averaging will help protect you from price volatility. Just buy at a rate of 1k or 500 per week, and you'll average across any dips or spikes in price.

These are pending transactions stacked by how much fee is attached to them (in Satoshis/Byte). As time goes by, miners bundle the highest-fee transactions into blocks and commit them to the chain. When your transactions are waiting for confirmation it's because they are "buried" underneath higher-fee transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:13:59
Good luck with the 24GB blocks you'll need to handle all transactions on-chain, and the dedicated server-farms you'll need to host your full nodes.

From the bitcoin wiki: 
This is by far the most important reason for running a full node, though it is a little difficult to understand.
As explained previously, full nodes enforce the consensus rules no matter what. However, lightweight nodes do not do this. Lightweight nodes do whatever the majority of mining power says. Therefore, if most of the miners got together to increase their block reward, for example, lightweight nodes would blindly go along with it. If this ever happened, the network would split such that lightweight nodes and full nodes would end up on separate networks, using separate currencies. People using lightweight nodes would be unable to transact with people using full nodes. If all businesses and many users are using full nodes, then this network split is not a critical problem because users of lightweight clients will quickly notice that they can't send or receive bitcoins to/from most of the people who they usually do business with, and so they'll stop using Bitcoin until the evil miners are overcome, which is the appropriate response. However, if almost everyone on the network is using lightweight nodes in this situation, then everyone would continue being able to transact with each other, and so Bitcoin could very well end up "hijacked" by evil miners.
In practice, miners are unlikely to attempt anything like the above scenario as long as full nodes are prevalent because the miners would lose a lot of money. But the incentives completely change if everyone uses lightweight nodes. In that case, miners definitely do have an incentive to change Bitcoin's rules in their favor. It is only reasonably secure to use a lightweight node because most of the Bitcoin economy uses full nodes.
Therefore, it is critical for Bitcoin's survival that the great majority of the Bitcoin economy be backed by full nodes, not lightweight nodes. This is especially important for Bitcoin businesses, which have more economic weight. To contribute to Bitcoin's economic strength, you must actually use a full node for your real transactions (or use a lightweight node connected to a full node that you personally control). Just running a full node on a server somewhere does not contribute to Bitcoin's economic strength.

Yeah as catVdog123 says, if the private key is visible in the photograph that is enough to claim the coins, and your best bet by far.
Download the Electrum wallet, get it set up (there docs may be helpful for this, or youtube) 
Then you'll want to "sweep" the private key into a new address.

It's the first time to break 14% since the Segwit2x fork lost steam in late October!
In terms of the real effects of this - peak transactions per block is 2,700, up from 2,200 prior to segwit.
Here's looking forward to all the milestones ahead.

Agree on OP point 1 though - on what grounds is Gold not decentralized?

To be clear, it's still there, it was added in 0.9.2:
    Add `getwalletinfo`, `getblockchaininfo` and `getnetworkinfo` calls (will replace hodge-podge `getinfo` at some point)
And only `getinfo` was removed in 0.16.0:
    The deprecated RPC `getinfo` was removed. It is recommended that the more specific RPCs are used:
    * `getblockchaininfo`
    * `getnetworkinfo`
    * `getwalletinfo`
    * `getmininginfo`

Another nice option is to expose your node to connections via a Tor hidden service. This prevents others from identifying your location via your public IP address.
@_date: 2018-03-29 10:07:25
Agreed, and it will be far less than 1%. Bitcoin is currently doing in the cents per transaction (so around 2% for a $4 charge), lightning fees are currently around 1000x better, so 0.002% at $4. Even for a very small, $0.08 (1000 sats) payment on lightning today I paid 0.2%, or $0.00016 (2 sats) in fees.

Have you thought about integrating with an existing implementation over gRPC? There are go and c++ implementations that are good and solid.
