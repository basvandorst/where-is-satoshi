It’s kinda true currently. I’m not sure it was true when money was first conceived... way back when sea shells substituted for coins. Force is the first and most primitive transaction. Bartering is the second. But in bartering, there is a recognition between the parties that there is a rough parity of force between them, and that determining who is stronger through the use of force is likely to be more costly than the bartering transaction is worth. Money is an abstraction of bartering, and can only properly be utilized where the parties involved all implicitly accept that force cannot be used to compel any party to enter into a transaction unwillingly - otherwise, it’s not a monied transaction, just a theft or an assault with decorations. 
On a purely theoretical level, money and force are antithetical concepts. Monied transactions are what happens when force is declined. Forced transactions are what happens when money fails. We don’t live in a world with “pure” money, so we do end up with “money” that’s at least partially backed by force.

Heh... look, nobody here knows. Nobody anywhere knows. 
The only advice we can offer is that the value of your btc will tend to increase over time vs any fiat currency due to the deflationary properties of bitcoin. The longer you can hold, the more likely it is the value will increase. Likely - not foolproof. It took almost 3 years to recover after the spike in 2014, and we’re approaching 9 months since the 2017/2018 spike peaked. 
I suspect that you already know what you’re planning on doing, and you’re looking for someone to offer you emotional validation or reassurance about the decision you’ve already made. My advice would be that when you do find the advice that gives you that warm fuzzy validation you’re craving, you probably should do the opposite of what they’re recommending.

It's not even really a maybe.  At worst, the malleability issue could trick someone (an exchange) into sending someone coins twice, but it couldn't be used to force the coins to be sent in the first place.  The scenario would have to be either: 
SR2 sends 1200 BTC to someone who uses the malleability trick to make SR2 think that the withdrawal transaction failed (since the hash they sent doesn't match the blockchain), the customer claims they didn't get the coins, so the SR2 unquestioningly send *another* 1200 BTC, thus emptying their digital coffers.
SR2 sends, say, a 5 BTC withdrawal to someone who uses the malleability trick, and then the SR2 admins get tricked to repeat the withdrawal 480 times in a row, thus emptying their wallet files until digital flies are fluttering out.
I, personally, am not in the habit of questioning the limits of human stupidity.  But if *either* of these scenarios actually played out, then these admins have officially surpassed the "invade Russia by land during the winter" threshold of bad ideas.

Other posters have answered (they definitely just stole the coins), but I just want to reiterate: the "bug" doesn't allow coin theft - it affects the way some wallet implementations show balances.  Under the right circumstances, it would be possible to trick a user into thinking that a "send" failed, and that user would then send the coins again, thus paying the recipient twice.
This is almost more of a social engineering trick... the worst part of the "bug" is that it was in the reference implementation of the wallet software (which no exchange should have been using anyway), so it would have been possible to trick a *person*, but exchanges *should* have had custom software to manage their inputs/outputs.
The Bitcoin protocol itself remains unchanged.  That's not to say it wasn't a serious bug, but it doesn't affect the intended operation of the bitcoin client or the critical structure of the blockchain.

You can double spend, triple spend, etc., etc., with 0% of the hash power.  The multiple spends *will* be detected - it's just a matter of how long it takes for the vendor to notice that you're trying to scam them.  The 51% attack describes a scenario where the attacker can decide which (if any) of the duplicate spends make it into the blockchain and becomes a valid, confirmed spend.

@_date: 2014-03-07 20:23:21
I'm a software engineer, and a huge amount of my work involves a considerable level of reverse engineering and other forensic techniques - this "analysis" would get you fired if you were on my team.
Quoting disk space and Moore's Law as "old terms" indicates a shocking lack of understanding of the entire reason he mentions them in the paper:
* Reclaiming disk space is a *huge* issue in management of the blockchain - it's not just the growing storage size, but the ability to efficiently access/analyze and verify the blockchain.  Being able to prune it is going to be *critical* going forward.
* CPU usage in the paper refers to what we know categorize as hashing speed - back when the paper was written, only CPUs were available for hash, and GPUs weren't yet being utilized.  Satoshi's emails bear this point out further - he was referring to the speed at which hashing could be optimized, from CPU, to GPU, and finally to ASIC.  We reached ASIC far faster than he anticipated.  In case they didn't notice, the ASIC rollout was the biggest Bitcoin infrastructure story of 2013.  BFL drama, anyone?
The article makes mention of their career paths "converging", meaning they chose to ignore conflicts.  Dorian's timezone doesn't fit BTC Satoshi's posting times, his command of English is way off of what the spec paper demonstrated... and there's one more sentence in the article that's very telling:


So she believes someone like her invented BTC?  Narcissistic navel gazing much?  Granted, everyone who works in tech can get tunnel vision, but the self adulation is a red flag.  The "forensic analyst" could only see the issue from the point of view of her own tech training - this is the sleuth-y equivalent of jumping at your own shadow.
Neither military protocol analysis, nor AI touch on BTC concepts.  "Computing security" intersects briefly, but given the quality of the available "analysis" they're putting out for us, I'd question how well someone whose work involves checking boxes on anti-virus software settings can investigate novel cryptographic proof-of-work functions combined with symmetric key engineering.
Satoshi's paper involved a deep understanding of economics (including an understanding of the Austrian school of eco), game theory (knowledge of dominant strategies), cryptography, math, and a wide range of programming disciplines, including p2p protocols, basic database design, cryptographic libraries, etc.
I could very easily point to Bitcoin's usage of SHA hashing for merkle-roots and it's p2p decentralized structure as extending concepts previously laid down in the 'git' version control system authored by... da DUM: 
**Linus Torvalds - the inventor of Linux.**
Linus is also a brilliant and prolific programmer, uses mixed English/American spellings, uses two spaces after '.', and has demonstrated a deep understanding of system design, game theory, and other related BTC topics.
Remember also, Bitcoin's most innovative feature is it's ability to validate and synchronize remote data storage in the presence of nodes who would have an incentive to corrupt the data.  Git does the same thing, except without using proof-of-work to validate inputs.  
Git was, in fact, engineered with the purpose in mind of being able to validate code entries as being from a trusted source - this was partially a result of an attempt back in 2003 to hack the central servers containing Linux source code in order to insert a backdoor in a system call.  Torvalds wanted to be able to create a decentralized code storage he could trust.  So he built a system using merkle trees, which could detect tampering immediately and prevent it from being inserted into the tree.  In Bitcoin, that tree is known as the blockchain.
Of course, this all ignores some details - such as BTC being written in C++, which Linus Torvalds is known to hate writing in.  Torvalds is also in the wrong timezone to be Satoshi, but most significantly, I don't think Linus would hide his identity.  
But if you want to report on technical analysis, then give me technical details - not idiotic coincidences.  Show me some work this guy did which actually lines up with BTC - not just "computer" work.  That could be anything from Photoshop to soldering.

My mom got interviewed a decade or two back for information related to some genealogical research she was doing at the time.  She bored me to tears multiple times talking about details in the who-begat-who whens and wheres.  Consequently, young naive teenage me was *shocked* at how much the reporter managed to get wrong in the published article - things I *know* my mother (who was a meticulous record-keeper) would *never* get wrong or mis-state.  I got a follow-up lesson a few years later when my dad was misquoted after he asked maintenance staff to leave a food processing plant due to a freon leak (on a Sunday morning, ~4 people in the building, IIRC), which somehow became an "industrial explosion" involving hospitalizations, dozens of "victims" and a full block affected when it was reported that evening.  I suppose, to be fair, the ambulance that the reporters called *did* pick up a homeless guy who was always hanging around the nearest corner, so technically, there was some medical involvement.  But I still remember that as the day that my last bits of trust in media died.
I was lucky in that I got a relatively early education on just how little you can trust the printed word, and how much less you can trust the reporters involved.

All wallets have private keys.  They can be used for signing messages as well as transactions.
@_date: 2014-02-19 16:24:43
It's not likely, but it's possible.  Double spends occur when someone sends two transactions from a single address to two different addresses (let's just say the transaction is for the full content of the address for simplicity).
This can be attempted in two ways: either the two transactions are sent out more or less simultaneously, or the transactions are separated by a few minutes (enough time for a confirmation or two to flow in)
In both cases, nodes that are looking for double spends will notice pretty quickly - even with transactions being entered at two ends of the BTC network, it *should* only take a few seconds for the transactions to propagate.
Once both transactions are out in the open, it becomes something of a crapshoot - whichever transaction gets included in the main blockchain will be the one that is validated - and it's pretty much a matter of random chance.  In this case, an attacker *could* do not just a double spend, but a 100x spend, sending those BTC to wallets they control, and increasing their chances of retaining the BTC.  Obviously, the more transactions they spit out in order to attempt this, the more obvious the double-spend attempt is, and the more rapidly the double spend attempt can be detected.
This is why double spends can't be done stealthily or reliably unless the attacker controls a considerable amount of hashing power and a large swath of the network.  Someone who controls that much power probably isn't going to try to skip out on a restaurant bill, but, again, it's still possible.  The bigger threat to a small merchant would be the script kiddy who does a spend, then sends out 10x or 100x double spends to try to retain the BTC.  
There's probably a BTC service that does detection for that - maybe someone else can point it out.
@_date: 2014-01-15 15:51:39
small quibble - 51% just describes the level at which an attacker's chances of executing a successful double spend tip in their favor - it's not a magic threshold of certainty.  The 49% pool could still get several blocks in a row and break the double spend.

I'm not sure "full reserve" is practical on a highly volatile commodity. If it crashes tomorrow to $0.01, they'll have many, many times the reserve amount. If BTC doubles tomorrow, they'd be massively under reserve.
It's also not a practical (or even completely possible) way to run a *currency* exchange - you can't have "equal" reserves of € and $ unless you control the entire market and can set the rates... which is only really possible as a thought experiment, and not a particularly enlightening one at that, as they would essentially be denominations of each other, and not separate currencies. 
@_date: 2017-02-28 18:51:22
That could be true of any commodity dealer. If a gold exchange is robbed, they are unlikely to have cash on hand to make their customers "whole". They'd need to be insured or otherwise backed to do so. Replace "gold" with anything - rice, wheat, cars, etc, and it's the same thing. Very, very few merchants have more cash than inventory. Walmart may have billions in cash, but they have many times that amount in inventory, infrastructure, and assets (IIA). If they get hacked and lose their cash, they've got serious but fixable problems. If they suddenly lose their IIA, they cease to exist.
Bitcoin is primarily a currency - but many see it as a commodity or investment because of it's relative youth and the wildly varying assessments of it's value and potential. Treating it as a commodity *only* is where they're making the misjudgment. If you look at bitcoin and all you see is a gussied-up-crypto-version of a prepaid debit card, then this policy might make sense. For a full-fledged floating currency tho, this policy is completely unworkable.
@_date: 2017-02-28 18:40:15
Replace "Bitcoin" with "Euro", or any other currency, and see if it still makes sense. If your customers deposit a total of €1000 and $1000, then the total value of your holdings can expressed in either US Dollars (total value of $2061 at today's exchange rate), or Euro (total of €1943), but it's impossible to have "equal" reserves of each, unless the exchange rate is fixed at 1 - which never happens.

They're an exchange. If Hawaiians all sell and want money, then Coinbase pays out whatever $$ amount they owe. If they don't have sufficient $$ reserves, they sell the account holder's BTC to cover it. 
In any case, Hawaiians probably account for 1% or less of their account holders. I don't think it's going to be an issue for them.  Now, if they had to have matching reserves in *every* state, they'd just have to close their doors. Imagine if they had matching $$ funds today, and then the price jumped 10% tomorrow. They'd be out of "compliance" - not because they were irresponsible with their account holder's money, but because they have a commodity which is in high demand.

The amount of mining is only very loosely related to the price - the more power directed towards mining, the more resiliency the network as a whole has.  The more hashing power there is, the less likely it becomes that any one entity can exercise any kind of coercive control over the network. THe more resiliency the network has, the safer the bitcoin network is - so the value can increase.

I don't disagree, I'm just comparing bubbles.  
In 2011, the price went from 0.8-&gt;33, a factor of ~40.  In 4/2013, it went from ~13 to ~260, a factor of 20.  The price was holding around ~130 before this most recent rise, so a 2013 bubble repeat would end up with a price of 2600, and a repeat of the 2011 bubble would give us 5200.
I guess if I was going to try my hand at prediction, then I'd say that this will be a correspondingly smaller bubble compared to April, by a factor of about 2.  So we'll see a 10x price increase to ~1300 on Gox.
I would expect the third "pop" to be correspondingly smaller, too.  In 2011, the pop went from 33-&gt;~3, IIRC - a factor of 1/11.  Then in April, we went from 266-&gt;75, a factor of ~3/10.  
If we look at it in terms of percentage, then, for the sake of simplicity, we extrapolate from 9/10 -&gt; 7/10 -&gt; ?, assuming a scale of 7/9.  So that gives us a rough expected reduction of 49/90, or about 5/9 ~55%.  So we can expect bitcoin to retain ~45% of it's value after the next pop, which works out to ~600 USD.
And then we wait for the next bubble.

Avalon has a lot of orders ahead of you in line too - order now, and maybe it will deliver in April.

* BFL is targeting higher production, but they haven't proven they can deliver yet - and they also have a large backlog.

The Nvidia vs AMD(ATI) cards has to do with internal chip architecture and available optimization software - here's an [overview](  Anything more detailed than that won't make sense to anyone who isn't a professional programmer.
I did see a thread on bitcointalk about a CUDA (Nvidia) improvement that allowed for a 3x speed up, but even that didn't allow it to match AMD... given the ASIC rollout happening in slow motion across the network, it's unlikely that much work on improving GPU mining will be done in the future.

That is one of the dangers that likely lay ahead.  At the moment, it would really only allow them to slow down the network, perhaps even to a halt, but that would require a considerable investment not just to launch the attack, but to maintain it.  Banks are unlikely to engage in this sort of action - governments, however, are another issue altogether.

Amazon is huge retailer, and bitcoin is considered experimental by anyone who works with it in any depth other than speculating on it at Mt.Gox/Coinbase/etc. 
It took 10 years for researchers/crypt-analysts to break MD5 - so while ~~AES~~ SHA256 is likely secure, it's possible that the Bitcoin protocol contains some flaw comparable to oracle padding attacks or some other method of side-stepping the encryption.  Additionally, bitcoin's network is not so large or mature that it's impervious to cyber attack from a well-financed government or central bank system.  Last, while bitcoin's transaction fees are pretty low, transaction speed (10 minutes average) is still pretty slow compared to every-day bank transfers or credit/debit cards.  That wouldn't be much of an issue for your average website transaction processing, but it would affect shipping times if you have to wait 24 hours for payment verification - and Amazon is hell-bent on reaching same-day delivery in the near future.
It's still unclear what kind of financial bandwidth bitcoin can carry at this point - it'd be a weird function of speculation, usage, security, network size/power, and fiat currency inflation.  But if Amazon jumped in, then the exchange rate could easily jump by a factor of 10 overnight, which would introduce a great deal of attention and a correspondingly large amount of additional volatility, and make the usage more difficult for vendors (Stability is critical for vendors).  But such a high exchange rate would increasingly attract the vultures.
Bitcoin currently carries about 300Million USD - that's not too much in the grand scheme of things.  As it grows, it will need to demonstrate resiliency in the face of concerted attacks from independent hackers, Russian-style organized crime, government-sponsored cracking attempts (think China), spammy transactions, and good old DDOS-style attacks.
Bitcoin as a system is still maturing - it would be high-risk for Amazon (from both a legal and a financial standpoint) to start accepting bitcoin, and it would be dangerous for bitcoin itself to suddenly have such a large influx of market cap.  
Slow, steady growth is best.
EDIT: Amazon's "virtual" currency is just a relabeled gift card/voucher at this point.  But they could be looking at it as a step towards true virtual currency in the future, and I'm *certain* they'll be watching bitcoin carefully over the next few years (Bezos isn't stupid - he'll understand the disruptive power of new currencies).  But any move by Amazon will bring the wrath of regulators/legislators down on whatever methods he chooses if he's not careful.  On one hand, it seems pretty silly to call Amazon dollars a virtual currency comparable to Bitcoin when AZDs will be completely pegged to the dollar, but on the other hand, it helps introduce the concept of virtual non-traditional currencies to mass consciousness in a very innocuous baby-step kind of way.
EDIT 2 : per timepad, the primary hash function is SHA256 not AES.

Here's the patent : [US5950176](
The main overview:


Notably missing Bitcoin critical keywords and concepts :
 * decentralized/decentralization 
 * cryptographic hash
 * cryptographic signing
 * SHA-256, RIPEMD-160, ECDSA
 * peer-to-peer
 * proof-of-work 
 * merkle/hash tree
 * blockchain/block rewards
...etc. 
Notably *present* non-Bitcoin concept:
 * virtual reserve bank
The article author ~~owns~~ wrote the patent, so he's ~~got a vested interest~~ interpreting it in the broadest sense; really, it looks to me like he saw the terms "trading virtual currency" associated with Bitcoin, and he automatically linked that with his "virtual" trading setup based on speculating on Hollywood productions.
If you ignore the word "virtual", which has such broad definitions so as to have little or no concrete meaning in modern computing (virtual machine, virtual memory, virtual network, virtual interface), then his comparison becomes ridiculous.  We could describe Bitcoin as an "abstract" currency instead of a "virtual" one, and it would destroy his argument.  They perhaps *could* use the patent to go after an exchange, but then the plantiffs would need to define why they have a monopoly on the ones and zeros that describe trading Bitcoin but not trading the ones and zeros that describe trading a dollar - if they can go after a Bitcoin exchange, then they can go after any exchange that trades in derivatives - which could also be described as "virtual".
Anyway, IANAL, but I don't think this is a true threat to BTC.
I am having to remind myself how difficult it can be to explain Bitcoin to non-techs, so it's possible that this could get some ways in a court in front of judges who don't understand technology/virtualization/programming, but hear/see the same buzzwords being tossed around in totally different contexts (just look at how long SCO dragged on). Basically, this claim has no validity, but I can easily imagine that explaining that convincingly to a prejudiced/biased audience would be a long, tedious chore.
Edit 2: changed some wording - AFAIK, Max Keiser is not anti-bitcoin, but he no longer holds the patent he's discussing.

Malthus was the guy from ~1960 who predicted unavoidable world food crises by the 80s or 90's.  Basically, he extrapolated from contemporary consumption/production trends and assumed they would continue unchanged until crisis hit.  His name has become a byword in some circles for this kind of error in logical reasoning - the naive belief that a trend will or can continue unchecked for a long time in an open system.
I assume that he's referring to your 10k-1M prediction, but it's a bit of a stretch to call it Malthusian.

As a firmware programmer (someone who writes C and assembly for custom hardware) it is damn near impossible for a GPU to outperform an ASIC.  I only say "damn near" because combining enough highly optimized GPUs could always outperform a poorly enough designed ASIC. (Never underestimate the ability of bad memory management or stupid APIs/ABIs to slow down a system.) 
Watt-for-watt, the ASIC should out-do GPU by an order or magnitude or three.  Unless the ASIC design is completely brain-dead, **and** the GPUs are utter genius, the ASIC wins, hands down.
@_date: 2013-02-03 18:08:08
It'll probably be a slower ramp up, even assuming everyone gets their ASICs in a timely manner - it's important to remember that this is being done by dedicated amateurs and start-ups, not established corporate machines.  
If you compare the delivery/ramp up time to what we've gotten used to from the well-oiled and well-financed Amazon delivery chains or the near-instant provisioning of EC2, you're going to be disappointed.  Some people will have difficulty getting their rigs connected, some people will have power issues, and I'd be surprised if there isn't a noticeable fraction of ASICs that simply don't work after delivery - there are TONs of kinks still to be worked out, and that's assuming every ASIC company that delivers is doing so in good faith. 
Bottom line, I think it'll be hard to definitively pin-point the changes the ASICs produce in the charts as it's happening real-time, but it'll be pretty easy to look back and identify the time frame in hind-sight.

I have a friend who works at a bank - he's a techie who made the jump to C-level management, and we had a conversation a few weeks ago about bitcoin.  He himself understands what it is pretty well, but he told me that pretty much everyone else at his level in management views it as a pure laundering/ponzi scheme - and some of them are downright paranoid about it. If there's anyone else at his company that views bitcoin favorably, they're keeping quiet, and so is he.  He does know some people at other companies that are downright giddy with bitcoin, but those guys are in hedge funds/investment management - the kind of mathy geeks you'd expect to embrace a new technology with potential.
From what I've learned, people in the financial sector usually fall under the extremes when it comes to their opinion of bitcoin - they can view it as the 'perfect' currency resistant to state coercion, or they can see it as dangerous to them because it sidesteps the banks (and banks are gatekeepers (aka middlemen) for money transfers) and it opens them up to potential liability from governments for participating in laundering.  
Basically, I sympathize, and now that I think about it, I'm actually surprised this is the first time I've heard of this happening.  I'll expect more of this in the future.
Keep in mind that if you go back and contact them about it, that's pretty much showing your hand - I don't think they have much doubt about the transfer, but confronting them about it would confirm it.  I don't know how much you rely on your relationships with this particular bank, but I'd be interested to know if their behavior to you changes in the coming weeks/months.

I would argue that you're missing the point:


It's a complete fool's game to think you can impose what you believe are better ideas on people.  Either your ideas enable better communication, and they'll spread, or your ideas inhibit communication, and they'll die off.  I'm personally in the uBTC/mBTC camp, because I believe those notations are simpler, more efficient, and easier to understand.  Referring to satoshis seems silly to me in the sense that the current decimal limitation is subject to change in the future.  I could be wrong on either or both counts.
You mentioned "what's best for moving forward" - but it's a mistake to think that you actually know what's best for moving forward in a chaotic environment.  This isn't like prediction in math or physics - this is like predicting *language*.  If newcomers find the prefix notation simpler and more intuitive, then that will spread, whether we push it or not.  If they find some flavor of "satoshi" simpler, that will spread.  It doesn't matter how much we push or fight these notations - the next generation will decide, because they'll be much bigger in number than we are.
Do what's simplest for you - not what you think is "better".  It's like arguing Dvorak vs Qwerty.  There isn't a "right" or a "wrong" here.

The computing power involved serves more than a single purpose - each is necessary for Bitcoin to work.
Miners *do* validate transactions, but by validating transactions is only part of what is involved in producing a block.  The block is generated by producing a nonce that, when applied to a set of valid transactions, produces a hash with a targeted number of leading 0s ('nonce' implies the leading 0s); because there is no computationally efficient way to do this, brute force searching must be done.  The miner who finds the first transaction set and nonce matching the target difficulty gets the next block.  Every 2000-ish blocks, the network re-adjusts the difficulty level.
The level of computing power determines the rate at which blocks are discovered, which determines the difficulty.  The difficulty is directly related to security in that it increases the amount of computing power that would be required for an attacker to mount a serious attack on the network.
So, basically:
Computing power -&gt; Block discovery rate -&gt; Target Hash difficulty -&gt; Security
This does somewhat depend on how you measure/define "Security" - safes are measured by how long it takes a competent and determined attacker to break in - Bitcoin usually measures it's security by the hashing power required to mount a 51% attack - that can be measured in terms of both capital investment and power requirements (~65 tera-hashes requires tens of millions in startup investment, not to mention requiring roughly a Gigawatt power plant on the side).  That's our security.  
If computing power doesn't *directly* determine the network's security, then I don't know what you mean by "directly".

IIRC, Satoshi wasn't opposed to removing the block size limit, but he was hesitant to do so too soon, as he felt that lifting the restriction too soon would lead to propagation issues on large blocks, and having a stop-gap "solution" would slow the development of protocols to be built on top of Bitcoin.

The valuation of Bitcoin is a combination of it's scarcity, usability, level of acceptance, and expected appreciation.
Scarcity is set: there are ~10 Million coins in existence, and 25 are created roughly every 10 minutes by miners.  The amount created will halve in a few years, and in 2140, all Bitcoins possible will have been mined.  Part of the scarcity is the *strength* of Bitcoins - they *cannot* be forged.  If a wallet is properly encrypted by standard methods, then no amount of computing power achievable on Earth can steal from it.
In terms of usability, it has a ways to go for most people.  Bitcoin is currently usable in practical terms for people with familiarity with good computer security - an entry-level understanding of private/public key cryptography is a huge plus. Naive or less experienced users can be taken in by scams or hacked.  Restoration of lost funds from such scams is not currently possible, and probably will never be practical.
The level of acceptance is the single biggest driver for Bitcoin value right now.  If even 1% of the world population accepts Bitcoin, then valuations of +$100k are not out of the question.  Near-term levels of under $1k are far more practical while glitches are worked out of the system and protocols are built on top of the blockchain.  If you step under the hood, there are some scalability issues that I think will limit the growth of Bitcoin in the short term (block size being the biggest bottleneck, with the size of the block chain being second) - but it's also worth noting that these are known issues and fixes/proposals for improvements are in active discussion/development.  However, if the US Government steps in and tries to ban Bitcoin, it may or may not succeed in shutting it down, but Bitcoin's exchange value would almost certainly take a huge hit in the short term.
Because Bitcoin is intended to compete with fiat currencies (notably the USD and the Euro), it has a prohibitive long-term advantage from the simple fact that those governments and central banks cannot survive without printing money and devaluing their native currencies.  The USD has lost over 90% of it's value from 40 years ago when it was decoupled from the Gold Standard.  I have no desire to get into a discussion with gold bugs, but one takeaway I get from that simple fact is that the USD is *not* a good long-term store of value - if it was, then Government and Treasury bonds would not exist.  Bitcoin, however, is potentially the strongest form of long-term wealth storage ever invented.
Nobody here or anywhere on Earth can tell you when or if BTC will hit $200.  If this were a free market, then, yes, I would expect BTC to hit 200 within weeks or months.  But there is the single greatest unknown in the world sitting across from us - the threat of regulation by the ever-helpful US Government.  We can't know what it's going to do, long-term or short-term, but very, very few people expect it to be good.

I think that it's probably virtuous by comparison to the alternatives - but that doesn't make it virtuous in of itself.  I'm generally loathe to tell someone else which vices they should and should not engage in, but I don't think I'll ever see drug usage itself as "virtuous"; even antibiotics and vaccines have their down sides. (I'm not an anti-vaxxer - me and my kids get jab'd as scheduled - I'm just aware that re-programming the immune system can have serious side-effects, however rare they are).
So, I'm hesitant to call the Silk Road "virtuous", but it's probably a safer option for users (and many vendors) than street drugs - and compared to the Drug War and prohibition in general, yeah... it's a huge step in the right direction.  
Is the Silk Road "Evil"?  I'll grant that it's moral value is debatable... but in no way (except from the perspective of unquestioning authoritarianism) is it anywhere as evil as the Drug War itself. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 17:00:23
I had the same thought.  
From where I sit, there's an understanding that the dollar, as the world's reserve currency, has the most to lose from the rise of BTC as the flagship of cryptocurrencies.  QE, stimulus, and a host of other monetary abuses are largely masked by the dollar's dominance, but that's exactly the type of abuse that can eventually cause a collapse.  Last I checked, M1 has pretty much doubled since the 2008 crash, yet the official reported inflation % is incredibly low.  Those two facts alone point to either deep inconsistencies in the conventional understanding of monetary policy, or a deliberate manipulation of the numbers.  Either explanation points to near-term disaster.  
The only other possibility I can think of is that the USD is displacing local currencies around the world, which is definitely possible.  That would explain the anomalously low interest rates despite the massive infusion of artificial liquidity into the system.  Aside from massive yet stealthy wealth displacement, this has an additional downside - it creates an increasingly large pool of circulating USD, and thus even greater institutional inertia into the current monetary regime.  
This increased inertia results in the Fed binding it's own hands in order to extend it's hegemony - every minute change in policy threatens to reverberate in unpredictable ways, and thus the status-quo ($85B/month printed from thin air) becomes harder and harder to change.  If anything, they'll need to increase that number. The Fed already can't make a reasonable guess as to exactly *how* much USD is actually circulating in the world, so they have no way to measure what actual inflation this is causing.
The Fed's blind spot to the total money supply is where they are most vulnerable, yet seemingly paradoxically, where they continue to increase their exposure.  Because they are effectively blind there, they leave it out of their calculations, both monetary and political.
So the reaction to this in 5-10 years will be interesting - there is *no* way that the USD can withstand an additional 10 years of the status quo without both inflation and the failure of monetary policy to affect employment to become so glaringly apparent that it can no longer be ignored regardless of how sycophantic media coverage is.
The opportunity of the Fed employing cryptocurrency and blockchain technology to replace the current USD will become both more pressing in urgency and more remote in possibility as years pass.  These next few years will be interesting to watch, and to see which prevails at the Fed: will the next generation enable a smooth transition to a more advanced monetary system, or will the sclerotic and calcified institutional power holders refuse to adapt, and eventually go down with the ship?

It's the most powerful dedicated computing system/network, but it's not capable of being repurposed. Supercomputers are usually measured in petaflops, because they tend to be aimed at floating-point intensive tasks. Hashing is actually far simpler than fp calculations, but floating point processors can hash, while hashing ASICs can't do floating point. 
It's kinda like comparing apples to oranges - and not even oranges, but vitamin C capsules. ASIC hashes and the Bitcoin network as a whole are highly optimized to do hashing, to the point where they can't do anything else. So supercomputers can't hold a candle to the Btc network power, but the Bitcoin network can't do what supercomputers do. 
Basically, it's a really poor comparison to put hashing power up against general processing power. 
@_date: 2013-02-01 04:07:53
No, it adjusts at each block. Not quite 'real time', but timely enough for practical adjustments right now. I suppose it's possible for a malicious miner with massive hashing power to constantly cause the hash rate to fluctuate wildly, but that's unlikely in the near term, and less likely as the hash rate increases.

If it was centralized, there would be no need for a proof-of-work verification; the central authority would be able to oversee verification. Mining is pointless in that context, so what you're left with is a cryptographic signature for transfer and centralized signature for acceptance. The total number of coins would be under the control of the central authority, so it becomes a standard fiat currency, but with somewhat stronger theft protection (but not protection from devaluing). Central authority would also have significant privacy implications.

I think you're right in regards to a BFL delivery strengthening the network as a whole, but I'm referring to the individual miners in terms of how it will affect their ROI.  As I see it, the first BFL deliveries will mark the closing of the early adopter window (for ASICMiner too - their profitability will fall correspondingly).  After that, it's about capital investment and cost management to keep treading water for mining operations.  Until quantum computers arrive, there won't be any ASIC-style disruptions in the network.  
Granted, all of that could be throw out the window by a massive swing in the exchange rate, but as things stand now, I see the BFLs improving the network as a whole in both the short and long term, but not disproportionately profiting their individual customers the way we're seeing from jgarzik's Avalon or the ASICMiner that's at 2TH/s ATM.

IIRC, scrypt is memory intensive, not computationally intensive - so ASICs won't help much, if at all.  The only way to speed up memory-hard problems is to increase memory.  
Scrypt works by calculating a large number of values (similar to a block chain cipher), then accessing them pseudorandomly - doing that quickly requires a large amount of memory because a system needs to keep as many values in memory as possible to access them quickly.  But the actual calculations are pretty simple - a standard CPU will require far less than 1% utilization on a 4-8GB pad of RAM to run scrypt - the latency required to access the memory will eat up the rest of the processing time.
One criticism of scrypt as proof-of-work is that it gives botnet controllers considerably greater incentive to use their botnet for 'mining' above what SHA/RIPE hashing does, because under SHA/RIPE proof of work, relatively small investment in specialized and dedicated hardware can make botnets low-profit or unprofitable to use (and heavy cpu/gpu usage attracts notice from even novice users), but the massive memory pool of a botnet will outstrip what even a relatively well-funded honest scrypt miner could match.  The counter-criticism of SHA/RIPE proof-of-work would be that specialized hardware for computation contributes to the centralization of the mining and makes it easier for a well-funded attacker to compromise the network, and widely adopted scrypt proof-of-work would be harder to subvert.
The trade-off between increasing speed thru memory or calculation is one of the oldest balancing acts in CompSci, and it's been driven in the past by the fact that the cost of computation has fallen exponentially while the cost of memory has only trended down linearly.  Consequently, memory-hard proof-of-work is far more expensive and harder to optimize than computationally-hard proof-of-work.  The Bitcoin vs. Litecoin debate is (academically, at least) an interesting manifestation of that particular see-saw.

Yep.  That's exactly it.  I'm pretty sure that block solutions will even out, but the ASIC rollout has made things move a bit faster than planned.  I wonder occasionally about how fluctuations in hash rate can affect Bitcoin, but I kinda doubt that it will matter much as the rate grows for a few more years.
@_date: 2013-03-01 00:56:07
It depends on how they have their farm setup.  If they're running ASICs, then those would be very difficult/inefficient to repurpose to computing other than SHA hashing.  If they're running GPUs, then those could very easily be repurposed to running other highly parallel computations (basically same as Amazon EC2 GPU cluster).  
Of course, a year from now, GPU mining probably won't be profitable - so redirecting existing resources to cloud-based services could be a good business plan for them.

One way I looked at it when I started with Bitcoin: as long as the Silk Road exists, Bitcoins will never be worth 0.  So long as they're not worth 0, Bitcoins will, on a long-term, deflate against other currencies.
Investment wise, it's not difficult to divine the long term trend based on fundamental economics.  Speculation wise, Bitcoin is a fundamentally unique combination of technology/currency/commodity, and legal/technological/practical hurdles could derail it at any point and drop it to effectively zero.  Exchange breaches and stolen wallets do not affect Bitcoin's fundamentals - they're not worth worrying about except as practical issues - any single user can guard against them; hostile legislation and concerted attacks against the p2p network ARE threats, and they're what needs to concern the Bitcoin community long-term.

Caveat Emptor, I suppose.  You could sue them, but after the plaintiff's lawyer's fees, all you'd have is a bankrupt company that the founders already bled dry of everything their own lawyers didn't get first.  BFL is a small fish to the FTC - not worth swimming after.  BFL would simply claim that they delays are common in the ASIC industry (true), and that the hash rate increased far faster than projected (also true).
Besides, these types of cases don't get prosecuted unless:
1. The FTC is looking to make a political statement/send a message to some group/industry
2. The case gets an anomalous amount of media attention due to some attention-grabbing factor (race/gender discrimination or 99% vs 1%)
3. The wheels are properly greased thru donations and/or contracts for connected companies to ensure a prosecution is initiated.  However, this can also work in reverse to prevent a prosecution, and it becomes a matter of who has the deeper pockets. 
Because BTC has govt' attention right now, it's possible that point 1 might get something started.  
Point 2 could factor in slightly as long as BTC (and the exchange rate) stays in the headlines, but after pirateat40 and Silk Road, I don't think that would have staying power.  
Point 3 could definitely come into play if banks believe they could delegitimize BTC as a whole by forcing prosecution of prominent BTC companies.

That's a bit harsh - one: it's VITAL that irregularities and possible scams be reported quickly if Bitcoin is to survice - two:  Bitcoin is a zero-trust system; that means that any where in the system that you're 'trusting' someone, you're opening yourself up to scams.  Coinbase is working on building trust, and that's never easy or flawless for even the most honest operators - but unless we can openly report hiccups, potential fraud, or possible unethical practices, it will be impossible to ever distinguish an honest company from a dishonest one.
It's virtually impossible that Coinbase (assuming they're operating honestly) is going to get everything right on the first go round - and we need people reporting on their flaws as well as their successes, not just for the sake of Bitcoin, but for Coinbase too.

The 'Trust' holder would be superfluous - if any individual investor followed the same plan, they'd make the same return on their initial investment. 
Basically, you set the payout levels to numbers that are 'meaningful' to people beyond their actual numerical value - first payout is 1/2 million, next payout is 3/2 million... etc.  
If someone only has enough bitcoins to put in 10% of the initial investment, then their portion of the payout is %10 of 1/2 million ( or 1/20 million), minus the 1% for the trust keeper.  But if they just kept the bitcoins themselves, then they get the same return, and they don't need to payout the 1% to the trust keeper.
Aggregating the bitcoins may make the numbers look more impressive to an outside observer, but it gives no additional benefit to the individual investor.  In order for a 'Trust' to be worthwhile, they need to be able to manage the wealth in order to either protect or increase it - that means standard wealth and investment management^1.  In that sense, 'wealth' isn't just currency, but landholdings, corporate stocks, government bonds, various currencies and commodities, etc.
Bitcoins, as a deflationary currency, can potentially be a strong *part* of a wealth management strategy, but just dumping money into a bitcoin "Trust" then paying out at some indeterminate and somewhat arbitrary time doesn't add value versus simply holding the coins yourself.
^1. I'm referring to good, old-fashioned portfolio strategy here, not Lehman Brothers/Goldman Sachs style hyper-leverage/market manipulation.

Well, the ASICs increase the barrier for entry for *mining*, but they do not really increase the entry barrier for participating in the bitcoin economy in general - MtGox and now Coinbase seem to be providing a very easy entry for non-technical users, and if more vendors start accepting bitcoin, then the usage rate will increase proportionately.
In many ways, it's going to be a wash in terms of ASIC mining - the hashing technology proceeded from general-use CPU to GPU to FPGA to ASIC in just over 4 years (genesis block was Jan 3 2009, IIRC) - that's stunningly fast when you stop to think about it.  Now the technological portion of the hash-rate arms race will plateau for a while; we'll see some optimizations and better power-consumption while the current ASICs catch up to the lower-nanometer state-of-the-art ASICS, but the huge jump from FPGA to ASIC is highly unlikely to be repeated.
Long term, no, the increased hash rate of the ASICs will NOT increase the income for the average miner considerably - only the early adopters and the very first to get their ASICs will reap the early-window benefits (I'd call them lucky bastards, but 'luck' has very little to do with who has ASICs at the moment).  What the ASICs will do that will positively benefit the miners is that they will help stabilize and strengthen the cryptographic difficulty of the network as a whole, so it will be more difficult to launch attacks against the network - that will allow more financial 'bandwidth' (for lack of a better word) to be carried by Bitcoin.  
The stronger the network, the more difficult to launch attacks, the more secure bitcoins are as wealth storage and transfer, the more *valuable* bitcoins will become, and thus the return the miners reap will be greater in real terms, even though their actual bitcoin yield will not increase in the long term.

I think you're misunderstanding - that 60GH/s *is* sustained - it's just inefficient.  You could adjust the numbers from complete computation on one end (like my example), to a theoretically-perfect system that hashes the complete set and keeps it in memory, which (in 256 bit space) would require a memory bank roughly the size of Mars, give or take a few moons.  
The entire basis of most modern crypto is built around finding problems which are not (mathematically speaking) very difficult to solve, but which are simply *impractical* to crack because there are no short-cuts, and the size of the problem can be scaled arbitrarily.  Public/Private Key encryption, for example, is based around prime integer factoring, which can be understood by an attentive 10 year old.
Memory doesn't get cheaper nearly as fast as computation does - that's the dynamic that's driven the industry for the past few decades: Memory is expensive but CPU cycles are cheap.  Scrypt was designed to work *against* that trend, and make a crypto hash that was not just hard to break, but *expensive* in memory (and thus in monetary) terms to brute-force.
Just for clarification, I'm *not* saying dedicated hardware can't be built for scrypt, I'm just saying that any hardware built for it will necessarily be far more expensive for the end-user than comparable dedicated equipment built for computationally intensive work.  Memory is far more expensive than CPU, and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future.

The catch is that it's difficult to run it profitably - the most widely available hardware (GPUs - aka, video cards) is falling behind in terms of efficiency - FPGAs are better, but they require additional expertise to setup.  ASICs are only just now rolling out:
* Avalon delivered first, but they produced a small number and are hugely back-ordered.  You can find pre-ordered Avalons available on EBay for roughly a 10x mark-up - not actual ASICs, mind you, just the preorder
* ASICMiner was second, but they don't deliver to consumers; they financed their ASIC mining production by selling shares to investors.  If you look around, you can probably find someone selling shares, but they're marked up a few hundred% over original price also, IIRC.
* Bringing up the rear is Butterfly Labs (BFL) - they were one of the first to announce products, and have yet to deliver a single production ASIC miner.  They have a long history of missing production dates; they finally demo'd an unfinished ASIC last week that underperformed both in terms of giga-hash (GH) targets and GH/Watt performance.  They'll probably deliver at least partially, but their history of over-promising will haunt them for a good while to come, at least reputation-wise.  They released another pre-order run with lowered GH targets and doubled price, and I don't think they'll have trouble selling them.
Avalon has actually delivered, but their power efficiency is several times worse than BFL's unfinished demo ASIC.  However, BFL's production targets and backorder list is larger than what either Avalon or ASICMiner has, so they may end up producing more hash power if they actually start shipping.  ASICMiner hasn't released too much info on GH/Watt performance AFAIK, but I've seen core devs discussing ASICMiner plans to deploy 200 Tera-hashes in the next few months.
AFAIK, every other ASIC company that has popped up has turned out to be out-and-out scams.  "ASIC Prime" was a recent one that tried selling based on pictures of Avalons they posted.
Ok... I think that's it - that is the current state of Bitcoin ASICs.  It's something of a gold rush, but those who have been around have a prohibitive advantage compared to newcomers.

Unregulated free markets lead to temporary monopolies.  In any true free market, the monopolistic abuses lead to inefficiencies which eventually cause it to collapse under it's own weight.  The monopoly is then replaced by decentralized services, which then fight for market share until one starts to emerge as a monopoly.  The cycle starts again.
Entrenched monopolies always require either a government to enforce their monopoly, or need to pay off the government to either look the other way and/or participate while they use force to kneecap competitors (see: Pinkertons).  But that's oligarchy, not free market.  Truly free markets, like socialism, can't exist for long before the real world intrudes.
Bitcoin is an new technology attempting to establish an emerging market - so for a while it's behavior will highly resemble the actions of a theoretical free, unregulated market (but in modern day high speed).  That means that early adopters and services can quickly gain a large % of market share, becoming near-monopolies.  But because it is an *emerging* market, those monopolies are very fragile and can easily collapse or be overtaken, close to how a theoretical free-market monopoly would behave.  In the meantime, Bitcoin (and especially exchanges) will be subject to every kind of manipulation possible under a free market.
Bottom line: it's going to be a bumpy ride.

With all due respect, as long as you keep talking about brute-forcing a 256 bit search space as if it is physically feasible within this solar system (let alone a data center in Utah), nobody is going to take you seriously.
Second, insofar as this is a crypto problem, yes it *is* of interest whether or not the range of SHA256 actually covers the full 256 bit space, and it is not trivial to prove it.  I would guess that it *does*, but guesses are scarcely relevant to the discussion - the fact that nobody has yet found a way to limit the space efficiently may be a practical reason to trust the hash, but it is *NOT* a legitimate mathematical argument (or even a very profound observation), and it is most certainly not (as you claim) a *proof*.
Yes, it is an important part of a cryptographic hash that it achieves a requisite degree of entropy - but that is not the question that was being asked.  The question was whether or not it is possible to derive ALL values contained in a 256 bit space thru SHA256 - that has very little to do with entropy from small input changes, but is still a valid line of inquiry to the quality of a cryptographic hash function.  As it relates to the practical purpose of deriving nonce values in bitcoin, it is something of an edge case, but still remains an deeply profound theoretical question.  
Your dismissal of the issue shows only that you don't recognize an interesting question when you see one.

Yeah - terminology gets wonky when discussing complex systems :).

There's the Bitcoin Protocol itself - not the code, but the rules the code *should* follow
There's the Blockchain - the eternal Bitcoin ledger back to the genesis block
And the Bitcoin network - the interactions of the network that curates the Blockchain
So... the root cause here was a bug in a widely-used client (0.7) which was exposed by an expanded feature in a new client (0.8), which caused the main Blockchain to be forked by the Bitcoin network.  So, the network and the Blockchain operated perfectly to spec, and the mass-cooperation of the mining guilds allowed for the clients to interoperate smoothly once again (for the time being) to mitigate the bug in the old client so that a smoother (hopefully planned) upgrade may be done at a later date.

I'm primarily a software guy, so I don't know exactly what the machines in the pics are - if they're genuine fabrication machines or if they're some older obsolete models that could be bought at auction for pennies on the dollar - either way, that would be a few thousand (and more likely tens of thousands of) dollars for purchase and transportation/installation.  Renting the office/warehouse space is another couple thousand per month, even in an area with relatively low real-estate prices like KC.  The pics depict a few hundred fans and I'm counting around 25 customized chassis in the pics alone; not the most complicated thing to produce, but not trivial either. The cardboard boxes would be the easy part- they could just be empty or full of old books or something - that's cheap. However, stocking the office/production line with fake boxes, chassis, and fans would be pretty elaborate for a scammer.
Overall, with a bit of luck and cooperation from an unwitting/absentee landlord, it's perfectly possible to put up a front like this for somewhere in the vicinity of $25-50k (depending on how much is being run on confidence and how much on cash flashing), leaving plenty of preorder money left.
Plus, the plane could be a get-away vehicle :).
More seriously.... if BFL is a scam, then it's a pretty well-constructed one - doesn't look like they're doing it on the cheap.  For all the work they're putting in, they may as well do the real thing.  Plus, fooling an experienced dev like Kanoi isn't the easiest thing to do, but he might be a software guy (like me) and not really know what he's looking at.

I think what you're describing is 'going viral', or, in Gladwellian terms, the 'tipping point'.  
Bitcoin's exchange rate has closely mirrored related search - and the exchange rate has probably driven search in return - that creates a feedback loop (and feedback loops are inherently unstable because exponential/geometrical growth is non sustainable outside of theory).  
So, the question is, has bitcoin gone viral yet?  Has it reached the tipping point?  Will it?  Or will it sputter out like other promising but ahead-of-their-time technologies have?
It might be useful to look at Bitcoin as a new *technology* rather than a commodity or even a currency.  The most important indicator isn't the exchange rate or even transaction rate - it's the adoption and acceptance rate.  If it gains critical mass (0.5%? 1%? 10%?), then it can very quickly explode in acceptance.  None of this, however, allows us to predict the if, when, where, or how of Bitcoin adoption.
I'm not knocking Kurzweil or his model - but it suffers from the same major flaw that most other economic models have: While it's explanatory power on the macro scale is satisfying and attractive, it's predictive power on any individual technology/product/project is close to nil.

There are some ways of mitigating and countering 51% attacks that don't involve increasing hash power on the legit network - [Andresen]( has a short description here, but the first and best line of defense is the sheer difficulty and expense of matching then exceeding the total network power. 
Unless your friend has some pretty extensive and impressive analysis backing up that assertion, I'd dismiss it.  On the surface, he may be simply referring to the ability of the main network to distinguish between malicious and legitimate traffic (blocks with 0 transactions, all non-standard transactions, spam, etc.) - I think that's superficially true, but assumes that attackers won't improve their ability to disguise malicious traffic faster or as fast as the main dev's ability to distinguish it - that's *not* a strong assumption.
Anyway, I'm making guesses about what your friend might be implying, but I don't think he's correct - ideas/thinking along those lines seems to be rooted in concepts that are unnecessarily carried over from years of dealing with centralized systems, but I can't say without knowing more.

I would recommend that any government trying to setup their own crypto-currency take a good look at Freicoin (with some minor changes), as the demurrage built-in can act as a non-evadable tax if they simply establish themselves as the certifying authority.
However, no individual has any incentive to use Freicoin for pretty much the same reason - they do have incentives *not* to use it, tho.  The only incentive possible would be if a governmental authority required it.

This isn't that hard to explain - Coinbase is more of a sales vendor, not an exchange.  They purchase and sell Bitcoins directly, rather than enabling transactions between parties, like "normal" exchanges do.
At the moment, purchase demand is huge, but the price difference between US and China is even bigger - ~15%, last I checked.  If I'm Coinbase, then I don't sell a single bitcoin in the US right now - I transfer them all to BTC China, and do sales there.  If the people who run Coinbase are smart, then they're well-positioned to run arbitrage right now - and that means buying US-based BTC, not selling.
This might also be a smart move ahead of the Senate Hearing today.  If things go badly, then it behooves Coinbase to have as much BTC outside of the US as possible beforehand.  If things go well in the hearing, then the price of BTC shoots up even higher, and they can repatriate the BTC once the US exchange rates catch up.
Basically, Coinbase has no real incentive to sell in the US right now unless they mark up to $800 as of now, but then customers will start bitching about price gouging.
Edit: Just checked the exchange rate - as of 1:35 CST, the Yuan/BTC rate is 4725 - which translates to ~775 USD.  Why the *hell* would Coinbase sell a single BTC for 650 USD right now?  As I said, if they're smart enough to have been prepared for something like this, then they're running arbitrage right now, and they're making a killing in China.  Don't expect to hear back from them until Friday if you're in the US.

Fiat transfers between exchanges are too slow for effective arbitrage - Bitfloor has been several dollars above MtGox most times I check it, but not always.  It'll even itself out as the exchanges improve and multiply.
Bitfloor is a bit easier/faster to use at the moment (I'm not a MtGox hater, but they're getting slammed by good and bad traffic and it affects performance), so sellers there are able to get a higher price. 
Better customer service allows a seller to charge a premium... it's almost like a free market or something... weird, huh?

'Single point of failure' makes it sound more fragile than it is/was - the older clients couldn't handle a block which was valid under the protocol, so they rejected it.  The decision to do a mass-downgrade was achieved by majority consensus in order to give the 0.7 miners time to upgrade - it's worth noting that Gavin opposed the downgrade at first, because the 0.7 clients were rejecting a *valid* block.  But there was nothing forcing the 0.8 miners to downgrade - they had the majority, and they didn't *need* to do anything.
So, let's say that, hypothetically, the community majority opposed downgrading, and simply kept running 0.8.  What happens then?  Well, because the blockchain height was growing faster on 0.8, the 0.7 chain would have become more and more out-of-date. So they either upgrade, or become obsolete.  The blockchain merging takes a bit longer than it did, but Bitcoin marches on.
A more likely scenario is that there are eventually several different clients, (dozens, perhaps), none of which control the majority.  At that point, the protocol will be largely locked in, and "centralized" changes like we've seen will not be feasible without considerable warning.

No offense, but I think even that is naive.  Paradigm shifts don't happen overnight - but the speed at which they can happen is increasing at a dizzying rate... 
I think a good analogy for this might be the conniptions that many classical physicists went thru when Einstein first published relativity.  We like to think of science and scientists as eager to embrace newer, more elegant and powerful theories, but what happened is that many utterly rejected it because it violated thier preconceptions and prejudices - that's why he won a Nobel for Brownian Motion and the Photoelectric Effect instead of for the far more revolutionary theory of Relativity.  And that was with evidence staring the world of Science in the face... and they couldn't accept it because it was too different and forced them to abandon too much of their worldview.  There's an excellent quote that I can't manage to find about how Relativity didn't suddenly or even gradually turn skeptics into believers - it rang true to the newer, less-biased generation, and the old generation eventually died.
Bitcoin is obviously not as fundamental as Relativity and does not dwell directly in the realms of physics, but it is an ingenious solution to a financial issue that utilizes some of the most fundamental underpinnings of mathematical and computational theory to secure itself - it has the potential to impact the day-to-day life of people far more and far faster than something like Relativity or the Higgs Boson.  
It very much has the potential to displace much of the financial power structure that exists in the world today - the same power structure that is intertwined with governments from the most corrupt to the least corrupt - from the most repressive to the freest states.  That's the power structure we're going up against.  And our best chance for success is that they won't take us seriously until it's too late.  That's the danger - that's the risk.  That's the chance we're taking.  Everytime you cash out of USD or EUR for BTC, that's the bet you're making.  That eventually, the old will die and the new will win.

^This - when people say that a deflationary currency "doesn't work", what they really mean is "It doesn't work the way I want it to work".  Deflationary currency is *excellent* for storing and protecting wealth, and it amply rewards savers.  Consequently, it is very attractive to people who want to save and protect their wealth.  The downside to that is that all hard currencies are subject to deflationary spirals (as noted in many places elsewhere) which can hurt the economy as a whole.  But, even in deflationary spirals, the currency maintains it's value.
What Bitcoin (as a deflationary currency) does NOT do is incentivize spending, increase monetary velocity, (insert any modern economic metric here, etc, etc...) or do any of the things that governments use to measure economic "health".  
Historically, inflationary currencies have been able to induce economic activity by giving those *with* the currency a reason to get rid of it - it loses more value the longer you hold it.  So a rational John or Jane Doe has incentive to spend the money and thusly promote economic activity.  When this works, then you can (in theory, at least) encourage economic growth by partially funding it with a backdoor inflation tax on savers thru lost value.  This is what has more or less happened in the US since it was decoupled from the gold standard (with, IMHO, not too terrible results).  The downside to inflationary currencies is obviously that it penalizes savers, inflation is difficult to control, and it is always in danger of hyperinflation if the wrong people get put in charge of the printing presses.

Any ASIC miner should be watching his productivity, which would make infiltration of a mining production pretty hard.  It's one thing to steal cycles from a retiree who only uses the computer to check Facebook for pictures of their grandkids, and quite another to commandeer a dedicated mining rig/farm.  
That said, I'm dead certain it's possible to break security on a poorly-config'd rig, but any half-responsible miner would notice when GH/s or TH/s disappear from their farm, or that their block rewards are being redirected.
Basically, they'll still be able to use botnets to generate hashes at zero-electricity cost to themselves, but the return from those botnets will fall precipitously as the hash-rate increases.  They'll turn to concentrating on bots with high-end GPUs attached, but that decreases their pool of victims considerably (and forces them to target a more tech-savvy and attentive victim), and since GPU mining will attract less attention from the rest of the coding world moving forward, an increasing portion of the coding burden will fall on the botnet controllers to maintain the GPU drivers and the mining software to adapt to new cards - that's *not* an easy tide to fight against. On top of that, manipulating the driver and monopolizing the GPU of a computer produces graphics slowdowns and errors - and that's a very obvious symptom and usually the first thing even non-technical users notice when something's wrong.
I'm reasonably sure that even large botnets will NOT generate very large hash rates unless they have GPUs attached, and that kind of malware is difficult to maintain.  As the return on the mining botnet decreases, the difficulty of maintaining the bot software will increase.
Just for reference, a generic CPU will generate about 2.4MH/s - so it'll take a ~40,000 node botnet to match an Avalon rig.  So, it's definitely possible, but the difficulty of capturing, deploying, and maintaining botnet is likely to outweigh the cost of simply purchasing a dedicated ASIC.  They'll probably find it easier to stick to things like spam and information/identity theft.
It's difficult to find very many hard facts when analyzing something like this, but one telling sign is that there are few botnets out there that deploy mining software, and as far as I know, only BadMiner attempted to use GPU - but it produced noticeable effects on the victim's system and was only seen in the wild a few times - [Symantec]( (I know, I know, don't criticize - it's the only reference I have on this) still has badminer listed as under 50 infections in the wild even after almost 2 years.

Assuming there's even enough interest, it's a bad idea.  One of the biggest threats to bitcoin is government regulation or enforcement of bans.  Bitcoin's essence is that it's an implementation/protocol of money in it's most abstract form (decoupled from Mises' regression) - I get the feeling that very few people appreciate just how extraordinarily strong an idea that is, but the community and systems that support it are still very young - I don't want to use the word 'immature', but I don't think that bitcoin could currently survive a concerted effort by the US or EU government to shut it down.  The best way for bitcoin to overcome this hurdle is to continue to mature and grow under the radar as much as possible - by the time a major government takes it seriously, it needs to be too late for them to do anything about it.  Regulators currently look at bitcoin (when they deign to notice it) as a joke or as pure money laundering/ponzi scheme barely worth their time.  The longer they continue to think that, the better.

And 'dumping' the coins at that point would be pointless - they'd have a *huge* profit on their hands if they decided to manage it responsibly instead of dumping it - their incentives would shift *massively*... it's likely their course of action would change to match.

"Nonce" is an abbreviation of "number once".  Wikipedia has a run-down [here](  Basically, they're used to create random initialization vectors for stream ciphers and to salt passwords; they're also used in lamport signatures for verification similar to (but weaker than) EC signing.  Usage of a nonce for proof-of-work looks to be a recent innovation, and is used most notably in Bitcoin itself.

Coins will still be produced at the same rate - any early ASIC hashers will have a huge statistical advantage in gathering those coins.  The hashing difficulty is adjusted automatically to account for the extra hashing power, but because ASICs should have so much more hashing power, early adopters will have a window in which they will be taking the lion's share of the block rewards (10 BTC every 10 minutes or so).

Heh... I'm still holding out on calling them a scam - they've obviously have no concept of timelines, but bad estimates and massive delays happen even in companies that have far more experience and resources.
Transparency is a double-edged sword - BFL is obviously responding to outside criticism and customer impatience by releasing semi-regular status updates, but that allows everyone to see all the flaws.  It's like watching sausage being made, or close-up porn in HD.  It's not always pretty.
I'm not seeing anything (in terms of delays and setbacks) from BFL that is unheard of in product development, but I'm also not seeing the kind of information and transparency that I would need to comfortably purchase from them given their track record of breaking delivery commitments.  Independent verification from manufacturers? Design review from independent engineers? Timelines that reflect verifiable commitments from manufacturers and contractors?  Financial statements reflecting total preorder payments vs. liabilities and delivery requirements? Bueller? Bueller?
I continue to watch them because the Bitcoin community needs a company to produce what they're advertising, but from the outside looking in, I feel like they're playing out just enough line to allow the fish to hook themselves - hope I'm wrong, but that's what it *feels* like to me.

Quite a few points from there are almost directly adopted from Bitcoin - or even from protocols that preceded Bitcoin.  I don't think it would be difficult to assert prior-art on this.
The patent is describing what's already done with typical bitcoin account but without the decentralization - I'm pretty sure this was already described by hashcash even before Bitcoin, but I'm not 100% on BTC pre-history.. the "accessing the computer memory" part is kinda hilarious, actually.

Yes... but everything you said there was true about Bitcoin not too long ago.
I don't think there's going to be another economic "Bitcoin" phenomena in the near future - litecoin comes closest due to the targeting of memory rather than computation as the limiting factor in mining - but it's still the wannabe pretender's silver to Bitcoin's gold.  AFAIK, that's purely an acceptance factor, tho.
Altcoins can still function as the near anonymous currency that bitcoin once was, since they're nowhere near as popular/studied and crytocoin-to-cryptocoin exchange is still easier than cryptocoin-to-fiat.  But I don't think we'll see the same explosion in value except on Bitcoin's coattails.

Or, in an alternate world (where the DDOS attacks and HFT floods happened three days later), you could have bought in at 200 then cashed out at 500.
Don't be foolish enough to think you can predict the peaks and valleys (unless you've got the power to cause them) - either get in because you think the technology has long term potential above it's current valuation, or leave it alone and take your significant other out to a nice dinner instead.

It's definitely possible (51% always wins in the long run), but it will become increasingly hard to do as Bitcoin grows.  
Any mechanism that allows for blatantly stolen coins to be returned involves reversing or ignoring a transaction... and bitcoin is engineered to make that as difficult as possible. If the vast majority of the network DID agree to 'blacklist' one transaction, then what's to stop the blacklisting cabal from implementing a general blacklist? 
There ARE some arguments for such a mechanism to prevent transactions that are obviously fraudulent - but it's a dangerous precedent.
It's possible that a protocol could be added to make certain addresses "cold" in that they can't be drained without first issuing warning or something like that... but that could be implemented as is with multiple signatures IIRC...
Anyway - it's an interesting problem, but I haven't seen a proposal yet that really solves the problem without weakening bitcoin as a whole.

The dollar is too probably entrenched to undergo a sudden dramatic collapse - I think that when a collapse finally becomes apparent to people who deal in USD only, they'll stand up, look around, and slowly start to realize that it collapsed a long time ago.
The USD is currently "inflating" very little (under 2% if you believe the official figures), despite the massive Quantitative Easing (aka, money printing) undertaken by the Fed.  The only way that can happen is if :
* The USD is quietly displacing other forms of currency in the world market.
* Massive amounts of money are being destroyed (defaulted upon) 
* Money is being removed from the economy through savings/hoarding.
If defaulting is the primary cause of low inflation, then the QE will primarily result in transfer of wealth from savers to the Government (or Fed/Banks - they're all kinda the same since they're the ones who get the printed money first), and hyperinflation is unlikely since the money can't suddenly flood the wider market - the slow steady inflation we've gotten used to is more likely.  Standard monetary policy can usually handle this sort of inflation without inducing Revolution by the proles.
However, if Savers/Hoarders and currency displacement are the primary cause of the lack of inflation, then there is a massive amount of paper/virtual paper money out there circulating.  If there's ever a crisis of confidence in the dollar, then they can flood the market and cause a sudden and "unexpected" hyperinflation.  No currently accepted monetary policy would be able to prevent this.

Fair enough - there's the old quote that I saw thrown around quite a bit before the crash "Nobody every went broke taking a profit".  
...but, just for imaginations sake, let's go back to that alternate universe, but instead of the flood happening three days later, it happens a day or two sooner, and BTC pops at 190 - both that and the hypothetical pop at 500 would have been completely within the realm of the possible.  
My point was simply that you can't predict the timing - if things had been different by mere hours, then someone would be lecturing you because they had cashed out at 180 instead of 200. ...and you'd be sitting at your laptop telling *that* guy about how bubbles can't be predicted and how thin the margin between profit and loss is and how everything comes down to "luck".  
Obviously, I don't know when you got in, but, bottom line, if you're not counting on luck, then you don't get into an overheated market at all - you don't speculate *period*.  IMHO, the market started overheating somewhere below 40... and I'm sure I can find someone who thought that 30 was reached a bit quick.   But I will never claim to be able to predict the peaks and valleys of manias, and I sure as hell won't bet on them.
I originally got into BTC to use it, not to speculate on it. Watching the exchange rate it has been quite a sideshow, but it's made me extraordinarily glad that I'm not active in it.  Wall Street traders must have the coronary systems of Olympic athletes to do that on a daily basis.  It stressed me out just following it.

I think it's more accurate to say that the lack of multiple interacting clients is a threat to decentralization - this has been brought up before.  There was a Java client, bitcoinj, but it's not too widely used (yet, I hope - even tho I hate Java).
Gavin's implementation is considered the 'reference' simply because it's the most widely used, and, as we saw with the fork, small changes can have a big impact if they're not correctly thought-out.  
Ideally, another couple of implementations will come out, and the interactions between those will help spur the development of a true protocol - the Bitcoin Foundation can only be helpful in that.  
Yes, I think it's a potential problem, but not one that is insoluble or even unlikely to be solved. I think it will just take some time.

From my perspective, it's been emotionally exhausting - and I don't really have too much financially at stake - my BTC holdings are mostly self-mined coins and some very minimal investment that I made just to test out exchange sites.
Quite frankly, the run-up scared the crap out of me - I've been of the opinion for a long time that, while BTC has world-changing potential, the most dangerous thing possible for the system is to see too many people jump into our relatively tiny financial pool too soon.  It's like a current surge frying a circuit - a pop was inevitable, but it's impossible to predict how high it will get, how quickly it will pop, and how low it will go.  That's why all the "bubble" talk was so frustrating to see thrown around - viewed on a long enough timeline, *everything* goes thru bubbles, and so far, even the best experts are 0 for infinity on calling the timing.
I can't imagine what it must be like to be someone who invested a considerable amount near the peak - I feel bad for them, but I have a hard time truly sympathizing.  I can't imagine investing in something I didn't understand - when I first discovered BTC two years ago, I spent *months* studying the crypto behind it - and I *still* get things wrong when discussing it.
Really, the run-up stressed me because I felt like so many people were jumping on the bandwagon that my little mining pool was going to get swamped if I didn't do massive work on it *fast*.  That's what was stressing me out - not the exchange rate.  Now that things have popped, I feel sososososo sooo much better... I can peruse code at my own pace and not worry about deploying in the next five minutes or losing out forever.

You're completely right - my apologies.  I've been giving myself a crash course in cryptography after not touching it for a decade, and it's getting a bit crowded up in my neurons.  Thanks for the correction!


My guess is that it wouldn't - but 10 minutes is an average, if I'm not mistaken.  I've had transactions take up to 24 hours to confirm.  In general, I actually think that Bitcoin is *superior* to check/debit/credit transactions for online shopping, because, as you mentioned, those can be reversed - a big strength of traditional transactions for shopping is that they can be done in seconds (near-instant gratification!), but they require a high overhead for reducing fraud/chargebacks.  But for websites, delivery is usually a few days out anyway, so taking 10 minutes for confirmation makes almost no difference whatsoever (Thank you for your purchase - you will receive a confirmation email shortly) - I would think it wouldn't even affect overnight deliveries considerably, because packages can be recalled if necessary (thanks to modern tracking) in the event of an attempted double-spend.  But same-day delivery could prove tricky - really tho, it's more of a logistic problem than a technological one, so I'm sure it'll get ironed out eventually.

If it moves, tax it.  If it keeps moving, regulate it.  If it stops moving, subsidize it.
...They won't be able to stop it, so they'll attempt to tax and regulate it.  At that point, the Bitcoin economy will be self-contained enough that regulating exchanges won't matter much.  So, in order to regulate bitcoin, they'll need to regulate mining. 
Step 1: Mining registration - you know - just for basic census purposes.  They promise that the information will never be used for any nefarious or coercive ends.  No reasonable person could object.
Step 2: "Minimal" and "Common sense" mining regulations.  Independent mining won't be banned (they'd *never* do that - you're just paranoid), but non-registered miners will be harassed and cracked down on in other ways.
Step 3: Slightly more regulation and oversight; but don't worry - it's for the overall good of Bitcoin - preventing 51% attacks, and managing hard forks, managing networks, etc.  It just makes everything better for everyone if there's some reasonable oversight - right?
Step 4: After a market crash, legislators and "the public" start agitating for more controls over the harsh, unforgiving, and unregulated bitcoin market.  Individual mining will be banned - can you believe they ever let some college kid in a garage do this stuff? This is far too important for government *not* to be involved - all these crazies talking about leaving the system free are just out of date and not paying attention to what's going on in the world today...

Basically, the capabilities and feasibility of quantum computations is pretty speculative at the moment.  It's theoretically believed that QCs could efficiently factor large numbers, which would break encryption not just for bitcoin, but for almost every widely used encryption scheme in existence.  So, it's not 'Bitcoin would be obsolete', it's 'Every security scheme in the world would be obsolete'.  
There ARE some encryption ciphers (such as NTRU) which are believed to be resistant to QC, but since QC is undeveloped, work on implementations moves slowly - basically, there's no demand for it.
It's worth noting that QC is NOT going to just leap out into the world completely formed like Minerva - if it's going to be developed, it will be developed slowly, with the number of qubits increasing slowly. 
The maximum as of 2000 was 7 qubits by Los Alamos and in 2012 was 14 qubits by [Cornell]( (D-Wave and other dubious groups have claimed as high as 300, but that would enabled them to break crypto *now*, and that hasn't happened - they can be dismissed as gross exaggerations).
Factoring SHA will require 256 quibits under ideal conditions, so even under ideal Moore's law-style conditions, we're 5 doubles out from being in danger (And doubling in QC is happening in 12 years right now, not 1).
Even if things move far more quickly, QC that can threaten Bitcoin is decades away.  If it actually starts to look like QC will scale, then there will be a massive amount of study dedicated to QC-resistant crypto - and this will be done on behalf of EVERY government, banking system, University, and security firm - EVERYONE will need to update their crypto, not just Bitcoin.  And, one important part of Bitcoin is that the crypto algs *can* be changed, as long as they have the same basic signature functions currently accomplished by SHA-256 and ECDSA.  
If Bitcoin needs to adapt to QC, it can.  If it's still around when QC comes around, it will.

Ok... from your 'vague' statements, I'm getting two possibilities:
1. Your friend thinks he can speed CUDA up enough to get a 15% improvement over existing mining implementations.
2. Your friend thinks he can speed up general SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160 algorithm by 15%.
In case 1, your friend may know enough about CUDA to be able to streamline existing calls and/or parallelization for hashing; this could potentially speed up GPU hashing, so it's not completely crazy, but would have zero effect on ASIC hashing. No feasible GPU speedup would allow it to compete with an ASIC of comparable clock speed and bus width.
In case 2, your friend thinks he can fundamentally speed up cryptographic hash algorithms; again, this is not *completely* crazy, but modern cryptographic hashes are based around NP problems - breaking them is the mathematical equivalent of discovering cold fusion or building a perpetual motion machine.  It's widely believed (but not proven) that, mathematically, they can't be broken - that's why we consider them secure.

They're legit, but they're new - so a bit of patience may be required when dealing with them.  It's easy to buy a small number of coins from them, but it's time consuming, and they have a bad habit of canceling at the last minute.
Most of their problems appear to be growing pains and an overabundance of regulatory caution rather than unethical practices.  I've bought a few dozen coins from them (at rates between ~19 and ~25) just to test out the system - I had one transaction canceled, but I emailed them about it, and they responded within 24 hours and restored the transaction at the exchange rate I ordered at.  I find them satisfactory so far, but they've got lots of room to improve on their service.

There's a couple of ways to look at it - if the network had refused to move back to 0.7, then the 0.8 chain would have continued to outgrow the old chain, and eventually, the 0.7s would have had to update to 0.8 or get left hopelessly behind.  The 'hard fork' that's been discussed would happen sooner than planned, and Bitcoin would continue on despite the chain fork flash crash.  
The 'centralization' here is pretty much just a courtesy to the 0.7 miners - in software circles (and Bitcoin is run very much by software people), deference is often given to backwards compatibility even at the expense of 'correctness'.  And that's what's being done here.  There is enough communication and connectedness between the mining consortiums that a concerted effort to move the majority of hashing power onto the older implementation is still feasible - the majority *will* listen to core devs.  If that was not the case, then the 0.7 clients would simply need to upgrade or die - survival of the fittest, and Darwin wins again.  
But Bitcoin would continue on, unaffected.

@_date: 2013-11-02 16:18:08
Nothing, really. But even precious metals don't really have anything "backing" them.  What backs gold?  It's inedible, it's been industrially useless for the vast majority of it's history, and was used primarily in jewelry, which is also useless.
What made gold valuable was it's limited supply.  When commerce began, barter was done with usable commodities such as wheat/cattle/slaves.  Merchants slowly advanced from bartering and began using go-betweens to simplify the transactions.  Early traders used everything from shiny rocks (jewels) to shark's teeth to sea shells as "money".
One thing to note is that these early forms of money represented an abstraction of the concept of *value*.  It's also worth noting that almost everything that has been used as money has been essentially worthless in terms of actual survival.
Another thing to understand is that "value" has no fixed definition.  Value varies from person to person, and that's part of what makes trade possible.  If everyone valued all commodities in exactly the same way, then trade would grind to a halt (theoretically, anyway... it's not a stable equilibrium).
In early forms of monetary trade, precious metals, and gold in particular, became the preferred form of money for several reasons: it was difficult to forge, it had relatively stable supply, it was relatively compact (for ease of transport), and those advantages led to a preference cascade, leading to it's universality in acceptance.  This *acceptance* of inherent value is probably the most important factor, but paradoxically, the one that is least physical - it's a purely psychological factor - aka, one without "backing".
This psychological factor has persisted so long that people rarely question the actual value of the metal itself.  People ask what's "backing" a money supply in terms of precious metals, without actually asking *what's backing the precious metals themselves?*  Industrial use of gold, silver, and platinum only justify a *fraction* of their actual trading value - cents on the dollar, if that.
In the same way that precious metals functioned as an abstraction of the concept of commodity *value*, Bitcoin represents an abstraction of the concept of *money* itself.
Ideal money requires a few attributes :
* it must be durable (won't spoil like food)
* It should be divisible 
* It should be easy to use (must be easier than barter)
* It should be consistent - every unit should be identical (unlike real estate or cattle)
* It should have a stable supply
* It should have acceptance everywhere
Bitcoin hits almost perfectly on every one of these points, except for the last one.  (That last one, of course, is the most important, which is what makes Bitcoin risky as an investment).
Bitcoin is digital, which makes it as durable as the digital age itself; Bitcoin is highly divisible, and may be infinitely divisible in the future; Bitcoin transactions are easy once one has a good app, and transactions are final within 10 minutes, whereas debits and credit transactions are not final for up to 90 days.  Every bitcoin is, of course, exactly the same as every other bitcoin, so there's no issue with consistency.  The Bitcoin supply is both stable and very predictable, although it has been increasing faster than expected due to rapid ASIC rollouts.
And the acceptance part is up to us.
People often don't realize just what a revolutionary and powerful idea *money* itself is and was.  All of economics and modern finance has sprung from the idea encapsulated in the exchange when a caveman first accepted a shiny rock for a leg of mastodon.  Bitcoin itself is an abstraction of the fundamentals of *money itself*... and the power of that idea is what I'm seeing when I invest in Bitcoin.  There is absolutely no way that dollars, euros, or *any* centrally controlled currency can compete on an even field with a digital currency like Bitcoin.  This is email vs. snail mail.  This is telephone vs. telegraph.  Mammals vs. Dinosaurs.
This isn't even a competition, just a waiting game.  
Edit : changed Dinosaurs vs. mammals to Mammals vs dinosaurs.  My bad.

Heh... I'm kinda stoked about Coinbase being as popular as it is, but it's also bringing out all their flaws - I'm trying to be very forgiving, as they're obviously experiencing some considerable growing pains, but seeing as how they are handling people's money, I'm of the opinion that they should proceed a bit more cautiously, particularly when dealing with unconfirmed transactions.
At any rate, I have a good gut feeling about them, as they've been responsive to my emails despite being obviously overwhelmed by demand, and they're carving out a strong niche for themselves in the Bitcoin economy.  All indications I see are that they're doing everything they can to operate honestly and openly, but they've got more than a few kinks to work out in the system.

I don't think it's valid to say they 'control' it - the core developers have a great deal of influence, but they can't control what miners do.  They have absolutely no authority to force anyone to use their version of the software, and they have absolutely no authority to prevent someone from creating a competing version.
The *only* "authority" they have is derived from their ability to get people to use *their* version.  Ultimately tho, the majority rules.  Calling them a central authority strains the definition.

First impression/thought - doesn't this strategy fall into the Gambler's Ruin?
Edit: subquestion - what happens with two "Selfish" miners - or when the dominant strategy becomes "Selfish" mining?  Doesn't honest or "Open" mining become dominant in that case?
Basically, if there are two "Selfish" miners running, then anyone who can run a node on both pools achieves an asymmetrical informational advantage, and can beat both pools. The "Selfish" miners would rely on their own pool being "Honest Selfish" miners.  
It doesn't seem like a stable strategy to me.  Am I missing something?

I've had that same thought - due to the limit on the # of transactions that can be done in a day, bitcoin will probably be used more as a wealth store than as a transactional currency.

Centralized crypto-currency is definitely possible - the central issuer would be the primary signer, and thus would replace the miners. Even the blockchain concept could be preserved.  But in this case, it would be a *highly* centralized and controlled currency - the possibility of anonymity is 0, and anyone's money would be trivially confiscatable with a keystroke.  Destroying someone's savings, income, and life would be easy for anyone who was near the spigot.  
Transparency for those in power would be impossible to achieve, and complete surveillance for everyone else would be impossible to escape.

True - it's just getting harder and harder to deny the true abstract nature of money as we get further into the information age.  The problems I have explaining Bitcoin to people stem almost exclusively from their inability to recognize that *all* money is fundamentally an abstraction.
@_date: 2013-02-03 22:36:29
You're not completely wrong - but the problem isn't as bad as you think.
First, any well-financed entity (think Goldman Sachs, the NSA, or CIA) can easily produced enough computing power to overtake the Bitcoin network.  Them's just the facts at the moment.  For the sake of brevity, I'll refer to these guys as Well-Financed Threats (WFTs).
However, the advent of ASICs means that well-financed entities have an ever-shrinking technological advantage over the individual miners - I believe the current Avalon ASICs are 110nm - the lowest silicon nm currently available for chips in general is, I think 28, and sub 20 is coming in the next few years.  Bitcoin will catch up with the state-of-the art chip fab faster than the state of the art will shrink.  This will eliminate the biggest advantage of the WFTs - the startup cost of producing the first chip.  Basically, ASICS - the super sonic high powered chips - do not make it easier to launch a 51% attack - they make it harder.
Currently, the computing power of the Bitcoin network corresponds to roughly 300 PetaFlops (Just FYI, PetaFLOPS to TeraHashes is not a good comparison, but it should help you with an idea of the scales involved) - for reference, the current Supercomputer champ, the Titan, clocks in at 17 PetaFlops.  I remember reading somewhere that the bitcoin network represents more dedicated computing power than the top 50 supercomputers combined (don't know where the link is, and too lazy to look it up).  If the USG turned every Supercomputer it owned to the task, it wouldn't be enough - specialized hardware would be required, and that takes time.  Building up 51% would NOT be a trivial undertaking, and it would not happen overnight - it's almost certain that the network could see it coming, and could adjust accordingly.  It's also worth noting that, apart from the cost of launching the attack, it would cost thousands, if not millions, per day to keep it going.  That means that only VERY well-financed attackers could keep it up.
Apart from hardware, there are ways to program the network to mitigate the effect of a 51% attacker - [Andressen]( went over some here.
Lastly, there's a limit to what a 51% attacker could do.  They could NOT take bitcoins out of a third-parties wallet.  They could not force spends on wallets they do not have access to.  They could grind bitcoin to a halt and double-spend their own coins, but in slowing the network, they would destroy the value of their own holdings.
Basically, a 51% attack gets more difficult as time/technology marches on, and eventually, it will become impractical for a malicious party to launch a profitable attack (we may already be past that point) - but we'll still need to guard against a Joker attack (aka, someone who just wants to watch Bitcoin burn).
@_date: 2013-04-08 21:58:19
They're looking for a "nonce" - it's a number tacked onto the transaction data set that, when the whole block is hashed, produces a hash with a certain number of 0's at the front (leading 0's).  The more zeros there are, the more difficult it is to find the nonce - that's how difficulty is adjusted - the more quickly that blocks are found, the higher the difficulty goes.  Once the nonce is found, the miner (or mining pool) is awarded the block reward, and the process starts over.
Edit: About confirmations/validation - once a block is announced, miners have an incentive to validate the block so they can begin building on top of it, and that way they don't waste work on the old block.  Validation is very fast, as it takes only a few hashes to verify the block once the corresponding nonce has been found.

I haven't really gotten my head around ripple yet - as far as I can tell, it's based on trading debt.  That's fine, but debt involves lending and risk, and in general, *that* requires backing - someone needs to lend and take the risk.  On top of that, risk has different values depending on the backer.  Something like Bitcoin backed Ripple could definitely allow for some functionality that isn't trivial to provide under Bitcoin's blockchain restrictions.  But I don't see that under current implementations.  Maybe I'm still missing something.

Believe it or not, articles like this are good for Bitcoin - there IS a limit to how fast we can grow before imploding.  
Look at MtGox - for chrissake, they're a bunch of "Magic the Gathering" nerds that somehow transitioned from online card trading into an virtual currency exchange - they're having scaling problems?  Who could have predicted that?  It strains belief that they even managed to establish themselves legally above-the-board in such a short time - and they *ARE* improving... and while they're our most important link to the rest of the financial world right now, they're *NOT* our only one.  Bitfloor has some actual trading experience, and they're actually a bit better at the moment, but they're not as big yet. Tradehill has yet to build up a considerable userbase, but they will add to the ecosystem...  And we need them - *ALL* of them.
Bitcoin is on fire right now, and every fire needs a damper.  If the FT was gung-ho on Bitcoin, we'd be in bigger trouble than if they called for us to be shut down.  Bitcoin can't handle that much influx yet - we're growing too fast, and temporary bubbles are inevitable.  Let the naysayers see crashes where they want to, and they'll be right in the short term.  We *can't* be concerned with that.  
We need individual vendors to learn about bitcoin.  We need small banks and young investors to look into the fundamentals. We need to be too big to stop when the government eventually tries something nefarious.  We *need* the big guys to laugh at us for as long as we can keep them laughing.

That's an interesting question - AFAIK, there hasn't been much study into this particular area; if my understanding is correct, most cryptanalysis has been around establishing that SHA256 hashes are effectively random, which makes collision analysis pretty much pointless.  I don't know that anyone has approached this from the opposite direction, and asked whether or not there is a class of values which CANNOT be produced by SHA256, thus effectively reducing the search space.
If anyone has any references/studies done on this, I'd be interested in seeing them.

Or, to be more evil, build in demurrage like Freicoin.  Simply tie the depreciation amount to the time since the last spend, and the old coins disappear into the air.  Because this is a government controlled (read: non decentralized) currency, miners are not strictly required because all verification could be done by a central authority more efficiently - so the central issuing authority 'collects' by simply issuing more coins.  Variations on centralization are possible (aka, having several "competing" authorized issuers/miners).
Voila - taxes without taxing!  The unattainable wet dream philosopher's stone of every progressive lefty! 
Which is why I don't think Freicoin will go anywhere on it's own.

It depends - that's part of the trade-off I was talking about.  If it's a sufficiently tiny key size, then it might be quicker to just recalculate everything.  But if it's a chained-block-cipher 4GB long, then it's probably not feasible to do so.
 Just back of the envelope calcs (ignoring poisson distribution/variance): if you have a 60GH/s machine, and you're looking for a needle in a 4GB haystack, then you'll need to do an average of 2GH for every lookup - that means you can do 30 lookups per second if you have an ASIC comparable to what is being used for Bitcoin.  That's not even *glacial* compared with what normal memory access speeds can do - that's probably 8 orders of magnitude slower.
Edit: disclaimer - I'm a software guy, so the lowest I go is firmware and assembly languages - if a hardware guy wants to jump in here and correct me on anything, I'm all ears - but I don't think I'm substantially off.

Bitfloor's service works better at the moment - the time from deposit to trading can be a few minutes -  as opposed to MtGox, where the queue to sign up is somewhere around 10k people, and days to verify.

This is open source development... it's somewhat misleading when you make governmental (aka, executive/legislative) comparisons.  
The most common (and maybe the most accurate) phrasing is that Gavin is the "benevolent dictator" - similar to the position Linus Torvalds holds with Linux.  
Gavin decides what Gavin wants to put in his code base - and because he is a very talented and very influential developer, his decisions hold a great deal of weight with the Bitcoin community.  However, all of his influence comes from the number of developers/users that are willing to use his codebase.  If he makes decisions that Bitcoin users at large disagree with, then he loses his user base, and thus his influence.
Bitcoin itself is *not* a codebase - it's a protocol which codebases must comply with in order to interoperate.  It's perfectly possible (but obviously difficult) to make a separate and completely independent codebase which runs off of the same blockchain, and interacts seamlessly with the "reference" code.
In the end, changes to Bitcoin will be adopted/rejected by 51% the miners, who are the ones doing the transaction validations.  Majority rules, for better or worse.

@_date: 2013-03-27 19:18:44
Your epiphany is a bit short sighted.
ASIC mining may make GPU mining unprofitable, but that won't make ASIC miners shut down - but GPU miners shutting down will make ASICs accelerate.  This is an arms race - anyone mining with a GPU can shift to ASIC and make roughly the same amount of Btc for the money.  The equipment gets better but cheaper, the difficulty shifts - the block reward remains.  It all balances.
You see a difficulty of 150M? Think more along the lines of 10x that - 100x probably within a decade.  That's the level required to protect the network from a concerted govt. attack.  That's why ASICs are necessary.
It makes absolutely NO sense to ban ASICs from the network, even if it was feasible (how do you distinguish an ASIC from pooled rigs of GPUs?) - just as it would have made no sense to ban GPUs when CPU hashing was all that was functional.
Bottom line, early adopters of ASICs are going to be well-rewarded for their risk-taking, as jgarzik and ASICMiner are.  The earlier you adopt, the better, but just like GPU mining, others will catch on and the playing field will level.  There will be some centralization, but competition among the pools for rewards/management will matter far more than the type of equipment that they're run on.
Will they be banned?  Do they need to be banned? Why should they be banned?
Zero likelihood.  Zero necessity. Zero reason.

I don't know of anything that really precludes governments from investing in/utilizing bitcoin, but there are a couple of factors that indicate that they will not. First, bitcoin is decentralized.  Governments HATE decentralization.  It doesn't matter what individual or which party is in power, bureaucracy abhors decentralization.  
I'm going to go with a parallel example in the internet - while it's mostly (some would say completely) decentralized, much of the critical infrastructure falls under ICANN, which is heavily influenced by the US government (and it's been relatively hands-off, thankfully).  Predictably, the past few years have seen proposals floated by repressive governments (China, Saudi Arabia, etc...) to put the internet under UN governance, with the obvious but not always explicitly stated intention of enabling much more powerful censorship.  
The internet has exploded to it's current scale because the US incubated it, and because the government did not act to restrict it.  That is an extraordinarily rare thing for a government to do - with the possible exception of Britain, I'm not sure that there's another government on the planet that would have allowed the Internet to grow in the same way (maybe Australia).  But I think it's worth noting here that the US government did NOT create the internet with the intention of providing a platform for free speech to decentralize informational access - they did it to give it the best chance to survive a nuclear war.  Even though the US has a strong culture of free speech/open information, the internet was a side-effect of other concerns.  There's no reason to thank the government for it, because they didn't fully realize what they were doing when they created it.  Even if it was just an unexpected benefit from the US culture of protected free speech, it simply never occurred to them to design in censorship (and I somewhat doubt that the researchers who did the actual work would have even complied).  By contrast, other governments of the world recognized the power and danger posed by the internet, and places like Cuba and North Korea (where information is highly regulated) banned it outright for years.
The internet has enabled the decentralization of information, and in many ways, information is power.  Bitcoin, by contrast, is not the decentralization of information, but the decentralization of money.  While all intelligent people understand or at least recognize the value of information, *ALL* people recognize the value and power of money (even those who call for it's abolition). 
And that's why Bitcoin is dangerous.
Bitcoin is dangerous the same way the internet is dangerous.  Bitcoin in itself is NOT intended to be an *attack* on governments, but it is intended to prevent the kind of monetary manipulation that many governments use as a shadow tax.  You can kidnap a country's citizens, attack embassies, malign rulers, break treaties, and violate sovereignty in any of a hundred ways and get nothing but sabre-rattling and annoyed empty speeches, but if you mess with tax revenues, you will get an immediate reaction.
I am NOT saying that Bitcoin is a panacea or a cure for all government corruption.  I am saying that it will force the corrupt to find new ways to extort, tax, and coerce money from those they seek to rule.  It will change things.  But just like China didn't magically turn away from censorship when they opened the internet, Bitcoin won't magically purge the financial system of corruption, or stop governments from seeking bribes. 
So why the concern with the US? Well, many redditors are US citizens, so there's a parochial bias there, but also because the US is the main government that could pose a true threat to Bitcoin.  I'm quite sure that the USG (or pretty much any national government) could shut down Bitcoin thru cyberattacks or other methods (at least for the next few years).   10 years from now, maybe Bitcoin will be beyond the power of the USG to shut down.  But if Obama came out in the SOTU tonite, and encouraged people to look into bitcoins, then as of tomorrow, no other government in the world would be able to stop it's growth.
But that's not going to happen, because the USG's expenditures over the next two decades will likely require massive monetary manipulation to keep the balance sheets from becoming completely red, and there is a constant chorus inside the Beltway for more and more financial regulation (toothless or not - they just want more rules written) and defacto centralization.  
Many in the US believe that the government is incapable of meeting it's financial obligations over the next few decades, so it will need to inflate the dollar to a fraction of it's current value - and it needs control over the monetary system to do that.  If a significant or even just noticeable portion of the US population begins using bitcoin instead of the dollar, then the government will almost certainly take steps to regulate bitcoin.  When regulation fails, they will attempt to shut it down by prosecuting exchanges.  The US government has a disturbingly long reach, and the crackdown thru the Swiss banking system is just a recent example. 
Bottom line, very few Bitcoiners believe that we will have the support of the USG in the short or medium term, and it's more likely that Bitcoin will face a systematic prosecution.  With the internet, we got lucky - the USG was behind it the whole way, and still helps to protect it (mostly) from coercive control.  With Bitcoin, we're extremely unlikely to have that same help - we'll be lucky if they just continue to ignore us.

Those can be reversed (for up to 30 to 90 days depending on the type)- the reversibility is where Bitcoin wins.  Traditional debit/credit/cash transactions still win in terms of instant gratification, and that's not likely to change regardless of Bitcoin's market penetration.

Excellent points overall (small quibbles with the 100 year light bulb thing - I know it's true, but it's an outlier), but I think that the overall arch of your argument is something that could be a huge selling point for bitcoin in the coming months/years.  
This is something that needs to be fleshed-out and distributed widely.

That's one of my worries too - I don't think that many US citizens appreciate just how much the US gets away with in terms of Monetary abuse - so if the dollar begins to lose it's perch atop the currency hill, then we'll start to see some genuine panic at the Fed, and panic at the Fed usually leads to really bad decisions at the Hill.  Granted, I'm not a professional economist, so a great deal of my current understanding is based on what could very well be wild and unfounded speculation (the mental kind, not the stock market kind) on my part, but the fact that we've experienced very low inflation despite massive monetary infusion could be explained in a not insignificant part by the dollar's place as the world's standard exchange unit.  
Once the dollar loses it's supremacy (or, as I noted above, if the dollar's place is even vaguely threatened), then all of a sudden, the methods that our Central Bankers have come to rely upon will suddenly be useless, and God alone knows what happens next.  Maybe they attempt to deflate the dollar to 'strengthen' the currency because deflation will be in style at the time - maybe they'll go full Weimar and run the printing presses full tilt - or, (most likely, I think) they'll run hat-in-hand to the White House and Congress to shut down this troublesome currency that's making them look bad.

This is probably the best advice, actually.
If she ever asks, just tell her that you sell meth.
Or more seriously, start thinking about a number - the number being what you believe you need to retire safely and comfortably on.  Is it 500k?  2M?  And why that number?  Exactly what is that number good for? Is it just a house somewhere that you own and pay minimal taxes on?  Is it early retirement?  Is it freedom to travel?  
Talk to your wife about the future, and find out what she wants too.  Maybe she's always wanted to run a small business (coffee shop or something) somewhere downtown, but can't afford startup costs.  Maybe she'd like to quit and be a homemaker.  If you know what she wants, then maybe, someday in the near future, you can take her out to a nice meal, and while you're talking, you can give her a great surprise.
You've been smart enough to invest in BTC, but it's still to early for you to treat it as "safe money".  But exchanging into USD means exchanging an appreciating currency for a depreciating one, so there's risk in that too.  What risk do you find acceptable?  The risk in BTC?  Or the risk in USD?
Value is different from person to person - that's what makes economy possible.  It's what makes one person exchange a lump of yellow rock for a barrel of apples.  The important thing is to know what you want out of it.  Your goal isn't measured in USD, and isn't measured in Bitcoin.  They're just tools to get you to your goal, not the goal in of themselves.
So, to quote Buddy Ackerman: "...ask yourself: what do you really want?"

Coinbase's actions have always seemed to me to be indicative of an over-abundance of caution rather than malicious.   As far as 80-90% accuracy goes, again, they've shown that they'd rather reject legitimate transactions than accept any fraudulent ones.  
Bitcoin's user-base is almost universally computer-savvy, and we've all gotten used to the instant on-demand services or next-day delivery from Amazon, or instant transfers between bank accounts... and dealing with a new service like Coinbase that needs to navigate the labyrinthian regulations surrounding ACH transfers can be maddening because it's so slow... 
I have a friend who works in banking IT, so I had him as a resource when I was first studying bitcoin - it was a huge help for me to become at least a bit familiar with the maddeningly complex internal workings of banks.  Nothing Coinbase has done strikes me as anything other than overdone due diligence - it's not the best customer service on their part, but they are acting in ways which protect themselves and their investors from fraud and/or legal prosecution.  Maddening, yes.  Fraudulent, no.

Exactly - you can't prevent someone from spending it in person the spending it on the blockchain immediately after if they've got the private key.
After thinking about this for a bit, I'm pretty sure the only way this would work would be to have a hash identifier that allows someone to verify that the coin exists, but does not include the private key - so that means that you need an issuing authority with a reasonable amount of trustworthiness to hold the PK and redeem it on demand.
So... yes, it's possible, but you still have the problem where this note is far more forgeable than an actual bitcoin.  So, it's basically on par with a gold certificate.
Edit: on par with a *verifiable* gold certificate.  So it's got that going for it.
@_date: 2013-01-30 20:25:13
Banks could not prevent people from transferring bitcoins - what they CAN do is make it difficult (but definitely not impossible) for people to exchange their bitcoins for other currency.  The USG simply saying "I own account# ABCD1235...." does not prevent the person who actually controls the private key to that account from transferring bitcoins out to a different wallet.
The cryptographic basis of bitcoin prevents exactly the type of coercion or appropriation you're describing.  A 51% attack could prevent transactions from being verified in a reasonable time, but no amount of computational power attainable on Earth can 'claim' someone else's bitcoins without their cooperation.

Nobody gets promoted by telling a Senator what can't be done, or what they don't have the power to do.  Bureaucrats will always claim that they're on top of things, and will always say they could use more funding.  The Secret Service guy said pretty much that on his first or second speech.
Nobody is going to get up and testify to impotence or incompetence.  
That's why bureaucracies fail.
Edit: I don't think they're scared.  None of them demonstrated the necessary foresight to be scared.  They sounded like run-of-the-mill bureaucrats to me.  Nothing but good news to report, but endless threats on the horizon demanding funding to address.

Your quick analysis seems more or less reasonable to me - I think that expected appreciation of bitcoin is factored into the price by many bidders.

That's true regardless of investment - an investor can almost *always* pull out early thru one method or another, whether it's simply cashing out, or by selling their stake in the investment.
Basically, you're saying that this idea is targeted at people who don't feel they have enough discipline and don't believe they can be trusted with their own money, so they have to give it to someone else to take care of it for them.  That's just describing a bank, or hedge fund, or any other investment firm.
In all fairness, that is a concept that's made a *lot* of money in the past, but it's also the root of many of the biggest financial problems today (problems which, if I'm not mistaken, Bitcoin is not fundamentally immune from).  Large scale investment is usually opaque investment, and people have shown they have extreme trouble distinguishing Warren Buffet from Bernie Madoff, or, to be more parochial, Coinbase from pirateat40.
I'm not saying it can't work - it could, in fact, be wildly successful.  But any success for an individual investor above and beyond what they would get thru simply holding the Bitcoins themselves is dependent on how the Trust's investments *outside* of Bitcoin perform.  And at that point, you're looking at standard financial/wealth services, and Bitcoin would only be one aspect of the Trust's holdings.

Thou shalt not make a machine in the image of a mind.
Edit: it occurs to me that Spice allows navigators to solve "space folding" problems which are intractable to computers.  Spice, therefore, allows a human mind to perform as a hyper-Turing machine.  It's therefore highly likely that a Spice-infused mentat (or at least the Kwisatz Haderach) could break Private/Public key encryption.
Edit2: I've thought about this a bit further:
 * Guild Navigators can perform hyper-turing computations, but they're specialized and limited.  So they can quickly solve NP-style problems in a specific domain (space folding), but cannot solve the generalized NP version of the problem.  They can probably mine Bitcoin more efficiently than standard computers, but not on the scale that would allow them to break it if it's on a sufficient bit-space (probably bigger than 256).
 * Mentats are basically human computers, but they have computational power and storage far beyond what computers had; this means they can probably perform both hashing and encryption, but cannot break it.  Basically, the mentats would be the Bitcoin nodes - they can validate and store, but can't mine as efficiently as navigators.
 *   The Kwisatz Haderach (aka, the shortening-of-the-way), can optimally solve the generalized NP versions of hashing and encryption schemes.  The Kwisatz Haderach could therefore efficiently break both elliptic curve signing encryption, and all hashing schemes.  There may be some quantum-resistant hash functions, but there is no Kwisatz Haderach resistant hash.  He could destroy Bitcoin; and he who can destroy something controls it.
