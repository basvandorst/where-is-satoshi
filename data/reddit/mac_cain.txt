"So everything hinges on whether bitcoin will be criminalized like alcohol in the 20s, drugs in the 70s, privacy in the 00s.” Great quote.

Obvious when you point it out.
I've set up and used wiki's before but they have been for a closed group. Didn't occur to me that it would be an open wiki but when you think about it the clue's in the name "Open Street Map"

Go here  and search for bitcoin to get the trademark application.

I do believe the cops said it was to buy drags. Should have rung BIG alarm bells. 
Was the case about facilitating drug trafficing and the bitcoin thing was a technicality?

Money creation. What most of us already know and most others can't believe.
The collapse is only a matter of time. What continues to surprises me is how it hasn't happened already.

Even though $0.10 is not a lot of money if feels strange paying for video content.
Maybe if you pay $0.15 and the first video gets $0.05 the next gets $0.04 the next $0.03 the last gets $0.02 and the site gets $0.01 ( or some other variation) would/might spread the love a little better. And save having to re-spend for each video? The sign-up option might have this kind of option or a credit on your account? But I didn't look.

Here in England we have lots of currencies. The best known is in London and it's the Brixton Pound (Brixton is an area of London and has it's own Council and Mayor.  ). The Brixton Pound does not cross the border to other Councils like Westminster Council as it's not recognised by, for example, Westminster shops. Does California have anything similar and does this "guidance" affect any other "alternative" currencies if they exist.

A friends son was stranded in Melbourne and needed £800 to get to Sydney to fly out. Sending two lots of £400, the maximum you can send without going through KYC and AML, at a charge of £20 each over two days failed because the Western Union system was down for maintenance and they close for the weekend. Worldwide!
Within an hour of contacting me their son had £800 in his hand at a cost of 8p in miners fees. They gave me the £40 that Western Union didn't get :-)

Like to see it updated. The price crashing, intellectual  property pouring in,  some updated/changed perspectives from big fiat players.

I'm running the Lazooz app. This will work in the future but if it's the Lazooz version I don't know. But it does no harm running it. Even if you're on public transport. Lazooz or similar might show up that a group hiring a minibus is better than a journey using multiple transport systems like two bus and a couple of trains to get to/from work.

Have the same problem. I sent a payment that I had signed with an air gaped Armory. The blockchain shows the payment was sent but Armory never gets a conformation.

I had full backups of Armory and Bitcore and even then could not recover/restore and fix it. 
I ended up dumping the lot, Armory and Bitcore, and staring again.
I have been running bitcoind since mid 2011

Fascinating in-sight. Well worth the the hour.
Tim has bitcoin as a wet dream for crypto-anarchists who don't like the nation state but the majority need/want to have state approval so bitcoin (small b) fails. He believes that someone will pull off digital cash soon but it will take 10 to 50 years.
If he's right, it's depressing. But I think that his conclusions may well be outflanked as all his terms of reference where within the singular nation state. And bitcoin, like an idea who's time has come, knows no borders.
