Imagine if Jamie Dimon was made to do this ��

Neo at $225 by year end is conservative.

Why aren't they priced at the cost in bitcoin at the point of release? Can someone fix this? 
@_date: 2018-09-30 11:29:31
I think I saw the ico for that in 2017.

Gotta love KAL

To be fair, I was comparing numbers. 
@_date: 2018-08-15 20:14:33
I'm with stupid.

The 2 are incomparable.

Ah, I haven't seen this meme for a while. Welcome back old friend. 
@_date: 2018-05-05 20:25:08
-30%. Is that the 2018 return? 
@_date: 2018-08-02 20:49:23
Love it. Although I doubt that thing could make it 3000 metres let alone 3000 miles. 
@_date: 2018-05-05 20:52:15
This is basically the same as me saying "in a few months I think I can be a better footballer than Ronaldo". Bitcoin Cash is basically the crypto equivalent of Nicklas Bendtner.

No need to worry about capital gains in this market ����

I'm guessing from your illiteracy that you're from China? /s
@_date: 2018-10-13 13:45:09
Nice. Is that the eoy price of bitcoin???

I used to go out with a girl when I was 11, but I dumped her after 2 weeks.  When she grew up she became a big time actress. I could've been Mr rich actress. Hey ho
@_date: 2018-06-24 20:59:25
Shazza!!!!

Are you really the head of the Kwik-E-Mart?

Now, my story begins in 19-dickety-two. We had to say "dickety" cause that Kaiser had stolen our word "twenty". I chased that rascal to get it back, but gave up after dickety-six miles.

I needed a new heel for my shoe, so, I decided to go to Morganville, which is what they called Shelbyville in those days. So I tied an onion to my belt, which was the style at the time. Now, to take the ferry cost a nickel, and in those days, nickels had pictures of bumblebees on 'em. Give me five bees for a quarter,you'd say.
Now where were we? Oh yeah: the important thing was I had an onion on my belt, which was the style at the time. They didn't have white onions because of the war. The only thing you could get was those big yellow ones...

Buy high, sell low.
Has worked great for me so far as I'm now a millionaire!
I did use to be a billionaire mind... 
@_date: 2019-04-08 19:27:29
Sounds like a cuge hunt.
@_date: 2018-11-26 21:42:20
I think I need toilet roll... 
@_date: 2018-11-05 18:10:44
$6.4k for 2018? It's down as $6.4k forever.... 
@_date: 2019-01-04 19:18:13
Just remember, 6 cents to 30 cents is the same as $4k to $20k.  Hands up if you'd sell if bitcoin was at $20k??
@_date: 2018-03-31 08:08:54
I think i must've dropped mine in the shower. That would at least explain why I'm getting shafted so hard in the arse at the moment. 
@_date: 2019-01-03 17:49:32
Great pog collection! 
@_date: 2018-02-20 20:21:07
That's an oxymoron
@_date: 2018-02-27 05:43:03
Some shelves
@_date: 2019-01-05 15:44:06
But who honestly has the balls to hold to 100k? In my experience it's harder hodl on the way up than the way down. 
@_date: 2019-01-05 03:35:26
This.

I read this as Ru Paul...

Bitcoins's death has been greatly over exaggerated. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 19:58:28
That's basically like having a mortgage at the same level as your annual salary. Wish my mortgage was that low!

Never try and catch a falling knife.

New Belgium!? Sweet.

Fud light. Just 1 calorie, not fuddy enough. 
@_date: 2018-04-07 19:18:35
Works surprisingly well in reverse too to show how quickly a fad is over. 
@_date: 2019-05-12 20:10:47
Sell. Exit. Then, in many years, tell your grandkids about the time how you made a killing trading bitcoin ��
