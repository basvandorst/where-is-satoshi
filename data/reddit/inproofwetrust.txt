Great skit. He nails it. There's a r/bitcoin post today from someone who does a bitcoin radio show. He was asked to do an informational interview segment by a local television show. The reporters first question was something like...what is bitcoin? The guys first answer was something like...it's a way to decentralize domain name registration. I couldn't believe it. When is the madness going to end?

Looks like you customer demographic would most likely use SpiritCoin, I'd check into that.

I think your response to his first question was terrible. This is one of the main adoption problems. Decentralized domain registration application? The general public doesn't care or understand about things like this. And change the channel, or leave the room quick.  When you have the opportunity of a mass platform you've really got to choose the broadest and most easily understood applications. Easy analogies, like email to snail mail for example as an entry point. You are fighting the good fight, I commend you. But please try not to squander these precious opportunities.

Are there any plans for an awareness/branding campaign outside of the geek/gamer community? If not I propose we use a bounty to create one. A Major adoption friction point is the " technical " nature of the technology. I cringe every time I see someone use the word cryptography as an entry point to the explanation of Bitcoin to Joe Public. Is it just me or does Joe look like he's petrified? We need a focus point that is easily comprehensible and at the same time transcendent. I don't think any current attempts have yet achieved this lofty goal.  I just think we can do better.

If I'm not mistaken there is a secret 
kabbalah ritual that uncovered the code. If you chant the code you will become well endowed with SpiritCoin.

I think I saw one of those in a museum once. The display indicated a lot of conservative old people use them. I wonder if that's the best place to spend currency on an awareness campaign?

Hey baby, wanna semantic?

Programmable ? Baseball programs are used for money on the internet? Oh I get it, like baseball cards, no bank involved.

I know what local means, but what's a newspapers?

Only one kid is suffering, the one that got screwed by the current system. Looks like Bitcoin kid is pretty damn happy.

I applaud your effort however the newspaper logic in my eyes is a bit naive. Best of luck!!!!!!!!!!

It's not a cheap point. It alleviates gross inefficiencies in the fiat economy. It has the potential to have a transformative  effect in developing nations. One of the many positive consequences will be that more currency gets to intended destination, be that a cleft palette, or drinking well. This is indeed a very **serious point**.
