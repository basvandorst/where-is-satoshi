I feel like that's a big thing that will hold bitcoin back. You have to have computers and phones to use bitcoin. What about people in third world countries? Will they just never be able have money? It just doesn't make sense.

I have so much to learn. This is all extremely confusing. Do I have just one account? Or does each website/app have their own account? How do I transfer my coins to other accounts? I feel like I gotta take a college course just to learn how to use a new currency.

Well where do I buy bitcoin from then? Everywhere I see says "coinbase coinbase coinbase". Why is everyone on here recommending them?

Ok I'll stay away from coinbase

Where would I store my bought bitcoins? If I buy from different places are they all gonna be in different accounts? I'd like to have it all on one app on my phone. I don't own a computer.

I've watched lots of videos and they seem to confuse me even more than initially

It's not and you need to learn how to read.

I was thinking of another website I had visited before. And I sorta trailed off on the entire bitcoin in general.

I got that app just now but it won't let me set up my card and I can't do PayPal

Thanks but I went there and it's confusing. I have no idea what I'm doing. Currency isn't supposed to be confusing. I believe this is the one fault with bitcoin. It should be simple so people actually use it. This devalues it greatly.

Ok and? I said I want $20 of bitcoin not for you to tell me the value of it.
