The problem your are solving is:
Find a number that is:
1) equal to the hash of bitcoin transactions.
2) less than a network set constant.
Bitcoins are real money.  They can be used within a day of creation.

My example is how I did it not the correct way.  My transaction never showed up on the network.  I don't know why but all I needed to do was get my client to not know about it.
Why do you say it takes 2 weeks to clear.  The network has no knowledge of the transaction.  The transaction ID is:2241fe663161cc51aa19e1c2a03049b9cd5f96cad9b88d062d07ef95ac3f60d9.  That never showed up.   It looks clear to me.  All my coins are spendable.
I kept a copy of the wallet.dat file with the rejected transaction in it.

Is that true?  This was a Ledger nano.

This wallet was a gift.  The owner does not have the secret words.  I have a copy of the words and I know my copy was not compromised.  A possibility is that I gave the owner a copy of the secret words (on paper, I would never make an electronic copy) and his copy was stolen.  He claims he never got a copy of the secret words.

I bought it.  Gave it to a relative.  I set it up with the Chrome Ledger app.

I bought it.  From Ledger.

I bought the Ledger.  It was one of the first Ledger nanos purchased years ago.

Brute force is impossible.  Spyware is not possible because the Ledger wasn't connected to a computer since early June, 10 days before the transaction.   Plus 4 private keys were needed for the transaction.  They never leave the Ledger.  The transaction is signed on the Ledger.

You are lying.

This is exactly why I never do extortion.  It is way too much trouble.  Plus, you can never trust your pets.
