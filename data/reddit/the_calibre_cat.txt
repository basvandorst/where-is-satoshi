I agree with you.  Frankly, I think it'd make much more sense to try and build some kind of system of distributed space, to where every user uses a few GB of space to donate to the network (ideally configurable in settings) that would be used to securely store the blockchain.  Make the default, like, 4GB - not unreasonable, but enough that spread across 100,000 computers you'll have enough space for the blockchain.
Otherwise, your post is good... and I'm amused by the fact that your second paragraph is practically the argument of @_date: 2018-01-29 10:35:34

I'm looking at starting a payment channel for Bitcoin for businesses in my area, and promoting that.  Anyone got any resources that'd make me able to do that?
@_date: 2018-01-08 00:41:02
I'm not a Bitcoin Cash fan - they have a right to their technical differences but, quite frankly, I have a *really* hard time trusting a.) the kingpin of the current mining monopoly and b.) Roger Ver, who's paid people to issue favorable reviews of his currency and negative opinions about his competitors.  They seem really, really scummy, and I trust that scummy people tend to stick around scummy people.  I truly just do not trust the leading people behind Bitcoin Cash as far as I could throw a stone.
If Bitcoin is to survive and not hemorrhage the value it's built up, then, in my view, two things need to happen:
1. There must be a reasonable blocksize increase immediately.  Honoring the New York Agreement (2MB hard limit, community agreements up to 4MB) would be the best way to do this.  Hell, it'd probably cause a pretty significant devaluation in Bitcoin Cash, as people return to Bitcoin, although that's not the goal.  This would give Bitcoin the liquidity it needs until Lightning is developed, without delving into the insanity of 1+GB blocks that the crazy people behind Bitcoin Cash are unironically talking about.
2. Lightning Network must not only be completed and functional on the blockchain within 2018, it must *also* have an easy-to-use U.I. **within Bitcoin Core**.  A user should be able to fire up Core, click "Create Lightning payment channel" (or something), and instantly make a payment channel with a willing participant, across which Bitcoin can be sent and received.
Without these, the Bitcoin experiment ends.  Sidechains aren't bad, in fact, they're arguably the best way to preserve decentralization, but we cannot spend 2018 losing what we have worked so hard to build.  Bitcoin is Bitcoin.  First mover advantage is ours, and I've been persuaded by some arguments that at least *SOME* kind of a blocksize increase isn't the death knell to decentralization that it's been made out to be.
Let's save Bitcoin.  Let's put some pressure on core to do this.
@_date: 2018-01-08 00:44:21


Which is not what Bitcoin was ever intended to be.  In fact, I distinctly remember this subreddit championing *against* this definition of Bitcoin in 2013-2017 when it *worked* as a payment system, as all the naysaying talking heads were calling it just a high risk investment.
It can't very well be a good store of value, if there's no way to put value into it - and it's tough to do that with fees as high as they are.  Something has to be done about that.
@_date: 2018-01-08 01:03:24
I'm saying that your objection to the swinging *value* of Bitcoin being it's problem is like, nonsensical.  Objecting to that might as well be objecting to crypto generally, since *we don't know what its value is or will be*.  Could be $5,000 per BTC, could be $240,000 per BTC - I don't know!  I *DO* know, however, that your assumption that it's not a good store of value because it "changes" value, effectively renders anything *but* the dollar to be a "good" store of value - since any new store of value would have to start near $0 and climb its way to its honest market value, which, you know, is a pretty significant change in value and that's not predictable at all!
I'm not saying that transaction fees and transaction times aren't a problem, they absolutely are - but that's a problem that can be directly addressed by software.  Complaining about swings of 20% value in a day, on the other hand, is tantamount to complaining about the volatility of stocks, which can do the same thing.  It's part of the damn game, at least, *certainly* at this point, where crypto adoption and use isn't nearly as widespread as the dollar.
Assuming it gets there (I'm quite confident it will), it *will* become stable, but the solution to that is a social process, not a software patch.  We can solve transaction fees/time with software, and hopefully Bitcoin will be the coin that people adopt.  If we don't solve those problems with software, a different coin will be adopted.
@_date: 2018-01-08 21:15:21
Why?  I mean, seriously, the full node thing is a great thing to advocate, but it's just... beyond the realm of practicality, in my view.  You're never going to get a full node to run on a smartphone, especially as the resources needed to run a full node increase every day.  If people can't issue payments from their smartphone, it's not a payment system.
And, to equate S.P.V. wallets with "U.S.D. or PayPal" is a little extreme, man.  I'm trusting banks with those funds.  I don't have to trust banks with S.P.V. wallets, just the node provider, which I could change - and that node provider would STILL find it absurdly costly to fuck with the transactions in the blockchain, because each block contains a hash of the previous block.
@_date: 2018-01-08 22:11:11
I actually do run a full node, and can *kind of* see his point here, even if I think he's being... frankly, extremist about it.  Still, there are solutions here that are available that Core hasn't availed themselves of.  For example, in my reply to I noted that it's basically out of the realm of reasonable practicality for a smartphone to be a full node.
But it's not out of the realm of reasonable practicality for my desktop to be, at least for now - and... why couldn't I point my smartphone to my desktop (or other full node provider) to have it verify block hashes, so that I can still have 55GB of music on my phone, and otherwise secure Bitcoin transactions?
There's usability improvements here, and I'm worried that, frankly, we've got open-source extremism that's letting perfect be the enemy of good.  It's kind of silly to be worried about everyone not running full nodes (full stop:  if this expectation is forced upon users, Bitcoin is doomed for the same reason people use Windows instead of Linux) and then be okay with centralized payment channels.

When you're starting from effectively "no value," though, I am going to disagree with that.  The market hasn't yet found the value of this thing, and as yet hasn't encountered a commodity like it.  As a result of that, I don't think 20% swings in value are all that surprising.  They're not great, but until the market comes to a greater consensus on what this shit is worth, they will happen from time to time - and the market will *not* come to a greater consensus on what it's worth, until we have greater society-wide adoption.  We won't have greater society-wide adoption without low transaction fees and times.


I understand the distinction between those two.  However, if you create a new store of value, you have to convince people that it's a good store of value *before* it's going to have any value.  That's what Bitcoin is doing.  I'm convinced Bitcoin's value lies between $100,000 and $1,000,000, and so, it will have some days where it climbs 20% to get there.  It *has* to in order to get there.  It's *going* to be unstable as long as it remains the niche of investors and hodlers, it won't stabilize until *everyone* is using it to transact.
@_date: 2018-01-08 05:37:35


I agree.  And in my opinion, "early to mid 2019" isn't remotely acceptable.  They've been championing  for years now, they can get it done before end of year 2018.
@_date: 2018-01-08 00:45:30
The fact that it can swing 20% in a day has absolutely nothing to do with its technical underpinnings.  We can't program away the human element of economics, if you're bitching about that, go back to dollars?
@_date: 2018-01-08 00:52:18
I didn't say the exchange element isn't important, I said "swings of 20% of its value in day" is not something that can be technically addressed by software.  Humans aren't valuing Bitcoin at $16,400 because that's hard-coded into the software, they're valuing it at that because that's what buyers are willing to pay for it, and that's what sellers aren't willing to go less than.
So, as I said, you can bitch about the swings of 20% in a day, but the only thing that's going to address that, is adoption.  And adoption will not increase, until the very real problem of costly exchanges, goes away.  THAT problem can be rectified through software.  The swings in value?  Will probably persist for awhile even AFTER Bitcoin's transaction cost problem is fixed.

This.  I can see the potential for lightning to become "centralized," but shit, my company builds a centralized solution for my clients.  It's just that with Bitcoin, the piece underneath is secured by distributed data and cryptography that gives zero fucks about the brand of suit you're wearing or how many houses you own.  Shit, even the piece *on top* (Lightning) is secured by honest crypto - no one can just run off with your shit, and rather than being forced into a single system of pre-established A.C.H.'s and payment processors, an Ubuntu server and a bit of bandwidth is all you need to play.
That's outstanding, and it will get Bitcoin to VISA and PayPal-like levels of scaling.

@_date: 2018-01-08 05:40:18
A blocksize increase to 4MB would not, in the remotest sense, spell the end of Bitcoin long-term.  Storage capacity is getting cheaper, and even at 1MB blocks, the blockchain is nearly 200GB in size.  If Bitcoin is in it to win it, it's going to be north of 1TB *eventually*.

If there was a new block every hour, then effectively you'd be cutting transaction rates by six.  It'd be effectively the same has having 1/6th GB blocks every 10 minutes, which would still grow the blockchain by an absurd amount each year - to the point where the only people who could host full nodes would be large, centralized data centers.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:45:55


That's not my experience, given that B.C.H. supporters are unironically talking about 1GB blocksizes, and have already blown the existing blocksize limit to up to 32MB.  Unsustainable for anyone that isn't a server or datacenter operator to run a full node.


Won't deny that, but it's at the risk of greater centralization in the future, and you won't be able to put that toothpaste back in the tube.
Which, you know, is fine, different technical philosophies and such.  Personally, I support a blocksize increase... to 2MB, just to accommodate transactions for the foreseeable future until Lightning gets deployed.

If a bank wanted to, right now, it could take funds from your account and send it away, knowing that you very likely couldn't produce evidence to the state that you *didn't* order them to send that transaction.  In a lightning channel, no one could do this.

That's why, even though I think there are some... questionable things about the Bitcoin Cash guys, I think ultimately it's easy to fall into the trap of ascribing malicious intent upon a competitor, when really there just *is* a difference of technical opinion.
I think they're playing a little fast and loose with blocksizes, but then, you know?  Maybe a hundred years from now, we'll be talking about the complaints of 8MB blocksizes like they were ridiculous.  And we'll be talking about blockchains *without* sidechain solutions as antiquated and not as useful.
So I can't join in on the hate train.  At the end of the day, they're people who hold crypto.  And they're dedicated to their ideal, and shit, *their* dedication has made me an extra $10,000.  I could cash out *one* B.C.H. and recoup my whole investment into cryptocurrency, and part of that is unambiguously because they *are* dedicated to making their currency good and making it work well.  I would even argue, they have a point, and the recent spate of social media encouraging people to get on the SegWit train (**raises hand meekly**) is a *very* healthy thing to see.
Blockchain currency is weird, man.  You have to campaign for your ideals, so even though "we activated SegWit" was in and of itself a major milestone, we STILL have to actually start USING that newly activated feature, we DO have to push for that.  It's interesting how blockchains almost impart a political property on currency, and that's the beauty of blockchains.

Gold wasn't a bubble, people were investing in it *right* as the financial system was teetering on the edge of collapse.  After a fairly short while, average folks sold off.  That isn't unlikely with Bitcoin, but I don't see it, because people aren't investing in Bitcoin because the economy is bad, because the economy *isn't* bad right now.  I think some people certainly want to cash in and see the value rise, which I think it will continue to until the transaction cost problem reaches a tipping point.  
The Bitcoin Core team *does* need to address this, and I do believe that their off-chain solution is the technically meritorious solution (vs. pumping up blocksizes to high heaven).
Housing doesn't apply - it couldn't have gone half as wild as it did without a.) government pumping money into the sector, and b.) banks lying about the quality of their securities, neither of which is taking place within Bitcoin.


Okay, but then we're talking about a different kind of speculative bubble here, we're not talking about tulipmania.  I will argue, that *gold and houses remain valuable*.  They may not be AS valuable as they were during the height of their bubble, but they retain *some* significant value.  Tulips don't.
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:36:19


It didn't.  People's perceptions of the economy's "recovery" did not align with those of the experts.  The recession officially "ended" in June 2009, but no working man or woman seriously believed that.  The public tends to be cynical of the testimony of experts, for better or for worse.


It can, though.  If that reason doesn't apply, then you can't really say, "Well look at this example as to why *$current_thing is a bubble!" if none of the reasons why your example is a bubble apply to *$current_thing*.


I agree.  But there's good reason to believe cryptocurrencies are sating a market demand, and that they will be pretty valuable in the end.


Agreed.  Your gold rationale is considerably more applicable, in my view.


Right, but *individual tulips* are like... $6.99.  That's a far cry from a $1,300 ounce of gold, or a $120,000 house.


I mean, this is all contingent on Bitcoin ceasing to be a currency... which, it *is* a currency, even now, with high transaction costs and long confirmation times.  That won't change unless a LOT of people started getting into it before the lightning network gets deployed, and it seems to me like the Core team is making pretty good progress on that.  As long as Bitcoin remains a currency, 


I don't agree with that at all - this forum talks about "hodling" instead of selling, BECAUSE it is expected to be a good store of value and worth a great deal in the future.  A *good* store of value *should* be valuable!  And Bitcoiners are *definitely* talking about all this - there's enormous chatter about the community as to ameliorating the transaction cost/confirmation time problem, because whether we like Bitcoin or not (and we *love* Bitcoin) this *is* a problem.


You're right, but I'm confident that it will - provided the transaction problem is solved.

Because it's the world's first *honest* currency system.  No organization can reach into your Bitcoin wallet and take the funds, and no organization can devalue the Bitcoin in that wallet to further their own ends.  Your money is *yours*, and we've literally never tried that before.
We do, however, have pretty damn good historical evidence to suggest that *the best money wins*.  No fiat currency in the history of the world has endured - over a long enough timeline, the value of all fiat currencies plunges to zero.  Gold and silver are counterexamples - they are still worth a not-insignificant amount of money, and that's *with* all manner of state tampering with that value.
It's no different than anything else on the market - people will ultimately select for the best.  Barring some growing pains, Bitcoin *is* the best.

Mainly because it provides a nice store of value, which is what it's being used for *today*.  It's easy to say that it's being used as a speculative instrument for investment, and while that's true to some degree, that's only because people are making the bet that it's going to be worth a lot in the future *as* that store of value.  The more people see it, the more people understand and the more people honestly *agree* with that statement.  Everybody understands that money is controlled by a cabal of elites.  Bitcoin frees them from that, and in my experience, *literally everyone* - from the banker to the bum, has an interest in using crypto to secure their financial livelihood.  Speculative investment or not, provided Bitcoin doesn't get broken (and I remain as-yet unconvinced that *even this* would kill Bitcoin), it *will* have future value that people can depend upon, *like* gold.  
I'm convinced that that future value lies somewhere between $100,000 per Bitcoin, to possibly $1,000,000 per Bitcoin, with me thinking that it'll probably settle nearer to the $200,000-$500,000 range.  That's MY speculation, and *hell yes* I got into Bitcoin once I understood that knowing that when I bought in at $330 I'd make a killing by getting in early... but that's like Apple stock or Google stock.  Those stocks weren't bubbles, they HAD real, actual value.  They didn't pop - they *continue* to have real, actual value.  Just because Bitcoin is worth ~$14,000 and Google is worth ~$1,000 is immaterial if Bitcoin's true value is at (or above) where it is presently.
So, I think that this will be a compliment to gold, but because it runs off of the online infrastructure, will be MUCH more compatible with the modern economy and everyone from people to organizations will be able to safeguard their wealth - to some degree - using Bitcoin.  Shit starts going down, economically?  Maybe start allocating a larger of a percentage into Bitcoin, because it's safe and it'll help you/your organization weather the economic storm, etc.

@_date: 2017-12-17 15:49:57
Right, but I'm saying that that mania and excessive demand would not persist for eight years.  The market is irrational in the short term, but very rational in the long term.  I remember in 2013, when the price of Bitcoin "surged" to $1,300 (lol) in a week.  I knew there was nothing there then, that was it's value getting blown up by some media stories, and people looking for a get rich quick vehicle.  Sure as shit, the price came crashing down - because the market was irrationally valuing that, rather than the fundamentals that Bitcoin offers that are valuable.
We've gotta get transaction costs under control, but i believe Core is on the right track with off-chain solutions - that Bitcoin Cash supporters unironically talk about gigabyte blocksizes to reach Visa transaction levels is just comedic.

Extremely positively, if I'm being perfectly honest.  Though, that said... they're also a bunch of shysters.  I know I should "know where I'm at" in my checking/savings accounts, and these days I'm much better at it, but that didn't stop them from tagging me with $35 overdraft fees at every opportunity they could get, *even when I had specifically told them* to shut off the damn card when I hit zero.
Unlike many here, I actually sympathize with banks - I fully believe that a lot of them are as scummy as they are because it is legitimately difficult to do business in such a heavily regulated sector.  We should empathize with them more, because failure to do so will only encourage the government to regulate Bitcoin and cryptocurrency ever more heavily, to the sounds of cheering applause.
Regulation seldom solves things.  Competition does.  I guarantee you, Bitcoin is a more powerful threat to dickish banking interests than the S.E.C, the F.T.C, the C.F.T.C, and the C.F.P.B. ever were or will be.

1. How did he do this?
2. Why is this bad?  I've thought about starting an altcoin that I think offers something that no existing coin does.  I would want to pump its value and adoption up.
Litecoin was a valid attempt to rectify some legitimate criticisms of Bitcoin, it's open source, it's decentralized, and people adopted it.  Sorry, I don't see any evil there that literally every coin that starts with an I.C.O. is guilty of.

You can't get those, journalists in established organizations with access to databases like LexisNexis and others can.  There is some information you cannot get.  This person literally just typed into the text form on Reddit, that takes a little bit of time and some imagination, that's it.  To suggest that we should not corroborate these claims, or demand corroborating sources from the person making them, is just silly to me.  I could do the same thing right now, and by your logic, you should take me seriously, because I *didn't* support my argument with second-party sources at all.
Sorry, but that makes just *no* sense to me, especially in a thing where real money is being traded.


It doesn't necessarily make it true, and nobody's claiming that.  But it's sure a lot harder to falsify information that other people have gone out and confirmed, independently, on their own.  If you just make a wall of text, there's literally nothing suggesting that you're being straight.  You can type anything in there.

They don't, only when they're making affirmative claims that they expect to have taken seriously.  This is optimistic about Bitcoin, which is something people put real money towards.  If anything warrants a source, that does.


You don't really need to do this, as your link should be going towards someone or some organization that has a positive reputation that they've cultivated over a long period of time.  If Forbes said there was $3 million worth being exchanged at Bitcoin ATMs, that would be notable.  If it was some unheard of crypto site saying it, I'd be a lot more skeptical.

1.) They're not talking about "slightly" larger blocks - they're talking about GB sized blocks unironically.
2.) They present themselves as the real Bitcoin, despite, at the time of the fork, most signaling from users siding with Bitcoin and about an even amount of signaling from miners one way or the other.

If your country utilizes price controls on medicine, pharmaceuticals, and biotechnology (and pretty much every country that has a tax-funded healthcare system does), then it is not paying the fair market price of those goods.  The company selling those goods can take one of two courses:
1. It can resign itself to lower (or, in most of these cases, almost non-existent) profits, which doesn't help the company weather uncertain negative future economic circumstances (like that flood in Thailand that fucked the factory that supplied motors for hard drives), expand, and/or put money into future products.
2. They can shift those lost profits to a market that they know *will* pay for them - such as a third-party insurer in a country that has them.  Which means America.
Consumers have no stake in this, because hey, it's not their money (past their deductible).  They don't shop around for a provider/reseller who provides them with good value, because they can't - they're trapped in their network, and they have no incentive to help the insurers shop around... so prices are ballooning out of control.  
That also ignores U.S. military subsidization of almost every country with public healthcare.  They pay a fraction of what their actual defense needs are, freeing some of their budget to be spent on social services.  We don't have that luxury, since we're paying the bulk of everyone's defense bill.
One of the pros of a universal healthcare system in the United States is that foreign governments would no longer enjoy the power disparity that they now enjoy when negotiating against a foreign private company - they'd be negotiating against the U.S. government, which would be considerably less keen on letting the bilking of it's taxpayers continue, and would likely demand higher payments from foreign governments for U.S. medical I.P.

First off, I reject the notion that people of wealth can become anything functionally resembling a state, especially in the context of an actual state.  Today's rich are not states.  They cannot coerce you into certain behavior by threatening your life, they cannot incarcerate you, etc.  Only the state can do that.
Secondly, people being rich just doesn't bother me whatsoever.  It doesn't hurt me, and frankly, given the results of free market capitalism versus the historic attempts at realizing socialism, it's arguably beneficial for me.


I don't think this is a problem that can meaningfully be addressed.  Attempts at realizing socialism simply replaced the class of people who had power over others, and the usual socialist retort of "Well it wasn't REAL socialism then" just falls on deaf ears.  No one should take that argument seriously, because NO actualization of ANY political ideology has EVER perfectly mirrored the on-paper version.
The people who tried to realize socialism were well-versed in Marx's writings, knew what the goals were, and STILL happened to create an immensely privileged political upper class, whose offspring had access and opportunities that the rest of the population lacked, and had prioritized access to resources like housing, food, consumer goods, etc.
Like, obviously that's not what you guys are after, but the going solution seems to be "just trust us that won't happen THIS time" ("this time" being, like, *the 13th time*).  That doesn't even get into the openly hostile rhetoric that, at least SOME of your members employ.  How DO I trust that whatever you design will be ACTUALLY democratic?


I don't.  I think we've designed an imperfect system, but a good system which encourages and allows the pursuit of one's dreams like nothing the world has ever seen before, and i think the system you propose would dampen that, frankly.  At the very least, what we have now *isn't* the "sky is falling" catastrophe it's made out to be, and there's no certainty that the proposed replacement will be as much of a slam-dunk as its advocates claim.  It is absolutely reasonable to harbor skepticism to the idea.


Agreed, which is why I don't trust socialism.

For real.  No, OP, I won't stop organizing and going to conferences in the United States.  The United States is the country that tried to peg Phil Zimmerman with a munitions export violation for inventing P.G.P, until he published the source code in a book, forcing the most powerful single institution on Earth to stand down and making Joe Biden sad.  
Also, isn't it, like, Australia and the U.K. that are considering open internet censorship literally based on "problematic content" as deemed by the government?  Wasn't it the E.U. that was butthurt by *U.S.* companies fighting the good fight for internet and software privacy, that they threatened to pass laws that would force these companies to hand over user data?  Isn't it South Korea that has mandatory internet registration, where in order to use the internet, you cannot be anonymous?
America has some of the strictest free speech protections on Earth.  Probably THE strictest.  I wonder what utopic, perfect society O.P. proposes to hold all the conferences in?

Sure.  I just don't think productivity will be anywhere close to what it needs to be to meet the demands of society at large, since one has an upper ceiling on how much of their labor they can convert into property that society will honor as "theirs."  Added to that, people wouldn't be equal in such a society - some would produce more and get more, and there's nothing implied in your description that people who produce nothing would get anything at all - so there'd still be homeless people, there's still be a lack of funding for the mentally ill, etc.
Unless you DO support some kind of system of social welfare, which would require a coercive entity functionally equivalent to the state.  And then, at that point, welfare capitalism pretty much offers the same thing, just MORE prosperity, created via MORE productivity, and the social welfare systems would have a bigger pot of wealth to draw off of.
So I'm not really seeing the advantages.

... because private insurers are the only ones who must charge market rates to provide healthcare, and are busy shifting the costs of underpayments by sovereign governments to private market payers.  You could say that that's private insurance's fault, but it'd be like blaming a retail store for raising prices in order to cover the merchandise lost through shoplifting.
Maybe other countries should have sustainable healthcare system that aren't subsidized by the American taxpayer and healthcare consumer?


The overwhelming majority of insurance claims are paid out to claimants, and you assume innocence on the part of anyone who was denied care.  Plenty of people have been untruthful on their applications, lying about or omitting health complications that they suffer from in order to score a lower premium.


Switzerland has some of the highest healthcare costs in Europe...
... because they have a robust private sector that the rest of the continent can mooch off of, like the United States.


Wait times, a political system involved in intimate, life-and-death decisions, unsustainable mandates, doubled taxes, decreased healthcare purchasing power over time due to moral hazard, etc.  Shit, you don't even live here.  In your country, healthcare magically grows on trees and doesn't cost you a thing, why do you care?  I'm not telling you how to run your healthcare system (even though I'm helping subsidize it).

They're not.  It's not the act of selling that's forced, it's the price they must sell AT that's forced.  They either cede international market share to competitors while taking a beating in the media ("*EVIL* AMERICAN PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY REFUSES TO SELL LIFESAVING DRUGS TO GERMANY"), or they suck it up and sell to these countries basically at cost.  They uniformly choose the latter, for obvious reasons.
And thank goodness they do, because the *vast* majority of pharmaceutical and biotechnology development takes place here, in the United States, which (coincidentally, I'm sure) is the only country that allows people to profit from developing medicinal implements.


I didn't claim they operated at a loss.  They *wouldn't* operate in foreign markets if they did.

Free markets and capitalism don't "cause all this trouble."  There is nothing "troubling" about free exchange between consenting, voluntary parties, except to people who choose not to participate in this arrangement in lieu of voting to force otherwise productive individuals to furnish them with free shit.




According to whom?  You?  Subjectively?  Versus the market, in which millions (if not billions) of voices have collectively spoken, and found that, yes, in fact those people *are* worth that much, because a.) they know they can walk if the bid isn't high enough, and b.) the market is willing to meet those prices.
I choose to trust the decentralized, emergent price system over the frustrations of an angry internet socialist, sorry.  Some people *are* worth a shitload of money, those people have usually built a very good reputation for themselves and that's *why* they command that kind of a price.  I *also* choose not to hate them for it, I admire them - they usually *do* embody hella work ethic and professionalism.  Those aren't bad traits, in my view - they're quite good ones.


I didn't say "nothing we can do, sorry!"  I feel for people who are genuinely unable to fend for themselves.  This system *is* unforgiving to those people.  However, I am not of the opinion that the only solution is to throw every piece of modern understanding of economics to the birds and trade our current regime of relative freedom to one of authoritarian destitution is the appropriate solution to solve this.
I don't particularly feel for people who cannot find another person to mooch off of.


I don't think we have much of a choice of whether or not we have "elites," since humans are not born with equal ability and talent.  I don't think those born with a surplus of either should be cursed by society to never enjoy them.  It sucks to not be born with them, but that's where the chips fall.  Nothing we can do about it.  I can bitch about how I'm not hot enough to woo super hot women, too, but that doesn't make me anymore entitled to their sexual attention.  The same goes for labor.




Yes, it does.  Certainly as compared to efforts in the past to implement socialism to address starvation and poverty, yeah, yeah it does work fucking wonders, comparatively.  Again, though, that's comparing results to results, rather than results to imaginary outcomes happening in literature and in the minds of people who pretend real-world material constraints don't exist.

Profit is the reward for risk.  Also, I don't think that running a multinational corporation with huge supply chains and thousands of employees requires basic-ass compensation, that's a huge job with huge responsibility, and with that comes price and incentive.
Has nothing to do with need.


I do.  Regularly.  There are homeless guys in my hometown who are regrettably in their situation, probably due to some mental illness.
Then there are homeless guys in my town who are clearly able bodied, who walk around mooching off of people for what reason I cannot say, but I damn sure don't feel sorry for them.  They got their smartphones and square card readers, but can't be bothered to go to any of the hundreds of establishments and do an honest day's work, so I'm not particularly interested in raising taxes on myself for them.


Translation: "We just need to elect the *right* people!" Naive, at best, and completely, willfully ignorant of political incentives at worst.  I don't think the political class having all the power is a good thing.  I *like* that rich people have fuck you money to thwart bureaucratic busybodies from time to time.  Checks and balances!

I do too, but bear in mind that, to many of these people, they believe a life of material deficit is not really "freedom." I find that, while their hearts are in the right place, they tend not to make the connection between "people should be provided for" and "how to motivate the people doing the providing." They'll say that "everyone should have shelter" or "everyone should have healthcare," and then completely neglect to consider how that might take place, how the people who build shelter and who render healthcare might be compelled to do so for people who they know cannot pay for it.
Usually, it ends up being "the government should *force* you to build shelter and render healthcare," which is when their virtuous position becomes significantly less virtuous.

Well that's silly, if authorities start enforcing their rules on the use of cryptocurrency, that will reduce it's value, since you could no longer use it for ALL the things it's good for, only the things it's good for that the authorities won't beat you up and put you into a cage over.  That increases risk on the user (if he/she is willing to shoulder the risk of getting authority'd by using crypto illegally), or it reduces value to the user (since he/she *isn't* willing to violate the authority's edicts, and simply "voluntarily" complies with using crypto with a reduced featureset).
Either way, Bitcoin would be worth less.  A worrying possibility is this:

Socialism and communism are virtually indistinguishable, except one is the stateless idealized end-state of the other, and both are fairy-tale ideologies not grounded in economic reality.  Democratic socialism is just a vehicle to move the Overton window in that direction, and while there are some values of the left that I appreciate, their relentless hunger for a leviathan state is one I'm not remotely interested in indulging.
I'm working for a society with less, not more, state power.

Dunno, we're a good hundred years into your act - we get it, you don't like that some people have more money than others, and want to use violence to rectify this perceived injustice.  
Fundamentally, not so different from the communists.  So little so, in fact, that I suspect if you were to realize your "democratic socialist" society with part capitalism and part enormous welfare state, the communists would become the new liberals screeching about how evil you are for supporting inequality, and you "democratic socialists" would be the new horrible right-wingers protecting ~~the fruits of people's labor~~ *the rich* and mandating inequality!

And Bitcoin has survived situations like this in the past.  The worst thing for Bitcoin would be an actual vulnerability found in Lightning, that would allow people to involuntarily steal other users' funds or something - but that's one of the things that Bitcoin has going for it, I guaran-fucking-tee there are buttloads of developers poring over the L.N. source code.  
I doubt that there is an open-source project that has had its code audited as much as Bitcoin has, *because* of the sheer value it represents.  If there was a vulnerability in L.N, I'd be shocked that someone hasn't found it yet.  Maybe they have, and are waiting for more adoption before they make their move... but they're not the only smart cookies looking at Bitcoin's code, and chances are any vulnerability would only affect the *one* participant they've got an open channel with.  If there was something that allowed them to steal funds from all connected nodes, that'd be huge, and again, TONS of people are looking at this code, and I'd be fucking *shocked* of among those people weren't some of the world's top cybersecurity experts, who are probably having more fun than they've ever had in their careers.
This is perceived as a weakness, but quite honestly?  Bitcoin's open nature and the permutability that that confers is WHY it is in it to win it, in my opinion.  Play with that fucking fire.  I won't, because I definitely just don't have the money to do that (testnet!) but it's pretty rad.

I guess I sort of do.  Not that it can't be overcome, but most people won't overcome it.  I absolutely believe that without the threat or experience of suffering, people would not work nearly as hard.  We see this with animals that enter a resource abundant situation - they multiply and overconsume until their economy can no longer sustain their population, and then they struggle.  Humans are not so different.


1. What interests them may not be of any value to society, and
2. Being given free and equal access to do so requires that they be provided food, water, shelter and healthcare *at a minimum*.  Who's providing those things?


More to the point, there are a lot of us that *wouldn't* do certain things if it weren't for money that's owed - and that's the capitalist's argument.  You're not going to take out the trash for free.


I didn't say they didn't, I said they don't get endless fuckups that everyone in society must part with their wealth to ameliorate - they get finite fuckups before they can go sleep on a park bench at night.

Hey man, HP didn't build it's reputation on nothing.  They had some legit bomb-ass printers back in the day, which I feel like "15 years ago" counts as.  As much shit as we give printers (and as much shit as they *deserve*, in some cases), some printers are real workhorses with stable, well-maintained drivers that get the job done.  Some are evil wraiths sent from hell by our worst enemies, but some are legitimately useful tools that give an average person a way to professionally disseminate reading material of their own creation.  Imagine telling someone from the Renaissance that average people would have a device that could do what they're doing with a Gutenberg press, to high levels of quality?  That's pretty powerful, IMO.
I just think that HP has become a victim of it's own success, as seems to be the fate of all successful things.  Their consumer printers are garbage, and there's no question that the run an almost cartel-like business model for inkjets.  And who could blame them?  We enable them, it just annoys me that for *all* of the money these people get to swim in because of the ink racket, they can't even make stable, good drivers, uninstallers, etc.  I find more and more that business products are the way to go, across the board.

Nothing works in the *long* run, but I would argue capitalism has better systems in place for improvement (as it essentially subjects social institutions to an evolution-like selection process) and better respects people's right to self-determination.  A consequence of this is that some people in the right place and the right time with the right idea, can get filthy fucking rich.  And I just don't see that as a problem, nor as some kind of moral injustice that causes poverty.
Poverty is the default state of things.

No, they don't.  Social democracies, which finance their lavish social programs off of fully-functioning free markets and private property ownership (read:  capitalism), are some of the most prosperous places that exist.

And in the United States, we have state-run education, Fannie Mae 
and Freddie Mac, and many, many others - each with a record of folly and waste (to include public education).  So, even capitalist America has some socialist elements to it (much to my disappointment) - that doesn't make is a "socialist" country.  Realistically, Canada and Europe are maybe a degree more socialist than we are (fully socialist healthcare), but not by much.


But the likelihood of that contract being respected and enforced by the entity whom you are entrusting to respect and enforce it is much greater in America, Canada, and Europe than it is in Venezuela - and *that's* what makes the difference.  In the West, a breach of a person or organization's property rights is a big deal, and they have a shot at representing themselves before the state and the state *can lose* - let's see that happen in Venezuela.






Your evidence for this is an article detailing how the government will seize property accumulation past a certain point.  I can't imagine why anyone wouldn't want to start a business there!  I rest my case.

I wish them the best.  Maduro has probably passed the point at which he could've stepped down amicably and been given a respectable place in the history books - unusual for socialists, but he's been cracking down and being pretty authoritarian for long enough that that is rightly going to be denied to him.

Governments with free markets are almost universally NOT socialist.  You can own property in Canada and in virtually every country in Europe.  They're not socialist countries.




While true, I would argue that a capitalist economy that allows and encourages its citizens to engage in business and protects property would be far better able to weather the storm through economic diversification.  Venezuela basically forbids that, to their own, predictable suffering.
They could allow for some entrepreneurs, but that would mean some of them might be successful, and that'd just be the worst thing - so, you know, better to just make everyone starve.

Because words mean things, and the semantics involved in politics are already fragmented and micromanaged to the point of being almost barely usable, and the term "social democracy" generally refers to something resembling a European nation, which is far friendlier to business and private property than Venezuela is.

I mean, maybe, but I do think it's accurate.  We're animals, not these turbo-exceptional beings that we like to think we are.  Yes, we are the universe experiencing itself - we're also just animals who overthink and eat and poop like the rest of them, and I don't think biologists have *ever* recorded a scenario wherein animals, who come into a surplus of resources, don't then immediately consume those resources and then face famine and death.


Right, but we're not talking about "cheap," we're talking about "free," which we irrationally (or, perhaps *quite* rationally, depending on how you look at it) overvalue.  Like the example of animals over consuming available resources, I would add to that that we have very few experiences of some good or service being artificially priced at below the market rate that doesn't get over consumed.
You give *x* million people an option to have free housing, and some of those people simply will avail themselves of that option.  My bet?  An increasing percentage of that population will take it, year after year after year, costing more and more.  Then you have a permanent class of people who get to live for free (supported by people who *don't* get to live for free - where is the fairness in this relationship) and who will protect that economic windfall in the voting booth (entirely rationally, at that).
@_date: 2018-04-03 12:59:55
And then shockingly, creatures who are dependent on resources to survive and will expend the minimum possible effort to acquire them, will decide that not working and getting a free place to stay (rent being one of the larger expenses a person incurs regularly) is a better deal, so your "real profit" ends up decimating productivity and economic output while almost certainly costing taxpayers *more* in the long run.

How is this "not necessarily a bad thing" when the primary selling point of this is "it'll save money?" The only way it isn't "a bad thing" is if the costs of free housing undershoot the historical costs of incarceration.  I don't think they will, in the long run.


Right, but it's got this key selling point: *It's free.*


You're assuming that.  I'm not.  I don't think nearly as many people as you think would turn down free housing, especially over time, as social attitudes towards it change to become more positive, etc.  People *presently* feel at least SOME sense of shame for living off someone else's nickel, if they didn't they'd certainly be more willing to do it.


Yes, it is.  I can make peace with some social programs, if they're producing results.  They almost never do, and they almost always produce dependence, which never, ever goes away.  So, you can understand the reticence which I exhibit when it is suggested that the government should give out yet-another free thing.
It isn't supposed to be directly reciprocal, but barring any serious physical or mental maladies which prevent a person from being an additive member of society, most of the population isn't just going to be cool with their blood, sweat, and tears going to some otherwise perfectly able-bodied person.
To quote the late, great, Iron Lady: "The problem with socialism is that you always run out of other people's money." If a large enough percentage of your population decides to say "fuck it" and live for free, you don't have the population working to support the government via taxes (delightful) and shortages abound, because why would merchants and censors do business in a place where free people work?
