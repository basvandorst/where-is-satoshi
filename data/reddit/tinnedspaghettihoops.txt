I think it's coincidental.
What you need to do is send me all your bitcoin and i will keep it safe from forks.

Nah, am good thanks.

I am aware, my point is that I know I was typing the right 6 digit code and shouldn't have had to recover. if that bit is broken, it's entirely possible for other things to be broken.
Imagine a situation where, when I'm sending coins, it adds extra characters to the address by accident, or maybe even truncates the address? In bith cases the coins would be lost.
Also, while I've got you: The changing positions of the numerical keypad is so very, very very irritating.  (you know, the way the numbers are all in a different place every time?)

Another reason is hardware wallet available; in the U.S. there are plenty of options, whereas in the U.K. for example, the options are limited, require a transaction in Euros (for which you pay the "foreign transaction" fee for) and shipping is ridiculous in both price and speed for what is essentially a usb memory stick with a screen in a box no bigger or heavier than a calculator.
Supply and support of hardware wallets needs to improve.
@_date: 2017-07-18 17:22:24
I've just doubled my BTC holding.  I'm still 50/50 as to what's going to happen. For me this is a gamble and so I did what I always do when I gamble; I looked away from the screen onClick and won't tell anyone I did it unless I win :P
My ETH holding is looking good though, definitely up from the weekend lows, but has not yet reached the line where I buy back into Litecoin with it (I do a dance with ETH and LTC that no one else is invited to, which has made me a reasonable profit so far)

The real question is, why, when you check the "don't require ID" box, assholes who want ID still show up, you just don't see until you click in to the listing.
As it transpires, if you don't want to submit ALL YOUR ID AS WELL AS THAT OF YOUR KIDS AND PETS AND A SEMEN SAMPLE bittylicious works out way cheaper.
F**K LBTC.

Fun story:
Yesterday I tried to access my Samurai wallet. It told me my 6 digit passcode was wrong and after three attempts at what I kbew was definitely the right code, it locked me out and asked me for another passcode. 
I entered the other passcode, which went through immediately and was shown a toast notification reminding me of my 6 digit code, which was the same as the one I had entered three times and locked myself out with.
I removed Samurai wallet from my android device. Fuck losing my coins to a glitch in their code.

I'm using exodus.  The fork looks to have been avoided. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 11:05:32
What is the reason? 
@_date: 2017-07-30 20:37:36
Tomorrow I'd expect modest movements.
Most exchanges are shutting down withdrawals and will probably halt trades a good bit before the fork as well.
If people are wanting to move in to BTC or out, they're going to want to do it sooner rather than later.

@_date: 2017-07-18 21:25:33
Yes. But my point is, the 6 digit code I typed was definitely correct, and that was confirmed after I performed recovery, but i shouldn't have had to recover, because it should have accepted the correct 6 digit code.  If that's broken, what else is?

Not lost anything, I was playing with it before deciding whether to use it for actually storing coins. I generally try to break these things; the harder it is to break em, the more reliable it is. Samurai was, unfortunately, very easy to break. :p

I know it's hard, but now you must devote your energy to your recovery plan.  Maybe something will happen that might make it so you can get your coins back, and you can keep an eye on reddit et all to get the skinny, but right now, you need to go to work.

I got a sniff of this yesterday... Still not sure but you'll see if you go through my post history, I've been calling "exit scam" on Polo for a while. 
Obviously the jury is out, a random 4chaner can't exactly be relied upon but Poloniex has been going down the shitter for months, take a look at the forums.
