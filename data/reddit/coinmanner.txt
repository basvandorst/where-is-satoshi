I thought paying the fee would do it, but it seems not to  (that is a test)

But how can the rest of the network accept a block that's breaking the "soft rule" if most of the nodes implements that rule?
Let's say that some miner A don't apply the soft rule and accept my transaction. Why should the rest of the network accept it then? Why would they even care? Can miner A enforce my block onto the whole network even though they don't like small transactions?

It seems so. But I've read everywhere that such transactions will fall back? That the minimum amount you have to output per address is 5400 satoshis?

I run a similar service (Coinbox is thus my enemy). My problem is paying the users - the btc network refuses my payments.

If the network forget about my current spending (which it probably will eventually), do I not technically have my coins then again?

But... wait. So if one miner accepts my transaction, it's stored in the bitcoin database forever in all nodes? So that transaction will be synced with all bitcoin clients? (it'll get global forever so to speak)?

It has now got 5 confirmations, so there's absolutely no going back now?
But still.. how can some miners get the transaction inserted into the database while other wouldn't mine it in the first place? doesn't that mean that some fake miners can introduce false transactions then? Or will the other miners be FORCED to mine those transactions anyway once some few others have?
