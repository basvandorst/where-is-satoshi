You should read the lightning network conversations on some other subs going on right now.

I could see VC investment slowing with all of this uncertainty about the blocksize debate.

Is there a truly decentralized wallet that is also multi-sig?

What a complicated card.  If bitcoin is going to be adopted, let's just use QR codes and phones.  At most, NFC.  All the tech necessary already exists.  This should be a mostly software transition, not a hardware one.  Granted, Grandma wants a card to carry around, but let's face it: grandma is probably going to die before she starts using bitcoin.

+1 for open bazaar.  It's almost out.  Just wait a week or two.

Soooo......  No?

Jeez, what a complicated roundabout way to accept bitcoin.  But if you want to spend bitcoin anywhere, I'm sure it works.
You could stay out of major retailers, and choose to shop at small local stores.  Strike up a conversation about bitcoin, and see if they would be willing to accept it.  Even asking the question: "Do you accept bitcoin?"  makes all the difference.

well, explain it better then.  Doesn't help us to just ramble on about how dumb someone else's opinion is without actually refuting it.

They have.  I would imagine that it's pretty easy to slip an employee in, and update proprietary code.

shit THIS should be the top comment.

The polite thing to do here would be to delete this post.  Nobody, including this guy, deserves his private life to be aired like that.
@_date: 2015-12-18 21:08:09
Oh I think they already have.

Ending the censorship would be a start.

Right, but monetary value lies with bitcoin itself.  I'm asking what happens when bitcoin is used as a settlement for other crypto transactions.  The thing is, I'm not sure how lightning network works, I need to see it/feel it/use it, but the way its describes makes me nervous for the value of bitcoin itself, from my current understanding.

Oh for fucks sake

Because they get to reinvest your money already.  It's not like the banks actually let your money sit there.  Your question makes it sound like you think that banks don't already make a shit-ton of money.  ATMs also already charge fees, so they're generally in the positive there.  And credit cards? Are you fucking kidding me?  Sure buddy, they don't make any money off of those.....
