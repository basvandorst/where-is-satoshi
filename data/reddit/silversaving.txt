Up vote for Philippines.  My wife's from Cebu.  
I'd buy a little now and a little later.  You don't have to do an "all or nothing" buy.

I've bought a few bitcoins off coinbase now, and they still haven't asked for any ID or picture of me....
Last time was just 2 days ago.  No idea why they have different rules for different people
@_date: 2017-02-11 04:24:42
I was one of them.  Brand spankin new to all this.

Thanks...wish I'd been a year earlier.  Oh well, better late then never.

I'd say I first heard in maybe the second half of 2014?  I recall it had just bumped up from 260ish to 300+ and I told myself if it dropped back down to $250 I'd go get some....then I tried educating myself and could not for the life of me figure out and easy way to buy them.  People LOVED talking about wallets and places that would accept bitcoin but I couldn't find a newbie friendly place to just take my money and give me coins.  So I forgot about it and concentrated on gold/silver for a while (oh well)....now back to bitcoin since the price has gone up a ton ....story of my life.  
Why did I sign up?  Because for a whole lot of years I've known our money supply is going to shit.  They will continue to print....we will continue to see our standard of living decline.  So I'm buying anything and everything that is an inflation hedge.

Ditto, wouldn't mind a discount to pick up more.  But honestly nobody knows the future, we're all just guessing

Actually I've found the opposite to be true in my experience. Millions easy ways to do it, but check out if you'd like to quickly buy or sell something

Yep, right there with you boss.

I have on of [these from AMSEC]( and swear by it.  I actually do keep gold (and silver) in it. Plenty of space for a few thousand ounces as well as important documents. Crazy heavy for the size, but much tougher then you gun safes from costco.

As you can probably guess from my username, I started in Silver/gold as a form of wealth preservation.  Recently I've moved over and started adding a bitcoin position.  We all pretty much know the worlds fiats are going down the drain fast, so now we all look for things that (even if they don't appreciate much), will hold their value long term.

Gold is the 2nd oldest form of currency (to silver) in the world and is not in any trouble.  It was in use before Christ was born and will be going strong well after we are dust in the ground.  
Your problem is simply that you are more knowledgeable about the bitcoin market then you are about the precious metals market.  I've bought and sold many thousands in PMs and have zero difficulty.  I can have my money about 35 minutes sooner then you got yours via your bitcoin transaction (into my paypal or google wallet).  There are numerous places to sell and honestly a pawn shop should be your absolute LAST resort in an emergency.   Selling gold at a pawn is like selling bitcoin at a pawn, you are going to have to accept some pretty bad spreads.  Much like you want to sell bitcoin to other bitcoin enthusiasts for maximum profit, you want to sell PMs to other PM collectors and enthusiasts.
I'll first point you to if you want a quick easy fix, if you're seriously interested in the buying/selling of PMs just send me a note and I can point you towards some good options.
Edit to add that yes, I also hodl bitcoin.  I believe in diversification.

I'm one of the new signups on their site.  New to bitcoin and they seemed easiest to buy from.  They didn't ask for any verification besides entering 2 numbers they sent to my bank account. Was then able to purchase $1000 in bitcoin from them.  But they have not asked me for any photo ID.

Best I know of is Exodus.  It has shapeshift built in and will show you the price in dollars if you select it.
