The teacher should not be grading papers based upon preconceived notions but how well their students frame and make arguments. I am not sure what the objective of this assignment was, and the teacher probably doesn't either.
In your meeting, ask the teacher what the rubric was. Was the paper given a 0 because it was written using poor grammar? Was it written without addressing the questions posed in the assignment? Was it written without the desired structure?

Saving, which causes businesses to cut production, which deflates economic growth. People without investments SHOULD save. The stock market is doing fine, but that's for people with capital assets such as stocks and bonds. People without capital should be saving who rely upon labor wages with privatized pensions should be very concerned.

Before the recession most people didn't have savings accounts. They relied upon credit to maintain their living standards because wages have been depressed for about 30 years. But it's okay for corporations to sit on almost $1.2 trillion.
It's as if they want the lambs to meet the lions at the slaughter.

Will you be going to Zambia? Zambia is one of the fastest growing economies in all of sub-Saharan Africa. It is also politically stable and has a rapidly growing middle class, with a very established upper class. Most South African chains such as Shoprite, Pick n' Pay, Hungry Lion, Pizza Inn, etc. can be found in Zambia.

Are you concerned with Bitcoin as being a currency used to empower capital flight from these countries?
@_date: 2015-01-25 20:22:11
I really, really doubt that unfortunately. Bitcoin would be the perfect country to smuggle money out of sub-Saharan countries, especially for Chinese mining companies to skirt local taxes. I don't see capital growth occuring from Bitcoin in sub-Saharan Africa affecting low income growth any time soon.

More capital flees sub-Saharan Africa than comes in through development aid, especially in countries with high levels of resource wealth. I can see Bitcoin being used as a primary currency in removing capital from countries such as Mali, DRC, and Zambia in order to skirt financial controls and laws, especially by foreign mining corporations. It isn't a matter of creating restrictions, it is about enforcing restrictions. Some foreign companies are very good at corrupting their local government to skirt paying local taxes and underpaying their local staff. I am worried that Bitcoin will be used to bypass all the regulators and government institutions that are already weak.

If Bitcoin can get on with Airtel Money, that will be huge. Airtel is an Indian-based cellular company that provides service in most of sub-Saharan Africa.

Yeah, well you can tell that to the financial regulators in Kenya, Zambia, and Uganda who feel powerless in stopping capital flight. Bitcoin will probably be outlawed in much of sub-Saharan Africa. I honestly see the consequences far worse than the benefits. Do you really think that investors will invest using the most volatile currency in the world in some of the world's riskiest markets?

The government is not in charge of monetary policy, the Fed is.

Yeah...Milton Friedman led the "Chicago School" movement which deposed popular socialist leaders in South America and put into power essentially puppets thay violently suppressed any popular dissent.
Also, Greenspan was a fan of Friedman and look how well financial deregulation did for mortgage backed securities.
@_date: 2015-02-15 07:04:46
To be fair, deregulation does increase allocative efficiency in some respects. That is the point Friedman made.

For those who downvoted me, take intro to macroeconomics. The Fed is an independent organization.

It was a large part of it. Deregulation helped contribute to the creation of bubbles on a global scale, and when they popped, asset prices dropped while debt obligations remained fixed. These bubbles were created by investment banks which had a huge pool of money saved up from when developing countries opened their economies up to the global marketplace. Governments across the globe fought these bubbles from bursting on an individual basis, neglecting the true cause--over zealous investors wanting to get rich quick sitting on an $80 trillion pool of securities. Investors ran circles around regulators, creating then bursting bubbles, primarily in Asia. The early 2000s housing boom was one such bubble.
Like I said, assets were devalued because of bursting market bubbles, yet debt obligations remained fixed. These debt obligations were then securitized, stamped with AAA ratings, and made toxic because people couldn't pay off their loans anymore because of soaring interest rates. Investment banks saw MBS products as very hot investments because they were AAA certified, when in reality they were economic poison.
The people who defaulted were led into taking predatory loans such as subprime mortgage loans like lambs to the slaughter. They were set up by design to default. Investors were just too greedy to know the forest for the trees, that they were about to be undone by an instrument of their own making. Lehman Brothers was overleveraged with toxic MBS assets, along with many other investment banks because they were used to create bubbles, get rich off of securitized debt obligations, which everyone thought was safe thanks to the ratings system, which they bought and sold, then watch as they burst, where debtors suffered the consequences.
Effective regulators would have seen the crisis from a mile away. We didn't have effective regulators because those in charge of regulatory agencies such as the SEC are a part of the problem--they are the investors, just on a vacation. The US housing bubble was just one in a long string of market bubbles that contributed towards the crash. It however, was one one that finally broke their backs.
