Had my volume up a tad too loud at the beginning.  That "drop it" scared the shit out of me.  10/10 would get scared and watch again.

A little late, but I'm running into the same exact issue.  Did yours eventually get past rewinding blocks?

Oh wow, I have no idea how I got a hold of 13.0.2 lol.  Ill download this one and give it a go.  Thanks!
Edit: No go; still rewinding blocks?

Site is a scam.  Ordered a blade, waited a few days, no information about it shipping, sent an email asking where it was, got a round about answer to email someone else, no reply for a few days, decided to ask for a refund then unfortunately was replied with this message:
"haha lol fuck off niggger." 
These sites are always a gamble, just gotta learn to be careful next time.

How does one get into mining Litecoins?  I've looked at it before, and got a little confused.. any tips for beginners?  or sites to visit?

Bought 8  sold at $97 when they were sitting there for a while.  Very sad about that.  Been buying bits and pieces back for a while and mining, so there's that.

Nice try Heisenberg.

I guess that would drive the point of the post even deeper.  The only thing I can think of is people just buying a shit ton of the usb miners as opposed to the BFL sets.  Even then one would think your ROI would never be met.

Could have doubled your money by now.  :)
