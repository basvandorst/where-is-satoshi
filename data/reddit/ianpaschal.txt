Fine. Upgrade depends who you are asking but the point is that upgrading Bitcoin (assuming you like the change) is also a hard fork.
@_date: 2018-01-10 19:02:58
Sorry, those comments were collapsed by default.
Any fork is technically still Bitcoin as they come from the same source and share the same blockchain history. If you insist that the code can't be forked then upgrades are impossible and segwit is also not "real Bitcoin" either. The only continuity depends on who supports it and what people call it. And since BCH actually implements Satoshi's design, it has a pretty fucking legitimate to be "Bitcoin".
Now if you don't really understand the principles of code and how it's upgraded, that's fine, most don't, and I can see how the argument then follows that a complicated thing shouldn't be made more complicated by different versions sharing the same brand, but in that case, man up and admit that Bitcoin Gold and Bitcoin Knots do exactly the same vs. coming up with their own branding.

No, you’re right, but it is comparable to a SemVer major upgrade.
All upgrades to bitcoin are hard forks. The only thing that was different about this one is that half the community didn’t adopt the new protocol and the other half did.
But forks are how blockchains upgrade.

I just tested with some coins (5 cent euro pieces, but that doesn't matter).
Going down the row, although every other row is shifted by d/2 (d = coin diameter), there's no reduction compared to if they're laid out in a grid.
The rows however do compress between each other a bit when they "inter lock". d, in this case, is 21 mm, but due to the interlocking the tops of next row are 18 mm from the tops of the last row. So you get d*(1/7) less coverage in that direction.
This proportion should stay the same for any circles in a hex pattern.
So by my math your estimate is about 15% too low.

How is that any different than Bitcoin Cash? It's name is still Bitcoin + Something.
@_date: 2018-01-20 21:57:44
A hard fork is just a non backwards compatible upgrade. The semantic difference between fork and upgrade is that in an upgrade the old protocol is abandoned. The only reason BCH was a fork instead an upgrade is because so much of the community didn’t upgrade. Had everyone adopted the new protocol it would have just been another stage of Bitcoin’s evolution.

It's not though. Both coins share the same blockchain history up to 01-08-2017 and one of them actually aligns to what the author of "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System" described as scaling. That's empirically provable.
You can argue Satoshi was wrong in his scaling proposal, and that's fine; he's not omniscient or infallible, *but*: Calling Bitcoin Cash "Bitcoin" is empirically, objectively, accurate. It's not trying to confuse. It's trying to set the record straight.

Depends who pays it right?
In the Netherlands the company pays that, along with your share of unemployment insurance, pension, etc. before the money ever hits your bank account (which is fucking awesome IMO). The only taxes I have to pay myself are my annual municipal taxes for garbage collection and such which are tied to my address instead of my work.
So in such a system, I would not be avoiding any taxes; my company would just pay X euros to the government and Y bitcoin to me each month.

But yeah anyway that sucked. And then I got home on August 5 and checked the price and said "Oh, it's only €2400, that's too bad for me but it's not sooooo bad." And then the next morning when I was sleeping and jetlagged it *really* took off.

As u/padauker says, it will put pressure on the price. When I started trying to day trade, all of a sudden this formerly unknown color squiggle became super useful for predicting the price. When the green side becomes much bigger than the red, it means there is high demand and the price goes up. When the red side becomes much bigger, it means there's lots of intention to sell, so reduced demand, so reduced price. It's not a perfect weathervane but it gives you an idea of what direction the price is headed to in the next hour.

That is not at all what an open market is.


Only if it settles down at some point. No one looks at a currency and says "Wow it's valuation fluctuates wildly and every few months or years it's replaced by something else so this new thing must be *really* good. In fact, it hasn't been stable in years, so you know what that means! Fantastic!"
It's a huge misconception that the progress is guaranteed to be forward, as well. There's no guarantee that BIP 957 is actually better than BIP 731. It's entirely possible for a fork to fork again returning to an earlier concept for many reasons. Maybe BIP 957 is undoing a lot of poor design decisions from BIP 933. Then it just looks like the people behind it don't know what they want. Or rather, that this is all just an experiment, which, you know... it is.
People might reach your conclusion but it's unfounded and frankly a little dumb.
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:14:06
Not at all. That's like saying if you are into a dangerous hobby mountain climbing or sky diving you shouldn't worry about safety because its inherently dangerous. If anything the only people who should be owning Bitcoin are those who concern themselves with safety.
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:44:25
Generally the safe advice would be to "wait until the dust settles." It will become more apparent over time what is "the real Bitcoin" and if it's useful to keep both, or to dump one or the other, etc. Also *if* (and I'm not saying this like it's going to happen) the hard fork actually does behave like a hard upgrade, and everyone decides "Ok, so Segwit2x is pretty OK, from now on, we'll use that," and you've dumped all your B2X in favor of the now defunct and incompatible BTC... well that will not be so great. Shaking support for B2X and bad publicity as a corporate takeover means I don't think that's going to happen, but it *could*.
People are pretty vicious about their ideology but if you can avoid being attached to thinking one coin is surely the holy and promised savior, you avoid either being extremely right or extremely wrong, the latter of which could mean you essentially threw away all your money.
I've learned the hard way that there's nothing more valuable in Bitcoin than patience if you're not an insider. Watch and wait.
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:26:37
If you sold all of them? Then no. The Bitcoin Cash was created on August 1st so whoever was holding your sold coins at that date is who got the Bitcoin Cash associated with it.
If you sold *after* August 1st, you could get a Bitcoin Cash wallet, put in the seed of your old Bitcoin wallet, and whatever your balance on August 1st was would now be in that wallet.

Those are Dutch street lights (and tidy Dutch row houses) so um... maybe Bitcoin? Nah.
@_date: 2017-11-03 07:56:23
I agree with your sentiment but it does seem to touch upon what for me is Bitcoin's greatest flaw: the 21 million cap. It makes Bitcoin far too deflationary making it:
1. A bad idea to spend, because no matter what you buy, it will have been worth more tomorrow.
2. Dangerous to loan because the debt dramatically increases over time.
Most countries consider a small level of inflation to be ideal, if we really didn't want that the flow of bitcoins could be tailored to a zero inflation rate or a slight deflation rate. But if you look into a future with widespread adoption, exploding earth population, and more and more Bitcoins lost to forgotten keys and wallets, etc. the rarity will go through the roof. Plus there will likely be a breaking point where even 1 satoshi is a big chunk of change.
So frankly IMO while I'm not complaining about the price of my crypto portfolio, not allowing for the indefinite creation of more Bitcoin has ultimately doomed Bitcoin in the end. The "ride" will end someday unless that protocol is changed, so it's understandable that I'm just excitedly waiting for the eventual highest all-time-high to end all all-time-highs.
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:01:18
Happy to help! Bitcoin is a bit extra tricky to learn about it takes a lot of advanced ideas and terms from both the world of technology and the world of finance.
@_date: 2017-11-18 15:10:19
Sorry, you understand completely wrong. This is not possible because of floating point errors.
Bitcoin wallets actually move Satoshis. That's the true single unit. The hard cap of 21m Bitcoins is actually a hard cap of 2,100,000,000,000,000 Satoshis.
Sub-dividing Satoshis would introduce floating point errors in code. Dividing Satoshis into a factor of 10 (i.e. adding another decimal place) is not any different than making the hard cap 210 million smaller (1/10th) bitcoins instead of 21 million current-sized ones. Why? Because a Satoshi must remain a whole number, so the hard cap becomes 21,000,000,000,000,000 satoshis (10x more) and 1 current BTC becomes 10 of the new BTC.
Edit: To whoever downvoted this, I can try to explain more, but I'm not wrong. ;)

I'm not really familiar with GreenAddress. And I don't have much time today to look into it. Best thing you can often do, especially if it's a smaller company, is send them an email asking about how they will handle the fork, what kind of user action might be required, etc.
Generally though I wouldn't recommend anyone using a wallet send to an exchange for the sake of the fork. It's just that if "your"* coins are there, a fork is a crappy time to start moving them around if you're a newbie. Better to just leave it there.
The simple question about GreenAddress would be: Do *you* have your own keys? If so, *you* will get B2X. If you don't, you'll need to figure out who does have your private keys, and ask if they're going to credit your account with B2X, let you withdraw it and use it somewhere else, or just keep it for themselves (sounds dickish but some companies do exactly that...)
*Coins you gave them for safe keeping/trading/etc. with the expectation they'll give them back when you want to withdraw.
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:18:06
If you're a newbie, I'd recommend keeping you coins on Coinbase for now. When you trade on GDAX, you and the seller/taker don't actually move any Bitcoin. The transaction is only recorded in Coinbase's servers, not the block chain. All the coins are actually in Coinbase's vaults, so they decide what happens to them. Coinbase is actually one of the few exchanges I know of which has actually spelled out in clear text that they will credit you with equal amounts of BTC and B2X at the moment of fork, which is good. They didn't do this with BCH which pissed a lot of people off, while Kraken.com did. Now Kraken is staying silent on the issue. Very irritating that there's not a norm for exchanges to follow but if you are a newbie keeping your coins on an exchange, I'd recommend Coinbase for *this* round. It's not a good strategy forever, though, so at some point switch to hodling and spending with a wallet, and only keeping your day-to-day trading liqudity on an exchange.
There are many people here who believe everyone should use a wallet but unless you're careful about keeping it secure, and willing to take the steps to keep it as such, you're better off trusting a company who knows what they're doing. I might get downvoted for this but I really believe while it's great Bitcoin lets you be your own "bank vault" if you *want*, many people are better off using a professional's "bank vault" like Coinbase's even if it means putting your trust in them.
If you have your own wallet (meaning you have your private key/12 word seed) the situation is the same: you'll have equal amounts of BTC and B2X at the moment of split. But it's a bit more complicated and there's maybe other people who can explain this better. It's complicated because unlike Bitcoin Cash, which was clear in its intent to split off from Bitcoin as a fork, Segwit2x is seen by some as a hard upgrade, not a hard fork. This means both Segwit1x and Segwit2x consider themselves to be "***the*** Bitcoin blockchain". This has a lot of implications and needs to be sorted out by the community and network before things return to "business as usual." For that part, I'm going to let someone else take over; I need to get back to work!
@_date: 2017-11-09 01:25:16


First of all I'm not blaming the Bitcoin community for a few people signing an agreement. I am blaming them for letting this get as ugly as it did. Both sides are responsible for this. Also I've said in other comments that I'm not necessarily a fan of S2X but it would have been a stop-gap at a time when we needed a stop-gap. A slightly larger block size is a simple solution, still used segwit, was "certified Nakamoto", and could still totally have a lightning network built on top of it someday when that's ready. But no. God forbid we implement even a compromised measure of what should have been done years ago. In my humble opinion, that's highly irrational.


I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume that you're actually smart enough to know:
1. Bcash is not Bitcoin Cash. You're just saying that to irritate it's proponents. It's a childish tactic and a moderator of a Bitcoin forum should hold themselves to a higher standard than trolls and shills.
2. Bitcoin Cash has its weaknesses like the fuck-up that was the EDA. But it also delivers on the promise of low fees and a cleared out mempool that have been a distant memory of Bitcoin for a while now.
I find it *so* disappointing that people make this kind of remark. In my comments to newbies today I tried to preach general agnosticism and skepticism. Bitcoin is an experiment, not a religion, and all varieties and forks should be both openly considered and regarded critically. There are measurable strong points to both BTC and BCH. Anyone who cannot bring themselves to recognize this has no place in finance or computer science.


This "meteoric bull run" is not sustainable growth and adoption and not that relevant to the big picture. My statement is entirely based on the fact that Bitcoin still has no scaling protocol in place, and people are still making topics about "what a bunch of shit heads the other guys are." In this battle no one won. Everyone is still dead and the status quo remains intact. Then I thought about it and realized that everyone who was not on one side or another is the winner. Alts was maybe a bad way to characterize this.


As follow up from my remark above: I'm telling anyone who will listen to avoid taking sides over cryptocurrency. When we reach the point we can't even debate the ideas we don't agree with without screeching "Troll!", we are truly fucked.
@_date: 2017-11-08 09:29:09
Essentially a non-backwards-compatible upgrade. In theory it's more of a "hard upgrade"  and everyones switches to the new system. *But* if some people adamantly believe the new system is a mistake and keep using the old system, then the hard upgrade becomes a hard fork where two non-compatible systems are now in use.
For example, upgrading USB 2.0 to USB 3.0 is a soft fork, you can use it or not but they're still compatible. Then along comes USB-C. If everyone instantly starts using all USB-C hardware and plugs, no problem: the whole world of USB has now been upgraded. But since this is real life and things aren't that simple, some devices have USB-C and some devices have USB 3 and can't be used together. USB has effectively "hard forked."
_**EDIT FOR FUTURE READERS:** The comments below here were all written prior to the announcement of Segwit2X's cancellation. Remarks like, "You could use Coinbase because they will credit your account with B2X" are no longer relevant so keep that in mind when reading._
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:18:04
This is a separate issue. Regardless of speculation, the fact that Bitcoin is so deflationary makes it a very poor currency, as you point out. I'm buy it and as an investment, and using it, and also getting as many people as I know to use it as well.
I suppose I can make a disclaimer that as the Bitcoin protocol stands now, I do not think it will survive. As you point out, a currency that is so deflationary is not usable, but using Bitcoin and encouraging businesses to accept it and customers to spend it, only will make it even more valuable. A change will have to be made eventually (IMO removing the 21 million cap and just having a small block reward pay out indefinitely to make up for lost coins and increasing population), before it's useable as currency (or usable as more than a novelty as it is now).
But while this is going on, I'm happy that my Bitcoin holdings are slowly appreciating value much more nicely than my savings account at my bank. In that sense, it's a better investment.

Yup. To use another tech example, it's a bit like if you save `myCoin.btc` and then do a save as `myCoin.b2x`. Same amount of money, but now in two different formats.
As for which fork you're working with... well... that's the shitty part of this. With forks like Bitcoin Cash, there was "replay protection" which meant that when you send some BCH, your BTC was untouched. Even though BCH absolutely aligns more closely with Satoshi's white paper, this means that on a technical level BCH is like an alt coin with its own separate blockchain. Segwit2X, however, does not want to be an alt coin or spin off. Its proponents believe it is the real Bitcoin and should use the BTC symbol and the BTC blockchain. In such cases sending out a transaction from a BTC wallet could cause you to send the money twice, in two currencies.
Different entities have released different statements about how they will handle this. For example, some places say "We will consider the coin with the most hashing power mining it to be the real Bitcoin" but others might say "We will consider S2X the real Bitcoin because we hate core."
This makes the waters murky and a bit dangerous to conduct business in. As for how handle this and avoid double spending, there's not much you can do yourself because it depends on the whole eco-system.
As I said in another comment to someone else, unless you are an insider who knows something everyone else doesn't, patience is pretty much always the best policy. Wait and see what happens and it will become clear if S2X is something to hodl, dump, find a new wallet for, etc.
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:06:29
Also unable to withdraw. No warning whatsoever. I'm sincerely done with Kraken this time, even if I have to go somewhere else to buy BCH.
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:05:51
Don't want to get in trouble for promoting alt coins but you should consider every cyrpto currency independent of a particular community. This one has a strong preference for BTC, the other Reddit community has a strong preference for BCH. Head over there to read why people prefer it.
The th;dv (too hard, didn't visit) is that BTC is in need of a scaling solution and rather than use the one Satoshi proposed, Blockstream artificially crippled it in order to create the need for off chain solutions which Blockstream will sell. Someday.
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:12:15


Yes. But I see you're "Redditor for 2 weeks". Soon you'll learn that most people on both of these forums treat it like a religous holy war and if you disagree with prevailing sentiments in either community you'll be attacked/called a shill/told you don't believe in or udnerstand Bitcoin.


At the time of split, yes. Many who thought it was BS sold it though (at prices they felt they were taking advantage of, like $600) and are being made fun of now in because BCH is clearly here to stay.


Avoid it if you can, and do research on both the politics and technology from other sources if you can.
@_date: 2017-11-18 15:12:07
It's not. You cannot simply start treating the `int` values for Satoshis into `float`s.
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:03:22
Yeah. What do you mean, Yet? It's only going to be worse. If Bitcoin actually gains more widespread adoption it will only become worse and worse to spend. No one will want to buy anything because it's worth more the next day, and debts will balloon in value. Imagine buying a house with Bitcoin and the debt on the house increases a rate of 100x or 1000x the rate at which the actual property increases value.
And sure, there could be other coins we use for day-to-day purchases but then we're just back to where we are now: using euros and dollars and hodling Bitcoin.
"But Bitcoin is only meant to be a store of value!" some claim. Well first of all, no, that's not what it's *meant* to be, maybe it is, though. Second of all, it simply *must* bring more to the table than that because any block chain can store value, regardless of the units. If that is what Bitcoin is bringing to the table without every-day usage, then this truly is a speculative bubble, not a surge in adoption and usage.
The 21m cap is, IMO, one of, or perhaps the only, bad design decision on Nakamoto's part. There's a middle ground between "no new coins ever" and "government can create more fiat whenever they please." Having a mathematical model that keeps inflation within a certain percent (maybe 2, maybe 0, maybe -1, who knows) and which introduces more coins in fair, distributed, consistent way is by far the best option IMO.
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:01:30




Me too. Are you implying that less capacity is better?


Right. Because the only thing that matters is the exchange rate right? That's not the mark of a functional digital currency.
Also, I'm not "from I've been on longer and I discuss more here. I'm also quick to tease that they care more about censorship on Reddit than Bitcoin.

Most ancient money was "fiat" or "fiat-like" in that it was merely a recording of debt. In fact, it was common that after the collapse of an empire its currency was still used out of convenience. No one was lugging around gold and ancient economies were not barter based like people assume. Also no coins were worth anything or made of precious metal; if they were people would just melt down the coins instead of using them for transactions.
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:06:10


Nice. You know nothing about me but suggest I don't understand Bitcoin or the concept of decentralization (that's just insulting, it's not even a cyrpto exclusive concept).
As for why I don't have faith in core, it's my opinion, as formed by watching interviews with and reading about almost everyone involved with Bitcoin on a high level.
Also, they've literally said in black and white that Blockstream is funded by off-chain scaling solutions. Does that not sound like a conflict of interest do you?
If we're going to be shitty and patronizing to each other, "Do you understand the concept of 'conflict of interest'?"
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:59:48
Well yes, and "electronic cash" what Bitcoin *supposedly* is.
As for digital gold, well gold's rarity is not just defined by the fact that it's hard to find in the ground, but also that you cannot create another atom that has all the properties of gold and insert it into the periodic table. Not true with OSS. Any entity—government, country, town, pair of friends—can create a Bitcoin clone that works just as well as Bitcoin as a storage of value (i.e. who owes who what).
That factor would also also not be changed by removal of the cap and mining rewards that ensure an inflation rate of 0. In fact one could argue (as I do in the mortgage example) that high deflation levels also make for a shitty store of value because the value is *still* changing. If that value is negative, it expands horribly in the wrong direction for the lendee.
Again, Bitcoin *cannot* be just a store of value or "digital gold." It *must* become a useful currency and for that to happen steps will have to be made to stabilize the price.
If that happens, I'm sure we'll get to the moon eventually. If not, the rocket is going to explode in the stratosphere.
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:39:30
Fine. I'm sure there's some who use it because they saw others but that's literally exactly the point. They're using it because others tried to distract from the fact that Bitcoin Cash more accurately reflects the "original" Bitcoin.

Yup, true, but as for the original statement that this could simply be changed with a soft fork is completely wrong. Also that a satoshi is merely a cosmetic division of a Bitcoin unit. (Side note: are these the same people who have been vehemently fighting a holy war over other Bitcoin technical issues? Yikes.)
Not sure I understand your second statement though: By the time 1 BTC is $1m, then satoshis will absolutely start to matter. Pennies get more and more worthless because of inflation but Bitcoin is insanely deflationary meanings pennies/satoshis are *the* future of Bitcoin.


I'm willing to bet you it absolutely would cause contention. Especially because people are so attached to the idea of hard caps and clearly don't understand anything about what value a bitcoin or satoshi actually is storing. I'd also say a capacity increase was a pretty necessary upgrade years ago and we all know how that went. ¬_¬

Couple of years.
Interestingly enough, one of the neat things about Bitcoin is that "the thing that gives it value" is different for different people, from the practical, to the idealistic, to sort-of-misguided.
Also, one man's attack is another man's attempt to implement a stop-gap scaling solution. To many people low fees and fast transactions are literally the only thing that matters.
Bitcoin absolutely *must* change and evolve in the long term in order to not be replaced by other systems which do a better job of meeting the world population's complex and varied needs. Not just libertarian crypo anarchist cypher punks.
Finally, when talking Bitcoin in the realosphere, I have heard either complete ambivalence or general distrust of core devs. But my opinion of competence is based primarily my own opinion formed by books, videos, etc., not other people's opinions.

Yeah no kidding. Even if people went to Bitcoin.com it’s not an exchange so they wouldn’t buy there. Many exchanges don’t even offer BCH but if they do, 9/10 people are going to see it and google “is BCH the same as BTC” or “btc bch difference” before dropping hundreds on crypto.  Even then it’s more likely that people google “how to buy bitcoin” and get Coinbase or something.
OP is so full of shit it hurts. The much more likely reason for the BCH spike is a hedge against the segwit2x drama.

Have you read the white paper?
He explicitly cites Moore's Law as justification that storage should be a non issue:


He also states on the forums that such an upgrade should be done **long in advance**:


@_date: 2017-11-18 15:55:34
Well, I was going to say "You're clearly not a computer scientist" but then changed my mind because I'm really annoyed by other people on Reddit making assumptions about me. "Fuck, maybe he *has* read the code, which I admittedly, have not, even though I know how to program in several languages."
But since you asked:
In programming (most languages) variables have different types. Two of the most basic are an `int` which is short for integer (whole number) and a `float` meaning a decimal number.
Doing math with floating point values (decimals) is generally poor practice. This is because it tends to have errors in it. Two examples:
1. I learned this myself while making a basic budget app as a teenager. When working with money, you always do all calculations on cents (or tenths of cents, etc.) keeping track of the value as a whole number. Thus, you don't do €4.51 + €1.78, you do: `451+178`and then display the resulting `629` as `€6.29`. Another example is that you add `4.5` and `3.5` and then get `9.0` and then want 10% so you divide by 10, expecting to get `0.9` but instead get `0.899999999999999999`
2. I had a lecture in my digital manufacturing class about a proposed change in 3D printing to use voxelized formats instead of typical .STL files since slicing an .STL file with vertices recorded in space as floating point numbers tended to introduce rounding errors in the print. Using tiny voxels (volumetric pixels) means that you were never working with amounts smaller than `1`.
This is essentially the entire reason the unit of Satoshi's actually exists. Since having a single bitcoin be your base unit which you don't divide would really suck, then it *would* be impossible to transfer any amount less than 1 BTC. So instead Nakamoto had to pick a smaller base unit which wallets actually send (and which fees are calculated with) and figured 1/10000000 should be enough.
Since you cannot divide a integer number of satoshis into a float number without inducing errors, this means you need to keep the smallest possible amount still `1` and increase the largest amount, again, making a cosmetic change such that anyone who held 1 BTC of the 21m capped coin now holds 10 BTC of the 210m capped coin.
Long story short: you absolutely cannot just add decimals to the smallest place. That's not how programming works.
@_date: 2017-11-09 10:30:19
Awwwwwww yissssssssss.
@_date: 2017-11-19 11:25:33


Yes, see my other comments where I explain this.


No, like I said, it's not at all likely. The reason I point it out is because multiplying everyone's balance by 10 as well as the hardcap by 10 is, programmatically, the only way to add another decimal place. Since a satoshi cannot be made smaller, you must make Bitcoins smaller and give everyone more of them. Then a Satoshi becomes nine decimal places of a Bitcoin.

You thought right, "virtually infinitely divisible" would be more correct since it can be divided into very very very very very small denominations (compared to most fiat which is divided into 100ths or 1000ths at most). But technically no, it's not infinitely divisible.

Yeah I don't disagree with you on most of this. Only two remarks:
As for better investment it just depends what you're after. When I go to my bank and look at what kind of packages they offer they rate them on a scale of low risk low reward to high risk high reward. If you're the kind of person who goes for for the latter than cyrpto currencies are absolutely "good" for you.


That's actually what I mean. I don't think fees are a sustainable way to incentivize mining and we'd all prefer Bitcoin to just have low or zero fees. That's one of its main original value propositions which appeals to the average user on a daily basis. Instead, the value proposition that it has a hard limit is not helpful to its adoption or utility or network sustainability and mostly just serves to give libertarians a hard on. My proposal would be to continue giving block rewards forever, even if just 1 BTC. If Bitcoin becomes globally adopted and in demand even a single BTC will be a massive reward and will only inflate the currency by 0.2% per year.
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:44:32
Idiot. How did you lose everything in one dip?
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:13:11
I'm not sure about that. "Willing to lose" is always a weird term in my opinion. Frankly, I'm not really willing to lose anything more than €50. Nor am I willing to lose €500 or €5000. Granted €50 is the same as going out for dinner with my girlfriend, so it's not like it's going to bankrupt me, but I still don't like losing it.
The thing is you have to acknowledge that you're still holding Bitcoin. If the price dips you haven't "lost" that money (fiat), just as you haven't "made" it if the Bitcoin price goes up but you don't sell.
I'm not willing to *lose* €50 for no good reason, but I am okay to *spend* €50 to go out to a restaurant on a Tuesday for no good reason.
Likewise, I'm not willing to *lose* €50 on crypto but I am willing to *spend* €50 on crypto because I believe in it.

There are a lot of problems with central banking but the inflation rate is not one of them. There's a huge difference between 2.2% and something like 900% in Venezuela.
Even if it was a problem, you could still design a system which ensures 0% inflation instead of massive deflation which makes a currency pretty much as non-functional as 900% inflation.
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:40:26
A. This isn't about "logic."
B. It's hardly reckless. It's taking the benefit of the existing BCH protocol in a very scaled back and safe form (2 mb is not very dramatic) and applying it to the existing BTC + Segwit protocol. It's a compromise and an attempt to create a much-needed stop-gap. Not evil, and not reckless. Meanwhile, where exactly is the lightning network? And when can we expect it? Will it work as well as those with a financial interest in its adoption promise? Oh, no one knows.

I’m wasn’t a fan of S2X so I’m happy at tonight’s news but I think anyone praising how this drama actually highlights bitcoins genius is full of it.
“Turns our that Bitcoin works exactly as designed: attempt to upgrade capacity and utility defeated by ideological zealots spreading misinformation. What a time to be alive.”
Bitcoins still needs scaling solutions and since the core devs don’t exactly convey competence and the lightning network is far from ready to fix anything, I think people calling dogma and infighting a success that validates some libertarian wet dream need to seriously rethink if they actually have Bitcoins best interests at heart.
@_date: 2017-11-18 15:17:30
It's true that any code is hypothetically malleable but I think maybe you don't really understand the limitations of the smallest unit. If it was needed a better choice would be to increase top cap (21m BTC) so as to not try and use a float value instead of an int value as the base unit of transactions.
Possible? Yes. Easy and likely? Not at all.

If you buy at Coinbase, you can do it now, because if your wallet arrives on the 18th, they will credit you BTC and B2X on the 16th. So you're ready for whatever happens. On other exchanges which have not made their position re: the fork clear, I would not risk it.
Another situation is to install a software wallet like Electrum and buy now wherever you like, send it there, and move to your hardware wallet post-fork.
Whether the price is right is another question, I imagine it's going to swing wildly, but overall downwards, right before and after the fork. One of those dips might be a better time to buy (although I'm not psychic and this is not investment advice).

Sure, it will change over time, but that's no different than printing fiat. It's possible that if the additional fiat actually improves its issuer's economy, its value rises against other fiat currencies.
Things in real life are not this clear cut but let's do a thought experiment: suppose a coin, we'll call it Iancoin, splits. Everyone who has Iancoin owns 1 IAN. Each split is identical and everyone likes them. Luckily both have widespread adoption and all merchants take Iancoin Unlimited (INU) and Iancoin Classic (INC). There is now 2x as much crypto in that eco system and each Iancoin (now INC) which was formerly worth $Moon is now worth $Moon/2 as is each INU.
Granted in the real world it's not this clear-cut and probably INU is less used and Coinbase said it's a BS thought experiment coin and didn't credit it to their users so it ultimately dies 5 minutes after the fork.
BUT... at the moment of split there is some value created there. And it's nice that you bring up Bitcoin Copper (where are you splitting from? I gotta claim mine and dump it) because I think we can all agree that's exactly what Bitcoin Gold was. An attempt to just "print" some more Bitcoin.

It's based on an assumption that less people will be able to run a full node because their hard drive will be full and therefore it will become centralized (i.e. payments have to go through central payment processors instead of peer-to-peer).
There's a lot wrong with this idea. I'll lay some points out:
- It's actually all an assumption. There isn't some hard proof so everyone has to first amend "it will" to "it *may*."
- The argument that because something is "harder" to do fewer people will do it can be applied to anything. The argument can be turned right around to say that setting up a lightning hub is hard and fewer people will do it and therefore it will be more centralized.
- So the question is "well, what's harder?" Storage is cheap and relatively easy to upgrade. Even my 60+ year old parents can do it.
- Bonus point: ["Hubs" are literally have centralization in their definition.](

...€600+. That's right, just for people to tap their bank cards. Oh me oh my I wouldn't want to also have to spend €50 on an external hard drive so I can accept Bitcoin too.
And after I spent months remodeling the interior and painting and stuff... ain't nobody got time to do the initial download of the blockchain?

@_date: 2017-09-28 15:53:07
No one really knows right now. But if you assume a block is 16mb (it's around 12mb right now I think) and produced every 10 minutes (that's the goal) then the block chain grows by 100mb every hour. This doesn't account for the fact that old blocks can be compressed though. Even without compression that's 2.4 GB per day which means you'd need a new 1 TB external HDD every 14 months or so. With compression, significantly less often than that.
This assumes that these variables stay constant though. If the blocks were way bigger, this would change.
It sounds like a lot the point is storage only gets cheaper and cheaper each year. Of course this would mean you can't run a full node on a Raspberry Pi but that's a strange requirement IMO. For now, any consumer machine with an external HDD can run a full node.
And storage just keeps getting cheaper and cheaper and smaller and smaller! 1 TB drives used to be called data centers, now I have 2 in my backpack.

@_date: 2017-10-31 11:44:21
In theory they'll be funded by fees but there's all sorts of possibilities. 
Bitcoin doesn't technically need dedicated miners though. The system was designed to work on everyone's computer, and in fact it did. The reason mining became a business was because GPU mining and eventually ASIC mining increased the likelihood of snagging a block reward. If all the miners left tomorrow we could just all just run our full nodes at home, and who knows, maybe you or I would get the block reward instead.

They are, but the point is they're essentially brute forcing the problem. Guessing until they get it right. They're searching for a special sequence of numbers starting with a certain number of 0s. When there are more 0s required, it becomes harder and harder to guess the right answer (so going from 0?????????... as a correct answer to 0000??????... as a correct answer). This is the difficulty adjustment.
Since gaming metaphors are in right now, let's say you and your buddies are all searching for the next block in a chest. The more friends you have on the server helping find and open every chest you can, the odds of finding it get tougher. If it's just you searching, the game relaxes and improves your odds so it doesn't take you days to find.
**Edit:** As an addition, since people often make it sound like the "cryptographic puzzle" is something that a super computer works as hard as it can to solve and miraculously comes up with answer for, it's worth noting finding possible answers is not that hard. Everyone's computer can do it in a faction of a second, and indeed, that is how Bitcoin started. But because of the 0s requirement they don't solve the larger requirement. So computers which are specially optimized for just this puzzle can do it a bajillion times faster and make more guesses per second, increasing the chance they are first to come up with an answer that solves the 0s requirement described above.
Again, to put this in terms of an RPG, mining hardware is like a character with no weapons, no attack, and very little health, BUT, he can teleport from chest to chest without searching the level/world allowing him far more chances per minute to get the prize.

Ok, because anyone can create a fork of a coin and get some cash from it (see Bitcoin Gold lately). In theory we could just keep forking the Bitcoin software every time we need another 21 million coins.
But, again, the reason people don't have a problem with this is that there will always be some rules for how the new dough is distributed.
Whether or not BCH and BTC are worth the same as nothing to do with it. BCH is actually a perfect example of how we've created more imaginary money out of nothing but people's believes that one set of code is better than the other. Point is, that's OK with cryptocurrencies.

I get the principle behind this but it doesn't appear to be a significant issue right now and as the block chain grows, so does people's internet speed.

In effect, nothing, but the reason people here prefer it is because the *amount* which can be issued is controlled by code. You don't have to trust anyone to do it properly. And no one can bail out miners if they don't get the block rewards they were hoping for, as can be done with banks.

Because there's a disagreement about the protocol. Mid November a new version of bitcoin (the segwit2x everyone is talking about) will start to be used. It's not compatible with the old protocol (ie a hard fork).
So if more than 50% are using this new protocol, it is now the "real" Bitcoin and if it fails to get adoption then the old protocol will remain the "real" bitcoin.

That's pretty silly. Unless you're a hermit to who lives in isolation, "simply avoid people who X" is pretty much impossible. I can say I've seen the statistics and a gun in my home is much more likely to injur or kill me, my family or my friends, than any would-be criminal. But, can I go to movie theaters where they don't sell tickets to gun owners so I don't have to worry about being shot up? Can I move my kids to a different school where none of the students' families own guns so one never comes in in a backpack? Of course not. As I said I don't really have an issue with people owning a hunting rifle but other classes of guns should by all means be controlled.

As a Dutchie, this has tulpen written all over it, but... but...
1. Tulips reached a price of about €1,000,000, which is indeed fucking crazy and €2055.314 at time of writing is not that close.
2. Unlike Bitcoin, tulips have an infinite supply.
3. Tulips when stored for a year die and turn to brown goo and do not appreciate value, unlike bitcoin.
4. Although the idea of this huge devastating bubble is the conventionally accepted story, there isn't that much hard data to support that it ever happened.

Splitting is not the same as making more. You can't make 1 btc worth twice as much by sending 0.5 btc to another wallet.
As for the supply, 21 mil is the cap of btc. Tulips are infinite and it's always possible to grow more. AND as icing, tulips don't become progressively harder to grow over time.

Well the thing that amazes me is that the U.S. seems so stuck "all-or-nothing" solutions. There is the possibility for both guns and drugs to be legal but heavily regulated.
For example, in the Netherlands, as everyone knows, "weed is legal" which means 5 g per person and smoking it recreationally is legal. Carrying around 1 kilo of cocaine is not.
It should be possible to do something similar with guns where buying a hunting rifle for recreational use is legal, with a mental health check, but buying semi-automatic or automatic weapons (which are designed for killing other people, not hunting) are controlled.
In both cases the answer is never either a ban or a free-for-all but instead some thoughtful compromise.

Well OP just said 384,400 without units so I chose to believe he was refering to €. Which also hit the sort of landmarky number of €1800 today. Not as round as $2000 but still round to the nearest 100.
Of course, OP also meant 384.400 I think. :P In Europe the , is used for decimal places (like € 9,99).
So I'd vote for either 1 btc = € 384.400,00 or 1 btc = $ 238,855.09 (in mi)

Other currencies don't matter so long as people want and accept Bitcoin. This is no different than any other monetary system.
For example, suppose I ask you do a job for me. Maybe mow my lawn. And I'll pay you for it in IanBucks. IanBucks are fairly easy to mint, anyone can write "Ian is so cool that this paper is now worth 1 IanBuck." on a scrap of paper to make one.
So do you want to get paid in IanBucks? Of course not. No one else does either. They're worthless because they can be produced so easily.
Anyone can fork Bitcoin and make their own currency but it will also be worth nothing until it reaches a critical mass of users and utility. And if there's already plenty of crypto on the market, this is harder and harder to do. Bitcoin was created because there was a need for cryptocurrency. But that need has been well satisfied already and every subsequent attempt to make a new crypto coin will really need to give it some other utility in order to make it worth anything to anyone. Otherwise they might as well be IanBucks.
P.S. IanBucks are a real thing. I will sell you an envelope of 1000 IanBucks for 1 BTC.

I'm this guy a bit. I had been following bitcoin since beginning of the year and noticed a few days ago it hit €1500 and decided to register at Kraken and set up a purchase order so that in a few hours when it dipped back to that price, I'd buy. Never did. Changed my order to €1550. Never did. Finally said, "OK I blew it. 1600." Hasn't gone down to that yet. Finally finally said, "OK. Forget buy orders at lower prices. Just buying now at 1734."
So far, a solid 3-4% return which is already better than that money sitting in my savings account.
Also, I hate myself because... mm... around 2014 when I was in college, some friends and I were thinking of starting a business. One of the ideas we considered was bitcoin mining but at the time it was looking like bitcoin was slowly depreciating value and we had no idea if it would recover to it's 2013 highs so we didn't go with that idea.
If only we had...

So pick a different date then. Or rather, pick a starting date and timeline.
For example say we take the price on July 5.
If the price on August 5 is more than 30% lower than the price on July 5, wins and gets $2000 of BTC (@ Aug. 5 price) from If the price on August 5 is less than 30% lower than the price on July 5, wins and gets $2000 of BTC (@ Aug. 5 price) from Side note: I'm in Cuba with no internet access from July 21 to August 5 which I think in the world of Bitcoin is kind of a terrible time to not be able to buy or sell.

In my mind that's when it will start to be used more for small transactions.
For example, the main food delivery company in the Netherlands accepts bitcoin. So I can order a pizza for €10, which is about 0.004 BTC right now. But while I expect 0.004's value to be the same in an hour, and astronomically higher in a few years, the pizza's value will be low in 30 minutes when it's cold or nonexistent after I ate it.
In that sense it's a pretty terrible trade.
Compared to €10 fiat which if I leave under the couch for a year will still be worth pretty much the same as it is now, and I'm hungry. So fuck it, then I'll go for the pizza.

I think this kind of shows you don't fundamentally understand that terrorism is not something that war can be waged on in a conventional fashion. I get the Nazi ideology point and I've even made similar points in the same context, but they're very different situations. The type of conflict is completely different. This is not two countries fighting each other with organized militaries. Also, Britain made huge sacrifices when I think people would be unwilling to make now like sending away all the children to the countryside.
But... but... it's kind of moot because you just made my point for me: Condemning Naziism, and arresting badbrit would not have stopped the bombs from falling. Or to use a similar time frame but different place: rounding up all the Japanese people on the west coast and putting them in concentration camps did fuck-all to avoid war with Japan.
Unlike these examples though where it's nation vs nation fighting across borders, there isn't a clear solution. I don't have the solution. No one does.
And rather than admit that and start trying different approaches like making sure children from a young age and foreign background feel integrated in society as they grow up instead of sidelined, people like Le Pen give these sure-to-do-nothing-or-make-things-worse solutions.

I think he means that if everyone was so hot for segwit2x the growing consensus (to not confuse with EC) would drive the price way up.
To my mind though, by that logic (and I don't really know if that logic is any good), that would mean that if no one liked segwit2x the consensus would drive the price down. Instead, it's fairly stable and growing slightly which would suggest everyone is a bit "ehhhh ok" but also a bit of "well, let's do this."

I wouldn't say its a problem with socialist countries. Life is pretty great and we have multiple political parties so you don't have to choose the lesser of two evils and can vote for, say, the pirate party.
Also, I am speaking for NL here, you have to declare your crypto holdings but that's kind of meaningless because a. unless you always use the same address no one knows its you and b. the value in EUR depends who you ask. Yet on the flip side you get all the benefits bitcoin being seen as legitimate currency.
This legislation sounds, to me, like typical conservative BS. Just a hopeless and benefits-no-one rejection of technological progress.

I think because many people feel the whole point (or at least a primary point) of BTC was the idea that it would be universal cash, accepted everywhere, in every country. Despite differences "under the hood" it would mean we're back to a system where a place might say, "Sorry we only accept ETH" and then I have to either keep a store of each crypto on hand, like keeping some USD, JPY, EUR, etc. in a safe, or come up with someone who's going to do the exchange on the fly for you like PayPal does now.

Talking shit about racial and religious minorities is not the same as opposing terrorism. In fact it tends to directly contribute to it.
Like, imagine terrorism is actually a fist fight. And some guy just sucker punched you. And you then "oppose" it by saying, "Hey fuck you, you piece of shit! You don't belong here! Go home!" Do you think:
A. He will stop hitting you? or,
B: Dial it up to 11?

**This part is my basic understanding, people who are more knowledgable, please correct if necessary:**
Essentially a fork is when two different versions of the Bitcoin software is in use. A hard fork is when the two versions are not compatible, and a soft fork is when they are compatible. In blockchain this means actually a literal fork where the chain splits off into two. In the case of a soft fork though, they'd rejoin later down the line.
**This part is pretty obvious though to anyone reading around Twitter and Reddit and I don't think needs correcting:**
The community is highly divided about what the future of Bitcoin looks like and no matter what does happen on August 1st a lot of people are going to be unhappy, cash out, and drive the price down. How much no one knows. But it's fairly safe to guess it will be significant. Personally, I've already decided not to buy anymore until August.
