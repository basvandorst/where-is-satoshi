It means the currency is being used and an asset. Not a means of purchase based on buying a house/food ect as just stated. Currency essentially is still a medium of exchange, I agree... but it's also used for other purposes because other medium of exchange exist

They have to hold the currency to exchange it

I disagree, even tho EFT is ultimately meaningless to the long term objectives of bitcoin. It's helps to catapult it into into the mainstream.... Which then makes SEC redundant

I fully agree with this.
It's such a contrast to see people only speaking about price here while on r/Litecoin the conversation is very much about merchant adoption
@_date: 2018-08-17 08:44:58
It's good for those who are confortsble screwed over by the finance sector and don't want to take responsibility for their own wealth, and it's good for everyone who prefers decentralised markets because it means adoption will happen quicker
I see no downside

Nothing stopping someone making their own keys and putting all the bitcoin into it. 
Just as their is nothing stopping people emptying their banks and putting everything in their wallet. 
The thing is, their for the illiterate their is more security in central systems, however centralised systems should come at the detriment of individuals who can manage their own wallet safely

To be fair, it's probably not best everyone owning their own keys; their are too many computer illiterate people for it to happen in the short term. 
Let's make it so idiots can use bitcoin but that future gens are brought up educated enough to know to have their own keys

Bitcoin is driven of being a brand name almost synonymous with blockchain.  Its rise, is the rise of blockchain. It also doesn't need to be proprietary to hold value. 
It's like argueing that Wikipedia doesn't hold any value
@_date: 2019-08-02 19:38:19
Remember markets generally settle at around 5 major players
Bitcoin isnt mainstream until its dominance hits around 25%

Certainty is impossible, but you can work to confidence levels with larger data sets. With only 4 points even a low confidence level is putting the price anywhere between minus infiitiny and infinity

Most western governments are running enterprise blockchains. I know the UK land registry and department not work in pensions is trialing them. As are many other countries governments.
They may be "costly to run" compared to normal databases. However the cost of these services is much more in the human overheads and misappropriation of funds

After a certain point would the dollar price not just enter freefall and become irrelevant as bitcoin becomes dominant?
@_date: 2018-11-21 20:48:59
So, there was more demand from institutions then expected so they are delaying.... 
And the market reacts by panic selling. ��
@_date: 2018-11-29 13:25:51
Immediately I doubt it will be an issue, not everyone buying coffee will use bitcoin from day one

economists don't predict the future; they generally analyse the past.  
They can't predict without data; of which they have very little

Real adoption comes with institutional money
Until everyone uses bitcoin to store their pension it's not adopted.

Could be a combination of a handful of global currencies. 
It would be silly to assume there would only be one global coin; when through history we see markets settle at around 4/5 major players. 
There always needs to be some level of competition

Are we sure... Last time a shit bag countries leader shut down the internet we found out the NSA has a buggy hack
@_date: 2019-01-23 08:41:28
So... I assume by 2014 everyone will be using bitcoin ��
@_date: 2019-01-29 18:07:15
Think that's the issue, bitcoin can't without lightening for scaling, and although even tho bitcoin is a great store of wealth it's not the only use case for blockchain
The other side point on this is that bitcoin purity will not and should not happen
If their is only one decentralised network. That network is  overtly centralised.  There needs to be competition 
@_date: 2019-01-29 20:00:34
Markets without competition are monopolies, you can't have a decentralised monopoly, the level of corrosion and risk by centralised management means a fork would be innevitable
In not suggesting which projects are the future, or where they stem from. However a handful of crypto currencies that communicate on layer 2/3 technologies is much more likely as that's how markets generally settle

It's the ICE (owner of the NYSE) hedging
@_date: 2019-09-14 08:31:39
Yes.. It doesnt go well..
@_date: 2018-07-03 05:15:19
If there was zero demand the price would reflect that , 
@_date: 2019-09-03 14:28:45
That's never happened in a single market ever. As paper money become dominant the number of currencies scaled and consolidated into about 5 major players 
This happens market after market after market. Its nonsense to think that bitcoin should have no competition, and it would be worrying and dangerous to have zero competition 
So if there was only crypto, I'd fork the dev just for the balance of development power as it would be centralised if not
@_date: 2018-07-29 15:06:51
Why would you sell? Sell for what? ��
HODL.. then just spend. There is not sell anywhere in this process
@_date: 2019-09-03 14:59:09
Yes it.doesnt have any competition
So it's not a mature market then ��
If you only have a single decentralised currency you only have decentralised fees not decentralised currency.

The 5 main market things doeant stop at countries and has nothing to do with law
Natural markets settle in that way because markets competition is essential for the market place to not be authoritarian 
If we only have bitcoin that essentially becomes centralised currency not decentralised as it means bitcoin core team have authoritative control. If they dont then as soon as a controversial decision is made the chain would fork which would be a natural market progression
Bitcoin maxamalist need to get a grip, we need more than one blockchain for true freedom

Bitcoin isnt dominant till its crypto dominance hits 25% 
High market dominance just means we still have a long way till market maturity.. onwards and upwards
@_date: 2019-09-28 08:56:14
Your point would be fair enough if the banks were putting the money in a vault. But they dont they put the money into investments or lend it to people at high interests with a risk they will never see that money again

I thought it was about not having centralised institutions destroy your wealth by printing money and handing the newly created money to people who don't have societies best interest at heart

How do you think you show exponential change over time?
