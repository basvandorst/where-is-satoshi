Can the sender just split it through many  $5,400 transactions on different addresses?  Or does a donor have to supply his identity in order for a politician to accept a donation under $5,400?

Are you talking about Snapchat stock?

Funny how it's "why are they choosing exchanges for me" when it really is "why won't they let me force them to deal with who I want them to" and whine about it.

OK, thank you.  I was hoping for a clearly defined specification instead of just randomly peppered across that document.  
@_date: 2018-06-07 18:29:57
But how do I get random people to add funds on their side of the channel so I can become a usable part of the network?  If nobody does that, my node is worthless for the network.

Both LND and c-lightning is awesome!  (Please, don't add in the other one that frequently gets mentioned as it is not that good.)

When she makes a super suit that can make me fly and shoot missiles, I'll pay for it with many micro-payments over lightning!

The point is not about 'the Chinese' particularly, it's about handing over the keys to everything via 51%.

If only there was a better wallet out there.  Please, LND, make an open source, good quality, Lightning wallet!
@_date: 2018-06-26 18:13:06
Don't use ACINQ, they have the worst node implementation out there, by far.  Use LND or c-lightning instead.
@_date: 2018-06-08 02:32:29
Awesome, I did not know that.  Thank you for enlightening me!
@_date: 2018-06-21 00:52:54
Will you set funds on your side of the channel, too, or just here leeching from us?
P.S. Switch off of Eclair to a better node implementation and then I'll think about it.

Fraud and deception is what keeps BCH afloat as an alt-coin.  It's pathetic and sad, really.
@_date: 2018-06-27 15:30:57
Any verification that it is real?  How do we know it's not a false flag which BCH will then point to 'prove' how secure it is?  We all know how dishonest they are to begin with and how stupid the media is on things such as this.

I know someone who made $100,000 on a years worth of work!

Doesn't matter if it's shells.  The point remains the same.

I know a lot about bitcoin but never went to the Wikipedia page.  Quite the presumptuous title, don't you think?
@_date: 2018-06-29 15:45:46
"I demand that you forward BTC to a specific address for me.  If you say no for what ever reason, I whine.  You should should simply be my bitch and do whatever I want or I'll cry to reddit about it!" -OP, and apparently you too.
@_date: 2018-06-27 15:20:55
Oh, about 100 blocks.
@_date: 2018-06-07 18:31:43
So I just 'exist' and magically people will dedicate their money to connect to me and open up channels with my node?  I'm not understanding how to actively become a useful part of the network.
@_date: 2018-06-28 19:20:44
Really, you trust one entity that is rather anti-cryptocurrency and with the track record they have (not just limited to crypo)?  I mean, it's easy to take a cheap jab at the EU and US, but this is many people's lives, not to mention a possible enhancement to mankind on the line if it plays out in the right way.

Funny how the CEO's gender somehow takes credit for an entire team.  Why even mention gender?  What does that have to do about lightning, block-chain, technology?  She helps guide **a team** that does the work.  But you know, gender.

Trading!?  More like tarding.  HODLLLLLL!!!!!
@_date: 2018-07-07 03:14:18
I sorry for your loss of BTC.
@_date: 2018-07-01 15:07:25
Title is a little deceptive.  Another party did an on-chain TX to get the funds onto lightning.
Need to send them bitcoin to send to your lightning channel?  Do an on chain tx.
