I think the general gist of all the above is 'don't worry'! As long as you have 1 more BTC in your wallet (than you are sending) then it should be fairly quick... If you get what I mean?

Thanks for taking the time to air your thoughts.
It's a large topic that can be debated in many ways... 
I just hope for liberties sake that it does become a success. 
We (the people) need something other than a fiat currency, as that system has become too corrupted. The coming derivatives collapse may promote this virgin monetary system into the limelight it needs.

Giganews, VyperVPN and Mimo - are excellent. There are rumors of them taking Bitcoin in 2013. No user based indexing and quality score though. Just a Mimo &amp; USENET search tool built in. Surely the NZB matrix type of indexing DB can be anonymously provided externally?
@_date: 2012-12-09 20:36:08
Are these guys for real? You can't even put that system in the same category as Bitcoin! Why even mention Bitcoin in the article? This is just a form of lending and borrowing, there is nothing P2P about it!
@_date: 2012-12-11 07:42:24
15% is an average rate here...
You don't understand what I am saying because you need to peel off a few more layers... I'll put it like this... "Lenders are no longer in the 'risk business'..." Does that help?
@_date: 2012-12-09 10:09:29
The way I see it is simple. Two types of loans exist... 
In the first, the interest is created by taking a portion of the profit from an IDEA... Nothing of value exists until BOTH the idea begins to work and enough profit is realised. 
In the second, the interest is created from the sale of assets. This sale is necessary because an IDEA did not work and therefore an alternative source is necessary to realise the profit.
Either way, the loan industry is based on fantasy... I think it's extremely greedy and immoral to charge 15% APR (with no fallback) against such an uncontrollable variable!

Please test the services with small amounts first. I can't emphasise enough about dealing with 'companies' who do not even provide an address or contact number.

Thinking outside the box on this one... Skill motivated gamers would sureIy be more enticed if they had more to lose? I imagine that it is commonplace for gamers to pay $40+ for a game that ends up at the back of the drawer? I believe nothing gives you a more adrenaline charged fear factor than the thought of loosing something tangible (well maybe your life - hence why permadeth has an appeal to hardened gamers.)

It's only really anonymous if the transactions take place in the 'world of Bitcoin'. As soon as you convert large amounts to normal fiat currency, there is a distinct trail.

I think 'food' should be split down into a few more distinct categories... Raw Ingredients (wheat, veg etc) and Production Food (bread, ready meals etc) I don't know the correct terminology but I can't see the latter selling for Bitcoin unless the first does. This tends to be the case for most 'manufactured products' (ie. paying for the raw materials). I suppose therefore, the SOURCE adopting BTC is crucial for anything to be a viable concept. Unless of course the owner(s) of the 'production business' are advocates of BTC and are willing to do more work.

Sounds like you're missing the point about Bitcoin - % interest and BTC don't go together very well.

@_date: 2012-12-17 16:18:43
Greedy Banks aren't supporting businesses or entrepreneurship. They want to control the flow of money and are too selective in who they help.
I run a business and Bitcoins save us heaps in transaction costs. Overall, it also has a much better 'interest rate'. Bitcoin gives us more control because in essence WE ARE THE BANK!
For more of Bitcoins future potential please watch this...

Well then Bitcoin is in competition with fiat currencies and we need Bitcoin to succeed. So I suggest the Bitcoin community read up on the FinCEN legislation. We don't want to loose our exchange facilities to banking corporations or the appeal of Bitcoin will be reduced and effect the rate of exchange.
@_date: 2013-03-26 10:42:54
Just because I highlight an issue and make a prediction, doesn't mean I'm in favor of it! 
The Bitcoin community needs to be aware of the FinCEN issue, so it can hopefully prevent it. I'm all in favour of Bitcoin, I'm just being the 'Devils Advocate'.

If you could only buy your coins from one exchange, what are the chances of it becoming mainstream?

1. The Math: More Bitcoin adopters = BTC price increase.
2. Where is the incentive for people to convert FIAT to BTC?
@_date: 2013-03-26 14:09:39
I agree with you about it being resistant, however the FinCEN issue needs addressing by the Bitcoin community or adoption by users and commercial institutions will fall. We need Bitcoin to succeed... 
I was perhaps sensationalizing my post title in order to gain more readership, however the threat to exchanges is very real!

To profit mainly. But it's also good for gaining free marketing. I.e increasing SEO effectiveness via external Bitcoin links and more...
Merchants should definitely care. By promoting Bitcoin only 'loss leaders', they will ultimately make more money in the long run...
The end result is that more people make a transition into the 'World of Bitcoin'. Thereby improving BTC's overall worthiness and making their own holdings of Bitcoin increase in value exponentially. 
I am quite sure that this long term strategy, would be considerably more profitable than the immediate minor gains from a standard resale markup.

The problem of buying a device pre-configured, is whether you trust the 'configurer'.

You think I haven't already done that? 
I'm struggling with the wallet and user statistics.

Maybe in America they associate credit with Amex or Visa credit cards. Credit is actually a positive term, so give credit where credits due.

With all of the **minus votes** for my Pro-Bitcoin post, I'm beginning to wonder myself LOL...
@_date: 2013-12-22 01:27:24
&lt;note to self&gt; Fuck recommending things you know will help. You'll only get down-voted and slagged off!

I think I've established that simple humour is fine. Don't post anything too complex or they attack with the downey's!

Technology isn't perfect yet. I don't think MtGox run from easy scaleable Amazon servers?

Mega.co.nz already accept Bitcoin. It's going to be better than Plopbox...

What OS do you use on your RPi? There are quite a few distros available. Google distrowatch - for a PC setup a really user friendly one is Pinguy.

'My argument'? I'm stating facts and making a prediction based on those facts. Pity you can't see the big picture.

This has been discussed in many many many posts and communities. Search or google+ or Bitcoin forum and then just jump in...
Do you own any Bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-12-04 19:34:08
You are referring to a minority of people who exist in all altcoin communities. Your over worrying is unfounded!
@_date: 2013-12-08 23:59:52
In the beginning, when there were no transactions to solve, where did the Bitcoins come from?
@_date: 2013-05-15 09:56:17
Bitcoin hasn't gone mainstream yet.

But it's not a coin and 'credit' is a positive term (see my other reply)
@_date: 2013-12-20 10:54:46
If Bitcoin is a commodity then the customer is receiving extra 'goods'. Why is everybody so keen to label Bitcoin as currency? There should be a new category bracket **'CURRODITY'**

Is it really too late?

I tuk em yesterday n now I relize Bitcoins a fuckin SCAMIN PONZI SCEME!
@_date: 2013-06-23 21:32:36
I've said all along 'coin' should be 'credit'... **Bitcredit**. Your key gives you **credit** not coins. Change the name and these issues will go away!

Because it's not helping. He should have notified everybody here beforehand.

Trying to keep it in context as not many people are aware of GEO/SDR. Also, I'm on my phone and lost the tab to the other URL. I was originally trying to post a .self rather than URL link... Dam phone!

Does Ripple also cater for fiat currencies?
@_date: 2013-12-22 11:08:52
It happened because of MS Windows and the inherent lacks system surrounding it. This person would benefit from Linux!

I've looked up and down these replies and I still can't see your solution or advice!

The Converting of fiat funds IN and OUT. It jeopardizes the take up rate and therefore looses it's appeal. Anybody handling $10k worth has to be tracked by FinCEN. Also the mining technology will be out of reach for 'Joe Public'. Mining will be commercialised and then FinCEN has em!
@_date: 2013-03-26 14:18:13
No but Amazon and other corporations wiped out DVD and CD media outlets! We are increasingly forced into purchasing how 'they want us to'. And it's all obviously monitored in a superior way! Just substitute Bitcoin for your local bookshop and you'll (roughly) get what I'm talking about.
@_date: 2013-03-26 10:19:42
They don't NEED to do those things... I'm all in favor of Bitcoin, however the appeal may be lost on Joe public if it is difficult to convert in and out of fiat due to FinCEN and the PATRIOT ACT!
@_date: 2013-03-19 20:10:28
Thanks... Fingers crossed
@_date: 2013-03-26 08:26:09
I agree. But those that 'see' are the 'powers that be' and unfortunately don't like Liberty.
@_date: 2013-05-15 08:25:44
Prepaid 'credit cards' exist... Just because the loan sharks (AMEX &amp; VISA etc) hijacked the term 'credit' doesn't mean we can't take it back... Also Bitdeb sounds too much like a Linux distro.

Just offering them a safer alternative OS than the weak one they are using now. What's your suggestion brainbox?
