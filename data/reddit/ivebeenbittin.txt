You can look what was your balance at this particular time looking into your card statement. I didn't refuse anything, do provide requested information to proceed, currently I even can't see the mentioned transaction in the system.

I never once said everything is ok you smart ass

I would like to believe that as I've also been with wirex for sometime now and I had to contact their customer support at least twice a month for various reasons but mostly for things going wrong on their end. The card has been declined in restaurants, shops, gas stations and cafes many times.. you use this card with one eye open hoping it doesn't embarrass you once again. Ive finally had enough of wirex and have since moved over to Shakepay with no dramas.  Thanks but that thread is from 2015, E-coin has been rebranded to Wirex now.

I have replied to their emails and everytime I have asked the same question.
What was my btc balance prior to your 'glitch' and before the .6btc was deposited. As of this moment my account still remains at zero!!!
@_date: 2017-01-18 02:12:40
Stay away from Wirex, just read the wirex reviews on social media to understand why. Go with a Shakepay bitcoin visa, youll fing them in the apps stores.

I have been blocked by the Facebook social media team from answering or commenting. I have replied to the emails as you refuse to answer my question publicly..
1. What was my btc account balance before it was deleted and replaced with the .6 btc deposit..
@_date: 2017-01-24 00:42:42
They are still refusing to answer my question or give me any information about my wirex bitcoin wallet prior to their Glitch. They know the deposit was a donation made by one of my 250+ clients as I stated in my original  letter to them. 
The truth is they don't know what my balance was and they refuse to acknowledge it so they just left my balance at zero. It's time to goto the police.
The sad thing is that this entire complaint was over .6btc and the remainder of my bitcoin balance in my wirex wallet.
@_date: 2017-01-10 11:14:46
Don't get me started.. I'm yet to post my emails to and from wirex/E-coin about the theft of my .6btc on the 31st. I have given multiple people access to my wirex account to see for themselves how much of a scam wirex/E-coin is. I have had BTC taken from my account without my consent and Wirex refuses to give it back. I'm still waiting to hear back from Micheal or Britain in wirex customer support about the theft of my entire bitcoin balance.
@_date: 2017-01-20 22:05:19
No support has not replied to me.. the €27.50 transaction and the .6btc .. did you read my comment.. 
I see you have blocked me on Facebook. I have all the screen shots uploaded for everyone to see.. Give back my bitcoin!!

wirex is a scam and a pack of liars as they do charge to load the card, over 4% commission is deducted.  I was a fully verified customer for close to 1 yr so I would know.. I cut the card up when they returned my btc balance to zero without refunding me. Read mine and many other reviews on Wirex in Reddit.
@_date: 2017-01-12 00:04:45
Wirex/E-coin is a scam. I have copied and pasted this here as I thought it was relevant. 
I have had enough of your support Ive given Brian at Wirex enough time to go through my account and rectify the "GLITCH" as he so kindly put it. But for the shits and giggles here are my support tickets.. 36942, 36988, 37264, 37168 &amp; 37184.. thats just this week. I have been a wirex fully verified customer for close to a year now and I have had nothing but problems on a weekly to fortnightly basis. But this time wirex has stolen from me and have stated in an Email to me that they suffered a "glitch on their server" thus causing my card and wirex wallet to misbehave. On the 31st I first noticed my account not letting me top up my card, oh great I thought, right on New years Eve.. fantastic !! contact customer care but knowing i wound not get a reply for at least 3 to 5 days (which is normal for wirex) the next problem I encountered was another transaction declined at a shop only to find out the transaction was indeed subtracted from my account(If you have a wirex account and this happens to you KEEP YOUR DECLINED SLIP !! AS THIS HAPPENS ALOT WITH THIS CARD), so another customer care ticket to wirex asking for them to stop the declined transaction of 27.50eur and then a confirmed deposit of 0.6btc goes into my account and erases my existing balance bringing my balance to exactly 0.6 bitcoin. Now i start to panic, now i can no load my card or transfer my account balance out !!
Please PM me for screen shots of every occurrence and transaction I mention here.
OK, so now I have a frozen account over new years eve with no means of gaining access to my Bitcoin !! stupid of me to rely on E-coin/Wirex .. Finally after 4 days of waiting I get an answer, " we had a Glitch in our system" sorry!! and removed the .6btc from my account leaving my balance a ZERO !! After yelling at them for days and threatening then to come into their office I get another response saying that the confirmed deposit was an old one and gave me a transaction ID of a transaction i made 8 month prior.. THERE IS NO WAY i CAN CHECK VIA THE BLOCKCHAIN EXPLORER AS THEY CHANGE THE WALLET ADDRESS AND ITS A DONATION DEPOSIT FROM ONE OF MY 255 CLIENTS. So, now I have an account that shows a .6btc confirmed deposit on the 31st of Dec but a ZERO account balance. Ive asked them to tell me what my balance was before the "GLITCH" but no one knows.. THIS IS THEFT!!
I HAVE A SCREEN SHOT SHOWING MY ACCOUNT BALANCE BEFORE THEIR "GLITCH", I HAVE ASKED WIREX TO TELL ME WHAT IT WAS OTHERWISE I WANT MY .6BTC REFUNDED PLUS THE COST OF MY TIME FOLLOWING THIS MATTER UP. 12 DAYS!!!

It's incredible to think a company such as wirex has gone so far on such terrible service. They have no respect when it comes to customer service, ive been told to "CHILL" "Be patient" " To Relax" all the time refusing to answer any of my questions.. it's like they are ignoring my questions on purpose hoping in time I will just go away.. this has been going on since the 31st of Dec 2016.

I have been blocked from Facebook from answering or commenting. I tild you in would take this matter publicly if you didn't stop giving me the run around.
Answer my question.
What was my btc account balance before the "glitch" and before the .6 btc was deposited. Because my account still remains at zero.

No one is answering my questions because they have no idea what my wirex  bitcoin wallet balance was before it was deleted after the glitch. If this doesn't get resolved soon I'm been advised to get a police report and go see a lawyer.. I'm done  wasting my time with wirex. 
The fact is wirex has deleted my btc balance and refuse to give it back. I have screen shots and verification emails sent to me by Wirex that state differently to what they are saying. The statement they sent me does not show my bitcoin balance of my wirex wallet. I have asked and asked for my bitcoin balance before the 'glitch' but they refuse to answer me.
