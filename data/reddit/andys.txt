The way Stripe implemented bitcoin (without segwit, lightning), etc.. it sucks for the small payments that is stripe's bread and butter

Down?  Don't you mean up?  fewer miners means mining profit shared amongst fewer.

Interesting mention of bitcoin at the bottom.

We're in a sad place right now when having such opinions in polite society makes you automatically sound crazy.

I'm only running mine in winter when we would be running heating anyway.

As part of my job I have visited many datacentres and they are all WAY bigger than any of the bitcoin mining facilities I've seen, and full of big, hot idling machines hosting crap you've never heard of or care about.

So you're saying .... spend all your USD because its gonna be worth less tomorrow?

You're saying running your own bank is easier?

I always interpreted the ATO Bitcoin thing as not applying to the actual value of the bitcoins.  Have been puzzled all this time why everyone has been insisting it applied when it should not.
@_date: 2017-01-25 20:54:44
Same with BTCC
@_date: 2016-11-24 22:14:50
Its called Stripe.

"very valuable hard drive space"? Is this a joke? i can't tell anymore
@_date: 2017-11-06 03:07:52
But you're paying way more for the actual transactions to be mined.  The hard drive cost is a pittance in comparison.
@_date: 2017-11-06 01:28:42
An extra 1TB of HDD space is a drop in the ocean compared to the rest of your node.  What are we talking, $20-25 USD now?

So when they next get hacked, all this new personal information will be uploaded to the internet, as well as losing your BTC!

Who is going to want to buy the bitcoins in Somalia that people are going to want to sell after transferring?

I bought 20kg of meat at honestbeef.com.au, waiting for delivery which should be in a few weeks.
@_date: 2012-01-10 01:50:06
This won't happen. Smarter people than you have worked out the numbers. (also, transaction fees will help to keep the number of frivilous transactions low).
@_date: 2012-01-11 06:01:35
If every transaction puts in 0.1 then even at only 10k transactions per day, there are probably enough BTC to make mining worthwhile.  But hopefully the number of transactions will increase...
@_date: 2012-02-24 00:31:58
The website has said "4-6 weeks" for many months now.

I've been using bitcoin for over 5 years and I definitely feel like there's a normal.  The same damn pattern has been repeating over and over.
(But experiencing a "normal" doesn't mean it will be normal forever.)

Isn't his brand pretty much "understanding doesn't scale, just invest broadly in the basics"
@_date: 2016-09-10 00:55:39
Wait.. what? You managed to sell without getting scammed/chargeback?  mind blown
@_date: 2017-10-10 03:47:54
its so hard to use it, its a PoS.  when i dumped mine there was hours until the next block. (then suddenly there were lots of blocks in a row).   Makes whatever issues i had with BTC seem like nothing.
@_date: 2018-02-08 02:00:21
Well you're probably still doing way better than folks that sold at previous 10x highs ( $100, $1000)
@_date: 2011-12-30 05:55:53
I think this is way more interesting than the current exchange rate.  Is it a consolidation of connected hosts?  Or a long term decline in number of users.
@_date: 2011-12-30 09:07:26
Would be cool if there was some way to correlate "down" nodes with wallet balances.  Could be miners who joined during the bubble, generated a few BTC, and were never really that interested in Bitcoin long term.
@_date: 2011-12-30 08:46:50
So you think this graph is closely linked to the mining hash rate graph?  The nodes leaving the network are just miners from the bubble?
@_date: 2011-05-21 23:59:29
Quite a few people can get electricity for free.  Leaving the computer turned on at the office is a classic example which has been around since the early days of SETI

Over time they keep printing more USD and we are generating less BTC, what do you think the inevitable result is?  A loaf of bread will cost 1BTC or $1mUSD.

I'd add a tentative  Using MySQL in a transaction-heavy database dealing with people's money.  (Tentative because it didn't really have anything to do with being hacked in this case)
@_date: 2011-05-22 00:13:25
But how on earth do you get to there from here?  Because most people are producing essentially worthless crap and so will lose their jobs.  They want to buy bare essentials (food) but can't.  Riots in the streets.
Also, the Internet as we know it, which makes BitCoin possible, would not exist if not for mass-produced computers and networking driven by consumer demand for entertainment.

Suggestion: link to bitpiggy, the easiest way to buy bitcoins in AUD.

The barter network described in the article uses a virtual currency which is pegged to the Euro.
Despite the current crisis, most "normal" people still consider their country's currency to be more stable than Bitcoin.  They have reasonable faith that the services they barter today will pass for equivalent value next week...  this is difficult for bitcoin given its volatile history.
@_date: 2011-10-21 04:28:49
Even better: inflation benefits the government with Tax Bracket Creep.  They can leave tax brackets constant, and inflation slowly moves you into a higher bracket over time, even though the purchasing power of your new salary stays the same.
