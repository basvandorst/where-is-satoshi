Nothing. Just the want of the people to use the currency. They CREATED the internet.

Very fast and convenient.

Need facts! Think of it as a legal case. Without facts and undeniable proof, there's nothing.

It's sad people lost so much but that's the risk. In the U.S. 
we can write off a loss on our taxes, but not sure about those in other countries or even if it's possible with btc yet.

They've been doing this since the beginning. I know because I'm Mr. Btc.

I didn't fact check but if this is true...there's some potential.

I agree. I hope I don't regret saying this but I've never bad a problem and I'm comfortable with using them. They have the right qualities that we need as consumers to utilize them.

I'm glad the price is low right now. Although my investment is suffering, more people are buying again.

I'm on reddit all the time and check out btc once a day at least. But don't get me wrong, reddit can be harsh against people that say negative things about btc and I catch myself doing it as well. I just want an unbiased new feed (if there is such a thing) that can give me resourceful information about the future of btc.

Completely bias article. Of course he will say that. He makes a living off btc. I hope it does though.

Big step. Donations equals  acceptance. Acceptance equals use. Use equals something...

You should excuse yourself. Look it up.
