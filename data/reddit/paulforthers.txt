Ive filed the report through the u.k fraud and cyber crimes department.. 
Somehow im going to have to get through this... 
Biggest kick in the guts was i refused to pay a few pounds so my daughter could put a few extra fish in our pond... Citing it was a waste of money. Day after i realised this happened. Ive so much to be thankfull for but so much i feel ashamed of too... Years to come when she wants stuff and i cant afford it this will be a constant kick in the teeth.

I acknowledge google didn't sell the domain...  I also realize how bad timing can destroy hopes and dreams....   I will never be able to save that money again and only deposited it the week before so i realised the entire financial loss. basically 10k gbp. basically ruined. Such a stupid, stupid man for five minutes ruined years of saving and hard work.

Well i imagine they would have an easier time of it with fiat currencys.... What is annoying me is that google willingly accepted money to post this phishing site up...  looking at the domain ibittreix and the company who purchased it, there is a long list of references to scams with a simple online search to the address, stretching back a couple of years. I know it was my fault for falling for the site however when its so easy for criminals to get to be top of google with blatant criminal intention then the only poeple that loose out are the little people... Google is happy getting their pound of flesh.... advertising revenue is not being affected and trying to get through to someone at google to vent my frustration is laughable....
