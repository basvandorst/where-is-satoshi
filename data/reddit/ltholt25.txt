_jstanley has a good point, and another thing to consider is that in alot of cases chinese traders are looking to utilize btc as a means to hold capital without accruing CNY

This is the hard bottom for the first day of the PBOC fallout, the Chinese are asleep. It's gonna keep dropping once they wake up

No shit, lost sleep the other night because I woke up in a cold sweat from a nightmare. I had dreamt that I woke up and bitcoin had dropped to $515

Ya know, I don't think that's what he meant 
@_date: 2017-08-01 22:56:25
an agreement amongst the shot callers for the network means everything
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:40:41
I love it, we're closer to the precipice of scaling success than ever and people that don't know what the fuck they're talking about are scared to take the plunge. I'd argue we need this full agreement to go through as much for the good of scaling as for the good of community relations at this point
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:07:55
Maybe it wouldn't happen if you were running part of the show, but thankfully you're not. Both the segwit side and the 2x side need to honor the agreement made. Its been over 2 years of this bullshit scaling debate, and its about time something moves us forward. Blocksize increases is not an inherently bad thing. They will most likely be necessary time and time again in the future. Regardless of whether or not it's a premature assumption to think that they're currently needed for scaling purposes, the community needs the hardfork so as to grease the wheels of diplomacy more than anything

Ya know that's the stupidity to it. China is "banning bitcoin" cus people wanna move their assets into it, and out through it and thusly everyone else follows their lead because they're the largest market.
In every instance of prohibition in history by govts, has that managed to do anything?
No, it's driven the fucking price up. I don't know what the fuck these fair weather cocksuckers are thinking

Ya know joking comments like this are posted every time a shitty mainstream media outlet integrates bitcoin somehow. Why's it feel more ominous than funny this time? :/
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:17:13
I don't wanna come off as a contentious prick, but why's that? All it was was Segwit integration and then a HF to 2MB. Last I checked scaling would be benefitted by both, and the only people adversely affected are the people running full noses, who more or less had to expect an increase in the chain size over time. And now instead of going through with the NYA, the core community has further pissed off the miners. If we thought that 2.5 years was a long time to bicker about scaling solutions, the next time we've gotta do one is going to take forever. Furthermore what reason do Chinese miners have to not swap over their network securing hash power to BCH? I mean I can kinda understand how 8 months for a hardfork could be considered hasty, but simultaneously, ethereum can pump them out much faster without issue. The entire community shot themselves in the foot and now they're looking at the blood splatter saying "See how nice my handywork is!?"

lol I really like that one
I mean, personally I'm one of those morons with vision of global ubiquity grandeur, but as it is now the community/market is filled with people where easily 95% of them don't fully understand the btc protocol. And even then, maybe 1% of them understand the inside politics and debates thoroughly. Smart markets are filled with smart people, and we just seems to keep straying further from that. 
@_date: 2017-04-14 17:18:52
I mean, that's only part of the reason why most people on this sub dislike BU. It's largely an issue of decentralizing the network by giving miners power over block size and fees. The security issues of the protocol itself are only part of the problem. There's a bigger issue at hand.

With LTC having passed segwit, more Core supporters see BTC doing the same as inevitable now 
@_date: 2017-10-12 20:56:31
Takeover attempt? You do recognize that Segwit2x was an agreement between multiple high level bitcoin company executives, in addition to miners and developers right? Last I checked, hostile takeovers don't fall under the umbrella of mutually accepted compromises. 
The community can dislike seg2x all it wants, but let's not forget the diplomatic implications of not going through with the deal here. Seg2x was the solution to 2.5 years of scaling solution debate an infighting that wasn't going to end without the support of the Chinese miners who wanted larger blocks. Now their opposition has what it wants, and they're getting nothing. Future consensus decisions are going to take even longer than this one did for that reason. It's shortsighted, especially considering that blocks will need sizing updates in the future. Payment processing power is the only thing holding this currency back, and now it's going to be held back even longer.

"secret" you know that details of the NYA meeting were published in &lt;6h of its occurrence right? Great way for them to keep a secret

Lol cus that never ends poorly
