Lets try the UASF.. might work.. there's already litecoin which is pretty much the same as what the hard fork crew wants, except it already has segwit.. no need for a slightly shittier litecoin just to copy everyone's balances over.

I doubt it.. probably your best bet is to move the money from your UK account to your US account using transferwise or currencyfair and then deposit it to coinbase from there... transferwise will take about ~0.5% to transfer the funds.. currencyfair can be even cheaper. 
Once you factor in the bank transfer fees and the illiquidity of GBP markets due to the fact that far fewer people trade in GBP I doubt very much if you can get BTC cheaper from any GBP exchanges. I usually recommend that UK users open an EUR bank account and trade in EUR, but since you're already setup for USD trading that's also good.

Dunno :/ GBP has tanked a lot already but maybe it will go down more.. USD could collapse and the EUR is still a broken currency system. You can get RMB accounts in a few Chinese banks in London now.. I'm wondering about getting one of those, but keeping savings in BTC might still be a pretty good idea. Gold coins are probably a 'safe' option as well although they're actually more hassle to exchange than BTC.

Just in case you actually believe this, it isn't true. There is no reason for a HF.

How do most people acquire BTC? They get it from an exchange like coinbase. In spite of the fact that people are always told to hold their private keys, by far the vast majority of users do not. All these user's activity can be aggregated into a shockingly small number of payment channels.. like between coinbase, a few other key exchanges, payment processors like bitpay and maybe the various bitcoin debit card providers.. suddenly 99% of legitimate payment traffic is moved offchain and what's left is basically a hard-core group of geeks who can continue using bitcoin as before due to the much reduced demand for on-chain payments. Longer term side chains can help reduce load on the main chain for payment channels allowing huge scaling while maintaining control of the funds.

I don't think the location of the bank is that important.. some swiss bank transfers may be treated as SWIFT rather than SEPA and attract higher fees, but it probably isn't a big problem.
The main thing is to find an exchange that will open an account for residents of wherever you are resident. Having a bank account in Switzerland doesn't in any way make you resident there.
Gemini only supports a few countries;  and coinbase has a [few more]( if you are not resident in one of those countries you won't be able to open an account there. I think bitstamp.net and kraken.com are more inclusive, but I can't find an explicit country list on their websites.
In theory it might be possible for you to open a corporate account via a company incorporated in one of the supported jurisdictions.. but that's extra fees and costs that probably aren't worth it.

were they paid? probably.. do they even know what they're saying? doubful.. but who cares.

The LN will probably have central hubs, however they will be naturally emergent and anyone can compete to become one. Like with onchain bitcoin end users will retain control of their private keys used to sign LN transactions so the same end user control over funds exists. LN allows practically unlimited very cheap transactions, but there are still limits on the number of users that can be directly supported. 
Many current bitcoin users do not really use bitcoin though, so all users of centralised wallets such as coinbase or xapo essentially count as one user so in that sense unlimited users doing unlimited transactions can be supported.. but that isn't really a LN thing it's just that LN allows existing centralisation to be much much more efficient.

It probably depends what third world country - but there's a good chance this won't work.. particularly with coinbase and gemini (I think gemini only accepts customers resident in the US and maybe the UK).
Kraken and bitstamp might work as long as the 3rd world country is one they're ok with.. you might also be better off with a bank account in the EU rather than switzerland, but maybe switzerland is ok, I'm not sure.

We may not need any on-chain scaling.. there are other tricks such as sidechains that could be used but even that may not be necessary the number of people who care about 'being their own bank' is probably always going to be a small minority of the global population.. probably most people who will ever care are already here.
