No, don't turn it into fiat. Tell them you're happy to release the bitcoins to them, but only as bitcoins. Put pressure on them by saying "As soon as you accept Bitcoin, the donations will be released to you".

Don't picket, let your money talk. Since you seem to be trusted around here (long-time lurker, first-time poster) create a "trust fund" in the form of a wallet and let people send coins to it, then when some coins have accumulated tell the EFF you're going to release the money to them as soon as they accept Bitcoin.

What you can do, however, is doublespend and scam people who accept transactions with 0 confirmations, which is the Bitcoin equivalent of getting somebody to [accept a $200 bill](

Because transactions are instant and confirmations are not?

The Bitcoin structure only makes sense if it's decentralized, with the blockchain taking the place of the central authority. Why jump through all the hoops with government miners if you could just have a centralized currency?

Or you have no winning bet and 65 losing bets, or 65 winning bets and no losing bet. Randomness is random like that.

Gresham's law is only applicable when bad and good money are somehow held together by other forces than market forces, because the law of supply and demand means bad money will depreciate and good money will appreciate until they're at parity.
With Bitcoins and any of your X, there is no such mechanism, so Gresham's Law doesn't apply.

In Canada the government can't, because the Canadian dollar is a currency freely traded on the foreign exchange markets. The bolivar, however, is not - its exchange rate is set by the government, and buying or selling bolivar at other rates than the one set by the government is forbidden. There are also import and export controls in place so there is little to no forex trading outside Venezuela. If you're looking for honest exchange rates, you must look at the black market.

Don't complain, become a competitor. There is room for a Bitcoin stock exchange that isn't shady, doesn't charge through the nose, and has some kind of actual user interface.

Who wants to bet Erik Voorhees will be facing at least one felony charge related to SatoshiDice by the end of 2013?
