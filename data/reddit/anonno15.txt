There is no any document yet :) I'll probably flesh out the idea a little more and re-post it later.

Proof-of-burn is not my idea.. XCP is first burncoin...

Your "shipping in 2 weeks" delivery schedule just got upgraded to "shipping in 4 weeks" one.

An aggregated feed from available exchanges will do. Any single one of them is not reliable enough, but in the end there is always a fair market price for BTC available.

AMA, please? Pretty please? Some proof?

US Government landed man on the Moon, created nuclear bomb and Internet. That being said, until Snowden confirms this - it is all fake.

To the Moon!

Your results satisfied my curiosity.

1 ounce of silver from Coinabul. To convince myself that Bitcoin is real money, not a Monopoly money.
@_date: 2013-03-16 23:26:00
This doesn't look very good for Bitcoin users. 
@_date: 2013-04-05 02:34:12
Short answer - yes, in theory. At least on the scale of VISA / MasterCard / SWIFT.  Things would operate pretty much the same as today, with vastly greater difficulty, blockchain size and hashrate. 
In practice, I doubt it will ever happen in the sense of Bitcoin supplanting everything else.

God damn, reality beats any fictional techno-thriller...

They indeed have plenty of troubles. Stay away from them for a while.
I ordered in November 2012, only to receive shipment in March 2013.
Still a better service than BFL, though :)
@_date: 2013-04-10 04:26:44
Bear in mind that BFL has to actually test their ASICs to see if they are working properly. That would involve solving blocks too.
Anyway it is already known that have 1 (one) sort-of-working 25GH ASIC board.

I'd rather not see a first one. How much growth can be sustained with 500k limit?
@_date: 2013-04-08 06:10:58
Possible workarounds for rogue data in blockchain:
1)Use online wallets... hm... secure online wallets?
2)Use lightweight clients that don't store entire blockchain
3)Use encrypted volumes for blockchain storage - only you can see the data, regardless of its contents

Just go all in and make a paid QA subreddit similar to stackexchange.

Rather improbable,  but still interesting speculation. 
Remember, Tor software was created by government agency

This is a bit a long story, where smaller delays accumulated to extreme (shipment was to Canada). Imagine each step is a week or two:
1. Ordered an item. Took a bit a longer to process than advertised, but no big deal (like 1-2 days more). Got a tracking number.
2. No progress on delivery after 2 weeks. Contacted Coinabul, bla-bla-bla. Was advised to contact US Post.
 
3. Contacted US Post, they advised that sender has to contact them.
4. Asked Coinabul to contact US Post - took them some time to respond. They told that they can't get any useful information from them. Advised to contact Canadian customs.
5. Contacted Customs - they told me they would notify me if the package was seized by them, but no such issue.
6. Told this to Coinabul - they initiated lost item insurance claim processing.
7. Insurance claim processed - they asked me on choice of claim reimbursement, I selected the shipment of original product again.
8. Shipment initiated - was told that package was shipped, but no tracking number.
9. Was told that the package was NOT shipped by mistake, but now is being shipped. Got tracking number.
10. Product shipped finally. By that time Bitcoin raised in value from $10 to $50 and I had a bad aftertaste in the end, losing $200 in value over this time.
While all of this might not be Coinabul's fault and I wish your business to persist, I still disliked the experience. Compare to shopping on Amazon: ordered item Saturday evening - delivered Monday morning!

I don't understand this - if after May 15th, another &gt;500k  block appears, another blockchain fork will happen! To avoid this you need either one of this:
1)Every single network node upgraded or patched. That can't  be guaranteed - see the history of any software product.
2)Block limit kept below 500k indefinitely, or at least until you **know** there are no unpatched/outdated nodes on the network.

...Zhou Tong. Not even once.

It is called "proof-of-work" part.
The actual job is verifying consistency of transactions in blockchain
@_date: 2013-09-05 04:07:52
Overly sensationalized and inaccurate article. 
@_date: 2013-03-16 23:48:14
The difference with Linux is that blockchain is not a software, but a global ledger of user financial transactions. You don't want to mess this one up! Backward compatibility should not be discarded so easily.

I don't know. Try it. What can possibly go wrong?
