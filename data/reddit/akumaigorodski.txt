The very fact that you have received a correct R-value from your payment channel node (correct is the one which hashes to H(R) you previously got from payee) means he did receive the funds.

Hivemind being in sidechain has important consequences as far as I understand. In particular, hivemind miners will be able to veto sidechain progression if decentralized oracle corporation goes rogue, no such possibility in augur since it will live inside ethereum, not on a sidechain.

Your options are:  
* audit the source and compile it yourself:   
* trust bitcoin.org staff as they have my other (plain Bitcoin) wallet listed:   
* just accept the risk of me stelaing some testnet bitcoins from you :)

I can recommend an Eclair node:   
They've got a detailed wiki and devs will answer your questions on gitter in case of what.
@_date: 2018-01-13 11:18:43
I think wallets which automatically open channels with a reputable peers as well as trusted custodians on top of LN will happen. 
But my goal is to try to achieve a compromise of sorts: an autonomous wallet which is relatively easy to use. But being autonomous requires user to understand certain things about Bitcoin and LN, my wallet users should still understand what they are doing so no place for automations and abstractions here.
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:24:08
That's actually a good idea! Think I will do just that, expect it in next update.
@_date: 2018-01-13 11:35:44


Can you elaborate on what has happened?


I can make a phone vibrate, will that be ok?


will do
@_date: 2018-01-13 10:56:54


This one seems to be an outdated node, it does not send a message once funding transaction reaches 6 confirmations. Could you please try to open a channel with one of recommended nodes, wait for 6 confs and check if it can receive?
Before opening a new channel a current one should be closed via app menu -&gt; channel info -&gt; close channel.
@_date: 2018-01-13 07:54:37
huh  
well I've got an idea from this tweet: 
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:17:00
Yes it will, this is a part of LN v1.0 spec so all the implementations will be supporting it sooner ot later.
It just tells a sender where to go once public (visible on a global graph) part of the payment route ends. Something like "once you reach that well known place on a public map, turn north and walk for 2 kilometers".
@_date: 2018-01-12 21:16:49
Which node are you connected to? (can get this info at app menu -&gt; "channel info" and then copy text).
In general, my wallet opens a non-public channel and expects a special message from peer once 6 confirmations pass. Once got this message my wallet can issue payment requests. But the trick is this non-public channel stuff is rather new and there is a lot of old nodes on a network who don't know they have to send that message. Knowing your peer's ID will help me find out if that's the case.
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:22:31
Regarding edit3, there are a lot of unreliable and outdated nodes on the network, that screen flashes so quickly probably means that node is offline. "Dropping connection..." is a generic message which would happen if the peer is offline or not compliant.
@_date: 2018-01-13 07:56:15
For quite some time - yes, that would be the case. But once watchdogs are standartized and implemented it would be possible to also receive funds off-chain and rebalance it that way.
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:02:58


No reason not to, will add it.
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:56:42
What version of Eclair do you use? Thing is my wallet opens a non-public channel and when issuing a payment request it adds an assisted route into that request (so that payer would know where to go once public route ends). And as far as I know only my wallet and a latest version of Eclair support that so far.
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:09:35
Yes, that's a problem for now. Thing is, a channel my wallet opens is always non-public so wallet is not present on a public graph and no one knows how to get to it. 
For that matter my wallet inserts an assisted route into it's payment requests and this assisted route stuff is new, the only implementation which understands it as of now is Eclair desktop node (not even Eclair mobile works although it should).
So funds can be received either from Eclair desktop or my wallet for now.
@_date: 2018-01-12 21:28:15
even in a wallet which can receive LN payments, you don't actually need a watcher as long as you only use it to send payments. 
Anyway, my wallet won't support receiving on a mainnet at least for LN v1.0 since watchers are not there yet.
@_date: 2018-01-13 09:19:47
establishing a channel with this one, will let you know how it goes.
@_date: 2018-01-16 08:13:30
I really like this one:  will use it, expect it to appear in the next update.
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:34:08
That's a mobile wallet right?  
It's source code is closed for the time being so can't exactly say which version  of Eclair Core it uses. I have it running on my phone and it does fail to send payments to my wallet while Eclair v0.2-alpha8 on my desktop has no issues.
@_date: 2018-01-14 06:02:17
Eclair mobile 0.2.3 uses v0.2-alpha12 which should work fine with my app's payment requests. So this seems like another bug somewhere, will find out!
@_date: 2018-01-13 10:07:04
if this proves to be a serious issue I'll go ahead and add multiple channels, nothing is set in stone here.
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:04:34
Thanks for testing!
1. That's a familiar bug, thought I got rid of it but looks like not quite, will look into it. There are many places with links (app menu -&gt; wallet settings for example), do the links work there?  
2. I know about this annoyance, will figure something out. In the meantime, pressing "back" will remove a keyboard.
@_date: 2018-01-12 12:46:34
Nope, not with my wallet. This is a minimal LN implementation aimed specifically at mobile devices so only sending and receiving your own payments for now.
In general, using mobile for this is a really bad idea because, yes, a routing LN node should have to be online 24/7 and it has to depend on a local full Bitcoin Core node.
@_date: 2018-01-13 19:37:02
What happens after 6 confirmations is Bob-Alice channel obtains a `shortChannelId` which is required to make a channel visible to all the other nodes on a global graph (if Bob and Alice want it to be visible at all). 
But Alice sees the channel right away since she's a part of it so she has all the required knowledge about that channel right from start and can use it to build a payment route.
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:46:47
Thanks! I've submitted blind tokens idea to lightning-rfc repo here  and Rusty even liked it so maybe it will get somewhere.
Rating system is a good idea and I recall related discussions somewhere in lightning-dev mailing list. This definitely won't make it to LN v1.0 but quite maybe something like that will happen later.
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:46:05
An incoming payment can't happen if you don't want it to as it requires a payment request to be generated. It's not like Bitcoin where anyone can send you funds just by knowing an address.
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:04:23
That's true, showing an unconfirmed balance as if it's available and then not allowing to spend it is not very user-friendly. But I don't like an idea of clogging an interface with multiple balances either. 
How about not showing an unconfirmed balance at all so user will see an incoming pending transaction but "Wallet is empty" message until it's confirmed? Not trusting unconfirmed transactions, especially on SPV wallet, is a good idea anyway.
@_date: 2018-01-13 20:03:43
Outdated just means it's old and thus does not follow new developments in LN protocol. Someone should upgrade it but people may just not care since it's testnet.
You should buy more of those coffees and thus make a room for receiving funds. Moreover, if, say, your initial channel balance is 100/0 and you spend 1 and it's now 99/1, this does not mean you can get 1 back now as there is an implicit protocol enforced undependable reserve which includes a commit transaction fee. More info on this here: 
I admit this is confusing and I'm working on ways to make this more obvious.  
UPD: that link mainly talks about spending limitations (one can never spend the whole balance because commit tx fee), but the same reserve also affects receiving (one must spend an implicit reserve in order to be able to start receiving funds). Confusing as hell probably :)

@_date: 2018-01-15 20:01:54
that popping up message is for testnet only, useful for debug resons and users can report what's happening easily. Of course I'll remove that on mainnet version.


Well what can I say. Please offer a better one!
@_date: 2018-01-13 11:52:53
it was down for some time, quite possible they were upgrading it.
@_date: 2018-01-13 09:18:22
I've managed to establish a channel with this node and just got a 6th confirmation and immediately got that special message afterwards. My wallet is capable of receiving funds now.
Can you please check if your wallet still has this issue?
@_date: 2018-01-13 07:38:44


Not in my wallet, but possible in Eclair mobile.


That's a protocol level restriction which will be removed in LN v1.1 but for now there's no way around that.
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:06:09
I'll go ahead and ask them on gitter, will let you know one find out

It's an HD wallet but you can't yet choose outputs (that's in long term plans though)
@_date: 2015-12-23 21:09:56
If you don't see benefit then don't use Bitcoin as payment option, what's the problem?
@_date: 2015-12-15 07:44:00
OK, I think I'll make it configurable so users would be able to choose between Satoshi and bit in wallet settings.
@_date: 2015-12-14 20:57:07
Well, my rationale is that at some point, I hope sooner than later, we'll start using Satoshis anyway. I want users of Bitcoin to understand from day one that there's this standard unit called Bitcoin and this minimal unit called Satoshi (albeit worthless right now) and not clutter their heads with other rather artificial denominations.
@_date: 2015-12-14 13:53:18
Not, it does not as of yet. Why do you think NFC might be useful, what's the usage scenario?
@_date: 2018-08-12 06:32:36
Yes I guess you could set a temporary channel id to be a payment request and push an amount so merchant knows what's all this about but this feature has to be supported in all implementations (recognizing a request in temporary id) and also customer has to open a channel with this exact merchant and no one else.
Another issue with pushing is there is no proof of payment of any kind while fallback address is contained in a signed payment request.
@_date: 2015-12-14 13:50:57
I know it won't work for everyone, that's why it's really easy to go away from coins screen and never come back if one does not want to.
@_date: 2018-08-11 09:31:49
BLW uses a special server to fetch a bunch of LN payment routes in certain cases and is fully autonomous otherwise, it has been like this from day one, more details here: 
Basic guarantees are: I'm not capable of knowing your on/off chain balance or stealing your funds but if server goes offline then you won't be able to send LN payments to most recipients (but you can still take the money back from channels and migrate to other wallet).
Server is open source:  wallet can use multiple servers at once and you can run your own.
Still I'm not proud of this decision and see this as a temporary necessity, a long term plan is to hopefully make route finding to happen locally.
@_date: 2018-08-14 13:51:19
This still leaves an issue of having to connect to merchant directly which may result in a node with thousands of direct inward connections for the popular vendors. 
I've had some conversations with merchants and it turns out they don't want that because current implementations, as they say, tend to become unstable on getting too many channels.
@_date: 2016-03-31 19:43:03
This is one of the two developments in Bitcoin space I'm very excited about (the other one is lightning). Any estimate on when this could go live, like this year/next year/when it's done?

thanks for your feedback, I appreciate it a lot.
Regarding your points:
- Fees can already be adjusted (in wallet settings).
- Currently I use all the time available to work on Bitcoin contracts but once that's done I'll try to work on "visual" ways of spending.
- Copy button is implemented in fresh update which is already available. Just update your app and the button will appear.
@_date: 2016-01-20 09:01:33
Thanks for reporting this, too. I'll look into it. Just to clarify: does an app crashes totally once you tap a lock icon or does it bring you to password prompt page? (the latter is intended behavior)
@_date: 2016-01-29 22:48:10
You're describing a rather strange situation since it's technically not possible not to set some password, wallet just would not have been created otherwise. There is no such thing as default password and mnemonic code is a different thing, please read about it in detail here: 
I suppose you did provide some password, please try to remember what it was. Also, your money is safe because you have a mnemonic code. If you can't recall the password then just reinstall an app from scratch and use your mnemonic code to recover a wallet.
@_date: 2016-01-28 16:15:44
Well this is quite strange tbh. Thing is it's not possible to not set a password, wallet just would not have been created if you did not provide one. "Default password" does not exist either and mnemonic code is a different thing, please read about all of this in detail here: 
Anyway, your bitcoins are safe because you have a mnemonic code. In a worst case just reinstall an app from scratch and restore your wallet using a mnemonic code.
@_date: 2019-11-18 20:27:40
Hey, it can be seen on a screenshot that on-chain wallet is "Connecting to peers", that is the reason. I can tell because your channel balance is not decreased: it's 923775 SAT which is equal to funding amount, so that payment is not even in-flight yet because app awaits for on-chain to connect.
To make an LN payment a chain height needs to be known, and for that to happen at least one remote Bitcoin node must be connected. So the question is why is on-chain permanently disconnected. Did you try to connect BLW to your own node? If yes, it may not be reachable. Otherwise, perhaps you use an internet connection which blocks certain ports (including Bitcoin node standard port), try to change your connection type and see if that helps.
@_date: 2019-03-22 06:54:24
It's actaully -3000 SAT meaning nothing at all can be received right now and at least 3000+ SAT should be spent to be able to receive anyhting at all. 
This is how outgoing channels work since all the balance is on your side at start, more info here: 
You can get an incoming channel which lets you receive right away by buying it here: 
Also there's a free incoming channels giveway here: 
@_date: 2018-06-03 11:31:31
Not currently but they are working on it: 
@_date: 2018-06-03 11:42:07
I'd say this is a bit too strong of a statement. Yes, privacy compromise is being made here but all privacy? At  I explain in details that wallet:
- always requests partial routes only
- caches successful routes and often reuses them without asking server for the second time
- does not need server to send direct payments to a peer
- privacy concerned users may use their own server
@_date: 2018-06-01 08:32:49
Yes, it is implemented. For now you need to get a wallet online at least once per 10 days period if you have received any off-chain funds, wallet also sends a scheduled system notification so there's no need to remember this.
This "online at least once per 10 days" rule will be removed once watchtowers are implemented.
By the way, this can be tested live on testnet right now, I maintain a `03dc39d7f43720c2c0f86778dfd2a77049fa4a44b4f0a8afb62f3921567de41375` testnet node which performs this exact type of attack: open a channel with it, send out a few payments, then receive one which is larger than 50 000 SAT and see what happens.
@_date: 2018-06-01 11:25:30
Both default routing servers may go offline one day and soon after that you won't be able to make LN payments to anyone except your direct peer. Your options would be:
- close all channels and migrate to some other wallet
- provide different Olympus server address in wallet settings and continue with it (you can spin up your own server if no one happens to run it at that point)
@_date: 2018-06-01 07:06:36
I'm not involved in creation of that fork, just decided to bring LN there since it's marginally hard.
@_date: 2018-06-01 06:02:39
All of this is correct. To somewhat sweeten a routing server pill: there are two default servers, app automatically uses the next one if the previous one is unresponsive, users can add more servers and spin up their own.
@_date: 2018-06-01 12:25:04
Yes, an unlimited number of servers can be added in "Settings (gear icon)" -&gt; "Manage Olympus servers".
A guide can be found here: 
In theory it might be profitable to run these servers since they sell storage tokens which are used to store channel backups. Tokens are also planned to be used to watch revoked transactions in future.
@_date: 2018-06-01 07:55:44
Yes, I am.

This particular post is not related to BTC wallet.
@_date: 2018-06-12 15:24:40
 probably runs an old LND or c-lightning node which does not understand routing hints contained in my wallet's payment requests. Or maybe indeed there's just no route to ACINQ present at all.

Only Eclair based implementations for now.

It's very arguable which way is more convoluted here. Funding an outgoing channel in a fresh wallet requires more actions, time, attention, more on-chain transactions even (one into wallet, second into channel) while giving out fiat and scanning a QR is near effortless.
@_date: 2019-02-10 17:52:44
Yes, Alice lost 0.4 BTC and it's up to Bob to refund them, which would be exactly the case if zero-conf off-chain spending was disabled. In fact, Alice would have lost 0.5 BTC then so with instant channels she has more options, not less.
@_date: 2019-02-10 18:19:23
Fiat would be one way. For example: buy a voucher and then redeem it into a channel and spend it right away.
@_date: 2019-02-10 17:57:43
A reward would be an up-front payment they take from fundee to push an amount and cover possible losses. Or an exchange withdrawing funds to user's wallet this way.
@_date: 2016-02-09 14:27:10
Blockchain pruning + UTXO commitments. Once there is a way for a new node to get the entire UTXO set without full blockchain validation we don't really need a full blockchain anymore.
@_date: 2016-02-21 08:32:18
Presence of third party apps does not hurt an app store, quite to the contrary. Same logic can be applied to miners and LN.
@_date: 2016-02-11 18:28:11
Technically it's indeed scaling but at the cost of centralization which is fine for large clearing houses like Coinbase and totally not fine for individual node maintainers. 
There are better ways to scale Bitcoin like SegWit, Ligtning Network, blockchain pruning + UTXO commitments. All that's needed is some time and patience.
@_date: 2016-02-11 20:19:34
This is an interesting point of view. AFAIK most people agree the number of nodes drops because the size of blockchain grows and it becomes increasingly harder to maintain it.
I own a full node and it's quite manageable so far. In general I'm not against block size bump but it must happen after necessary improvements, namely UTXO commitments. Once that is implemented everyone can just turn block pruning on and keep the size of blockchain constant.
@_date: 2018-03-06 18:32:35
Soon but no exact ETA. A lot of work still remains to be done, plus I'm dependent of full nodes implementers (c-lightning, LND and Eclair) and can't go mainnet before they do.
@_date: 2018-07-07 08:29:15
BLW developer here. Reusing the same payment request is actually dangerous and should never be attempted.
The reason is that on fulfilling a payment request for the first time a secret preimage is revealed by receiver to all the routing nodes, by design (so potentially to the whole world knows) and if a sender tries to send another payment using the same hash then a routing node can "fulfill" a payment without actually routing it to a receiver, because it already knows a corresponding secret preimage.
For this reason there is a warning embedded right into a payment request. Also BLW won't ever allow to even try to send a payment if it knows a related hash has already been used.
@_date: 2017-07-16 16:29:31
Thanks for the heads up! I've updated nodes and info on site, they're all UASF now.
