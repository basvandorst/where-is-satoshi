I bought into bitcoin not because I think it's better, but because (especially after this last election) I see how powerful people can influence the population. 
I continue to be impressed by the impact of a good high level marketing strategy. And even more so if it's shady.

don't let perfect be the enemy of good. accessibility is important.

yes. because confiscating gold = confiscating a life.

not good things. but at least you've got the choice to remain alive. I'm not defending the confiscation of someone's property. My point is that confiscating gold is not equal to killing someone. 
A person can come back from losing gold. Not many people come back from death.

Hmm.  I like the idea of hosting the website locally. However there is a lot here to go over, and probably not feasible in the near term (I'm one of two founder/operators in the business, and the sole IT person...with no formal IT experience.) I'll have to come back to this message after graduation in 6 months. What's your suggestion for acquiring a domain name outside of a third party like godaddy?

Unfortunately in the small business world I don't have a ton of time for elitism. I'd like to get out of the godaddy grasp in the future, but right now any "free time" I have goes into the product.

This seems like the easiest route. If publishing the address could be problematic - I'm considering just working directly with anyone who would like to use bitcoin; sending them my wallet address.

I'm not sure I'm quite ready to set up a lightning node. BTC Pay Server looks like a good option. Thanks.

'Despite the fact that his message has been of great benefit to many people, I don't find his message personally important. Therefore when describing him on the internet, I'm going to say this: "He is a guy that wrote a self help book with no new ideas but has people worshipping him like a God. He was on Joe rogan's show and said he found a way to monetize social justice warriors and has been milking the anti social justice warrior types for a few years. No one important."'
Good job.
