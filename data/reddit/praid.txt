I have been in Bitcoin since 2012 and we have seen hundreds of +30% dips during that time, this is nothing to even mention og talk about.

Good news! I wonder what they will do with Segwit2X in 8 days.

He obviously dosen't know anything about how important it is to diversify your investments - He is holding almost everything (over half a billion dollars) in BCH which from a financial perspective is retardedly stupid. Imagine an investment firm holding all their clients money in a single company, it would never happen.

Just wait for that gigantic $700 million mining farm going up in New York. That should give BITMAIN som mining competition.

I guess forced KYC on exchanges would be the solution?

I have tried several times withdrawing both bitcoins and fiat. Gox still wont let me...
@_date: 2014-02-22 14:55:52
These transactions are probably MtGox themselves withdrawing bitcoins and selling on other exchanges.
@_date: 2014-02-20 23:44:11
The more i look at it seems pretty obvious that MtGox are selling cheap bitcoins on other exchanges. That way they can make a huge profit and after a while open up for withdrawals on MtGox again. 
@_date: 2014-02-05 15:21:35
Im surprised that so many knows about bitcoin. Thought it would be less than 10%
@_date: 2014-02-23 08:56:42
I think you are right, he could do that really easy and make a lot of money from it. It was probably his intention especially with the last announcement.

Very pretty
@_date: 2014-02-27 09:13:26
I dont doubt that, but that is still many years from now. My plan was to hold those bitcoins for a very long time and if 1 bitcoin end up costing $10.000+ in 5 years that would really kill me.

If they took 75% i would still be happy

Why on earth would you trade that much money in a single trade. At least split it into 5 trades or more to reduce the risk.
Better advice: Use etherdelta or a smart contract.

He supports it which makes Roger green with envy.
@_date: 2019-08-25 15:15:23
Normally I would agree but Roger Ver and the BCH community have tirelessly been targeting Bitcoin and Bitcoin core members day in and day out. Just go to r/btc and search Adam Back (or any other bitcoin core member) and it will make more sense.

lol you can't be serious. Do you even know what a scam is?
In no way directly or indirectly does that make Bitcoin a scam. 
Try again

Nice platform but they have really high fees.
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:38:46
Very interesting but I would really like if Bitcoin Core would make a clear statement about what is being worked towards and a timeframe for these updates.

just above $6000

You can keep posting that but it still doesn't change the fact that it could have a huge impact on the bitcoin price and adoption.
@_date: 2018-03-02 13:20:11
You are posting links from r/btc which are full of imbeciles that would love to see Bitcoin fail and do nothing but spread FUD against Bitcoin to promote Bcash...

Yobit is a huge scam. Lots of their wallets are in constant maintenance but they still allow deposits and trading. Also they use wrong names for many of their coins like ATM which is ATMChain but they use it for the coin Atonomi. Besides that they used to do pump and dumps on the exchange which is highly illegal (not sure if they still do it) 
@_date: 2019-01-24 15:50:05
If we compare it to previous times where the mempool experienced congestion it was around 350,000 daily transactions and we are getting pretty close to hitting that.

That is true there are more room. Segwit adoption was at 14% in january 2018 and now it's at 40% but haven't really moved the last 6 months. Where it gets "critical" I don't know maybe someone has a better answer.
@_date: 2018-11-29 21:00:55
@_date: 2019-01-19 11:12:02
Not sure but could be a large mining pool or an exchange like Bitmex that only process bitcoin withdrawals once each day at a specific time.

SEC briefly comments on why they are hesitant to approve an ETF at the senate tetimony on cryptocurrenties:

He is such a fucking liar. Should be back behind bars asap.
@_date: 2018-02-13 15:12:04
That is not correct, you don't need a direct channel to ebay just an open LN channel.
@_date: 2018-02-13 15:32:50
SEC are very reluctant to approve a bitcoin ETF, it would probably be much easier getting a an ETF approved outside the U.S.

Also high volatility is one of the main reasons why SEC haven't approved any Bitcoin ETF yet.
@_date: 2018-07-20 21:20:30
There were like 20 altcoins back in 2014 and the total marketcap was below $10 billion so of course it will drop with more and more shitcoins getting introduced everyday.

Nice detective work. At least they haven't been hacked, I wonder what will happen to all the coins if btc-e never goes live again.
