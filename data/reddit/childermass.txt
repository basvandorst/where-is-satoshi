Well, it could also be valuable against several kinds fo government intrusion/mandate, but yes, it sound like it'd be primarily a "duress" feature, but it might deter some crime through uncertainty etc...
I've been thinking more about the on screen keyboard, ING does it as a PIN pad with rotating location, but pin's aren't super secure as passwords go...  also, I don't know of any keyloggers that actually log mouse movements in the the wild, but there might be better/easier ways to defeat them and use a regular qwerty-ish keyboard that wouldn't be too cumbersome to enter passwords on, but that varied it's location and size/aspect ratio randomly enough that the pattern entering a strong password wouldn't be detectable to a mouselogger...  Dunno...  
I do like the idea of GPG protecting the wallet, but then good backup has to backup encrypted key too.. I guess you can back up two different locations so neither one in itself grants access, but lose either one and there goes your money, which may not scale/work well for average users...

I submitted this on Bitcoin forum to deafening silence, thought I'd see if anyone here had feedback or thoughts....

Yeah, I like the idea of allowing/encouraging hardware solutions, but I'd like to also be able to backup the real keys such that losing or having the hardware stolen doesn't actually lose me my money... I guess having backup tokens might accomplish this, but having some diversity of solutions out there is probably good for security too...
