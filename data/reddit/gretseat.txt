@_date: 2017-08-13 07:55:50
Do a give away for Bitcoin, make more people millionaires with you!
@_date: 2017-08-14 02:30:27
3k is enough to start a business? Since when?
@_date: 2017-08-13 07:41:55
I did that at 2700 :( bought back at 4k
@_date: 2017-08-05 20:33:57
@_date: 2017-08-13 07:53:04
Yeah now she checks it more than I do...
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:52:49
I don't get it. He basically said he's not accepting it? How is this good?
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:31:59
I thought that's all it was though, a way to make money with a new currency
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:31:44
But this is a huge drop. And it's not being used anymore... And it's... It's going down
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:21:16
So it's gonna grow lower and lower and day by day the leftovers will slowly disappear until someone throws them away?

@_date: 2017-09-14 17:18:40
I understand. I've invested only what I can lose but it's still would suck to see it disappear. The dream that is.
@_date: 2017-09-13 16:39:16
Little? It has dropped a thousand dollars in less than a month.
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:18:51
You think? 
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:31:44

@_date: 2017-09-14 17:21:43
You're a very optimistic being

Even though dollar value is what matters.
Also didn't China ban Bitcoin? 
Is this the end of Bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-05-28 17:11:37
I'm upset too. I JUST sold mine when it went down to 451 from 455 and now I'm kicking myself. :/
@_date: 2017-07-21 01:33:06
Where do you see the buys and sells
@_date: 2017-07-15 23:37:40
@_date: 2017-06-15 00:52:56
Thank you. For understanding that not everyone is a troll on the internet. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 23:13:51
@_date: 2017-06-15 00:03:23
How else do you expect to get started? 
@_date: 2017-06-14 23:16:25
Why are there two different ones. Why not combine?
@_date: 2017-06-06 00:12:04
Hey, don't listen to this guy, he can't be trusted. Send it to me. I know how to dispose of it properly. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 00:54:12
I've looked at countless links people have provided and I have no idea what I'm reading. Should we be scared? Should we not? I have some Bitcoin I have purchased. And it slowly declining in value... It was 28 bucks two days ago. And 20 today... Should I be worried or buy more? Why will no one answer.
@_date: 2017-06-14 23:40:31
Well if someone would explain it in simple terms maybe people wouldn't freak out.
@_date: 2017-06-15 01:48:20
Private key? You mean like a vault?
@_date: 2017-06-14 23:30:03
I'm so confused about this whole shit show going on right now, I don't even know who segwit is (sounds like a Harry Potter character) and who is the bad guy here.
@_date: 2017-06-10 23:38:34
I mean I don't have 2800 lying around... 
@_date: 2017-06-14 16:53:26


ELI5? Because I tried reading it, and it's confusing as fuck for someone who knows nothing about bitcoin
@_date: 2017-06-14 23:56:50
But no answer. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-06-11 03:08:55
No sir. I have .003 right now. Trying to trade my way up though. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 23:10:37
What is with this crash
@_date: 2017-06-13 03:36:13
Okay, good idea.
@_date: 2017-06-10 22:09:47
I just want it to drop again, so I can buy Bitcoin for a reasonable price. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 03:40:30
So for someone who has no idea about currency does that mean the dollar has a high market cap?
@_date: 2017-06-14 23:56:36
You explained it better than anyone else has.
@_date: 2017-06-14 17:00:08
This. Didn't know why so many people said "I made it to the front page!" when normally all of my posts go to the front of the subreddit I'm on... 
@_date: 2017-06-14 23:13:14
Well, terrible idea to do it right before this crash.
@_date: 2017-06-17 20:50:22
so... is coinbase bad to use to buy Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-06-14 23:39:26
That's the answer I wasn't looking for. Already tried reading this. It made no fucking sense because of all the big words.
@_date: 2017-06-17 21:08:17
Well yeah. But I mean what is the estimate on Bitcoin going up or dropping. This August 1st thing is quite the sticky situation.
@_date: 2017-06-15 01:46:38
Damn man. Thanks man. You should definitely copy and paste this to have it stickied!
@_date: 2017-06-06 00:10:43
Okay. I know nothing about currency, is there a good/bad of Bitcoin being worth more? I mean, isn't it bad it's getting so expensive? 
Like, the dollar is a dollar, and a euro is like (idk) 1.1 US dollars?
So why would Bitcoin being a lot be a good thing?
What is the good part of it going to (let's say) 27k?
@_date: 2017-06-11 11:54:03
Bought it at like... 1700 or something.
@_date: 2017-06-13 03:48:36
I was reading Forex and she says "how is this going" I said "it's up to almost 3000. Remember when I bought it at 1700? Well now I have more money because it keeps going up" and she said she wanted to give me 200 to invest since it seems like it's better than the stock market
@_date: 2017-06-17 20:48:27
What if I put 200 in right now?
@_date: 2017-06-14 16:51:29
So twice as many coins in our accounts, but at the same price? 
@_date: 2017-06-14 23:15:10
Imagine it being 10 bucks again, I'd stock up on them if it did hit 10
@_date: 2017-06-06 03:28:28
But I mean for the currency. Not trading purposes
@_date: 2017-06-13 03:35:33
When you live paycheck to paycheck yes.
@_date: 2017-06-10 22:08:52
Sorry. I meant I bought that 50 back when it was like 1700 or somethibn
@_date: 2017-06-15 00:26:52
... and this is why no one is getting answers. Thanks for nothing.
@_date: 2017-06-11 15:31:01
No. I originally spent like 50 bucks buying Bitcoin
