If Butterfly focuses on hardware and stays away from mining bitcoins themselves, they basically mandate that anyone who wants to competitively mine use their hardware, which can only be bought from them.
Since the difficulty of mining is determined by the overall power of the network, so long as Butterfly keeps developing newer, faster, better versions of their technology there is a natural upgrade/obsoletion cycle that will drive increasing sales over multiple product generations.
It's actually pretty smart - They can mine with their much-faster, in-development hardware (the next generation), then once it's finished they sell it to all their existing users, plus those who see the opportunity and want to get involved with the next state-of-the-art mining system.
Their only real risk is failing to deliver or pricing their product too high relative to the creation/R&amp;D cost, which will ring the dinner bell for competition to create a parallel line and sell it for less.
So long as they're the only big ASIC hardware player, the mining world is their oyster.

.0001 bitcoin per user per day? So at current prices that's about 1/20th of a penny in US dollars...
I guess people really don't value their time.
Also incidentally, this means you can serve about **10,000 payouts worth of ads per 1BTC "donated"** to the faucet... This is pretty blatantly an attempt to profit from pageviews under the guise of a faucet - This will help nobody but yourself, explain your intentions.

If I were pirat, I'd hit it again tonight.  Market is crazy thin, everybody is off balance and ginned up on conspiracy talk.
If we see the price drop to sub $5 between now 8AM PST monday, I buy the pirat scenario.  Otherwise It's probably just overly concerned holders THINKING that the pirat scenario will mean a big drop in value, so they sell while the price is 'high', which becomes a self fulfilling prophesy.

You have to admit it's different than a laundry service, as a laundry service that cheats will be quickly caught since someone doesn't get the money they're expecting.  Online wallets?  Not so much.     You have to admit that if their whole schtick is anonymity and security for the system as well as the users there is more risk of walk-away fraud than using a open-web service with a real name/company and identity holding the bag at the end of the day.
Not saying this is useless, but I think it would have to be built into an existing Web of Trust or have a founders real-life identity on the line.

Yes but Googles business is matching up content with ads from a fairly vast and diverse network of advertisers - The problem with corporations is if they're paying the bills for an ostensibly "unbiased" news source, they can apply leverage.  When you have a middleman like Google handling the negotiations, their motives are actually quite good - They get paid to help advertisers place with content producers - Not a specific advertiser, but any within their network, or as often happens companies pick specific sites they WANT to advertise with.   You can't apply pressure because business removed will be business replaced by someone else.
As far as you knowing journalists, that's great - My point is when you know the game is baseball, you play baseball or nobody thinks of you as a baseball player.  Journalists in the system are still there because they understand the rules, and some things just don't get covered for the good of the organization.  Ask your friends.
This is not a flawless system, but it's better than the pay-for-play system in the mainstream media.   My point with the CNN/Taco Bell reporting was that it's an advertisement.   An infomercial. Not News.
  CNN used to cover important stories, now they just wait for talking points from whoever pays the bills and spice things up with dramatic music to prove how newsy it all is.  Their latest schtick has been "Buying THOUSANDS of rounds of ammo on the internet" tied to both the maryland theater shooter and several "copycats" heard talking about it, and who had purchased "THOUSANDS of bullets on the internet".
The reason?

A physical bitcoin is a paper wallet, but a paper wallet is not neccesarily a physical bitcoin.
The difference is a wallet requires network verification every time, while a physical bitcoin does not require a network connection, since the intact seal provides physical verification.
That's like saying a horse is the same as a car because they both take you places while ignoring the other differences.

You don't need to employ bots or automated bids, your whole structure is designed to get as many people bidding as possible and then screw everybody but the winner.  If two people play and the players are competitive, their best case scenario is a small nominal gain for one of them, a larger loss for the other, and a large profit for you.  If more than two people participate in a given auction, your profit goes up while the value available to "win" stays...exactly the same.
So heads you win, tails your players lose.  Even if you win, you still lose.
Nice attempt there, though, I didn't even mention anything automated - Just said you're a sucker to play.
I don't like people using Bitcoin to sucker people, go away.

Check out the Armory bitcoin client - You can create a wallet with a paper backup (scan the QR code or type in the long string of numbers to use) as "Watch only", which means you see what goes into it and comes out of it in your client, but the private key isn't on the computer so you can't send bitcoins from it, and you aren't vulnerable if you're hacked (which is pretty unlikely in the current state of bitcoin IMO)   
Not too difficult, although it's experimental.

If it's a no-brainer investment to you, think of how many other people must recognize the opportunity - especially when Butterfly Labs is putting out press releases designed to alert folks like you to it.
This is a problem because the difficulty (i.e. how much computational power it takes to generate a reward on average) is determined by taking the total number of reward blocks planned to be distributed, and dividing that by total network computational power.
So, if Butterfly Labs sells nothing but 12 of their $30,000 1Th/s units over the next year, those alone would cause the difficulty to double, since the reward stays the same while the network computational power went from 12Th/S to 24Th/s and actually the reward is being cut by 50% in December.
TL:DR The more units they sell, the less each one will generate for everyone using one.  If you're going to buy one, get it ASAP because it'll never be more valuable than it is yesterday.

BitInstant is a big deal.  It's an easy way to get USD into BTC, which is what was lacking before.   Right now the system is still clunky at best, and certainly expensive - But it's fast, and it's available.
I'd been meaning to try it for about 2 weeks - Just got around to it yesterday, which of course means the price immediately spikes.  Sorry about that for anyone else trying to buy - It would be interesting to get weekly volume numbers released by BitInstant to see if spikes in BI activity has any obvious correlations to BTC price action.
@_date: 2012-07-02 21:50:39
Erik: How are you being compensated for your role in this - Does your end come out of costs?  If so, please detail all fees because I can't find them.
1: Why are you trying to raise so much for a project with virtually no overhead?   
10% of net profit for total 60,000USD initial investment puts the value of the company conservatively at 600,000USD... But you're starting with nothing other than your basic ebay infrastructure and the capital you've raised from GLBSE?
What's to stop anyone else from doing the same thing but offering 20% of the profit - If it's really as easy and lucrative as you make it out to be, it seems like your asking price for investment is pretty out of whack with the potential return...  
If I do my math correctly, 1BTC=1Share=0.00001% of profit from your venture. 
So assume you take the 60k use that to buy 80k worth of discounted gift cards, 100k worth of merchandise sold for fair market value (which is all you can hope for given the quantity you'll be trying to sell, I assume you don't have many employees)...  So 60k is called "cost, and depending on how you do your math either 40k or 20k is "Profit" (not including shipping, labor, etc)
With 40k "Profit", an investment of 100BTC or 100 shares recieves a payout of $40, or approx. 6% ROI (assuming 1btc costs $6.5) over whatever period of time it takes to sell the merchandise, again not including warehousing fees is applicable. 
Lots of holes in this... Please be up front with how you do business, way too many scams living off Bitcoin already.

If this is an experiment, you should aim to raise a smaller quantity, say 1,000 shares for 1%.  If the project is wildly successful and you find yourself with not enough stuff to sell you can start a second project which should be more valuable since you'll have proven the concept.
BTC currency exchange risk was mentioned - this could really bite you.  It goes both ways, but if it goes against you (BTC price goes up) you'll have unreasonably angry investors at no real fault of your own.   It will be a balancing game deciding how much inventory to keep vs. value to keep in BTC to hedge against exchange rate moves.

Let me explain to you how a carnival game works (which I also consider "scams") 
Step 1: Have a game of skill that is difficult to win (Tossing rings on a bottle, balancing your non-refundable bids vs. low value discount items, whatever)
Step 2: Have prizes where in the unlikely event that someone wins, the cost of the prize is less than the cost of entry (This would be cheap toxic stuffed animals, or your "Bitcoin Arbitrage Engine"
Step 3: Profit!  Heads you win, tails you win.  Even if they win, you do too.   
The only problem with all of this, is it's a scam - Players can't win in the long run, they can only get stupid lucky or not play.

There is no regulatory "law" for Bitcoin, so no difference in the eyes of said law between users.  Accredation for bulk purchases requires access to capital in direct proportion, other than that have fun cowboy.
As to other alternatives, check out the OTC markets like Bitcoin-OTC or Bitcoinary,  has a couple people selling lots of 100-500 btc for below gox prices.
"Bulk" is different from person to person, so the question really is what does bulk mean to you - 50btc? 500? 10,000?  Not fishing for details, but scale matters when deciding where to go.

They're not - They're setting themselves up to be the dedicated mining hardware giants of the space, and defending themselves with patents on processors optimized for bitcoin transactions.
Second best will not be as good, because they won't have the IP - Most miners will buy the best hardware, which will allow BFL economies of scale otherwise out of reach, allowing them to price their superior product below their competitors.
BFL isn't destroying their jobs, they're pioneering a new market where they'll be the biggest fish, forever (assuming their tech really is the last possible evolution, and that's not marketing hype)

But how do you know how much gold or silver you have in that coin?   Either you weigh the coin, or you... wait for it... trust the issuing organization.
A Gold Eagle is 1oz of gold certified by the US government - You may not trust issuers of physical bitcoins, but you must recognize the identical nature of the issuing relationship.  They guarantee the contents of the physical object, be weight in gold or balance of a sealed bitcoin wallet.

he's saying the druggies are swapping their dollars for bitcoins, and spending the bitcoins on silkroad or similar, which then sells them back into the market.
Frankly I think it's just generally increasing usage - BitInstant has been around for a while and it's made it MUCH easier to turn your USD$ into BTC, I doubled my holdings last week thanks to BitInstant.   The first time I funded to gox I went wire transfer =&gt; egold =&gt; liberty reserve =&gt; gox and it took over a week.   With BitInstant I paid a smaller fee overall, and funded from cash =&gt; gox in 20 minutes.
They solved Bitcoins main problem - Getting USD to BTC without having to jump through a million hoops, and it's a big deal.

You invested in this, but you don't know when it becomes profitable?  Ok.....  Just throwing money at the wall?  Maybe you should be a player not an investor.
Here, i'll help:  No.  When there are 50 players hanging out on the site, margins will be compressed to a point where the potential profit is fractions of a mBitcoin, but you (the house) make cubic assloads of money (relative to the value of the thing at auction)   
Just because the model works doesn't mean it's honest - If you "auction" 1btc for .50btc and 5 players participate, 4 players will lose .50btc, one player will "win" 1btc, and the house makes 1.5btc - Is that a proportional return on the work you did there?  Did the player who "won" the 1btc get rewarded appropriately for the amount of risk they took on?     
Now how often do you think a 1BTC auction will close at 50% face value?  Once you've got 50 players online at any given time I imagine not very often.
At least the penny-auction sites mask their costs by selling "stuff" - you're trying to sell money for the same kind of money which makes the scam easier to see. 
Profit is absolutely not a sin, profit exponentially larger than potential value at risk while asking your players to take a much riskier and less potentially profitable position is a scammy business model though.
@_date: 2012-07-30 15:11:30
Because deflationary currencies lead to earlier adopters seeing more advantage.  Some people, especially those who focus on "fairness" see this as a dealbreaker for pervasive adoption because that worldview sees that lower absolute conversion rate for late adopters as the reason why there will be no late adopters.
What this ignores is that as usage goes up, usability goes up because of the larger potential customer base, which is an incentive to be an "adopter", late or otherwise, all by itself.

Right, that's "the pitch".   Problem is, if you're not horribly incompetent at promoting the site it's easy to rope in at least a few dozen suckers and once you pass a very low threshhold for "critical bidder mass" the maximum profit achievable becomes a few percentage points, while the loss for every other participant is exponentially more than the value of the thing up for auction.
It's not that the game is unwinnable, it's just that the rewards for winning APPEAR worth the time but in reality simply by participating you lose.
Again though, I think you have some explaining to do as your first post in this thread acted like you were a player who had won, but in these later more detailed posts it sounds like you are part of the scam site in question.

Seems like the ability to short would exacerbate a crash, since anyone short has a direct financial incentive from the lowest possible price.
Really you can't expect much besides extreme volitility with such thin (few offers, few bids relative to other capital markets) volume.

Ultimately we're all betting that Bitcoin is going see much more pervasive adoption, as with "success" comes an inevitable upwards revaluation.   Buying bitcoin before that happens means you win, regardless of price.   Whether or not you get the most bang for your buck is another matter entirely.
If bitcoin goes to zero and dies (however unlikely that may be) it's just as unwise to be holding 100 bitcoins bought at $30/ea, or 10,000 bitcoins bought at $3/ea.   
So decide on the merits what you think will happen in this crazy world of ours, and buy accordingly.

If you want to automate bitcoin payments but don't want to hire a coder, you can use mtgox.com they have a payment button that can auto-sell recieved bitcoin for USD, although you shouldn't keep too much money in gox - Not secure.
The quick cheap secure way is just set up a wallet, do all transactions by email and use a different recieving address for every transaction.  If you do lots of small volume transactions that doesn't work, I'd suggest hiring a coder to work with the bitcoindaemon.

Thats not true Julian, Physical Bitcoins can be traded in meatspace as bitcoins unto themselves, since they protect the private key information with tamper evident seals, so long as the seal is intact the coin can be trusted to represent the advertised amount of money.
With a paper wallet, that's not true.  You need to use a computer or whatever to check what the balance is, and you need to transfer all the bitcoins out of it since the guy you're getting the paper wallet from will also have its private key information (having used it himself).

It's the good news/bad news about unregulated markets - Anybody can get into it, but not all players are good ones and it's often difficult to tell good from bad until it's too late. 
On the flip-side, I'm all in favor of not personally keeping any reasonable amount of value in the bitcoin markets - Buy 'em, put them on ice, and get them out when you want to buy something.  Hard for traders to play like that, but risk is the name of that game so go figure.

Everyone is too concerned with what you can buy, and is completely missing what you can sell!  People just need to start accepting BTC at existing stores, and selling existing products that were previously denominated in the local currency should have another price in BTC - The local price changes, the BTC price stays the same.   Most people will eventually choose to only transact in BTC, but by having the side by side exchange rates it a) shows even people who have not switched to BTC clearly what is happening to their currency relative a "stable" currency.
So the argument about al paca socks and drugs is moot, because the producers here have just as much incentive to switch to a stable currency as the consumers do.

Bottom line, as long as it continues to be so difficult to get US Dollars into BTC, Bitcoin will be "insulated" from US dollar effect, good or bad.
Combine that inability to bring in new funds to buy up newly generated bitcoins with the recent security debaccles and you've got the perfect storm for a major sell off in BTC that will keep going until its so cheap you'd be stupid not to buy it.

It's a voluntary system, if you want to pirate from it you can - The point is to make the costs reasonable so instead of taking the extra time to pirate, it's more attractive to pay a small fee and get to pick something that will work from a huge, diverse selection.    Would it make you feel better to think of it as a "convenience" fee?    
You also didn't respond to the subsidized idea - No or reduced charge, but somewhere on the thing you print would be a branding of some kind from the sponsor.  Since everything is 100% customizable, you could apply that model to literally anything and it would be a better value than conventional packaging advertising since 3d printed products are intended for re-use.  


And I guess that's the difference - I'm trying to work with the world we live in and you're trying to create something new out of whole cloth you've convinced yourself is the ideal.  That's great, I applaud your enthusiasm and your efforts, but you've made the perfect the enemy of the good.   
In your system, there are no protections for people who create new things, so the only people who will create new things under that system are people who are already wealthy enough to not need compensation for their time and labor.    Do you not believe people should be paid for the work they do?
It's easy to say "fuck the system, it's so stupid" but it's not actually very productive.    The things I propose could actually come to pass because the incentives line up for all groups, even people we now think of as pirates.   You claim it's unenforceable and miss the point that if I'm right, it won't require enforcement.   
When you buy a sandwich, did anyone show up and force you to buy that sandwich?  No,  you did it because you saw the value being offered for both the contents of the sandwich, the labor to create it, and the capital to finance the location so you could have a place to buy and eat that sandwich.   
My proposal is basically the same except it says "OK, because designs only need to be designed once, we can charge MUCH LESS per individual who thinks its a good value and wants to use it and over a longer period of time the designer (if people like their design) will be compensated for their work.   If people don't like their design, the designer gets nothing, but if people use their design as a jumping off point to make something that other people DO want than they get a portion of that compensation.     Forget for a moment you think this is unenforceable and tell me if you think it's a bad idea to compensate creators who make useful things?
 People who don't want to participate in the system DO NOT HAVE TO, I have said over and over it is VOLUNTARY, and that in my view a VOLUNTARY system with INCENTIVES that encourage people to participate for THEIR OWN BENEFIT is the only kind of system that can work.
What we have now is a coercive system backed up by the barrel of a gun and the rule of law.  What you propose is no rules

Haven't had occasion yet to use Gyft but it's vital in the "stopgap" toolkit.   Just like Bitpay itself is a company that once the big banks get involved, gets eaten by economies of Scale the same is true here.  Once you (+u/sgornick) can buy directly from those stores, you'll never use Gyft like you do now again.
 But in this interim period the opportunity for a company like Gyft is huge because for once they can capture the impulse-purchase market rather than the standard gift card market.
Its very cool to see thing crazy experiment continue to morph and change as we seek mainstream adoption.

At some point in this conversation you assumed I want to stop piracy, I don't. I don't care about piracy.  I want to give people a functional framework and set of standards that functionally eliminates the need for exclusivity in manufacturing relationships.  
Do you not understand how mutually beneficial systems work?  People do what they view to be in their best interest - Do you just hate the idea of any form of intellectual property, so you can't comprehend anyone being interested in protecting their creations in any way?
We're are talking about different systems - I'm talking about the system in use by the majority of creatives/designers (copyright, which lasts at least 70 years and patents which last at least 20 years) - You're talking about what some people are doing because they want their work to be shared more than they want to be paid.  You're talking about people who don't mind breaking laws they think are wrong, and acting like that's something scalable for society.
  **My proposal has nothing to do with people who already understand that copyright doesn't help, they can do whatever they want because they're not part of the problem.  I am not arguing with you on that point, we agree.**   
But while some people are attracted to a system like that, it offers no protection or means of compensation and (like it or not) people need to earn a living somehow.  My proposal is intended to be a compromise between protecting the real work people do to bring designs from their brain to a manufacturable state, while keeping the cost low to every day participants.
&lt;Never mind all that. Just answer me this: You do well understand that &lt;your plan will in no way at any point be followed on the hidden web, &lt;that there is no way at all to enforce your plan upon someone &lt;distributing designs through a Tor hidden server except to destroy &lt;the Tor network, and no way to destroy the Tor network except to &lt;destroy the internet entirely and allow no other future computer &lt;networks to emerge, right?? Do you understand this??
I am pro-tor, pro-privacy, pro-PGP, pro-bitcoin, the list goes on.  You keep acting like I'm your enemy and you just can't believe my words, but are you actually reading them?  
I would argue most pirates are pirates because the cost to not be a pirate is too high.  You said this yourself in an earlier comment, $1  is alot of money in some parts of the world.
There will always be free options, but the problem with free is there are no quality controls, so if you know your way around you might be able to find what you need but is that true for the average person?  
How many people use TOR? Why would you bother designing a system for subgroups who have no interest in participating?
The point is this: We have a system now, it's terrible and counterproductive
Would you rather sharing stay illegal? You say people share copyrighted material alreday, but you don't mention they expose themselves to lawsuits, criminal charges and not everybody has nothing to lose to download a model?   I'm not saying this is a good system, I'm saying its bad and we should replace it with something that could actually work.

Would you buy from one like this?  Do they associate the specific bitcoin transaction with all that information, and doesn't that mean they really can be tracked as they're spent?   
If someone 10 transactions down the line uses those bitcoins in something illegal and they're traced back to the ATM transaction, does that mean the person who bought them at the ATM gets asked where he spent them so the money can be followed?
I'm not afraid to associate my identity with the fact that I own and trade in Bitcoin, but I'm concerned about my potential liability for how someone else might spend bitcoins that were purchased by me at some point earlier in the future, because it's a point that identity and bitcoin are tied together

My integrity is what I have in this game. When we talk about things people know that we're telling them the truth as best we can figure it, and when we're wrong we admit it and correct.  
The reason we have opportunities like this is because we are obviously fair in our portrayal, and don't take bullshit answers with an "OK next question!"  that means that listeners know we're on their side, and interview subjects know they'll get fair treatment if they're doing right.  I don't view the exclusive as a benefit to us, it's the job, and it benefits them if they've been telling the truth about how Ripple operates for us to look at it and confirm that.  
I love what I do, but it is work and I take it very seriously.

For comparison, InsideBitcoins later this month is $399 for a shorter event
 and looks like it will be very well attended.
180 is pretty reasonable, it all just depends what your frame of reference is.  It's expensive to put on a conference and is definitely a speculative venture.  
@_date: 2013-06-01 05:16:00
It doesn't need to be revolutionary because it was early enough in the alt-coin arms race that it just had to be different enough from Bitcoin (hashing algorithm) that it's found decent adoption.
Now the next coin to find more "mainstream" adoption will have a higher bar than Litecoin did.
What part is disappointing?

Way too many projects, what I need is a development team that follows me around building projects from the random needs that become obvious over the course of each day living in the world of bitcoin.
A database is easy to monetize - you make a very high quality source of information, make it available to users on the site for free and available to other services and sites at a cost.   That game only works until someone else comes along and offers it for free.

What do you mean?
@_date: 2013-04-02 15:46:11
I actually disagree with this  - I think this is an EXCELLENT thing for people who got into bitcoin early (sub $10) to give their favorite articles .01BTC tips.
If you cost basis is $10, it costs you $.10 to give a $1 tip at current prices.  I'm not suggesting early adopters go drop half their coins, but if lots of people devoted 1 bitcoin to this think of how many new-to-bitcoin writers could be introduced to a feedback mechanism that actually pays?
@_date: 2013-04-03 02:19:27
Another nice thing would be if this could be output in a forum friendly format, then people writing major posts could add it to their posts.
It could also be used to visibly gauge how much the community wants a project to happen with the total donation amount clearly shown, it could be a mini-kickstarter.

Did you think our interview with Charlie was unfair or biased one way or the other? 
We discuss scammy practices (like pre-mining) not scammy coins.
The funny part is, we also get heat from people who think we're too much in favor of non-bitcoin chains :)   I just did an interview today with Peter, the lead dev on Feathercoin and we've got more alt-coins creators coming up in the lineup.
so, I think we have been exploratory, inclusive, we have expressed hope for alt coins and seen them as valid parts of a diverse ecosystem. We've also spoken bluntly about those that are "me too", not innovative and mostly pre-pumped.
Thanks for listening!

Why should the discussion of changes that affect us all be restricted to the code development forum?

Although it's closed source, one of our technical writers has been granted access to it and is writing an analysis piece about it, should be out in the next two weeks - there's a bit to go through.
Ripple is not what we're considering a scam-coin - You may not like it, I may not like it, but it actually performs a useful function as described in the interview I did with David Schwartz in episode 7 
We're focused on coins that serve absolutely no purpose beyond being easy to mine, and thus tempting to pump and dump.

It can't be manipulated like a centralized currency, but it can be attacked like a market raid.   Especially since at only 1 billion USD market cap it's pocket change for the interested parties, and there is no regulation so they don't need to do much to cover their tracks.

It's not in the current roadmap because all wallets automatically select which bitcoins you're transacting.  Is this specific to buying and selling on exchanges? 
The idea was as a fairly simple, inexpensive service for people to use with their wallets.  Are there additional problems that active traders face that would justify a different approach to the niche?
@_date: 2013-03-29 01:55:43
I would argue every user scared away by a short term bubble bursting is a battle Bitcoin lost.   The value that person would have brought to the network is now locked outside at least until they become more tempted than they are scared.

By all means, pillory the unpaid volunteers working on the foundations boards instead of talking to the people who can actually change things like that.  Marco is a member who has taken on extra responsibilities, he has nothing to do with the website.

And organized decentralization has a meaning, which I've explained in other answers since apparently it's hard for people to understand.  It seemed pretty simple to me,

Just so we're clear, because I've defended Elizabeth now that the first round of voting has settled and people are slinging mud at the candidate who came out on top, you're going to think less of LTB?
I asked before and didnt see an answer - Do you think I've abused the platform I've built with LTB to further the candidate I think is the best fit?

This seems quite close to what I'm looking for, but you seem to be entirely lacking a user interface besides the total amount - Can your code be modified to be a presented in a way that is more iconic and descriptive?  
I think it's important to share metrics like how many transactions overall contributed to the tipping for a given story because it encourages tipping for a variety of reason (Because nobody has tipped, because not enough people have tipped, because everybody buy you has tipped, etc.)  
Every reader can determine in their head if a fair amount of value has been given for the article they just read, and if the equation seems out of balance to them they can contribute.

Right, and after someone loses 90% in stocks, they generally don't reinvest into stocks again.  They stay away from them.

So they told you nothing about anything related to the product, but they showed up so you had a conversation with someone at the company about some tangentially related technology issues.   
And also you work with the same payment processor as them, who processed and **took a cut of all pre-order payments...  Amazingly, the payment processor thinks they've got a good system,** which makes sense as they've already profited from it.
Yeah, that doesn't seem like any sort of conflict of interest.  Thanks for keeping a skeptical eye about yourself lol.

@_date: 2013-09-10 23:45:17
I don't think they talked about the size of tips.  The comment was "Flair for tippers" 
The tipping is the hard part, size matters not.
And completely open sites like reddit prove that some people *are* more special than others.  Those who contribute to the community consistently should be rewarded with inconsequential social feedback like flair because it encourages people to follow their lead.
So long as we give flair for things we want to incentivize, it can be a useful tool.   If it is applied based on some arbitrary standard it is meaningless and counterproductive.

Hey Gavin,
Are there any plans to do any outreach or communication before you make changes like this?   The block size issue for example, will you be writing an article or doing any sort of community Q&amp;A about why this is important, and the right move forward?
I think the problem has not been the changes, but the fact that they keep being "discovered" with no seeming input or explanation outside of the highly technical ones present in the github discussion?
If you're willing, I'd like to have you on [Let's Talk Bitcoin!]( to talk about it - adam
**Any time there is one of these "important but political from some perspective" development moves, I would be happy to immediately run (breaking our Tuesday/Friday release schedule) a Development Update where you or other devs can explain the proposed change, and why it should be important to the community to implement.**  
**My interview style is "Ask the obvious questions", which I think would work well here as we can potentially address common misconceptions**
**I really feel like the Dev needs to get ahead of this communication problem - People are starting to react faster and faster to little changes because they don't understand them, and they're not being explained it's just happening.   This is not a hostile process, we're all stakeholders.  It's just that information needs to be shared**

Let's Talk Bitcoin has always been designed, and presented as a platform so to a certain extent the guests we bring on are a function of me stumbling across them, or them approaching us on the topic.  
We have talked about Namecoin before, but none of the hosts are experts on the topic, and I can't find anybody to represent the project on-air so that presents a major problem.
Do you have any suggestions for projects we should be looking at, or people we should be talking to?

Yep, this is the correct answer.  MPESA can exist because they are a monopoly provider blessed by the government who recently enabled them to apply a 10% tax to all transactions using the network.  Can't do this with Bitcoin, and the only cell phone network would actively lose from any introduction of Bitcoin, so it won't happen.

You're assuming that because something is available elsewhere, everybody will use it -  But everyday  life shows us that's not true, people get used to resources that prove to be useful and that work for their needs.  
 If the cost increases beyond a level they're comfortable with, they might look elsewhere for the same products but barring price *increases* people tend to be happy with the resources that satisfy their needs rather than constantly looking for the absolute rock bottom price.     
The original supports designers, the pirated sites take the content those designers create and then sell it themselves without compensating the designers - But how do people know about the site selling the content for $.01?  Where does the money come from to advertise when there is no margin above the nominal cost of production?
Again, i'm not saying that EVERY SINGLE PERSON will use the legimate version, i'm saying that enough people will use the legitimate version because it supports the designers and the continued production of stuff they want that the people who take the content without payment don't matter.  They were never going to buy it anyways.

Right, I'm not sure how much better that option is compared to dealing with a centralized exchange.  Sure you avoid some risk, but you add new ones and your financial identity is still out there - just with the guy at the other side of the trade instead of an institution whose job it is to keep that data secure.
I think decentralized exchanges have a bright future ahead of them, not convinced bootstrapping automation onto OTC is the answer.

If we assume that every address used will be a new address specifically created for that articles tip jar, you could have it display the total received rather than the total remaining in the account.
But that doesn't fix the buskar problem of simply changing the address unless there is some sort of timestamp that displays the date the first tip was received by that address.
Also, lots of content gets republished across the web - It would be easy to change out the bitcoin address of the original author for one you own - Maybe a system where you sign the tip jar with your private key in order to generate the address, and the verification is displayed on the widget?

Did you see that the article asks if the Authorized Participant  (AP) could possibly facilitate redemptions for the individual investor (i.e. not the trust)?  Is that possible?
You would have to have an aggregate of 50,000 shares redeemed by the Authorized Participant ..if say they had
50 individual investors each with 1000 redemptions
Maybe there could be an additional lower minimum redemption threshold set by the AP? 
Would it be possible somehow for the AP to get the Bitcoins to the retail investor?

Comment from Cypherdoc on BitcoinTalk 
the thing you're missing Adam is proving that which is stolen from that which is allegedly stolen.
i could donate 100 BTC to your podcast today.  you might happily then spend that BTC immediately on needed expenses for production and expansion.  i could then come to you a month later and ask you for special favors related to advertising my business.  you would rightly decline from an ethical standpoint.  the disagreement escalates and then i go public accusing you of stealing my 100 BTC via a hack.  after all, i have the private key from the donation address proving it came from me to you.
how can anyone prove who's right?  should those coins be tainted forever?  and should your suppliers be able to ask you to repay with non tainted coins as a result?
I agree, there isn't any way to do this without making subjective judgements that someone is right and someone is wrong, which makes it very difficult to do anything without risking harm to an innocent party.

Because off-chain transaction services are inherently centralized, have counterparty risk and are no longer trustless.
If you had the choice of using Bitcoin sacrificing those features vs. an altcoin that would be officially adopted by the region, heavily marketed to its inhabitants and that is frictionless in conversion to any other cryptocurrency (like bitcoin) why wouldn't you keep savings in Bitcoin and conduct transactions in the local, application specific version?

The "no arbiter or guardian but the blockchain and complete transparency" is compelling to me, which not even openid can match.  
To the kids question:
Kid don't get credit cards, but they are often trusted with cash.  With cash the most they can lose is what they have, so it seems very reasonable to assume if Bitcoin becomes the gold standard for online transactions, and they're allowed to go online, they'll be trusted with "cash" (a very small amount of bitcoin) which is enough to give them an identity, which they can then improve over time through proper civic behavior.
Honestly it sounds a little draconian, but so long as it's all voluntary  it just becomes a community standard.
Right now the barrier to entry is that bitcoin is new and scary, in three  years that's not going to be the case - If it's not illegal, it will be ubiquitously accepted online because it is genuinely advantageous to merchants who accept it.
Frankly I think this could be a killer-app to bootstrap bitcoin adoption and make the world a more spam free place.

This is semantic.  From Jon Matonis on down to Elizabeth, they use the word "Chapter" in the same way one might use the word "Cell".  Each is an autonomous unit aligned around the same set of broad objectives, sometimes sharing means and motives but not necessarily.

Depends on the VC, they might be running an incubator and view this as a cheap entry point to an innovative space.  
Alternatively, they could view the potential of the service and brand as warranting that level of investment if it fits into their broader strategy in the space.
Only way to tell is to find out, and +1 on the getting advice when money enters the picture - The best thing to do is start talking to people who have navigated the waters of Startup before - you want to do this well before signing contracts or selling equity, and you'll want to have several different individuals so you can get a variety of perspectives.

You're saying people won't take advantage of a system that has no rules, and that's absurd.

It's the difference between a flea market and a store - The flea market has no standards and might have great stuff but also has lots of crap  you have to sift thorugh to find the deals, whereas the store is incentivized to only offer things for sale they think their customers will buy.

The transaction fees are only "high" because they were set as a fixed value when the currency was worth $1/ea - I'll be surprised if we don't see them move the decimal once the new value stabilizes, which would move the fee from .005btc (50 cents at 100/coin) to .00005btc (half a penny at $100 per coin)
I'd call that growing pains more than a strategic choice

See, I don't think you understand how this works - If most people hold their coins, the only coins that will be available for people to buy will be those not being held. 
 That creates a smaller subpool in the "total number of Bitcoins ever created" that is "total number of bitcoins available to buy at the current price"
It is **that smaller pool** that provides the supply to match whatever the demand is, and so if that pool is small until we hit 5,000 than that'll be the price we start thinking about stabilizing at.     But that's why it doesn't matter if people hoard, it reduces the supply which causes the price to go up even faster.   
The only way you'll see a crash is if a bunch of people decide to unload at once, which could plausibly happen - But the buy very large walls have been moving right along with the price, I think it's in the $110 USD range right now.
If someone with 10% of the bitcoins available for trade dumps them all on the market at once and walks away, not buying the dip then we could see a cascading panic out, but barring that kind of event I just don't see it how that works?
To your second point - Bitcoins are unstable right now because they're revaluing in complete free market price discovery mode.  **I do not think anyone should spend or commit bitcoins at this point unless they have a lot of them already.  If  you're a bitcoin millionaire, I encourage you to sell 2/3rds of your holdings on the way up wherever you feel comfortable.   **  It is very useful as money on the internet, so even if people just use it for that and never hold it outside an immediate transaction they still benefit from it existing in a pervasive fashion.  It means any business can be an international business without going through currency exchanges, among many other things.
Once we hit the equilibrium point, the market will get stable again as it's been in the past - Boring.   Exactly what is needed for commerce to be conducted, with a huge amount of value being redistributed into a very technically literate 1%
Frankly that's good for everybody, I'm writing an article right now (hopefully for MAKE) entitled *The New Renaissance - How CryptoMillionaires can change the world for the better*
That puts this forward:










As an uncompensated writer, I take tips.  I sold most of my coins at 35 and had less than 100 to begin with, been in the currency for two years :/

@_date: 2013-06-24 00:26:15
That's an interesting take
@_date: 2013-04-02 13:33:57
This is correct - One of my wallets has about 15 addresses in it right now, each one named after the place it's embedded. 
 So when I received 3 tips for .01btc in the last 12 hours, I get notified which address its coming in from and then it's added to the pot with everything else that can be spent.  That is a great feedback mechanism over a long period of time because I'll be able to tell which of my articles is resonating best, even over the long term.
I think "charging a fee" is a model some people will follow, but it's like putting up a less onerous paywall - Even if you earn more money, it's at the expense of your reader numbers overall.   Much better to embrace the voluntary nature of Bitcoin, put our best work out there and say "If you like what I'm doing, please support"
@_date: 2013-01-13 16:57:32
I don't really see how that's possible unless you're making a very large investment in new mining hardware.  If they had released before the number dropped to 25btc/block, you might have been right but the reality is that drop vanished any potential profit you might have made.
Faster mining is only an advantage if you have it while most other participants are still using old tech - BFL has, by pre-selling as much as possible for a long period of time and repeatedly missing release dates ensured that nearly anyone in the mining space who is going to buy a unit has already done so.
Bottom line is instead of there being an advantage for buying the hardware before everyone else, instead the advantage is to those who got their pre-order in earliest and will recieve one of the earlier shipments.  Even in those cases, the advantage is only as big as the delay in the supply chain which should be minor once full-scale production starts.
Good luck with that

I think anything that wants your bitcoins up front for something you'll get later is probably a mistake.  If Bitcoin winds up crashing tomorrow I'll be wrong, but in the long term we're on an upward trend.

The foundation is shifting gears to focus on a legal defense fund to "keep people out of jail", de-emphasizing the US and turning it into just another chapter of a global franchise-lite model, defensive intellectual property re: trademarks, basic patents etc, and expanding their utility grant program.
What exactly is your problem with them?  I hear you saying that they haven't done anything for Bitcoin, but they did put on a very successful conference and now they have a pretty solid plan that sounds like it will actually help being pushed forward by a guy who I believe can pull it off.

If they outlaw exchanges, we'll move from a centralized exchange system (Mt. Gox, Bitfloor, etc. each their own kingdom of commerce) to a decentralized system like bitcoin-otc.   
Centralized is easy, especially when there aren't very many users.   De-centralized takes more effort, but it's impossible to destroy.   Right now the only way to apply pressure to Bitcoin is by attacking Gox without destroying it. 
Bitcoin is already taxable like a commodity, it's just unenforceable.
The problem with Gold is it's not very divisible or transmittable.  Bitcoin transmutes those problems into advantages -  Anywhere the internet reaches it will be easy to use Bitcoins.

I like how you specify "pure communism", which has never existed in real-life as a point of comparison against Bitcoin which actually does exist, and now rather than fictional-historically.
"Pure Communism" would be an opt-out system, where to opt-out you move (if allowed) out of a pure communist state.  By contrast, Bitcoin is an opt-in system where in order to participate you take a look at the rules of the system and make a judgement call if you want to participate.  If that changes for whatever reason at any time, you can take your Bitcoins and change them into either another cryptocurrency or a local currency.
Try to do this with a communist system and you'll find you have nothing except whatever you can carry.
And of course, in *real* communism, it is the ruling elite who rule because they control the resources of the broader collective, supposedly acting for the good of the land in much the same way the pope interprets and acts upon the will of god.  
Bitcoin has problems, but the fact that it is opt-in and rules-based, requiring pro-active change from a majority in order to spur change for anyone means that little ever changes, and what does is so bland and boring that it can be supported universally.

Honestly I didn't even think about the traffic from that, I haven't been focused on the site this week and it didn't occur to me I just didn't know what else to put.
We aren't really targeted at people who don't know what Bitcoin is, there are other sites on the internet for that.  We're very beta and my attention is distracted by various projects and getting the audio show out twice a week.

I identified myself so the context of my response would be understood.  Both because I have worked with Elizabeth on projects in the past, and because you were poking at the style in which debate responses were given.  
I don't think I'm well enough known to be able to comment without identifying my qualifications.
As to the association between my position and my opinion, wouldn't it be more troublesome if I believed these things but did not share that publically?  When I have a microphone, I am performing a service I have voluntarily undertaken and paid both in time and money to do so.  My personal sense of ethics means that I keep personal to personal, and public to public.   
Reddit, to this point at least, has been personal.   Should I not post here, or perhaps get a different username?
I have to say I take a bit of offense at the contention I'm not allowed to explain my qualifications and voice my opinion on matters that directly impact me in a community I devote my life to.

But we're talking about the real world, and that's not really an option at this point.   
If the question is Bitcoin becoming big enough to challenge the reserve status of your currency (which is the only reason you're able to print as much as you want with no impact on the value), or devoting a few billion USD to the goal of making it a repeating newbie trap

While it's obvious there have been more places accepting bitcoins, if you take a look at the largest bitcoin auction site (bitmit.net) you'll see hardly any items listed there actually sell.

Because I'm a dues-paying member of the foundation.
I volunteered my time and expertise to arrange and produce a candidate debate because I was unhappy with the lack of coverage the election was getting, and wanted to learn more about the candidates.
I encourage you to listen to the debate and point out any actions I took you feel demonstrate bias or might sway the listener unfairly towards one candidate or another.
Do you feel I do not have the right to express my personal opinion on a reddit thread? LTB Listeners will know I have not used the show in any way to help one candidate over another.
In politics there is a temptation to badmouth the frontrunner because you'd rather they not be the front runner. That's fine, but it doesn't change the facts. Elizabeth did the most outreach, was the most responsive, and the results showed the efficacy of her efforts. Am I wrong?

Yeah I agree, that is disappointing.  But it's something to think about, there are real costs to using a lot of Cryptocurrencies, and until one blanket client comes along that makes it easy to add new altcoins to it, it places a limit on the number of different coins the average person is likely to use.  For me the number is 2 or 3, I actually had the feathercoin client I was trying out crash my computer and cause the loss of about an hours editing work (my fault, didn't save often enough).  Point is, I can't even imagine how many issues I'd have were I running 10+ altcoin clients.
   And I agree with you about the downvoting, people confuse statements they disagree with, with statements that are not worthwhile.   We have an ongoing thread at BitcoinTalk that is updated every new episode, and it gets a fraction of the comments that reddit gives.   
Ultimately we want to connect with listeners, so we try to be everywhere in the community for however people want to find us.

Maybe I'm wrong, but it seems like Devs are experts at development rather than at promotion and media relations.   
Also, is there no middle ground between "Devs decide in a closed room only github users can participate in" and getting the vote of every single bitcoin user?    
Decisions are one thing, but there was never even a thread made asking for people with media relations experience and bitcoin expertise to contact them for consideration. 
After all, that's my favorite way to pick the most suitable candidate for a job - Get together people I'm already friends with who share my idealogical viewpoint and then pick from that handful of people.

Thank you,
In the comments on the article I mention another example - Nilam Doctor is currently creating an altcoin for the region of Marikesh.  Bitcoin does not suit them because the transaction fees are too high relative to the average transaction locally, so rather than try to shoe-horn into Bitcoin he is working with the government to create an officially recognized local cryptocurrency.
That's a totally new market, so the "Is it better than bitcoin" question never even comes into play.   
The problem most people have is they assume the only people who will be interested in Altcoins are those already interested in Bitcoins.  The opportunity of Alt-Coins broadly speaking, is in the other 99.99%

It's not my chapter, I was quoted in the local paper and they approached me to speak.   I was asked to speak for 20ish minutes, this is intended as an introduction for older affluent people who have never heard of bitcoin or why they would even want a different kind of money.
@_date: 2013-09-29 16:24:18
Having Bitcoin power their system would mean they're merely a participant in a larger economy rather than a gated experiance where their play money interfaces with the rest of the world.  Listen to Gabe speak about this last year, Valve doesn't want to have walled gardens, bitcoin enables them to do that while accepting users from any internet connected country, which is very much unlike a paypal system.   By using Bitcoin as a protocol rather than running something themselves, they have zero liability for the actions of the currency.   Totally inclusive, with no work required on their part.
What about Bitcoin needs to be fixed?  More advanced payment methods are coming out, you can see our implementation of the Bitcredits System at

21 million is an arbitrary number, but the fact that it is the definitive number is telling.
Bitcoin has something that virtually no other currency does - A slow, predictable, unchangable rate of issuance.   
If all the coins were given out right at the beginning, it would have meant that anyone getting involved now would only have the option of buying them rather than earning them by participating in the system.  
The whole advantage of a distributed system is that there are many many participants spread over as large and diverse an area as possible, so that even if half the world were to suddenly vanish it would only be a minor blip, not even a disruption to the operation of the system as a whole.
21 Million started off as a really big number, but when you apply it against the potential usage figures it becomes obvious what it is - A lighthouse of opportunity for anyone who sees the system and appreciates the potential, broadcasting:
It is in  your best interest to get into this right now, because the sooner you do the greater the potential reward will be.
Once we've passed this time of opportunity, and people have seen success we'll switch to the other arguement - Stable prices make it safe to transact, and even if you're transacting in a tiny fraction of a bitcoin, you still get the advantages of p2p, verifiable, pseudonymous transactions without the profit motive.

Right, pegging to the dollar is a way to remove the exchange risk of bitcoin crashing in value and you being stuck with an asset worth only 10% of what was paid.  Now if Bitcoin crashes, they get 10x the amount of Bitcoin but it comes at the cost of getting less bitcoin should the price go up.
It's a conservative move, and makes sense from the real estate sector.
@_date: 2013-06-17 05:26:23
Under what circumstances could they be made to have no choice?  There is one monopoly cell phone service who is in bed with the government, has complete control of their network and all traffic on it, and would lose their ability to extract 1-10% in transfer fees from all transactions that take place on their network.
If you have a real scenario in mind where the infrastructure could be made available to provide an alternative to this situation, I'm happy to discuss.   Having looked at the situation, I don't see any outcome here but more of the same.

Not getting rich does not equal "has no responsibilities to keep to their agreement"
They demanded payment up front, 100% - At least 40% of which is profit margin.   If they were not clear on their launch schedule, they should not have taken 100% pre-orders for promised launch windows they might not potentially meet.
**If at the point they missed the window, they offered refunds they would have saved themselves the trouble of having this currency mismatch, but as company policy they did NOT offer this, even after it was clear.**
So really, while you may be right about the bitcoin value relative to the date of pre-order, it seems like the value as of October (the latest release date mentioned prior to blowing it) should be the refund value - **It's where I would have requested one, in bitcoin, if I hadn't been disallowed by BFLs policy.**
@_date: 2013-04-06 04:07:22
Actually I disagree - It will be a disruption for sure, but why  would getting paid in a more efficient, better suited money for the internet *create* more poor people?  
Did people starve because credit cards went mainstream?  seems like this doesn't really impact that. in order for the "fiat money system" to collapse, it has to be underutilized... which means people stop using it... which means those people are using something else.... get it?
The only person it's bad for is the guy who gets to print dollars - now less people want them so he'll have to stop printing before nobody wants them.  Shitty products perform poorly against cheaper, better competitors.

1 -Andreas is scheduled with Amir Taaki, who is working on a current implementation of CoinJoin
2 - I have an interview with Alan on Monday about Armory, we've been waiting for their funding to complete.
3 - That's a good idea
4 - I don't know what this is, why should I care?
5 - We actually try not to put too much of our own projects into the show, we just talked about his book recently is there something specific you would want to know?
6 - Andreas has two on order, we were waiting to see hardware before pulling in the participants but we did talk about hardware wallets briefly in the upcoming episode I think next Tuesday
7 - Glad you liked it, I'm waiting for an article from Sneak for the blog and intend to use that as the excuse to interview him again.  I love the warrior philosopher poet thing some black hats have going on.
8 - We're supposed to do the interview in September but it's been hard to schedule.
9 - Is Sipa a person or a project?
10 - The % of their total business in Bitcoin?  Sure, that sounds plausible for an interview
11 - We just had Gavin on like three weeks ago, I like to put some distance between appearances - Anything specific you think Gavin should be weighing in about?
12 - Why?  What exactly do you want to know from Coinbase?  I use their service and don't have many questions, seems like a straightforward and infrastructure level service with the big innovation being their relationships that allow connections to bank accounts.
13 - I have a 10 minute interview with Sam from KNC miner running in the next one or two shows
14 - I know Stephanie wants to catch up with Mike Hearn again, good idea.
15 - I have a 50 minute show he did with Stephanie and Davi of BitcoinNotBombs that we'll be running at some point, the context of it was Satoshi Forest.
16 - Amusingly, I don't feel that strongly about this and I don't think any of the other hosts do either.  I've been wanting to incorporate more interactive debates into the actual show since we did that one for the foundation, this might be a good opportunity to do so.  Can you suggest some outspoken voices on either side of the issue?  It won't happen until mid october but I think a debate about the blocksize issue could be useful.
17 - Good idea, haven't spoken with him since the conference.
18 - Don't we do that frequently?   Do you mean more formal?  I guess we could have an Austrian and a Keynesian in a live debate format or something.
19 - I'm sitting down with Jeffrey the day after CCC in Atlanta, good topics I'm planning it to be wide-ranging.
20 - The altcoin topic is tough, if we bitch about them people complain, if we say nice things about them people complain.  We've had that exact conversation before, and have one on an upcoming show asking what our criteria should be for accepting new altcoins for donation since we do get asked fairly often by people wanting to donate in something we don't accept.

I run Let's Talk Bitcoin, a twice weekly show about cryptocurrencies.  I'm working on new project called tax my bitcoins, that basically takes your wallet output and gives you cost-basis information in your local currency on both transactions and fee amounts.  
When running the show wallet which has about 400 transactions in and out (mostly in) I discovered we pay between 4 and 6 cents per fee paying transaction, and that over the last 5 months we've paid $1.86 in fees based on the exchange rate at the time the fee was paid.
The fee right now is an artificial "default" number, it is intentionally moved down as the price goes up and stabilizes,  eventually that will be removed.   Fees are no big deal and I don't see that changing in the near future, it's just hard to know because we're talking about many decimal places.

Why would it be inevitable?  You said it yourself,the boom bust cycle - They can enact that with Bitcoin really at will up until they can't create enough dollars to buy the amount of required bitcoins.
How big does bitcoin have to be for that to happen, a trillion dollar market cap?  I mean, right now we're printing 65 billion a month to prop up mortgage backed securities.   Especially since in practice the amount of bitcoins trading relative to the amount being held or lost is quite small.

I would like to add an address for every coin because we're making something that takes time and sweat here, and however people want to give us value is fine with me.   I am all about being inclusive.
 The problem is, real world logistics get in the way of having that stance.   We just received a 100LTC donation, which is worth about 300usd, so that seems like a channel we'll probably keep open.  But before that happened I was getting flak from my business partners because it's another capital gains stream that has to be monitored for tax disclosure purposes.
No good answer here, so instead we're just who we are, and call it like we see it.

I'd suggest talking to them to see what they're interested in.
Do not mention ANY numbers, but ask them for their estimates at what you would need to scale.  
When you start something not really thinking of it as a "startup" alot of times you get minimum-operating costs in your head that are so wrong it's not even funny.  If they're seriously interested in you chances are good they'll be thinking of numbers several orders of magnitude above what you are, and by letting them set the initial expectation you'll do MUCH better in negotiations than if you tell them what you think it should cost.

There is no crisis, I'm not sure why you've put that in quotes.   The topic of conversation is "What is the point of mining, and what are the incentives supposed to incentivize - is it the maximum hashing rate (the largest number), or the most decentralized system.  Most people I've spoken to agree that since the power in the network is normalized on a regular basis, that beyond a certain minimum power to sustain operation on the network the number becomes meaningless.  
It's not that only a few people will afford asics, but rather that a much smaller amount can afford asics RELATIVE to how many can afford general purpose CPUs.   In that way, an asic-dominated mining future is a neccesarily more centralized one because people will only buy ASIC hardware if they want to mine.  This is compared to everyone who has a computer also has a CPU, and if CPUs were the standard for mining instead of being too slow to compete you'd have millions of non-specialized miners participating in the system and creating a MUCH more robust network comparatively.

Elizabeth's platform of organized decentralization means she thinks the foundation should provide a toolkit and best practices to local chapters big or small.   What exactly do you disagree about that?  It would be better to have the Bitcoin Foundation be an organization dictating what subsidiaries should do?   Elizabeth has a platform out there for everyone to see, it's easy to spew generalities, is there actually something you disagree with?  
And the appeal of Elizabeth's washington experiance is actually exactly BECAUSE it was so brief.  She is not an insider, she is a passionate individual who has several years of experiance to understand how the system works without the biases and assumptions present with someone entirely new to the process.  Elizabeth has advocated educating representatives and regulators, do you think it is bad to give correct information and take the time to explain to people who ultimately will make laws?
I really challenge you to find a single instance of someone saying "OMG She's a former congresswoman VOTE VOTE VOTE"
I have a lot of respect for the members of this community, we're all very skeptical of what might come from regulators and we do our homework.  Elizabeth did the best job of reaching out to members of the foundation, explaining her position, soliciting feedback, and the results showed the impact of that work.

I can see a country that falls apart as a result of government incompetence, with serial failures and replacements like we've had for years in Japan, Greece, Spain, etc. eventually getting so tired of being lied to that they elect someone on the platform of using Bitcoin as an anti-corruption backing of a newly issued local currency.
a Bitcoin standard has all the advantages of a gold standard plus the ability to be verifiable and auditable by anyone connected to the internet, whereas Gold has to be kept locked away from sight which allows for abuses by those who are charged with protecting and accounting for it.
Will this happen because politicians want it to?  No.  It'll happen because people stop electing politicians and bother to elect a government that comes from outside the political system and is mandated by the people to legitimately fix the problem.  This type of arrangement could actually do that.

Couple of ways 
1 - Computer had wallet unencrypted, DEA were savvy and transferred it to an address they controlled as mentioned in the report
2 - Computer had an encrypted wallet, DEA convinced the perp to send them anyhow
3 - (my best guess) - DEA opened a store on Silk Road and sold illegal product, then when a sucker came along who used his real address they mark the payment as a "confiscation" and arrest upon reciept of the package

* Amazon or Google accepting Bitcoin for services rendered would be a big step forward
* Amazon or Google offering to pay their affiliates/contractors in Bitcoin would change the game
* A small country leaves the euro, reissuing their local currency with a combined backing of physical gold and Transparent Bitcoin.
It will stop being a stock when as many people who want to own or use bitcoins are able to do just that.  The supply in inflexible so the price must keep rising until enough people feel like there is good value to be had at the current exchange rate.

It solves the problem Bitcoin has with centralized exchanges by building in a trustless on-blockchain escrow system that acts as a decentralized p2p exchange for any currency pairs.
It incorporates an improved, recoded version of the Bitmessage protocol which allows for encrypted p2p "email" type messaging, but also insant-messaging in the same way as Crypto.cat
It incorporates an identity management system that lets you use public addresses as an identity token to login on websites that integrate that feature.  This is appealing to the websites because it means they don't have to house financial or identity information, but can still have verifiable and reputation based identities participate in their community. 
It incorporates a DNS style naming system that lets you assign human readable names to the aforementioned public addresses so instead of a 30 character long alphanumeric, I could be AdamBLevine and it would properly route.   Note this is not mandatory, so if you dont want to have a real name, or you want multiple identities you can do that with this.
It also has futures markets and commodities markets built into it, but I don't understand how those work well enough to explain it.
It also uses a rotating blockchain so instead of the download getting larger and larger and larger as time passes, it stays at a fixed maximum size.
It also has a proof of work algorithm that is HEAVILY biased towards CPUs, does not work well on GPUs and is designed to be extremely inefficient in ASICs due to the memory requirements.  This means more people can mine it with their existing hardware and it'll make sense for longer.
And most importantly, it's built from fresh code with a specific goal of extreme intuitive usability rather than focusing on functionality and assuming people will figure it out.   Altcoins built off of Bitcoin have all the legacy issues Bitcoin does, this fresh code approach gets entirely around that.

Stop believing things that sound too good to be true, especially with regards to mining.
  If you look at a publicly available deal on the web and say to yourself "Man! I'll make a ton of money with that!" than probably a whole lot of other people are doing the same thing.
With a normal market pre-orders are OK because when things inevitably go wrong the consequences are annoying but not actually detrimental.  With Mining it's a whole different story.  
So the next time you think about buying mining equiptment, think about it like you're pre-ordering a state of the art computer... But the more people who buy the computer, the worse yours will perform and in fact once faster computers come out days weeks or months later, they will make your computer much slower.
In an environment like that, does it make more sense to pre-order a really fast computer, or to buy something available that you know will be outdated before too long.   Or maybe you don't even want to buy a computer in that environment.  
Mining in this exponential environment is **insane** and anyone choosing to get into it should strap on their helmet.
As to what BITCOIN as a protocol should do about it, nothing.  Escrow services are available, and more will become available as the need is obviously pronounced.  Would that have saved people from BFL?  Probably not.  
Ultimately it is the vendor who gets to pick what the terms are when it comes to pre-orders, and clearly BFL needed the money to develop their hardware, so escrow until delivery would have been the same thing as not achieving funding at all.
@_date: 2013-03-29 01:35:55
Also it's important to note you can't attack Bitcoin on it's merits because that would mean you'd be comparing it against the dollar, and when compared against the dollar as anything other than a bubble it's a bad showing for the dollar.    
So talking about it really is not in your best interest, better to just be a (very large) participant in the market and operate in the way that best meets your requirements.  It's not even illegal, just a dick move.

Actually, Cyprus could sell euros for Bitcoin, then issue a new paper currency backed by reserves of Bitcoin.  And unlike in a gold reserve system, the vault is totally transparent and accessible from the web to ensure nobody is gaming the system.
It would be incredible to live in a system making that conversion, but all bitcoin price volatility would become meaningless in a few days.

Have you ever seen the chart of a market bubble before?   
They take a while to get going, eventually going exponential then parabolic, and then when the bubble bursts EVERYBODY gets out at once, all the people who were buying before are now selling trying to lock in that profit you mentioned and since the price looks like it'll go down forever there are very few people interested in "catching a falling knife".  
So while greed is good, it's also good to have a reasonable rate of increase because it means people have reasonable expectations.
The folks buying bitcoins at $90 are doing it because they think they'll be worth $200 soon enough at the rate their going - If the price drops to $50 I bet you most of them get real nervous and decide to take the loss they know than risk the loss they were wrong and the whole thing falls apart.
And in the game we're playing, that's the outcome I (the central bank) want, so I win.

Disagree - Not about complication, it's that the people who have the ability to bring about this change actively lose power from doing so.

It recovered because the federal government has been shoveling money at banks who otherwise wouldn't be participating in the market for all the bad assets they can't sell.   Currently the number is 65 billion dollars a month buying mortgage backed securities.  
By exchanging bad assets for real dollars, those firms then take the money to the stock market and invest in... whatever....   It doesn't matter because that much new money shifting out of Mortgage backed Securities and into the stock market keeps it moving up.
Bitcoin doesn't have that - And central banks will encourage people to get OUT of bitcoin vs. the BUY BUY BUY advertisement machines dominating wallstreet think.  
They use this culture to rope in small money suckers who want to ride the ever-increasing wave, which is where we are now.
Bitcoin will survive crashes, but every crash that loses a newbie money is a newbie who won't be coming back to Bitcoin for some time, and when it comes up in conversation will say "Yeah, it's a scam"

I spent an hour on the phone with the Author and brought him up to speed as best I could.  There has been a 180 degree flip in how journalists are approaching Bitcoin in the last two months.  We've gone from "It's a ponzi scheme, there's no government backing it and hackers have probably already broken it" to legitimately attempting to understand it.
@_date: 2013-05-22 06:58:13
That's a really good point about mixing the coins before they're tainted, and given the speed at which that could be possible (fast enough to the point of being considered automated) it seems difficult to deal with.
Perhaps the solution is for legitimate mixer-services to not accept coins that have been transferred within the last say 2-7 days.   Shorter would work, but the less buffer you have the more likely the freeze hits  an innocent.

*Edit - I am the author of the article*
 
Replace the $1 price point with whatever you want, the point is to make the cost a marginal part of production, so modify the number to whatever you think is appropriate. Keep in mind though that if you drop compensation too low, you’ll get few participants as they won’t see things being worth their time.
And that’s kind of the point of my proposal – It’s not another “scheme” because a “scheme” relies on government enforced laws to make people follow the rules. What I tried to describe, and the only thing I really think could work is a system that is built on natural laws so that every group involved sees performance of their part as a reward unto itself. in our current IP reality a few people win, most people lose
**Current IP**: 
*Designer/Rightsholder* has the advantage of complete control of their IP for 20-70+ years,the right to charge whatever they want for any kind of licensing scheme they can think up, complete control of who, where and when it is manufactured. 
 
*Manufacturer*: Limited products to choose from, high costs but high profit potential because of limited competition 
 
*Consumer*: Limited options to choose from, most of the options are considered “good” because they wouldn’t even be available for sale if they hadn’t already passed alot of hurdles. Prices are highly variable since one rights-holder might value their product at a wildly different level. Material costs have very little to do with pricing since there is artificially limited competition at the manufacturer level, and prices stay “high” relatively speaking to allow manufacturers to recoup their investment.
 
**Proposed system**: 
*Designer* – Able to quickly move from finished-design to saleable-product, no need to invest in infrastructure. This allows the designer to move on to the next project very quickly, while putting the just-finished project up for sale immediately.
  
*Manufacturer* – No barrier to entry besides equiptment costs. Many products to choose from, no quantity commitment so you can test a product in your local market without any kind of contract or investment, ability to customize designs as a further value ad, direct connection to the customer instead of traditional retailer model. 
 
*Consumer*: Unlimited choices, one-stop shopping for many categories of consumer items (or order online), everything is customizable to your size or tastes, lower prices because there are more manufacturers competing for the same customers with the same database of designs.
**Which system would you, voluntarily, want to be a part of?** For me the answer is clear, and it’s also clear that the only system that can possibly work is one where people WANT to participate because they see it being in their own best interest.
 
As far as “no copyright is intended” people are absolutely welcome to do that, and I envision the proposed system having “free” designs as well. Also maybe ad supported designs “Free mug design! Customize it to your liking! *Must have 1″x1″ Starbucks logo somewhere on the mug when printed*
 
There are so many options, I just can’t see any of these problems being insurmountable – What else you got?

Hey there,
I'm the lead at Let's Talk Bitcoin and I conducted the debate.  
  Candidates were given the questions in advance, some of them chose to prepare some of them did not.   Elizabeth was very proactive and chose to prepare, which frankly is a valuable skill given the role. 
I've worked with Elizabeth periodically since about June and I just wanted to say that I think your comments are pretty inappropriate.  Candidates discuss their beliefs and attributes, and Elizabeth legitimately has a distinguishing feature (She's a woman) compared to all other candidates.  
 Do you have a problem with non-US Candidates mentioning that feature about themselves that they feel adds additional value or useful perspective to their occupying the role?    It is the same thing.   Except I don't think anyone has accused Christian Kammler of not being German enough for it to be an attribute.  
Do you usually judge the potential effectiveness of women based on how attractive you personally find them?  The whole line of thinking is *wildy* inappropriate.
Have you ever spoken with Elizabeth?  Have you ever actually **seen** an instance where she "buckles under pressure" or is this another assumption because she's a woman?
@_date: 2013-03-22 23:18:29
The higher it gets, the more likely we hit a saturation point that causes the new buyers to look around nervously, wondering if the price has peaked for this round and if it's time to head for the door.  
The higher we go, the more violent the move to sell at the top will be, especially for people who buy in at these higher levels.
Personally I sold a bunch of mine at 35 knowing that by doing that I'd allow the price to go to much higher highs, you're all welcome.

The discussion name was called what it was, because the point of the conversation was to discuss and debunk what each hosts scenario. 
 Obviously bitcoin is really hard to kill, so it becomes an exercise in logic.
The whole show is built around the idea that people learn best when learning from their peers - All the hosts are wrong on a somewhat frequent basis (myself included) but we have enough difference of perspective and experiance to be able to correct each other on the things we haven't yet learned.
The show is intended for those new to Bitcoin, but still be entertaining and informative for veterans too - That means we talk about complicated issues, but take the time to ask and answer the dumb questions that new users don't connect in their heads yet.
If we want Bitcoin to succeed, people need to understand how it can help them in their lives personally.

Because a paywall prevents anyone from reading your work who isn't willing to give you $$ in advance.   
Keep in mind is that the vast majority of people writing on the web are doing so for exposure, rather than monetary compensation - This allows them to potentially receive both on a good piece without requiring the publisher to go out-of-pocket.    
With the paywall example you'd literally be choosing compensation over exposure, and I think with bitcoin it's a silly compromise to make.
If you don't make enough money and you decide this is how you're going to support yourself, you should try to write stories that people want to support- This system would give the tools to easily tell which of your articles generate lots of tips vs. ones that don't.

I am the full owner of Let's Talk Bitcoin, I am the primary content creator, content editor and stylistic director.  Let's Talk Bitcoin is a brand built around my personal ethos with the help of a lot of people who I've shared my vision with.  The link between LTB and myself is constant and 100% because at least right now in the lifecycle of LTB the direction and meta-level decision-making comes entirely from me.
I felt it was inappropriate to allow my personal views to muddy the waters of a candidate debate, and have also chosen to stay neutral as far as the show is concerned.   I don't think you'll be able to find an example that goes against that.     When you have a platform, it's important to follow the rules you set and be the example for everyone else. 
When I'm on Reddit, I have no advantage.  I have no megaphone.  I am speaking for myself, but just because I speak for myself does not mean it is inappropriate for me to state my qualification to speak on the topic.
Saying I'm the lead at LTB does not mean "LTB" endorses whatever I'm saying.  It's to state that I am the lead, i.e. am living this life and if you think LTB is an informed and credible media venture, you can safely assume I am informed and credible because, as previously mentioned, I am the physical manifestation of LTB.
Just because I opt to go above and beyond my responsibilities to keep LTB a non-partisan platform doesn't mean I'm not allowed to state my involvement.  I have good manners, but I'd be a fool to hide my full time occupation and it's not like it's financially lucrative to do what I do.
As to Trace's point, I totally agree and would love to see foundations forum be publicly accessible if not postable.

Hi Rassah,
I've worked with Elizabeth on and off for the last five months and found her to be intelligent, consistent, passionate and very pro-active.  
I think many members of the bitcoin community (myself included) prioritize doing good work over participating in every discussion on the various boards.  I used to post on BitcoinTalk, I used to visit IRC, but as more projects demand more time those things become lower priorities.
Elizabeth takes her job at Bitcoin Magazine seriously enough to devote many many hours to it, and if she wins the board seat I'm very confident in her ability to do the job, and her motives for wanting to do it.
Disclaimer: I've stated my support for Elizabeth's candidacy in her Bitcoin Foundation thread.

I think you should do at least some standard non-prototype color scheme options so journalists and writers new to bitcoin can have it match their standard page without having to first acquire bitcoins to pay for it.
I think it would be totally appropriate to sell "fancy" skins, and think .01 for either a blanket license or per-design basis would be fine.   If this winds up being heavily adopted one can imagine tens of thousands of writers using it in a short amount of time.

It's hard to want to spend Bitcoins with the price moving around like it does - I cashed out more than half of my BTC at $35 thinking there would be a meaningful correction, but so far I've been wrong on that count.
Most vendors throw up their hands and set their prices tied to US dollar valuation - If the price for the item is $45, the Bitcoin price is allowed to float on a daily or hourly average, only being set when a customer places an order for the item.
Those vendors can choose to convert recieved bitcoins automatically to dollars, or to keep Bitcoins and risk the exchange volatility.
The thing to **absolutely 100% avoid** is pre-ordering anything with Bitcoins.  I pre-ordered a piece of mining equipment for 24 bitcoins in August for delivery in october, Six months later I was granted an 11btc refund because the exchange rate changed, now those 11btc would be me 5x the hardware I pre-ordered in August for 24btc.  And if I had not been refunded when I did, I would have recieved less than 2btc.

The problem is, if you look at it from a rules-based standpoint, FinCEN isn't that scary - It's when you look at how they act in the context of real life, what kind of implact the US has on global lawmakings, and the fact that currency is a zero-sum game where Bitcoin can only win as much as government issued currencies lose things get.... iffy.

I actually didn't know **you** were paid by them at all, I was referring to BitPay not being a reliable source because they make money from BFL selling pre-orders, not from delivering product.
**I was calling you "naive", not "bribed" because you "feel better" about the product based on talking to everyone making money off it before it ships.**

More complicated for whom?  OpenID, fb Connect, Twitter connect, all rely on a central organization who owns and controls your identity.   With Bitcoin ID your ID lives on the blockchain and the keys that control it would be on a client or plugin built into your browser - 
When you want to log-in to a website that uses it, you click the link - it pops up your bitcoin ID plugin (all local, no remote connection, no sending any information anywhere) - It prompts you for your password, and a login message is signed with your private key and sent to other nodes, seen immediately and you're in without ever needing to type in a password that traverses the internet.
From the user perspective it'll be the same, but the privacy, ownership, and control elements all get massively better, implementation is easier server side.  The process is not complicated, just the discussion of it lacking other context.  All the complicated stuff is automated by the time a user gets hands-on.

Also because last time the average price from a coinbase buyer was like 50% of the next cheapest group.  I just paid $25 in BTC for the bundle and I encourage those of you who value adoption from merchants like this to think about doing so to.  
Buy it as a gift if you don't play games, it's a good value at $25 and you're offsetting 6 bitcoin cheapskates.

It also introduces messaging and identity management tools in the same software platform as the rest of it, so to a certain extent it's a one-stop secure money/identity/communications platform with client side encryption utilizing a blockchain.

Its good for bitcoin, but it means we'll almost certainly see another crash.  Although this time unless it's just HORRIBLE (like the feds saying it's flat out illegal and they'll prosecute) I can't imagine it being as bad as the triple-hack of last time.

Is that true when you're talking about media representation for a distributed currency?   I think the skill-sets that make good developers are not the same as those of media liaisons, and yet I see more developers on that list than media liaisons.  
There is a disconnect here - The best people for the job are simply not being selected for ideological reasons, you don't think that's bad if the stated intent is to improve media relations?
@_date: 2013-03-23 15:24:22
The question is: Where do you guys suggest they advertise to reach the bitcoin community?
Do you think it would be better to offer lower prices for bitcoin, or the put together packages that include "extras" and charge the same price in any currency?
Should they have a presence on the bitcoin forums?  Reddit?  Seems like there isn't a very good way to reach "bitcoin users" yet, but I thought someone might have an idea
@_date: 2013-04-02 21:45:19
I bet you 10 bitcoins that 10% of the bitcoins available for trade could be  purchased before you find the FED running out of US Dollars.   Bitcoins are limited in quantity, US Dollars are not - You may not be willing to sell at 10,000 per coin but I bet lots of your peer would.

Sneak's Law says users either cannot or will not secure their keys, so asking them to do it is a recipe for failure.
Bitmessage and subsequent iterations have flaws but they completely automate the encryption process which means that even an incompetant/lazy user like myself will have encrypted messaging where with PGP and the other myriad options available, I will not.
@_date: 2013-07-23 21:37:22
But bitcoin securities traded privately or on the exchanges aren't "real" securities.  If they are, the exchanges are totally out of compliance.
Either it's legitimate or it's not, but it can't be both legitimate for SEC enforcement without the exchanges needing to comply with regulators.

I2P has different vulnerabilities, but it's also much more asynchronous than TOR if I recall correctly (it's been a few years since I've looked at I2P).  So they accomplish the same thing, through different means.
For communication, it really looks to me that something like Bitmessage might be the path forward.

Hi Tuur,
Great perspective - Interested in contributing it to the Let's Talk Bitcoin guest blog?
@_date: 2013-05-20 23:03:59
I'm sorry you were unhappy with this show, but the reality is we're all Americans, and the greatest threat to Bitcoin right now is regulatory action coming from the american government.  You may not think that affects the rest of the world, but in fact it has quite a large impact as the US heavily influences world regulatory actions through the various forms of financial support they provide, and because the US currency is the backing of nearly every other currency on the planet.   
Let's Talk Bitcoin is not a show that claims to be unbiased, and in fact we do not even try to hide it.  Each host has their own opinion, and the hope is that by presenting the variety of perspectives the listener is able to make up their own mind.  
I believe it is dishonest and unethical to pretend to be unbiased when the reality is that every journalist is inherently biased, we are all shaped by our experiances as we go through life and it is the pretense of non-bias that causes problems.   We do not claim to be unbiased, we claim to be authentic, honest, and have the obvious conversations that naturally emerge because they are the conversations that should be occurring everywhere, but generally don't.
I am happy to answer any other specific complaints you might have, and always appreciate feedback with the opportunity to clarify our position.

The trouble here is assuming there is a common good. That one solution fixes a problem faced by everyone, regardless of situation or status.
I don't think it does.  I don't think it even can be expected to.  Centralization here, as with all things is the real evil -
 Fewer people making choices for more people means the people invested in that decision on a personal level is every diminishing and the numbers whose voices simply do not matter because they are "represented" gets larger by the day.

I think the refund policy of USD value would be fine, if they hadn't taken pre-orders so far in advance and blown so many self-imposed deadlines and ship-dates with literally no way to get your value back until now, when you're literally getting back 50% of the BTC spent.    That's my situation at least.
If they had been up-front about the release date being after October, I would have waited until release.   I'm sure I'm not alone in that.
@_date: 2013-05-24 14:16:00
It's really not that tough.  If a coin comes out with a large supply side community, lacks any advantage besides being easy to mine, possibly pre-mined and is marketed as something other than what it is, it's a scamcoin.   We can call it something else, but I'd be curious which altchains you think are ambiguous and difficult to tell if a scam or if they have actual hope of being something besides a pump and dump?
Again, I think alt-chains have a purpose - But the purpose of some alt-chains is to be easy to mine for a quick flip based on marketing.
@_date: 2013-06-23 04:05:22

to purchase, and pay with Bitcoin by using the link under the other options (they put it there after hardly anyone bought with Bitcoin)
If you don't want to give to HB that's fine, but I encourage you to think about giving some BTC to charities or friends while the value is so high, it's a great way to get people feeling like they have a piece of this crazy thing and help spread the word.
@_date: 2013-03-29 01:46:50
Because after losing 50% of their investment, they'll never use bitcoins again and they think they're a bad idea.   You should care about people having a bad experience with bitcoin, even if you think they're losers.

Hey Piachu,

@_date: 2013-03-29 02:09:48
Why do you think this would just affect americans?  If suddenly 10% of the bitcoins in the world are dumped on the market, that would affect the price of bitcoin, which would then painfully translate to EVERY local currency people cash out into.
The fact that FinCen decided not regulate bitcoin means they don't want to be looking at what's happening in the market.  Why on earth would that be the case that this new exciting competitor to their dominant world reserve currency is blossoming into a viable entity, and they have no interest in regulating it...?

It could be the beginning if it causes a fundamental reinvention of banks, where the same organizations remain but the way they do business completely changes.   
It could be the end if it causes a fundamental reinvention of the services banks used to provide, but instead of being provided by those banks it's provided by a rules-based protocol (like Bitcoin)

Given that BFL used customer pre-order funds to develop and manufacture the product, I don't see how a Bitcoin escrow solution could possibly work since the funds wouldn't be available until they were delivered.
@_date: 2013-04-03 17:06:44
Initial bitcoin adoption is driven by speculation, but cemented by utility and convenience. Bubbles pop because the price outweighs the utility, but here's that's just not the case.  And even if you don't buy any bitcoins until the price is at 1,000,000 it doesn't cost you anything because when you trade your dollars in for currency you still get the utility provided.   
Larger prices are easily managed by moving the decimal point to increase the supply (and decrease the per coin price) but even without that, they're divisible to more than 8 decimal places so higher prices just means smaller amounts.
@_date: 2013-07-21 16:10:20

Agreed with other commenter, this is a healthy attitude to have for Bitcoin - Spend bitcoins for stuff or services you need, don't pre-order with Bitcoin, and don't sell bitcoin.
If nothing else, the regulatory situation for Bitcoin could wind up painting those selling BTC for dollars as "money launderers", whereas they've flat out said if you don't sell them for other currencies than they're not regulated.
@_date: 2013-09-14 21:36:44
Yeah so am I, but it's the flour not the honey.  I remember it though :) Magical.
@_date: 2013-03-29 01:16:07
You're proving my point.  If a single entity, with bad intentions, were to buy up 10% of available bitcoins and as you say it drove the price up to $100 million dollars each, imagine what would happen to the market when they dump them all as I propose they should. 
 
 **Imagine what this does to the person who bought .00003 bitcoin when the price was 50 million per coin and sold when the price was only 5 million per coin.**  
@_date: 2013-09-21 13:51:27
Two reasons
One, I wanted to launch with a lower price to let the first users who we are essentially testing the system with be rewarded.   The price is going to basically double, if you look at other video conference passes you'll see we're actually the cheapest out there and still will be be at $50 for 6.5hrs worth of content.
Two, we're going to add video downloads to streaming packages on customer requests.

We've received several 1BTC donations during the time we've been doing the show, just got one for episode 10 last night actually (thanks to whoever!).
Let's Talk Bitcoin is a podcast on the audience facing side, and a idea/connection generation engine internally.  Basically I've poured myself into this, and now my brain lives full time in the future of Money.  Content is my passion, so applying bitcoin to that makes all the sense in the world - but beyond that, you're right on - It's about helping people make the connections in their own mind and see what they can do.
It's that part.  The what people can do part, that's so interesting to me.  I've always had ideas and very rarely the opportunity to make them real, we're in a special time.
@_date: 2013-04-02 14:05:53
As a writer, I love the fact that if each story has a public bitcoin address and I label them properly, I can think of them almost like ongoing royalties for each article that provide funds but almost as importantly, feedback on which of my articles most resonate.
I think if the widget looked good and the interface was easy for non-technical writers to use (just slap in the HTML and swap the bitcoin address) this would spread like wildfire.   A few big name early adopters would be very helpful in this.

Except that the markets go up on bad news just as readily as good news, and it's been that way for quite some time.   Just because a bubble lasts a long time doesn't mean it's not a bubble.   
Frankly the same is true for bitcoin - While you're perfectly right, that the value is earned, the reality is new markets are voltile markets and Bitcoin is nothing if not new.  This latest crisis barely made a dent in the new highs, so while it might keep going I wouldn't be the least bit suprised if it peaked and dove to the $10 level for a while.    If Bitcoin works its eventual value is obviously enormous, but it's not a straight line there, despite many people wishing that were so.

Do you pick your price at the deli when you buy a sandwich?  No, there are cheaper options and more expensive options depending on a variety of factors - Same thing here.   You can pick your option that fits your needs, but not the price of that option.  
Your assumption that the every single design will be available for free is faulty in that it assumes "free" is the same thing as "comes at zero cost" - 
When you pirate, you're viewing ads which support the bandwidth to the host providing it, sometimes the thing you think you're downloading isn't the thing you're actually downloading which wastes your time and effort, sometimes the thing just doesn't work like you thought, or isn't compatable with your system because - gasp - nobody was paid to make it work for you, so you have to make it work for yourself.  Since there are no quality controls here, sometimes it's got a virus embedded in it which then takes your time.
Just because you don't value your time doesn't mean that's a universal rule.   Have you ever created a product that's gone to market?  Have you ever brought an idea from conception to manufacturing?  I seriously doubt it, because if you did you'd have a more meaningful appreciation of the YEARS it can take to make a complicated design work.     Ideas are easy, functional products are not.   
 If my proposal was "hey everybody, if you have an idea just throw it in the bucket and someone will pay you a dollar for it" than  you'd be right, but that's not it - I'm talking about a curated library of functional, useful objects where sharing and improvement of those designs would be collaborative, compensated, and most importantly easy.    Everybody wins, designer, consumers, manufacturers.

Totally agree, if you're going to take 100% payment up-front for a product, you have some responsibilities to stick to self-imposed deadlines, which this outfit has not.

Hi Canton,
There are a couple of reasons:
* They don't appear to advertise, so lacking people buying because they accept Bitcoin it's rare their native audience overlaps with Bitcoins 
*There is no advantage - They still need your personal information regardless of how you pay to ship you the book, and there is no discount associated with paying in Bitcoin.  In order for people to want to pay in a deflationary currency you have to offer incentives that line up with their expectations for future growth - Namely, you have to make things cheaper.

44:48 - What is your opinion of Alt-Coins?
@_date: 2013-03-29 01:23:02
If they all go into bitcoin, they have no impact at all on the US money supply.  Want to think about it again for a minute?   If what you're saying was true, it would also be true of the 65 billion in monthly mortgage backed securities the Fed purchases.

Except flattr charges 10% for transaction fees, that makes bitcoin funky competition that eats your models lunch.

So it wouldn't create any additional burden for the Winklevoss's enterprise, rather it's a value-add that can be provided by their partners?   Is that right?

My guess is it'll be a holdout, then pile-in.  Nobody wants to be first but once the taboo is broken by a major brand the risk becomes substantially lower for other major brands to get into it, especially if the early adopter sees advantage from doing so.

I would recommend the Ed &amp; Ethan show - They're the "morning zoo" to our NPR, and are a couple nice canadian chaps to boot.

...Except Coinlab becomes their broker/dealer, instead of a advantageously positioned competitor in Gox's largest market.
People keep saying this deal is one-sided - The number of clauses is not what's important, it's what each side gains and sacrifices.  Gox gets to keep it's dominance where otherwise they would lose a substantial amount of business to Coinlab, which would have much better and easier funding for US customers.  That's a major win for Gox - Can nobody else see that?
@_date: 2013-04-24 13:53:03
That's about right - Look at how drug policy flows from the United States to the rest of the world.  Bitcoin is money, if anything it's more important.

In order for that to be true, they have to consider Bitcoins "Cash" - Remember, this guy only took Bitcoins.   
If bitcoins are money, no problem - SEC is right - But would you be so sure about the arguement if instead of paying cash they paid in beanie babies or bottle caps?    The SEC is demonstrating that Bitcoins are much more like cash than beanie babies, otherwise they wouldn't care.

Whoa there, hold on a second.
When I deposit money in a bank, how do I profit?  They pay me .01% annual interest, exactly how do I gain?   I keep money in banks because it is more convenient for me to write a check or use a debit card to pay for things than to carry all my US dollars in my back pocket everywhere I go, I actually take a loss from collecting such a low interest rate while inflation substantially higher.
The problem with our system is all banks are covered by deposit insurance, which makes it so you don't have to care about if your bank takes good risks or bad risks because if they fail, you're still covered.  Of course, this is an illusion as the amount of money in the FDIC is less than 1% of the amounts insured, and when small banks fail (and they do nearly every week) they often have holes in their balance sheets in the 20-40% range.
You're right, regulators play a role in this but it's in not setting the incentives.  What Andreas is proposing is a return to reality from the current state we have now where winning bets are a "win" and a losing bet is a draw because the state picks up the tab. 
If someone commits a crime, you know, like pervasive fraud and misrepresentation of asset values, they should be taken to trial and held account as the letter of the law dictates.  Right now that cannot happen because these crimes are *systemic* and if you were to hold one example to account it calls into question why none of the others have.   In the late 80s, hundreds of bankers **went to jail** and yet after 2007 there have been what, two scapegoats?  Bankers are people too, and if people commit crimes they need to be held accountable *or else the system is not a legal system, but an illegal system*
It used to be a banks job to take calculated risk, now it's their job to try and find return on investment wherever they can and at any price because  otherwise they are insolvent and fail, which can't and won't be allowed.

Hey Omni,
.434btc in support received in the first 10hrs since release - Looks pretty likely to hit our goal for this episode, and it's already been from more donors which is really promising.  I'm concerned people who donate larger amounts (.5btc and above) will donate a lot up front then go away - Better to have more people chip in and put the burden less on the larger donors.
All in all, I think it's going very well!  The show will continue, I wouldn't worry about that.

There was a time when paper wallets were basically mandatory, but the problem is basically gone.
Early bitcoin wallets did not have password protection, so stealnig control of an entire wallet was as simple as stealing the wallet.dat file.   This became a problem, so wallet encryption was added and now so long as you encrypt your wallet with a decent password you can basically hand it out on thumb drives without putting yourself at much risk.
The threats these days are phishing attacks and being hooked into a bot-net that uses your CPU/GPU to very inefficiently and uncovertly mine for BTC.
@_date: 2013-03-29 01:20:06
If I were a central bank I wouldn't do these every week.  You'd want them to be rare, and terrifying when they do happen causing horrible losses that take as long as possible (months at first, then weeks) to recover from.
You'd want the new money who bought in during the climb to HURT, 40%+ losses at least to make sure they have NO interest in ever looking at a cryptocurrency again after they panic sell on the downswing.   
Lets remember most people buying into bitcoin now are doing so for speculative reasons, not so they can buy alpaca socks
@_date: 2013-05-24 15:26:54
lol great question
@_date: 2013-03-23 01:50:45
I'd be really suprised if that is the path the federal government chooses to take. I think its MUCH more likely they'll play their cards close to their hand, act like they're going to be OK with it which will encourage people to experiment with it.   
Then when the market is nice and fat, they'll do something really really scary like announce a new regulation regime, or onerous compliance requirements that make it very difficult to use bitcoins for legitimate, taxpaying business.
The only place they can control it is when people convert out of bitcoin into the dollar, and that's not enough control for bitcoin to get big without causing major trouble for dollar supremacy.   They can't let it do that.
They have to wait until the masses are starting to accept it, then crush it and scare the late adopters out of it with a big loss and no desire to ever look at a cryptocurrency again. 
 If I wanted to keep my currency the reserve that's what I'd do.

@_date: 2013-06-28 19:36:11
It is coincidental, wikipedia for context
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:53:42
I totally agree, but it's a first episode and we haven't gone into detail really about anything yet.  With a daily show you can expect the content and format to morph over time.  I think *most* people who exist in the world of bitcoin have some wrong assumptions, it's obvious in episode one that was true about each of us. 
 But because of our different points of view and backgrounds I think the listener gets to learn along with us as we talk and correct each others misconceptions.
It is not my intention to create an echo chamber, but at the same time it's hard to find someone who understands why bitcoins are valuable without thinking they're going up in the long term, in less they fail completely.  
The price movements now are dangerous to new people, and as I mentioned I am not recommending my extended family and friends get in at these prices because I just can't see this type of movement without a major correction...
 But I could be wrong, it's a market that truly has a truly limited supply, which is unlike any other modern market I can think of where additional supply can be fabricated as a promise-to-pay without having the underlying item.  So it *could* be a revaluation.    Would you say Gold is in a bubble since 2000?  Same argument here, except no derivatives market to suppress the real asset value.
Ultimately the show is a pro-bitcoin property because all the people involved view it as an incredibly enabling means to an end.  Any end really, whatever end you as an individual user wants to apply it to - I appreciate your comment and very much your concerns, and hope to show over time it's about helping new users and analyzing current events, not cheerleading.

No, "Centralized Decentralized" would be an oxymoron.  Organized decentralization means everybody starts with the same framework and builds the organization best suited for their local based on local factors.  It means we have the same core beliefs, but not the same means or motives.
@_date: 2013-03-22 20:40:41
I'd love to do something like this, and I've actually tried it in the past with very little success.   It's a chicken/egg problem:
It takes work to produce good, original content
But to my knowledge no podcasts are built like this, so nobody makes content like it, so to start one is to start from nothing.
I tried it before during the height of the occupy movement, had people call-in from events around the world and give updates on what everyone was doing.  I got maybe 20 submissions over 2 weeks, which isn't bad, but they were all very similar and not very good.
If the bitcoin community is different, I'd love to do something like that

Oh Snap!
Couple of things:
He is starting an altcoin, he's just sharing the ideas and problems that necessitate it - You can value them or not.  I don't think it's fair to claim he has a "favorite paper token currency".
Centralization of mining means fewer entities which raises the possibility of targeting miners in the same way they target Exchanges now.   Do you deny this is possible?  Do you deny it's being driven by the arms race in mining hardware?
If there are supposed to be 52560 blocks discovered per year (one every 10 minutes), and if instead of that we're finding 105120 (one every 5 minutes) that means the long distance between difficulty adjustments is enabling far more inflation than intended by the protocol.    Do you not see this?  It's not "ASICS" it's the arms race being enabled by highly competitive ASIC development.
Thanks for your comment, the point of the LTB guest blog is to start conversations around new ideas - Even if you don't think much of them :) 
@_date: 2013-04-13 05:49:45

I moderated a debate, then I released the debate, then I waited until the voting was over, and then I stated my opinion.  
Again I ask, isn't it better for me to be up front with my personal beliefs so you can judge the quality of my work knowing my motivation and ask if I was being idealogical or being fair?
I challenge you to find a single piece of work I've done that does not meet and exceed this standard.
If I am an insider, that's a funny way to pick insiders.  I put my name and face out there for the first time in April of 2013.
I think my record stands for itself, can you say the same?
The Foundation is a **advisory** level group, having no authority or power.  You can make them out to be an evil empire all you want but look at what they actually can do and you'll quickly realize you've gotten all upset about a figurehead organization here just as with Lifeboat. 
They attempt to be leaders, they are not rulers.  If you agree with them, follow them.  If not, do your own thing.  
You've chosen to take a stand against your own side, I don't think you'll find anyone fighting harder for a free and transparent cryptocurrency ecosystem than I am and yet you throw out my contributions because I had the gall to have an opinion you disagree with.
It's just sad, I hope you can learn to better pick your battles and discern your enemies.

That's not a bad idea, I  hadn't thought about doing this as a desktop app.  
@_date: 2013-04-29 23:30:46
Things like this are always impossible ideas until they're adopted, then they're brilliant ideas.
I don't think a change like this can happen without the government resigning and being replaced at least once or twice.
But if the people get wise, and demand something like this as a control on government corruption and to put a clamp on the promises government can make, it could be forced through very quickly.   And if that happened, Cyprus would be on the recieving side of a huge amount of value as Bitcoins deflate.

Why would securing your wallet or learning about cryptography have any impact at all?   We're talking about the market price of bitcoin - New people buy when it's on it's way up, they sell on the way down (that's psychology for you)
It doesn't matter what their reasons are, if they lose enough money investing in bitcoin they'll just hate the concept because it was so costly to them personally and stick with good ol' paper.   
So I (the central bank) win, and the best you can say is "we didn't want them anyhow"

Couldn't agree more with Erik on this one, Vitalik is right at the top of the list when it comes to journalists doing quality work in the Cryptocurrency space.

Except everybody would know about it because the issuance rate and reserves are transparent.  Sarcasm aside, do you not see the potential for something like this?  It's a workable lightweight, transparent gold standard attached to a deflationary currency on a predictable path for the next 130 years

So if the podcast was about the evolution of humans, we wouldn't talk about relevant experiments or studies on chimps?  Many lines of research are simply not able to be performed on humans, and yet the questions remain.
This is my point, just because they're not THE SAME doesn't mean they're not instructive to the topic.  This is even more true with Bitcoin and the alts than humans and chimps because Bitcoin really can take any part of an alt that is compelling and incorporate it into the protocol should there be consensus that's a good idea.

And thats just the stuff I can talk about.  Have you tipped recently? ;) 
@_date: 2013-04-22 16:51:40
The limited supply of Bitcoins is the basis on which everything is built.  Mining does not create bitcoins, it creates the circumstances under which a block of bitcoins are created.
The real utility of Bitcoin that gives it lasting value is the ease, speed, and cost of transactions to anywhere in the internet connected world - Try to find another currency or commodity that has the same liquid, p2p flow over any distance and I'll give you a cookie.
In tomorrows episode of show.thedailybitcoin.com we're doing a few minutes on the topic addressing bitcoin funding underground churches in china, bitcoin being used to transmit moneys from California to Mexico, bitcoin being used to deal with hyperinflation in Iran.

As a central bank,  you don't want to crush Bitcoin - If you pull the "buy them all up and throw them away" trick then you've just pumped all this money into the hands of people interested in cryptocurrency - What's to stop a new fork from popping up in an instant that everyone can buy back into, except this time it doesn't have the ability to have coins be "destroyed".  Think the Napster progression.
No, as a central bank you need to discredit cryptocurrency in general and bitcoin specifically, I just had a thread on bitcointalk entitled "If I were a Central Bank, Here's What I'd Do" and honestly the results were not pretty.  People got *angry*, but nobody really had any answers.
That's the biggest problem as I see it, Bitcoin is still small enough that a central bank like the Fed could slowly buy bitcoins over a long period of time, then turn from the biggest buyer to the biggest seller and dump everything on the market, and walk away from the table. 
Most everybody who bought into the ramp-up would be crushed, and human psychology makes it very difficult to resist selling on the way down, especially when many of the people investing don't understand the underlying value premise and are just in it for speculative reasons.
@_date: 2013-04-26 19:14:29
Except there is no company, and we're talking about a decentralized system where a few people set themselves up as kingmakers and quietly, without telling anyone, applied their particular brand of idealogy to their selection criteria.  
Frankly I think this problem will be solved by the outrageous nature of the selection process - Somebody or a bunch of somebodies will do the job they're refusing to do: maintain and publicize a list of press contacts who are knowledgeable about bitcoin and able to speak to media in a coherent, concise and engaging way.
As opposed to what appears to have happened: People were selected for technical knowledge and political ideology rather than for actual ability to engage with media in a way that will work.
Thats a fine way to pick a book club, but a pretty shitty way to handle PR.
@_date: 2013-03-29 01:45:07


It means they have to play by the same rules as everybody else, while right now they print what they want, when they want, and do what they need to get the job done.
How many times in the last 5 years have the rules been changed at the governmental level (Cyprus anybody?) because there was no option.  With bitcoin,  you can't do that - Not without convincing everybody it's a good idea first.
Would the people in cyprus have supported that rule change?  I don't think so.
They are losing EVERYTHING, they lose control.

So when bitcoins are worth a thousand dollars each and your aunt asks you if she should buy bitcoins because the TV says they're a good investment and they've been going up in value for 6 months, you'd say...?
@_date: 2013-05-06 05:20:05
The problem is no "real" exchange will touch it because it's not real money to them, so bridge companies say "OK if it's not real money, than anyone can do it" - FinCEN says "Nope, it's real money... sometimes...." so banks start closing their bank accounts, but since it's still really ambiguous how the laws are going to shake out there is no incentive for any legacy-money player to step into the gap.
It is a mess, that's the only thing that can be said with certainty.

His comment isn't directed at ALL bankers and speculators, it's from a conversation about whether it's better to bail out or bail in failing financial institutions that can't be allowed to fail.  His solution was they're both bad options because they take the onus off of the failures and put them onto bystanders, either taxpayers or depositors.

I think the great part about Bitcoin is that it's money, so nearly anybody can use it to enable nearly anything.  Your "let's go do it from scratch ourselves" is someone elses "now I can start a business" is someone elses "now we can fundraiser for Joeys T-Ball team" etc.
Bitcoin is the glue that will eventually tie all these disparate groups together because it allows each person to do whatever the hell they want.  What could be better than that

It depends what kind of information we're working with.  When you export your transactions from your wallet application, that generally includes the exact time-stamp the transaction was signed.  
When we're dealing with public addresses, the closest we can get is the block which for nearly any reporting purpose is more than sufficient.
The current implementation actually uses a daily average, as it's proof-of-concept to make sure there is actually demand for this service.

Well one difference is there I had a 1-800 number and people called in from events which were all basically the same - everybody sitting around trying to get organized and not get kicked out by the police.
I suppose having computers and electricity might help produce good content :)
Is there any demand for this?  If we had a "guest reporter" segment every show that featured a 5-10 minute story from a non-live contributor talking about something specific, would you listen?

Just to put this out there, I am also a member of the Lifeboat foundation and so are a bunch of mid-level commenters and pundits in the Bitcoin Space.  The Lifeboat Foundation's organizer approached all of us around the same time and offered some grant opportunities and publication opportunities in exchange for nothing from us.
At no time was ideology mentioned, just that they wanted to create a board of Bitcoin experts who would help advise them and assign grants possibly to interesting projects.
I'll only speak for myself, but I joined as a resume booster and have had very few interactions with them.  Trace is just as busy as I am, I'd be shocked if he's ever interacted with them at all after the initial recruitment.
It's a resume line-item, not an idealogical motive.  You can believe whatever you want about the organization but I just wanted to mention membership is not even an endorsement for most members.

The foundation is an advisory body, doesn't actually control Bitcoin in any way shape or form....
What the heck are you talking about?

The question is are they willing to play by the same rules as everyone else.
If under the current system they do not have to follow the rules, than any system that changes that is a loss by any standard.   You correctly invoke the prisoners dilemma here, with the loss assured the only question is who loses least.
But who says the loss is assured?  Complex systems can keep running for a long time after their fundamentals break down, I think that's the space we're in now.
Everybody knows things are broken, but the question is will they fully fail or can they be propped up long enough to muddle through.  Players will opt to believe in the "Muddle Through" scenario until they can no longer plausibly defend it, at which point it'll be a run to safety all at once.

The subtle difference is nobody has to do anything, but if that happens everybody loses because there legitimately is nobody to save bitcoin but the people who operate bitcoin nodes.   Coincidentally, they're also heavily invested in bitcoins continued stable functioning.
I think it's a really good system - Everybody works together to address the difficulty in the least painful, quickest way possible because they themselves have the most to lose from any problems.   
Our banking sector would be just like that if there was no central bank to inject monetary stimulus and criminal laws were enforced regardless of who broke them.   The best part about bitcoin is nobody can break the rules as governed by the consensus.  Not even the developers.  All they can do is make their case, and if they're compelling they'll win.  
But if they're wrong, there's nothing stopping someone from coming to Reddit or the BitcoinTalk forums and making the case for why the Devs are wrong, and why everyone should do what they think.    I don't know about you, but I sure prefer that to electing someone to be Mr. Right-Even-When-I'm-Wrong-Shut-Up-Already for 4 years at a time.  That doesn't seem to work too well.

Yeah you're deal is only as good as your marketing
I have a digital product coming out soon we're charging $25 in Bitcoin and $35 in USD.

That's it.  Open to suggestions, it's not supposed to be conclusive rather informative and accessible to people who have never of the topic but would like a high level technical understanding.

I'll correct it in the shownotes, don't think I can correct it here.

I have a problem with people who are willfully wrong and have no desire to educate themselves.  I form my opinion of people based on their actions, you should think about your actions, they make you look desperate for attention.

I hear what you're saying, but that's not actually a law of physics - You made it up.
If what you're saying was true,  why does itunes or amazon's music service seem to have customers willing to participate voluntarily, and pay for music?  Everybody knows you can go download anything for free off torrent sites, so why don't those business models fail?
I'll respond to this in more depth in a while, but seriously - Just because *you* disagree with something doesn't make it against the laws of physics, you might look up the definition of physics if that's confusing.

We don't claim to figure out your true taxable income is, and it says right there in the headline you can PM instead of giving your email.
It takes all your transactions and gets US Dollar cost basis information to determine the value you've sent or received with the wallet/address/addresses.
The information is useful to many, and a pain to figure out lacking an automated system like the one we're building.

I would argue the beginning of the end would be moving to a fiat standard in the early 70s - Since then debt has continually built in the system with serial bubbles, yadda yadda yada you know the story, until we're at the point where there is no margin for error and the flow of medicine can never stop without the whole system imploding.
I think this is the end of the end - The system has been broken so long that somebody finally came up with a system that lets us avoid it entirely.  Buckminster Fuller said 
*“In order to change an existing paradigm you do not struggle to try and change the problematic model. You create a new model and make the old one obsolete.”*
But that can only happen once the problem has been identified and all solutions to fix the existing model have failed, lacking that there is little will to change from something that works.

Because I'm a dues-paying member of the foundation.  
I volunteered my time and expertise to arrange and produce a candidate debate because I was unhappy with the lack of coverage the election was getting, and wanted to learn more about the candidates.
I encourage you to listen to the debate and point out any actions I took  you feel demonstrate bias or might sway the listener unfairly towards one candidate or another.
Do you feel I do not have the right to express my personal opinion on a reddit thread?  LTB Listeners will know I have not used the show in any way to help one candidate over another.
In politics there is a temptation to badmouth the frontrunner because you'd rather they not be the front runner.  That's fine, but it doesn't change the facts.  Elizabeth did the most outreach, was the most responsive, and the results showed the efficacy of her efforts.  Am I wrong?

Attend board meetings, they can sit on committees (Like the Education, Regulatory Affairs, etc committees).  They get to vote on decisions put before the board.

With a tool like the one we're creating, at the end of the year you just export your transactions from your wallets and run it through our tool, which allows you to retroactively track and account for everything on and individual and aggregate level.

The  current version is built using the blockchain.info api so I believe it comes from Gox, which has been the gold standard for bitcoin price until pretty recently.     Future versions will use a basket of exchanges

Now that the debate is past, personally (**Adam B. Levine**) I'm voting for **Elizabeth Ploshay**.  We've worked together multiple times in the past, she understands that the Foundation needs to focus on education and helping facilitate decentralized movement rather than trying to jump in front of the parade and pretend to be leading.
I was actually going to run for the seat myself but after speaking with Elizabeth at length about how the foundation should develop, I felt like she'd represent my interests well and have more time to devote to the role.
@_date: 2013-09-13 01:02:32
Yes, this is the appropriate move I think.

Xrandr, you're picking little chunks out of context to respond to, and omitting parts you don't have a good answer to.  If you want to have a serious conversation, respond to what I said in context.

Good ideas :)  Haven't looked at any of these.
