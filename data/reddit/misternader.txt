Interesting. Agree we should NOT look to them as anything other than counterparty... My point was more like "look even Goldman is forced to acknowledge" etc.  Also agree that the fork is disconcerting on several levels.

Yikes.

Let's say digital currency then and thx, good point 
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:20:03
Just curious, because of hacking potential or company error or..?

I sympathize with your ideology , and certainly have no particular fondness for banks (or "bank holding companies").  One thing we can agree on from Goldman Sucks , though, is what their CEO said re: BTC... "Folks were also skeptical when paper money replaced gold."  BTC is part of the evolution of money which means, alas, the big money boys incl. Goldman Sucks will want to play, too.

Ok but let's say they simultaneously issue fed coin and say "it's now illegal to hold or trade BTC..." 
Am just trying to think thru disaster scenarios.. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 05:08:01
Haha, amen

I wouldn't sleep on Goldman , but I agree they're just trying to be relevant.  In finance world it's a big deal when these guys say something -- to those who care -- but I just view it as yet another step in right direction, i.e. widespread acceptance. In other words, HODL all the way. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 18:58:23
How's that ?

So there's no added security on the vault (other than "multi sig" which appears to mean just 2 email addresses need to approve withdrawal)? Guess I was erroneously under impression Vault somehow had "beefed up" security other than multiple signatures being reqd.

Ok I just mean some sort of alternative to BTC. A store of value that can be transferred electronically and safely similar to Bitcoin , but one with the "blessing" of the fed or let's say several US states.

Agree that we simply don't know. Wise to "be formless like water" like Bruce Lee said. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 18:06:54
Interesting. Wonder why not just say on same day. Guess we will see what AMZN does (or does not) say! 
@_date: 2017-09-21 18:02:47
I haven't been able to find anything yet from AMZN directly. However, I will say that I do trust Altucher and his opinions. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 18:40:48
Good point, guess we'll need the data (or at least AMZN would have run some scenarios, one imagines).  Also I wonder if they may perhaps "circle" other cryptos , like "oh we will accept BTC, ETH, and xyz..."

You are a wise one, I think. 
@_date: 2017-10-04 21:54:16
Really? That sucks. Is that based on rules for other assets or...? 
@_date: 2017-09-21 17:58:54
James Altucher on one of his email newsletters.  October 26 is when Amazon announces earnings, and Altucher has written that he believes there is a very high likelihood of them announcing something about crypto; more specifically, that they will begin accepting as payment. Have heard others whisper about this , but Altucher is only one I know that is publicly on record. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 16:49:05
True. I just like fact he's on record calling this out. He does have some credibility, so I view it as net positive, however distasteful the delivery may be. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 16:37:35
Do you know if any popular services (like oh, I dunno, say Coinbase for example) are required to disclose transactions to the feds ? Kind of like if you walk into a bank and ask for $10k in cash from your account, or want to deposit that amount, the bank is required to do a "cash transaction report" and tip off the gov? 
@_date: 2017-10-09 16:44:49
Totally agree. I just tried to cut through the (plentiful) noise in his pitch .. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 16:39:50
I really hope this is true !  
@_date: 2017-10-10 03:54:53
Haha 
@_date: 2017-10-05 04:10:32
Ay Chihuahua. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 16:53:54
I like !  Great success!! 
@_date: 2017-10-05 14:03:26
Wait, but could they even see your wallets? Assuming no audit. Or even if they did ..
