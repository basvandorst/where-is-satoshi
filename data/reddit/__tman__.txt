LN in it's current form doesn't depend on SegWit, just malleability fix. There are multiple options currently for malleability-only fixes that are not the same as SegWit at all and BCH devs have already taken the position that they will include it in a future hard fork whenever there's a clear benefit. Without LN, extra data in txs is basically cosmetic right now and no one cares enough if it changes before the tx is confirmed.

Here's some quick links that are making it clear that LN is not dependent on SegWit (first one is Greg).
Can you show me something that says LN is dependent on SegWit specific things such as excluding signature data or block weight concept?

I don't see any change.
The argument was never against 2nd layers. The argument was that the blocksize be increased so that fees stay low and confirmation times stay predictable.
He's said recently that BCH will likely adopt LN if it works.

Well LN is not a Bitcoin thing. There's a handful of coins intending to implement it. And considering that BCH and BTC code is so similar, it would make sense to just copy whatever is necessary. In fact it would be counterproductive and petty not to. I don't think the BCH devs share the same emotional animosity and irrationality as many onlookers (on both sides) seem to.

Although there are technical nitpicks about SegWit itself, that's not what split the community. It's three things about SegWit that caused all this...
1. Core prioritized SegWit before a "base" blocksize increase. This was done knowing that the blocks would become full, and fees would rise as is happening now. It was judged to be worth it to battle centralization, force adoption of off chain technology, and purposely create a fee market. The other side (mostly) was not against segregating witness data or adopting second layers, they just wanted Bitcoin to operate like normal until those things came along naturally. They were either ok with, or disagreed with, the arguments about centralization risk and fee markets.
2. SegWit was done as a soft fork and only had around 30-something% of signalled support at its peak (without 2X). A soft fork is a way to change the Bitcoin protocol in a way that old nodes won't be able to tell that anything is different and won't reject the changes. In software, whether or not something is backwards compatible is often pretty random and often not related to the complexity or scope of change. SegWit is an example of that. SegWit is a drastic change to the code and economics of Bitcoin, and many people felt a soft fork was a way to trick nodes into accepting controversial changes and that it would create unnecessary technical debt and problems during adoption compared to a hard fork.
3. Many people saw SegWit as a stepping stone towards goals they disagreed with, such as artificially creating a fee market, turning on chain into a settlement layer, and making Bitcoin's primary use into a digital gold rather than peer to peer cash.

I think the high fees are doing an incredible amount of damage to Bitcoin and to cryptocurrency as a whole. I think adoption is a greater driver of decentralization than blocksize increases are of centralization. I don't think atomic swaps are the solution because why hold Bitcoin if you have to swap it for alts, people would just hold alts.

I keep on seeing this "ChinaBU" phrase and it really comes off as racist. Why does it matter that anyone is from China? This is bitcoin, not TheWesternWorldCoin.

It's only "unlimited" up to 32MB. Miners cannot set it to anything above that.

It's "unlimited" up to 32MB. Miners cannot set it higher than that.

The HK agreement killed Classic.
