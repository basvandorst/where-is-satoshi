The problem with many Austrians speculating about Bitcoins is that they fail to connect the idea of subjective value to the Bitcoin. They state that, similar to fiat currency, the Bitcoin has no "intrinsic value", but in they fail to recognize that intrinsic value is determined not by the content of the media of exchange, but rather by the market's determination of value. Fiat currency has no intrinsic value because the market would not naturally choose it as a medium of exchange; Bitcoins have been naturally chosen.
As for deflation, Bitcoins have the wonderful advantage of being able to be split into smaller and smaller denominations; I don't really understand the perspective of those opposed to deflationary currency (I'm not an economist in any sense of the word), so I can't make a judgment on that.
Bitcoin is fairly unstable, especially at this (relatively) early point in its lifespan, but if it manages to survive for a while, I think that the instability should sort itself out, likely after the last Bitcoin is mined and the popularity of Bitcoin is at a reasonably stable position.

I don't think that "unstoppable inflation" would happen unless we quickly progressed to a point of economic post-scarcity (and at this point a "Star Trek" society is certainly feasibly), but I don't see anything like that happening, and certainly not due to Bitcoin.

I imagine the slow speed at which they will be mined in the near future will provide relative stability anyway. :P

You should clarify that statement; I'm not paying for air.
