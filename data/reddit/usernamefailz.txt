I did not understand anything, sorry
@_date: 2013-07-16 23:54:51
I was not planning on it being an investment but I guess it is one now lol

wtf is downvoting this? there is a legitimate problem with bitinstant that people should be aware of, why is there almost like a conspiracy to prevent this information from reaching any more people on r/bitcoin

Hi, can you please post a link to whatever product on silkroad you are using? I would love some for my self, i'm sure some others agree, thanks!
@_date: 2013-07-16 23:16:58
Thanks, I just wish I had known this before putting money in good thing I only got .5btc.

Thank you. I mentally signed up for coinbase after bitinstant holding me up for a week and then failing to serve my states (NY + NJ). But I already had an account @ localbitcoins I decided to use that and quickly found that it serves my needs completely. Had some free time today decided to give coinbase a try. After signing up, bank account and all, I had a last minute work related call, so I hurried through the buying process without putting in the amount of time I usually do before making a purchase from a brand new website, but its not like I was failing to pay somewhat proper attention.  Ten minutes later of course the order gets cancelled, and I discover i'm not getting my bitcoins any time soon lol.

I'm sure they have their legitimate reasoning, I just feel like I should have been made explicitly aware that I'd have to wait this long before I made the purchase. I'm sure its buried there somewhere, but I repeated the order process to maker sure- its not explicitly stated anywhere as you are making an order/a new account.

great read PLEASE learn how to use paragraphs it was LITERALLY painful to read on my shitty screen.
@_date: 2013-03-03 20:23:52
Off topic, but would someone care to quickly explain how people feel its appropriate upon discovering something new to ask the involved group made up entirely of strangers for free money?
With not even a sob story/excuse/reason for anyone to "donate". 
@_date: 2013-07-16 23:53:37
i did not know what to expect
@_date: 2013-03-03 13:06:24
in your e-pinion?
@_date: 2013-03-03 22:11:27
Ok I guess I could understand that, but what would make him expect a bunch of somewhat money-oriented people to give him money for no reason other than just to give someone "some extra coins". Baffling lol, he is not even "technically" begging.
@_date: 2013-03-05 01:05:56
Is it not obvious to most people that nobody can "know"? It goes without saying potential buyers are interested in people's predictions, if they are dumb enough to believe someone can "know" which direction a free market exchange rate will go then they deserve to get swindled. If anyone can correct me if i'm wrong that would be great, I'm only a novice in economics and computer science which seem to be the most important schools of knowledge applicable to bitcoins.

this looks great for UK users (i'm in US), can anyone vouch for this sites trustworthiness?
@_date: 2013-03-05 01:27:35
Checked out the website seems interesting... could you share any simple ways of buying litecoins? Preferably with cash, a bank transfer could work as well I suppose if need-be. 
@_date: 2013-07-16 23:54:14
know what simple shit? transactions are fast and easy on bitinstant/bitfloor when it existed and localbitcoins for the most part
@_date: 2013-07-16 23:05:45
I've been using bitcoins succesfully for over half a year, not that long but no one has ever stolen bitcoin from me(knock on wood) and the only hickup has been after months of using bitinstant, 600 usd in limbo for a week but eventually resolved. Since then I have been using sellers on Localbitcoin who accept bank deposits and do everything quickly(whole transaction 90 minutes). I think I will stick to localbitcoin.

I like how when you call them they request that the phone line be used for "EMERGENCIES ONLY", what do they think they are a fucking doctors office or something.
@_date: 2013-07-16 23:53:23
everything i posted is true
@_date: 2013-07-16 23:07:20
Yeah, anal retentive fools like you must be really helping out the bitcoin scene lol
