That's because vote brigading is against the sitewide rules, not just rediquette.
You're only expected to uphold reddit's [rules]( (which clearly states not to engage in voterigging) under an admin's eye. You can politely say no to enforcing rediquette (unless one or more of the bullets in there is also in the sitewide rules), since they're only *guidelines*, not the law.

"social credit" is a behavior index. It punishes behavior [like this]( as well [as this]( Many of you would be in favor of a similar system too, don't lie to yourselves.

Except what Warren said was completely true, you're comparing apples to oranges. At the time he said that, BTC was still well over $12K, and when people are in a mad rush to get in, Buffett says you should get out. If you got out as soon as he blew his kiss of doom, you were sitting very pretty to have bought the dip to $6K and expand your positions after the bloodshed in the streets, which on the flipside, is when Buffett says you should go in. For him to suggest otherwise (that crypto is something you should pile everything into right away), at least in the short term, would make him a hypocrite.
