well - 1. because such a market is a great mechanism to get on number from all this votes and 2.: the plan is the create liquidity on this market and to attrackt thos who know more.
I spend some time reading about the concept of a prediction market - maybe I assumed that people are familar with it - and obv. they are not.

finally one is making a start - thank you for reading all this stuff!
But one thing: I was expecting you to take one percentage for yes and no in the advanced form -&gt; thus the numbers you provided here (21.28 and 53.92) actually should sum up to 100.
a post should look like this:
I fund your yes bet anyway and if you provide a second correct version I fund this as well

well - of course I don't expect miracles from this action - but I expect to aggregate all the opinions of people that are around to one number. And if someone thinks he knows it better he can profit from it.

I could not find predictions on Gox on 
However here are some:  Did you read my initial post? ;)

Of coures I did


It sounds plausible what you are writing. However, I have read plausible statemets as well that were more optimistic. Saying they have more than the 200,000 BTC. Even with the 200,000 it should be possible to pay more than 2,5%.
This is exaclty why I want people how puts the money their money where their mouth is. If this action would result in a reliable information that the money is completly lost that would not be a pain in the ass but still better then having it lost AND not knowing it for sure.

I wish I had a good answer on this...
Part of the answer might be that I had even less trust in the security of my PC and I was too lazy to dug into paper wallets and stuff like this. In retroperspective this sounds hilarious... An additional factor was that I did not follow any Bitcoin news in the last weeks of Gox because this was a very bussy time for me.
I can not undo faults from the past but it would really be helpful to get clarity. And by the way - I would not expect this to cost me 10BTC in the end since I would make predictions on both outcomes on each event and always one has to come true. So I would basically only pay the "spread" between "yes" and "no" predictions...

with at least 20 numbers it will start to get an interesting shape...
@_date: 2014-08-26 16:28:29
ok - I take it as a yes anyway

actually I try to find out, would love to get some [help](
@_date: 2014-05-21 19:31:12
and to me there is still no plausible explanation what happend to the missing 500,000 BTC. That is the least I expect to get!
@_date: 2014-08-25 18:41:08
the idea is, that lots of people create a bet on what happend by MtGox. I will pay the bet. The market data that will result from this will show what the community thinks.
@_date: 2014-08-26 16:29:31
