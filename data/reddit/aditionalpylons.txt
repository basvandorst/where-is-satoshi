Seriously thank you. Changetip has been so impactful on myself and from what I see many others in the ability to adopt the use of the bitcoin currency. It's a seriously awesome thing, and it's making tons of people excited!

Ah, yeah now that I look into it, I see that even if you were to stay there awhile it would take a long time even to get the equivalent of 100 bits. Thanks for the heads up, and the gem!

The whole change tip popularity is awesome if you want bitcoins to be successful. It makes something that previously has seemed like a really daunting task to many a lot more approachable. I mean it definitely got me to hop the fence on something I couldn't fully grasp in the past.

Oh man, I totally agree with you on that! 100 satoshi @_date: 2014-11-06 09:18:59
Hahaha, what a good name for it.

Oh wow, that's actually pretty fun! Thanks for the heads up!

Check the guys post history. I feel you may be in for some disappointment...

I really love your list over there, it cleared up so much confusion/miscommunication that I had on things. I mean personally I am interested to know if any of these "bitcoin faucet" sites are legitimate or just a waste of time. Also interested if there's any related apps, or just small things people might not easily know about.

It's really awesome that not only did they do a massive giveaway, however they added many resources in to make it as approachable and easy for as many people as they could. I think that's what's truly awesome about this!

I see. I could definitely imagine if you had more than a few dollars invested here that you might want to consider better security, thanks for the heads up!

I've been trying to use the amount they give you from the faucet to actually get some amount that is withdrawable. Went double or nothing 9 times in a row and got close. I won't really consider putting money into it though haha

Out of curiosity, how would downloading your own personal wallet fare if you used a shared computer with others? Is it still a safer option?
