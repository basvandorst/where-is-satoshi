all the bitcoin community needs is a huge corporation to start accepting bitcoins and then we will get some many more bitcoiners

how do I go about setting her up with a coinbase merchant account bc I explained no transaction fees besides when she cashes out and they charge the 1% 
@_date: 2013-11-23 03:37:03
now if she sets up a coinbase account and sells the coins. how does she go about doing taxes on those earnings. and let's say someone orders a lot of food for 100 dollars and when she sells the that, it is now worth 200. is she gonna pay taxes on the 200 or the on the original order?
