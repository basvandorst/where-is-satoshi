Right.

Classic. lol

The only idiot here is you, friend. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 16:06:21
Calm down, Hillary. It's just a meme. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 16:36:29
Classic. lol
Edit: Looks like he deleted his last comment, but trust me, it's just as funny as your imagination thinks it is. Or the mods took it down. Still shows up on his account, but not the thread.

Why are you asking me if you weren't going to take my answer?
@_date: 2018-01-03 03:45:16
No. Noone gives a shit enough.

Probably not anything in the short term. ISP's probably don't want to make people too mad too fast. You'll probably see small and slow changes over time. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 17:20:41
lol I'm convinced this is just your troll account now.

The free market has attempted to help the poor with handouts in the past. Never seems to work. 
Edit: It makes me sad that this comment has been fluctuating in upvotes and downvotes. Objective facts are hard to cope with, I guess. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:17:14
What's your question here? lol
Yes, if you find something cheaper elsewhere, you get more value from that purchase.

Comments like this were the "most realistic" at $1k too. It's all speculation either way. I think positivity is much more productive than intentionally spreading FUD. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:13:29
AND THEN SUDDENLY BITCOIN JUMPS FROM $7K TO $50K.
It's all speculation, dude. I don't think fear mongering does anyone any good.

There's nothing "feel good" about it. I'm not your high school Economics teacher. Do your own research if you don't believe what I'm saying. I'm not going to post citations on a reddit comment. lol

The Korea ban dip happened last night/this morning. We went from around 18k to 14k. Honestly, with the heavy adoption we're having, I don't think we'll have a 50% drop.
@_date: 2017-12-29 20:40:14
Yes. Sell everything now. /s
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:38:48
Keep waiting, bud. It'll happen someday.

Everyone has a bias. You won't get around it. Just follow a positive community and then watch the mainstream news. Boom. Both ends of the spectrum.

On Coinbase? What are you using to buy? Credit, debit, or bank account?
@_date: 2018-05-14 00:55:00
An appeal to emotion only works if you're liberal.
Anything else and apparently you're an asshole. 
@_date: 2018-05-28 16:59:53
Ahctually there are 178 different ways it could go. 
@_date: 2018-10-14 19:23:14
I think you can make tax deductions on losses tho. 
@_date: 2019-06-24 20:23:38
If I never buy, it'll just go to 1 million. I'll stay out of crypto if one of you promises to be my sugar daddy.

My situation is true, but this is in fact a shit post. No need to be a Mr. Grumpy Gills.

If he's criticizing the Federal Reserve, then he's doing something right. Might be bad for bitcoin if he actually addresses problems with our current currency. 
@_date: 2018-07-18 12:35:05
That was actually really well explained. 
@_date: 2019-05-23 12:05:24
And now you're veering off topic.

I didn't imply they *all* had guns, but having an armed population didn't hurt. Imagine how it would have went if none of them had weapons.

Let me introduce you to a little war that happened in Vietnam.
