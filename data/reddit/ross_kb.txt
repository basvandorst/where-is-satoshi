The last part is a double top pattern in tech analysis... Google it..

Never said it is easy, but doesn't mean you don't try to react to the market.

I don't get the hodl long term mentality. If you think it's going down, sell. If you think it's rising, buy. Even if you think it will rise over time you make more money by riding the waves both up and down. Of course, no one knows if it will rise or fall, but there are people who say ya, it will fall but I'm hodling because it will rise over time. That is the illogical part. The whales make money by exactly having people hodl regardless of anything, so  the market becomes to easy to manipulate when they pump and pull their multi millions.

Traders get rekt precisely due to the stubborn mentality.. they hodl until the price drops too low until they panic sell, only to have it rebound after. Or they buy on a high thinking it's doing to rise tenfold and it falls.

Those veterans who hodl from 17k to 5k learnt their lesson that they should have sold and reentered at 5k.. people learn from their mistakes, not repeat them..

I said react.
@_date: 2019-05-15 23:12:58
When it drops to 4k it will be on a steep downslope and you will not buy it.

You have poor upbringing.

Same they would have gone through that same crash and regretted.
@_date: 2019-05-17 19:13:28
Both holding or not holding doesn't grant you the ability to see the future.
@_date: 2019-05-17 19:09:51
They would have more coins and more profit if they had sold and rebought. That was the lesson.
@_date: 2019-05-17 19:03:56
Exactly. They thought they had the supernatural power to foresee the bull runs forever but now have learnt something from that.
@_date: 2019-05-19 14:13:40
You're actually right. Good luck with your hodling, keep it up :)
@_date: 2019-05-18 08:11:14
I said the same thing and people were flaming me. They think it's all about buy and hodl.
@_date: 2019-05-14 15:44:51
I don't think there will be FOMO rush like last time, because most of those people already got burned the last time. What do you think? In fact, once there is a sell pressure all those people who held on will be rushing to sell and lock in their gains, learning from their mistake from last round.

That's like saying " I think it will rise so I'm not going to think about it". It doesn't take out the guesswork, it just means being fixed on what you guessed. Like you said, you shouldn't presume to be correct thinking it will rise or fall. Be like water, react to the environment..
