Wow, you may just be the luckiest guy on Reddit right now.

Why are people so infatuated with these vending machines??
@_date: 2014-08-05 04:35:52
They can't... anyone can go and put a fake id barcode on a piece of plastic and bypass their "kyc standards". Lamasu is compete garbage, don't be fooled.

Look another vending machine. How original....
@_date: 2014-06-30 00:21:51
These machines are not worth the investment

Just fyi folks not taking any kyc/aml info for Bitcoin transactions will get you in serious trouble. People on localbitcoins are getting fined and sometimes imprisoned for doing exactly what this operator is doing. You will likely see this machine's kyc standards changed in the near future, don't be fooled.

Lol talk about giving operators a false sense of security... 
@_date: 2014-07-05 00:25:30
That looks so secure!!!

Who makes your atm?

Yeah except if you operate one without a license you are putting yourself at risk for heavy fines and possible jail time.

I doubt taking only a cell phone number for transactions up to $3000 will keep the operator licensed and/or out of jail. Can you walk into a bank and deposit/withdraw up to $3000 using just a phone number? In the courts eyes these two scenarios are one n the same. Not at all worth the risk
