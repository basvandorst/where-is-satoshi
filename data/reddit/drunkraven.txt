We need to think it the other way around. In the future, Bitcoin will be a energy-based currency, as energy costs will be the main cost factor in mining. If bitcoin becomes more valuable, it might be an incentive to use energy wiser.  
Another main point is also that the total energy expended to mine bitcoin will be far lower than the "energetic market capitalization" of bitcoin, because of the rising price. Therefore, bitcoin not so much costs energy, it symbolizes energy.
Also, Bitcoin can foster the use of renewable energy, because bitcoin has no storage problem. And it's energy storage which poses the remaining barrier for renewable sources.

You are perhaps in a logical fallacy here. You say that because anybody can get a key signed and a web of trust contains all people which have at least one key signed, you'd need to trust everyone. Very clearly, bad people can get some key signed by somebody else who is either collaboratoing intentionally or just not careful.
**But this is not how it works.**
The web of trust is  modeled after the real-world-way in which we handle trust. Almost everyone trusts some people. Thus, almost are people in the world are connected by a trust graph. **However that does very obviously NOT mean that one has either to trust everyone in the world, or nobody.** And the fact that you can't trust everyone does not mean that the concept of trust is worthless. 
All the problem you construct comes from black-and-white thinking. Try to think in trust as some probability estimate of of not fucking up, and look at some probability theory.

You use strong words. FUD means spreading "Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt" by issuing false or misleading information. Now, show me that something is wrong what I posted.


I am not sure whether you did understand my original post. it shows specifically that the key of ThomasV is not connected to the key of Mark Shuttleworth, which is part of the "strong set" of the web of trust. In case you don't know - Mark Shuttleworth is the owner of Canonical and leader of the Ubuntu Linux distribution, he is very well connected as he also founded Thawte, a SSL certificate authority. 
Of course, ThomasV keys and these of his coworkers can be (and are) connected between each other to a smaller web of trust, but this does not give them that much credibility as anyone who wants to spoof Electrum can do that alone using a few freshly created mail addresses.
And to say something to the quality of your argument: You accuse me of FUD and try to shame me because of my post. But experiencing fear or uncertainty is nothing to be ashamed of - fear is simply an emotion which about any living being which moves autonomously NEEDS just in order to survive. Uncertainty or doubt are natural for intelligent people if crucial information is missing. And yes, personally, I'd call information about the authenticity of software which I am supposed to trust thousands of bucks "crucial".
And if I  know something, then it is that "security by shame" works even worse than "security by obscurity". This is because shame, because of some deep psychological reason, very often is employed in order to hide the truth.

Some people might overlook this, but: **Without control of what a program does, you need absolute trust in the developer of that software.** It is irrational to use closed source software for Bitcoin. The equivalent would be to give some random bank clerk full legal powers to empty  your bank account.
@_date: 2014-06-22 18:41:27


That really depends on the area. Open source software shines at things like software development, internet services and scientific computing. I think when you pair things like Scientific Python / MATLAB, Apache / IIS or git / MS Team Foundation Server, you often have a much better product in the open source camp. This is not only because of the code - it is an entirely different handling of knowledge.
An area which still lags is usability and interface design. This has a number of reasons, but among them is that usability is not easy. Also, enhanced usability is of little value if the core software is not stable and reliable. 
That said, we are seeing a lot of improvements in usability and design, and I think this really matters for a very large fraction of potential users. Also, while good design isn't possibility without creativity, usability engineering is a knowledge-based, evidence-driven, evolutionary activity, and there is no reason to think that the open source model will be less powerful here.
Edit: The same goes for Bitcoin software, of course.

I think this *could* be an important trend. What's happening is that at one hand, the speed of technological advances in mining is slowing down as current technologies are approached. At the same time, there is a growing incentive for mass production of ASIC layouts, similar to mass production of digital watches, pocket calculators, desktop processors and so on. This will end up at chip costs of a few dollars each. Not sure about that, but the combination of both trends *could* lead to a decentralization of mining.
@_date: 2014-06-26 08:25:13
No. The reason is precisely that starting conditions are not equal and we observe that inequalities tend to increase.
For example, in a purely capitalist system, good schools are unaffordable to poor people. Taxes can be used for education, and this increases the wealth of the society. I don't see a capitalist society is able to solve that.
@_date: 2014-07-08 05:20:26


Entropy can only increase. What you mean is that our technology consumes something which is called [exergy]( by scientists. The idea that wealth (or as I like it more to put it, satisfaction of human needs) is proportional to exergy usage is true **as long as you stick with a given technology**. One can increase efficiency, however this is not trivial to do.


Especially in transport, almost all of your economy is based on fossil fuels. You can run a car by a battery (albeit a motorcycle would be far more efficient for the objective to transport persons). But you cannot run trucks, freight ships or planes on battery.


Something that has energy (or more precisely, usable exergy)  in common with bitcoin is that you cannot borrow it from nature. Outside of quantum mechanics, there is no such thing as negative energy, and this is a main reason why energy problems cause quickly instabilities in financial systems. If you'd like to read more about that, I can recommend [Gail Tverberg's blog](


Fusion is not renewable. Current fusion technologies are also mostly based on tritium which needs to be generated by conventional nuclear fission, powered by uranium. However, solar and wind is getting cheaper very quickly (which we can already note by its usage in bitcoin mining).


This is a vast understatement of the problem we have with energy. We need either to substitute almost **all** of our energetic infrastructure within a few decades, or our civilization will simply kick the bucket. Imagine, this includes all cars, highways, airports, housing,international goods transport, international trade, and food production. Today, nothing of this works without huge amounts of fossile energy.
This is completely unprecedented in human history. We are about eight billion of people on this planet, but within few decades we could have only resources and food for a few hundred millions. If I really think about this, I become freightened as shit.

I think [Elementary OS]( (which is a successful new Linux distribution improving on Ubuntu) is a good example for sucessful and effective funding, and it's also relevant to Bitcoin.
Why? Well, for many Bitcoin users it became  evident in the last months that it is good to be more independent from Apple's business decisions. We also have seen some amount of MacOS malware.
High-quality open source software offer more security and better privacy protection than closed source software ever can. But for the same reason for which a storm-proof house needs a good foundation,  this is more effective when the whole OS is open source. It's the base that matters.
However, many Apple users miss (quite understandable) the interface consistency, relative simplicity and good looks of OSX and stick so far with Apple products. If you [look at Elementary OS Luna]( it is really starting to offer an alternative.

So, for the case of automobiles, we know what happened - driving in a car engineered for safety turned out to be the more comfortable and advantageous option. The same will be true for the platforms which offer Bitcoin integration.
And no, I don't think this will be a pretty or painless process. As with automobiles and security belts, many people learned the necessity by the hard way.

Copying myself from  :
I think this (Bitcoin's political neutrality) is true in a much more general way than you realize. People here at tend to identify bitcoin with their very special political orientation. They even think that a success of Bitcoin would be equivalent with a success of Libertarism.
But the fact is, in other parts of society, and in other parts of the world, things like Libertarism are mostly irrelevant. In spite of that, Bitcoin is gathering support in very different countries, from East Asia to Scandinavia. I invite you to try to hold for five seconds the idea that the economic model in countries like Finland or Sweden is, form the point of view of an US libertarian, more or less pure communism. 
But these countries are embracing bitcoin, too. This proves that Bitcoin is way more political neutral than you think. Without doubts, there is a growing dissatisfaction with the current monetary and banking system, among many political factions. But doing a deep look, the problems in China are not fundamentally different from the US. They do not restrict Bitcoin for ideological reasons. They restrict it because their banking system is unstable and they do not want to light the fuse to that. In the meantime, the US government has taken measures which mostly commonizes costs and privatzes profits. If you want to call this capitalism, it's a terminally ill one. 
This is bad and good. It is bad for those which think that Bitcoin will force other people or countries to adopt their economic model and their social system, or lack thereof. If you think that the  Swedish will cease to pay taxes because they have bitcoin, dream on - they have a very different notion about well-being than the American dream. This isn't to say that Bitcoin is apolitical, it is simply that it's political agenda is decentralization, like the agenda of the printing press was knowledge.
However it is good for Bitcoin, because without a fundamental neutrality, Bitcoin cannot be a success. Money needs to connect people.
Well, if you want to recognize that fact, you can take the political groups out of the sidebar here. They are not helpful any more anyway.
**Edit:** As a side note, many people seem to believe naively that a wide adoption of  bitcoin will make it technically impossible to raise taxes. They seem to imply that, taxes can be raised *only* on bank transfers and fiat money and that before fiat and modern banking, there were no taxes. I **do** think that bitcoin can make taxes and public spending  more transparent and can surely help to decentralize social organization, but lets face it, taxes go back to ancient human history like Egypt's pharaos, the Mesoptamian kings and probably the very first cities and kingdoms. In so far, taxes are not bound to fiat money or electronic banking in any way.
That does not disminish the value of bitcoin, but it's just realistic that assuming a wide adoption, taxes would be raised in some other way. A way which I would personally favour are import taxes on imported fossil energy sources replacing taxes on work income, as this would solve several problems, among the most urgent ones man-made climate change and the dangerous depletion of fossil fuel sources which today are vital for any modern society.
And now, if you want to start a tax discussion, have a look at that graphic - and explain me how it comes that OECD countries with high tax rates include some of the most well-off societies like Norway, Sweden, Finland, France, and The Netherlands, while  countries with very low tax rates include quite poor members of OECD like Mexico, Greece and Turkey. I get that libertarians don't like taxes much. **If you want to say that low taxes induce collective prosperity, you'd need to explain why this data clearly contradicts it:**

Also, the current system is paradoxical, because it does not work without credit, and credit does not work without trust. At the same time, it does not work without power, and power will ultimately destroy a any reason for trust.
However, there are some real issues with Bitcoin that the article points out and which are worth discussing.

Maybe a pool cannot abuse a 51 % hashrate for a double spend attack quickly and without being noticed, but it already has too much power that can be abused in other ways. 
For example, a 51 % hashrate is sufficient to block changes to the protocol - maybe changes which stop further growth of the influence of that pool, maybe urgent protocol changes which are needed to keep the network alive. In other words, once a pool gets so much hashrate, this can already be a point of no return.

You have to be picky about which signatures you do trust. I fail to see how this is less secure than trusting in forum posts of people I don't know.


If you pick the right people which know what they do, a trust path with three or four hops is pretty acceptable in my opinion.


Totally relying on the webpage where the software in question is offered is less secure.


Again: THE BITCOINTALK FORUM HAS BEEN HACKED. TWICE. Which means that any information in it is compromised and cannot be trusted.
And, the order of the signing is no strong cue, for two reasons: First, it must be possible to revoke keys and replace them by newer keys if the old ones are compromised. And second, the time stamps in the GPG signatures are not cryptographically strong time stamps as entries in the bitcoin block chain. They are determined by the system on which the signature is made, and are thus under control of the signer.

I am not sure whether this is feasible, too, as I only have limited understanding. It's indeed probable that there is a hidden gotcha.


Pools are anyway more a problem than a solution. But I am not sure how much time-locking coins would actually affect them.


This is true. Maybe the current situation is less stable than before because hardware becomes obsolete so quickly. As the technology gets closer to the state-of-the-art, and speed gains will become slower,  this problem should become smaller.
And anyway, if miners have an incentive to protect the network, why do so many behave that way? A lacking coupling of risk/disadvantage and reward is my best explanation.

I really don't see the advantage to use closed source apps or a closed source platform. You need to trust 100 % in the developer of that app, and in the OS vendor.

**Yes.** So far, such package managers are not used to spread malware. Consequently, this is not "absolutely secure" but certainly more secure than running untrusted software.
Or put in other words, if you install a Linux distro you need to decide which one to trust. Once you have done that, you usually need to jump through several hoops before you can run something untrusted. It's no problem to shoot your whole foot off using Linux, but you would first need to find out how to do that.

For the time being, I think it is good enough.
However, it is not a perfect solution. Things that can still happen:
* Windows malware could access and alter data on your Linux partition. To access Linux filesystems, specific drivers are needed but these exist. If you want to counter that, using BTRFS might be a smart choice.
* Malware similar to cryptolocker could also encrypt or overwrite your Linux partition.
* Windows malware can modify your BIOS firmware and activate itself on boot-up. This is currently not a mayor concern but such malware exists, at least as proof-of-concept:
    
To counter such possibilities, it would be much safer to encrypt the Linux partition. Of course, malcious attempt of modification might make it unusable, so keeping backups is even more important.
It would be more secure to run Windows only from inside a virtual machine. In this case, it is quite improbable that malware breaks out and does anything to the Linux system. 
As always, you need to weight the risk and the additional hassle. As long as you are not targeted by a high-profile adversary, I think the actual risk is pretty small.

This is true, too. Also the Armory-offline mode is a good and very effective security concept. But Linux users should think more about losing access to well-secured wallets by missing passwords, fire, flood and the like. Up to now, losing access to private keys is by far the biggest risk for them.

I found one result of that poll interesting: Already 21 % of Reddit's Bitcoin holders use Linux. 
This is interesting because the lower incidence of malware problems on Linux has been attributed to the lower adoption Linux has. The argument goes like that: If some specific group of people (say, red-haired identical twins) is affected rarely by some problem (let say, being involved in a car accident), this does not mean that this specific group has less risk. The cause could rather be that red-haired identical twins are rare. And as a result, being one of them does not balance for a poor driving style.
Contrarily, a Linux user share of 21 % is a pretty significant portion. Compared to that, reports of Linux users losing their bitcoins due to malware are extremely uncommon. Therefore, one can conclude that Linux users are, so far, indeed actually much less likely to lose their coins to malware authors.
There is, however, one reservation which has to be made. Using Linux does not automagically protects people with poor habits. In fact, I think one important aspect which makes Linux "safer" is that it nourishes a very different security culture. 
For example, usually there is a strict distinction between "data" and "programs", and running untrusted programs is strongly frowned upon. Also, a system which had ever any sort of security incident (such as a rootkit) counts as "compromised" and will normally not be used again, but replaced by a freshly installed system - if possible, after identifying and plugging the hole which made the security breach possible. So, something like "disinfecting" a virus-infested system, which is a quite common thinking pattern in the Windows world, would be rarely done by Linux users, because such a machine could still have any kind of backdoor. If people really want to enjoy the potential security benefit which is possible with Linux, they should be prepared for a fundamental change of habits.

I think this is true in a much more general way than you realize. People here at tend to identify bitcoin with their very special political orientation. They even think that a success of Bitcoin would be equivalent with a success of Libertarism.
But the fact is, in other parts of society, and in other parts of the world, things like Libertarism are mostly irrelevant. In spite of that, Bitcoin is gathering support in very different countries, from East Asia to Scandinavia. I invite you to try to hold for five seconds the idea that the economic model in countries like Finland or Sweden is, form the point of view of an US libertarian, more or less pure communism. 
But these countries are embracing bitcoin, too. This proves that Bitcoin is way more political neutral than you think. Without doubts, there is a growing dissatisfaction with the current monetary and banking system. But doing a deep look, the problems in China are not fundamentally different from the US. They do not restrict Bitcoin for ideological reasons. They restrict it because their banking system is unstable and they do not want to light the fuse to that. In the meantime, the US government has taken measures which mostly commonizes costs and privatzes profits. If you want to call this capitalism, it's a terminally ill one. 
This is bad and good. It is bad for those which think that Bitcoin will force other people or countries to adopt their economic model and their social system, or lack thereof. If you think that the  Swedish will cease to pay taxes because they have bitcoin, dream on - they have a very different notion about well-being than the American dream. This isn't to say that Bitcoin is apolitical, it is simply that it's political agenda is decentralization, like the agenda of the printing press was knowledge.
However it is good for Bitcoin, because without a fundamental neutrality, Bitcoin cannot be a success. Money needs to connect people.
Well, if you want to recognize that fact, you can take the political groups out of the sidebar here. They are not helpful any more anyway.

It is a hint in that direction, yes, and it can be useful in certain situations. But bing able to log in into some account and write a message is nowhere as secure as a strong cryptographic proof. You need to trust that the person protects her password, that the OS update keys for his computer have been kept confidential, that the reddit admins keep their servers safe, that there took no man-in-the-middle attack place when the person signed in, and many things more. There is a chain of trust here, too, only that the GPG chain of trust employs strong public key cryptography and the trust relationships are way more visible.
And as said, a forum post is no safe proof because forums can be hacked, and the bitcointalk forum already has been hacked two times. That means that also posts as the one above can be altered.

I actually have good arnachist friends. There are two points which seem to count against pure Libertrarism or Anarcho-Capitalism for me.
One is that Libertarians simply seem to dismiss the fact that collective societal instituions like school or a public health system can make live better for a huge majority of people. As long as this is in the interest of the majority, this does not require an authoritarian state, only (well, big "only") a working democrary.
The second thing is that I lived for some time in a third-world contry where government was virtually absent and nothing was done for normal people. If you cannot pay school books for your kid there, it will not have books. If you have diabetes, you are fucked, because normal people can't pay the treatment. If you have a road accident, you better have a loaded credit card in your pocket, because your emergency treatment will depend on your ability to pay. And when you went out to street at night, you were at a big risk to be robbed by children which would kill you for as little as five dollars.
I do not want to live in a society like that. I live in a european country where health insurance is mandatory and affordable for every working person and their family, and I can't just wrap my head around how a society as rich as the US can do without that.

If one of the two systems is compromised, it would be still pretty safe to access the compromised system from the uncompromised system, but not the other way around. The hacker would need to break out of VNC, and to do that he would first need to become aware of it. I can't imagine such a break-out is automated by current malware.
If you have very high security demands, it would be helpful to isolate network access of the Windows computer. It is possible to restrict its connection so that it cannot access the internet directly. But this needs clearly additional effort, and might not be worth the extra work.
In any case, separating both systems to different hardware and connecting by VNC would be a big gain in security.

This is what credit card companies already do. it would also be expensive. To use an ecological metaphor, this is the ecological niche of creit cards, and Bitcoin has to find another place.
I think that Bitcoin has more a future as electronic cash. There are many types of transactions where vendor and buyer can establish trust between themselves. For example, in remittance payments made by migrant workers, or in relatively small recurrent payments such as metro tickets, or in situations where the payment goes along with some amount of mutual committment, such as renting a hotel room or buying a flight.
In this case, using middleman to abritrate trust has additional costs, but no real advantage. I think this are the scenarios where Bitcoin will thrive.

I don't think money is necessarily debt. Fiat money is debt by the fact that it is ultimately needed to pay taxes, and it is also created based on debt.
But as a counter-example, gold or silver coins can obviously be money but they are not debt. If you have an IOU which I signed and gave to somebody else, I have a debt to you and you can in some way force be to oblige that. If you have a gold coin and want to trade with me, I am free to accept that - at least on the theory level, things might be different if I am starving and need money to buy food.
This does not mean that Bitcoin is necessarily debt-free. It is entirely possible to write an IOU which is nominated in Bitcoin, to lend Bitcoins and to do fractional reserve banking with it. As long as Bitcoin is deflating, this is probably not wise, but it is possible; and in some future, it might not deflate any more.
Now the thing is that, similarly as posessing an IOU for a ounce of gold is something different from actually posessing an ounce of gold, **it is different to have an IOU for some amount of Bitcoin (say, on the server of a Japanese currency exchange), and actually posessing some amount of Bitcoin**. This is a critical difference and the general public will probably take considerable time to understand that difference.

Why? taz is small but well-respected and politically quite influential.

This is one reason why I think it's huge - Bitcoin needs to grow beyond purely libertarian, US-centric circles, and I think it can because in some way, trade and commerce are great intermediaries - in the long term, a force stronger than war.
Further, because of common roots and its location, it is still well connected to the somewhat anarchist/libertarian  [Bitcoin Kiez community]( in Berlin. And like many small newspapers, taz is quite struggling to open new sources of income as the traditional ways to fund journalism are dwindling.

Hey Jim, thanks for your reply!

What you want to say is "Linux has a small userbase".  But this argument does not hold. First, Linux runs the mayority of all internet servers, and has proven better security than Windows machines. Second, it forms the base of all Android devices, Third, the mayority of cable modems and DSL routers run Linux, and they are constantly under attack.
The argument with the small user base does also not hold for corporate and organizational users. Large companies like Google have switched to Linux and MacOS entirely because of better security. Citities like Munich have switched almost all their desktop workplaces to Linux.
And the argument does hold **even less** for Bitcoin users - **according to a recent survey, 21 % of reddits bitcoin users use Linux, and they have almost not problems with malware**:


This is flawed, too. Developing malware nowadays is not done for fun, it is because criminals can make money from that. It is essentially an economic activity, and Malware for Linux is almost absent because **it is just not economical**. 
The reason for this is threefold: One is indeed the smaller user base. But more important are two other aspects: For several reasons, it is much harder to exploit Linux - a more stringent separation of user and system roles, more layers of security, protections like GRSecurity, AppArmor and SELinux which were protected **proactively**. and a much clearer separation between untrusted data and trusted software which is allowed to run on a user's computer.
The third important aspect is the security culture of the Linux community - Linux stems from the first networked time-sharing systems which were developed with protecting private data in mind, and this has deeply permeated the culture and best practices. This also has the consequence that **working securely on Linux is comfortable**, for example if you install a program from a package manager, the binaries and all libraries they depend on are digitally signed, and the software checks it for you. Also, all packeges are updated automatically, with distributions like Linux Mint Debian Edition even doing a rolling release cycle so that your systems never becomes out-dated.


No, because by the combination of the three factors - smaller user base, better security architecture and technical protection, and better security culture - it will remain uneconomical to attack Linux for a long time.
Some people think that limiting Linux usage for security-critical applications like Bitcoin would enhance security for the smaller number of users. This is flawed. If somebody runs a food store and wants to keep cockroaches out of that, he does not hide the food in places where the cockroaches do not find it. The right strategy is to keep the whole food store clean and to not tolerate bugs.
With the bitcoin ecosystem, it is jiust the same as with a food store. If security is too poor, there will be horrible infestations which affect the whole ecosystem. The right strategy is to clean malware out by using safe systems.


I have another suggestion:
For storing larger amount of bitcoin, **get a cheap netbook with Linux pre-installed**, for example a Thinkpad Edge 135 or a Acer or Asus notebooks, which is supported by the vendor, such as these:
By using pre-installed Linux, one can be sure that the hardware is supported and that there is no hassle to set up the OS. This can save tons of time, and, be honest, most people wouldn't want to set up Windows themselves either.
Another advantage is that Linux will be cheaper for the same performance, as it has less hardware requirements, especially when running light Desktops like Gnome classic, Mint MATE or XFCE. In fact, these desktops are completely good for older XP hardware, but I'd suggest again to save the time and get a pre-installed device.
An the other hand, for using bitcoins daily, I suggest to switch the main OS to Linux and run the remaining Windows programs in a virtual machine so that they are sandboxed. To repeat, **the insecure OS must be sandboxed, not the Bitcoin software**. Doing it the other way would mean to put the cart before the horse.
The second solution is exactly what is needed for mass adoption of Bitcoin, because the mayority of computer users have by far not the skills to run a windows system even halfways secure.

What do you mean? Miners will get exactly the same amount of BTC. They just will have to wait three months until they can cash their BTC out. 
Sure it can happen that some pool gets 70 % hashrate, 51 % attacks are carried out, and the price of bitcoin goes to zero as a result. Is this the problem of other bitcoin users?   If these miners don't want to lose money due to a collapsing network, they are free to organize themselves, get their shit together, and distribute their pool participation in a way that it does not destabilize the whole network. It is as easy as that.
Or to put it more bluntly - why should other people carry the risks that *some* miners create for perhaps  0.2% more profit for themselves ?

But OP wrote:


So, if (and only if) you run Windows as a guest in a virtual machine with a Linux host system, your Linux system would be protected.  The point is that this would require to do any bitcoin-related stuff in Linux (the host system) and any execution of unsafe programs in the guest system. The disadvantage is that you are still running some software of a lower security level. The plus is that you can use Windows stuff you can't easily get rid of without problems.
Here are a few pointers which discuss that kind of setup:


Learning to master Linux will cost time and patience, this is true. But I think that the effort to install Linux and do trivial things is often over-estimated, especially if you use a  distribution geared to beginners, like Ubuntu or Linux Mint. You can have it up and running within one hour, and you can try out via the live systems on USB sticks whether your hardware is well enough supported. 
What would make the switch easier for you is if you already use either a web mailer for email, or a cross-platform program like Thunderbird.
There exist even a big plus for installing Windows in VMs: When using a VM, you usually do not have any driver problems because the "virtual" computer is one that is well supported by all guest systems.
Also, Linux has no problems with handling large directories and files which represent the VM system images. Therefore, it is easy to delete a botched virtual system and just to create and start a fresh copy from a backup image.
@_date: 2014-05-10 15:29:49


This is true, but it is seldom necessary to install such shit and to somewhat experienced Linux users the invitation to do that will clearly ring alarm bells.
I note it with myself - when I do paid work on Windows, I work with much lower security standards because it is very difficult to get something done otherwise, and because no one else does this.

@_date: 2014-04-07 07:20:43
First, it won't help mass adoption if there are tens of thousands of naive people using Bitcoin on Windows which lose all their savings to malware. They will be angry as fuck and you can be sure they won't try Bitcoin again. As soon as Bitcoin get's really popular, the time fuse is ticking for a major outbreak of targeted malware.
And second, as it is extremely hard to secure a desktop system which was never designed with security in mind, I think a more widespread use of Bitcoin is an excellent incentive of mass adoption of Linux systems.
Maybe the comment wants to imply that it is difficult to run Linux. But today, it is really more difficult to re-install Windows one of those Laptops which come preimaged with tons of crapware and bloat. Installing something like [Linux Mint Debian Edition]( usually boils down to come up with a computer name and a good admin password. It's a matter of twenty minutes and it can be very, very easily installed on a old machine which runned Windows XP, or on a cheap 200-Dollar Acer Netbook bought by Amazon. Maybe it's not the best choice to start using Windows directly for everything, but it is a very great choice to use it for an offline Armory wallet with an absolute minimum of costs and hassle.

Yes. The sensible way is to run Windows in the VM.


I don't see any problem performance-wise. But whoever controls the host computer, can also control the VM, for example, by using a keylogger. Therefore the more insecure system should go into the VM and Bitcoin should live on the host system, or another VM which is never used for any other purpose.
If you handle amounts which loss would make you cry, you should definitively use separate hardware, like a Raspberry Pi.

No. I want to take miners take a little responsibility for the medium-term stability of bitcoin.
Presently, new coins have a maturation period after mining, for security reasons. They are not freely spendable then either, only the period is shorter. **After** that period, coins are freely movable. I certainly don't suggest to change the latter.
Also, at current low interest rates, the costs of three months of bound capital are very, very low. What such a measure **will** do is to increase the risk for miners if they continue to concentrate around the biggest pool. But miners are free, too. **They have choice** to organize themselves, get their shit together, and make agreements which lower their risk of fucking it up. And they have certainly control about what they do, so why shouldn't they have responsibility?
Also, I think my suggestion is agreeable because it affects everyone the same, putting none of the miners into disadvantage while reducing the risk that their expenses are lost due to detoriating trust in Bitcoin.
There are also other factors. Mining hardware continues to get cheaper per hash power. This process will not stop before a price of a few bucks per chips has been reached, because the marginal costs of chip production (unit costs per chip) are so low. 
This is an important opportunity to make mining more decentralized, because new miners can start with less capital costs.

Using multiple signatures improves some security - it helps clearly to keep the keys confidential. Hardware wallets do that, too.
Unfortunately, this does not address the main problem: You don't use the computer only to keep your keys and sign transactions, you also use it for things like browsing for things or services you are going to buy - frequently, your whole descisionmaking depends on it. Now, when your computer is mad (=compromised), and you have an offer for, say, a car or a flight ticket, how can you be secure that the address you are going to pay to is indeed the address of the vendor of your ticket ?
If your computer is compromised, you can't be sure that your browser displays what is actually in the remote web page. You still can't be sure that your password is not retreived. You can't be sure that mails you receive meet your eyes unaltered. You can't be sure that the bitcoin wallet you use is not replaced by something malicious.
Yes, your private keys might be safe until you you use them, but what if the whole transaction you are sending is based on false information?

Oh, just want to add that: The Debian project employs keysigning religiously, and many Debian people are very, very well connected to the "Strong Set" of the web of trust (which is basically, the largest connected graph in the graph of PGP keys). I am sure they would be pleased to help you with more signatures.
@_date: 2014-06-14 15:05:40
Therefore my suggestion is that the maturing time of freshly mined coins should be gradually extended to at least three months or maybe even more. In other words, any newly mined coins should not be spendable before that time has elapsed. If this is implemented, miners will have at least a proper mid-term interest that the network does not collapse.
@_date: 2014-03-31 07:25:11


That's indeed not the correct use. My own keys are in the strong set and connected via the Debian project.

If you weight risk and reward, you'll see very quickly that the risk isn't worth the gain. It is like omitting fire alarm boxes when you build an hotel, because fire alarm boxes do cost money, and your guests could call the fire brigade with their cell phone as well.
Or to put it more mathematical: put
C_breakdown = the cost of the bitcoin network breaking down (**this is your whole hardware investment**)
P_breakdown = the risk it happens if centralized mining is continued (about 100 %)
and compare that to
C_switch =  the cost of you going to another pool (around 0.16 % of your earnings, I think)
P_switch = the probability that you have to pay that ( 100 % )
So, the question is
C_breakdown * P_breakdown &gt; C_switch * P_switch  ?
You won't argue that the second value is larger?
Or in other words, would you pay a 0.16 % insurance fee on your earnings if this insures you against loosing your whole investment due to a 51 % attack ?
I think it's a no-brainer.


There is a cure for that - communication and coordination.
@_date: 2014-06-19 07:43:30
It is not true that miners have incentive to destroy bitcoin. Read here:
What you claim with "act selfishly" is that the miners act to their own detriment because they will not communicate or coordinate what they do. But this is not rational behaviour.

But this is not possible for Windows, because the problem is not the bitcoin software but the lacking protection by the OS. In theory, yes, the Windows kernel can separate processes from each other. But in the desktop system, this was never really carried out, and now it is too late. You can't add security to a finished system, because security is a concern which affects all aspects of design, how programs communicate, and so on.
Just as an example: If You want to be safe against man-in-the-middle or man-in-the-browser attacks, you need to be sure that:
* Your desktop GUI and your browser display what a webpage actually says.
* The security certificates which your browser uses are intact and correct
* The emails you receive are unaltered
* Private keys which you print reach you printer correctly, and don't end up anywhere else.
* Passwords which you enter into the keyboard are not spoofed and transmitted elsewhere.

2. Don't use bitcoin at all, and lose the opportunity which it offers.
3. Use another system.
I am sure most people will try to get away cheap and try option 1. 
This is a perfectly valid choice. And we will see whether that works.

Well, I think there is azt least some big overlap with grassroots democracy. I think little can be said against a process of more democratization, and a huge majority of people would support that - and I think this is a main reason why Bitcoin has supporters from many sectors of society, maybe excluding the few people who extually benefit from authoritarian tendencies.
Thanks for your book tips. I have honestly to say that I do not know enough about anarchist theory, and I should leran more about that.

You can't stop them.
I do not imply that I want companies to make debt for this, either.
But the commenters point was that mining would become too expensive if the maturing period would be hugely extended. To judge that, one needs to look at the costs. And the costs (as long as you don't count the exchange rate risk to these costs) are very low because of low capital costs. You need to look at the interest rates to assess the costs correctly.

The point is not that somebody can expect from software not to have bugs but that developing such critical software means a lot of responsibility. The Therac-25 example (as well as the recent Toyota car control case) shows clearly that such bugs are much more likely to occur when development is not handled responsibly.

I think the whole concept of detecting malware is seriously flawed. 
If you have a purse with 1000 dollars in it, you wouldn't put it well-visible into your hip pocked while walking through a crowded place, and at the some time using a catalogue of known pickpockets to defend it. As ridiculous at it sounds, this is what antivirus and antimalware software does.

Well, when using hydroelectric or other renewables, the real cost structure is actually that you have to cover costs for a specific amount of installed power (wattage). This power is then sold to customers on the basis of delivered energy (Joules, or kWh).
Interestingly, this cost structure is very similar for renewables and for nuclear. It is different from fossil carriers because here, fuel costs are significant.

Two things:
The blockchain implements a decentralized, secure digital ledger over an untrusted network. It does that by using cryptography. However, to use the blockchain, **you need secure endpoints and trusted systems for your communication**.
To put it in a powerful picture, **bitcoin solves the byzantine general's problem** of communicating with partners over untrusted channels, thus allowing the armies to determine a safe time to attack. However, the solutions does not protect an army against the mishap that their general is mad and incapable of rational decisions. 
If your computer has malware, it is just like a **mad general**. You can't trust it for anything, even if the communications he receives are secure.
This is why secure endpoint systems are needed for bitcoin.
The second aspect: I know it's frustrating to deal with. I think in many cases, the best solution will be to sandbox the Windows system in a virtual machine. That does not make it safe, but it makes it easier to restrict its usage to the necessary tasks, to contain infections, and to recover a compromised system simply by overwriting the rotten virtual image with a uncompromised clean one.

One thing: My OP was intended to highlight the difficulty to verify certain important keys. It is NOT intended as a complete GPG instruction manual. Especially, I don't say that any key can or should be completely trusted because it is in some web of trust. The web of trust gives information about trust paths which allow it to verify information about key ownership - not more, not less. You have to weight this information with what you know.




You are taking a black-and-white view here, which is absolutely not how it is intended. With gpg, you can assign several levels of trust to each signature - not trusted, marginal trust, key verified, damn sure. These trust levels are included in each signature and you can check them. It is not recommended to rely on a single long chain of signatures. As you say correctly, this would be careless as long chains reach any number of people and there will be people with bad intentions among them.
However, for important identities - such as Bitcoin software - you can be picky about the people whose signatures you trust directly. I am picky about that. If you exchange keys with somebody and he does not ask for unequivical personal identification, chances are that his other signatures do not merit the highest level of trust. Further, the concept is to combine several trust paths with marginal turst so that they are weithed like one path with full trust.
All this is documented in the manual and there is no point in repeating it in a reddit post.
Also, please note that the GPG web of trust concept essentially confirms *identities**, that means that **signatures are intended to certifiy who owns which key, NOT how trustworthy they are**. Of course, if you already KNOW that a person has evil intentions, you shouldn't sign their key. But attackers are able to get signatures and become included in webs of trust, including the strong set, AND YOU HAVE TO WEIGHT that risk. It's a fact of life that you can't trust everyone. There is no way to exclude that in a purely technical way.
And moreover, you set a black-and-white schema where you consider signed keys from the GPG web of trust black = insecure while you consider your own key only confirmed in a reddit message as secure. Of course, a forum post can give additional information, but any forum can be hacked, and on reddit, passwords and cookies are not even transmitted via HTTPS. Specifically, Bitcointalk.it has been hacked two times already, and moreover, forum software is not intended to certify identities in a secure way. PGP signed keys *are* intended for that, as you do NOT rely on the security of a transport channel or a SSL certificate. Only, YOU have to weight this information, and make your decision based on it.

I think devices like Trezor are definitively a step in the right direction, but they are not sufficient. It does not help that your wallet is secure and protected by two-factor authentication if the information you relay on when spending coins, like the bitcoin address of the shop, or its domain name, or its SSL certificate, are forged by some banking malware in the computer which hosts the Trezor. 
Bitcoin can cope with an insecure network, but it **cannot** cope with compromised endpoint systems. And this is not the fault of Bitcoin - no electronic payment system or digital currency with Bitcoins qualities can cope with that. For example, if you have malware that replaces Paypal account names to which you are paying while you look them up in the Browser, you have the same problem. So, you need a secure browser. And a secure mail program. And so on.
And the other thing is, "secure computers" is something relative. You'll never get such as thing as absolute security. There will be always new exploits in networked systems. 
The point is it needs to be *secure enough* for average people to use. Like a car which must not present unnecessary dangers, and allows to travel with an acceptable risk level.
And most current systems do not meet that criterion when it comes to electronic banking. Ironically, to a large degree because they are supposed to be "easy to use" (which they are actually not when it comes to "easy to use in a secure way"). They are like pre-1950 cars built without any passive safety which will simply kill their passengers in a low-speed crash. Todays cars are safer *and* easier to use.

That's what I am thinking. At some point competiteive advantages in mining need to come from another source than expensive hardware. One thing I can imagine is cheap renewable energy sources. Maybe a mix from windpower and wavepower.
This kind of electricity is intermittent, but at a future point where the mining hardware is much less of a cost factor than the electricity, this does not matter very much.


I hope that. The long-term, and more serious problem which pushes centralization could be network connectivity, as Kaminsky pointed out.

Only of miners do not cooperate to a very tiny amount. The attitude that cooperation is bad might come from political views, but IMO  it is not supported by game theoretic views at the outcome.

The ironic thing is that Bitcoin kinda amplifies Windows' security problems. To manage any amount of Bitcoin larger than the price of a dinner, you need a pretty secure computer.

We will hear more about lost Bitcoins soon.

There is an interesting (and terrifying) report about the easiness of "social" hacks from a Wired journalist named Mat Honan, whose whole digital identity was stolen.

This is because personal computers have insufficient security.

I believe you did not get the point: Sure, you can control whether the payment address in Trezor matches the address that your online shopping cart displays in the browser, or what appears in the mail which the car dealer sent to you.
However, **you can NOT** be secure that this address is authentic information, because it was processed by your computer which is, in the "Mad General" scenario, compromised. A compromised computer simply means that about everything the computer does is ultimately under control of the attacker. He has not control over the Trezor device but over pretty much everything else - including over the information Trezor gets as input.
So, you would confirm with Trezor to send the price for the car to an address which can easily be owned by the attacker.
