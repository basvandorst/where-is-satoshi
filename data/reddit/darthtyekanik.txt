How legitimate is Iran anyway?
@_date: 2019-07-23 14:30:06
Are they being raped to death? Also since when are the black men suddenly a concern for anybody in this country, I thought the hot topic is the illegals.
@_date: 2019-07-23 11:06:08
no, the bully with the biggest number of women beaten to death with rocks apparently
@_date: 2019-07-21 17:51:03
finally, thanks
@_date: 2019-07-23 12:01:52
No, it's the bully with the biggest number of women beaten to death with rocks, period.

Right? It's more like a Ponzi scheme.
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:36:04
So now instead of bitcoin they will start trading promises of bitcoin.

TLDR. Could you rephrase it or post in a meme form?

You're bad for environment
@_date: 2017-12-25 02:26:32
No, wait till it goes below 10k and  then sell. Complete the cycle.
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:18:40
Because there's not a chance in the world that people learned their lesson in 9 years.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:12:31
Could it be because the fees are so high they exceed the amounts trasnferred??? Or are you going to cover up that too??? Sell alll noww!!!!

After little consideration I think you might be right. I'm off running to the nearby dogecoin atm machine to buy as much as I can! Oh wait...

Here's a source, but it's in Russian, as well as service's web-site:

No idea, I live in Russia. I wouldn't recommend going Eastern part of Ukraine though.
@_date: 2014-07-03 17:06:15
'cause it's multinational country?
@_date: 2014-01-02 11:03:35
Meh, qr codes are good enough
@_date: 2014-01-16 20:08:44
And 500USD monthly limit.

You don't spell them either, right? You just click a link.

It does, since qiwi is most convenient way to withdraw roubles from BTC-E.

Boohoo, I'm so rich I have hard time managing my money.
@_date: 2016-11-24 17:20:53
So I guess all those microtransactions prospects went down the drain.

That's a lot

Because capitalism
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:23:48
I know a guy who did exactly this. Apparently in Moscow they don't sell drugs by just hanging out on a corner - you go online pay with btc and they send you gps coordinates in a park somewhere. You go there for a night stroll and dig up your order.
@_date: 2015-07-14 02:04:01
He who(sells) spends what isn't his'n, must buy it back or go to prison.

They voted for this government, didn't they?
@_date: 2018-03-04 17:40:41
They can also print more magic plastic cards that only white people had back in the day. The cards you put into atm and it gives you free money.
@_date: 2017-09-17 23:59:37
I don't know what's worse.

@_date: 2013-08-21 08:46:50
Yeah, no answer to it here. Unless service includes "safe" that stores customer's side of the key, that opens for seller automatically after some time unless told otherwise. Like in regular banks.
@_date: 2013-04-20 19:20:54
Why the hell won't mtgox just implement cryptographic certificates for every client, like they do so on real trading grounds? They ask for ID, issue god damn certificate for Christ sake!
@_date: 2013-11-23 18:51:14
Everybody know what BTC is... Come on.

If there's anything I have learned from trading technical analysis, it's that you can easily create a "discovery mechanism", that 100% works on past data.

Will this upgrade also include other currencies implementation? LTC in particular?
@_date: 2013-06-23 18:05:06
Well, I'm currently building "large scale" rigs and I go with MSI 7970 Lightning BE. Just because I couldn't obtain regular Lightnings. But it's if the space is not an issue.
@_date: 2013-06-23 17:39:49
I'd go with MSI Lightning 7990 and Intel motherboard with watchdog timer. No idea about the rest.
@_date: 2013-07-29 13:02:21
What goods? 😁
@_date: 2013-12-07 21:00:50
Duuude... It was obvious. Keep t, don't sell. Wait for 6 months at least.
@_date: 2013-11-20 13:03:12
I didn't panic when they couldn't send me for a month my USD, after that I gave up, bought BTC and left them for good, why should I now?
@_date: 2013-07-01 07:50:59
Don't expect them to be top notch pros. It ain't bank or something. They're not regulated, they can hire complete full retard, who messes all up and still get away with it. Just saying.
@_date: 2013-04-13 07:06:47
Do they really exist? With all that butterfly scam and all?
@_date: 2013-08-21 07:55:14
Cute. However since you didn't generate it yourself, you can't be 100% sure...

@_date: 2013-04-17 20:09:42
Lucky for me I had trading experience in the past. I invested 600 dollars in this and lost about 400 over the year. It was 15 years ago and I have learned my lesson.
In fact bitcoins are great for this - there's no "leverage" and no taxes. You don't have to mess with greedy dealers and their glitchy software. 
If you can't stop yourself- go ahead, invest the amount you can afford to loose and be prepared to loose every cent. Constant frustration becomes boring over time - you see results of your wrong decisions over and over again. That should cool you down. If not - you've got a problem.
@_date: 2013-06-23 16:12:28
Good news, everyone!
@_date: 2013-12-04 21:13:48
About time... I was gonna ask when will it finally become a thing. I mean come on, it's USD1000 already... It should've happened one zero earlier.

Litecoins are faster. But you can make any transaction faster by including a transaction fee in a wallet.
