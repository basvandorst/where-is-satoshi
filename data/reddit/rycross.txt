Not likely.

Yes. Using Bitcoin for remittances just outsources the problem of converting the value you received into local currency. After getting your Bitcoin you still have to do work to convert it to something usable locally. Bitcoin solves the relatively easy part of this problem (in a less efficient manner)

How much of a problem is that in practice though?  People could choose to sacrifice some anonymity to merge utxo without requiring everyone to sacrifice anonymity. I don't think everyone needs or wants all of their transactions to have that level of anonymity.

Why can't you shard the UTXO database?  It's basically key-value lookup, correct?  That's pretty goddamn easy to shard.

Ulbricht's diary stating that he hired a hit is not evidence of attempted  murder?  What?

That is not entrapment.  Here's what does and does not constitute entrapment in [cartoon form](

My income taxes are deducted from my paycheck before it even hits my account.  In cases where it is not pre-collected, the government already knows how much tax to expect from you based on filings from the company. Bitcoin would not change this -- the thing that would is massive tax disobedience by employers, which is not likely to happen.


The government borrows money by issuing bonds.  These can exist in a Bitcoin world.

I think you meant the 16th amendment and the ability to collect income tax constitutionally.  Income tax collection happened as early as the civil war, which is the point that the IRS was formed (although the office collecting tax revenue wasn't called the IRS at this time).  Income tax collection was ruled unconstitutional and then made constitutional via amendment a couple decades later in 1913, at which point the already-existing IRS started collecting income tax again.  I don't think this substantively changes the gist of your speculation, but I wanted to take the opportunity to be a pedantic bastard (its my fetish, don't kink-shame).
Regarding the rest of your point, yes it'd probably limit the amount the government could borrow, although in terms of magnitude I think you're over-estimating.  At any rate, you seem to agree with me that governments could still borrow, and dispute the magnitude at which they could borrow.   The former is really the point I was trying to make.

Cloud miner = Instead of buying your own mining hardware and operating it, you pay someone else to do so instead, usually as a subscription service.  Think Amazon EC2 except for miners.  The problem is that you dont know if these cloud mining services actually own any hardware or are doing anything other than taking in money and paying out previous investments using current cash flow (i.e. a ponzi).
altcoins = Crytocurrency other than bitcoin, almost always based off bitcoin's codebase.  Litecoin, dogecoin, etc.
paycoin = Another altcoin made by Homero Garza

Buttcoin isn't as smart as the Daily Show but the gist is the same.  We're also far more immature.

So what you're saying is that BitGo is really terrible at patent trolling.

I actually doubt you would.
