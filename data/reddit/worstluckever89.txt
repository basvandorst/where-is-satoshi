I've always said price action is the best way to keep miners in check. As long as the majority of their revenue is derived from mining valuable coins and not transaction fees then they have every incentive to stabilize the politics and infighting.

I don't know anyone adopting Ethereum for commerce. Zilch. Give it up

I'd like to see more merchant services providing BTC payouts. For example if I run a business and use a credit card processor, I'd like my disbursements paid in BTC rather than bank transfer.
On the other end my wish would simply be for Amazon to adopt BTC. Buying an Amazon gift card with BTC is fairly stress free but it would be nice to skip that step.
I'd also like for Western Union to adopt it as well. I know that seems counterintuitive but fiat still has its uses. Let me send BTC to WU and let the recipient pick up cash wherever.

That worked until everyone figured out they could switch to alts and avoid this permanently. Time for Bitpay to become EtherPay.

I'd guess a 30% downside, 50% upside, initial reaction. Nothing more than a guess.

This is how the market punishes miners for doing stupid things. Price goes down.
