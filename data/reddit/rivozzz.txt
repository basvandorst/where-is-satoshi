Mike from poloniex (see below) says that it's okay to deposit as much as you want but not to withdraw!

And deposit as much as I want ?
@_date: 2017-03-04 19:40:54
So I can deposit more than 25k? Without having any freeze on my account?

What about large amount in exchange? I'm forced to. As BTC may drop soon, so I will sell all BTC .

I don't mind about withdrawing now. I want to trade. So depositing can be higher with no problems ?

The surprise is that it will show again to everybody that hard forks are absolutely fine (Bitcoin Cash showed that too, Ethereum/Monero and others show it regularly), and we've been lied and slowed down.

I like that there seem to be miners helping us reach these milestones faster... they seem to prioritize SegWit transactions over the normal ones. I'm not paying more than 12-13 satoshi per byte lately.
