Walt Lukken, a former CFTC commissioner and acting chairman who’s the  chief executive officer of the Futures Industry Association, called  Chilton “the David Lee Roth of the CFTC.”
Chilton,  whose signature look included lengthy hair and, often, cowboy boots,  was a critic of high-frequency trading, calling the firms “[cheetahs](  for their speed in markets. He cited some of the same risks Michael  Lewis laid out in his book “Flash Boys” -- namely that high-frequency  traders take advantage of other investors.
After leaving the CFTC he ended up [advising high-frequency traders]( while working for the Modern Markets Initiative, a lobbying group founded in 2013 by four HFT firms.
