@_date: 2014-05-08 17:16:33
uooh let it rain on me too ^^
@_date: 2014-05-27 14:46:06
get some coins over mycelium or localbitcoins...and dependent on how long you have time to pay get some facts about bitcoin at all _check google or here 
@_date: 2014-06-05 17:48:44
is there a youtube version available ? i cant watch videos on cnbc for what reason ever...ok could be some firefox plugin /adblockplus-requestpolicy-ghostery-noscript ...
@_date: 2014-10-13 14:37:06
... i´ve heard that you can buy them without showing a license/ID ?  over here you get an CC /even if its only prepaid only with ID !
@_date: 2014-06-30 20:53:00
uoh.... i saw what it was in the text...and actually it was a pleasure that it doesnt went further :)  but normally proxmate plays everything...thats the point
@_date: 2014-06-01 15:10:45

@_date: 2014-05-25 20:01:52
its only YOUR coins if its in your pocket...means on your harddrive or paperwallet xD
@_date: 2014-07-06 20:01:24
perhaps on another smartphone with a script who only downloads free apps and get coins while laying on the desk with charger plugged in :)   no joking ! - but really ...wouldnt install this on my daily driver ! 
@_date: 2014-07-08 02:15:08

@_date: 2014-10-13 14:28:25
here you go ^^
    
...but i guess they only accept that challenge if you have an account with them xD
@_date: 2014-05-26 18:00:27
always take your coins off the internet -at least put in on your harddrive with a nice backup or 2...and if you want to be sure make an offline paper wallet :)
@_date: 2014-05-21 13:21:06
yeah this is actually good news xD ...will vote on sunday for pirate party in eu parliament and our city council too...hope they get some decent  %
@_date: 2014-11-27 11:30:48

@_date: 2014-07-09 03:03:17
dunno how to make new seed...but i would create simply a new wallet and send the coins to it ?!
@_date: 2014-06-30 20:30:06

waiting for "the" news... and then excessive chartPr0n watching...beeing live on-stage when bitcoin is going a bit closer to the moon :)
@_date: 2014-07-05 14:43:55
i cant see the website in my firefox(adblock-ghostery-requestpolicy-noscript)...and even in chrome doesnt work---whitelisting on all plugins doesnt work too
@_date: 2014-05-25 17:36:36
mycelium + bitcoin wallet...would like to have a simple electrum app from playstore :)
@_date: 2014-06-17 13:49:20

@_date: 2014-10-31 17:43:51

@_date: 2014-11-19 11:30:35
i guess it means: " *he(bitcoin) shall make independent from banks*- very remarkeble sentence! " but actually the private keys for this old technique are laying around the interweb all the time :)
@_date: 2014-11-06 04:12:36
would like to see facebook changetip´s soon...this could boost quit a bit more !!1
@_date: 2014-07-02 11:44:49
how do you think so ?
@_date: 2014-06-02 13:47:54
indeed...better buy with localbitcoins or mycelium ...this sounds 100% like a rip off :)
@_date: 2014-05-05 06:24:17
what about formula e ? the new electric race series ?
would be nice to have a little B logo on a racer...or perhaps a complete new bitcoin car for the next season :)
@_date: 2014-10-10 13:49:50

@_date: 2014-10-13 13:20:12
  here the originals...they are my first trial&amp;errors with my selfbuilt CNC :)
@_date: 2014-05-21 14:39:16
perhaps you better put your money directly in btc...
 i own one 24 gh/s asic but it stands still at the moment - price for power is too much...  but when i have my solar panels,mppt and batterys ready i will single mine without pool only for good luck and supporting the network :)
@_date: 2014-10-13 16:24:39
yep design was not approved ...sry for misunderstandings...english is not my natural language xD
@_date: 2014-07-03 10:27:44
thats cool...when i go from Swiss home again towards Germany in 1 1/2 months i will visit them for sure !!1
are there some bitcoiners here from near Bern/Kandersteg ?
@_date: 2014-05-26 20:12:12
people get the news and their brains have to evaluate whats going on...this take some time ^^
not to mention that many people would like to buy(like me) but havent the spare money laying around and so have to wait for there fiat to convert in cryptos-in my case on about the 1 of june
@_date: 2014-05-21 13:16:39
i will vote for the pirate party too,but here in germany elections are this sunday...not tomorrow ?!  :)
@_date: 2014-05-29 18:17:13
would be my first tip too :)
@_date: 2014-07-08 02:06:35
hey redditors
i had just an idea...
anyone here who want some finest Schnaps from Germany ?
riped 15 years in the big glas bubble in our cellar within perfekt temperature... 
in parts of west Germany its allowed for land owners to earn their fruits and 
let them make schnaps from it in a local destillery (brennerei).
1999 my Dad (rip) collectet the fruits on our land,made the mash and let burn this clear and absolutely delicious,best quality Schnaps in a Brennerei 1 KM from here.since then its riped well in this glasbottle the last 15 years and want to get drunk now i think ^^
dunno yet exactly what fruit it was but it could 
only be cherry or plum and Alcohol is more than 42vol% -but i have to measure/check !
so_anyone over here who wants to buy a bottle ? no paypal accepted- bitcoin only ^^ 
i could make about ~20 bottles of 0,5 liter or ~40 bottles of 0.25 Liter-perhaps
 arranged in a wooden present box - depends on how much people want some...
(when i buy at least 50 empty glassbottles i could have a unique 
colored print on every bottle,burned into the glass !) 
so please tell me if its a good idea or should i sell it the normal way in my neighborhood 
and to friends in boring fiat currency ?!?
@_date: 2014-06-30 19:45:43

@_date: 2014-06-02 17:45:40
if i would buy gold then for sure not on the site from this guy :)  and not for bitcoins...perhaps for a little diversity in € ...ok :)  
@_date: 2015-01-26 05:45:41
i think bitstamp was hacked for some coins and closed their site shortly to fix their problems...
@_date: 2015-01-13 15:59:38
im not quite sure if i want to install some closed source app only for paying with bitcoins...
or is it open source ?
@_date: 2015-01-19 23:39:44

@_date: 2015-05-20 12:07:10
 my account is pretty bankrupt but here you have 1$ ...ive been searching such an app since a few weeks :)
i try to put some nfc tags in my diy wood wristwatches &amp; stuff that i am developing now...
but how save is it to let your coins on an nfc tag ? 
you wouldnt want to make cold sorage out of them, do you ??
so its cool to have a few coins on the nfc-tag itself but is there a plan to build in a 2fa feature for the tags ?
e.g. i would like to have the nfc tag in my watch as 2fa for sending coins from my smartphone ...  so that i swing my phone over my wristwatch to auth the payment
@_date: 2015-01-26 03:40:07
one part of me is like: gogogo - to the moon !  but the other part is a little bit said because no possibillities to buy some more btc bevore it takes off :)
@_date: 2015-05-09 17:33:26
ive bought some bitcoins finally with the Xapo debitcard !
here i posted some infos- about an hour ago -but unfortunatly this post is no more traceable yet-only the permalink... for whatever reason ?!
  
@_date: 2015-05-09 16:26:32
i finally managed to purchase some bitcoins with my new Xapo debit card !
wire transferd 100 € on  thursday the o5.07.2015 and today,as i looked into my account,its already here :)
German account with Kreissparkasse and the €´s are going to Raiffeisen Bank Slovenia.
im quite impressed of that short time between transfer and bitcoin in my wallet + it seems,its a reasonable price too ?!
Xapo fee 1€-
processing fee 0,12€-
0.46397034 btc in my vault
next test will be:  try to buy something online with the debitcard(visa) ...
 a friend of mine want to have some sneakers and later today i will buy them for her xD
in test  i´ll try to buy some food or drink in a local store with the card
@_date: 2014-06-02 17:34:01

@_date: 2018-03-05 04:24:56

@_date: 2015-11-19 02:47:39

...perhaps a personal thing between AxelSpringer-verlag &amp; Guttenberg,since he was a trainee there, years bevore he fckd up too hard with his doctor title ;-)  lol
but jokes beside i think its this common thing of innovation phobia over here in germany/europe,paired with conservative bueraucrats/banking shills who have fear of loosing their benefice in the comtemporary system ^^
