Here's my 2 cents:
Have an end goal in mind. If you arbitrarily throw money into an investment you will get emotional when the price fluctuates. What do you plan to do with this money if it grows? If you don't have an answer then you will act on emotion. However, if you know you're aiming for 2x return in order to buy y, you can just hold and wait until you reach your goal.
Another question: are you prepared for emergencies? Auto repairs, medical bills, etc? If not, you are going to pull your bitcoin out and you have a good chance of doing so at a loss. Don't put yourself in that position. The people who win are the ones who are patient enough to leave it in for years if need be.

1. I disagree with this one. Having an organization lobby on behalf of Bitcoin sounds too much like centralization to me.
2. Ever heard of a satoshi?
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:26:45
As a neutral 3rd party, what is so great about Bitfinex? Why would somebody be butthurt because they need to use a different exchange? I lost a lot of money a few years ago when I didn't listen to what people were saying about Cryptsy. I won't be surprised if Bitfinex follows suit. I'm not saying I know whether they're legit or not, they could be. I just don't care.
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:17:45
I guess I just misunderstood then, because I completely agree with this. As annoying as the hodl echo chamber can be, it is the right thing for people to be screaming.

@_date: 2018-01-24 13:52:27
I have had the same thought, and it's what makes me want to think twice about holding. On the other hand, I think that as long as Bitcoin proves to be secure, especially through the adoption of LN, it becomes difficult for other cryptocurrencies to "compete" with the things that make Bitcoin valuable. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 14:16:20
How is that not anonymous? People don't know who owns the private key. The only way the blockchain works is if we can see what bitcoin goes where.

I'm getting tired of reading about how the lightning network introduces centralization. If anybody can build a node, how is that centralized? Also, does anybody making that claim understand onion routing? It's like trying to call Tor centralized.

It doesn't only apply to Bitcoin, and you are correct.
@_date: 2018-01-23 14:24:43
The only thing keeping most altcoins alive is idiots and speculation, so they'll probably stick around for awhile.
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:46:27


All of them actually.
@_date: 2018-01-23 15:59:02
It depends on several factors, such as the efficiency of your power supply, the clock speed you use to mine, etc. Best is to use a power monitor, check your crypto gains after a few days, and then compare your power cost with your gains. From a former miner, it's really not that profitable. Save your money and just buy more coin.
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:47:12
No, their Bitcoin would be turned over to authorities without a doubt. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 19:42:29
I'm actually really disappointed in Richard Heart's recent tweets. I get being bearish, but he's producing counter-arguments to things he has said in the past. I think he has some great thoughts regarding cryptocurrency and Bitcoin, but all the FUD he's spouting makes me think he's shorting Bitcoin or trying to get more on the cheap.
@_date: 2018-01-31 12:46:41
Or it's not what they are doing. How can you know? Nobody knows yet.
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:19:34
I have been in the crypto economy since the very early days. This was back in 2011 and since then I got to know the ups and downs of the market. I have seen the market crash from over $10 to almost zero, from $100 to under $10 and so on. On Monday morning, as I have always done for the last 6+ years, I was shocked after checking the Bitcoin price. The first thing that came to mind was: This is the end.
It took me a few hours to remind myself that I have been through this more times than I can remember or possibly count. The MtGox closure, “Bitcoin got hacked”, China banning Bitcoin mining, JP Morgan CEO calling Bitcoin “a fraud”, Bitcoin is only for money laundering and many more.
What scares me this time is that there are other players in the game now. In the early days, when the word hodl was more or less born, I had contact with most of the major players and actors in the space and there was always one thing that we all agreed on: We want to change the world. So we fastened our seatbelts and went on the fun and thrilling crypto ride together.
It is the end of an era for me. I say this because, for many in the crypto space, bitcoin and other cryptos are no longer about changing the world – it became a way to make more (and fast) money. That is one of the reasons why people tend to panic and sell – People are afraid of losing money.
In my humble opinion, this is not how bitcoin should be treated. Bitcoin is the biggest experiment in the world so far and it has the potential to change the world as we know it forever. It is not, nor was it designed to be, a tool to get rich quickly.
Now, you shouldn’t think that this is the end of crypto as it is definitely not. It is the beginning of a new era. Companies like Telegram announce ICOs to create their version of crypto and money. Line will get into crypto and Mark Zuckerberg promised to take a look into crypto this year too. Not to mention that gold is also still there despite banks all over the world printing paper money. And guess what? Gold will still be there when paper money is gone. It is the same old story, all over again. We need something independent, a store of value that is not controlled by one of those big companies. A decentralized one.
If you think about it, cryptocurrency is the most logical thing in this capitalist world since it is openly based on the free market. Just a few years ago, banks were the most powerful institutions but that is coming to an end. Companies like Apple, Google, Facebook now have way more power than most banks.
For me, it is a logical step that these companies want to be able to print their own money and crypto is their gateway to win this game. I think that next year will probably be the biggest year for crypto that we have ever seen. Companies that had nothing to do with it will start diving into it and start projects dedicated to crypto.
The current downward trend is just a short-term thing before the big guys step on stage. All crypto guys are sitting in the front row to enjoy the show. I personally think it would be a shame to leave a show before it has actually started. Therefore, I urge all crypto enthusiasts to stay put. Stay in your seats, so that when the real show begins, you are able to enjoy the magnificent view from the front row.
Don’t panic, and as many, many times before: HODL on! We will reach the moon together and enjoy a fantastic show and we will always be able to say: We started this revolution.
Sincerely yours,
Jörg from Bitwala
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:48:09
Maybe, but we're talking a different event entirely and we still don't really know what the deal is.
@_date: 2018-01-29 19:59:18
OK, so:
1. You should do this yourself and stop being lazy and asking somebody else to do it for you. Your brother clearly did his research, now do yours.
2. I agree with most of his points. Alts are 99% garbage. You should hate crypto too.
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:49:10
Or just maybe it will be like TCP/IP, which is still used heavily and has new layers added to it. Lightning network anyone?
@_date: 2018-01-09 22:11:05
I'm expecting a large drop in ALTs, and I think BTC will suffer as a result, but it will recover when Wall Street can figure out how to get ETFs approved. Who knows how long that will be, and shorter term BTC will probably rebound anyway if it's undervalued as much as many of us think it is. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 17:48:47
Thanks for humoring me here. It's easy to get jaded in this sub, and I  wrongly assumed your position was one that I loathe. When I go back and look, it is kind of egregious how they have this huge picture of the guy with a giant headline. Most people will form an opinion on that alone, so you're not wrong. Idiots cause the price fluctuations that I make money on so at least that is good.
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:12:13
I care about it as a currency like I care about gold as a currency.
@_date: 2018-01-31 19:32:44
This is just straight up false. I truly believe in Bitcoin as a store of value today, and as a spending medium in the future. I care about Bitcoin as a technology AND I am hodling. Deal with it.
@_date: 2018-01-31 14:14:13
Well founded points. Here are my thoughts.
I think the answer to 1 is all of us. We're here (presumably) because we believe in this technology, and in Bitcoin specifically, so it's up to us to educate our peers. Everytime I hear somebody say Bitcoin is a scam, or Bitcoin was hacked, or anything like that, I do my best to respond with good information. Just the same, I think people will figure it out as the price continues to go up through the years.
I truly don't think 2 matters. People have been buying fractions of stocks long before Bitcoin came to be. If I want to exchange $1 for Bitcoin I can do it. Besides, we're only talking about average Joes in this example. Before they're using Bitcoin there will need to be better infrastructure in place (LN, segwit fully adopted, etc.).
@_date: 2018-01-30 17:28:43
What do you mean "community nodes?" 
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:49:13
Dichotomy would have served better.
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:34:31
It is lame. The one that caught my eye was when he said "People mad cuz I'm bearish. I didn't even mention Satoshi could spend his million coins at any moment lol." I also seem to remember him stating that it's hard to imagine that they would sit dormant for that long if they weren't lost forever. It's like he's either just trolling or shorting/buying low. Just the same, I bought and I'm not selling anytime soon.
@_date: 2018-01-26 16:35:28
The way I look at it is you did nothing stupid until you sell at a loss. Unless Bitcoin never goes above 14k for the rest of its history you didn't necessarily make a bad move. Now, if you need that money or couldn't afford to lose it, yeah, it was a bad move. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 22:12:33
You're playing the game wrong. Put your emotions aside and hold, stop paying transaction fees because of FUD. The price has been hugging 15k and it could go either way.
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:53:02
It's not foolish if you don't know what the price will do and you plan to hold, and if you think the price will go up above 20k at some point in the future. That's what investing is about.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:25:12
For all intensive purposes we should all expect the price direction of Bitcoin to take a 360 degree turn.
@_date: 2018-01-30 17:31:09
TL;DR: The entire article is bullshit.
@_date: 2018-01-26 15:55:08
First of all, change your annoying run-on sentences into well thought out questions. You sound like an irritated 10 year-old.
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:46:11
This is what I thought too until now. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:54:20


I hate this sentiment. Why is it too bad? Will Bitcoin never reach that price again? Now if you said too bad for those who sold I would agree.
@_date: 2018-01-23 00:49:56
I mean, I just googled it. MSFT went from about 17 to 90 today, so 10 years timeframe makes you wrong by a Longshot. I didn't check the other two because I knew you were full of it after the first one.
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:58:51
I agree mostly, but I get tired of the "stop using Bitcoin to try to get rich" thing. Why not? I like the idea of Bitcoin, and I like the idea that investing in good tech can make a person rich. Some people don't want to understand or care about the tech, but why should I care if they want to buy or sell? What's wrong with Bitcoin being gold 2.0? As far as I'm concerned Bitcoin can get attention for any reason, and that is fine with me. I have made money thanks to the volatility, and I will continue to do so as long as I can.
@_date: 2018-01-30 17:50:55
Nothing but a useless comparison.
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:26:52
You have no idea what you're talking about.

If you think they can't seize those kind of assets you are truly ignorant.
@_date: 2018-01-31 14:18:21
Well yeah, following one of the biggest monthly increases we have seen.
@_date: 2018-01-24 15:28:34
Did you read the article? He makes some well founded points. Who cares if he's Steve Wozniak or Taylor Swift? If they're good points based on good logic then it's worth hearing. If anything his name helps me form my own opinion based on his points, because I know of his past and his credentials. By your own logic I should completely disregard anything you have to say, because I know nothing of your knowledge base, expertise in any given area or lack thereof.


Exactly, so take his word for what it's worth to you. That's what everybody else will do too. No reason to go on acting like it's foolish to listen to the opinion of the guy.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:15:49
I wasn't going to respond, but I have to because this is the stupidest damn thing I've ever heard. MLMs are almost literally the opposite of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-24 16:24:36
Yeah, so when I read back through it all I think I overlooked our agreements. My original reply had more to do with legitimizing a position based on a name, and I was just trying to say that we can all google who he is and form our own opinion. I just get tired of this whole "whales conspiring" bs that gets spouted all the time, and the way people read so far into things. I'm just saying that we truly should take this at face value, why try to state that there is anything else going on?
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:09:39
Do you have any actual analysis, or do you just go around saying "lol" and "sell" to everybody offering an opinion? I'm guessing the latter.
@_date: 2018-01-26 15:57:33
Oh great, another BCash.
@_date: 2018-01-23 03:30:10
Ah, right...I'm the idiot here. I was reading as greater than instead of less than. Time for bed.
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:52:04
What do you mean eventually? Lightning network is here and it already has 100 nodes with 100% successful testing on mainnet. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:47:39


I keep seeing this and I think it's poor sentiment. The comparison is made because 2014 was following a huge price increase, but that was when Gox happened. We don't have a Gox today. No, Tether is not Gox. Bitconnect is not Gox. I don't think there is a good reason to expect the same thing to occur.

@_date: 2018-01-17 14:05:57
Yeah, it's funny how much we hear about how volatile cryptocurrency and bitcoin is, and yet people still freak out and claim the sky is falling when they get in the game and the price drops. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 17:46:03


No, the old Nokia vs. new smartphone was a gross generalization and entirely misleading comparison. That was why I responded the way I did, because if we're going to make stupid comparisons at least TCP/IP makes more sense. I wouldn't say all altcoins are garbage; coins like byteblock that uses an acyclic graph is a good way of looking at TCP vs UDP. They are both useful ideas independently, and they don't lower the value of the other. 
The part that you and I are both missing with these analogies is the store of value and scarcity, not to mention first mover advantage provided by Bitcoin. Since tcp/ip is not a currency it can't apply to that example. That's why building on Bitcoin's blockchain is more beneficial than inventing a shitcoin and building on top of that. The only way cryptocurrency can be worthwhile is if one is adopted, we can't just go on adopting the next best digital currency that comes into existence or it ruins the whole thing.
@_date: 2018-01-10 21:33:13

Personally, I like to applaud anybody who wants to buy Bitcoin for any reason. Speculative traders or not, people buying Bitcoin is a good thing. The speculation is what causes the massive fluctuations, which is fine because I can keep some cash reserve and buy enough to profit. Don't hate the player.
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:59:02
Bitcoin playing 4d chess while the rest of us use only 2 dimensions SMH.
@_date: 2018-01-24 13:57:17
Yes exactly this. Because if I'm an expert in one area I can't possibly know a single thing about anything else.
@_date: 2018-01-10 12:27:41
Yeah maybe. I personally think it's still undervalued by a large margin for a few reasons, primarily because it currently is the equivalent of gold in digital form (or the closest thing we have to it). The market is ruled by speculation so the real value just can't be realized.
@_date: 2018-01-31 21:57:42
Ha, so when they're investigating they're just going to say "Oh, I see you exchanged tether for Bitcoin here, but since it's Bitcoin I guess there's nothing we can do. Oh well."
@_date: 2018-01-24 13:54:57
I think this is a poor argument. Of course wealthy and famous people invest, and of course they will talk about it. Why do these endorsements have to be "abusing their position?" Everybody has some influence. If I tell my less wealthy friends I have Bitcoin holdings am I abusing my position? These people are not pointing a gun at our heads. People can choose ~~weather~~ whether or not to listen to them. What you're saying is victim mentality at its finest.
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:39:16


This is my point lol. There isn't that much I can buy with Bitcoin right now. I'm holding because I believe in its future, and if it does become a viable currency the value will go up significantly. In the meantime at least it is useful for its scarcity, decentralization and security.
@_date: 2018-01-24 00:31:23
Not the cost of hardware, just the cost of power mostly. Also, I wouldn't even bother with the CPU. You don't have to take my word for it, but buy a kill-a-watt meter and do the math yourself. Probably not worth it.
@_date: 2018-05-03 16:39:05
It also helps that ETH and Bitcoin are so very different from each other, as opposed to BCash which just ~~stole~~ copied the source code and logo from Bitcoin.
Edit: there, ya happy fools?
@_date: 2018-05-04 13:32:29
Let's get to the heart of my point. Copying code for the purpose of forking is fine. Copying the code, stealing the logo and the name, and trying to mislead millions of people is what's fucked up and we all know it.

Honestly, there is a human side to this that needs to be addressed. First of all, don't burn bridges over this matter with your mom. Show her that you respect her point of view, and ask her if she would be willing to discuss it further. If you can get that far then you might have a chance. Then you can tell her why you think it's a good place to put your money, and explain that you're thinking about your future. You could just go out and buy a video game, but you've decided this is what you want to do, so try to explain this. Also, I recommend Gemini over Coinbase if you're going to use a large exchange. If you research the differences I think you'll come to the same conclusion. Good luck!
@_date: 2018-03-13 18:43:53
tl;dr use Gemini

I'm not trying to slam your efforts my friend. You do give clear and concise information, but it is not palatable at all. Watch yourself, do you act that way when you speak to people in person? You are just putting on such a front that you don't seem like the kind of person I would want to learn from. Its your gig though man, if you're happy with it then what I say shouldn't matter. 
I do have a passion I create content around actually. I know as well as you do that it is a cruel world out there. I wish I could get the same balanced feedback like I gave you.

I think this is the real line in the Sand. On one hand Bitcoin really isn't rocket science, and it can be easily copied and improved upon. On the other hand the fact that it has layer 2 possibilities and is harder to corrupt than an ico makes me think it will stabilize and gain viability. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 18:58:01


I think this is short sighted. It goes up in value if the demand goes up, but the demand won't go up infinitely. At some point Bitcoin will need to be better at being an actual currency.
@_date: 2018-03-15 17:34:05
This is misleading. Many single large addresses belong to exchanges. They represent many individuals. Satoshi’s coins are also included in this figure.
@_date: 2018-02-22 13:50:05
I think you're right, and this is also why I'm a Bitcoin maximalist. I know it has good devs with a lot of experience. Even some of the more popular alts right now (i.e. IOTA) are pieces of crap.

This sub in a nutshell.
@_date: 2018-02-14 17:56:07
This is a poor reply. The code on Github literally says "do not use on mainnet." Whenever they offically release the LN project and say it is safe to use, it will be safe to use. That is the right answer.

Let's start with the definition of money:


Bitcoin has a price relative to other forms of money. I can exchange Bitcoin for USD and vice-versa. I can also use Bitcoin to buy things. What more convincing do you need?

“My small savings that I do have are invested in bitcoin. 100 percent [of it]. I actually have a tiny debt in US dollars that I’m still trying to pay off so it is more than 100 percent in bitcoin. Now, I’d like to emphasize again, that is not a recommendation to invest. Because I haven’t invested by money in bitcoin, I invested my career, my intellectual capacity, my creativity energy, my passion, and my work in bitcoin. The money is the least of the investment that I have made in bitcoin and I could lose everything of it and I’d still have everything else.” -Andreas Antinopoulos

This is such a stupid argument that people always make. "Of course &lt;insert name here&gt; says the price will skyrocket because they own a bunch of it." Yes, they own a bunch of it because they think the price will skyrocket. At least they're putting their money where their mouth is. What kind of person would say "I think the price is going to skyrocket, but I don't own any of it."

There are not words to describe just how stupid, conflated, and downright ignorant this response is.


This is wrong almost everywhere you look. Take this excerpt from the Mises Institute, for starters:
"Money is not useful in itself, but because it has an exchange value, it is exchangeable in terms of other goods and services. Money is demanded because the benefit it offers is its purchasing power, i.e., its price."
Does Bitcoin have purchasing power? Yes. Can I exchange Bitcoin for goods or services? Yes. Does it have a price? Yes.
Oh, this next part is good. A straight up contradiction on your part. I'll just quote them both.




How about a source for this next comment?


You're also wrong about this:


Actually it can. You can pay taxes in Bitcoin if you live in Arizona.


So what is the blockchain then?

If anybody in the world knew the right time to buy they would literally not need a job. Nobody knows. We just do the best we can. The best thing is just to buy continuously. I bought at 15, then again at 13, 10, 9, 8, and 7. I have basically broken even at this point. If it goes back to 15 I'll be profitable.

Either I'm an idiot or not a single one of those exchanges has Bitcoin. The only one that says it does has no whitepaper or URL.
Edit: Alright, so I found the counterparty site using Google and I looked for how to buy Bitcoin using it. I clicked the "Get Started" link and then "find places to get Bitcoin near you." That took me here:

Basically Roger Ver copied the source code of Bitcoin, created Bcash, hired shitty developers to make it "better," then started shit talking Bitcoin which he stole the source code from to begin with. He also copied Bitcoins name and logo, and calls Bcash "the new Bitcoin." He has all his holdings in Bcash now, so it benefits him to talk up his shitcoin and he has somehow made a bunch of people believe he is the new Bitcoin saviour.

In 2008 we experienced the housing crash because banks were lending more money than they should, and it caught up with them. People using credit cards to buy cryptocurrency could yield similar results if people lose all their money in a dip and can't pay the banks back. I would probably make the same move if I were a bank.

The article doesn't read positive at all. Did YOU even read it? It basically says "this is all the stuff wrong with Bitcoin, but some people still believe in it." This writer ignores the fact that while core devs ignore changes proposed by certain people, they are implementing their own ideas to fix them (i.e. Layer 2). He also says ETH will overcome Bitcoin. That just screams ignorance to me. ETH and Bitcoin are VERY different from one another.
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:03:55


It's not a scheme at all. It's literally software that is open for anybody to use. The way people use it, and the way they buy and sell, is up to them. Some nerds who started mining in the early days who got full blocks aren't whales, they're early adopters who are being rewarded for being forward thinking.


This is a gross generalization. I can promote Bitcoin until my face is blue and the price will not be affected. However, I like the idea of it, and I like to talk about it with people who agree that a decentralized and secure platform is good at its core. If it is a good thing then the price will go up. This idea that everybody here is just throwing money into Bitcoin and waiting for it to moon is asinine. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 13:41:23
It's not a bad article. It makes some good points, and the price could go that low. Just because it's unpleasant doesn't mean we should ignore it. It doesn't mean we can't still believe in the longer-term rise.

Since you look like the creator of the video I'll just give you my opinion (if you're not the creator you can disregard). You really remind me of one of those MLM personalities who drives up in a corvette and tells me I can retire at the age of 30. Even if you have good intentions, I find myself highly skeptical of what you're saying. Watch yourself and ask if you could listen to, say, a college professor speak that same way for an hour?
It's clear to me that your target audience is young and ignorant, and maybe this appeals to them. If it does, and you reach them, then good on you man. I'm all for spreading good information.

Richard, since I know you might "drive by" and read this, I just want to say something. I just heard you for the first time a few weeks ago. At the time I was ready to throw a ton of money (for me) at altcoins, and you changed my mind. I'm mostly all in on Bitcoin now, and it's because of the excellent technical commentary on your part. I became a "fan" of yours. Well, all of that bearish talk about selling caught many of us off-guard because you formerly offered such great reasons to hold long term. Many of us are not day traders, we're people longing it because of many reasons you have championed. Thanks for all the great advice, but consider that a bunch of bearish to bullish tweeting is confusing and disappoints those of us who respect your intellect. My 2 cents would be to be the guy in this video, not the guy on Twitter recently. You seemed to think "we" only love you when you're bullish, but the truth is that most of us probably just really appreciate your good thoughts and opinions about the tech. In any case, I'll look forward to more of the good content you will hopefully be giving us in the future.

If anybody could prove you wrong we would all go shorting Bitcoin together right now. If anybody could prove the bulls right we would all be taking out second mortgages to buy. Saying "Please prove me wrong" makes your position look stronger than it is, because nobody can prove you wrong.

It's just a bunch of straw-man arguments based on things some idiots have probably said. Presenting weak arguments against strong ones makes the strong arguments look worse. For instance, Bitcoin DOES eliminate the need for 3rd parties, there is nothing foolish about thinking that. However, stacked up against the actual poor arguments he is making fun of makes it look like anybody is an idiot for believing in this stuff.
Since we're using straw man arguments, I'll rebut this video the same way. "Hey look at me, I can make a quick youtube video and use a condescending tone regarding Bitcoin the whole time, and that should make you feel like an idiot for every having bought it. My witty claims will make so many people think twice about Bitcoin, just like my idol JP Sears who I copied when I made this video

There is this saying that your income is your greatest wealth building tool. The less debt you have, the more income you have to work with.

I have this to say:
He spouts that today's hearing on shitcoin scams is bad for Bitcoin. It's quite the opposite IMO. People are going to see all these shitcoins for what they really are, and all the while Bitcoin will still hold strong and pump again at some point. Bitcoin is the non-scammiest thing we have right now. Buggy Ethereum, shitty ICOs, shitty forks, and now all of the gold diggers holding the bags from Decembers meteoric shitcoin rise is good for Bitcoin. If today is the first day of putting a stop to scammy ICOs then we can all rejoice.
@_date: 2018-02-07 19:53:04
It's hard for most of our ingrained "bullshit detectors" to not go off when we think about the price going up that high, but we would have thought the same thing when Bitcoin was $100 if somebody said it would get to 10k.
