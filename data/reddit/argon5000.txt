Every single time I've bought in, I've considered waiting for a dip. But then I just bought in anyway. I've never regretted it at the times I did. Just jump in now and hold on. I doubt you'll worry about it once things start to really take off.

Cashflow. If you have the cash available now go for it. But most people have to manage their cashflow and setting up periodic payments smoothes things out.

I’m seeing it as a post Black Friday surge. Cash available for bargains pre Thanksgiving... now free to invest if you didn’t spend.
