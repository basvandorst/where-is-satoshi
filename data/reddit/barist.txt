I can help you out. PM me

Bingo. I'm a 20 year old community college student that lives on his own. I go to school and work full time. I've just been looking for extra ways to make a little extra cash so I can have a social life. 
Edit: I have barely enough money for rent this month. Aside from that, zilch.

836,000 thousand dollars. Take a look. I fixed the link. 
@_date: 2013-10-31 05:07:20
I never had nearly that much to begin with.

Not a browser thing. It is coinbase for sure. It was doing the same thing for me. 
@_date: 2013-10-31 23:57:45
It really sucks. This is going to prevent people from investing in bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-10-31 05:48:35
I hope so. The buying/selling of bitcoins is what I think set some sort of alarm off. My second theory is mercury retrograde. Aside from the I lost my iphone on Saturday. Just got a new one, and just cracked the screen horribly on my brand new one. Just having an awful week.

Yes if you are more interested. Look up any third world org. Or donate here. This btc account get deposits biweekly to a small village in Southern Africa through a host. Thanks for taking part in this post. It's just the start of something bigger. 
Qumbutai village. South Africa. One of the few that I try to help by sending resources. I am trying to be as proactive with Btc as I can. This way the possibilities can be shown as to what this currency can do. .0001 can help!

If you could give some constructive criticism instead of thinking with a hive mentality, that would be just great.  
@_date: 2013-10-31 05:08:39
Well I'm not under any stress or anything so I had plenty of mental capacity to think about the technicalities. My apologies.
@_date: 2013-10-24 06:17:10
Funny thing is I did the same thing today. I was on the phone with them because they were holding about $100 of mine as "pending".  It was for selling bitcoin on eBay. I told the lady on the phone that this is the last time I was using their service, and "you're service sucks". This is literally what I said. What makes it funnier is after I said that she paused and I heard her typing on her computer.

What happened to all the comments on this thread?
@_date: 2013-10-31 05:10:38
Also , the bank debited my account for that much. Right now you know as much as I do. I've been trying to get answers for almost 4 days now.
@_date: 2013-10-12 05:41:50
They will no longer be servicing bitcoin customers after October 27th (or 26th).
@_date: 2013-10-04 01:06:09
Also, I have no connection with SR. I don't do drugs. And I am a law abiding citizen. 
@_date: 2013-10-31 19:35:41
I reposted for freshness. I put this out pretty late last night. I think that it will get more coverage today. Thanks for the info. I would have thought BoA or BA would have been the ticker symbol.
@_date: 2013-10-12 08:52:31
Wow! Thank you. Much appreciated . I donate what I can. (Don't make an extravagant amount of money) This really helps me out.
@_date: 2013-10-31 07:56:04
Do not due internal bank transfers. I think that's how I got got.
@_date: 2013-10-31 07:59:07
Do not due internal bank transfers. I think that's how I got got. Also, I really doubt any of the people's accounts got "hacked".  They could say they did and it would be hard to prove otherwise. Too many scumbags on this planet. Another thing, I would only deal with people that have had their account for a decent amount of time alongside a lot of positive feedback. I had one guy randomly text me demanding that I make a venom account so he could send me over a thousand dollars/10 btc. You just gotta use your brain a little. I think that I just got too hyped up with all the transactions I was doing. Now I'm screwed.
@_date: 2013-10-04 01:05:26
How can you compare this to a rapist? That doesn't make sense. You are saying that it is okay for him to be charged for the activities committed by the users of SR? Aside from the homicides, where there is not any proof of anyone actually dying. Read the reports. Look at the information. You see one article then make up your mind? Basically what you're saying is a mother gives birth to a kid, the kid kills someone, so she is responsible for his actions? That's what you are saying.  The government kills innocent people every day to protect their own interests. Is that okay? You need to take many more factors into account before you can come to a conclusion.

I'm also looking at the market in london. It's about equal to the same here. What method are you using to buy them?
@_date: 2013-10-19 09:51:27
 I'm currently dealing with someone  saying their account got hacked and the "hacker" bought bitcoins from me. Paypal has frozen my funds, and I think I'm going to lose my money. I even have pictures of the transactions and messages from the buyer giving me their wallet info.  You can get your money back for sure. Paypal does not allow the sell of virtual currency. Paypal is in favor of the buyer "one spending the money", as opposed to the one " receiving the money". You'll be fine. I'm out 20$ though :/

Here's the email I sent Dwolla. Help me by sending emails on how ceasing their Bitcoin services will affect others.
 
Edit: One too many periods. Also, the major problem that has been brought to light is the fact that many companies will follow Dwolla and cease to service Bitcoin users. They can try to stop us, but crypto will prevail!
@_date: 2013-10-31 03:13:44
Thanks for the advice. BofA customer service is among the worst. They'll suck the life out of you. I didn't think this would happen. I've never had a problem like this before. 
@_date: 2013-10-12 05:56:41
Sending money in the mail is an awful idea. International wires cost a lost. Bitcoin costs next to nothing.
@_date: 2013-10-23 21:29:50
I like this. Yea, it's nice.
@_date: 2013-10-31 08:54:59
Will do a repost tomorrow. Thanks. I'll post on bitcoin talk as well. 
@_date: 2013-10-31 19:17:28
BAC? Is that cash deposit into your account? I was accepting MoneyPak, Cash deposits, and inter-bank transfers. 
@_date: 2013-10-31 08:23:10
I'm glad I could help. It really sucks though. Honestly. I have no clue when this will be sorted out. Thanks for your input.
@_date: 2013-10-31 09:35:33
This is what I'm thinking happened. Thing is, the deposits were mostly small, and it's not money laundering if you can see where it's going. I'll edit my post as soon as I get more info.
@_date: 2013-10-31 09:34:11
Already went in. They just got on the phone, talked a little, then said there wasn't anything they could do for me.
@_date: 2013-10-31 03:12:33
It's okay. Thanks for giving this post attention. I'm seriously getting physically ill because of this. I have no money to pay rent or buy food. I just want justice.
@_date: 2013-09-19 22:56:00
Teach me your ways
@_date: 2013-10-31 08:24:07
That's a month or two without the money I need to survive. This problem has created a much bigger one in my life. 
@_date: 2013-10-31 19:21:08
I've told the bank I am me, multiple times, and in person. 
@_date: 2013-10-31 05:07:41
What you said.
@_date: 2013-10-04 00:34:59
These are all allegations. You only know one side of the story. How often do you see the media telling one side of the story. If you were to really to have read what had happened then you would see that he "put a hit" on someone through their very own contact. Does that make any sense to you? Also, when looking to see if there was anyone that went missing under the supposed bounty, no one had been murdered. Get your facts straight. 
@_date: 2013-09-20 09:32:27
Faster pavements as in what? I feel like a money or anything along those lines is not very safe
@_date: 2013-10-31 19:43:48
Excuse me for wanted a serious issue to get some attention. What's up with your attitude? You're on the internet. No one cares for your opinion. 
@_date: 2013-10-31 19:16:40
What's the difference between a bank and a credit union?
@_date: 2013-10-12 02:41:25
Right. The uses of bitcoin are endless. International wires have ridiculous fees, and I'm afraid Dwolla will start a domino effect. Other companies will follow suit because crypto currency is technically a threat to fiat. It ends hyper inflation/deflation to an extent. Bitcoin can be used to feed the world. The more people that adopt it the more unified we can become as a species.  
@_date: 2013-10-31 19:23:43
Look it up. It's my way of comic relief. I do need some you know. 
@_date: 2013-10-31 02:55:06
Fixed the link. Sorry!

It was a want to buy for $75
@_date: 2013-09-20 00:00:20
Thanks for the info. I didn't know how it really worked. New to his whole thing. Bought .30 btc at 55$ from a California seller a couple days ago with a MP.
