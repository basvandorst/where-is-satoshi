I should also say that whilst personally I’m a believer in bitcoin, I am not saying it’s the be all and end all, another crypto may overtake it at some point.  I just believe that it seems the brand has taken hold, all mainstream press coverage seems to be about bitcoin rather than cryptos generally.  For anyone from another subreddit of any other cryptos please replace the word bitcoin with the word cryptocurrency in the OP.

Thank you for your comment.  You are of course correct, however when I say hodl, I do not mean people should hold everything, forever, just hopefully not a MASS sell off by a lot of people (the hodl crew are going to slaughter me here).  A general hodl of most of your bitcoin. People should not be scared to cash out small amounts of bitcoin.
Personally I keep a certain % of my wealth in bitcoin, once that % reaches too high due to and increase in value, I sell some to rebalance my investment distribution.  My overall wealth goes up therefore I can hold more value of bitcoin at the same %.  If the market drops, (I’m not talking a sudden dip but a sustained price, rare recently) I buy to rebalance the %’s.  Bears and bulls make money, hogs get slaughtered.
