If you're spelling it the wrong way, then you know what to do.

As somebody who wants to buy just $20 worth of coin to get started, my strategy of waiting is working.

Did you try restarting your phone? That worked for me.

Instead of using 0.00000001 to count Satoshi use 0000000.01 
When it gets to : 0000001.01 that's bits. From there on you use kilo, mega, tera, and so on as denominations. One full bitcoin then becomes 100 megabits. It's the same as computer language so it's easier to understand. 
It's all about the decimal.

Are you getting the unable to downloaded message? That's what I'm getting.

It's something I don't understand but If I get into it now I might be rich or at least happy in the future.

Fuck this solar system. Go to the next one over, but only after I buy my first $20 with of BTC.

We should go full on Weyland Corporation, Sci fi,  Mass Effect universe and get some futuristic man to sell bitcoin. Sell a cyber punk utopia then slowly reveal the world as it is today. Get some schmuck with a phone with nfc  capabilities to tap on a neon covered at to get some bits. Show him buying some purple glow in the dark liquor by then tapping his phone on a bar screen or something futuristic. Then flash to a couple teaching their kids about money by transferring bits from the computer to a phone.

This has probably been said a million times and you can downvote me to hell if you want. People are confused because the system asks them to wait for a million bits to turn 0.00 to 1.00 The average Joe doesn't count value to the millionth of a something. I don't go around saying I have a hundreth of a million dollars. I say I have Ten Thousand dollars. The term bits should simply refer to the decimal what we stop counting in tenths or hundredths and start using whole numbers. I understand that that fucks the system up because you use mili and deci and the like. What I don't understand is why not start the system at bits for 1.00 then kilabits, mebabits, gigabits, and so on. Use satoshi for the first 100 of a bit. 1BTC is then the same as 1mBTC. It's congruent with how we determine the value of memory on a computer and people are used to counting that way. 
IDK I've only been following Bitcoin for a couple of weeks but I've seen this type of stuff pop up a lot.

Yay there's one in PA! But it's still a two hour drive from where I live.

I'm not sure on that. You can ask over on @_date: 2014-07-28 17:25:58
Anybody that's downloaded something in the last 20 years should know a least a kilobyte, megabyte, or gigabyte.

I'm pretty sure the 90s nostalgia that Pete and Pete would bring to Bitcoin could be great for the price.

It's a loan through Bitcoin. Users can take out a maximum $25 in bitcoin if the bot deems them eligible. The loan recipient has 30 days to pay it back at 2% interest. (the number I think I saw.) You can use the coin for whatever.
@_date: 2015-04-16 00:08:30
From what I can gather from response was that the loans are based off reddit karma. More karma gets you close to the max loan which again is $25. If you don't pay the loan back, you start to gain negative karma. The more negative karma, the less you can take out, until you can't take out anymore. 
He also said it's a spinoff of a project that is having. So I'm guessing he knows more about the technical workings behind it. 
This was the response if you want to read this.
