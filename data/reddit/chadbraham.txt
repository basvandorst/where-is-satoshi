Yeah, I just opened my wallet from 2014 with nothing in it lol. Oh well...

Yeah I agree with that other guy. Selling a few now would be a decent idea. If it continues to go up, then you make more money on the bulk of your coins. If it goes down, then you have 25% that remain strong while the rest drops, which pretty much offsets a lot of your losses from a potential drop. You could estimate how much you think its going to drop and do it by that percentage if you think a random 25% isn't good enough.

I think the traffic to these exchanges is so high that it's acting like a DDOS.

I'm just trying to figure out how much to buy, and when. Looking at the charts from the past year, I'd like to see it correct to around $8k. I think I might buy in half of what I have to spend when it drops to $11k again, and then the other half when it hits $9k.

At least they went down around the same time.

The bubbles aren't going to end bitcoin, what he means is that the price rose too fast to relatively stable.

I agreed with you at first, but then I realized people used to pay for groceries with checks.

had the answers all along- sidechain compression makes everything better!

Yep, bought once yesterday and then bought some more today.

He actually addressed that response in the AMA.

I'm really glad it finally got into the $8,000s. If you look at the chart for the last year, it was growing pretty steadily until it hit 8k, and then it jumped up way too fast. I feel like it'll drop a little more and then steadily increase a little for each month. The boring times after a price drop are the best time to buy imo.
