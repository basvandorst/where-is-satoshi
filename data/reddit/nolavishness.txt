It's hard to say how that will play out in the U.S. But if you want the answer to that question, just follow current events in Zimbabwe and Venezuela, two places suffering from currency hyperinflation. People *need* to use money for everyday life. If the local money sucks, like it does in those two countries, then people will use another type of money, be it bitcoin or cowery shells. And if btc and shells are illegal, people will just use them anyway. Money is the ledger of a society

In venezuela there's quite a bit of crypto use and also quite a bit of mining. Even though it's not happening on a grand scale and it's still fairly niche, it's definitely happening and what's more important, it's happening more and more *because* of what's going on with Bolivar depreciation

wow, that whole thing; the post by ECB and the beautiful troll fest underneath. I laughed my ass off. I found the whole thing to be very gentleman indeed!

Possibly. I think the compromise is a tail emission in coins after the initial amount is mined. Some cryptos have a tail emission of newly mined coins that makes their inflation less than 1% a year forever. There is no threat of hyperinflation while at the same time ensuring that a *little* bit of new coins will continue to be mined every year. This incentivizes the miners

wait until they complain to give it back. They wouldnt have give you the refunds if you didn't complain. Make them go through the same mission so they know what it's like.

These estimations by wallets are wildly inaccurate and it makes people pay more than they have to

I think what the statement means to say is that the U.S. isn't nearly as secure as some of us might feel. The economy could go to shit and the dollar could easily no longer reign supreme as a global reserve currency, and suddenly the U.S. could be a poor country

XMR and BTC are the only two cryptos worth a damn, IMO. Everything else out there is garbage

k. would you mind posting receipts for your mortgage, savings and debit accounts? Let us audit your life, if you're so open to it. What's your credit rating? who did you vote for last election? How many times have you been married? If you don't value privacy, you should have no issue telling us all that on this public forum and posting receipts. Mind you, I'm not asking for your pin code, just your statements

As fun as it is for us to track big money across the blockchain, I would feel so uncomfortable having my finances out in the open like that. In a way, this is both a feature and a bug in Bitcoin.

It's a cumbersome process, tho. And you get rekt by fees from moving so much money around.

Very interesting indeed. I almost want a big market failure to happen just to see how crypto will react. My guess is that at first crypto will crash as well, but then later down the line, especially in a prolonged bear market for stocks, with a ton of QE, a lot of money will move in to crypto. We'll have to wait and see. One thing is for sure: a systemic market failure on a global scale will happen sooner or later. There's just so much debt, and shadiness, and uncertainty. The black swans will fly in flocks
