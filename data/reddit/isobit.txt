Same here. Then again, all crypto exchanges seem dodgy AF.

It literally went down seconds after I went to withdraw....
Fuckery going on. They had that "update" earlier, and it's been going up and down all day. But there is no chance this is a "bug". 
@_date: 2018-01-04 16:55:13
Yeah it seems to be ok now, but... 
This might have something to do with Meltdown et c though.

Just a quick question re blockchain.info- what's stopping it from going the same way MtGox did? Couldn't the people running it just, you know, take off with the BTC?
@_date: 2014-04-01 14:54:22
And how could they ban China anyway? Their a continent lol!

Am I the only one around here who thinks busting up all the drug smuggling places was a good thing for bitcoin?
I think more people are ready to invest now that the "criminal elements" are "gone". Know what I mean?

Bad design decision. It looks like shit. $ and £ and € inspire(d) confidence. It needs to be clever, it's going to become the very symbol of an economic revolution. For that to happen it needs to speak to the common man. Crossed out m will not do that. In fact, *crossed out* is linked to things being forbidden, bad, or out of date.
This is counterproductive design, go back to the drawing board.

Interesting point.
@_date: 2013-11-30 20:57:30
It is being retweeted a lot now, because these news are still not that mainstream. But we're getting there.
This is exactly what I want - a sub where we can take the big look at what is going on and start to systematically organize information about bitcoin so that it is better understood and hopefully increasingly followed.
Thank you for your comment!
@_date: 2013-12-03 14:52:56
I completely agree. Also, brick and mortar provides something tangible for new people to see for themselves other than just this nebulous idea of bitcoin.
