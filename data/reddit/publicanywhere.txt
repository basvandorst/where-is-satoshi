I think it can be two-fold; one would be that the market simply is not liquid enough to withstand .2% of the market being sold over a period of months. That's an extremely worrying liquidity problem for the *whole market*. But I think the more systemic risk is definitely exchanges but for another reason; if they fall under SEC regulation and they're being run as they are now, I'm almost certain that you'll see fraud charges - you certainly have money laundering, wash trading, pump scheming and alot of other shit that happens on these exchanges.

Do you know how much the trustee sold at 6k? Because as far as I've read, he just stopped offloading. He still has a ton of BTC to sell. I'd understand the argument if he was able to load off the whole batch and the market absorbed it. But he didn't. Essentially what I'm arguing is that if you only need 400m to move a 200b product, that points to a severe liquidity problem in the market at those levels and above those levels. I just don't see that as a bullish sign. :)

I think we agree completely - the exchanges need to be regulated to protect investors and their assets against manipulation and theft. Something as retarded as Binance's different "coin competitions" is extremely sketchy and probably illegal, but people love it. Check those out if you haven't. Also, something as simple as an IT audit from a 3rd party security firm, not even that has been carried out as far as I'm aware.

Absolutely agree! Bonus: The exchanges, that should have been regulated yesterday, allow for leverage and margin trading - this will ensure that the market will fall *even faster* (Because of automatic liquidation of postions) when bigger players step into the market. Bonus 2: In the equities and futures markets you have circuit breakers and limit down which halts trading activity when volatility spikes above a certain threshold - this would be nice to have as well to stem panic selling IMO.

It boggles my mind that anyone would think that dumping 0,2% of the market cap and tanking the price 70% is in any way bullish. Please explain how that is an encouraging sign.

Some people have tried with Network Value to Transactions ("NTV") but it's not a valuation as much as a correlation proxy - in other words the correlation/causation argument. Market capitalisation (as described on CoinMarketCap fx) is extremely misleading as it only looks at the price and not the amount of btc changing hands.

As I understand it, what you're basically arguing is for the free market mechanisms to regulate the space itself - and there's nothing wrong with that - in fact, in principle, I completely agree. But the fact is that if you want crypto to go mainstream, which would benefit us all, people want to know their money is somewhat protected from blatant manipulation. I don't want regulators to touch the technology (i.e. the blockchain) but I certainly do want them to regulate exchanges. Exchanges are not part of the traditional blockchain, but they have become somewhat critical to the ecosystem of the blockchain. The exchange is *not* your friend, they're a nescessary evil to obtain the technology for yourself - and I see the sentiment towards exchanges as wrecklessly positive right now. I guess we do agree on some things though :)

Okay, just read this article from WSJ -  - seems like Bitcoin and Ethereum are considered commodities by the SEC and is therefore not under their juristiction - they should still be under the CFTC instead. So it seems they don't have to register with the SEC for that reason. That leaves some of the biggest exchanges that allow trading in ICOs which the SEC have asserted are companies. This could get pretty ugly imo.

It's definitely not impossible, but I think we also need to look at the market fundamentals; the biggest exchanges allow people to trade on leverage *at least* 1:3 leverage. That means that people are getting margin calls on their positions, and the exchanges liquidate these positions at market prices (meaning they just dump it at whatever price they can get in the order book)... In an illiquid market, that tends to create a big move. Not to discredit your theory, but it could also be explained with market fundamentals.

This isn't about educating the investor - this is to avoid the very capitalism that you're talking about - big corporations and hedge funds actively manipulating this new (relatively) new market. We HAVE to have regulation of the exchanges and the market mechanism, to protect investors.

I think you're thinking MBS/CDOs. CDSs would be the insurance. 
Anyway, it seems pretty clear why Goldman has bought into this; this is a new established security with alot of volatility because of the illiquid market. They're going to manipulate it and when you own an exchange, that can be fairly easily done.

Just curious; which of the exchanges are registered with the SEC, and what documentation do you use to determine this? As far as I can see, no exchanges are named here: 
@_date: 2018-03-04 21:22:59
As long as "real" utility (i.e. volume used for utility vs. exchange volume) is this low, anything can happen because *everything* is price speculation. And it is also quite worrisome that a large percentage of crypto investors have no idea how to determine the value of the (or any) network. So to your question, in my opinion, nobody really knows

Bitoin from 20k to 6k?
@_date: 2018-03-09 21:31:06
No. The reason is because the market is illiquid. MtGox and others provided liquidity and not enough people had the confidence to take the other side of that trade until we were down at $6,000. If sellside liquidity would have continued, we would have continued down. My point is; the market is illiquid, and prices were (probably still are) inflated.
