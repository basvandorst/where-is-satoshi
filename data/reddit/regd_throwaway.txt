The way she's playing with her hair and when she is said it all to me - combined with the tone of her voice, her hunching, shifting and eye movements. I don't think she's as much of a liar as she is nervous, but she definitely thought she had landed a big one, realized she was off and is now just trying to play along as though she was right when she knows she's not. That's my interpretation, at least. I don't hate her, after all we've all been in that situation. However, I definitely think she should've done a better job and not rushed through with this thing, which is honestly unforgivable.

Yep, in my mid twenties. Plan on being successful. Already had a moderate amount of success and see that Bitcoin is a great way to change the world, put pressure on the old order/establishment and possibly be a bit more successful than usual. Thanks! (However, I personally think that gold will reach about $5,000 an ounce by 2020 and will be worth up to $10,000 within the next 2 decades - I have more difficulty accurately figuring out where t.f. BTC will end up going. In all honesty, I feel like it could hit $5,000 next year and drop to $500 by 2018, or steadily climb to $50,000 by 2032. I have no clue.)

I like that I'm not getting downvoted to hell like I suspected I would since I'm fairly new to this all. **Anyway,** I definitely sense a sentiment that things are going to be going up big time... which doesn't seem unreasonable to me (why I'm ready to buy). Why do you think it would be so drastic and so soon, and do you think there will be sufficient price support to keep it at that level and not drop back in a year to where it is today?

Thanks, this is useful for sure.

There's no such thing as a free lunch.

Ha. I've done tons of research. Kind of have it boiled down to this, and can afford to risk ~$2K on what I think will not go down too much... just want to get some additional input.
@_date: 2014-03-05 06:26:39
True, true. What I'm referring to going from $7 to $700, or $12 to $1,200 - even if it's back at $665, it's still within that *"first"* 100x increase. What I'm saying is that very few markets or assets see growth where it goes from $8 to $800 or $5 to $500... then from $650 to $65,000 - that's just some *hardcore* growth. I hope it does, don't get me wrong! But past trend are **NOT** an indicator of future trends - if that were the case then my housing would have made us all trillionaires.

Well, Democrats aren't exactly known for having a stellar knowledge of finance or economics.

One of my favorite quotes in this is in the comments section where it says, " Disruptive technology doesn't wait for consensus or ask permission of incumbents."

Yes, I actually am quite familiar with it. I also know that sometimes it takes a while for ideas and products to be absorbed/adopted after introduction. By the way, I'm fine with price volatility since I don't intend to spend it just yet, but would prefer to not be buying at a peak, see it go between $2,500 and $250, and then in 6 years from now have it back at $700 like it was today. I'm looking for a long term store of value - even better if it will deprive fiat currencies of their buying power and help advance the economy/global currency systems into the 21st Century.
**Edit:** By the way, thanks for sharing that video. Looking forward to watching it tomorrow!
Anyway, about adoption: Bitcoin is interesting because it's like the Ron Paul 2012 campaign - people are paying attention to it now and learning about him, but they just don't quite get it. It's on the cover of the Wall Street Journal, on Bloomberg and getting yapped at by Senators, but people aren't latching onto the idea just yet because it's pretty difficult to wrap their head around/integrate with their personal habits just yet. I feel like in the next year, it could become "normalized" in terms of the idea, but it could also be suppressed from rapid absorption due to the fact that processing times are slow(ish), setting up wallets is complicated, security is an issue and the media will squawk at anything like Silk Roads or Mt. Gox. **Long story short,** I definitely think things will normalize in the next 2-3 years, but can't tell if that will happen in 6 months or 36 months!

Thanks. I have stocks, too, but don't see as much upside in them as with Bitcoin or gold. Any reason why an even split between Bitcoin and gold? Could have probably also done 1/2 BTC, 1/4 gold, 1/4 another asset... or 1/4 BTC, 1/2 stock, etc..

Ah crazy! Didn't know. Was he actually a billionaire from Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-03-06 05:41:36
Well I mean that's kind of what BTC miners do for us, so yeah we're automatic oligarchy

And most of them were funny posts, so despite how they were all just "buy buy buy!" even I laughed and upvoted - plus they had a point. I'm actually getting a decent mix of people saying I should diversify across other asset classes, however
@_date: 2014-03-05 05:39:48
Yeah, and we live in some turbulent times. Just look at the shenanigans in Eastern Europe. Diversifying doesn't sound like a terrible idea, and gold has been a highly valuable asset for millennia more than $BTC (not to knock BTC, just saying it's not that ridiculous to want other forms of secure currencies.)
@_date: 2014-03-05 06:18:23
Quadruple? Honestly, I think both will definitely double or triple, and both have the potential of quadrupling. However, **A)** I can't say how likely I think it is for either to quadruple, **B)** whether BTC will drop down from that in the long run, and **C)** which of these, if not both, will shoot up even more than just 4x and when?

**Not the NSA, but [FINCEN.]( It's a subsidiary of the Treasury.** They collect something called SARs - Suspicious Activity Reports. Coinbase files them, as shown [here]( and [here.]( - look under "Responsbilities" or do a Ctrl+F "SAR"
More on what, exactly, SARs are (if you honestly don't already know about them):[here]( and [here.]( - basically how you're constantly being spied on by financial institutions and they have to submit these things on X number of people whether or not they actually observe that much suspicion.

Yup. Pretty sure they wouldn't be as open minded but I'll think about posting.
@_date: 2014-03-05 06:15:36
I can go along with that line of reasoning. However, do you really think that there's a legitimate likelihood of BTC going up another 100 fold in the next several years? I just feel like every market I've seen before does not experience two rounds of absurd growth like this!

"Let's change the corrupt financial system by not understanding a thing about finance, getting degrees in journalism/anthropology and finally blog about the dangers of Bitcoin!"

**A)** In 2011 when someone offered me about 150 BTC to drive him on a 6 hour trip and back... I'm good with numbers and remembered roughly how much it was, despite the fact that I almost laughed at him for how ridiculous the proposition sounded. Flash forward two years and imagine how ridiculous I felt.
**B)** *The ledger.* I'm trained in accounting and think that double entry bookkeeping is one of the most revolutionary creations in mankind's history - easily top 10. Bitcoin is just like that, except so much more sophisticated and in-balance. I don't even understand it completely, but I understand just how powerful it is by looking at it.
