Yes, when I checked while logged out 30 minutes after I posted there were only about 60 comments that weren't shown. I checked because it's a bit unusual to not get a reply in an active thread. I currently have reddit gold so I clicked 'show all comments' and couldn't find my comment. There have been times where the mods sort the thread by controversial or the comment allowed after traffic has died down so I was a bit heated when I said my comment didn't show because I honestly wanted to learn more about the LN.
Thank you again for answering my questions!

I have a few questions. It would be much appreciated if anyone can answer them.
* How does the LN know which hubs for my payment to go through?
* Can the LN hubs know who initiated a payment and who the recipient is? If so, how does the LN prevent censoring of payments?
* Do I pay a fee every time my payment goes through hub?
* What do I do when the amount I want to settle is less than the on chain settlement fee?
* How is the preventing of collusion between a number of central hubs enforced?
* Is it true that LN hubs will have to submit to KYC/AML laws?
* I think the value transacted on LN will surpass the value settled on chain because people are too lazy/cheap to settle. The situation is a tragedy of the commons where no one will run an on chain node because it is more profitable to run a LN node. It will increase the incentive to attack the base layer. Can anyone address this concern I have?
* My biggest concern is when is the timeline for a production ready LN to be released? Elizabeth Stark (co-founder of Lightning Labs) said that LN is ["not 1+ year away. We're working to release in &lt;6 months."]( That was two years ago. I understand that there is much testing needed so wouldn't LN be at least another year or more away?

They don't. Do they get more money by implementing an altcoin or segwit? Probably an altcoin. Just pass bitcoin TX fees onto the user.

What bitcoin has over Aadhar is a supply limit, no central authority, and is borderless.
Without going into economics, a currency with a limited supply is more valuable than one that isn't. You will get disagreements here because bitcoin is based on a different economic theory (Austrian economics) than the conventional one (Keynesian economics). 
Same reason as above with no central authority. Imagine having your account frozen because someone wanted to? Some believe having a central authority is necessary for money. Bitcoin doesn't and it's working just fine. Different economic thoughts influence this, too.
For borderlessness, it would be a nightmare to roll out a version of Aadhar for the world. Every country would do it their own way and it wouldn't be easily compatible from country to country.

Gold has other properties that give it value even if it's not used as a transactional currency, but bitcoin doesn't. USD has value because it's the world reserve currency and you must pay taxes in USD.

But the utility gives it the underlying value allowing gold to become a store of value.


I'm glad to hear that. Some people here are claiming that it is the decentralization aspect of bitcoin that gives the underlying value but I disagree with that. It's definitely a benefit but decentralization is not utility.

'Good store of value' is relative. It just has to be good enough. For money to have a store of value, it must initially have value. What gives bitcoin its value?
Peter St. Onge states:


[From Cryptocurrencies and a Wider Regression Theorem](
And Jeffrey Tucker states:


[From Bitcoin and Mises’s Regression Theorem](
The reason bitcoin has value to begin with to become a store of value is because you can transact in it. If you can't transmit money, then the whole point of bitcoin is moot.


Yes, if the dollar was being inflated faster than dogecoin. If you were in Argentina or Venezuela you would rather use dogecoin over the local currency. Lucky for us, Satoshi followed the Austrian school of thought and placed in a coin limit.

Technically, yes, but they do not have the financial incentives to do so. If they change the 21m limit, they will crash the price which they do not want to do.
@_date: 2016-12-15 00:33:38
The difference with the 21 million cap is that it can be divided infinitely. If an infinite amount of TX can fit in a 1MB block there wouldn't be a debate.
Block time interval and type of signatures don't affect the economics of bitcoin.

Why not? It sounds like segwit has to get activated before 2MB activates.
@_date: 2017-05-23 19:19:48


as versionbits have been designed to have fixed activation periods and
thresholds for all bits. Making segwit and 2Mb fork activate together at a
delayed date would have required a major re-write of this code, which would
contradict the premise of creating a minimalistic patch. However, once
segwit is activated, the hard-fork is unavoidable.
Can anyone explain how this would work?

Thank you for taking the time to reply.


My understanding is that miners and industry is kept in check by economic incentives. If users don't like the direction bitcoin is going in, they are free to leave or fork. It is the job of miners and industry to do what's in the best interest of users to profit off of them.
Yes, I agree exchanges are key in letting people decide with their money. I guess UASF is a more direct way.
Although I disagree with UASF, it's well within anyone's right to run it. I really do love the economic freedom cryptos allow! I feel I have a much better understanding of the UASF viewpoint now. Thank you.
@_date: 2017-05-23 21:34:25


How do you measure near-unanimous? Luke Jr.'s node count? (Completely serious).


No, they are trying to figure out what most people want. I am still free to run any other implementation as are you.


But how do you know that the users are legitimate? IMO, users do control bitcoin. It's not in the direct way that you want, but anyone is free to sell or fork at any time.


That's fine as that's your right. I think you are creating a fork without near-unanimous support for UASF because you are severely overestimating the proportion of the user base that is for UASF.
I know your time is valuable so I appreciate you taking the time to respond. I just don't know how you are supposed to accurately measure what you call near-unanimous support especially for UASF.
@_date: 2017-05-23 19:10:18
I really hope it activates. maaku7's post comes off as hostile and that kind of attitude is counterproductive and got us in this mess in the first place. Support for UASF is way overestimated imo.

I'd say we're at enthusiasm. There was a bunch of media attention with the $100 is now $70 million, bitcoin pizzas circulating again, and new ATHs which brings in new money. I have no clue how high greed and delusion will take the price. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 14:31:47
There shouldn't be infighting because the NYA participants are supposed to follow the roadmap. If all the miners agree, there shouldn't be a long lasting split. Are you talking about 100% consensus? Because that has been argued many times that there is no way to accurately measure that besides hash power.
I think big block miners actually want big blocks. If segwit miners go back on their part of the agreement, there will be a split. It will drastically hurt the price so it is in their best interest to not do it. Some here are talking about big block miners doing it to save face or spite or politics. What if it's what they actually think is best for bitcoin? 
Then there will be a fork and the market will decide.
@_date: 2017-05-24 15:33:58
Dang, I totally misunderstood then. I thought segwit would activate at 80% with code included to activate at block X. Sucks.

@_date: 2017-07-17 23:50:49
No, opinions don't matter. What makes me cautious is if the segwit proponent miners switch clients after SW activation but before the 2MB hard fork. I don't think they will as I don't think they are particularly against 2MB.
@_date: 2017-07-18 15:18:45

Core development is centralization and it is in the process of being decentralized. Same with communication channels.


You don't need to be. Anyone is free to leave bitcoin or fork it at any time. 
Companies do represent a large portion of users so it is part of the ecosystem. It is not a democracy in that the minority is forced to do something because the majority says so. 


No, it means you can have representatives if you want. All coinbase users indirectly support coinbase by transacting and keeping their coins there. There already is representative agreement whether you like it or not. Your views are represented by Core. If you do not like it, you can write your own client which many are doing.
It can still be decentralized but still have representatives. You can try dismissing me and my arguments but the fact is, each crypto itself is representing its participants. I don't know if you're trying to insult me lol.
The difference between crypto representation and government representation is freedom to participate or not.

@_date: 2017-07-18 15:17:14
Again, how do you measure ecosystem consensus? You can say NYA is a representative of the ecosystem. Others might claim business interest, corruption, or politics but I don't see it that way.
The only reason segwit is going through now is because of the NYA. If it is betrayed, there will not be another agreement and it will be settled through forks. 
Both sides think they have more support evidenced by Core's release of segwit but no activation. I get the impression that you think big blockers have maybe 1/3 ecosystem support and about 50% miner support. I think it's about 50/50 ecosystem wide and &gt;75% are not opposed to larger blocks.


Those people will be left behind if segwit miners follow through with the NYA.

I'm saying *somebody* will create a successful crypto if it is not bitcoin. I only point to eth as a testament to the fact that new cryptos gain traction faster and faster rather than cryptos dying out.


You have a source for that? Their slogan was 'silver to bitcoin's gold'. It lost its second mover status a long time ago. It holds its spot for first altcoin ever but other than that, it doesn't have much going for it. I'm not dismissing it, but other coins have much more potential, imo. If bitcoin fails, Litecoin could possibly take the top spot. I'm just saying that if bitcoin fails, cryptocurrencies have not.

No, because of the blockchain and proof of work, miners who attempt shenanigans will fork themselves off while an exchange that does this with user funds will suffer no consequences. A malicious government will have to have greater than 51% hash power while a malicious gov can force an exchange to do what it wants. I'm not saying exchanges or banks won't exist but that they are points of centralization. That the users of an exchange have no recourse if it disappears but if a miner disappears, it has little effect.


Collective confidence doesn't matter, it's human nature to forget. Something will spring up because there is a need for a P2P currency. And it will be better than the one before it. As long as there are pioneers and believers, the crypto space will live. After the the kinks and problems are worked out, the average person will hop on. I don't doubt that bitcoin's failure will be a seriously blow, but it won't be a fatal one.


Yes, it's the blockchain Cambrian explosion. Look how fast Eth got to where it is. Litecoin was not an improvement at all. It's an exact copy of bitcoin except coin limit, emission, and scrypt. Nothing new. Because it improved with segwit, its price has gone up a bit. Eth has surpassed litecoin a long time ago. The third generation of cryptos, the ones with something different and unique to offer, have been successful in gaining new users.
@_date: 2017-06-11 18:25:37


Old habits die hard. Even if one side gets their way, there is no way to enforce it on the minority. The politics only go as far as trying to convince people to follow the politician's fork.
The minority can HF or move to another coin and they can co-exist, too. The politics would be, hey join my coin!
@_date: 2017-06-10 22:46:14
It would probably be easier to join one with the properties you like. Starting a new coin is not going to gain traction as it doesn't have the history and security of bitcoin.
You'd have to some how convince all holders to jump to the new coin every time. That's the point of a hard fork, to let the users decide.
It seems like you want a coin that is perfect from the start, but I don't think that's possible.
It also seems that you are against hard forks at any cost.
@_date: 2017-06-07 16:09:29

Sorry I don't get what you're asking.


I think it is. It's like proof of stake. The more funds you have, the bigger the hub you can host to get more fees. 


I consider exchanges to be centralization which is why everyone says to keep your coins off of exchanges. The difference is that I can still do on chain if I don't want to use an exchange. With hubs, they will be pricing other on chain TX out that it will be too expensive for the everyman to use on chain.


I don't get why not? The crypto environment today is like the Cambrian explosion. The fittest crypto will survive. If bitcoin fails, there will be a crypto that fixes what was broken in bitcoin. If that fails a better one will come along. Crypto as it fills a niche that fiat can never hope to provide which is a non inflationary decentralized P2P cash. That's why Satoshi is such a big deal, he made it all possible.

It's not a democracy; I never said it was. You are free to leave whenever you like and participate in another crypto or fork bitcoin. No one is forced to follow your so called centralized miners/exchanges.
Again, if you want to keep 1MB forever because you think it's the best plan of action, you are free to do so. You just can't force miners and other users to do it.

It is not tyranny of the majority. Anyone is free to leave the chain the majority is following at any time. It's only tyranny if you are forced to follow the majority.
I think I get what you're saying. That every coin should be static and "live" or "die" by the people adopting it?
That's an interesting perspective. I don't think it's really practical because money is network effects and adding new users while keeping the current ones is the point of upgrading. No one wants to start over with a new coin because the costs of research and risk is much higher than upgrading.
@_date: 2017-06-08 16:39:51


For me, it was easier to use bitcoin before the tx congestion and fees. it's nice to not have to carry a wallet. and fun to use too :) Really felt like the future you know?


Segwit, if it activates, will take a while for everyone to use segwit TX. I would guess 3 to 6 months being generous. But I wouldn't be surprised for it to take up to a year. I hope segwit2x goes through. 2MB would provide immediate relief and buy time for segwit and layer 2.
That's what I don't get about lightning. Say for coffee, I don't see Starbucks opening a LN channel for every customer and locking up funds. I wouldn't even do that as a user. If I lock up $100 dollars a month for coffee and have to pay $10 on chain TX fee, that's a 10% increase in price to buy coffee. You could bring that down to 1% by locking up $1000 but who wants to lock up $1000? I read that you can just pay a small fee for using a LN hub hosted by some service but then I wouldn't consider it decentralized anymore.
@_date: 2017-06-09 18:35:05


The market decides and they are part of the market. If people disagree, they leave the service or bitcoin. Until bitcoin's existence, you couldn't leave central bankers.


It is decentralized and distributed. It may not be to the level you want, but it's sufficient. It was the main point until it wasn't and alts started gaining traction. What is the main point to you? 


What's the point of a decentralized currency if you are priced out of using it? 


That's fine as that's your right. Most people are fine with segwit2x. If it happens, majority will move on and you will be left behind. What's great about crypto is that it grants freedom so everyone is free to do what they choose and that is what makes cryptos work.


I do care and what the world to change for the better. If only the centralized services you seem to hate can only afford to make TX on chain and you are forced to use off chain centralized services, is it really decentralized for you anymore?


So self interest? That's what makes crypto tick; everyone's self interest.

Alice: "You should use X crypto. It's like bitcoin but better"
Bob converts some BTC to X crypto. Done. Remember it's super easy to go from crypto to crypto relative to fiat to crypto because there are services now that cater to it.
It's the reason you see cryptos growing so fast. Prior crypto experience + better services = faster adoption. It took much longer for bitcoin to get to where other cryptos are at now.
