Satoshi is an idiot.  1 MB is less then a floppy disk. Is this guy living in 1995?
Now spammers that have more money then me are spamming the blockchain and I can't even afford to send my non spam transaction. 
Really the guy had a good idea but other people had better ideas, you can clearly see that because the other crypto are working as advertised. On his website bitcoin.org Satoshi clearly still says that Bitcoin is fast and cheap. What a bullshit artist this Satoshi. He can't even admin he is wrong and his solution did not work.

Can you also fork ?

I will spoil Bitcoin for you. You will die before your mother understands how it works and accepts it as something not black magic.

of course it matters, a coin that is bought for a certain price on a exchange wants to be sold by the owner for a higher price then that coin was bought at. While coins from outside the system that flow in, let's say miners coin might be sold at whatever the exchange rate it.

1) A block size of 1 MB limits the tx to about 2600 tx of 400 byte per 10 minutes. This limit made sense in 2010 when large mount of coins where released and they did not have much value allowing people to abuse the network. Now this limit does not make sense anymore. 
2) Bitcoin allows n to m transactions where multiple signatures are required for ownership of coins to change. Instead of directly changing ownership of coins or fractions of coins we save up on a network outside of Bitcoin and then once in a while we settle only the difference. So if I owe you 1 bitcoin and then later you owe me a bitcoin we settle this offchain so nothing on the chain ever  changes. 
3) Download the Tails OS .iso which comes with Bitcoin software. Check the integrity of the .iso by calculating the SHA256 hash and checking it with the one on the website. Make sure your computer is offline. Generate individual bitcoin addresses and write down their private keys or create a seed and write down the seed which will be 12 random words. Also write down the Bitcoin addresses that are connected to the seed. Now you can safely send your Bitcoin online to one of those addresses. Your cold storage will be a piece of paper. Keep the piece of paper safe and never put it on a computer and if you do only on one you trust or not connected to the internet.  If you intent to just keep some Bitcoin save for 5 or 10 years without ever changing your mind even on a market price crash then this will save you some money as a Ledger Nano is only handy if you use it to make tx with once in a while. 
4) Proof of work have been proven to work in practise. The rest is still theoretically. If you want to learn how Proof of Work work then [read the original white paper]( that started everything Bitcoin and crypto.

They are paying 40 because that's the lowest fee that gives them a 100% the tx will be in the next block. If they don'tdo they can't operate their business. What bank tells you to wait between 2 and 3 hours when you come in to grab some money from your account?

About 20 months, maybe 2 or 3 less.

It just signals that internally in the blockstream camp things are not going well.  Nullc is not working for them anymore. They have a hardly functional project (LN) that is not going to get used anyways. (cause BTC is for settlement and a store of value, not for payments). 
Cobra,Theymos and Sirius own bitcoin.org and bitcointalk. Cobra and Theymos are completely anonymous, sirius is a public persona. 
Conclusion: internally they are not that certain anymore that BTC will survive and somebody is trying to eat of both wall. Probably theymos being cobra himself. 
What a joke ... and what drama when that Tether bomb explodes, crashing the markets and dropping BTC prices below 4000 again.

You forget about BTC being traded back and forth, creating a lot of volume. So the same coin get's traded over and over again. This is different from a inflow of BTC not yet  on a exchange. Even with 1000 or 2000 BTC, you would cause a significant drop.

Not in the next block, so not within 10 minutes (on average).
Go ahead and make a 1 sat/byte tx and show that it has one confirmation within the next block. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 01:36:48
You have to understand that a business like Bitpay has to deal with a whole bunch of payments that depend on other payments. So you get chains of tx that need another tx to confirm first. For single user sending a tx to a exchange with the lowest fee per byte and having to wait a couple of hours (or longer) is no problem. But when you have a business like Bitpay these tx need to confirm asap. And the time in between needs to be somewhat reliable. When you have 10 tx and 9 of them confirm in the next block but the last one takes a full day ... well that can kill your business.  That's why they go with the lowest fee that will get them confirmed in the next block ... on every tx. Which is around 40 at the moment. They are paying extra to bypass the unreliability of BTC tx. Imagine being a bank and when a customer comes to withdraw you have to tell them: There is a 95% chance I have your money in the next couple of hours ... but a 5% change it will take 8 hours. 
This is why the LN is so needed.

Sucks that Jihan controls 80% of Bitcoin's and bcash hashpower.

This sub has banned everybody that loves Bitcoin so only the haters remain. 
edit: I got banned for this comment.  How can permissionless be one of the features of Bitcoin when the mods don't like permissionless and take people's permission to post here away when they don't like what you posted. While they take about the dangerous of centralization they run their little empire like centralized dictators. Bunch of hypocrites.  Any body else replying to this comment got a ban or removed?
