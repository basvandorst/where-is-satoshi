Except you live in a house.
And you.... wait what do you do with a Bitcoin.

Right. But what do you do with it?
What value does it bring other than the fact that a screen tells you that you own it.

I watched the price fall from $13,800 to $10,600 in 24 hours last week.
Trying to make any price predictions is pretty much useless when volatility is this high. It could just as easily be at $20,000 next month as it could be back to $3,000.

By defrauding millions of Americans out of their homes after baiting them in with predatory loans.
Yeah, what a success story he is.

Just because you give two answers doesn't make one of them right. If I asked *"Does 2+2=9 or does 2+2=12?"* the answer would be neither, because 2+2=4.
I'm telling you for a fact that nobody here would ever believe that Satoshi could ever do anything wrong.

You're right, I am being a little too general. The majority of casual browsers like you understand that. 
But there is also a large minority that is very cult-like and treats Satoshi like the next coming of Christ.

No I don't. It's way too niche.

That one made me laugh too hahahaha

All he cared about was the relationship between Workers and Capitalists. There is no laborer being exploited to mine bitcoins because it's all done by a computer so I'd assume he wouldn't understand it, and if he did he wouldn't care.
The one person I would want to get an opinion from is John Meynard Keynes.

What people don't get is when we do get to the point of a Marxist Utopia (and we will inevitably) we won't be calling it Communism or Marxism. In all honesty, we may still call it Capitalism. When you hear people like Elon Musk and Bill Gates talking about a Universal Basic Income, those are elite capitalists espousing a central Marxist idea.


I don't have a problem with Marx's critique of Capitalism, the problem is that the solution shouldn't be to burn it down through violent revolution. Marx surely never intended it to happen that way.

Because the people who criticize it so strongly put people who support the capitalist structure on the defensive.
It's brought millions out of poverty and has kept millions trapped in it. We all know the system could be better, but so far, it is the best we've got.

If it scares you then you shouldn't buy bitcoins! I see it as no different than walking into a Casino with $5,000 and putting it all on red. 
Except the only difference is, instead of a chance for a 100% return, the amount of possible return is infinite!

Fuckin hell... I love how they consider Bitcoin to be "worthless" while they have literally **HUNDREDS OF TRILLIONS** of dollars tied up in worthless derivatives.

Nobody would believe it was the real Satoshi.
Satoshi isn’t a person anymore, he’s more like a deity or a messiah to some people. People talk about Bitcoin these days with a religious fervor as if what they’re doing will change humanity forever. No doubt it’s cool, but it’s not going to have near the lasting impact that people think it will. My dad used to tell me an old saying when I would get all worked up about something that always brought me back down to Earth:
*What has been will be again,*
*what has been done will be done again;*
*for there is nothing new under the sun.*

That’s not how market psychology works in the real world. A 10% gain feels sweet enough to sell, but when the asset runs up 1000% you feel like an idiot and refuse to sell until it reaches that level the next time.
This is where the “hodl” mindset comes from. People have seen this asset run up enormously, and have therefore inferred that it has to keep running up at that rate.

The actual lesson is never tell the same lie twice
