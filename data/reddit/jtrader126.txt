I'm not sure why they would refuse a deposit from coinbase.  Chase wants your money.  But if they want to close your account just open an account with a different bank and move your funds.

Can't wait. That exchange platform is going to be Stellar ;)

I'm curious. Is Monacoin also a popular payment crypto in Japan? 
@_date: 2018-01-02 02:39:50
I don't see why any exchange should have to promptly make changes because the developers of a coin changed their code.  It's not hurting the newbies coming in, they have alternatives available on coinbase that offer cheap transactions. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:14:08
Yes. Let's just stick our head in the sand and not allow any outside opinions 
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:51:47
litecoin has the same scaling plans 
Be more worried about Dash.

As it stands right now there is nothing in the IRS code explicitly saying cryptocurrency is not like kind. It is stated in the new tax law though, but it is not retroactive. The IRS can't just make up its own laws, it has to pass congress. For 2017, anyone who declares like kind will win everytime, there is nothing in the 2017 tax code to dispute this.

I personally don't think it is feasible. But I am sure you will get many different answers.  But it definitely could have its use cases for sure in many applications.
Another good place to ask is r/BTC as they tend to be more skeptical of Lightning network.  But it's good to learn about the various ideas out there.

Government will never banned crypto. It is too late now.  A lot of these lawmakers have skin in the game now. Too many citizens have investments tied up in this. There are retirement hedge funds accounts dipping their toes into this. 
 I am willing to bet that just about every lawmaker has received emails with private keys to addresses loaded with crypto as a "gift" to join the club.  This is how whales and ICO starters can lobby congress.

It doesn't matter if millennials hold 10%.  
What is happening is that we are seeing young people ecstatic about investing into cryptocurrencies  but have zero interest investing into traditional stocks.  This does anger the older generation that has built a sizable holdings in those stocks. Are you not reading the news?  Are you not following peoples reactions to the dramatic rise of cryptocurrency?  Take your head out of the sand and look around.

ETH/ALTCOIN trading pairs are increasing exponentially across almost every exchange. I've been following this for a month and it is becoming evident what exchanges are doing. One of the main reasons Bitcoin sits at top is because everything else is traded against it, but that is changing drastically on an exponential level.

I heard there is a particular sect of them that prefer using Monero for day to day operations 
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:51:34
Wrong. 
Like kind exchange doesn't apply in 2018 but it does in 2017. See the new tax law.
But you are welcome to pay extra in taxes, I doubt the IRS will complain. 
With the massive decline in USD over the coming years, US will do what all the other countries are doing and recognize cryptos as legal tender. Otherwise the economy will go into the stoneage. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 10:30:01
It won't be years before cryptos are being used as a popular form of payment in some parts of the world. 
I give it one year. 
LN better hurry up.

Those with the largest holding in the traditional investments are overwhelmingly boomers because those holding are their retirement funds.  Soon we will see a shift in these more risky retirement funds into cryptocurrency, but by the time that happens many of the millenials already have large positions in crypto.  The tables have turned. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:38:39
Dash has sub penny fees and they will be rolling out point-of-sale software in Q1 of 2018 that will put Bitcoin to shame. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:40:40
Only if you cash out into fiat. 
Never cash out into fiat. That is the whole intent of cryptocurrencies. 
Trust me. You won't have to cash out. We are about to witness a gradual decline of USD and a run up into deflationary cryptocurrencies, especially useful cryptocurrencies that are cheap to transact with. 
The people who take profits into fiat are hurting themselves. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:14:25
Listen here. The very intent of cryptocurrencies is for the population to store and use their wealth outside the hands of any government or bank that can seize it. That is what gives it power. That is why we are witnessing such a global rise like we have never before seen. That is why we will see even more of a rise in the coming years. 
The facts are this. The vast majority of people are never going to be paying taxes on their crypto to crypto trades.  I would say more than 90%.  Is the IRS going to jail or fine half the millenial generation? That would be political suicide. The country will be forced to recognize crypto as legal tender soon enough or face economic suicide. The USD is going to decrease substantially now that the world has a means to transact without it.

It was a California judge that issued the order, that is why. 
Coinbase should relocate headquarters to Texas. From what I understand Texas is becoming the hotbed for cypto in the United States.

Boomers have large positions and stocks in their retirement portfolios and they are relying on millenials to prop up their holdings.  It baffles and angers them to see the next generation buying investments that they don't already have a large position in, you can see this all over the news and in the comment sections of traditional investment sites like MarketWatch.  
@_date: 2018-08-01 14:13:42
LOL They just released it.  Working product buddy.

Any coin that relies on 3rd party funding for developer pay is **centralized by default** and prone donor to takeover. 
@_date: 2019-02-26 20:56:46
I didn’t feel it necessary to repeat what is common knowledge about the centralization of BTC 
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:57:12
Absolutely! I don't think many people comprehend the implications of this or are even aware of it. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 05:50:19
Owning 1,000 Dash you can set up masternode that pays 7 Dash a month. That is $3,150 a month just for holding Dash. Which would be income tax, not capital gains.  And Dash will appreciate faster than Bitcoin, which it has proven to be doing for several years.

That pictures is showing how its referral program works, which is a small bonus feature to get the crypto started. It has nothing to do with how their lending works. 
Bitconnects entire platform is designed to be lent through their site so they can use their trading bots to make profits. Trading bots make money in crypto markets, this is fact, especially whales who use lending bots. It is not surprising someone would create a token like this. The interest payments are small and certainly sustainable considering how much profit whales make in these markets. I'm sure the devs are making a fortune and that is fine. I receive my interest payments daily and I am happy.

than what's the point?  You give up everything for exactly what in return? Only risk.  
At least crypto has potential upside.

What the hell are you doing?  Don't go before parliament and start calling top marketcap coins a scam!   I don't care about bcash but you are a freaking idiot and you are hurting the whole space. These lawmakers are confused as all hell and you are throwing this into the mix. Good lord you were the wrong person to do this.

There is a really good project called KuvaCash that is documenting this and working on the ground to bring crypto to the people.
Good teaser trailer of the project.

Neither one of them.  EOS was a long overpayed ICO.  They might deliver some cool tech though.  Dash has been around for a long time.  I remember watching the youtube videos of people shilling Dash Masternodes back when Dash was $4. Wish I had picked one up, but they have made a lot of in roads to be called a scam. 
@_date: 2018-07-24 22:41:01
It's not a good privacy coin though. You have to download a 56GB blockchain to use the wallet. If you use a remote node that destroys the whole point of having the best privacy. If anything the zksnark coins are better privacy coins. 
But dash isn't a privacy coin. Dash just offers the option to obscure ones balance by mixing coins using their 2nd teir network functions.
@_date: 2018-04-06 08:44:47
both can't scale though  
Don't buy into the LN bullshit.  Merchants are not going to use anything that takes a week to close a channel just so they can get payed.

It's only a matter of time before coinbase loses its dominance. They have been making extremely poor business decisions. They should have booted Charlie Lee a long time ago and brought in some real talent. Adding Litecoin and not some of the more exciting coins is going to be equivalent to Blockbuster passing up the oppurtunity to buy Netflix for 50 million. Coinbase will go down as one of the greatest business blunders of all time.

Take a long look at Bitquence.  They still have an crowd sale going on. It will be very popular and similar to PRISM/Iconomi.  Theyare going to make it fun and mobile for investors. Very solid team of mobile developers. The mobile generation is going to love Bitquence.

Buy Stratis.  Stratis is doing what Ethereum is doing but they are coding using Microsoft coding language.  There are going to be way more Stratis side-chain developments from big business than with Ethereum.

No. Altcoins are not valued in Bitcoin. They are traded against value. The exchanges just happen to have everything set up for Bitcoin trading. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 10:35:18
Would be $5000 if Bitcoin has been able to quickly handle its scaling issues.  It's to late now. Altcoins are running wild with speculations.
