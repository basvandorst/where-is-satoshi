I just registered on Bitcointalk.  However still cannot post.  Could you forward this post for me?

I am looking for a lawyer to sue this company.  Does anyone know a good one?
Some basic facts:
 
1. I replied immediately to their email, saying the transfer was not from myself.
2. The destination address has not received my BTCs until now (not seen on blockchain, let alone confirmations).
3. I request refund from them but they declined, saying the bitcoin transaction cannot be reversed.  However the transaction has not been initiated.

Thanks very much!

Do you mean MtGox took my bitcoins, not a hacker?
@_date: 2014-01-04 03:17:35
The address is not wrong.  I copied it from MtGox.  I agree.  It is weird that the transaction has not hit the blockchain.
@_date: 2014-01-04 01:26:47
Yes.  That is very necessary.  The same story could happen to everybody.
@_date: 2014-01-04 06:09:06
Yes that was what I thought.  However I don't have a private key.  Let me see if I can get it from them.

Could someone tell me what to do?  Which authority should I go to?  Japanese or American?
@_date: 2014-01-04 06:59:33
I am willing to offer 1 BTC for anyone that can get my in contact with mtgox.  But I don't even have 1 BTC now. :(

Could you explain what is a "plea on Bitcaiontalk"?  I have no personal MtGox contacts.
@_date: 2014-01-04 02:02:54
Is there any way for me to find a live gox person to talk to?

The transaction number can not be found online.

I am trying to work through MtGox.  However they don't seem to be willing to help.  Is there any way to talk to some real person there?
@_date: 2014-01-04 07:27:46
That is right, if I can recover.
Updated the text.  Don't know how to update the title.
@_date: 2014-01-04 04:53:28
Thanks all the same.
@_date: 2014-01-04 01:09:35
I know I fucked up.
But is there a way to stop the transaction before it enters the blockchain?
