Humor is one way of dealing with things like this.
@_date: 2014-10-30 13:51:05
Yeah, small businesses. 
@_date: 2014-03-28 15:07:53
I'm aware of security, i was commenting on something else entirely.
@_date: 2014-10-30 13:14:37
I don't think they'll have too much bitcoin business coming in to make it risky for me. But i am a bit worried, as anyone else invested is :-) 
@_date: 2014-03-28 12:29:56
Funny how in the US that's a good thing, but here in israel anything associated with army gear is cheap crap.
@_date: 2014-02-17 22:47:19
How do paper wallets work? How can i make them?
@_date: 2014-01-08 00:33:13
Play it, it's fucking amazing.
@_date: 2014-11-16 18:48:32
Which dumb mistakes?
@_date: 2014-06-03 18:20:23
bout time, ain't it?
@_date: 2014-10-30 12:30:04
Holding. I'd be taking the coins myself and giving local fiat to the people running it. 
@_date: 2014-05-27 07:53:11
Just make sure you read everything they have and go exactly by their instructions, there might be scammers out there.
@_date: 2014-03-28 14:36:16
I'm sorry, i have no idea what you mean.
@_date: 2014-01-16 15:06:20
Is anyone surprised really?
@_date: 2014-10-30 15:29:34
Good question, gotta ask the owner.
@_date: 2014-10-30 15:30:23
Good idea :)
@_date: 2014-02-23 16:39:21
You, to the ~~moon~~ top!
@_date: 2014-04-22 12:01:37
Can anyone explain the sentence?
I'm not sure i understood it correctly.
@_date: 2014-05-12 17:25:32
3BTC? Whoa. I'll start dancing for that kinda tip.
@_date: 2014-03-04 09:26:58
Can anyone dumb this down and explain what this does and how this might effect bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-10-30 16:44:04
I plan to spend most the btc i get each time i get some btc. That way i buy in slowly.
@_date: 2014-10-31 00:51:01
@_date: 2014-02-02 15:51:03
If you're gonna say something is wrong, you might as well explain how it's wrong :)
@_date: 2014-05-04 16:19:17
In the meanwhile you can watch free to play legally, no BTC involved though.
@_date: 2014-05-28 18:06:42
A 10-Minute (...) [23:10]
I'm confused..
@_date: 2014-03-03 16:17:34
How do paper wallets work?
Can i, as just an average joe, print and give em away?
@_date: 2014-10-30 15:30:56
Been on the coaster for years now ;)
@_date: 2013-09-12 12:30:19
Yeah, good luck with that.
@_date: 2013-12-10 09:20:43
Why not just leave that bank?
@_date: 2013-11-24 13:30:52
That's pretty cool.
@_date: 2013-11-24 16:17:03
Electrum doesn't seem to be on the list on btc.org :P


What are old coins? Coz i'm pretty sure mine are quite old.
@_date: 2013-09-16 12:37:40
BTC quick are pretty nice, took em a day and a half to buy from em and i was able to do so using google wallet.
But they do charge your for the convenience.
@_date: 2013-09-12 13:05:31
The resources they would need to allocate to prove a single wire transfer was BTC related renders the whole thing moot.
@_date: 2013-11-24 13:20:30
Is there anything like QT i could use? I like the localness of it.
@_date: 2013-10-05 17:08:58
So aside from a backup team incase the original one decides to break btc, are there any other benefits?
@_date: 2013-12-10 10:03:09
Tomorrow morning then?
@_date: 2013-10-31 10:48:35
There should really be a dumbed down version of this that ELI5s.
@_date: 2013-12-12 22:56:16
I wouldn't wanna pay that much, but considering the work, it seems like a fair price.
@_date: 2013-09-20 20:04:41
Can you explain this? I've been baffled by why 'it' gets a free pass from 's.
@_date: 2013-12-12 22:48:59
Any idea what the pricerange is going to be on this?
@_date: 2013-09-20 21:11:50
Very confusing to people who aren't native speakers.
@_date: 2013-10-31 16:30:53
Why? I honestly didn't really understand what's good about this wallet. I understand it's supposed to be more secure, but how to they plan to achieve it?
@_date: 2013-09-13 06:53:52
I can already hear my inner lawyer nagging me about the risk of slander :\
I wish someone would pick this up, but it'll be no easy task.
@_date: 2013-10-05 17:00:38
a. Thank you :)
b. So we might end up with two types of bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-10-31 16:48:49
ELI5 is more of an expression then an actual request to be talked to like a 5 yo.
It's like simple.wiki
@_date: 2013-11-24 13:31:56
Is there a place that reviewes them so i can decide which one is best for me?
Also, won't i have to transfer the coins and then lose some due to the transaction fee?
@_date: 2013-12-09 10:04:57
I can seem where i could edit the link the QR is pointing to..
@_date: 2013-09-12 13:29:58
MtGox is far from the only place to get bitcoins. And as someone who lives in israel, i can tell you people would go out of their way to make it nearly impossible to find. Using Bitcoin Fog and whatnot.
@_date: 2013-10-05 16:38:53
Can anyone explain a noob what exactly this is and why's it good?
@_date: 2013-09-20 20:13:57
What about: "Dad's car" vs. "Dad's drunk again"?
@_date: 2013-10-29 11:21:01
What is this to the moon thing?
@_date: 2013-11-24 13:27:29
But isn't the point of the time it takes to go through is to verify it's a legit transfer?
What would stop me from sending fake transactions?
@_date: 2013-12-01 12:26:49
I've had a rather good experience with btcquick, but that was back when their commission was around 1-2$.
Try and talk to them? Maybe they'll be able to help.
