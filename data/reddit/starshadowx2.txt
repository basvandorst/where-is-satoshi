Yeah, it's not really a bad thing, but I was just confused as to why my online banking wasn't working until I called them and they let me know. It might be a good thing for QuickBT to mention in their FAQ.
Back when I used CaVirtex however many years ago I didn't have this problem, so RBC must just be more cautious concerning bitcoins. 
The transaction still went through at the time, they just sorta held my account after the fact so I'm not sure how protective it is though.

With my early investor bitcoin profit money I bought a 2007 Hyundai Santa Fe, I didn't need a fancy car.

Yeah, Satoshi Nakamoto is like John Smith, or John Doe. That's why lots of fiction has things like "Nakamoto Corp." or whatever. It's just easy and sounds cool to western people.

Satoshi is like the "John" of Japan. It's just a basic, default name.

I'm seeing Bitcoin as more like Digg. Extremely popular, worth a lot, cusp of mainstream, and then failure because of mistakes made and Reddit's better alternative. Like you said 


[This article]( could be a future template for Bitcoin and Ethereum. Just replace Digg with Bitcoin and Reddit with Ether and it pretty much tells the story.






Now i'm not saying Bitcoin will ever fully die. It's quite well engrained into the crypto ecosystem and does have it's use cases. Same as Digg does still exist, it's just not the same. Ethereum is still young and has much to grow, but there's a lot of great things being built on it and huge amounts of innovation whereas Bitcoin doesn't really have that.
EDIT: Just realized made the same sort of argument lower down.

But it says the full amounts have been sold. 250/250, 25/25. And all the other prices &gt;25, that should show up on the main page (caVirtex) as the high, but it doesn't.

That was a Christmas movie wasn't it? Mickey and Minnie each got each other presents that had to do with the present they have away. It's an old story AFAIK.
