Funny, even the experts know shit about bitcoin. How should normal people outta there trust this? - told me once somebody. I cannot argue with that now.
@_date: 2015-03-02 00:53:56
This good or bad? (For europe and for the bitcoin)
@_date: 2015-03-18 20:46:59
In 2-3 years maybe OB will be ready.
@_date: 2015-03-03 21:39:58
According to the president of the US, yes.
@_date: 2015-03-03 21:55:32
25 BTC?! Dude you can do whatever you want with my nude pics.
@_date: 2015-02-25 22:16:14
you also dont know google right? and wikipedia?
@_date: 2015-02-18 23:22:04
What is this legal?
@_date: 2015-02-19 18:04:02
I did never understand this "x years behind" stuff. And why I can jump some years in 10 minutes?!

May 2010: An exploit allowed 92bio BTC to be hacked.
Could somebody please explain me this? Was the exploit in the Bitcoin Algorithm? Or in a specific software or website? So somebody is out there with 92billion BTC because of that?
@_date: 2015-03-15 21:17:12
As a bitcoiner take an AMD, stop supporting scum/corrupt companies like nvidia.
@_date: 2015-02-09 23:32:34
I have enough of "democracy". Our current money systems and banking world is running on "democracy" - but it´s corrupt and shitty as hell. So Bitcoin can happen the same thing, bad news for me, I thought it´s better.
@_date: 2015-02-26 13:53:39
They need testers and feedback from non it people because "this should be for them also", but if you want to test openbazaar there is nothing ready online to test - you have to learn about github, download stuff, compile and configure.
@_date: 2015-02-20 18:11:57
Yes I heard about Electrum, I also using it (for small amounts) - but as I understood Bitcoin Core is a little bit more secure. I'm a noob, but as I understood with Bitcoin Core I'm full responsible for my wallet - so there are no words and seeds and stuff like that people could hack? It´s just me and my system - and if somebody would hack my into my Linux Mint or steal my encrypted hdd and decrypt that stuff -&gt; my fault.
So for electrum I just need my seed right? That is pretty easy. But still I think for my BIG WALLET (lol no it´s not really big I'm not as rich as people in the US) I would like to use Bitcoin Core. It is also the 'official' Wallet and I like this Full Node support stuff.
But when I'm wrong somewhere please tell me guys, that is why I ask here. Thx!
@_date: 2015-02-18 23:37:43
Using Bitcoin Core 0.10 - am I using multi-sig automatically?
@_date: 2015-02-23 13:06:27


I just typed my name, phone and bank data. That was it, they checked my data and I was able to trade. Is that more complicated?
@_date: 2015-02-23 10:19:00
You have to remember: the most of the people outside are no nerds... or intelligent. Some of them are even girls. So you cannot start with blockchain, hashes and stuff like that.
@_date: 2015-02-06 10:10:04
Do I get something for sharing full nodes somehow? :)
@_date: 2015-02-04 20:10:36
Im new to BC, but I was reading that Bitcoin core or Armory are slower but much safer - no?
@_date: 2015-02-21 10:42:59
Is greenaddress.it a good one to support or are they the same?
@_date: 2015-02-21 16:50:15


Uhm, there is Circle listed as web wallet.
@_date: 2015-02-18 14:26:57
Not working for germany and austria right?
@_date: 2015-02-05 20:11:09
I'm not that good with this github thing.
Is there a list where you can see the stable and rc/beta versions and download them for your OS?
Because on the officual site I only see an old version (here 0.9.3) 
@_date: 2015-02-19 19:17:45
No I dont get it. When my bitcoin core wallet synced last week, that means the recent block cannot be a year old. But sometimes I see years there.
@_date: 2015-02-11 01:12:23
Ok that´s good, then I am reassured
@_date: 2015-02-22 15:22:55
For Kraken + Germany you need at least Tier 3 -&gt; picture of you, your ID, residence documents and passport you have to get and post. 
@_date: 2015-02-18 02:46:25
lol - yeah I was hoping for another solution
@_date: 2015-02-05 18:51:49
Noob here, I know Green Adress:
What is now the difference?
@_date: 2015-02-26 13:41:02
There is nothing that the US Government cant regulate to death. 
Remember the Iraq war only because of the $? If they want they can do whatever it takes to destroy something.
@_date: 2015-02-09 13:49:48
So this is good because we can enjoy anonyme porn paying?
@_date: 2015-02-06 01:18:08
Hi Noob here - who would use this? If you have a desktop/laptop you still need this?
@_date: 2015-03-03 15:22:51


That looks really awesome!
@_date: 2015-02-18 14:57:48
On  I cannot see any registrations for the beta(?)
@_date: 2015-02-19 19:15:32
Nah it´s somehow not that easy. I have to select a provider and need after that some login data. 
Even if I try the hola vpn with US the same thing is coming. 
But if this CNN episode is coming on youtube or somebody will upload it via torrent - that´s totally enough.
@_date: 2015-02-10 23:01:55
Oh, that is good then. 
...But what will happen if all coins are goin a nobody will use mining?
@_date: 2015-02-20 17:12:20
I do not know any of them. But IF there are some of them - I cannot imagine it is over 10$
@_date: 2015-02-19 18:05:16
so when 90% is mined the price will go up?
@_date: 2015-02-22 20:19:02
where did he post that? and how people know it was posted by the real one?!
@_date: 2015-02-21 10:54:56
Uhm...well I hope it never goes under 200$... because then I lost a lot of money actually :/
Talking about 1$ makes me feel bad.
@_date: 2015-02-27 13:13:26
Oh no, how can a typical US company do such things?!
@_date: 2015-02-28 18:39:21
Any news about this guy?
@_date: 2015-02-26 10:45:23
Openbazaar if sooo far to be finished. It´s sad but the devs are doing weird stuff there.
@_date: 2015-02-11 11:29:27
Yes but what about the ninjas?! Not a single of them is a ninja! But we need ninjas, because they know stuff - ninja stuff, without ninja stuff we are lost.
@_date: 2015-02-13 12:40:11
I do not understand all of them, but there are a lot.
Banks do not have these problems right?
@_date: 2015-02-12 13:06:13
Did somebody get the 0.3 BTC?
I need 0.3 BTC :(
@_date: 2015-02-17 21:28:36
So there is no desktop version? Or is for desktop electrum and for android mycelium the best option`?
@_date: 2015-02-20 17:09:15
MEGA is the best, thx for sharing.
@_date: 2015-02-23 13:12:03
Oh boy, the comments on their website are the best. I dont think google translate can handle them correctly, but you should give a try... they are just "wow"
@_date: 2015-02-13 10:27:18
So there is now another software on the list of the NSA. Let´s hope they dont crack that thing too fast.
@_date: 2015-02-21 17:01:39
Where are we right now?
@_date: 2015-02-21 20:18:19
They can see you are making business with Coinbase and when telling  them you do not know about them -&gt; account freeze. Not a good idea. Just sayin, brain and stuff.
@_date: 2015-02-25 22:25:22
Coinbase - their support is for shit. I know that. You really  have to scream on twitter, facebook or on reddit before they check something.
@_date: 2015-02-10 22:42:00
Right. That´s why we will also have a lot of problems with "Bitcoin" if Banks are gonna start using it more (and they will). So everything will be the same as now? Maybe.
@_date: 2015-02-10 22:43:07
Yes but because of this, one day nobody will help with a full node right? Because you dont need that.
@_date: 2015-02-05 18:36:47
BC Noob here, I already have the full chain with Bitcoin core - do I really have to delete everything and use something else now?!
@_date: 2015-02-16 01:17:53
are there already exchanges using this?
@_date: 2015-03-01 11:20:55
Rich stupid and lazy muricans are not the target of bitcoin - why the hell is this so hard to understand?
@_date: 2015-02-17 23:45:06
Never tried to send or get tips - I should start now reading how this is really working.
@_date: 2015-02-27 23:08:17
Kind of embarrassing that it took 5 years for you to realize. But at the end better now than never.
@_date: 2015-02-19 10:58:03
lol...I thought it was a video...but this is just a picture? Made with ms paint? :D Nice
@_date: 2015-02-18 01:12:20
Ah nice thx this is really easy to use
@_date: 2015-02-22 00:38:53
NO I dont like the video. I like mushrooms, mycelium and naive blonde girls - but this video is nogo.
@_date: 2015-02-17 21:47:25
Nah $1800 should go for bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-22 20:21:48
as my best friend from one the bank said: if the Bitcoin will succeed in the US, then we know it was actually made and is controlled by them.
And as I see that the government is starting supporting btc in the US, I'm getting kind of nervous
@_date: 2015-02-19 17:55:39
Is there a way to get this later if you dont have the time at 9PM and you are not from the US?
@_date: 2015-02-13 10:31:27
Yes is it the Algorithm of the whole bitcoin thing or just a wallet? Or is there no difference?
I thought when BTC came out, they said the algorithm is perfect and nothing can go wrong?
@_date: 2015-02-13 10:09:10
Noob here: Somebody explain please why? Is this about the upgrade of the bitcoin core wallet?
@_date: 2015-02-25 22:15:00
Yes almost all feminists are idiots but we have to ignore them, you can write as many open letter you want this will make things just more worse.
@_date: 2015-02-05 20:40:12
Thank you!
@_date: 2015-02-22 14:48:00
At first germany got fcked by the Banks, then by Greece. Why? Because the whole corrupt money system as it is right now is not working. But they are still defending it as hard they can.
@_date: 2015-02-21 10:52:47
Noob here, wait a sec I dont get it. I understand you can transfer btc to a gift, but how do you pay with this gift?
If am at McDonalds and want to pay at the cashier with my gift, how does it work?
@_date: 2015-02-17 21:44:43
That is why I somethimes think that not even the bitcoin is safe from the US.
If they they control almost every hardware manufacturer - how the hell can bitcoin be secure and stable?
@_date: 2015-02-22 20:22:40
@_date: 2015-02-10 22:24:13
Bad news, but at the end they are not fckd up as the apple store
@_date: 2015-02-25 22:00:53
Gox also just freezed the accounts - everybody will get back the coins...later
@_date: 2015-02-13 12:50:19


Oh no. So there are now a lot of people there who got billions of bitcoins because of some hacks they did years ago?
@_date: 2015-02-10 22:35:14
To open an app - you just tap one time. If the app is not loading because it´s buggy or whatever then it´s not the fault of the shop? Sometimes we have to calm down, a lot of stuff around Bitcoin is not working perfectly yet.
@_date: 2015-02-06 22:59:17
A lot of dirt and dust - deadly.
@_date: 2015-02-23 10:55:21
It´s kraken. Because for other german bitcoin sites it´s working, just for kraken somehow not. So, yes, it´s kraken.
@_date: 2015-02-17 11:19:52
And like with the internet the problem will be that our favorite police state (US) will crack the shit out of bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-16 14:54:43
Good news oder bad news?
@_date: 2015-02-15 20:51:16
We need an "official" security check *whatever* for every online exchanger - dont know how this could work, but we need something like this so people know more about the risks.
@_date: 2015-02-26 10:55:41
Maybe only for people with a lot of BTC.
Still I think the 100$ is not worth.
@_date: 2015-02-13 12:33:38
Thank you, that sounds really complicated - I hope for bitcoin nothin will go wrong. Can we compare bitcoin with our usual banking system and transactions? Is bitcoin gonna be one day as stable as the current banking system?
Where can we read about major bitcoin updates / plans? I know about the bitcoin core wallet github page, but that is just the wallet right?
@_date: 2015-02-06 16:41:32
Are these two videos really true and worth watch or are they just so,so/propaganda?
@_date: 2015-02-09 21:31:39
Can somebody please explain me who in this bitcoin world can decides what size what is or what changes in the algorithm can be done and what not?
@_date: 2015-02-22 11:37:56
Good thing, Armory is my 4th favorite btc wallet
@_date: 2015-02-06 15:40:28
Oh I understand. But if people don't get anything for helping with this full node stuff - one day everybody will use a "non-full-node" solution right? But then bitcoin wont work anymore, or did I miss something?
@_date: 2015-02-22 21:16:10
They still not changed the answer :D


Requirements for each country are evaluated based on the country's regulations and we believe it is very important to follow these regulations in order for us to provide the safe platform.
@_date: 2015-02-20 23:38:46
Wish openbazaar devs would give us some easier way to test and help them than this "you have to download the source, then compile, then hax0r this and that..."
@_date: 2015-02-04 20:31:28
Thx good to know :)
@_date: 2015-02-23 15:15:43


Except that for kraken, even if you want to do a 1$ trade, you need scan of ID, passport, selfie and residence documente. Yes they are the same.
@_date: 2015-02-21 20:16:35
Let me guess: you livin in the US?
@_date: 2015-02-06 03:06:41
Ok, get it. Well that is very secure then.
... but I also think that people who are able to do these raspberry, linux and script stuff are smart enough to make their everyday PC secure against keylogger, thiefs and viruses(?)
@_date: 2015-02-11 20:57:19
Na na you cannot give the state a middle finger, the state can still control that thing if they want to. If it´s not gonna work they just erase bitcoin, example: make a law that is not allowing a company in the state to accept bitcoin.
You and your nerdy friends can still send each other coins but the "big coin thing" is gone, Game Over.
@_date: 2015-02-23 10:24:48
I don't like kraken. At least not if you are german. If you want to use kraken as german you need at least tier 3: scan of your ID, documents of your residence, picture of you (selfie) with passport.
If you don't  have these, you cannot do nothing.
@_date: 2015-02-18 02:01:46
What, why?
@_date: 2015-02-07 23:55:49
Wow what an awesome video. You can see soo much, everything is explained and also we all understand why this is good for bitcoin.
NOT.
