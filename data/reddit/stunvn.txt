That means people loves USD. They don't care about the crypto.
The end.
P/S: And where is the source?
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:35:54
If you plan to sell all of your bitcoin during the crash, I suggest you use WEX.nz (former BTC-E)
They are using their own WEX (USD) currency. They require nothing. You can withrdaw to your bank, or sell WEX on the blackmarket. $1 = 1 WEX.
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:40:53


Yes. You are right. The internet is the future of the world but the investors in the .com bubble were early. They were overconfidence about the power of the internet, ended up broke after that. And look at the technology's companies share today, especially AMZN. 
I see something related to the .com bubble such as: greedy and euphoria, the media, overconfidence about the price of Bitcoin, it will never go down, supply is limited... etc.
But, the reason why people sold their stocks in the .com bubble was: they realized that the performance of those IPO companies were terrible but the price was too high. 
Well, I can say, Bitcoin is not a company, it promises nothing about performance, so you don't have to worry about it to go bankrupt.
Bitcoin is good, but pushing its price to the new ATH every day is not a good move. Look at the chart, I know how awesome Bitcoin is but please, cool it down, have a healthy correction and start rising again.
Scroll your chart to December 2016. You'll see that Bitcoin had a bullrun, break the rising wedge with 1 big green candle and suddenly drop more than 30% after 1 week. Will it happen again? God knows.
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:15:40
That will be $63
Can you capture an image?

Only fools believe in this rise.
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:21:30
This is an example of ignorance. 
OP has his own opinion. If you don't know how to answer his questions, please don't comment.
If you understand Bitcoin, you will write something that you know. But, turns out you write nonsense words. I see that you know nothing about bitcoin. You buy bitcoin to get rich quick.
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:45:18
Bitcoin is too big to fail.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:30:04

Compare to the last dip from 10k to 8k8. It will take about 4 hours to down to 0 with that speed. 
For education only.

Relax boys. Calm.
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:43:42
They will dump before that, so the Wall Street bois can buy the future at cheaper price. Say, 8k.
They won't buy the future when BTC is at 12-13k right now, it's too risky for them. 
Why buy? Because, never short BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:12:44
I'm ready.
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:58:40
Well, those bubbles share 1 thing in common: euphoria.
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:17:00
Bitcoin is in a bubble right now and it will crash. All you have to do is wait. Trust me. This rise is unhealthy, it will go down.

Sell USDT on blackmarket. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:05:21
I don't think so.
The last difficulty change pushed the price to the new ATH.
Everything on this market is totally random.

I see you guys don't understand the chart, maybe I should post something easier to understand.

It won't dip. It will crash.

It's too late right now. wait until it crash and buy. Soon.

Don't worry about bitfinex. I can make sure 100% bitfinex will never die. USDT? Nah, nobody can take it down.
Those bitfinex'ed articles are only add noise to your head.

Lol no.
220k unconfirmed transactions.. People are finger crossing right now. Just 1 more red candle and they lost their minds.

If it's a bull market, we will gain profit anyway. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 10:29:37
USDT is love, USDT is life.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:47:38
Who cares? Let's FOMO in and get rich quick.
Correction is only for weak hands. Strong hands push straight to $20k.
We are on a highway right now and we can't stop. Only moving forward!!!
@_date: 2017-12-05 08:08:24
If it hits $100K next year, I will change my name to "asshole" too... You know...

Mr.Market has many lessons for you. You will never beat him but you will learn many techniques from him.

It's normal. Welcome to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:44:56
It's wrong. You must search "speculation" not "adoption"
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:03:41
What? You don't know it?
unconfirmed transactions of bitcoin. It would take 6-10 hours to receive your bitcoin if you send it to different wallet.

Bitcoin is about technology so, I prefer .com bubble.

Yeah.. I'm tired of those Tether scam articles... 
All they do is talk about it. They knew it was a scam a long time ago, but look at that, bitcoin still rising every day.  
Everything they can do is write some text and sit back hoping the FBI or CIA notice it? LOL.
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:50:32
It will.
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:31:37
But demand for what? People buy Bitcoin because the price always rise. Demand because the price always rise?
There are too many shops accept bitcoin but I don't see anyone pay for their stuff with bitcoin. People don't use bitcoin. Why would they use it if they know the price will be higher tomorrow?
So, if they want to hold, why would they need lightning network? 
Lightning network only good when you use bitcoin to buy something. But, since they plan to hold Bitcoin for years, turns out lightning network is useless? Will you buy a pizza with 10,000 bitcoin if you know its price will be $16,000 each in the future? Hell no! How about you buy a coffee cup 0.003 BTC in the morning, but in the afternoon it's 0.001? 
**I won't use my bitcoin to buy things. Never!** 
Conclusion. Bitcoin, it's **store of value**. Just like gold. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:54:43
Relax. People can't simply take down a scam coin in this market, how can they take down an exchange. Literally, we have no power in this market (a market without regulator)

Are you insane? The banks offer many services that neither Bitcoin or any cryptocurrency can replace it.
Example: when you need money. Will you go to the bank or visit a random website on the internet and apply for a loan of Bitcoin?
Have a look at your wallet, there is always a bank's product inside.
Please stop saying nonsense thing like you wanna control your money.
Wanna control your money? Hide it under your bed, quit using any bank service And see how hard your life will be. 
@_date: 2019-02-08 04:08:36
Who upvotes this stupid comparison?
@_date: 2019-02-15 14:35:12
When people are too dumb to understand that. Bitcoin won't survive, but the blockchain technology is here to stay. Only greater fools waiting to get rich in their country currency while investing in Bitcoin hoping one day they can sell it and get financial independence.

Why you blame the banks? It's the government to blame, dude.
Zimbabwe is the oil export country. But the price of oil falling like 3 years ago push this country into chaos. The government wasting money everyday, without saving because they thought they were rich!!!
Bad things happen next is drought. No water to produce enough electricity, that means most companies have to shut down because they can't work without electricity.
So they have to import things from outside. When import &gt; export, not enough money, the price of oil fall every day. Well, you can see what Zimbabwe look like right now.

I can't believe you ask a question about that stupid fork in this /r.
Look at BTCD, BTX, BTU. The answer is right in front of your eyes.
Why do people scare of that stupid fork? 
You know what? If you lost your faith in bitcoin, and scare of BTG. I suggest you sell all your Bitcoin right now and go to sleep. You won't have to stay late at night anymore. And buy back after that day.
Thank you.

This is exactly my friend.
I told him to buy when BTC was $2700. He said it's too high. 1 week later BTC crashed and he said: "I told you!!! You tell me to buy that?"

Well, I'm happy when there are people that have opposite view with the rest. 
You know, that means it is not the end.
Think about the dotcom. Every family in the US, even housewives, boys and girls, farmers, taxi drivers, janitors, etc... talk about it every day. It was insane.
Everyone said beautiful things about the market. 
**I want to share my positive thinking way.**
So, good guy Jamie is saying things that he doesn't want to say. Sharing his opposite views to reduce the bitcoin heat. Imagine if he said: "people should buy bitcoin and store it like gold. Price will rise to $10000 end of 2017". Man, it will be crazy, people will jump in and boom!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Himself, big organizations, governments are playing the market-maker role. When the bitcoin is too high, they will release some bad news to reduce the heat. And BTC will back on track again. And it will happen again, and again, and again.

Well, in case you are talking about the market. It is really unhealthy if Bitcoin keeps rising every day to the ATH.
