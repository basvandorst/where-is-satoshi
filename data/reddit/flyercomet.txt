Satoshi Nakamoto's mysterious white paper is the butterfly that flapped its tiny wings and caused a tsunami.  What a fittingly cryptic origin story for the brave new intangible treasure.  It's probably one of the most interesting happenings of my adult life.  I wonder what will happen next.

Water, Food, and the ability to procure more Water and Food.  The blockchain can be resurrected even after the apocalypse but I probably can't.

I'm not gonna lie.  I had this exact reaction.

They are way more likely to suggest higher priced retail items to men and steer you away from any sales.  It's good that you have a solid knowledge of women's undergarments.  But it's a skill I can't pretend to have.

I am sure my bitcoin are worth the opportunity cost I incurred to obtain.  100%.  I am less sure about some new bitcoin paradigm or fantastical price increases.

I sent them an email and they will debit the doubled transaction.  Attempting to keep the funds would be dishonest and potentially criminal.

Lots of things are special for Americans.  And that specialness us catered to.

Right.  That's the issue.  I know my fiat currency is subject to inflation.  Holding dollars is stupid because they are all but guaranteed to lose value.  Bitcoin gains value so once I've converted to btc I have incentive to keep it there.  Am I missing something?

I've got to admit it's a pretty wild idea to turn meaningless internet points into meaningful ones.  It's almost ironic to turn karma into bitcoin.  If you set up an exchange I wonder what the market would decide karma is worth?  In bitcoin of course.

This is what I've been waiting for.  A man who goes to Victoria's Secret and doesn't just get a gift card is a fool.  Now I don't even need to go anywhere near the mall, brilliant.

Maybe an EMP from a large nuclear explosion.  Then we have more to worry about than bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-05 13:33:10
I respect your decision, but perhaps you could buy some small amount of bitcoin on a recurring basis so you still participate in the bitcoin economy.  Sitting on cold storage doesn't help bitcoin grow.  Bitcoin is more than a speculative investment.

Hey, guess how you get experience?  You all are just doing it the hard way.  But it you learn your lesson you may find it was a cheap one and well worth it.
@_date: 2013-10-28 13:26:21
I heard it.  They did point out that the price of bitcoin is what people believe it is worth.  I was going to object but then they followed that it is also true of all currencies even the almighty dollar.  Solid blip.

Or a bull trap where the strong hands are left holding the bag.  Unless YOU are the market maker it really cannot be said.
@_date: 2013-10-23 19:17:38
What if you're all wrong?  There is no crash and instead bitcoin stalls without losing value.  The parabola doesn't happen and everyone who offloaded coins to rebuy lower is out of luck.  
I guess it's either go long, spend bitcoin, or speculate haphazardly.  I can't abide speculation because I know I can't time this market.  Go long or go home.  Spend coins to grow the bitconomy.
@_date: 2013-11-05 16:36:57
Me.  I'm buying all the bitcoins.  
@_date: 2013-11-23 18:51:09
Why not buy some now and save cash to buy more later.  That way regardless of the price you will have some bitcoin.  Personally,  I bought like crazy each week leading to the run up.  Since then I have sold to an amount that I'm comfortable losing and set up a weekly buy on coinbase.  Why stress when you can just enjoy the ride?
