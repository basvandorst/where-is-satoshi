so now I have my wallet identifier, but i don't know my pw (i dont remember setting one up, I wrote down a bunch of stuff when I bought the coins but none of it is a pw) do i need my pw to get them off blockchain? I took a screenshot of my "QR code" is it okay to toss my piece of crap windowsphone?

I don't know if you are familiar with Blockchain on Windowsphone but I basically have my barcode, a link that says "get app"( which links me to something that says the app is no longer available, and a link to the blockchain website.... How would I move them to circle?

Would you check my reply to the last person, I understand how to get a wallet but how do I send them?

So when I scan the code and search web it shows the correct balance so I’m sure it’s my wallet but how do I access my wallet? I’ve also got a bunch of notes from when I opened my account. I’m sure I sound very dumb lol

Yea I think I have those seed words. I originally purchased through localbitcoin and stored on a windows phone which is now long gone. I can’t find my account on localbitcoin so like where do I put those seed words?

Can you suggest an app that supports raw input in Canada? Seems like blockchain and Coinbase both do not...

So I can't have the same wallet on PC and Windows Phone is what I have? And what is the payment method with this Vault of Sitashi? I thought a benefit of bitcoin was never having your fiat currency and bitcoin never linked?

The debit card thing is interesting but I'm skeptical, where do they make money?
