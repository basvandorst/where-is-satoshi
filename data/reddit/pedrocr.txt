Even if that's true it has nothing to do with running a validator. What gives users power is their ability to swing the price not their ability to run some math in their computers.

The consensus that really matters is that of the miners. When there's a fork you can have 99% of full clients saying the rules are X, if the remaining 1% are the miners and they say the rules are Y that's the chain that moves forward. The 99% would be left validating a chain that had no more blocks being added. Eventually the difficulty would go down and GPU and even CPU mining would be feasible again but by then the chain would be long dead. The consensus is whatever the miners say it is. Running a validator just allows you to know if something funny is happening but it doesn't give you a vote on the consensus at all.

That would be like saying the Agnelli family doesn't own both Fiat and Ferrari, which I didn't. They're big shareholders in both whereas before they were big shareholders in Fiat which owned Ferrari completely. This post is about Fiat, someone was saying they owned Ferrari which was true for a long time and isn't anymore. If Facebook spins off Instagram it will also be the case that Facebook no longer owns Instagram while Zuckerberg may very well maintain control of both.

Fiat used to own Ferrari, now it's a publicly listed company. They may have shareholders in common but Fiat no longer owns Ferrari.

They don't own Ferrari anymore.

This was well after the Chrysler deal. FCA was created in 2014 and Ferrari was spun off in 2016. They IPO'd Ferrari taking new investors, so the owners are definitely not the same. But all that is irrelevant. This is about Fiat no longer owning Ferrari. Even if they had the exact same shareholders, which they definitely don't, that would still be true.

That makes sense, thanks. My doubt is if you can actually make an economy function with deflationary money. We know we can make economies work by inflating the money supply in a controlled manner to make currency just a means of exchange that you should invest as quickly as you can. And that's no less "sound" money, it's just a different role for currency. That's how modern central banks have worked and world economies as a whole have done nothing but grow over the last century. I don't know if we can actually make an economy work with currency working both as a means of exchange and a saving instrument but I haven't studied those kinds of economic theories to even have an opinion. It's also not something specific to Bitcoin. You can apply the same economic policies in a traditional fiat currency economy by adjusting the central bank policy. Bitcoin just makes a firmer long term policy guarantee, for better or worse, because it requires a hard fork to change it.

I agree. Everything else should be in actual investments like stocks, real estate, etc. Currencies are not investments. Gold is historically a very poor investment. If Bitcoin is to work over the long term it shouldn't be a good investment either.

The calculation is wrong though. Wealth includes more than currency. So even if bitcoin was the only currency in the world and everyone was used to valuing everything in Bitcoin the total value of the actual Bitcoins would not be the total wealth. Companies, land, cars, etc would still have value. The total value of dollars or euros in circulation is much lower than the total value of assets that are priced in dollars or euros.

That's 7% a year of inflation, seems a bit high...

The Bitcoin USD price has been soft the last few days but hasn't really crashed. What would be the price point that would make you rethink your holding of Bitcoin as a good idea? Is there one?

The stock market hasn't even dropped a single month of gains yet.
@_date: 2018-02-06 08:05:06
That was in fact not your point. You claimed the news is already "pushing the months back" with the stock market decline when it hasn't even dropped a single month. That's just false. I have no vested interest in anything related to this topic, just curiosity.
@_date: 2018-02-06 22:44:36
Here's actual data:
Depending on how you measure exactly (because of all the daily fluctuations) there's at most a 1 to 1.5 month drop. Back to January 2nd or around that time. The exact timing doesn't matter though, the OP was claiming the news were actively pushing back the date months to fit the narrative and there are no multi-month drops to even make that possible.

It's not rocket science but it doesn't seem workable either. You think such a system has a chance at working long term? You're comfortable putting your entire life savings on a device that's internet connect and full of chips that are probably backdoored in several ways? See how the phone baseband works and then think if that doesn't scare you. Be your own bank to me sounds like a threat more than a promise.

The argument doesn't seem very strong at all:
- Pricing externalities in energy cost would be great, and it would drive efficiency across all users of energy. It has no bearing on the actual discussion though, which is not "does Bitcoin emit too much CO2?". And is instead, "does Bitcoin actually produce enough value to pay for the energy it's using?". But yeah, if all externalities were priced in we could let the market figure that out. We're not doing that for anything though, so the discussion is still valid.
- A bunch of Whataboutisms of other things that also pollute a lot with several that seem wrong but are irrelevant anyway.
- A discussion about how creating new solar can actually be paid off by bitcoin mining, and how that somehow helps get us off fossil fuels. That's just wrong on multiple levels. 1) energy transmission is extremely efficient (95%+) unlike stated 2) to actually build the mining hardware creates a bunch of pollution and then it will supposedly be ran at less than 100% usage so it only takes advantage of waste energy 3) to actually pay for that mining hardware something else has to be not done in the economy, so we're back to the efficiency argument, if we can build banking with less energy we're better off 4) the only way this actually helps provide for that hypothetical replacement of fossil fuels is if after the build-out happens bitcoin disappears and leaves the solar plant to be reused, otherwise you're just building plants to dedicate them to mining and there is no net fossil energy replaced
- Complaining about extrapolation of cost per transaction is cute but the problem is that the numbers actually work the other way around. The number of transactions stay constant but the energy usage keeps going up, so it keeps getting worse and not better as the technology matures. Second/third/fourth layer solutions need to be created for this to not be the case and that's far from a solved problem.
