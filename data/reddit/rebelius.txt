errr... Crypto on Revolut is only for premium, or people who've referred 3+ friends. And then you can't send coins to your own wallet, only hold them on Revolut.
It's great for sending Euros to Coinbase (and then to GDAX) though.

In addition to the other two responses, if you go to  they have a standard line version of the price chart and a very similar market depth chart.
If you click the "WTF" at the top right on that page, you get a pretty good description. 
Also, hovering over a point on the market depth chart will give you a description such as (for Bitfinex just now)


Which puts it in an easy to understand way. Obviously, the sellers could also cancel those orders, they don't _need_ to be filled to disappear.

That’s an estimate for the number of people that currently have over 1 BTC. Not the number of people who can ever have 1 BTC.

Just to clarify, you mean you can use either to check either, right? You don't need to use the other one?
So if I have a loaded Ledger Nano S and want to verify that I wrote the seed down right, I can buy either a second Nano S or a Trezor and load the details into that to verify.

E.g. One of my email addresses was included in leaks from BTC-E, Dropbox and Last.FM. Luckily I had nothing on BTC-E at that time.

The DCA vs. lump sum argument really only applies if you have a lump sum and are trying to decide how to invest it. If you're investing from income, you're just regular investing, which automatically has some of the smoothing benefits of DCA.
Perhaps what we're discussing would be better called Drip Feeding vs. Lump Sum.

Isn't this going to be much harder to do with the S2x coins than it was with the bitcoin cash due to lack of replay protection?
@_date: 2017-11-02 08:23:09
I completely agree that lump sum investing is the financially optimal strategy if you can stick to it. 
The problem is the “if you can stick to it” part. We are humans, and our emotions sometimes get the better of us. With the volatility bitcoin has shown in the past, many people would shit the bed if the put in a large lump sum and it suddenly dropped in price, they are at risk of not being able to stick it out and selling at a massive loss. 
Yes, if you manage to stick it out through the down times, the lump sum investor will end up with more, but the best strategy is one you can stick to, and we don’t always behave rationally.

you need to use three of these: \
Underscores form italics _like this_. \ Is used as an escape character to cancel the function of things like that.
None means the underscores aren't escaped (and there's no arm), so you get: ¯_(ツ)_/¯ 
One means you escaped the underscores so they show up, but your escape character is hidden : ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Two means you escaped the \ so it's not an escape character. So your underscores are gone again: ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
Three is just right. The third one escapes the underscores and the first one stops the second from being an escape character, so you get a full arm: ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

Well in that case they can just keep those coins and wait for the value to go back up, but I'd imagine most businesses that are selling things also want to be buying things. As they likely can't buy those things with bitcoin, it would make little sense to keep the bitcoins.

It's still trying to time the market. When you sell at 900 you have no idea that the price is going to drop to 650.

There are a great many people who sell at X thinking the price will drop and they'll buy in again at X-300, but then the price doesn't keep falling, it bounces back up to X+200.

I had thought about it before, but the arbitrage always seems to need to go one way, so for example take bitstamp and mtgox:
You buy BTC on bitstamp for cheap, then you send them to your mtgox account and sell at a higher price. This brings the two slightly closer together, but unless you have a crap load of cash to pay into your bitstamp account, you're then going to need to withdraw the dollars from mtgox so that you can buy more on bitstamp. This takes FOREVER to do, and it's not only mtgox that takes a long time to do it.
It'd be okay if sometimes mtgox was higher and sometime bitstamp was higher, then you could move the money one way, wait for the tables to turn, then move it the other way, all as bitcoin, but it just doesn't seem feasible with the timescales for dollar withdrawals.

If you sort the recent trades by price, it shows that they know 3,484 is higher than 310.6 at least on their recent trades table. Surely they don't have such a stupid mistake in their trading platform?

Are there many people who actually say it can only go to the moon?
Most of the people I've seen have said bitcoin is either worth nothing or a whole lot more than its current value, so it's worth taking a punt at it being the latter.

If you sell when the price is lower than you bought at, then all you're doing is realising a loss. If you believe bitcoin is worth something, you might as well hold onto it. If something has seriously changed your mind and you think bitcoin will never be worth $800 again, you should sell.

Doesn't this exact same requirement for merchants to be trustworthy protect the consumer from being charged the additional fees which bitcoin protects against?

I'm in the UK, so the laws are probably slightly different, but I imagine income/capital gains are treated mostly the same.
I mined 5 bitcoins back in July 2011, so the "taxable income" side of things is negligible due to the costs which it can be written off against (graphics cards, electricity). 
I gave up mining after a few weeks because it made my room really hot all the time and I couldn't play games and mine at the same time and that's the real reason I had my computer and I didn't really see the point. Fast Forward to April this year when I'm sitting at work browsing the news and there's a mention of bitcoin "crashing" down to $120 after a hack and I just thought "HOLY CRAP! I have a bunch of them and thought they were worth nothing!" followed by thoughts of what life would be like if only I had carried on mining.
Now I'm just holding on to see when they level out, then I'll probably pay off a chunk of my mortgage or something, if they drop to $0 I have adequate other plans in place anyway.

If he didn't transfer the tip to his own account, could he just pass on the love by tipping other people?

Not sure, I was replying to someone about selling BTC. I have not bought BTC on local bitcoins so I'm not sure what protections are in place. At that point the guy has my real name (from my bank account) and my bank account details. I'm not the type of person that thinks through how to scam someone unless I'm on the other end.

Can't you just give kraken ANY address? I didn't have to send them anything to verify my address, they may have done some kind of check though. 
I am up to "commander" verification with no actual checks as far as I could tell, it only took a minute as well.

Yeah, I'm british and work a standard day. Came home at lunch time, £178. Came home in the evening, £70.

Mine does it - TD Direct, but I'm in the UK. AFAIK you can split any shares, bonds, funds but not ETFs.

Except that 15,999,999 people could have 1 satoshi and one person could have the rest. Bitcoins are not actual physical coins, they are divisible, you don't need to buy a whole one.

And what happens when they actually need to pay out when a big bank collapses? Or multiple big banks collapse? The FSCS is funded by the banks too, but it's guaranteed by the government, which means if needs be, it'd be propped up with tax revenue.

It'd be nice to either have the times convert to local time or have some sort of "2 hours to go" indicator.

Do you have to use ACH for US-US transactions? In the UK, all interpersonal transfers are done by Faster Payments System, which clears within 2 hours. Unfortunately there are no UK exchanges because it's impossible for them to get a bank account.

Nah, it cost me £9.50 and there's also the (bad) exchange rate, but they don't charge a fee for the exchange.
