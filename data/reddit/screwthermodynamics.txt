Gotcha. Thanks for the info.
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:12:27
Yeah, I know. It's just that this wasn't the only one so it all adds up. 
Also, I'd really like to understand why it happened and how to prevent it from happening again. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 09:45:11
Well, yes that's all I can assume but I thought that common knowledge around this was that change would be lost? See old thread [here](
@_date: 2018-01-08 09:46:26
Thank you for this. Does Mycelium tell you the size of the transaction once you've put in the private key? ie does it tell you the actual size (rather than estimating)? I'm reluctant to expose my private key until I know for sure! 
@_date: 2018-01-08 12:25:01
OK, thank you for this. I guess I can do all of that with Mycelium. 
I am somewhat wary of using a software wallet - I was really hoping to get everything onto a hardware wallet as soon as possible rather than leaving exposed private keys elsewhere. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 16:02:20
Agreed. I think I'll do that. Do you know whether my interpretation of [this site] ( is correct? 
@_date: 2018-01-19 09:47:34
I made a transaction using mycelium (
I selected a low priority fee, and the transaction confirmed fairly quickly.
The thing that I'm confused about is the 0.0002851 BTC left in the wallet.
I learned that this arose because I changed the fee after setting the output to maximum (ie I should have gone back to the transaction amount and selected 'maximum' again once the correct fees were known).
The thing is that I didn't think that this was possible as I thought that full outputs needed to be spent and that any 'change' would be lost as a change address linked to the paper wallet can't be generated. However, this points to either a partial spend or change going back to the original legacy paper wallet.
Can anyone explain *why* this happened?
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:05:22
Sorry, I mean the sending address would pay the fee, but wouldn't the fee also be calculated on whether or not the old address is legacy/segwit etc? Or am I completely misunderstanding how addresses and fees work?
@_date: 2018-01-19 11:45:01
I didn't create a new wallet. I selected the 'sweep cold storage' method. This is really bizarre. 
I've posted the question in too and will reply here if I get any other info. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 10:26:01
Hi u/Emburu,
I haven't managed to find out any more about this. Regardless, it got me thinking - I thought that only full outputs could be spent with change going to new addresses and that, with the case of paper wallets, this would mean that change would be lost. 
In other words, how were any coins left behind at the same address? Any idea?

@_date: 2018-01-08 10:33:41
You have explained this so succinctly. Thank you, I finally get it. 
Are you able to advise on the best way of importing a number of private keys at the same time? I was planning to use mycelium to sweep my old BIP38 paper wallets.
@_date: 2018-01-08 11:20:09
Thank you. 
My original plan:
Sweep each wallet to a single address = transaction fee of 1 input and 1 output X 100
Sweep this wallet to another single address = transaction fee of 100 inputs and 1 output
My new plan:
Import each wallet to a single wallet = no transaction fee
Sweep this wallet to a new one = transaction fee of 100 inputs and 1 output
This method (importing rather than sweeping the original paper wallets) may not necessarily be easier but will definitely be cheaper than my original plan. Thanks again. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 16:00:37
Thanks. So my understanding of what I'm seeing in the representation of the mempool is correct?
edit: a word
@_date: 2018-01-08 09:47:16
Cheers! Does Electrum tell you the size of the transaction once you've put in the private key? ie does it tell you the actual size (rather than estimating)? I'm reluctant to expose my private key until I know for sure!

You're a legend.

Actually, I have a follow-up question if you have the time. I understand that you've really gone out of your way for me already so understand if not...
The only reasons I wanted to sweep my paper wallets to a hardware wallet were:
1) For security (in case anything happens to the paper wallets)
2) In order to avail myself of the BCash and Bitcoin Gold
With regards to 2) do I even have to sweep the bitcoin to another address (I plan on holding long term) or, once they're securely *imported* into the ledger, can I just transact out the the BCash and Bitcoin Gold without moving the BTC?
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:31:47
Lol. Yup, we're rarer than cryptokitties. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:09:09
I'd appreciate that. I'll do the same. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 12:36:30
Thank you. I understand this re: each coin being on the old address (currently paper wallet). 
I was hoping to do this as cheaply and safely as possible, so my old thinking was to sweep each paper wallet, one at a time, so that I could immediately also sweep for BCash and Bitcoin Gold before moving onto my next paper wallet and hence not risking exposure of the private keys for longer than necessary. 
However, it looks as though the cheaper option - importing each wallet first - will result in exposure (with a software wallet) before the bitcoin can be transferred to a ledger address. Once this is done, the private keys will all still be exposed whilst I transact out each of the altcoins. 
Hmmm...I'm really not sure how to proceed now. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:18:20
Holy shit. I just came back in here to thank the guys that posted advice only to see that they'd both deleted their comments!
In a nutshell, my understanding is correct on both accounts. Keep tabs on the mempool and also on which fees have a better transaction success ratio. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:03:46
Sure, but wouldn't the fees apply to the *sending* address?
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:47:30
Balls. Yes, that's where I went wrong. Thank you. Any idea what can be done with the remaining few BTC? There were a few more wallets so it's more than just 2 bucks. Not enough to lose sleep over but if I can recover them I'd like to. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 11:27:25
Mycelium didn't have any such option ("spend from paper wallet" or similar). Also, the funds were sent to the same address ie when I scan the old paper wallets the funds are showing as present. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:55:56
Hmmm...these are legacy addresses though so I don't think that's going to affect them. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 13:49:41
Thank you! Other explorer?
@_date: 2018-01-10 11:18:43
I assumed that I would be better off (in terms of future fee minimisation) by sweeping the paper wallets to a single address and then sending one transaction again to the ledger (so that all future outputs are 1 input as opposed to 10 input). 
I see now that there is no need to do that and that I should just sweep each wallet straight to a new address on the ledger. Thanks.
