And people keep investing in Bitcoin. This is the same as Kraken. What's good is 18,000 if you can't access it in any way and be left with $1000 by the time the dust settles? You can't even sue them

I guess according to your knowledge nothing will ever go into Bitcoin. If I am mining ores and gold and I sell gold for cash. At which point does cash go into gold? Are you really that dense?

Bitcoin is not math. Math is addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, Pi, etc etc. Bitcoin is "hey, we're not sure whats suppose to happen at this point so let's have a fork... Later on we'll have a hard fork again... Let's just keep having these forks"

I guess magical fiat just appears to pay the electricity bill that has nothing to do with Bitcoin?

The only definitive answer is that the price of anything can eventually reach $0
Also, why does anyone short any stock in the stock market? By your logic, if everyone held their stocks for life then the only way to go is up.

When you're working with billions with a b, it's a lot harder to grow your investments exponentially. Turning 50b into 100b? Then 100b into 200b? Yeah, you'll have found the secret to life

They're your average joes who have no investing knowledge, can't read a chart, and dislike it based on the fact that some people can profit both ways. They don't have time to monitor it all day every day and they only get to take one way profits. It's your mom, your dad, your grandma and grandpa who have tunnel vision for only positivity

Yes you can. Have you heard of futures? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:07:36
This'll be a hard lesson to learn

Omg someone get the pitchforks cuz this guy's clearly against Bitcoins. Jokes aside, I'm amazed at how many posts are created daily here saying "I'm 19, new to investing, but I just spent my life savings to purchase 0.45 Bitcoin, what do I do now?". This bubble is going to affect so many people and it's going to be crazy how many more homeless it will create. "I just mortgaged my house and bought Bitcoin... HODL!!!". The first investing lesson is usually the hardest and it's "nothing comes for free".

Futures open, price goes up to $20,000-25,000. Contracts expire, new contracts target sub $10,000 and it goes ~$5600. Rinse and repeat and we end up around $7800 6/10/18.

Working as intended, can't hurt to email support but tough luck

Processing is based on fees. If yours is low priority 24h is normal

I'm so glad you're smug about it. Be smug about it to the bank with your nonexistent money 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:36:14
Sorry, it's actually working as intended. ToS is there for a reason. This is what a unregulated market is like

Just curious, but what stops a bitcoin core developer from injecting his own wallet with coins? I mean, they can probably do that without a trace right? They can probably do anything they want with their own development. Who stops them from doing this and what are the counter measures to deal with this? Adding 100 bitcoins out of no where and then selling it and cashing out. It just seems to me like BTC came out of no where and the developers are the one raking in the cash endlessly.

Thanks for that informed post!

Bitcoin is not backed by anything like cash is backed by gold. If, and when, bitcoin does crash, it will hold no significant value other than the value of convenience. If, and when, someone gets into your account and takes your bitcoins, you are completely shit out of luck. Bitcoin is, and should not be, something that over values precious metals.

Ya, fuck you coinbase for not having enough! You sound like a retard.
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:24:40
Do some research before you post. Thanks.

I'm glad there are no problems with transferring bitcoins. These bitcoin videos really sold that idea, so you must be lying.
