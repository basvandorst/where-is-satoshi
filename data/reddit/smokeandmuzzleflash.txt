You’re right. Are there any ways I can avoid the fees? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:12:22
Thank you. Is there one you’d personally recommend before I go off and search around for one? 
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:07:29
Is that just a matter of chance or are there ways to predict to some extent? 
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:04:10
Yeah I don’t know why I’m worried about it when I plan to be in this long term, just mainly curiosity I guess

Like many others I’m new to this. How would we be $3000 richer from this?
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:35:39
Yeah that makes sense. Are there any pointers to when we are going to see it bouncing up and down like that again

Let’s say i’m holding my bitcoin on coinbase (for the time being), would this be added to what I own or would I have to change it to bitcoin from the forked coins? I may be way off on this I’d just like to make sure I’d be able to take advantage of a potential opportunity like that

Thanks for the help, I’ll check it out.
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:24:21
Appreciate it, thank you.

It’s converting currency isn’t it?

Are there any tutorials you could recommend for that online, or what should I search to get some more information? I honestly just bought in for the first time a couple days ago and I’d like to learn as much as possible

Alright thanks, just a little anxious for the first time

My current computer has had some issues in the past with pop-up ads and corrupted data etc. It would be a better idea to get a fresh computer before transferring to secure wallets, right? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:17:32
Thank you!

Cool looks like it went through. Is there anything that determines wha the limit is, by the way?
