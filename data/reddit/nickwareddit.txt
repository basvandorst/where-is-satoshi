If I see another one of these threads today...
Buy low, sell high.  What is low and high is completely and utterly up to you.
@_date: 2013-04-17 16:16:42
I am very happy with it but as mentioned, not much volume most of the time.  Easy to deposit funds with EMT though!
@_date: 2013-04-19 00:01:55
$121 big on LibertyBit.  Smart me sold out at $101.

51% opens up some possibilities for sure...
An attacker that controls more than 50% of the network's computing power can, for the time that he is in control, exclude and modify the ordering of transactions. This allows him to:
* Reverse transactions that he sends while he's in control. This has the potential to double-spend transactions that previously had already been seen in the block chain.
* Prevent some or all transactions from gaining any confirmations
* Prevent some or all other miners from mining any valid blocks

Certainly looks better than yesterday.

You don't have to have an account at BMO or Scotia.  You bring CASH to one of them and deposit it into the bank accounts that they provide on their site.  After that, it is deposited to your account.  Read the info on the site, you add some $x.y0 amount to your deposit that signifies the last 2 digits in your Cavirtex account number...
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:10:41
They can, its call arbitration...
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:21:32
Pretty cool if it is actually legit.
@_date: 2013-04-14 23:30:25
Could he not transfer small amounts to LOTS of different wallets and cash out over different time intervals at different exchanges?  Only a fool would cash out 50,000 Bitcoin in 1 transaction.
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:30:36
So you have used EMT succesfully with them? I am about to do it now.  I just want to throw $100 in the account so I am ready to buy 1 or a couple in the next couple days when I see the opportunity.
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:47:43
Thanks for the information, I just started threw in $100 so I should be ready within 24 hours and will be watching for a good chance to buy.
@_date: 2013-04-16 12:37:18
Anyone going to give it a go with real BTC?
@_date: 2013-04-16 15:37:30
I'm in Canada and I do my bidding on LibertyBit.  Low volume so it can take a bit for the price to reflect Mt Gox or other large exchanges but I am doing good so far.
@_date: 2013-04-15 14:53:50
If they want to talk about .onion, maybe they should focus on the CP and other illicit things.  That stuff is nothing new.
@_date: 2013-04-11 13:48:56
Yes it appears things are sinking a bit still today, I am not sure what you foresee being a kickstarter to some big climb.  Unless you think people will start buying in ~$100 and drive the price up but then I would hope you are one of them if you expect to make anything in the short.
@_date: 2013-04-19 00:47:58
I wonder if CaVirtex is any better? I could move some BTC over there to play with...
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:24:25
I will not dignify this by saying 148
@_date: 2013-04-15 13:38:42
Don't know, maybe you could ask one of the other 14423 people who have been asking this over the weekend?
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:00:08
How long have you been "watching the markets"? Considering the price up until mid-March wasn't even $50, and there have only been those fluctuations the last 2 days, I would say not very long.
To answer your question though, yes, you can buy at 110 and sell at 160 every day to turn a profit - called day trading...
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:20:20
Looking a bit closer, it appears that there are a few different models there.
Considering this:
"Pre-order Terms: Bitforce SC (ASIC) products are in final stage development with initial shipping scheduled for the last half of April 2013. Products are shipped according to placement in the order queue, and delivery may take 2 months or more after order. All sales are final."
These could be the prototypes/test rigs/developers starting early :)
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:53:18
I just sent in around that to them too so I will be watching very closely the next few days...
@_date: 2013-04-15 14:51:40
I was hoping for some action too. I only have 1 BTC to play with and 1 to sit on for potential future purchases, but the excitement last week was great.
But, lack of volatility and steady prices are better for Bitcoin in the long run.
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:09:36
Oh I can only imagine.
@_date: 2013-04-18 17:59:00
Yeah, I suppose I should have waited for everyone to wake up.  I sold at $94.00 earlier this morning then not long after there was a big up and selling for $103.00.
Oh well, I've got my BTC sitting in cold storage now and cashed out my initial investment I bought to trade with.  The money I have left in my LB account is profit I've made in the past week so I can trade without as much worry now!
@_date: 2013-04-18 12:36:57
Working fine for me. 8:36 AM EST
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:10:14
Do you guys use the EMT option? I want to fund my account ASAP and this would be the quickest way..
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:25:11
Do not understand, some further explanation warranted.
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:20:07
I did this yesterday and have been told by others its right around 24 hours and it will be in my account there.
@_date: 2013-04-17 19:39:55
Yes to the 6 confirmations thing.  I go to blockchain.info, put in the address of the wallet you are transferring to at MtGox and watch the confirmations.
@_date: 2013-04-17 16:03:01
Buy low on 1 exchange, move to another, wait for transaction to clear 1-2 hours usually, sell higher, sit on funds for a bit, buy more BTC then you originally transfered when the price drops, move back to first exchange.  Of course, that takes time and lots of fluctuations in the market.
@_date: 2013-04-16 19:31:19
I was reading another post yesterday about "what would happen if all the Avalon ASIC were coded so that they would become the 51+%"? 
It is a bit conspiracy-theorish, but on the other hand, if they are the only ASIC operating, they would overpower the GPU and FPGA miners in a short time.  
I like to believe there is no malicious code within them though.
@_date: 2013-04-18 15:38:31
Perfect, thanks my friend.

I don't know why we're talking about SD anyways.  There is absolutely no point to throw money at SD and let it come back to the same wallet save for if you want to lose some.
Use a mixing service, distribute to a bunch of new wallets each time.  Yes there is always the problem of going from exchange -&gt; bank but in Canada at least, we can receive funds by e-mail money transfer (make a whole bunch of different emails) or by cheque.  I believe there are also store fronts where cash exchange can happen.
@_date: 2013-04-17 19:43:53
Except for Satoshi dice is fully traceable.  They could go back to Satoshi dice and see whether you actually won anything or not.  Throw into a mixing service and divide into a lot of small wallets.  Obviously one would have to cash out slowly.
At the same time, if "Satoshi" used the mixing service, cashed out 30,000,000 (for example) and paid his capital gains (assuming he had some), what issues would he face? He could have been early adopter and not necessarily, the "one".
@_date: 2013-04-24 14:48:53
If there is a buyer willing to pay what you are asking then the trade happens.  I was trading on MtGox for a bit but the fees are ridiculous. I am on LibertyBit now (I'm Canadian) and will take the lower volume for the 0.5% fees.
Right now LibertyBit is trading at 190 CAD / BTC.
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:13:18
@_date: 2013-04-18 14:42:19
You are correct but it doesn't move quick enough unless Gox jumps big then people buy/sell.
I would love to be able to sell right now but the bid is $89 while Gox is trading close to $94.  Last week all of LB was trading ~$10 higher than Gox...
@_date: 2013-04-18 13:21:48
Yeah same here, EMT was fast and easy.  Also EMT to withdrawl for only $2 fee is nice as well.
I am up 38% on the week just from day trading so I can't complain too much.  I also like the UI and everything is very easy to use/execute.  Just wish there was more volume and more people buying/selling so it would be easier to buy/sell at MtGox prices.
That being said, I did move some BTC to MtGox yesterday and traded a bit there.  You can do that for free if you want to. "Withdrawl" from LB to MtGox account wallet.  Trade.  Make profit and buy more BTC then you originally had then "withdrawl" from MtGox back to LB.
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:54:36
Same here, and I only have $100 in.  But, I am learning A LOT about markets and finance and Bitcoin!
@_date: 2013-04-15 14:55:33
I can't see a massive shift from Gold to Bitcoin as Gold will have always have some value whereas Bitcoin could go to 0.01 / BTC tomorrow leaving all those who dumped Gold with nothing.
@_date: 2013-04-17 19:45:39
Speaking to this, are there any apps for this available yet?  There was a guy looking for smartphone app ideas earlier, perhaps this could be a good idea.  
Within the app, have link available to your chosen exchange to quickly jump on price fluctuation if you don't have standing orders already...
Edit: ...and yes I am suffering from it too.  I worry that the price will flatten out (better for Bitcoin in general) and I will have missed any opportunities.  That being said, I am only working with an initial investment of $100 so it's more of the thrill than anything.
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:26:27
25 &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; 1500, if they have pre-orders on them at 1500 they better crank em up!
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:54:52
I also have $100 to play with.  I am not looking to make a quick profit but at the same time, would like to buy in low.   I will probably take keep an eye on it over the weekend and be ready to buy anytime after that.  At least after a few days I can count more on the price being steady or at least more so than now.  
Even reading after reading all day I am still unsure whether it will fall further or slowly rise!
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:19:57
I am behind the game already but planning to buy small amount now.  Not sure if should grab at 220 or wait a few days? Decisions are no fun.
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:22:33
Lower trading volume at smaller exchanges (in my view).
@_date: 2013-04-18 12:40:52
I don't think mining and owning/buying/using BTC are synonymous.  I am very interested in (and own) BTC and have absolutely zero desire to mine, think about mining, or care about others who are mining.  I think this is the general approach most people have and will take. 
@_date: 2013-04-18 01:21:35
Insufficient funds on other exchanges lead to a $40 penalty fee.  Same concept as a bounced check.
@_date: 2013-04-19 12:17:54
It's due to the Boston stuff going on.  Reddit has been up and down for the past few hours due to the multiple threads keeping up to the minute info from radio scanners, etc.  I guarantee its not an r/Bitcoin targeted DDOS.
@_date: 2013-04-15 13:40:58
Yeah perhaps OP (or OP bosses/higher up informants) are misinformed/confused.  No way they would implement Bitcoin when Amazon Coin is just about to be put into circulation.
@_date: 2013-04-13 21:02:54
I bought (on Libertybit) at $120 yesterday during the run up and sold for $146.  Prices were about $15 higher than MtGox at the time but still nice to come out ahead.  
I am using half the money I put in for trading and the other half to buy bitcoins for purchases/tipping.  Great way to use up my time!
@_date: 2013-04-24 15:51:11
Ok, not sure, I created my account about 3 weeks ago with no issues.  I went here first because they accept email money transfer for depositing and it was in my account with 24 hours.   Also for withdrawing funds, they send an EMT back to me, again, in my bank within 24 hours. 
You could always use CaVirtex and deposit at BMO.  Once account is funded, buy some BTC at a good price and transfer them to any other exchange for no fee.
@_date: 2013-04-25 14:42:54
I came in to say the same thing.  Best stability I have seen is the ~10$ fluctuation in the past 12 hours...
@_date: 2013-04-15 15:06:37
Well it has been pretty steady around $100 for the past 3 days but it is absolutely IMPOSSIBLE to know.  If someone could tell you whether the price would go up or down, they would be insanely rich already.  Analyzing the Bitcoin market is more difficult than analyzing the NASDAQ and that is near impossible in itself.
@_date: 2013-04-15 15:47:56
In my opinion, I think everyone bought in around 70-120 and are waiting for another bubble to make a quick buck. However, with all the speculators doing that, nothing will happen save for the price going down as people get bored.  It's almost unfortunate that the bubble happened as many people are now waiting for it to happen again as opposed to using Bitcoin as a currency.
However, there is A LOT of media attention and many more businesses accepting BTC now after last week so hopefully that will work to our (Bitcoin users/investors/believers) advantage.
@_date: 2013-04-18 11:33:48
Why did you ask the question if you were going to answer it yourself?
@_date: 2013-04-17 11:32:51
Couldn't he split up his coins into a bunch of different wallets then use a mixing service to shuffle his coins and have them deposited to a different wallet again? That way there is no link from Satoshi's wallet -&gt; new wallet 1 -&gt; mixing service !-&gt;! new wallet 2 -&gt; exchange...
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:52:38
Short selling at its finest!
@_date: 2013-04-15 14:56:08
But did he perhaps misunderstand? That's all I am trying to say.
@_date: 2013-04-24 18:57:59
I am on LibertyBit and the prices don't follow MtGox perfectly and there isn't much volume.
That being said, it is not LibertyBit's fault and I don't know how you can be "frustrated" with them because of it.
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:05:08
Basically.  The USD can be divided into $x..x.xx down to 2 decimal places.  Nothing smaller than a cent.  With bitcoins, one can go down to x...x.xxxxxxxx.  What that 0.00000001 is worth is determined by the exchange...
@_date: 2013-04-16 11:51:25
Looks good, maybe I am being optimistic but I would think you can come out on top more than not.  Hit the first line or two and cash out every time...?
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:17:10
Its the 1500 GH/s miners
Edit: At least 10k GH/s there, must be minting some coins
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:03:24
I'm still trying to buy in.  Want to get 2 BTC; one to be used for buying things and one to sit on for long term.  Having troubles getting it done with no bank in my small town (specifically the one I need to make deposit at for caVirtex).
@_date: 2013-04-17 16:01:28
Same here, I moved some BTC to play with on MtGox because there was more volume but back to LB I go now.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:41:48
Hope you are joking and didn't "buy high and sell low"...
