I think the majority of the blame for the over consumption we have now is not on the middle class. Rather consumption has been incentivized and propogandized by those in power throughout the years. A great example is how  manipulated public opinion into making it ‘respectable and uplifting’ for women to smoke when it was previously taboo.

You know capitalism isn't all bad. It harnesses greed and selfishness and incentivizes people to produce value. 
The bad part is that the financial system we currently have lacks any meaningful consequence for irresponsible greed by those in power. That's why the sub prime mortgage crisis, money laundering from big banks, war on drugs, and other atrocities are seen as just part of 'doing business'.
I've seen many arguments against this inhuman greed dismissed as 'commie smypathizing' or 'socialism', etc.
This binary choice is a falsity and I believe that capitalism can certainly exist alongside commonsense socialistic principles that look out for the common man. In fact it even happened here in the US after the New Deal.

This is a simplistic view IMO. Take for example any cable provider - Comcast / TimeWarner / Cox.
The business is quite frankly terrible but they are allowed to thrive and effectively monopolize. Govt enforcing laws that prevent such cartelization is in principle a defense of a free-er market.

I agree. However i dont think there's a 'free market' in reality. Theoretically yes. Practicaly it's the govt's job to keep the markets as free as possible

Let's wait till real climate change comes knocking. We can thank unfettered / myopic capitalism for it :)

Any high level details maybe?

I dont think it’s anything to do with being PC- rather it’s an ad hominem attack that’s irrelevant to the topic being discussed and more of a crude distraction

This wont be happening anytime soon. Bitcoin is still too volatile for but could be a possibility in 10-15 years?
