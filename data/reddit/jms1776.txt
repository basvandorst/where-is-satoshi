I have also had a similar issue with Gemini.  I set up an account on June 13, 2017 and initially sent $3,500 in funds from an account at Bank of America that I had not set up with Gemini.  I subsequently sent the same amount from the correct account which Gemini received and credited to my account.  They then sent me an email indicating that they received funds from a bank account that was not set up with them (see email below) and asked me to either set the account up or request the funds to be returned.  I asked the funds to be returned on 6/13/17 and have been asking via email for the same action every day.  The only response that I have received is an automated email acknowledging that they received an email from me.
Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
Hi There,
We received your wire of $3,500 from your bank account ending in 6269, however, the bank account you have registered to your Gemini account ends in 3414. Please clarify the difference in accounts. Sometimes bank use an intermediary bank that uses a reference number. Or you might need to register your bank account ending in 6269, otherwise, we will have to, unfortunately, return your funds. Please advise.
You can add an additional bank account to your Gemini account by navigating to the Bank Settings page (via the dropdown from the "user" icon located in the upper-right corner of the dashboard). Once there, select the "Add Bank Account" button in the center of the screen. You can verify your bank account instantly using your bank account login credentials.
Let me know if you have any additional questions!
Onward and upward
