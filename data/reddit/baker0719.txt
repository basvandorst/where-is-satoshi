Link to podcast, have a friend who loves joe but I’ve been trying to get him into bitcoin since 5k and always like nah it’s a bubble and will crash to 0
@_date: 2017-08-01 00:23:08
Yeah I wouldn't know about that, just have my coin stored on electrum soon to get a trezor
@_date: 2017-08-07 15:53:59
Prefer ledger over trezor?
@_date: 2017-08-08 15:58:50
electrum is great, just purchased myself a ledger nano S from there site heard great things about it, unfortunately doesn't ship till 9/15 due to demand.
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:28:19
Yeah that’s all he wants and $400 to be in it to activate it as a mining wallet. I just don’t understand I kept calling it a scam but idk how it could be. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:47:23
Where do you see that?
@_date: 2017-11-02 10:26:03
Well I’m not trying to spend any of my coins. Just I know electron cane out and it mirrored how many btc I had in my electrum wallet and gave me same amount for BCH.
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:57:26
I just didn’t understand why it was so much last night when I wanted to transfer to my hard wallet from electrum. I never changed the transaction fee and noticed it was pretty high and when I check btc to usd was like $250. Just seems to be odd when your telling me it should be 1.50
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:39:55
Loading them with bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-02 10:43:48
Might be a stupid question. There is a different Key put wallet address right? Cause I bought my btc at random times and stores across multiple wallet address on electrum.
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:17:21
Think be safe to go to previous downloads and download the old file?
No way of messaging them from there site? I sent them a tweet on twitter, then see multiple people have done the same thing as well.
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:43:12
Idk how cause when I went to send the rest of my btc to ledger the middle of the transaction bar was set up for ~ $250 fee to transfer in like 3-4 blocks I believe it was. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:45:13
Okay! I know I have my set as just BTC and not mbtc. 
Thanks 
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:21:39
Backup wallet file, like my seed?
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:22:01
Gotchu! Thank you, so I can just have them safely on electrum and wait till the fork and should be able to get the B2X. Hopefully they drop one for BTG as well.
@_date: 2017-11-08 01:30:14
Coinbase is cheap, stay anonymous try Localbitcoin cash deposit 
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:31:39
Know idea who this is, I just had no idea if this was true or not lol. Random dude who messaged me on Instagram and both following few btc/cypto pages 
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:22:16
What I was thinking but what could he do with the wallet since he doesn’t even control it, what I don’t understand
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:11:03
I downloaded the Windows installer on 
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:05:35
AVG protection. How is that a great sign?
@_date: 2017-11-04 15:58:05
I downloaded from the electrum website
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:29:16
Yeah I didn't want my wallet or coins to be compromised, would shit my pants if they disappeared..
-- also probably need to update my windows since running old software just hate to do so lol
Thanks hopefully news comes out saying false positive
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:26:04
Yeah I have my seed, and my wallet name popped up as well after i installed 2.9.3 version. I reinstalled it and ran the file and got this. probably correct about false positive...
@_date: 2017-11-08 01:35:56
well yeah i know that i was just wondering what time frame it would be locked in. So not to late for me to purchase more and still get the same amount in b2x as btc
@_date: 2017-11-04 18:52:31
How do you like breadwallet? I keep my coins on electrum/Nano S but would like to use breadwallet for payments when I go to stores that accept btc on backing packing trip
@_date: 2017-11-17 22:01:39
 I tried to move my coins to bittex and my ledger would says cannot send 
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:41:56
I was adjusting it on electrum and the lowest was still 100+. How would I consolidate to segwit? And why
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:11:42
I have one but coins on both..
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:45:23
So just wait for the pending transaction fee period to drop and should be relatively cheaper to send?
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:00:07


@_date: 2017-11-16 18:36:01
No way I was spending about 2k monthly about few months ago and was like way low than that. Only taking less than $20 out 
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:01:37
Where can I get a billion dollar bill?!
@_date: 2017-11-04 15:58:33
@_date: 2017-11-04 18:37:33
I don’t see where they posted anything about the error being a false positive, oh damn that’s like 78k usd. I have like 1/3 of that stored on electrum and other on hard wallet. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 10:22:15
Just trying to take advantage of getting B2X. I just got email saying coinbase will match your BTC value you have but don’t like to store my coins on exchange obviously.
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:40:09
Cool! So I would want to do my transfer during a drop in the transaction meme pool?
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:55:21
How would I do the segwit if I’m on electrum?
@_date: 2017-10-24 15:19:19
Why you say that?
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:30:58
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:41:24
Oh I’ve been refreshing the page and still am. Nothing appeared yet
@_date: 2017-10-24 15:22:09
Well glad it was a small amount compared to my normal wallet
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:20:04
I just tried to send .1 btc to my wallet and 2hrs nothing on blockchain fml
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:25:29
Yeah I copy and pasted and tripled checked just now. Just read stuff you shouldn’t move coins around fee days prior to a fork. Fingers crossed 
@_date: 2017-10-17 20:22:53
Thanks for the info!! So if I move my btc from electrum wallet say 1.1btc to the btc cash wallet it will be on there then move it back off btc cash to the btc wallet.
Would you recommend doing a test run of like $100 from my btc wallet to the Btc cash wallet and then move back to see if I got hang of it.
Sorry for 20 questions, just don’t want to lose my btc lol
@_date: 2017-10-17 19:43:25
Okay I have them stored on a ledger right now, so I can do it after the hard fork? And not rely on a website to do the mirror of getting bitcoin gold from the amount of btc I have in my wallet.
*** am I still able to do so with btc cash??
@_date: 2017-10-23 23:57:39
Im close to 4hrs ago and still yet to have anything appear on blockchain
@_date: 2017-10-17 19:53:59
Okay I have some on there and electrum, does that go for that as well?
@_date: 2017-10-17 20:50:08
What’s electron? Move them from my electrum wallet to another new wallet, as in what? I can just say send my 1btc from electrum wallet to the bitcoin cash electrum?
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:41:58
Does electrum do the same anyone know?
@_date: 2017-10-17 20:01:50
Okay I need to look into that so I get my btc cash off my electrum wallet. Know anything about electrum?
@_date: 2017-10-17 20:59:04
So do I still need to download this,  Thought that would generate me a bitcoin cash wallet to do so. 
Sorry very new to all this stuff and literally thought I missed out on bitcoin cash. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:20:02
Now past that point ����
@_date: 2017-10-24 14:42:05
yeah 13hrs and finally arrived.. thankfully
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:41:08
B2X available if stored btc in electrum?
@_date: 2017-10-17 19:39:02
What site do you use to get your bitcoin gold? I missed out on bitcoin cash just being skeptical about moving my coin
@_date: 2017-10-17 22:32:00
Okay so I can use that to get my BCH from my btc. Why would you recommend to use electron 
@_date: 2017-07-31 18:30:31
Thank you for your help!! 
@_date: 2017-07-13 19:27:07
Coins safe in electrum right?
@_date: 2017-07-21 15:16:43
What happens in November 
@_date: 2017-07-31 18:46:36
Okay would you suggest trezor or ledger, any preference? 
@_date: 2017-07-31 18:07:01
BTC key as in personal key for electrum? So I have my BTC on say Wallet A, need to make another electrum wallet with the same personal key for Wallet B? So BTC will stay on Wallet A and the BCC on Wallet B? 
Sorry just confused 
@_date: 2017-07-31 18:20:53
Okay thank you, so on electrum, when I create a new wallet and copy everything over how do I make it a BCC wallet? Or will it so it automatically? 
@_date: 2017-07-31 18:53:29
Appreciate it will look into :)
@_date: 2017-07-31 18:36:18
I was looking into a trezor, but I was reading trezor2 is soon to come out, should I wait till that one? Also have few ETH and LTC
@_date: 2017-07-31 18:58:56
Oh yeah I have definitely do that. Have my electrum on paper and memorized. Greatly appreciate all the help
@_date: 2017-07-31 18:30:02
Nah I wasn't planning on using BCC, just have BTC as investment years ago. Was just seeing if I should get BCC to have both coins available. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 19:01:18
Also trezor on Amazon are $200 would you suggest just getting from them directly from EU for $89? And pay for the express shipping 
@_date: 2017-07-31 18:27:42
So probably be wise to just leave my btc in Electrum? And hold out till they get BCC? Sorry all this is just confusing coming back to and figuring it out on the last day
@_date: 2017-07-31 18:25:37
Okay you for the help, any suggestions on a BCC ready wallet? Would you suggest moving coins from electrum to that wallet to get the BCC
