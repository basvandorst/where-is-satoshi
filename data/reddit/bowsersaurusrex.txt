It depends on how fast the security is broken. If it's broken too fast, the dev team won't have time to react, and it will bottom out. If it's broken too slowly, debate will arise, and there won't be a clean fork.
@_date: 2019-07-14 00:19:01
Unless future computers can break its security.
@_date: 2019-07-12 03:00:30
OK, but enough about the US Dollar, what do you think of Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-07-29 15:58:16
LOL, this is such garbage. It shows wireless flaws. The whole point of wires is that you can touch it and actually weigh it, therefore it's not comparable with a invisible super unstable wireless that gets tons of bottleneck problems at higher use...
You just sound like an old man yelling at technology.

Unfortunately, if it reaches 1 million, a Satoshi will be pushing 1 cent, which will start to be an issue.
@_date: 2019-11-28 18:43:33
Ehe, other cryptos make a better currency than Bitcoin. Bitcoin's more valuable on a larger scale than day to day transactions.
@_date: 2019-03-18 20:08:36
You hold the cash yourself. Mind you, I use *bank* and they certainly don't charge $3 or anywhere near it for a withdrawal.
Still not seeing the difference.
@_date: 2019-03-18 14:44:56
I'm just illustrating that you can say the exact same thing about Bitcoin, and thus the original post is meaningless.
@_date: 2019-03-17 21:34:14
When Bitcoin charges you transaction fees to get your own money...
Then tells you to hide your private keys so you don't get robbed...
@_date: 2019-03-07 16:21:15
Divisibility is one of the 6 characteristics of money and if Bitcoin grows large enough to take over fiat, it won't have enough divisibility to be a viable currency.
Edit: Personally, I think that Bitcoin replacing all currency is extremely unlikely, so in practice it's a non-issue.
@_date: 2019-03-19 02:07:15
And third parties never hold people's Bitcoin? Exchanges are a thing.
@_date: 2019-03-15 15:04:58
My favorite food truck just started taking Nano and offers a slight discount because there's no credit card fees.
@_date: 2019-03-07 16:58:29
@_date: 2019-03-18 18:42:22
If someone is holding your fiat and you want it transferred to you so you can hold it, you pay a fee.
If someone is holding your Bitcoin and you want it transferred to you so you can hold it, you pay a fee.
I'm not seeing the difference.

The oldest millennials are turning 40 in a few years.

I think the elephant in the room with Bitcoin is power consumption. It's just going to get more and more power hungry. Meanwhile, the world is slowly feeling the effects of climate change. Meanwhile, "green" alts exist and, from a consumers perspective, are no different in functionality.
@_date: 2019-10-02 18:50:41
OK, even if I take that one article as absolute scientific proof that it's "more secure" (as if "secure" is a quantifiable measurement), you asserted that it was more secure than every other crypto and always will be, so I would expect an article for every crypto out there and a full analysis of how it performs better against quantum computing.
Edit: Also, this was a discussion of cryptos that don't use mining, and you posted an article about Ethereum.
@_date: 2019-10-01 21:54:15
Bitcoin being more secure than every other crypto isn't a scientifically proven fact. Stop acting like it is.
@_date: 2019-10-02 18:56:21
A 51% attack is based on the distribution of hash power, not hash rate, and Bitcoin's hash power distribution isn't great.
In addition, if your assertion is that Bitcoin is the most secure because it is the most widely used, then that is independent of the underlying technology and could apply to any crypto that holds that position.
Cryptos that don't use mining are independent of centralized cryptos. That's a false correlation.
@_date: 2019-10-01 17:22:53
In addition, when Bitcoin rises, so does everything else. Granted, many alts will eventually die off, but when it's all said and done, it's extremely unlikely that Bitcoin will be alone.
@_date: 2019-10-01 17:25:26
If things get so bad that the global economy bottoms out, the chance of you still having an internet service provider is pretty much zero.
@_date: 2019-02-22 19:51:01
Well, unless you know something I don't, so is a million dollars.
@_date: 2019-10-01 19:05:50
\&gt;  There are no "green" alts with the same security as Bitcoin. 
That's a matter of opinion, and a matter that the average consumer won't care about if it's "secure enough" and the planet is dying.
@_date: 2019-02-22 20:01:54
Wait, I'm allowed to print USD? Fuck, no wonder I'm poor.
@_date: 2019-02-22 19:49:04


Are you talking about the USD or gold?
@_date: 2019-12-12 16:31:38
It was also invented to be digital cash, not a store of value.
@_date: 2019-12-13 02:02:40
But it's already far too slow to be used as cash without layer 2 solutions.
Hash power being centralized in China. Lightning pushing people towards custodial funds. Bitcoin is becoming everything it was fighting against.
@_date: 2019-12-01 18:32:19
And that's when your average consumer will just say "Uhhh, I'll just use my credit card."
@_date: 2019-12-03 01:50:13
Then why did you make a Bcash ring?
@_date: 2018-11-19 05:24:41
How this saying is supposed to be read: Nothing is certain.
How this saying is usually read: Don't learn from the past.

What people forget is that even though the data is in Pi, the index is probably larger than the data itself.
@_date: 2018-02-17 01:21:40
So you think that the government is going to build a decentralized computing platform like Ethereum?
Are we going to have a government sanctioned programming language?
Are they going to have government sanctioned versions of the more esoteric systems? Social Media? Publishing? App Stores? Advertising? Storage sharing? Auctions? Gaming? Messaging? Ride sharing? Crowdfunding?
These decentralized systems all require their own crypto to function, and that's what most people don't seem to understand about the technology.
The government isn't going to suddenly start taking over every industry that could be disrupted by crypto.
@_date: 2019-09-03 15:43:46
You honestly believe that governments have secret algorithms to undo most encryption?
@_date: 2019-09-03 18:08:54
And the only people who noticed these flaws, somehow, magically, all work for the government.
@_date: 2019-09-03 17:53:04


*The US government enters the chat*
@_date: 2019-09-03 17:19:59
There's people all over the world researching encryption. For this to make sense, every single one of those people would need to be wasting their time and completely incompetent.
@_date: 2019-09-03 18:06:48
And it would require everyone who studies encryption in any capacity to secretly be in cahoots with each other, conspiring together, without a single leak, for the betterment of multiple governments who totally get along in this scenario. Pure lunacy.
@_date: 2019-09-03 17:21:36
No, because it absurd. It's like believing the Earth is flat.
@_date: 2018-04-06 22:24:38
You remind me of those people who said the internet was a fad.
@_date: 2018-04-07 21:58:01
That's an incredible display of critical thought. /s
It's a breakthrough internet technology that solves major real world problems regarding distributed consensus and the allocation of finite resources. It's not going to just go away.
@_date: 2018-04-07 14:03:45
As a developer working in silicon valley during the late 90's and early 2000's I can tell you that a lot of companies insisted that the internet was a fad. You just need to look at companies like Blockbuster to know it's true.
At it's core, cryptocurrency is a networking technology for decentralied consensus and resource allocation. It's the TCP/IP of monetary value. It's a technology that will fundamentally change the way in which we conduct business.
People who share your opinion will be running the next Blockbuster into the ground.
@_date: 2019-05-19 19:08:22
Yeah, that might be true. If Bitcoin ever becomes a global currency, we're probably going to be wishing there were a few more decimal points.
@_date: 2019-05-21 20:45:48
"Do a smart contact."
@_date: 2019-05-19 18:46:12
If it reaches $1B, each Satoshi will be worth $10, making it effectively useless as a currency.
@_date: 2019-05-21 23:20:40
There's a reason people don't build smart contract applications on Bitcoin.


Nano isn't centralized and it has zero transaction fees.
@_date: 2019-05-30 03:20:32
I've always wondered why this didn't happen in actual battles.
@_date: 2019-05-21 23:25:14
You should warn all the major software companies who are building on these platforms that they don't know what they're doing. They clearly know less than you do.
@_date: 2019-05-21 17:30:08
Smart contracts.
Zero transaction fees.
@_date: 2019-05-21 17:28:57
So smart contracts will be abandoned for the sake of having just one? You better hope there's more than just one, because if there is just one it isn't going to be Bitcoin.
