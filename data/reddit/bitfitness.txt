Now that is risky!

It isn't new.  The US Marshalls auctioning off confiscated bitcoins did that already.

I don't see people blaming bitcoin.  And I vote no to giving any of these for profit organizations money because they were negligent with their IT.  That would be rewarding bad behavior.

Convenience and safety.  I know the safety part sounds weird to some but you probably don't cross borders.  It's like a personal bank account like any other but not insured.

I've had coins sitting in a BIP38 wallet on gmail since 2013 with no problems.  I do have copies elsewhere but this is my emergency coins for access from anywhere on earth.  Now that I think about it, I should probably redo this and break it into a smaller wallet and move the rest into cold storage.  I don't think I need 17k in emergency money.
We can't comment on probability(stupid or not) with you because there are too many unknowns on our end.

Look into BIP38 wallets, they are encrypted with a password but portable like a normal wallet.  If you use a really strong password it should be hard to defeat.  But if it was defeated that is also useful info.

If they aren't accepting and holding then they aren't 'interacting', someone like BitPay is.

That's nice, if you want to live in fantasy world where this would somehow make bitcoin balls legit and prevent all further bad regulations then fine, enjoy yourself.  I'll be enjoying reality where bitcoin is already 'legit'.

I would agree with you if the US Government planned to accept bitcoin and hold it.  But I really really doubt that is the case.  It is much more realistic that they would accept it as a payment method and convert immediately to USD.  So when you break it down, both cases are really just buying and selling bitcoin and not that different.  Wake me up when the US Government starts holding bitcoin.
