You're assumptions and name-calling is a negative to the community. Whether you lost money or not, act like you've been there before.

“Let me be clear, here’s the deal: Make no mistake that bitcoin is our future. A future that I promise is greater together. And greater with bitcoin leading the way,” he concluded.

I read this more like "Having trouble showing us the funds"
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:43:10
Yeah this is Bullshit. Proceed at your own risk, especially if devs are going to sit here and let another version of Bitcoin become king. Action must be taken and quickly and Blockstream realizes this.
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:39:58
My grandpa actually did this LOL.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:06:41
lol exactly. I'm not sure this "lightning" network is all it's said to be.. I felt the same way about Segwit.
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:41:42
gdax is owned by Coinbase but you need a separate account to login there. I would recommend signing up at the Gemini exchange and buying from them. Transaction fees are high at the moment, I would recommend accumulating on an exchange and moving a large amount at once. Fees are not proportional to the amount you send. In other words, sending 10$ and sending $1000 will result in the same fee. So by saving up on an exchange until you have 300+ or so, will ensure you don't get eaten alive by fees. Fees will hopefully decrease in the coming months. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:27:02
Sure thing, please go ahead and let us know who did it. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:43:59
The only way to know is to read the original white paper and decipher for yourself. Many people here disagree... however, with fees being so high to transact, you cannot necessarily blame them. Bitcoin is in the development process and when Bitcoin technology allows for scaling, there won't be a need to bcash anymore.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:02:14
Doing the same this afternoon. Gemini will have my weekly purchases from here on out.

This is definitely some pretty big news! There is a lot of money spent at APMEX each year.

Bitcoin is that LARGE of a player. Bitmain is the largest miner and Bitcoin is decentralized enough that many others are mining also. Bitmain started BCH and controls a large % of the hashrate.

Hmm interesting. I've followed Brian closely for a relatively small amount of time (3 months) and have seen him as a consistent voice of reason amongst the execs in the industry. That is just my opinion though
    
    
Either way, having an alternative, large sized exchange is a huge plus for the industry.

THIS is the problem with having a bunch of neckbeards in charge. Your number 1 priority is the code and making it perfect. At this point, its not about the code. You have a user problem, and a single line of code could fix that. Then you could go back to your neckbeard ways.     
      
Put your integrity behind you for 10 minutes and you could see that.

The blocksize limit is a single line of code. Yes, i am a softwear developer, no i have not worked with others strictly online.
   
    
My entire point is that bitcoin does not need a perfect solution today, in fact it might not need that block size increase today. What it does need is to show its users that it is willing to adapt and accept their concerns (which happens to be am update to a single line of code).
@_date: 2016-03-23 01:24:53


@_date: 2016-03-19 02:08:54
Ha, what? Really? What bad idea's do Classic have? And remember, most core developers don't disagree with a increase in block size, they just don't want it now.
@_date: 2016-03-17 23:27:07
My debit card works and my Discover card works. Since this is on the Chase side, I don't see why a card from a credit union wouldn't work. Chase is the only one I've heard of denying p2p transactions.

@_date: 2016-03-19 15:44:40
Nah  i completely agree with you. I'm not saying this is a long term solution. In fact, this would be about 90% used to "make the people happy", while the long term solution is in development. I just think a good leader balances between serving their customers and providing the optimal solution. Right now, it seems one side is fighting for the users and one is fighting for the optimal solution. 
    
Balance is key.    
    
Also, I've been a full stack developer for 3 years now for a local company. I still have a lot to learn, but i know enough to read and play around with the btc source code. I'm certainly not saying i have all the answers by the way.

Hey All,
I've been following Bitcoin for a few years now, but have just recently started paying closer attention and following the day-to-day.
The question I'm looking for opinions or supported facts on is this: With all of this new money coming into the crypto world this past week, where in the world is that money coming from?
Someone has to be out there buying BCH at $235 or it would be crashing, right?
Why are they buying? Or are exchanges taking some risks and stockpiling early, hoping it retains over time?
All opinions are encouraged and appreciated.
@_date: 2016-06-03 16:01:14

@_date: 2017-11-16 21:42:25
You can store the current price as a variable then write a function that compares the current price to the highest price you have seen. And if the current price is higher, then that becomes your "highest" price point.
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:40:43
Na this is nonsense. The people who own 90% of BCH don't care if you are still holding or not, they will take off with your Bitcoin when they are ready to take out their profits... Which is appearing to be a lot with all this social scamming.
@_date: 2017-11-14 02:26:08
Dude, you are missing my point here. This company I chose to use was out of necessity. People here said that was the best option.. AKA we are recommending the wrong software to people.. What wallet SHOULD we be using to select our own fees?
@_date: 2017-11-14 01:58:41
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:45:58
100% right. This is all a ploy.. I mean look at the team he's working with. We're talking about very rich people who can't go to certain countries because of their actions. These guys are frauds and this won't last. They are pumping and soon to be dumping these coins.
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:53:09

@_date: 2017-11-14 01:14:34

@_date: 2017-11-12 19:51:04
The public won't buy into this BCH nonsense.. They are barely buying into Bitcoin itself! Ha
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:03:54
Yeah, I'm with your best bet is to hard code the highest price up to date.
@_date: 2017-11-14 02:33:11
New people listen to advice from people here. That's why people are here.
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:04:43
Your argument took a left turn half way through that... Huge profits or finding a coin that works for you pal?
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:50:51
I agree, it's spam. But when I send Bitcoin from my phone (Mycelium), I don't get an option for choosing $0.0001. I get a minimum option of like 5 bucks. So how about now? Is the software the issue? I'm speaking from a users perspective, not one that understands how Bitcoin works completely.
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:08:15
Here's the api url for coinmarketcap: 
You have a couple options, your best is to grab the Bitcoin url from the above link and make a request to their server. Once you get the data back, set the current price to a variable. Then compare your all-time high price vs your variable price as outlined above.. Some programming skills will be required here.
@_date: 2017-11-15 00:40:30
No worries, it means some big names in the Bitcoin industry are passing their money back and forth from Bitcoin to Bitcoin Cash in somewhat oddly similar patterns.

@_date: 2017-11-21 18:44:03
LOL Fantastic
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:52:58
Yep, I assume that's why Roger and team are using this pump to steal people's hard earned Bitcoin.. So they have funds to buy BCH once Coinbase releases them.
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:45:35
Hard to say, probably a little bit.. But people moved money over to BCH also, so that's probably bringing it down a bit.
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:13:40
Currently true. Longterm false, the people moving you over are causing this. How don't you see this.
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:50:07
Nope, the pump is over. The dump is just beginning. This is where people get hurt.

I haven't seen an API that offers that functionality, but it might exist out there. You might have to do some exploring of the web, but there are all sorts of Bitcoin API options.
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:55:41
Bitcoin is better off without them.
@_date: 2017-11-14 02:41:53
Oh look, Mycelium is on the list. Back to the original problem. Good day sir.
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:40:42
Download Mycelium and move your coins there. Don't buy through Bitcoin.com or even associate with it.
@_date: 2017-11-14 02:32:41
Dude, people here recommend wallets that don't let you choose the fee. What wallet should I switch to so that I'm able to set my own fees? Because I have 3 options that all don't allow it currently.
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:03:08
Well, our software may eventually become obsolete.
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:32:14
True, I heard a rumor there's a potential bug in the code also that a particular set of devs are exploring.
@_date: 2017-11-15 00:19:31

Ah gotcha. Thanks, I didn't know that.
@_date: 2016-05-03 22:00:17
Where did Gavin say he may have been hoodwinked?     
   
I'll start by saying I do agree with you.. If Craig's intention is for the world to know that he is SN, then yes, signing the message is 100% the quickest and most efficient way to let the world know. He has made it clear that he is being "safe" about it though. If it's true and he is SN, he is sitting on hundreds of millions of dollars that every government in the world wants a share of.
    
But Craig is clearly anti-government and NEEDS to be safe about this. It is much easier to say "do it" than to be the guy on the other end who actually has to jump.

I would disagree, but I have no proof besides the people I have spoken to. I guess my rebuttal would ask: What is the advantage to using btc then?

BTCC is the company whose CEO wants regulation on BTC (Bitcoin).

Does the 95% have to maintain for the entire waiting period? Or is it a one time 95%?

People come to btc to avoid the fees... So the solution to scaling is to add additional fees?

Hahah I came here for advice, not criticism man. Looking to fix my problems, not get shit for my current mistakes.

Interesting... So im getting that I should NOT keep them on there. I agree with that.. my concern is if I keep them in a local wallet and my computer crashes, will they be gone?
@_date: 2016-05-27 20:38:45
I don't think they see it this way at all pal.
@_date: 2015-02-27 21:19:38
Thats the plan

Hi. Thanks for doing what your doing!

They get mined directly into my cex account is why they are there now.. Ill look into electrum though
@_date: 2016-07-05 21:16:09
So what's the solution? Don't leave on an exchange, don't leave on your phone wallet....Where are my btc safe?
@_date: 2017-06-09 15:25:35
@_date: 2016-05-09 20:52:42
The point is so that when they deploy the solution it doesn't blow up in everyones face... Testing, testing and more testing until all bugs are fixed.

Lol so they would know and understand the feeling? Maybe a lawsuit is in order?
@_date: 2016-05-27 20:53:11
I don't think their mindsets are as vastly different as you would think. I am both and talk on Reddit with both often.
@_date: 2015-02-27 20:10:34
Im going to do that this weekend. I appreciate you providing the extra details.
@_date: 2016-07-16 15:54:53
No, that's Japan.

Bullshit they don't. Paypal was the original "my account got locked and my money is stuck" company.. Although it does seem things have gotten better, or maybe it's because I'm a legit user with verified everything.

This. Read your terms and you'll understand it takes a few days to receive your coins. Being "pending" is perfectly normal on my purchases. When they cancel your order is when it becomes a problem
@_date: 2017-06-28 21:01:27
I don't get where the question comes into play? In your hypothetical, You get your money into the U.S and go on with your business. Where is the question?
@_date: 2016-07-05 20:13:12
I've been using Coinbase for a little over a year and I keep telling myself the day this happens I am jumping ship also.. I've already started to move bought coins elsewhere.
@_date: 2016-07-08 19:14:26
Or we can all keep clicking the links and make them lose money on the deal.
@_date: 2016-05-03 18:02:56
lol. I'm sure bitcoin created itself then.
