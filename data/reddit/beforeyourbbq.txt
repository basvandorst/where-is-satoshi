Whereas long means buying

Every time. Never reveal how much you have.

Done with Coinbase as soon as it's available.

Shorting also means selling.
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:31:40
I bought at $13, haven't sold at all. I think this makes all the difference. I'm not stressing but ppl who bought at 600-700-800-+ are losing it.

Wealth is weird. Wanted it all my life. Now I have some of it, I don't want anyone to know. My family knows, already Xmas and Thanksgiving were weird. 
Edit: spelling

Why do you love shorting BTC? Do you believe the price will never go higher than it is today?
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:29:24
Tell that to the last 5-6 times this has happened... every January.

I now use Gemini too. I left after BCH launched in CB and they locked trading.

I bought another grand just now. But we need more people to buy the dip.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:06:16
I'm kinda happy it's across the board. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:23:41
You're right. It's like this post showing the 5k to 3k drop is the same as the 20k to 12k: 
I feel like this is an opportunity for people to get in low and earn some profits. I love how BTC does this!

This is what a correction feels like. We had a rally, now the bears are in. Even it loses 50% it's only pushed back to last month's price.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:28:03
Go on. What say you, wise one? What do you know that we don't?
@_date: 2017-12-29 16:11:37
Unsophisticated retail investors are holding, but more importantly they're not buying the dip (BFD). Institutional money is shorting BTC. This causes a bear market. I think it's short lived.

What a shit website. 3 sentences followed by begging the user to click their ads.
@_date: 2019-10-26 01:10:06
Could you help me understand how to interpret this data?
Is it that nearly all of the *puts* have been called, yet there are still options out there for a lower price? Any way to tell how long those contracts have before they're called?

What impact do you think halving will have?

You can transfer your coins out of Robinhood to another wallet/address. You can also sell your coins for fiat on Robinhood.
However, you cannot deposit coins into Robinhood. You can only purchase them with fiat.

According to the IRS, BTC is property and subject to taxation. Flight miles are not. That's the difference.

They're doing a methodic, controlled roll out. That's actually good design/practice. Execution is vital. Unlike Coinbase who opens the flood-gates (remember BCH?) and shit hits the fan for everyone.

Enjoy paying capital gains tax on that transfer as well.

[Robinhood]( (the app that lets you buy stocks/etfs with zero-fees) is getting ready to launch a crypto app. Goodbye Coinbase.
@_date: 2018-02-03 15:13:23
To answer your question are you referring to Robinhood or Coinbase? Robinhood makes money off the interest earned from uninvested funds in a customer's account.
For example. If you deposit $500 and buy $400 worth of stock, they'll earn interest of the remaining $100 in your account. Also, any dividends paid will be added to your account balance - earning interest for them.

iPhone batteries must really sick. Everyone screenshot, low juice.

I get instant buys via ACH... 
@_date: 2018-02-04 03:27:04
After just learning Robinhood won't let you transfer coins INTO your account, I'll still Coinbase for the occasional crypto-to-fiat exchange. But I will 100% buy all future ETH and BTC through Robinhood. Then send from Robinhood to Bittrex or other exchange.

You'll still need to report it on your income tax. Even if it is a loss (ex: bought BTC at $12k, sold/traded/exchanged at $10k). You exchanged your BTC for a burrito, you pay capital gains tax on the difference of price when you bought the BTC and when you sold it to buy the burrito.
