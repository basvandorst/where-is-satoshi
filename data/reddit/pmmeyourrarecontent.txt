Yes, I got it from electrum.org. The original file I had was 3.3.2 and now I updated to 3.3.4, exactly same issue.
@_date: 2019-04-13 15:54:24
Yes, it's green. I also tried a different server. bitcoin.cluelessperson.com was the normal one and testnet.hsmiths.com gives the same results.

Haha thanks!

I tried activating the BIP39 seed option if that's what you mean, but if I do that, the checksum fails and it doesn't work.

Heh. Sorry man. The thing is, I use a Start menu manager thing where you can click on the app folder and it starts the app, but it misidentified the testnet thing as the main app (there's an automatism) and started that one instead of the normal one, and I only noticed the "testnet" in the title way later.

I was using 3.3.2 and as an attempt to fix the problem I updated to 3.3.4, but same problem remains, the new addresses do not match the old ones.
Edit: Can you tell me what you mean with that block explorer stuff? I only have a screenshot of the old addresses tab, that's all.
@_date: 2019-04-13 16:18:18
Yep, I was using testnet. Just realized it. I didn't know that was even a thing. My wallet is from what you call mainnet (normal one basically), that's why it wasn't able to open it. LOL
I'm a horse.

Okay, I actually found the address on blockchair.com and it shows the full amount I had. But that's not much use if I can't access it, right?

I chose Segwit (that was version 3.3.2) and the restoration does recognize the seed. When I change a single letter in the seed, it no longer recognizes it, so it must be correct, no? It doesn't give me an option to use a different seed type for restoration.
@_date: 2019-04-13 16:02:59
Yeah, Standard. I also still have the screenshots of the process I originally went through, so I know I chose standard back then as well.

Hahahahaha oh man ... listen, I have no idea why or what it means, but somehow I must have been using something called Electrum Testnet. No clue what that even is. But I restarted electrum, now noticing there is both "electrum testnet" and "electrum" and this time I started "Electrum" and suddenly it works.
God damn, what even is this! 
That's one hell of a relief tho.

I see. But I used words with the Segwit algorithm in 3.3.2. And I even verified them back when I created them by typing them back in. Plus, I actually have a screenshot of what the phrase was and I typed it back directly from there.
@_date: 2019-04-13 16:19:19
Well, because I had both the seed and the original wallet file. Seed was my normal attempt at restoring it. Wallet file was password protected and didn't open.
But yeah, turns out I was using the Testnet thingy and that's why it wouldn't open ... started normal version now and it finally works again. Thank God.
@_date: 2019-04-13 16:01:02
Scary stuff, but I don't remember anything like that happening.
@_date: 2019-04-13 16:06:30
I haven't. I have the screenshot of how I created the wallet with the original filename and a screenshot of the wallet with funds with the wallet open that has the same filename.
As mentioned in the original post, I also still have my wallet file and the password and apparently the password DOES get recognized, but it gives me an error message and refuses to load. (see OP)
@_date: 2019-04-13 15:46:10
It was version 3.3.2
Changing a single letter in the seed makes it invalid and not recognized, so I'm guessing its correct
@_date: 2019-04-13 15:46:18
Yes, with Electrum 3.3.2
@_date: 2019-04-13 16:12:18
Yep, I explicitly went on electrum.org to download it. The phrase of the error is exactly this:


Yes it shows 0. mBTC
Addresses shows addresses, but they are different from the original ones. Searching for the address I had with Ctrl+F gives no result. Coin tab is empty.
