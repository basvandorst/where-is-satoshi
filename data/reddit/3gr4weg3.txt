I made a youtube video on how to get around it&gt; 
I bought Fallout 3 new vegas for 2 USD with bitcoin in Australia

I tried selecting every rescan/ resync option, it doesnt finish/complete scanning/syncing
edit: wait wtf thats so weird, it didnt work at all last night but it did in the morning, im so confused..... I rebooted my I rebooted my phone 3 times as well... 
edit2: nope still have the same problem, it did work initially but if I lose my wifi connection and I try to reconnect it never syncs, so the wallet is unusable to me atm, is it possible to get a previous version? I couldnt find one anywhere. Oh and whenever I try to scan a qr code it takes a lot longer than it should with the normal (terrible focusing and using the flash light on my phone interferes with the scanning even though it clarifies the image) qr codescanner app.

Yes, you don't need to use a VPN to use bitcoin. HOWEVER, I needed to use the VPN to buy a game from GMG, if you noticed in the video at 4:09, GMG states: "Unfortunately this product is not yet available in your region. please check our FAQ for more details.", I had to use a VPN to change my location from Aus to USA since GMG only accepts bitcoin from US residents.
You don't actually need to enter a 'valid' US address either lol, as long as the information you input fits the number/letter criterior
