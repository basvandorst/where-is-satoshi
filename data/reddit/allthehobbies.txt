"Opportunity" was not the best word choice. Sure the information is available to everyone with Internet access. However men and women browse different websites. How do you know if the sites hosting Bitcoin articles are used equally by both genders?


Journalists and editorial authors are often assigned work by others, or pick work based on how hot a topic is. Who wrote the article doesn't imply interest either.


You are still operating under the assumption that both genders have been equally introduced to the topic. I still don't think attendance at one type of social event within a topic of interest implies any kind of level of general interest in the topic with one gender vs another.
Also, equal proportion at the first meetup? That is like saying if you had two coins, both with equal odds of landing tails, that they would both land on tails the first time you flipped them. Even if both genders had equal interest, that doesn't guarantee any sort of attendance at any one meetup. Maybe an average over hundreds or thousands of meetups over a geographically diverse area...
I'd be more likely to think that a lack of attendance by the female gender at those meetups would show a lack of interest in the meetups themselves rather than the topic of Bitcoin. That would still be a stretch with no real information to base that on.
Heck, I'm a man, very interested in Bitcoin and I have no interest at all in attending Bitcoin meetups in physicality.
Again I'm not saying Females are less or more interested in Bitcoin than Males. I'm saying there is not enough data yet to know. I felt you were making wild assumptions, just like the guys described in the article appeared to be.

Bitcoin is not a consumer level payment method, it is just the protocol driving the actual transaction. We essentially need credit/debit cards for Bitcoin for non-tech consumers to use it.
Cold storage is like stuffing cash under a mattress. You still get into the same problem of.. I don't want thousands of dollars in cash in my home. Maybe we'll need Bitcoin banks.

What? No you are making this way too simple. Why do you have to go to a bitcoin meetup to be interested? How do you know women have had the opportunity to learn about Bitcoin as much as men have? 
Honestly, as a man I could see many women already forseeing what kind of obsessed geeks go to many meetups and writing those events off as not worth the harassment they have to endure when geeky men gather together. If geek meetups and conventions were more friendly to women, then perhaps more women would attend.
Women not attending does not at all imply they are not interested.

Being honest because you asked. I felt like only the cat crib and the halo rig were "unique". What is unique about fitness equipment and generic electronics?

99% of my family couldn't do anything you described here. "easy" is relative.
