I think you've got to consider the EEA, countries doing pilots using private Ethereum chains for national digital currencies (China, Russia, Singapore, Dubai), Zug digital ID on public chain Ethereum, live flight insurance on the public chain, this isn't even touching all the legit projects being built on top of Ethereum (BAT, GNT, OMG, REP, yada yada yada).. Surely you dont think they just looked at chart volatility and assigned a score? Which speaking of, ETH hugged $300 for about 4 months before moving up and seems to now be hugging $1000.
Edit: Then the icing on the cake is ETH processing 1M+ tx/day

You mean community consensus? Lol you're acting like he can flip a switch &amp; do anything he wants.. I don't see ETC rallying despite BTC shills attempts to legitimize it.

Yep, ICO scams.. Oh wait, and the EEA members.. Oh yeah and it was good enough for Storj to hop the fence. Oh and there was that one guy who founded Mozilla, Firefox and created JavaScript building an ad platform on top of it.. But anyways, as you were...

I don't think it's just smart contracts anymore man.. That's old news, and since we're talking about hypothetical situations.. Hows BTC going to compete with Raiden, zk-snarks, PoS, sharding, interoperability​ between private &amp; public Ethereum chain with Fortune 500 companies &amp; regulators? Smart contracts should absolutely not be ran on a side chain.. So you're gonna lock up your BTC and just put your trust into RSK? Get real man.

I dont think he follows your logic, and neither do I.

Funny they actually had a fix already in place and announced it just as the conference started.. Pushed everything back .5 Hrs

Ethereums Market cap disagrees with you.

So RSK code is a copy paste of EVM but RSK has first mover advantage? At least come up with something you can say with a straight face..

I've bought my freedom with ETH tho so...

Cool story from your 3 day old account, this should be too hard.. 
Centralized? - Less than BTC (Chinese Cartels)
Inflationary? - Creation already reduced by 10% due to ice age, will ramp up until switch to PoS where inflation will be less than BTC.
Mutable database? It was a decision made by gaining consensus of all nodes.
Premine? Satoshi mined for a while before anyone else started, might as well have been a premine, he holds more than ETH devs.

When are they announcing the BEA? Lol Fortune 500 companies won't touch BTC with a 10' pole. Place your bets accordingly.

Last day to balance your portfolio ����

Ice age has already slowed down the creation of ETH by 10%, this will ramp up until the switch to PoS when ETH inflation will be less than BTC. Place your bets accordingly, as if today was your last day...
