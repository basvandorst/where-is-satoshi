Bitcoin isn't a stock though.

Only invest in crypto if you believe it has long term value and will see more widespread adoption.  If you're trying to day trade bitcoin to get rich you're likely going lose some money, and I agree it's not worth the stress. Only invest an amount you are comfortable with losing.  
For example, I'm moving to hold 5% of my total investment portfolio in bitcoin.  I will be ecstatic if the year end ROI is 30%.  That kind of return is extremely rare in passive investing, and it carries a great deal of risk.

Keep in mind any profits made trading bitcoin is taxable in the US.  The IRS probably isn't going to bother targeting you, but if you get audited it might get you in some trouble.

Bitcoin's value depends on its utility as a currency and continued adoption (it has no intrinsic value, and no powerful nation states to protect it).  Any number of alternate cryptocurrencies could replace bitcoin as the crypto of choice if bitcoin backers lose confidence.  
Full disclosure I'm pretty bearish on bitcoin and crypto in general.  There will always be some utility in crypto, but interest in bitcoin has turned into blind greed in these past few months with no underlying change in the everyday use of bitcoin.

Don't confuse BTC with normal assets.  It's extremely volatile and no one is really sure what the true value is yet.  It can and has gone through significant and prolonged declines.  If that happens how are you paying the loan back?
Mortgages aren't considered risky because the asset you are buying has utility (shelter).  If the housing market crashes, you just keep living in your house.  If the bitcoin market crashes, you can't do anything with your bitcoin besides wait it out or eat the loss.

The number of people on this subreddit that think BTC is free money is a bit alarming.  It's not concerning if its mostly kids with their "life savings" of a few thousand dollars in crypto.  But when I read about people leveraging themselves or liquidating their 401k to go all in, I start to worry that this is actually a bubble.
Long term, I'm bullish on crypto.  But I'm also not investing more than 10% of my total portfolio.  If too many people overexpose themselves in BTC than it is by definition a bubble.  Luckily, this subreddit is just a fraction of a fraction of the potential user base for crypto.

You can retire a millionaire with a $50k salary with a traditional stock/bond portfolio in tax advantaged accounts.  It's a long and boring plod, but plenty of frugal people do it.
You're corrent in that all investments carry risk. Equating crypto to index funds is grossly underestimating the risk of crypto though.

Buying a house isn't equivalent to investing in securities.  Most people finance a house to provide utility in the form of shelter. The housing market is only a concern if you are moving.  
If you are investing on margin, at any point when the market dips you have to sell off your assets and cover the losses.  Of course the potential return would be greater.
Finally, speculating on bitcoin is nothing similar to mortgages or stock investing. I'm hodling bitcoin like everyone else on this sub, but it's important to realize crypto is still an extremely risky investment. I believe crypto will increase in value long term, but short term volitality is guaranteed, and you should be prepared to weather big dips.
