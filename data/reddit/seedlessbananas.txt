Years ago when bitcoin was valued at $15 I told my dad to invest. I was 13, but understood (for the most part) how cryptocurrency worked. He didn't understand it and didn't want to take my word for it. I didn't have paypal or anything to buy it with soo.
Now. It's soared, we know. I tell him he should've invested but he's in a stage of denial constantly stating it's going to plummet to be worth nothing. Then it rose to it's peak the other day. Now it drops a little and oh god all I hear him say is "I told you so, didn't I predict this". 
I wish I could teleport 3 weeks into the future where it's worth $10k a bitcoin.

I think my guess was pretty spot on, it dipped to 5800 and charged right back up haha. Man do I wish I had enough money to invest.

It will most definitely drop more before it recovers. I would buy back in around 5800 or 5600. I'm slightly new to this, but I've been doing pretty decent predicting it's value fluctuations.

Could be even sooner by the looks of it.

Damn lol, the only coin i have are $1.32 that i've gpu-mined on and off over the last 3 weeks :( i'm a college student so i dont have the money to invest right now, which sucks because now would probably be my only chance to make decent money off of it. Feelsbadman
However, I did make 12 cents off of mining during the dip rofl
