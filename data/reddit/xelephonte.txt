He’s wrong. I am an expert on Cryto and Bitcoin (though I can properly spell crypto for some reason)...and I can resoundingly say Bitcoin will absolutely grow a Gazillion times and more. Yes, Bitcoin will grow infinite times and more. Soon, 1 BTC will equal 1,000 infinite. If not, I will eat my shorts (literally whatever I short BTC on, I will eat).

Bitcoin demographics and the road to $1.7 trillion Bitcoin market cap (aka the $100K Bitcoin price). 
It’s certainly achievable being that the US government spends that much on healthcare every year. So, the only question is how long will it take barring no interferences from the economy, government regulation or institutional investors. Bitcoin still has not won the hearts of baby boomers (or older), poor people and high class elitists and women (which I heard can be won with a box of chocolates). Bitcoin is predominantly purchased by young 18-45, middle class white and Asian males. As an African American, this makes me in the extreme minority. Obviously, mass adoption and consumer confidence is the road to this $1.7 trillion market cap and beyond. I’m not so concerned about age, race, gender and wealth class as all will follow once mass adoption and consumer confidence has been established. Any thoughts on Bitcoin demographics?

This is arguably the stupidest thing I’ve read all month. First of all we are yet to see what would happen to Bitcoin under a financial collapse because Bitcoin was adopted after the recession (better yet in response to it). We have observed when stocks fall, Bitcoin also falls as in the many signs of 2018.  5200 is a very random buy order. Why not $900 or $4200? Just random.
@_date: 2018-09-18 14:23:59
Whatever may happen, it’s interesting. This is one of the most dim-witted comments I’ve read. What if Bitcoin falls to $2,000, would that be interesting. And why can’t you wait for the next 5-6 months? If the past 5-6 months of volatility have taught you anything, you would not be so optimistic. The past 5-6 months has been awful and this whole year has been rough for Bitcoin and crypto in general. Your comment is crytogrip-like delusion.
@_date: 2018-09-12 19:21:46
What is going on.
Hoping the whales don’t read this especially if I am correct. But, I would analyze the crypto market now still in a massive bear market that will continue to descend to $140 billion something this year barring no major news announcements like an ETF, hard fork, etc. I predict the rock bottom price for BTC to be $4800 to hit between now and end of Jan. 2019. We are not in a flattening period yet but are getting closer (the point where you can buy BTC at rock bottom prices). As the crypto market descends towards $140 bill, Bitcoin dominance will continue to increase as high as 62% of the crypto market which would result in a $4800 price around a total crypto market cap of $140 bill. Until we reach the flattening period, I believe the whales will use this lag time to manipulate the markets through pump and dump, wash-and-repeat in order to accumulate more BTC. Until Bitcoin and the crypto market is revitalized, the whales will create as much FUD and FOMO as possible under the illusion that another big bull run is about to occur. But, I can’t see that happening. THE NEXT BIG BULL RUN WILL LEAD TO BITCOIN SURPASSING $100K and not some fake bull run to $10K, $12K or $17K as we have all witnessed since it hit $20K. So, amidst all this uncertainty, the best thing you can do is HODL and accumulate more Bitcoin. And stop checking the crypto market everyday and every week. Bitcoin will serve you bet if you buy it and then look away for 5 years.
@_date: 2018-09-18 14:42:04

@_date: 2018-09-06 19:07:51
Bitcoin hitting rock bottom may not happen in January 2019 but it will certainly happen with the Tether ticking time bomb. The bigger the trading volume Tether gets in purchasing Bitcoin, the likely it it is to explode. During summer of 2018, TETHER REPRESENTED 80% OF BITCOIN TRADING VOLUME. Tether is eating up Bitcoin volume and this conspiracy can’t go on forever. I don’t think it makes it past end of Dec. 2019. It will get exposed in 2019 after more HODLers want to cash sorta like the Bernie Madoff Ponzi scheme. Tether and Ponzi are synonymous. Tether will be responsible for Bitcoin’s fatal fall down to high $2K/low $3K. This is the big elephant in the room that everyone continues to ignore. Everyone is hating on Goldman Sachs lately as if they have anything to do with Bitcoin’s fall, but people will unleash their real rage and hatred when Tether explodes as the fraud that it is.

Cryptogrip you’re delusional. Tether is the modern day Mt. Gox and we saw Mt. Gox did to Bitcoin...it led to 4 very stale years and lots of mistrust and concern regarding Bitcoin. BTC might be $100K today had it not been for Mt. Gox’s fallout. Mt. Gox is entirely responsible for the 2013 crash where BTC fell from $1100 in 2013 down to $175 in 2015. Yet, you are not learning from history and disregarding Tether which is the prop that continues to hold BTC from collapse. Once Tether goes, BTC will hard and it will simultaneously take Bitcoin a good 4-5 years to recover. Fool cryptogrip once, shame on you. Fool cryptogrip twice, shame on cryptogrip.

So the Goldman Sachs story was fake news. And it was exactly like I stated at the time all of you were upset about the story...it’s the whales manipulating the market. The whales don’t exactly need a news story to pump and dump Bitcoin, they just do. When will you people understand that when Bitcoin is experiencing a flattening period, barring no news announcement, it only abruptly moves because of whales since everyone else during this period is a HODL. We are in a session of flattening period where the whales will create minor pump and dumps followed by a flattening time window. It will eventually dip below $5K. That is an inevitability.

It’s exactly how the whales lull people to sleep. Imagine if they went from the all time high of $830 billion total cryto market cap to $220 billion where it stands today (roughly 25% of the January 2018 high)...if the whales dumped that much overnight (as if it’s even pragmatic or feasible), then it would be way too conspicuous and it would create total chaos in the crypto world. Instead, slowly dumping the market capitalization of Bitcoin and crypto as a whole...is easier for people to accept and grasp. It’s like a rapist who befriends his victim and charms them with free shit just to brutally date rape them and their victim never seeing it coming or understanding what happened. Sorta like that.

When dormant whales begin to become active, that’s a sign of only 1 thing. Doom. This whale is a non-participant meaning he’s not playing the same game nor is he in cahoots with the other whales. This is a whale who do not see any immediate hope in BTC and is ready to sell. So, he is preparing for a massive hidden order among various exchanges which could be the start of a mini-dump. Of course, $1B is hardly a wave in the Bitcoin world these days but it certainly does not help BTC’s really bad year. Based on my understanding of Bitcoin trends and behavior, this latest activity will have no major effect on BTC’s price. It alone could lead to a tiny chain effect resulting in BTC’s current price of $7270 dropping by $200 at the most. Nonetheless, it won’t have any effect on the whales plans other than for them to be wary of wallets like these. It is a very rare occurrence marked nothing more than unique and mysterious. But ultimately it is non-news...the equivalent of a very rich man winning the lottery.

Good question. If all he does is tweet “Bitcoin”, it won’t have much of an effect. But, if he tweets, “I bought some Bitcoin and will work with SEC to approve Bitcoin ETF.” Bitcoin will skyrocket. If he tweets “Bitcoin is a threat to world order and democracy and it’s very suspect.” Bitcoin’s price will fall. Obviously, Trump has the ability to influence stock prices as we have witnessed directly from his Chinese tariffs/trade wars and indirectly via his day-to-day sentiment in the form of tweets. So, Trump has the ability to influence Bitcoin price based on the message from his tweet.

Even if stop loss orders had a role, they would still need some market mover to tigger them. They’re all not going to be filled unless there are large market movers manipulating the market in one direction. And the usual panic is a natural product of daytraders and weak HODLers but it doesn’t remotely have a significant effect. What does are the whales with wallets that each 1000+ BTCs thus representing 40% of the BTC market. You see the manipulation larger in altcoins like ETH and BCH because the whales are greater stakeholders with altcoins. Bitcoin is actually far less manipulative and stable than altcoins. That’s why any responsible investor should stick to buying Bitcoin.

The real question...has cryptogrip ever been in right in his life? Of course not.

In this article back in Jan 2018, he said BTC would triple to $50K. It was currently $17K at the time. 
Then as he continues to be wrong, his shortens his long for BTC from $50K down to $25K.
He’s been doing this all year along. Yes he accurately predicted BTC would hit over $10K last year but that’s half as impressive considering his prediction was $11K nearly 50% off the actual high of $20K. Tom Lee really doesn’t know anything. Plus, his views are always compromised due to his conflict of interest.

It’s $1 billion worth of Bitcoin which translates to something like 144K BTCs and not like a million BTCs and certainly not something impossible like 1 billion BTC. Dumping $1 billion worth of Bitcoin is not impactful as you may think so. The whales would eat it up quick and maintain order in the crypto world. I’m not implying it can’t have any effect...it can but it’s minuscule. The whales would love using it as a catalyst/narrative for why Bitcoin suddenly falls.

Together you’re being moronic. Bitcoin is not just a blockchain currency. It’s a form of investment. And Trading 101 would tell you behind any investment, there are risks. Behind every investment, there are major stakeholders. They exist with Bitcoin just like they did with Enron. In Bitcoin, they’re called whales and they manipulate the price everyday to get their desired result which is collecting more Bitcoin. Illegal acts have existed with Bitcoin. It occurs when these whales conspire in message groups to pump and dump Bitcoin. It occurred with the Mt. Gox exchange mysteriously losing 850,000 bitcoins. Traders lost money and value because of Mt. Gox’s deliberately illegal acts. You have to be a moron to think that there wasn’t any foul play involved with Mt. Gox. If no illegal activities were involved, Mt. Gox would still be around. This is why the SEC refuses to accept an ETF and this is why major banks and institutional investors stay away from cryptocurrency because it’s still roots in lots of illegal activities. To imply that illegal activities does not happen in Bitcoin would be beyond dismissive and ignorant. The company Enron was not a scam, it genuinely provided a product/service. But, it was utilized as a scam the same way Bitcoin has been in the past. This, this logic that an existential investment is legit until it collapses is very wrong.

Why Sundays?
Why do people buy on Fridays as we have often seen spikes to just to be corrected beginning Sundays? Why are prices lowest on Sunday or the beginning of a bear run? Some of the biggest falls this year began typically on Sundays. Bitcoin hit its ATH at $20K on a early Sunday morning before immediately correcting during the week. Buy BTC on Sunday makes it easily the most precarious day of the week. Thoughts?

I respect those who HODL.
Whether you HODL because you strongly believe in the concept of cryptocurrency or blockchain...or you HODL because you’re a bad trader and don’t believe in daytrading...or you HODL because you actually use Bitcoin for transaction...I respect you. After all, the whales are the biggest HODLers. The whales don’t actually define true HODLers but they believe in Bitcoin’s adoption-and-fortune more than everyone. That’s why their primary interest is to accumulate as much Bitcoin as possible towards our 21 million destination. This is why they run constant buy sell walls, rinse and repeat, pumps and dumps, etc...all just to get novice traders to sell. The whales all want your Bitcoin because they know it will prosper in the end and become the new gold. To those who can’t be shaken or swayed by such manipulation, I respect you.

They call it a hidden order assuming it was a stop sell order. I doubt it just like I doubt whales can’t see/access stop sell orders. They can. This is likely a daytrading whale who has $100 million he can afford to lose...and he noticed a trend that the bigger whales were going to dump BTC again below $6K so he panick sold. This is something the whales don’t like. They don’t like being beaten at their own game even though technically they won this smaller whale should sold at $6500 which would have saved him $2.4 million. But, my point it was NOT a stop sell order. It was definitely a market order that people are speculating it to hidden when hidden orders on most exchanges is an oxymoron. Don’t believe that whales can only see limit orders on exchanges, particularly on those Asian exchanges. Whales can see ALL orders, so this is smaller whale was smart by pulling a surprise on them and dumping $75 million of BTC for the whales to eat up. I kinda enjoy watching the whales feel powerless for a moment.

Very thin walls.
The whales have been running very thin buy sell walls since Bitcoin fell hard the first half of this month. Thin buy sell walls are an ominous sign of two things: (1) little activity and low Bitcoin volume, (2) a mechanism by Bitcoin whales to control the price meanwhile testing the market. They are looking for large hidden orders, testing the variation in the order books and checking for any major news stories. Bitcoin whales are very patient because they are in the driver seat. The rest of us are in the passenger seat some fearing for our lives while other hoping to experience a joyride. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin whales are currently driving the car at about 30 mph. Really the most important thing for HODLers is to remain in the car and buckle up tight. It’s going to be a long journey and any of those who think they can hop out of the car and hitchhike into a faster car will end up being left behind. Don’t end up a hitchhiker. Stay HODLing.

Reaching that point when all those “a year ago Bitcoin was only $X” arguments will be refuted. That date could hit as early as Sept. 1st 2018 if Bitcoin falls below $4900 since it’s Sept. 1st 2017 price was $4900. But, I suspect it will hit in early October. One thing for sure, Bitcoin will be well below $20K in Dec. 2018.

Is there anyway can confirm this as genuine/true? This is really important because whenever the whales want to reck a shorter, they do so by first buying that shorter’s massive BTCs and then pumping up the price at X price first to hold that shorter in regret for a few days. They love creating a mental test in hope that shorter will rebuy those same BTCs at a more expensive price encouraging them to believe that Bitcoin will go up in price. As soon as they save this mini-whale rebuying a similar order at higher price, they dump Bitcoin in classic bull trap fashion.  Likewise the adage “don’t buy the dip”...you shouldn’t buy the rise either. But, in this instant if this rekt news is true, it’s a very good time to buy the rise because the whales will want to reck this shorter. If anyone knows for a fact this tweet is true, please confirm.

“To push the price to $10k per BTC it only takes a purchase of 4k bitcoin on coinbase pro.” What does that mean? Are you stating that we are $4K away from Bitcoin being $10K which is obvious to anybody who knows elementary school math. Reading your statement, it sounds like you’re saying that we need 4,000 BTCs purchased in order to reach the $10K Bitcoin price. 4K BTC is currently worth roughly $26 million dollars. A purchase of this magnitude...basically if somebody purchased $26 million of BTC, it would only raise BTC’s price about $1.50 and definitely NOT $4,000. So, I have no idea what the hell you’re trying to say because your statement is poorly worded. It takes about $60 billion worth of BTC or a purchase of nearly 10 million BTC to raise BTC’s price to $10,000. Also the Tether time bomb is not necessarily the start of the bull run, more likely the start of a bear crash. You seem intelligent but you’re statements are just so incorrect.

There is no impending catalyst that will result in Bitcoin reverting to a 5 digit number. People don’t like your comment because it’s depressing and it eliminates their hope. They want to hear Bitcoin will hit $25K this year. But your last statement is a little absurd. Bitcoin doesn’t need to be adopted by the masses as a payment methods in order to increase in price. If an ETF is accepted by the SEC, then see you at the moon. That is the type of development that could totally refute your statements here. But, as it currently stands, you’re right.

But, I predicted this weekend of stagnancy just like I knew last week would fall miserably. So, what’s happening next week? More stagnancy.. Bitcoin will not fall below $6700 until June; however it will hit $7K by month’s end before recovering a few hundred dollars. We have some very unexciting times ahead. That’s just the cold hard truth. Whales right now want people to be comfortable with stagnancy as opposed to sharp falls. They will continue to manipulate volume to lure inexperienced traders and daytraders which represents the bulk of their new money during stagnant days. As soon as people see stability through stagnancy, they will look away come June 5-6 where another big drop take place far below $6700 to $6300 and beyond. Until then, Bitcoin will remain between $6800-$7700.

Don’t have to believe in Bitcoin to believe in the power of greed. 2019 may not be a great year for Bitcoin but it won’t be a dead year either. The whales are greedy and will always look to bait new money to investing in Bitcoin. That’s why there is no way Bitcoin will hang around the $3400-$4200 range the whole year. It could dip to $1900 or rise up to $6000 before falling back into the $3400-$4200 range. But, there is no way it will remain in this $800 range for 365 days. That would be a relatively unprecedented range for Bitcoin and is the least of possibilities. I personally believe Bitcoin will hit both $1900 and $6000 in this same year.

Surely the next major bull run will be predicated by an SEC-approved ETF. Because institutional money has not touched Bitcoin yet. Sure some institutional investors experimented with buying Bitcoin on an individual level but not on behalf an institution or bank. I remember when Bitcoin soared from like $13,500 to $20,000 in 8 days, all the crypto analysts claimed that institutional investors had finally entered Bitcoin. But, there was never any evidence of that because it was bullshit. Until Bitcoin is backed by major banks or an ETF is approved by an SEC, institutional investors will not touch Bitcoin with their clients money. It would be too reckless. What caused that spike in Dec. 2017 were the whales...that was their final pump, the pump of all pumps designed to bait inexperienced traders thinking it was surely going to go $25K and beyond. The whales did not know that the Bitcoin momentum continued beyond the new year since TV and radio commercials started advertising Bitcoin in Dec. Since February 2018, I have not seen a single Bitcoin TV ad. Then came all the negative news from Japan, South Korea and India which the whales identified as the start of a bear market. The whales used the announcement of Bitcoin ABC as an opportunity to perform a final crypto pump of the year and since then, it’s been on a downward spiral now 5.5 months since the high in early May 2018. So what is ahead? I suspect one little pump by the end of the year before sudden doom beginning January 2019. Short-term future, Bitcoin looks very bleak. Long-term, I think it has the potential to hit $1M and beyond.

Everyday seems like a long slow grind with occasional spikes and falls. Volume continues to diminish and Bitcoin trends continue to emulate the 2013-2014 Bitcoin bull run to bear market. I don’t see the circumstances any different today other than the looming effects of volatility in the stock market. No Bitcoin ETF is imminent and the release of Bakkt will not have any effect. The next time Bitcoin hits $20K, it will far surpass that number. But, that date is far from anytime soon. This isn’t my FUD speaking, but sadly the worst is yet to come.

They will fall back a year...but Bitcoin’s price 2 years ago, but Bitcoin’s price 5 years ago...

“Why are you into bitcoin?  For me, it's a chance to hold hard money, secure, and inflation limited.”
Oogally that theory was valid until the hard fork of Bitcoin Cash which basically imposes that when supply of a particular coin is exhausted, developers can just create a hard fork to generate a new supply of that coin. With Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin’s supply virtually doubled. Bitcoin Cash is identical to Bitcoin in code with the exception of block size limit. That’s what makes cryptocurrency a precarious asset and form of investment. There are far too many coins and hard forks in existence. Why does Bitcoin Gold and Bitcoin Silver even exist other than serving as scams? The whole idea of “finite supply” is contradictory when hard forks can be erected. Sure, Bitcoin Cash at $420 today hasn’t taken away too much from Bitcoin’s true value, not to mention it’s impractical to interpolate Bitcoin’s price today if BCH, BGold and Silver didn’t exist. I assume BTC would be in the same ballpark. But, remember when Bitcoin was $17K, BCash was $4K taking off a much more significant chunk of Bitcoin’s true value. And this will be more concerning with Bitcoin’s fate when the crypto market is in the trillions. Developers will get greedy and erect more hard forks to further distribute more wealth off Bitcoin. So, if you’re a firm believer of Bitcoin’s finite supply, you’re vastly misinformed since hard fork exist and will continue to exist in greater numbers.

The reason why the whales choose to have several days/weeks of small pumps just to be erased by one single HUGE dump... and is that it gives average traders the illusion that Bitcoin is performing well since most of the times, it’s on the up.

How much stocks affect Bitcoin’s price.
Very little. The whales dictate Bitcoin’s price more than anything during a dry spell. We’re in a dry spell. When the bulls run again, the crypto markets are influenced by everyday traders. Stocks can influence whales but only as much as they choose to let them influence it. But, these past few dormant weeks where the crypto market was holding between $217-$221 billion was exactly like I suspected - the whales were trying to gauge the stock market. If the economy crashes, so will Bitcoin. People lose faith in volatile assets during an economic recession, depression etc.  So, yes we should pay attention to the stock market but only to an extent and understand that they aren’t necessarily correlated.

Where are you getting this notion from? Are you just satisfied you aren’t losing Bitcoin value in significant amounts because it’s extremely dormant these days? I would rather have volatility so I can recover my funds. But low volume particularly is terrible. Bitcoin needs high volume to prove that it’s more than just an asset and instead what it was designed to be...a currency. Cash has high volume per day because it’s a currency.

What is happening - Monday, Oct. 15th.
I’m not calling it just yet but Tether appears to be imploding, trading at its lowest levels last night since April 2017. Tether’s currency is as precarious and risky as Venezuelan fiat currency. This current fiasco is related to the significantly noticeable price discrepancy of Bitcoin among various exchanges. Why is this important? Obviously, we know Tether is a scam that is not sustainable similar to Bernie Madoff’s Ponzi. Tether could go 20 more years before it falls but it will collapse unlike Bitcoin which will exist throughout our lifetime. I predict Tether will collapse within this next decade if not next year or so. The Tether collapse is a fundamentally important step in the evolution and maturity of Bitcoin. When a particular coin is only created as a temporary fix to Bitfinex Exchange being hacked, you know that’s not a good sign. Tether was created as an IOU but has evolved into the fake pumping of Bitcoin. Sure, some people use it as a tax haven but it’s true intent was never legitimate or honest. Nothing has really happened in the Bitcoin world the past 12 hours. It’s as stale as it has ever been. But, the Tether fiasco on Bitfinex has led to the pumping of Bitcoin on their exchange resulting in a $7,000 price totally deviating from other exchanges. Don’t be misled and think that Crypto has experienced a gain recently. It has not. This is the calm before the storm.

Bitcoin continues to hold up really well always retaining $6,000 throughout this year long bear market. I wonder what price would open the floodgates, both for a major bull run or bear run. I think if Bitcoin surpasses $12K again, then we’re officially in a bullrun. However, if Bitcoin drops below $5,000, the floodgates will open and even the biggest HODLers will sell. It’s human nature to get excited and to panic. Obviously, Bitcoin can’t stay in the $6,000s for too much longer. Whales and average traders grow restless and they react. Anyone have predictions on floodgate prices?

The day Bitcoin surpasses the Dow Jones index will truly be a glorious day. 
The closest we had was that December 20, 2018 date when Bitcoin was its all time high at $20K and Dow Jones was roughly $24,700. I think Bitcoin will surpass Dow Jones one day but it will not be anytime soon and certainly not until the next bull run. I predict the Dow Jones will face a major correction followed by a panic dump resulting in a $15K price. Then, there will be little more dumps resulting in a bottom of $12K. I see Bitcoin teaching it’s bottom in the first quarter of 2019 to which all the Bitcoin pessimists will call it the end of Bitcoin. But, it will recover. Right now, having money in fiat currency seems like the best option.

People won’t look at a price a year ago and be like...it’s now lower than it was a year ago, time to sell. I just it’s FUD or FOMO...tied entirely to emotions and Bitcoin value. If somebody told me Donald Trump would be President in 2013, I would disregard them...just being honest. Of course in a country where rural rednecks in flyover states ended up deciding the election, Trump can be president. And in a very progressive country like Canada, marijuana can be legalized. However, if somebody told me that 5 yrs ago, I wouldn’t believe it. The current state can really blind your outlook in both positive and negative directions. Well said, Cryptogrip.

Okay first of all who the hell are you, cipherspace? I’ve never heard of you but just your name sounds noob as hell. Secondly, what drug are you going on? Crack cocaine? Hennessy? Limp Bizkit? You’re preaching false hope predicated on nothing. You’re like every mega preacher who tells his large denomination to donate every dollar from their measly paychecks and God will reward you with an immense return (like in that case, why are we investing in Bitcoin? We should be investing in God). You’re a “redditor for a day” who claims you’ve been around for a few years and the most exciting time for Bitcoin in 10 years even though Bitcoin in theory has only been around for under 8 years. You could just be a lobbyist sent by the whales to generate hope and excitement in a Bitcoin reddit but I doubt that since you sound too fucking stupid and the whales are smarter than doing something like that. Really, I just revert to my original which is...you are under the influence of some hardcore drug. Most definitely.

Guys I don’t control the crypto Bitcoin market, so don’t blame me. I don’t create FUD, the whales do, the markets do. I have every right to make a Bitcoin prediction based on historical figures whether it’s FOMO or FUD. And my FUD has been far more accurate than Cryptogrip’s baseless FOMO over the stupid Bakkt hype he’s been stroking himself to. I’m a realist, cryptogrip isn’t. Cryptogrip thinks Bitcoin will hit $100K by end of 2018 and we will be driving flying Lambos to the moon.

Top 5 Most Annoying Bitcoin subredditors (they’re also subhuman). These are the 5 most annoying regular Bitcoin commenters you’ll find on this subreddit. If the mods could ban all of them in one day, that would be the only thing better than a Bitcoin pump. You will usually find them spamming this subreddit with meaningless speculation (all of them are illiterate) because they have absolutely no lives. So, if you see their posts, make sure to downvote them. 
 ... BitcoinAlways
Always comes up with some spur of the moment optimism because he’s secretly bipolar. He’s a big fan of fairytales.
 ....ThePhysicist
Thinks he’s very intelligent but knows less about Bitcoin than your average elderly person living in Rwanda.
 ...Cipher-Space
Total condescending noob who spends way too much in Bitcoin subreddit as his only social outlet.
 ...Cryptogrip
He’s not so bad, just an old senile man losing hair everyday. He doesn’t know much about anything but you just let him talk about his old WW2 stories and what not. Suffers from dementia and attention deficit order. God have mercy on his soul.
 ...BCashBeTrash

Your example is terrible and it doesn’t appear you have an understanding of market capitalization.  You keep saying “one” buy not being specific to anything in particular. Market capitalization = supply x price. If you have one billion units and the price is $100 per unit, you’re market cap is $100 bill. But if someone were to sell one unit at $99, the market cap would fall to 99,999,999 = 99.99 bill. What you meant to say was if 10 million units were sold at $99, the price would fall to $99 and the market would be $99 bill. If you’re going to try to teach basic market economics, at least understand what you’re saying.

Nobody knew Enron was totally broken in Jan. 2002. It had actually stabilized at under a $1/share. Nobody knew for sure it would totally collapse. Bitcoin has lost 65% of its all time value. It’s not far fetched to believe Bitcoin could also collapse. So, why not compare Bitcoin to a broken Enron stock? Also I hate the fact that you improperly use the word “fundamentally.” If you don’t understand what a word means, don’t use it. What the hell does fundamentally broken mean? Basically you can call anything “fundamentally broken” in hindsight. My poop was not fundamentally broken until I witnessed it get split in two. Then poopie was fundamentally broken.

And they were right. Now sure who said that, I didn’t. But whoever said Bitcoin can’t stay in the $6Ks for too much longer in June 2018...was $100% right. Because Bitcoin hit $7k followed by $8K in July 2018 before falling back to $6Ks in August 2018. What does that tell? That Bitcoin is still volatile and cannot remain in even 1K price range for a significant amount of time even though most Bitcoiners are so impatient and bored, that they want Bitcoin to move whether it’s up or down just to see it’s still kicking. Bitcoin could hit $7K or $5K within the next 30 days but it can’t stay $6Ks for too much longer.

Where do you all get your Bitcoin price data?
I think coinmarketcap is probably the ideal Bitcoin price site though tradingview is also great. Not entirely sure how accurate these sources are, I know coinmarketcap does a pretty reasonable job in averaging the Bitcoin prices among all the exchanges while taking a greater account at the larger exchanges. Bitcoin unlike a stock will never have a definitive price...but it should be within -+5% among all exchanges. That recent BitForex fiasco where prices were absurdly higher than Coinbase was an anomaly. The reason I ask is that I still have trouble grasping the peak crypto market cap of $830 bill in Jan. 2018. We’re at $209 bill now. Where did that $620 billion go? Nearly 2/3s of a trillion vanished out of thin air. That’s what scary about Bitcoin but also details it’s potential. I was convinced the total market cap was going to surpass $1 trillion in Jan...but I am beyond certain it will surpass $1 trill in the next big bull run. Basically, I don’t know whether to second guess the price sources or to believe that Bitcoin is extremely volatile to pumps-and-dumps leading to 100s of billion being wiped out at the blink of an eye...

(1) Bitcoin never fell to $5938. The whales have maintained support at the $6100 level. (2) Granting your $800 loss per Bitcoin assumption, then this whale would have lost $75 million not $100 million. Do the math. Nonetheless assuming he holds, he will soon recover that loss and even make great profits. But, I have no sympathy for someone who can drop $630 million on BTC assuming this madeup story is true. You know this guy is a billionaire and unlike us normal Joes, he has plenty of more money to use to recoup his losses. Basically, this is a guy who was up in Ritz Carlton hotels and drives a Bentley.

Why are you making up crap? There is no big war. It’s just an utterly quiet dead weekend. The last peak in volume occurred on the Monday with the threat of tether implosion. Since then, it’s been extremely quiet. If you’re bored, go watch a movie. Stop making up crap on a very quiet day.

Coinrail. My question for anybody who knows about whales manipulating the market is...we know that the Coinrail hack is not remotely the cause for this latest fall. So, I have one of two theories: (1) most probable theory: the whales were waiting for the perfect opportunity to crash Bitcoin and the Coinrail hack is the perfect coverup even though the whales don’t exactly need a cause to crash the cryptocurrency market. (2) The whales were planning on a crash beginning June 10th and the Coinrail hack coincidentally fell at the same time. Also, it’s not crazy to rule out the whales could be involved in hacking Coinrail thus giving them the rationale needed to why Bitcoin has fallen. Any thoughts?

$200K Bitcoin sounds like a fantasy but then again so did $20K bitcoin in 2014 back when it fell to $200. Buy $200K would require a $3.2 trillion market cap when the whole world wealth is $200 trillion. Sounds far fetched though I could see the possibility in 2030.

Am I the only one really hating GDAX down for maintenance? This would be acceptable if the cryptocurrency wasn’t a 24 hour market like the stock market. I know it hasn’t had too much of an impact - Coinbase inconveniently doing maintenance during peak evening hours usually from 8-9 PM (PST) but how is this possible? I’m not familiar with other exchanges like OKEX, Bitfinnex or Bitrex...whether or not they have these periodic freezes to do maintenance but it sounds very illegitimate and unethical. Just because trading on GDAX is paused doesn’t mean the whole cryptocurrency market pauses as well. That’s what disturbs me. A lot of activity can happen in an hour or so. If my discontent for Coinbase/GDAX wasn’t already at its all time high, these maintenance calls really takes the cake. It has already lost me money because prices immediately dive once GDAX is restored. I know GDAX at least gives you advanced courtesy notice but that still is not acceptable. If Facebook, Twitter and Google can all manage without shutting down their websites for an hour (and they don’t affect you financially), then why can’t GDAX manage. Really hating these people!

You sir clearly don’t understand how a market and it’s pricing works. There is no such thing as minimum price because the market can work like a balloon with a hole in it. You can keep pumping some air into it but all you need is a tiny hole to keep it deflating. If whales own just 10% of BTC, they can continue to deflate it through buy sell walls. So, by owning even 1.7 million BTC, they can deflate the market cap down to $0.  Of course, it will never go to $0 but it is very mathematically possible.

How much do you make per year? No I’m not really asking how much you make. That was a rhetorical question. But I am only curious in the facet that the most repeated word I hear in this subreddit is “payday.” I can’t understand it. Throughout my life, I’ve made salaries as low as $8K/year to upwards of $100K/year. But even when I made nothing, I never told myself I can’t wait until payday to do this. I’m American and I’ve never been able to understand other Americans rejoicing on payday to spend their menial wages after taxes on some titillating activity or investment. Not wanting to sound out-of-touch considering I don’t have any kids, never had a car payment in my life and have always had 0 debt as a result of studiously managing my expenses... I don’t think it’s healthy to have to wait until payday to buy more BTC. 
I find the Friday aka Payday fascinating in my research of bitcoin pricing because during the last bull run, Fridays were always the best day. Perhaps that could’ve been manipulated but I don’t think it was a coincidence. Small traders were always spending their paychecks on Bitcoin come Friday. I just don’t think there’s any amount you could possibly make from minimum wage to upwards of $1M/year where you have to depend on payday to be able to buy BTC. Obviously, I would never a deter a trader from spending her/her paycheck on BTC but I would strong advise to invest responsibly especially if you have kids/family to support. That and maybe I’m just sick of seeing the word “paycheck” in here. Thoughts?

Coinbase caters to whales.
I’ve repeated this many times and like every few structure Coinbase announces, nothing changes as far as their favorable treatment towards whales. They charge 0% for maker fees (limit orders) at the $50M level and 0.1% for taker fees (market and stop orders). Coinbase wants to increase liquidity even though they selfishly decided to impose fees for limit orders at the beginning of this year. When the whales aren’t active, Coinbase becomes nearly dead. There is little to no liquidity especially with altcoins which makes Coinbase a lacking exchange especially compared to the exchanges that have much greater liquidity. Coinbase knows they have a liquidity problem and they think they can fix this issue by some menial changes to its fee structure. They are wrong. Coinbase is one of the more expensive exchanges to trade on. Really the only thing they have going for them is their security and US-based status. If they were based in Japan or China, they would be completely irrelevant. I don’t trust most other exchanges and Coinbase does appear as trustworthy as they come even though I absolutely detest the CEO.
What are your thoughts on Coinbase? Do you think it’s fair the disparity between maker fees for whales vs small traders (under $100K)? If Coinbase really wants to inspire trading for small traders, they have to reduce maker fees. Obviously the Coinbase exchange is way better than trading directly on the Coinbase website but it’s still ridiculous that we have to pay fees for limit order. I guess they need more to keep the lights on even though I suspect they have a huge profit margin buying expensive champagne and travel costs. Ehh.

Let’s see $2.5k is one thousand dollars less than $3.5k.   Also, $2.5K is about 30% less than $3.5K meaning you can buy 40% more Bitcoin at $2.5K than $3.5k. So, the difference is significant.

BitcoinAlways do you read? I never said the word “surprised” once. I said I’m curious on the concept of living paycheck-to-paycheck for the sake of paycheck-to-check. I think it’s entirely habitual. I said I could never understand this cultural habit, never said “surprised.” But it’s good that you know Americans can’t cover a $400 emergency expense. It’s clearly over 40%. You’re really going to take information from the least trustworthy source in news, CNN. They even contact themselves in the article where they say 40% of Americans feel financially comfortable meaning 60% don’t, yet 40% can’t cover a $400 expense. So, are they implying that 60% don’t feel financially and only 2/3s of that group can’t cover a $400 expense. “Financially comfortable” is such a subjective term anyway.
I understand you’re a little triggered by my post even though of course I wasn’t attacking you. Part of that has to down with you being the biggest culprit of using the word “paycheck” which is fine - I’m not judging you.  It’s a little bothersome that people look at Bitcoin similar to a lottery ticket, where millions of Americans spend whatever disposable money they have on highly improbably lottery tickets. Likewise in this video below where they state at (6:25) the winner only gets 31 cents on every dollar they spend even though it’s actually 24 cents since after taxes you only get 50% of your winnings. Only 48% of lottery ticket revenue is spent on the winners and half of that is tax yet Americans are totally sold on this improbable dream of getting wealthy by winning the lottery.
At least with BTC, if you HODL, you get to keep all your winnings minus minimal trading fees and capital gains taxes. I’ve never bought a lottery ticket but the lottery ticket has been a staple of American culture and tradition even though it’s always been a scam. Imagine if those same people since 2010 bought BTC with their lottery money... the problem is BTC is still too inaccessible for a large percent of the population compared to the easy cash-buy at convenience stores. With the rise of smartphones, I could see a swift change and great adoption.

The deception behind volume.
I hear a lot of people excited about the volume of Bitcoin increasing since its fall in 2018 making their judgement based on the number of Bitcoins trades among the various exchanges. That is a terrible measure. Of course, more Bitcoin will be traded when the price is $3,000 than when it was $6,000. There may be greater volume in Bitcoins trades but not greater USD value. At its peak, Bitcoin traded at $25 bill 24-hr volume. The value is more important than the number of Bitcoins. The number of Bitcoins is a bad measure after Bitcoin has lost 80% of its value from its all time high. Volume is important but it’s very easy to be misguided when looking at the number of Bitcoins trades per day. Thoughts?

“If speculation is remotely close, the housing sector could be in the midst of a significant disruption. From shortening the transaction timetable and simplifying the closing process, to increasing trust and security, cryptocurrency has the chance to make a meaningful impact. In fact, it no longer seems to be a question of whether or not they will change the face of the real estate industry, but rather when.”
Agree/disagree? The real estate/housing market could be significantly benefited by using cryptocurrency to complete transactions. In 2018, the US real estate market was worth $33.3 trillion dollars (have to state the .3 since that’s only $300 billion). Forget a Bitcoin ETF, the real big progression for BTC will be when a huge sector or market taps into the adoption of Bitcoin to improve efficiency or security in its own market.

Would it really matter if Bitcoin was unbanned by an oppressive government with nearly half its 1.4 billion population in dire poverty? Sure it would have a positive effect on BTC but you act like Chinese citizens have just have boatloads of fiat currency they can invest in BTC. Bitcoin in China will not have the same surge as it does with South Korea or Japan, two countries that have a much wealth distribution. Wealth distribution is key to attracting investors in Bitcoin since it’s been observed that the mega-rich of the world (the Buffets, Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos) don’t touch Bitcoin with a 30 yard pole.

It’s so troubling that Bitcoin is only being used as an asset by the whales and not a viable form of currency as intended by Satoshi. The amount of volatility is totally related to its value as an asset. Imagine if the dollar could lose value like that in a single day. It certainly can especially if the Venezuelan bolivar can fall so hard to the point its worthless. How many of you have more confidence in Bitcoin value over USD value? The USD currency has been around for over 240 years. Bitcoin has been around 8 years. The bolivar was around for nearly 130 years before it failed. This is why I have trouble confiding in any currency and believe more in finite commodities like gold, diamond and silver. Bitcoin was always a finite cryptocurrency until it was hard forked into Bitcoin Cash. Hard forks were never in Satoshi’s vision. Now, they’re appearing everywhere like spam email. I don’t know if Bitcoin will experience mass adoption in our lifetime. But, I do believe in digital technology being the future and we are still at the infant stages of cryptocurrency similar to internet in the 90s. I can most certainly see Bitcoin hitting $100K by 2025 or the next major bull run. But, volatility continues to be Bitcoin’s biggest hurdle and also what keeps institutional money out like a moat. The whales will never give up their stakehold in Bitcoin because they are the biggest HODLers, sold on its long-term potential. But, if they suddenly give up on BTC after a decade of inactivity, it’s not far-fetched BTC could fall below $1K. Anything is possible.

Two type of people will win long-term: the HODLers like me and the lucky people who buy either right now or when it dips to the lowest).

Cipher are you like a noob? Just because you never seen a TV ad doesn’t mean they never happened. I saw several Bitcoin ads on cable news channels but never on prime time TV (like ABC, CBS, NBC). I do like your insular attitude that surely because you never saw a Bitcoin ad, it couldn’t have happened. Likewise if a tree falls in the forest and cipherspace is not around to hear it, it definitely doesn’t make a sound. Because cipherspace is the center of the universe. You are quite possibly the most ineptly vein person on this subreddit.

You clearly didn’t either read my post or comprehend it. I said that there will be a point when BTC returns to $4K in 2019 and people will be rejoicing. I also said that Bitcoin will return to $6K in the next 3 months meaning this event will happen first. These are not mutually exclusive events. If you don’t think Bitcoin is capable of returning to $6K and then falling right back to $4K and below, you clearly don’t understand the crypto market.

Cryptogrip give it a rest. You’re wrong. You’ve been wrong all year. This is not your year. You talked all summer about how Bakkt would resurrect Bitcoin and to expect a surge up until November. So what the fuck happened? Bitcoin is completely contradicting everything you said. Nobody except for Tom Lee is more wrong about BTC price predictions than you. And on a bloodshed day, you are so stubborn to still be defensive about your precious Bakkt. Fuck bakkt- we all know that was a ploy by the whales to generate interest in Bitcoin when it was very stagnant. No interest was generated so the whales finally decided to tank the old boy. They’re gutting it clean. You were wrong, just admit it.

Bitcoin’s 7 day chart chart looks like a falling meteor. Eventually, every falling meteor hits the ground. Will Bitcoin hit 0? NO IT WILL NOT. I know this FUD is driving people crazy but this is all manipulation. All of Bitcoin’s highs will resurface in the next few years. It will just take a while. Every major bull run has had its subsequent bear market. It’s not price correction but manipulation...the same manipulation that will emerge Bitcoin into over $100K following the news of an ETF or major government approval. Don’t trust me, trust history.

I don’t care for people who FOMO or FUD all the time...I respect people who remain objective not respond emotionally to the current state of Bitcoin.

No a troll is someone who creates false baseless FOMO  based on a stupid article he reads from the CoinTelegraphs, the Bitcoinists and the Motley Fools (that’s where Cryptogrip gets all his news from...only the shiftiest crypto hack websites that feed him nonsense FOMO all day long). Cipher space, who would you rather get your predictions from...someone like cryptogrip who does no TA and just copies and pastes Bitcoin tabloid predictions or someone like me who does thorough technical analysis from a daily, weekly and monthly standpoint, observes historical data, reviews current buy sell walls, understands the best days and times of the week to buy and sell Bitcoin, etc... That’s why my predictions this year have been right. I predicted Bitcoin will fall to the $4K before making another small run to the $7Ks before crashing again to $3600-$4200 range. The next time Bitcoin hits $20K, it will far kill that number. It won’t stop at $20K like last time...it will be part of the major bull run. All my predictions have been right. All cryptogrip’s predictions have been wrong because he doesn’t know shit.

Anytime the whales manipulate the market like this, it usually means they plan to do a massive pump to rekt all the extreme shorters and people who panic sell. This is the best time to HODL not sell. If the whales can dump Bitcoin nearly $3000 in 10 days, then they could pump it back up $3000 in 3-4 days. That is the general vibe these days: several days of dumps to be catapulted by a day or two of a massive pump. That’s manipulation.

Bitcoin hasn’t dropped in price, it’s remained relatively in tact. Whales are pumping Bitcoin cash using new money not Bitcoin’s market cap. In two weeks, Bitcoin’s value will be $6330 or higher. It’s not going to mysteriously fall to $5500. You’re paranoid because you’ve been doing meth. Quit the drugs and you’ll feel better.

Among the biggest gainers in the top 10 today:
1. Cardano (19%)
2. Litecoin (18%)
3. Stellar (16.7%)
4. Ethereum (15.3%)
5. Bitcoin (15%)
What this signifies is the little demand for this coin. So Cardano has the shortest buy walls because nobody in their right mind wants that shitcoin which is why it’s the number 1 gainer. Nothing changes about Cardano, it’s still followed by the no. 2 shitcoin lately which is Litecoin. Bitcoin is no. 5 but considering its reputation, being no. 5 gainer of the day is commensurate among the 10 list. Basically my synopsis is the biggest gainers aren’t the most in demand, they’re the least in demand. They have the biggest gains because their sell walls are non-existent. The biggest gainers are a reflection of the biggest shitcoins. Though, Bitcoin is certainly not a shitcoin. Just food for thought.

The $250, 30-minute Bitcoin pump.
Last night, there was a spontaneous $250 pump in 30 mins around 9:30 pm PST where Bitcoin soared from a median price of $6300 to $6550, which was observed most conspicuously among foreign exchanges. The pump wasn’t so significant on Coinbase. Now, I suspected this pump to be a total bull trap and so far, I stand correct. But, what’s behind this random bull trap that resulted in eating up stop-buy orders in the $6300-$6600 range?? Because that’s what the whales do. Obviously, it was the whales and no one else...even though it could always be some lone wolf (the “go big or go home” type of lone wolf), but I highly doubt it’s a lone wolf since they have not come around in quite a while. These days have been extremely slow and the volume would not complement a lone wolf’s conditions. Lone wolves particularly like to strike when there is more than moderate activity/volume. Lone wolves like to short Bitcoin. It was definitely the whales because that’s what they do. It’s been a long theory of mine that the whales have access to all the stop orders on exchanges, especially on foreign exchanges. This is why their moves are entirely calculated and they react to orders based on what is most financially beneficial or what move would allow them to collect more Bitcoin. I suspect Coinbase is rigged as well but I’m not entirely sure. I know for sure BitMEX, BitForex, Bitfinex and Okex are rigged (basically any exchange that ends in “x” or “k” - they’re all products of each other). Let me know if you agree/disagree or have other thoughts.

I guess this is why Cryptogrip really wants a 4K TV since it will be worth more than 1 BTC.

Their price predictions are based on nothing but FOMO. And don’t even get me started with Tom Lee who is the biggest nut. Cryptogrip thinks Bitcoin will hit $1 million this year once Bakkt gets released...any minute now lol. I’ve been accurate all year and Bitcoin will not touch 5 digits again this year and will hit $4800 early 2019. These yuppies who think Bitcoin will make a bull run out of thin air very soon...don’t know anything.

I absolutely hate people that think like you, that need some dumbass justification to make sense of today’s madness as if Bitcoin’s price fluctuation/volatility has a clear explanation. It doesn’t. The whales read all the market, limit and stop orders and they meticulously plan a pump and dump when it’s most favorable to them. The hard fork had no effect on their decision to dump Bitcoin today.

Do you guys remember the days when you would see Bitcoin ads on TV? That was less than a year again back in Dec. 2017 but it feels as ancient cigarette commercials. I would see Bitcoin ads everywhere including social media and Google. I would see TV ads encouraging retired seniors to buy Bitcoin. Then January happened and Bitcoin advertising took a huge hit. Many Bitcoin investment agencies hopped on the Bitcoin bandwagon way too late. By the time they started routinely airing Bitcoin ads in January 2018, Bitcoin’s price was only falling down from $20K. What this taught me is the potential of the Bitcoin bandwagon. It’s kinda like tattoos which were originally stigmatized as punk culture and evolved into the mainstream pop culture. Everyone is susceptible to being a follower. This is exactly why Bitcoin has the potential of surpassing $1M and beyond. There’s an excellent YouTube video explaining this phenomenon called “First Follower: Leadership Lessons from Dancing Guy.” Even the biggest Bitcoin cynics can succumb to buying Bitcoin eventually.

But, I’m not a psychic and I could be very wrong. A recession is very ominous for many things except for investing in bargain stores like Dollartree and Walmart (since everyone is broke). Bitcoin is yet to be tested by a bad economy since it was created after the last recession. This is a test I’m very curious about. Assume the worst, hope for the best.

4 Years Ago This Time...
Bitcoin had its final fall down to $175/BTC. I believe we are either at that point or very near the bottom. I think if there is another fall, it will be just like Jan. 2015...a big fall followed by a quick recovery from that fall all occurring in a short one week period. This would translate in today’s price falling down to $1700-$1900 before quickly reverting back to $4000. I think for all those who are experiencing FUD, it’s more important now that you HODL than ever.

Back in June, I predicted the absolute rock bottom crypto market cap for 2018-19 should be $140 bill. Roughly 8 hours ago, it hit a low of $140.8 bill much faster than anticipated especially considering $220 bill several weeks ago. Nearly 40% of the crypto market cap has been wiped very fast which has not happened since the Jan/Feb. fall from $830 bill. Of course, I’m not infallible and the crypto market could fall to $90 bill but I do genuinely believe we are very close to rock bottom if we haven’t hit it already. I knew the $6K Bitcoin support level was bullshit. I rightfully predicted Bitcoin would fall to $4200-$4800 and I’m still convinced that it will fall to $3800 for a brief moment which would result in a low crypto market cap than $140 bill. And the Tether implosion hasn’t even happened yet. Anyone who thinks Bcash is to blame for this recent fallout is an idiot beyond repair. It’s manipulation as always, the same manipulation that could occur when Tether collapses which could be no effect on Bitcoin. When an ETF failed in August, Bitcoin’s price remain unchanged. Then 10 days later, Bitcoin mysteriously fell by $500. Manipulation. Manipulation. Manipulation.

Feeling very bearish on Bitcoin. Here’s why?
Obviously, the past 7 days is not a good indicator of anything. It’s been Bart Simpson’ing. I am feeling very bearish on BTC (though I stay HODLing) because of this halvening. Miners are going to hit half the reward for mining a block of BTC which I think will only create anxiety and fear among whales. The whales see no momentum and they are the drivers behind the cryptocurrency market. Combine that with halvening and I can see utter chaos for the next couple weeks. Of course, old man Crytogrip will come around to tout his Bakkt which he has been doing since July but Bakkt remains a figment of the imagination. Halvening is here and I wouldn’t be surprised if the entire market fails to $60 bill. The whales could be create a bull trap the past 2 days and following the next couple days. I could see BTC fall to $1700. Not trying to create FUD but this halvening process complicate things. Let me know if you agree/disagree...

Arguably the most idiotic thing the Physicist has said yet. He leaped into Crytogrip territory. He clearly did not know about the $3,000 limit of capital losses which is only for married people. For single people or married people that file as single, the most you can claim is $1,500. This is something I absolutely hate about the tax system. It’s designed for you to get fucked. They get 50% on your capital gains but you can only claim $1,500 on capital losses. How messed up is that. But, it’s hilarious to think that people really want to invest in Shitcoin after having just suffered massive losses. Take your tax refund and buy Bitcoin just so you can lose more money? I think not.

Good video from 2015 predicting the 2017 Bitcoin $10K price stating that Bitcoin from here on is on a logarithmic progression not linear. And I totally agree with this chart which predicted Bitcoin would hit the $10K (5 digit milestone) near the very end of 207. The next milestone is $100K which this chart predicts will occur in mid 2021 (so June 2021). However, based on 2018 massive bear market, I’m not totally convinced. I think the chart can ring true with the announcement of a Bitcoin ETF...which if that occurs, Bitcoin will easily surpass $100K (maybe $300K). But, there is no momentum now and Bitcoin is not obligated to hit $100K in mid-2021 functioning on the logarithmic scale of a hypothetical chart. Thoughts?

Does anybody know anything about whitelisting on Coinbase? Basically, Coinbase encourages to enable whitelisting because it “helps secure your funds by limiting cryptocurrency withdrawals to only the addresses you’ve added to your address book.” I know Coinbase has had this for at least a couple of months but this is the first time it prompted me to enable it. Surely, anybody who has Bitcoin on Coinbase will tell themselves...why not?...as soon as they see the “secure” buzzword. But, is my Bitcoin not as secure without whitelisting despite Coinbase claiming their security is top notch impenetrable? I haven’t responded to this option but I suspect whitelisting is an unnecessary security layer that Coinbase creates so they can charge you when you want to withdraw your Bitcoin to an address outside of your address book?  If it isn’t broken, don’t fix it. And I think that’s all Coinbase is doing...trying to find clever deceptive ways of trying to nab you for more fees. Any Coinbase experts familiar with this option, I would appreciate some insight.

I really hate Coinbase.
Sure they might be safer to store your Bitcoin on as opposed to any exchange ending an x (BitForex, Bitfinex, Okex) even though safety and storing your Bitcoin on an exchange is an oxymoron. But, why I really hate Coinbase today is that they randomly froze all trades for Bcash at 0800 PST without giving us a major indicator. Not that I had any interest in buying BCH, but they do the same thing with Bitcoin. How is that ethical? Maybe they sent an email or wrote a press release but that’s not enough. They should indicate that on the exchange, some ticker cause it ticked me off. It’s still frozen and perhaps I should post this on the Bitcoin main page in hope that it can get their attention. Doubt it but no exchange should catch you offguard but not making such important news extremely easy to see.

Bitcoin Cash was trading at $4300 at one point around a year ago. Today, it’s barely $130. I get it cryptocurrency is flooded with manipulation including Bitcoin. But, how is a 97% drop even possible? BCH was $75 at one point taking the loss further into 98.6%. This leads me to believe even 100% is possible. That’s how altcoins get destroyed. But, a top 10 altcoins really? I fear that Bitcoin could fall a lot further because the whales maintain the same stakehold in BTC (around 40-50%). BCash just about Enron’ed itself. Despite the 2000+ currencies, I think BTC is the only credible one because you don’t hear Satoshi selling the same way Vitalik sells Ethereum left and right.
@_date: 2018-11-05 19:36:15
You guys it’s not rocket science. The price is held at $6400 because there is no momentum and any price move these days is directly correlated to the whales. They have full control and they know it. The psychological boundary exists only in that all the Bitcoin HODLers are convinced that it can’t fall below the $6000 wall when there is no basis in that theory.

I have mixed thoughts on the article. First of all and most importantly, **”Smart money (and increasingly, just more money), will flock to unlevered assets that have limited supply – gold, bitcoin, or other alternative assets,”** that was all true and fine until hard forks were developed implying that you can buy several equivalents of Bitcoin  (or enhancements since BCash  boosts an 8MB blocksize). So, I am not sold on this notion that Bitcoin has a limited supply; that sounds contradictory. You can identify gold having a limited supply since you can’t hard fork gold (unless they find a way to clone gold in a lab). Secondly, though a mostly well-written article, to a grammar police like myself, that line is dangerously irritating: **“If you have something that can potentially 50x”**, WHERE THE HELL IS THE VERB? I need a verb. Calling out any verbs. Maybe, if you have something that potentially profit 50x or can potentially give you a 50x return...funny because I was stating 50x Bitcoin return a few days ago and I got chewed up by everyone except you cryptogrip...
I like the very pragmatic theory about how Bitcoin could emerge into mass adoption: trillion-dollar US deficit, underfunded pension funds, and student debt has snowballed to $1.5+ trillion in the U.S... Also, there’s really high credit card debt (medical bills etc), high foreclosure, wages not growing with inflation, pretty much all the ingredients that could devalue fiat currency like USD the same way the Venezuela Bolivar failed.  
But where I wholeheartedly disagree with this article:
**Bitcoin is an asset that is non-correlated (volatile yes, but volatility that is unrelated to fiat investments)** Fiat currency is a measure of Bitcoin volatility so of course fiat investments are related to Bitcoin volatility. Fiat investments assuming she means money market funds, CDs or savings account (and not stocks, bonds or commodities) have a relation to Bitcoin volatility.
Overall, good article Cryptogrip and I think some of the stuff she said here could be prophetic.

And I know we’re at 2 years away before whether he has to eat his dick (end of 2020 means by Dec. 31st 2020)...so if Bitcoin hits $990,000 by Dec. 31, 2020 then he has to eat his dick since he said $1M. This is who McAfee is...his thoughts and predictions are entirely FOMO-driven. In the beginning of 2017, he predicted $500K by end of 2020 which is still impractical but 50% more practical than $1M.

This is a made up article. It’s not possible to buy BTC for 2 times its mid market all time high price. The only way possible is if the company was illegitimate running a scam. I can’t see a scenario where investors unknowingly agree to sign a deal where their investment firm can tap them to 2x the market price of BTC at any point. Not to mention, I don’t even believe it was 2x the market value of BTC since that was a very minute moment occurring on the early morning of Sunday, Dec. 17th. No way these jackoffs at the investment firm were sitting in their office on Satr night/Sunday morning waiting to buy BTC for their investors at 2x its all-time high, just like no way they did they set a stupidass stop-buy order at $20K and charge their investors double. The whole practice is unethical. I don’t believe it happened but if did...which sounds far more plausible is this shady investor firm charged their investors 5x the mid market price like when BTC hit $8K which gives it the much better pyramid scheme vibe. I don’t feels sorry for these investors. I mean how hard is it to buy BTC yourself or get a hardware wallet? But again, I don’t believe this bullshit story.

You guys are delusional if you don’t think that hard forks dilute Bitcoin — THEY DO! Hard forks have never been good for Bitcoin. Many of you have attributed Bitcoin’s most recent fall down to $3400 due to the Bitcoin Cash hard fork. The Bitcoin community leaders are a joke, both Roger Ver and Craig Wright creating all these hard forks since Bitcoin’s 2017 bull run. Funny how there were virtually NO hard forks in Bitcoin’s dormant years (2014-2016) and suddenly these hard forks spring like hoodrats on a Friday night. **If you really don’t believe Bitcoin Cash and SV don’t dilute Bitcoin, explain the latest fall right when SV was released?** This is the dictatorial cryptocurrency world we live in - decentralized my ass. It’s centralized at the core of losers like Roger Ver and Craig Wright, neither of whom are intelligent or educated enough to make these important decisions.

The BlackRock story is such bullshit on a number of levels. (1) First of all, I never even heard of BlackRock until this Bitcoin story now. It’s not to discredit them, they are a massively profitable hedge fund but only the 10th biggest. (2) I don’t even believe the whales are using BlackRock as a narrative to pump the crypto market the same way they used the hard fork Bitcoin ABC. I think it’s an opportune timing to pump the crypto market but I believe this minor pump is pure manipulation. (3) Most importantly, the BlackRock story tells us nothing. London Financial Times reported that “BlackRock is getting serious about the cryptocurrency market”...as opposed to what... they weren’t getting serious in the past? This is not news. Every investment company has been seriously evaluating cryptocurrency. To deny this is buffoonery. This story tells us nothing. So, what if BlackRock is getting serious? That doesn’t mean anything. I’ve been serious about doing cocaine for the past 20 years, never did it. This story really holds no information. Black rock is getting a working group.. is this the same working group that as existed for them since 2012 yet they still ignored the 2017 run Bitcoin had? Truth of the matter is...if BlackRock didn’t want to touch Bitcoin in 2017, there is no chance they will invest during a year long slump today. This is just a story to create false optimism during a very slow stagnant time. Nothing more.

All the BTC enthusiasts who trash altcoins every day referring to them as shitcoins, how is Bitcoin any better? It’s had 7 days of shitcoin-like crashing, dropping in the double digits percentage-wise. Many of you never imagined Bitcoin could fall below $6K and there surely was great support at the level...by whom? You couldn’t say...there was just some imaginary support the whales mislead you in believing. I said many times that Bitcoin would fall below $5K by the end of the year into the beginning of 2019. Many labeled me as a paranoid FUD pot-stirrer. No I just read historical trends and understand support at nearly 10x the start of the last bull run (when BTC was $600) can’t be held forever. Today, Bitcoin is performing exactly like every shitcoin and that’s why so many of you are in shock. I don’t care much for altcoins but unlike many of you, I don’t worship Bitcoin especially BCashBeTrash, he’s the biggest culprit. And any of you who would not sell at $6K but are now selling at $4.8K are delusional beyond repair. Sure, the pain hurts but at least hold until BTC returns to $6K which it will most certainly will in the next 3 months...or institute a stop-buy plan where you can rebuy BTC at a safe price.  Buying high and selling low is exactly how you go broke. You might have lost value in your BTC but you don’t lose money until you sell your coins...

Really good point there about people always selling prematurely. I made I guess it made sense to sell BTC at $1K in 2013 at its peak. But of course, the problem is people never buy back for fear it will totally collapse. Imagine after BTC hitting the $1K threshold in 201: and then it winked below $100. Imagine if BTC today was about $20 instead of $8K. Nobody could have foreseen the immense success and recovery of Bitcoin following several bull runs. Had BTC never recovered, then all those guys who sold at $1K in 2013 would be beating their chest. I genuinely believe Bitcoin’s next major step will be either surpassing $100K or utterly collapsing to $0. One of these two events will certainly happen within our lifetime. Cryptogrip, I don’t know if you’re familiar with the inspiration for Bitcoin which was ECash founded in 1983. The Bitcoin white paper was heavily influenced by ECash. Well those people who bought into ECash ended up losing after ECash dissolved in 1998 very much mirroring Bitcoin’s history. Obviously, Bitcoin is more sophisticated than ECash learning from the mistakes of its predecessor. But it’s still not far-fetched for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency to collapse as a result of worldwide government illegalization or replace it with a government-founded crypto stable coin. I don’t think BTC will end up like ECash but it’s not far-fetched to think so.

Glad you remember me old man cryptogrip. We just witnessed about $50 bill of crypto market cap wiped out today. BTC is almost down 50% from its 13.8K sitting at $8K. And you wonder why I’m feeling bearish? Why would any sane mind HODL in this manipulative climate? You HODL during a flat accumulation period. 2019 is a lot like 2018. Just lots of volatility and whale manipulation. Why can’t the greedy whales just leave it alone? Why do they have to create these extreme swings just to accumulate more crypto for themselves? They created this false pretense in the first half of the year that we were starting another bull run. I never bought that notion because BTC dominance was going up and BTC dominance never goes up in a real bull run.

The 2017 run was a sure thing. It started out at $1,000 and rose to $20K. Yet, all the major institutional investors avoid BTC like a Black Plague. Sure, it’s a cheaper entry point today but that isn’t exactly a rationale for institutional investors to buy BTC. To gain their assurance, they need to see major banks get behind BTC and that’s far from coming into fruition. A cheaper point was a year ago this date when BTC was $2,000 (a fraction of what it is today). Yet, all the institutional investors avoided it. You sound way too wishful and optimistic to discuss the overlying factors of what would propel the Blackrocks to get behind BTC. At this moment, there is nothing to gain their confidence. We would strong government backing or the BOAs, Wells Fargo’s to fall in line.

The longterm progression of Bitcoin is one that can be explained with lots of idle time. Not sure if “idle time” is a good thing or not...or whether it defines lackluster volume during the bull run offseason. Since the beginning of Bitcoin in 2011, it rapidly rose to $1000 in less than 2 years before falling hardly and losing nearly 90% of its all time value when it fell from $1500 to $175 in 2015. Then came the 2 years of idle time marked by slow steady growth into the next bull run of $20,000 before falling and losing nearly the same value nearly 90% today at $3700. How I explain this idle time is that its occupied by people who use Bitcoin for its true intention which is as a medium of exchange like money. That’s why even if there is never another bull run, there is a good percentage of traders who will continue to use Bitcoin as an exchange leading to its value rising. The bull run is activated by everyone else who seek to capitalize off it as an asset. When the whales identify this scenario, they further pump BTC and the bull run is officially activated. News media create more hype and FOMO is spread like wildfire. This is how the crypto market cap went from $20 billion to $830 billion in less than 11 months and it’s exactly why it’s fallen down to $120 bill today. FUD and FOMO are inherent in Bitcoin until institutional money and government intervention occurs to stop the manipulative practices in Bitcoin. Today in this idle time, Bitcoin is utilized by three types of people: HODLers, whales and people who use it for its true intention which is regular currency exchange. I’m glad for idle time because it marks another progression of Bitcoin into the next value tier ($100K, $200K, etc).

Has Bitcoin really made any progress in mass adoption since it was invented? The original miners and users of Bitcoin actually adopted Bitcoin as a form of currency which was Satoshi’s vision. Despite the logarithmic scale of Bitcoin’s market cap, it hasn’t many any strides whatsoever as an adoption. It may have actually gotten worse. Volume without the whales is completely dead. How many here have actually used Bitcoin to purchase something or transfer Bitcoin in exchange for something other than fiat currency? It’s very alarming that we have made less progress towards mass adoption than back in 2011 when BTC was conceived...

Not sure if you’re using technical terms like L2 scaling to obfuscate your argument. Perhaps, you could explain the concept of Layer 2 scaling because I honestly have no idea what it is. I could probably research it and bore myself with incredibly technical description of something I know nothing about. How does more exchanges translate to greater adoption? That’s a terrible argument. That’s like suggesting that a music artist who releases the most album is the best.  You could also say there are over 2000 crypto currencies today so surely mass adoption is increasing. No, that has nothing to do with mass adoption and frankly, I don’t think any of the technical aspects you stated have anything to do with mass adoption.

I begin to disregard you more when you clearly stated “start of the next bullrun” on the eve of Dec. 18th just to see your claim fall apart by Dec. 21st proving me correct once again and proving your falsehood once again.

The Physicist Are you enjoying the green?? You know the $10 drop in the crypto market. It’s Christmas right? Dummy. I told all you giddy fools that this was an obvious mini pump. Today was a drastic fall that wiped out a few days of good gains. You children are very easy to manipulate.

I AM HODLING. I'LL TELL YOU WHY.  It's because I'm a bad trader and I KNOW I'M A BAD TRADER.  Yeah you good traders can spot the highs and the lows pit pat piffy wing wong wang just like that and make a millino bucks sure no problem bro.  Likewise the weak hands are like OH NO IT'S GOING DOWN I'M GONNA SELL he he he and then they're like OH GOD MY ASSHOLE when the SMART traders who KNOW WHAT THE FUCK THEY'RE DOING buy back in but you know what?  I'm not part of that group.  When the traders buy back in I'm already part of the market capital so GUESS WHO YOU'RE CHEATING day traders NOT ME~!  Those taunt threads saying "OHH YOU SHOULD HAVE SOLD" YEAH NO SHIT.  NO SHIT I SHOULD HAVE SOLD.  I SHOULD HAVE SOLD MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY SELL AND BOUGHT MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY BUY BUT YOU KNOW WHAT NOT EVERYBODY IS AS COOL AS YOU.  You only sell in a bear market if you are a good day trader or an illusioned noob.  The people inbetween hold.  In a zero-sum game such as this, traders can only take your money if you sell.
so i've had some whiskey
actually on the bottle it's spelled whisky
sue me
(but only if it's payable in BTC)

This whole subreddit sounds like a bipolar mental clinic. I don’t know if it’s the festive Christmas effect or how misleading this fake mini-pump is...but seeing all the comments in here (particularly the Physicist singing Bitcoin-Christmas tunes)...you guys need to get a grip. Sure, it’s some relief after seeing so much red the past two months and the entire calendar year altogether. But how could you be so duped by what’s been happening this week after being terrorized the past two months of the crypto market losing over half its capitalization going from $230 billion to $100 billion? We’ve recovered a little over $30 billion of that $130 billion and everyone is celebrating like it’s the next bull run. NO, IT’S NOT. This is most likely a one week tiny bull run that could end this week if not tomorrow. The stock market is failing bad so that’s even more an ominous sign that this is the conspicuous pump and dump ever. Get rid of cable, get DirectTV ...no get rid of your Bitcoin stockholm syndrome and be practical. Crypto market is still dead and it will take time before it fully recovers. Don’t be ecstatic about BTC hitting $4K as the new $6K.

Cryptogrip this is when I begin to hate you again. You’ve been great the past few weeks. But when you start talking nonsense saying a lot to really say a little, I hold nothing but resentment for you. Because I can’t even tell if you’re trolling. “I have been thinking around 2025 for some serious gains” like WTF?? Why do you say shit like that. “There’s something about a Bitcoin bull run that just makes stocks and other investments seem boring as fuck.” Why do you talk like a little kid? There’s something about every bull run that makes every dormant asset class boring as fuck. When stocks are soaring (2014-2016), Bitcoin was boring as fuck. I don’t understand your brand of logic. The only way that I can rationalize you is that you’re a master troll. And if you are, please admit it so I can ignore you. If you are not a troll and being sincere, then god have mercy on your soul.

Ohh don’t give me that logarithmic argument.. if you look over the past 7 years Bitcoin is up 1 million % blah blah blah. Cryptogrip are you a history teacher? Well if you are, I don’t want to be your history student. I just think it’s outrageous that you’re calling the start of a bull run after 2 mere days of hardcore pumping by the whales after 2 painful months of dumping. That doesn’t make you credible when you react based on prices. It’s not the start of the next major bull run, get it thru your head.
@_date: 2018-12-20 20:11:09
I predicted Bitcoin will hit $6K between Dec 2018 and Feb. 2019 so I will say my prediction is right. But, I am emphatic that there is no major bull run happening and it is only a short term pump and dump by the whales. In essence, you’re celebrating nothing. You guys have Stockholm syndrome and celebrate the days your abuser does not abuse you as your black swollen eye heals. Pitiful.

BCashBeTrash, in that itty bitty brain of yours, do you ever hear yourself talk, seriously? Do you just drift in and out like Peter Griffin on Family Guy? Why is it with just you BCashBeTrash that LITERALLY everything that you say could be responded with the Billy Madison quote: “what you've just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.”
I know education and rational thought isn’t encouraged where you’re from but for God’s sake, read what you’re about to post. You started by trashing BCash and then speculated some total horse 
crap about the lives of Roger Ver and Craig Wright (neither of whom I care about). I understand you’re not a very intelligent person and that’s okay (neither is cryptogrip) but at least Cryptogrip is capable of talking with sanity. You talk like a mental nut who escaped the local hospital. You are the very reason they created straitjackets; you are a harm to yourself and everyone around you. Try this: get some duct tape and wrap it around your mouth for a week. Don’t even poke a hole in it. Also tape your nostrils too. Good luck to you.

Cryptogrip you’re a pretty rational level-headed person all differences aside. And your first statement is 100% correct - nobody can disagree with that. The stock market took a massive hit today which is ALWAYS AN OMINOUS SIGN FOR BITCOIN. A bad economy and bad stock market will lead to bearish signals for Bitcoin. So, why did today’s crypto market contradict the stock market? Because it is a fool’s pump planned by the whales after the past two horrid months of a bear market. They have been running these bullish signals in the past two months. It’s been a setup for even a greater fall. Small pumps followed by large dumps. That’s how we got from $7K in November to $3K in December. I have no clue what bullish signals you’re referring to - there aren’t any. Are you making that up? For the most part, a poor stock market has correlated to a bad crypto market. The whales planned this small bull run before this stock market crash. The whales can’t predict the stock market. If the stock market did great today, people would create some fake rationale that stock market optimism leads to Bitcoin optimism. I guess it’s a novelty these days to rejoice when you see green - Stockholm Syndrome likewise a rape victim who sympathizes over her attacker.

“They start getting bet” and “you probably tell your wife or girlfriend don’t crying”... English is definitely not your first language because you talk like an illiterate. Obviously, I know you children are very emotional with your Bitcoin instead of being sensible and understand it’s a journey.

Good stat The Physicist even though that bottom really didn’t last long - only a couple of days as I recall. I believe we are now either at the bottom or near the very bottom. I could not see Bitcoin falling below $2100 and I was advising everyone that $6K was not the bottom. Everybody called me FUD. But I won big because I stood behind my beliefs based on historical behavior of Bitcoin. I do believe that if Bitcoin falls again, it will be its final fall. In the longterm, even buying $6K will be very rewarding when Bitcoin hits $190K. When institutional money finally touches Bitcoin or an ETF gets passed, sky is the limit. Bitcoin has actually done phenomenally well considering institutional money has not touched BTC yet albeit all the whale pumping. The global wealth is roughly estimated at $200 trillion and not even a trillion has hit the cryptocurrency market yet let alone Bitcoin. This is the longterm progression that Bitcoin is making. Patience is key.

Cryptogrip called it the start of the next big bull run on Tuesday after seeing a few good days and BTC surpassing $4K. That’s funny. Cryptogrip should be a comedian. It now back under $4K so he’ll probably change his mind or remain stubborn that Bakkt in January 2019 will save BTC. I also find the dummies who believe that Friday was a terrible day because people needed last minute cash to buy Christmas gifts so they sold their BTC. This is why the whales win because they know Bitcoiners are stupid as hell.

Cryptogrip are you drunk? You’re talking like a drunk man. I don’t want to be the Bitcoin cynic but this entire year should make everyone cynical. There is no happy ending to virtually a $730 BILLION DROP over the course of one calendar year. This is not a bull run. It’s a clear pump - I predict between $165 billion and $205 billion range. After this pump, the whales will dump it hard again but I don’t believe it will be much lower than $3.2K. How can you be so optimistic in such turbulent times? Do you have Stockholm syndrome? The whales are playing with the market, nothing more to see.
@_date: 2018-12-04 23:05:07
Bakkt could still come to fruition, I believe the date is Jan. 15, 2019. The whales could use it as a final mini-pump of the year/this bear market. I cannot remotely  see Bakkt resurrecting Bitcoin to its all-time high. The whales could use it as FOMO/optimism to pump Bitcoin. But my biggest question is the economy and stocks? Obviously the economy has been great the past 10 years and is at its own all time highs...and Bitcoin is yet to be tested during a good recession. Surely a recession could fall Bitcoin even further but I genuinely believe it won’t have too much of an impact considering where we are today. Dow Jones fell 900 pts and I predict this will be followed by a massive 5700-point drop in one day occurring some time in 2019 commencing the process of a recession. Right now it is much better to have your money in Bitcoin than the stock market because the stock market has much more to fall than BTC potentially does. In all honesty, I think cash reserves is your best bet until early 2020.

Let’s all celebrate because the whales taketh a lot and the whales giveth a little back... that’s how we went from $20K to $3K. 2018 has been an awful year for crypto nearly reversing all the massive gains of 2017.

BCash has lost 83% of its value in a month - $637 on Nov. 6th...reading $113 today Dec. 6th. Meanwhile, BTC has lost 45% of its value in a single month. What does that mean? Volatility and nothing more. Just like BTC reads $3600, it could read $6700 on Jan. 6th 2018. Then the FUD will be temporarily be gone and people will buy back into BTC. We’re all so distracted by the day to day activities overlooking the bigger picture.

Delusion precedes people after being inundated with so much red candles. These are the growing pains of investing in Bitcoin. To all those people who HODLed between 2014-2016, shout out to them because they were rewarded handsomely. Patience is a virtue. Bitcoin does not rise when you want it at the snap of a finger. It’s a very volatile asset class, one that will experience much more turbulence in the years to come. All you can do is HODL and not pay attention to the current price.
