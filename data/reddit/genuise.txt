yes, but this does not imply that Japanese central bankers ~~know~~ intent this


, especially keeping in mind that their actions such as:


games with zero or even negative interest rate, 
already destroyed much of wealth of the Japanese nation.
That is why I am asking why out of a sudden would Japanese central bankers become vivid proponents of the sound money policies on the upcoming G7 talks? 
I feel that you are mistaken here. Or please give more arguments.

Hi, as you can notice we have an idea to separate bids and asks sides in all our indices. 
In case of trade indices the formula really uses one of the possible variants to calculate the value weighted average price for sells and buys separately too. The main idea for us was to be able to grasp the whole market on it different volume levels. That is why the idea to select among predefined btc volumes 10, 100, 1000, 10000.
allUSD combines all data from all exchanges: orderbooks and trades as if it was a real exchange thus representing the market as a whole.
So in comparison with Winkindex and others which use data only from limited exchanges our allUSD multiple indices can compete even better, keep in mind some potential future advances.
As you can see from the very beginning we had an idea to make our service payable with bitcoin and we sell subscriptions for full access.
Also it would be interesting for us to provide api access using some sort of monetizing too. If you are interested we can discuss this question further.

Thank you for you discussion. You try to pronounce literally what is written in the document. On the other hand my interest is in interpretation and most interesting the interpretation from the legal point of view. As you can see in the article I reference. In this sense it would be good to hypothetise about possible interpretations and implications of those interpretations.
When we use quotes we need to understand that those quotas could mean nothing without legal interpretation. That is why the article interested me. 
In other words the most interesting thing is asking what if questions and thinking aloud about possible consequneces. NExt steps and next interpretations.

Am I correct ? there were still not any transactions completed yet?
I am personally interested in  trying your service and I can accept one of your offers. But the problem is that I still do not lave a light coin wallet and I still have questions about how it is supposed actually to work.
Can you help me to understand. 
my questions are:
1) should both parties deposit the same amount to the risk fund before agrrement? Otherwise how mutual distruction will be enforced?
2) in what sequence releasing/destruction of risk fund is performed exactly?
3) is there any risk of say counter part takes my USD and instead of releasing funds destroys them. How this issiue can be addressed?
thank you

What about second part of the answer? Can tell whether the consolidated orderbook prices match you expectations?
@_date: 2013-05-18 12:49:13
gox USD is priced less and BTC is priced more because of HS blocked their liquidity channel thru dwolla. It is easier to withdraw BTC than USD from gox.
The same effect was while last days of cryptox. The price of BTC was much higher on cryptox because it was not possible to withdraw USD from them.
The same is probably with gox now. It is realtively difficult to withdraw USD now so the price tends to be higher.

Taken from the [article]( 
this example shows us that FinCEN can apply its rulling as it whishes. And even ignore the actual state of affairs. In this case your example can be irrelevant just because FinCEN issued new rulling in March. Which targeted miners - all miners at once cause they were the first and easy target as FinCEN decided they create new coins. Which is itself problematic. 
That is why I want us to dig inside this abstract things and hypothetise about this aspect.

so please correct me
if I want to buy 10 btc from you for my USD I will need to have my own 20 BTC to out into risk fund? right?
and you also have to put 20 btc in the risk fund. and 10 btc to reserve to send to me ? yes/no?
after this is made we can start transaction I send you USD somehow, we wait  and when USD arrive at you account you send 10 btc to my address or release 10 btc on the website and they are sent to me? 
and also we both get back our risk funds of 20 btc each?
please clear this with yes and no if possible :)

I ordered these cards and got them in a matter of 2 weeks. Support was very responsive, athough seemed their english was not always clear for me. I then activated the card and managed to top up the card with 50 euro on saturday evening, card was credited on Sunday. Already payed on POS terminals for groceries and gasoline.
The only my concern is that to activate full mode of the card (enable ATM outside of France) I need to verify wth passport and residence in France for last 3 month which is obviously not the fact cause I have never been to France.

I am addressing interpretation of FinCEN by attorney [here]( She stated defended miners position which by FinCEN rules were MT because they create new coins. And she defended miners saying that they do not create new coins because all coins were created by Satoshi Nakamoto and miners just release them in the process. 
Thus my question is if miners do not create new coins than probably Satoshi Nakamoto did created them and thus by this interpretation has to be MT in this case instead of miners.

BitInstant is not an exchange. BitInstant converts your USD for you on Mtgox.
 provides some kind of analogy index which can represent the average price for the whole USD market, EUR,  CAD, RUR, PLN, GBP etc.
bitcoin-analytics.com maintains consolidated orderbooks of all majore exchanges for the given currency which can be assumed as the one exchange. And then the price for the market is calculated. Also bids and asks prices are maintend separately. Trades are also separated to bids and asks side.
hope this will help

@_date: 2013-08-21 18:32:36
yes in this scenario miners are just users of the software.
The software defines how many coins will be issued. So the developer defines the issuence rules. 
This hypothetically could be next line of attack of the FinCEN. 
For example: Ok if miners are just users they release coins then we need to declare someone else as MT. Accordingly to our previous rulling this those who orginially issued 21M must regester as MT. As Identity of Satoshi is unknown and as Gavin is assumed next Satoshi in a row then he is the only person who has to register as MT.
This can be hypothtical attack form FinCEN side.
Or what is wrong with this logic?

@_date: 2013-08-21 17:02:24
Yes I read their answer. My question is about different argument. They are not involved with actual transfer of money. But they influence money creation algorithm what differs them from miners and thus make them more MT than miners.
