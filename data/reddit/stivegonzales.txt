At that point, I'll sell and buy QBitcoins. I'll make sure to keep my QWallet.dat entangled with Schrödinger's cat.

Thanks a lot folks, for the kind words and support.
What do you want that I send (and how)? Vector, PSD and PNG, or whatever? 
I'll do a 40 height and 48 height PNG with padding and background anyway.

All latest Firefox, Chrome &amp; Opera have websockets disabled.
Nice blank map.

Well spotted. Fixed.

Exact same Chrome version gives me nothing. Curiously, I don't see any Javascript error. FF &amp; Opera both throw a Javascript Exception: WebSocket undefined.

That's more or less what I'm saying. Also; the reward halves every 4 years, while the number of transactions (hopefully) increases at some as-of-now unknown rate. It is of course possible that the  increase in value of BTC will be more than 100% every 4 years. If that's the case then I'd expect the accepted transaction fee to reduce (in BTCs) accordingly, so maybe by the time the reward is less than 1BTC, its value will still be more than 10 minutes of transactions. Who knows; it's kind of complicated, but fun to watch.

The 'Argumentum ab Electricitati' is fallacious since it requires, for it  to be a valid criticism, that all other energy use is necessary, beneficial and more efficient.

I guess all they need to do is track down the company responsible and require them to get a licence. That shouldn't be too h... oh; wait.
@_date: 2011-05-18 13:06:17
It's worth bearing in mind that, in the future, the value of transaction fees in a given time period  is likely (if Bitcoin gains traction) to be much larger than the current 'value' of a block.

I have wallet.dat as a symlink to W:\wallet.dat
w:\wallet.dat  for all practical purposes doesn't exist unless a (small) TrueCrypt volume is mounted on W:
So, I mount whichever one I want to use and then start Bitcoin.
After closing Bitcoin and umounting I can copy that TrueCrypt volume to wherever.

Just for the record, you can do either of those on Win7 / Vista / Server 2008.

If you send me one bitcoin, I'll tell you the answer which you can then sell to a minimum of four friends.

If the number of shoes &gt;= number of heads &gt;= number of people wanting photos it just might work. Of course, it's likely that the government will shut it down before it becomes a serious threat to the shoes-on-feet status-quo.

It is a good point. It isn't however, as the author seems to think, outlining a failure of the system.
If Bitcoin is junk and it fails then so be it; the correct response is to throw it in the fucking bin and walk away. Bitcoin has no authority compelling you to use it even though it has become worthless.

Broadly speaking, yes.
I sent bitcoins and after about an hour got emailed a valid HIB gift code.
Moral: Don't risk more than you can stand to lose, but this worked as advertised.

Well now that you mention it, that's a fair point.
I'd probably feel bad if I hadn't already bought it with real money.

It's like the wild-west early days of 'free software'. It took a long time for those involved to realise that appearance does matter, that people should stick to what they are good at and that they should step-the-fuck-back and let those who actually know how to design, copy-write or whatever do those things.
It is unfortunate, but it's often necessary to be brutal with those who fail to recognise their limitations. The road to hell is paved with good intentions and all that jazz.

Actually, the difficulty worries me, since it favours large centralised processing. Currently these are pools full of anarchic lunatics, but what mechanism is there to prevent some PLC in Switzerland with a bunker full of supercomputers becoming a de-facto central authority? The first step is setting a minimum transaction fee to be worthy of consideration; what next?

It may well be a really fucking stupid idea; data packets representing imaginary wealth.
It is, however, less stupid than bits of paper representing imaginary debt.

According to  which is linked from the bottom of the Bitcoin-Qt download page it's around 6.7GB
For me it's 7.71GB in total.
I assume the discrepancy comes from the various database index files that are created in addition to the block-chain data itself.
A more prominent warning on the download page probably wouldn't be a bad idea, especially these days where it's quite common to have a small SSD system drive.
