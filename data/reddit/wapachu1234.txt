@_date: 2019-01-16 02:20:53
ya his death is related and suspicious as fuck. company owes millions and were suppose to just believe hes passed away probably has a fat life insurance policy which they stole as well as their customers money
@_date: 2019-01-15 03:45:42
quadriga owes millions still has guarantee time frames on site doesnt respond to emails no one even knows where the money is
@_date: 2019-01-15 03:44:30
This so much wait a month to announce the death and also throw on limits and give no update to where our money is
@_date: 2019-01-16 02:22:13
Gerald Cotten would be the biggest low life fucking stealing canadians money then taking it off to india
@_date: 2019-01-16 15:40:12
ya i do and im sick of waiting for my money and being lied to. Its not hard to understand run a honest business people will treat you with respect run a fraud business where you lie to everyone people will treat you how you deserve 
@_date: 2019-01-15 16:51:32
company is still running with their withdrawal GUARANTEE of 7 business days. also if you email support you will either get lied to or a copy pasted message that might not even be relevent. Perfect time to go out of the country while your company owes millions
@_date: 2019-01-16 02:17:17

@_date: 2019-01-16 15:48:38
no people like gerald cotten who run scam exchanges that lie to their customers is why people distrust bitcoin
@_date: 2019-01-16 20:30:50
So he gets married and then goes on his honey moon to India and mysteriously dies I wouldn’t doubt it if his wife had him killed how is this not being investigated
@_date: 2019-01-20 18:32:57

@_date: 2019-01-21 02:41:08

@_date: 2019-01-21 02:40:24
they pay anything lower than 1k to try and suck you in and trust them once you make a bigger withdrawal they are not paying and support doesnt respond the promised my withdrawal 3 months ago and havent paid and it has ruined my life
@_date: 2019-01-16 02:24:12

@_date: 2019-01-17 00:45:51
every time i see the title of this post it pisses me of "We lost a true Bitcoin hero" cant be any further from the truth like 50/50 chance hes still alive or his hooker wife had him killed.
@_date: 2019-01-16 16:21:25
no proof that he even knows gerald cotten. just cause something on the internet doesnt mean its true he didnt prove he even knows him. also gerald cottens company writes lots of things on the internet that are lies
@_date: 2019-01-16 00:38:11
