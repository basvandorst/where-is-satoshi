"I could smash my computer to pieces and still have access to all my bitcoins. They are encrypted and regenerated by a passphrase in my head"
Men with guns can smash brain too, no trouble. 
" I've even used advanced crytpography to split the secret of my bitcoin brainwallet into several shared that certain members of my family, friends, and lawyer hold"
Smash friends and family too. Not exactly secret their identity either, no?

If you buy 10.000 bitcoins you not use them for day to day transactions. Becomes tool for wealthy to hide money, not money for normal person to buy food or petrol.

I do not predict that there are many here to trade with. Thanks for advice though.

This is funny. Few weeks ago ask donation of only 5 bitcoin, people think scamster. Should asked for more.

This shows flaw in human nature. If people donate bitcoin prior to all spectacle, these people remain anonymous and never go to jail. But most refuse donate then, say scamster. Only donate once names known, in news. Apparently want martyrs.

I do not know that this can go far. I am only familiar with it but though I want to use it I can find no way to acquire bitcoins. My paycheque is enough that I spare some for this but where do I buy? Wire fee will cost too much. None left for bitcoin. Until people can get them easily I think not too far at all.

Then it is no use. Only crazy libertarian cranks concerned with reserve federal bank.

What is special about bitcoin? You say things you think special, I point out how unspecial they are.
That is point.

"Bitcoin that you seem to be missing or don't care about. For example, Bitcoins cannot be frozen or blocked."
With no anonymity of course can be blocked. Merely send police to house, shoot moneyholder in legs and tell to crawl away from computer.
Bitcoins no longer spendable.

Not all places in world are like New York City or Los Angles, friend.

Why? Donaters have no need of anonymous. Perfectly safe, legal.

Avoid Paypal? Write cheque. Lick stamp. Mail.
