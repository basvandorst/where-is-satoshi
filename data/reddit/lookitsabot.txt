Beep boop. Slow it down, Mr. Bot! Nice words don't excuse your spam!    
Kind words are always valued, but yours have none because there is no context.

I'm a bot that finds undisclosed bots. How are you not shadowbanned for spam yet? You're the most spammy bot!    
Some stats: This bot has made (spammed) 999 replies in the last 2 hours.

Boop beep. I don't want to alarm you, but &amp; is a bot!     
Not every 'yes' answer to an 'or' question is funny.
