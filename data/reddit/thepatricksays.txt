Sure, right here:
1) Open a new google sheet, click Add-Ons, then Get Add-Ons, and get GOOGLEFINANCE. (EDIT: This may not be required)
2) =GoogleFinance("CURRENCY:BTCUSD") in a cell will get you the current BTC/USD value. I'm afraid I don't know how to convert to other currencies but this should be a quick search away.
3) Put the total amount of BTC you own in another cell, then use =PRODUCT(cell1, cell2) to get your current fiat value. This will update everytime GoogleFinance updates (I think 10 minutes)
4) 30-Day Performance: =GOOGLEFINANCE("BTCUSD","Close",TODAY() - 30,TODAY(),"Daily") 
Stick that in a cell and you'll get a vertical list of the past 30 days of BTC values to USD at 11:59:29 PM (I do not know what TZ this is) that day. 
5) =SPARKLINE(GOOGLEFINANCE("BTCUSD","Close",TODAY() - 30,TODAY(),"Daily")) will give you an unlabelled graph showing the same values as  This graph will fit a single cell - I've expanded mine to fit a 4x4 space right beside the listing.
6) Individual BTC Performance: Create a row that shows the USD spent on each individual BTC purchase, the value at the time it was purchased, and the value today. You can create a sparkline that will integrate the purchased value and the last 30 days to get a measure of the performance.
That's pretty much everything I'm doing. Put all that together and you'll have yourself a personalized BTC monitor. 
EDIT: A quick note about coloring cells - if you want cells to appear either green or red for positive or negative balances, right click the cell and choose "Conditional Formatting." Keep it on Single Color and pick "Greater than" from the dropdown menu. Enter 0 and use either the dropdown marked Default, or the paint bucket (depending if you've styled the cell otherwise), to set a green color. Add another rule, this time use "Less than" and again enter a 0. Choose a red color and press Done. 
This will now automatically color the cell red or green if you're in positive or negative.

Make yourself a Google Sheet to track your investment. Utilize the GoogleFinance add-in to get live BTC/USD values, and crunch that into a simple tracker for yourself.
Then, go mad adding sparklines, colors, 30-day trackers, individual performance charts for each BTC purchase, and other fun data. GDAX is fun, but monitoring your own little BTC finance sheet is REALLY fun.
