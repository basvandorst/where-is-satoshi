... If someone has been here for 1 hour, you can't assume they **aren't** a 60 year old genius devoted to whatever topic they're commenting on.
It is anonymous after all. 
EDIT: The fact that I have to explain this to someone who has been here for 7 years is just GOLD!!

And that information is good for... What exactly? 
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:39:25
Of course it does, theres no actual information to be gained from how long someone has been on this site. It doesn't tell you how old the person is, what their experiences are, what they've studied, what their biases are, or even how well they know reddit apparently. 
People can lurk for years before making an account, people can buy older accounts with higher karma scores, people can keep deleting all of their posts after they've been up a week to leave no history. 
Its anonymous, the age of the account means nothing.
EDIT: Thats r/ASKthe_donald  actually, forgive me for trying to commune with those not of like-mind

Well yes but not by virtue of your account age, I believe anyone using an anonymous website should keep in mind that they have no real way of knowing who is beyond the screen. 
I did not assume you knew these things because you have an older account, but because you have an account at all.

How on Earth does that prove the point? If anything it further proves that there's nothing to be gained from knowing someones account age. 
EDIT: Also, where the hell does it say I'm subbed to T_D? I havent been there in ages and I'm tagged non-trumper everywhere I go

Because its ironic that someone with a long account age thinks there is anything to be gained from how long an account has existed. You should know by default what an anonymous site is about, the fact that you don't after 7 years just **adds** to the hilarity. 
It would merely be chuckle worthy if your account was a week old, but it would still be just as wrong.
