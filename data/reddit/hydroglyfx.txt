The dip started earlier than the article. This just accelerated it. Plus, it’s still fraud.
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:01:04
Still does not change that most of the public did not know about it. This month alone, tether has added at least 700 million tether...which is supposed to be back by USD. I doubt they made $700 million in Janauary.
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:26:28
But those other coins don’t claims to back their coin at a 1:1 ration to USD. Tether is supposed to be the crypto equivalent of USD. They literally have a Tether printing press in which they have put out 100 million tether 7 times in January. Other Cryptos will fluctuate and the parent company doesn’t need that capital to back the coin, this is something unique to Tether. Tether themselves keep the price as close to 1USDT=1USD. They say they do this on purpose and are able to because they actually have that ratio in USD. So now that they have 2.3 Billion Tether available, they MUST have $2.3 USD to back that. If they don’t, it’s fraud.

That still brings them to court... and if they actually had the money, why would they cancel their audit?
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:54:48
Just go look at the circulating supply...
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:32:19
That is literally Tether’s purpose...and they’ve put out 600 million tether in the last 3 weeks. So they’ve essentially printed $600 million dollars. They claim they can back 1 USDT to 1 USD. If they can’t actually do that, then they are printing cash out of thin air that they could exchange for another Crypto. Then, sell that Crypto for real USD on another exchange.

That’s what I’m wondering.

Binance is my personal favorite.
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:26:39
He posted the same thing in r/litecoin and r/ethereum as well.
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:36:40
You’ve clearly never actually criticized somebody face to face for how they spend their money. If you had, you would have gotten a resounding “fuck-off” because you have no right in determining what is a valid expense for somebody else.

I expect 100% gains per minute damnit! My $50 of bitcorn need to be 1,000,000 by tomorrow!
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:15:43
People like you are exactly why I’m glad I got out of bitcoin. Condescending and smug.

It really is...if you don’t buy a dog from a shelter instead of a pet shop/breeder, then you’re an asshole. That is literally gatekeeping.
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:28:37
You’re right! I blame my hangover...Without knowing the Hz, 144 fps kinda means nothing. I can run 200+ fps on a 60 Hz  but that 200fps looks way better on 144 Hz. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:29:54
1440p @ 144fps please.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:19:30
It’s bullshit.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:17:19
So did Mars!
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:23:43
Exactly. He’s saying that its purposely being manipulated to fit the episode. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:09:55
You’re no fun
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:21:25
This is the only answer.
@_date: 2017-10-27 14:37:49
You too, old man.
@_date: 2017-10-22 13:06:26
I just realized how truly envious I am of people who receive money from family to help kick start their lives. Props to him choosing to invest in BTC at such a young age.
@_date: 2017-10-27 19:44:06
I love how you both assumed I was angry. You obviously both project your own typical emotions.
@_date: 2017-10-27 13:47:10
Then you’ve missed what I’ve been trying to convey this entire time. 
Here: 
ENJOYING THE MISERY OF OTHERS IS CHILDISH. NORMAL FUNCTIONING ADULTS APPRECIATE THE SUCCESS OF OTHERS. SHARING SUCCESS IS THE FOUNDATION OF A SUCCESSFUL SOCIETY. 
Does that help? 
@_date: 2017-10-27 14:12:26
Typical response of somebody that lives in fear. Cast judgement of everyone but refuse to reflect on yourself. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 13:20:53
Yessir! Small atomic steps before I can walk on the moon.
@_date: 2017-10-27 13:42:29
Yeah, you’re right. I stooped to your level and you beat me with experience. Congratulations.
@_date: 2017-10-27 13:32:22
Jesus, how big is your neckbeard? Let me guess, your intelligence is far too superior for the common man to understand. You’ve pondered life more than I and evaluated human nature further than I thought possible.
Go socialize, realize that it’s not normal for people to get pleasure from the misfortune of others. Those that do receive pleasure from that are usually avoided because they are sociopaths.
@_date: 2017-10-27 13:36:07
That’s all you were looking for, a win? Christ dude, you can have it if that’s what you were looking for. Enjoy your lonely, depressing life of enjoying the misery of others. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 13:15:24
And he just told me to float down to Earth. Haha
@_date: 2017-10-27 13:22:02
I do the same thing, I just don’t find pleasure in seeing somebody do worse than myself. That’s literally how children behave. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 14:01:04
Funny assumptions, now let me make some of my own. 
What it sounds like to me is that you’re a terrible judge of character and have been blind sided by people that you should never have been associating with. Sharing success is the very thing that makes our economy grow. Yes, one man may be at the top, but that success is always shared. 
My view of the world comes from my personal experiences in the workplace, with business associates, friends, and family. Watching all of these people succeed gives me inspiration to succeed further than I already have.
You’re view of the world probably comes as a middle aged man that’s never taken risks and lives in a very confined area of comfort. You never reach outside your comfort zone because you are afraid to fail. That’s why you enjoy watching others fail...because you think of them as dumb for taking the risk. 
But like you said...you don’t care, that’s why you keep responding. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 14:24:23
You’re afraid.
@_date: 2017-10-27 13:08:20
Literally said its less than admirable and a bit petty, but it’s normal. Okay.
@_date: 2017-10-27 13:15:39
You have the mindset of a child.
