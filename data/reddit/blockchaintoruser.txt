Im all about personal responsibility.  I like to assess my own risks, make my own decisions, and live with the consequences of those decisions. Im not going to get my money stolen, but if i did then i wouldn't come here to complain about it.
As i said in another post, ive been using the site over tor for over 2 years and had no problems.

Hackers cant use tor to compromise accounts, users compromise their own credentials when they connect over an insecure (http) connection. 
The "hackers" can still use the account credentials they have previously farmed to steal the funds of people who have connected over http connections.  The only reason (i can think of) that blockchain.info would shut down tor connections to the wallet is to prevent more people from foolishly connecting via http and disclosing their own wallet info to a malicious exit node. 
The button to proceed is for users who know what they are doing and want to assume the responsibility/risk.  If someone doesnt know what they are doing, and they click the big red proceed button we proposed, then they really can only blame themselves for the loss of funds.  I would argue that people only have themselves to blame for loss of funds in general, even without a formal warning from blockchain.info.
It sucks when i cant move my funds because the system is blocking tor IP's because other mywallet users are being foolish with their money and are uneducated about the systems they are using.
Cant wait to start using the new blockchain.info .onion address !

Thanks, I already do VPN &gt; tor to block my ISP from seeing i connect to tor.  I guess i could do VPN &gt; tor &gt; VPN just to acess my web wallet with a non-tor IP but it seems like an unnecessary amount of work and cost considering that i have been using by blockchain.info web wallet for over 2 years without issue connecting over tor.

Yes, i do have a copy and i know i could restore my wallet from that backup.  The title of this thread is sensationalist, but it is a major inconvenience for people like myself.

I agree 100%, give the user the option to risk it after acknowledging they understand.  I hope this is changed soon or i am going to have to restore my funds from a downloaded backup.

I created a thread about this earlier and someone from blockchain.info said they were working on getting a .onion up soon.
Blockchain isnt hacked, users who lost funds are connecting via MITM http connections from malicious exit nodes.  Im using the latest version of tor and when a SSL certificate is bad there is a big yellow exclamation point on the screen telling you that the connection cant be trusted.  I have been using the blockchain webwallet over tor for over 2 years and i have never lost a single satoshi.  
The only people who are losing funds are people who dont understand the technology they are using.  There are pleny of tools (2FA) and information available to prevent the loss of funds.  
The title is sensationalist, but the problem is real.  I want to move my funds but all tor IP's are banned.  That sucks.
