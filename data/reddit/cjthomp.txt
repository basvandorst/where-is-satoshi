It also loses good money.

Potential, in money as with people, isn't worth shit. Every stock could *potentially* skyrocket due to some future event, every child could *potentially* not be a complete fuckup; the odds are bad for both, though.

An article talking about the rising use of btc in the porn industry?

How's a computer to know the difference between a large number like `150,324,252` and three different numbers `150 324 252`?
