Literally hundreds of thousands of companies care about you. Not the same way as your family and friends do. But they see you as a consumer. They track you. When they track you, they manipulate you. When they manipulate you, they take away your freedom of thoughts and freedom of individuality. 
You seem to have a childish notion of things. There's no list. There are lists. You belong to many many lists. The more list you belong to and the more you are tracked, the more you fit into a model. And that model can be nudge with variables. Facebook tracked people of particular types. Russians took those tracked people and applied some nudged variables. That caused them to elect Trump. This is one example of how tracking being used. 
But forget all of that. Privacy is a person's inalienable rights. You shouldn't laugh at people who are working to keep as much of it possible. Supposedly you don't care about your privacy. Can you i have your social security number then? Perhaps your date of birth and mothers maiden name? Oh why beat around the bush, just give us your userid and password on any 2fa you have for your bank account.

Its so strange to see bitcoin being discussed in mainstream media with straight face and all seriousness.

Iraq had nothing to do with 9/11. Heck Saudi Arabia had more to do with 9/11 than any other country including Afghanistan. The only reason Afghanistan got invaded is because it wouldn't hand over Osama bin Laden without proof of his involvement to 9/11. 


That's stupid. George W Bush wasn't an infant or a school boy when he became president. I wouldn't have gone to war because he has vendetta against Saddam. Nor could he have convinced 40\+ countries to go along with him. Do you think UK and AU and others would have been like "Sure, buddy, let's go to war because you have rage against Saddam." Nah. This isn't plausible and it's not true. I'm glad you don't believe this shit. 
The only think that make sense is protection of petrodollar. Obviously nobody's going to admit it who were involved with the Iraq war. But that's why Iraq was invaded. About 30 years from now, documents would declassified that would verify this.

Peter Thiel is an evil person because he used his wealth to shutdown a media/journalism website. You may have whatever opinion of Gawker but anyone who uses their wealth and clout to shut down journalism is an evil person. Besides Gawker was refreshing. They had snarking reporting and usually weren't afraid to report things they reported. This isn't where Mr Thiel's evilness ends. 
Peter Thiel is runs  Palantir Technologies, the company that is responsible for spying on millions and millions of Americans and probably billions of human beings across the world. He and his company and his employees are also involved with Cambridge Analytica which use subversive technique to manipulate not only American election but election across the world. 
Peter Thiel doesn't pay his fair share of tax despite being billionaires. The companies he founded\-those that he ran  or is running\-\-don't pay proper amount of taxes. They use loopholes. Not only that Peter Thiel denounced his US citizenship by accepting NZ citizenship. He gained it just after 12 days from NZ. So either NZ sells its citizenship or he used some shadowy ways to get it. He currently maintains multiple citizenship which he surely uses for tax avoidance. 
From there on out, he becomes more kooky. He wants to form some sort of sea based country of sorts where he's away from all laws and regulations. He is funding research to become immortal. 
Reportedly he's homosexuals. Being a homosexual these days, especially in position of influence, means you are sort of an advocate for minority rights. Despite being very close to D\_T, he said nothing to protest D\_T's Muslim Ban. Nor did he speak out out when D\_T spoke ill ways about women, Mexicans, Africans, liberals. etc. He remained in D\_T's council of some sorts and didn't step down in a public manner. 
And he's Libertarians\-\-more kooky than Republicans and these group of people sit between extremist Republicans and truly fanatical fascism/alt\-right.

I use bank every single day. Banks make it possible for me to enjoy my life. They make it possible to literally have a roof over my head. I could never buy a house for cash. Banks took a risk on me and gave me a loan so I could buy the house and provide shelter for my family. I can't begin to write down all the positive things that banking has made possible. Banks will still be here even if bitcoin replaces all currency. Heck I bought some bitcoin. Guess what I had to use to buy? Banks. Needed to wire money through banks to some one who'd sell me bitcoin.

No. Tin Foil necessary. Just before the 2003 invasion, Saddam was accepting EURO for payments. This isn't make up. This is fact. Soon as he started doing that, false charges against Iraq was made and a sovereign nation was invaded... to protect petrodollar. It wasn't about WMD \(which were fake\), it wasn't about Saddam being a dictator. It certain wasn't about Iraqi people's well being. As the invasion and subsequent rise of ISIS cause irreparable harm to Iraqi people than would have happened if Iraq wasn't invaded.

This kind of talks are delusional especially when you are in a stable western economy. USD  and EURO, to some extent Yuan, Yen, and few other cartoon country money aren't going anywhere anytime soon.  I suspect people who want everyone to get all into bitcoin have gotten into bitcoin when it was just few dollars or few cents. They just want mad rush of people to get into bitcoin and raise its value. So these 'early adopters' can cash out and GTFO. 
I have \(not enough\) bitcoin. And i want go get rich with that. But I'd rather it not be by leaving fellow human beings with the empty basket . I want all of us to prosper. And that is going to happen in bitcoin through organic, natural, and at times bursts adoptions and new users. Let's all promote bitcoin on its own merit. It's truly a decentralized and deflationary digital cash. It's resilient to censor. It's resilient to China, USA, EU, India and lets not even mention any other country trying to fight it. Year over year it has grained in value. Though it seems to be stabilizing now and not really doing anymore of the wild swings. 
Don't tell people to make financial decisions in absolute terms online. Someone could take your advice and end up with nothing. Remember all the bitconnect people? Always invest in anything be it cash or bitcoin or gold responsibly and within the conform of your risk affinity.

Only if it's bitcoin. It won't prove extreme immutability for anything else. My city is thinking about using blockchain for property title. Sounds pretty fucking awesome. Until you realize that they are basically going to be using one city node. Meaning the property department will have a server/computer mining for blocks to move or add new titles around. If it's one computer/node doing it, why not just put it in Excel document. You get no benefit of bitcoin type immutability. 
They talked about how they will let people outside like me and you mine and unlock blocks. But why would we use our computer and electricity to mine for this property title blockchain? What's our reward?  They can't give us 12.5 property for blocks we unlock. We can't take a portion of people's property when we put their title in our blocks. They can pay us cash to unlock blocks and move title around. But how's that any different than paying Amazon to host the data in AWS or Oracle or Microsoft or HP or Dell? 
As I said, blockchain only makes sense for bitcoin. Bitcoin only makes sense on blockchain. For anything else blockchain is a really shitty database system. Even CSV file would be better.

If China converts its entire Yuan to crypto and has sole power to mine/confirm it, then it's not really a decentralized cryptocurrency. Bitcoin will remain the only decentralized cryptocurrency. Nothing else will ever be like bitcoin. Because the 2000\+ crypto that exists today all have a known creator. Bitcoin doesn't. You might say Satoshi. But Satoshi is a concept. It's not a person. Mining/confirming bitcoin is decentralized.  
Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency that works. And blockchain only works for bitcoin. Bitcoin only works for blockchain.

Compared to other currencies. EURO will stabilized more once OPEC starts using it. That's the whole reason US went to war with Iraq is to prevent OPEC from dumping USD and using EURO. Iraq started to use EURO and bam it gets invaded under false trumped up WMD charges. I believe one of your own, Roger Ver, cried about 500000 dead iraq children.

It's not poor communication or paranoia or lack of knowledge that makes people say this. People say it because he did to evil things. It is as clear as black and white. There is no doubt in this. 
Peter Thiel used his considerable wealth to shut down Gawker\-a media/news company. That is pure EVIL. 
Peter Thiel uses his considerable wealth and influence to rails against public schools and institution. That is pure EVIL.
Peter Thiel considers women's suffrage a historical mistake. That is pure EVIL. 
Peter Thiel wants to form a "nation" in ocean so he can avoid paying taxes and avoid being held accountable to laws and rules of nations. That is pure EVIL.
Peter Thiel's company helps spy on all Americans and probably billions of human being from around the world. That is pure EVIL.
Peter Thiel hates American laws and regulations. But he hates FDA more than any other. This fucker wants American to have not food or drug safety. This is pure EVIL. 
Peter Thiel is in bed with Trump. 
And this motherfucker wants to live forever. He believe death isn't inevitable. This belief doesn't make him evil but it makes him seem like a cartoonish village.

You are looking at this through an extremely narrow and selfish point of people. Many people bought it at higher price than it is now. They are bleeding money. But coin was supposed to go to $30000 by now..It's no where near there. Thanks to nerds with no economic knowledge, in-figting among bitcoin groups, and ultimately because of futures market where people can bey against bitcoin. This keeps the price down and repressed. This is how things will be for years. Bitcoin will go to ATH in about 5 years. There will be no mooning. Everyone who bought high can sell low and lose money. Or wait years to cut their loses.
Should have stick with index funds. And never should have invested what they couldn't lose.

We went from ending banking to being happy about banking. The more I see crypto people for what they are the more I realize how much of a big massive ponzi scheme this is. This is saying something as I was and still sort of a massive fan of the concept of crypto. We changed. Changed too much. And now I don't like us. People will top make money and people like I us will willingly give out cash to ponzi masters. Sad.
Still not selling what I have. My fiat that I used to buy btc is gone. And in the off chance that btc does go somewhere in 4\-5 years, I won't kick myself because I folded. What I have is what I have. No more. No less.

Visa serve hundreds of countries and billions of transactions.  All network goes down sometimes. Nobody can guarantee  100% uptime except Allah. Therefore  using this isolated cases of visa network failing in a specific geographic  location doesn't mean bitcoin is better.  Bitcoin too can stop working in isolated specific geographic location. Internet can be cut off in a city or country.  Booboo. No bitcoin transaction for this area. Better have some fiat handy when that happens to either Visa or Bitcoin.

Yeah. Sure. That's what a few of us still cling on to. But as time goes, we are made more aware that this isn't going to happen. I'd be happy with bitcoin replacing the likes of Western Union and Moneygram. But there's virtually zero *marketing* to immigrant groups in terms of remittance. And a whole lot of remit\-into countries are repressive have banned bitcoin and made it illegal to even have bitcoin wallet/traffic. So not much progress is going to be made there. But hey, I can pay for my VPN with bitcoin. That's something.

What is *processing payment* in bitcoin world? It starts with you forming your transaction and broadcasting it to you node. If you can't do that, *processing the payment* can't even start. IMO *processing payment* in bitcoin is mining nodes discovering your transactions from mempool and then deciding to include it in their mined block. 
@_date: 2018-06-01 17:25:16
Replace internet with any network used by bitcoin  to broadcast transaction.  My comment still stands.  Any and all network are prone to going down  sometimes. And nobody can guarantee  100% uptime of any network be it internet or anything else.

What kind of moron are you? If everyone does what you are going to do, then all money/btc will be gone in few generation. And taxation isn't theft. You enjoy the quality of life, roads, safety, security, etc because you pay taxes and the government uses that taxes to provide all those things. Taken to extreme, it seems like you don't want any sort of government. So who builds the fucking internet that you need to use your btc? I use to think bitcoin people were smart and humane. But you fuckers are all Roger Vers and Jihan Wu. Greedy fucks with lunatic belief system. You don't fucking care about anything. All you care about is yourself and not even your own family members. If I wasn't invested in btc, I would sincerely hope it fails to shit so you all lose all of your money as punishment. Seriously there's some sort of contentious mental illness that's very common among and .

I can't wait till LN.BTC becomes as easy to use as using BTC on apps like Jaxx. I've have had issues with Jaxx. But in the beginning when I was just starting out using Jaxx, it was so simple to use. I could install it on someone's phone. Send them a $1 in BTC and then let them transfer it back to me. It was really a joy. Using LN is cumbersome. For now. We need simplistic app that makes using LN transparent to users. And brings back the joy of using crypto again. I have high hopes.

I like how you are trying to be diplomatic and seem like we aren't brigading. But let's take a moment and go through this. What is phishing? You probably have gotten an email from your bank. It looks very professional, it's got the right logo, right spelling,  right everything. But you don't realize that the email came from  Normally your email comes from  \(letter of vs. number zero\). And that email asks you to sign in from the link to verify your contact information. You don't have time to research where the email came from. it looks legitimate. So you do what it asks and now some scammer has your login info to Bank of America. 
Bitcoin\[.\]com is just like that. It's looks professional. It has the right logo. It's makes you think you are getting bitcoin and reading about bitcoin. But nope, it's really Bcash. But you as a new user don't know the difference. You saw on CNN Bitcoin is climbing and it's at **OVER 9000**  and you come to google and search for bitcoin and Bitcoin\[.\]com  and you go buy bitcoin for $1000. You dont know any better. But Bitcoin moons and altcoins tanks. You lost money. This is classic, textbook example of phishing attack. So yeah, you wouldn't be making shit up by reporting bitcoin\[.\]com as a phishing website. You'd be doing the right thing. 
So no this isn't brigade. And let see that, how diplomatic people on are as you see how tries to be moderate and diplomatic. Bitcoin brings out good in people. Abandon your altcoin and come join bitcoin any day. Nobody owns bitcoin and you don't need permission for us to come back to bitcoin, unless all other shitcoins who have owners and CEO and known forkers like Jihan and Ver who will always act in their self interest. These people are opportunists that are out to steal your money and make you cry.

Even if you get a new one, you should always flash it from ledger github. And generate several version on the seed and test recovering with small btv..Once you are comfortable with the recovery process, then create a seed with passphrase. And put your main money in it. But I'd spread it across few passphrases. Don't make the pass phrase from BIP list. Don't make it something obvious like your mother's name. Pick something you will remember easily buy not guessed about you obviously. 
Try not to connect to internet with you ledger. Once it has btc in it it's literally your cash
