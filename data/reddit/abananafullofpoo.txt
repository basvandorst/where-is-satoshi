What utter nonsense you speak. Bitcoin core, used by 99% of users, can't fork itself. Whether it's faced with the threat of a gigantic POW mine in communist China, or a vulnerability in the algorithm.

You're coming from a shit subreddit called rbtc, that has a history of not understanding decentralization and whining about bitcoin maximalism. 2x is an attack on bitcoin by centralized patented mining, and all your devs are shit, both when they're crowdfunding scammy improvements through ICOs and when they're not.
@_date: 2017-09-22 18:09:44

''Economic conduct'' is violence personified. Hence why it requires proof of work. It's also a good part of why there's state and corporate oppression. Look, buddy, words don't automagically fit on your precise position on the political spectrum and excuse you from the ravages of history.

Armstrong the coinbase CEO loves ethereum and its ICOs. He thinks it's decentralized, ironically he believes in Proof-of-Vitalik and Proof-of-Bitmain. You don't think shapeshift peddles altcoins and ICOs and that they're not a vector of attack on bitcoin maximalism? Last I heard of bitpay was it was bankrupt and bailed out by bitmain.
Andresen was busy praising Vitalik's number of nodes in 2016, and has now conveniently switched to saying nodes don't matter. He might have done a lot of minor commits (that needed correcting) but he is definitely the subset dev with a subset vision for bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-09-27 16:21:25


As the wayniloans kerfuffle laid bare, they were lied saying it would have dev support. Not just a ''subset of devs'', but the ones that have contributed to the code that's run by everyone, Hearn and Gavin never did anything btw. The rest are only miners and exchanges either linked to the miners or like shapeshift, coinbase and bitpay that already had a history of anti-bitcoin maximalism, a pro-ICO vibe going for them or a dislike of competing second layer solutions.

Wow. Ableism from an anti-racist. That's what happens when you don't get the latest update from the virtue-signalling gang.
But I'll humor you a bit, then; Jihancoin, chinacoin and shitcoin are all good points because if a coin caves in to nationalistic centralization, let alone to [brutal regimes and cultures like china]( then it's failed. And if bcash wants to set up paypal 2.0 in Shenzhen, I think I'll stay with paypal thanks.

All I'm saying is the right doesn't escape very similar pitfalls that the savage left falls into.

It certainly is a threat. And it turns to 32mb in 2019. Plus all of Jihan's devs are shit. And miner centralization is tragedy of the commons, they don't realize they're going against the ecosystem's economic incentives because they're too self-absorbed.
@_date: 2017-10-07 00:57:30
Another thing that's explicit was the time at bitcointalk Satoshi shut Garzik down when he tried to get rid of the 1mb limit. Also, back then it was easy to mix nodes and miners, as CPU power is ambiguous and considers, rightly so, asic mining as a threat. And not even the bcash camp care about the difficulty rhetoric these days, as they lowered it to keep mining.

@_date: 2017-09-27 15:23:10
I just mean I for one and I expect most sane users to not consider core to be the airdrop minority chain. I expect sane users to follow the devs and then the price and then the miners to follow. I don't expect anyone to develop a POW fetish. I don't like people like Jihan, Vorhees and Ver who think they're so popular that they're accepted on centralized level. Bitcoin needs a balance of powers, innovation and decentralization they don't provide.
@_date: 2017-10-10 08:26:10
The place you got your talking point from, went on to say that bcash was the real bitcoin, and ceased to care that it wasn't the longest chain, even when it tried lowering the difficulty to mine faster.

The reality is over at the cesspool of a subreddit you come from, they praise centralized KYC shitcoins like ripple, paypal, visa and ethereum and premined Proof of Masternode Stake garbage like dash. Otherwise it would be hard to explain all the reposts about coin market share cap drop, even if we do factor in the reality that it's Jihan's that's been blocking a capacity increase. Another one was Craig Wright, who in his clownish performance the other day, admitted to spamming the blockchain with his turing complete useless nonsense bot.
@_date: 2017-07-15 00:51:49
Why even bother vomiting such a retarded talking point when litecoin's blocks are empty?
@_date: 2017-07-08 14:43:40
Visa, paypal, ethereum, ripple, are all coins admired by Jihan and Ver as you often say the market cap share of bitcoin has fallen to them in the last year. But they're all worthless and it's sad you don't see it. In striving to make bitcoin a paypal with an extra algorithm you're not aware of the history of liberty dollars, egolds and liberty reserves that made bitcoin valuable.
Torrents wouldn't have spread had they started at 75$ a year seed boxes, had they been stuck in a severely censored internet like Antpool's chinese internet. In fact torrents are dwindling as the U.S. extends its laws worldwide.
And if you want a centralized datacenter coin, which you'll never get as you'll be regulated out of existence, you'll either have to go to absurd sizes like 30 gb every 10 minute to serve the entire planet, or you'll have to resort to second layers,  in which case, instead of firing them, you'll be begging core to come back, or you'll be frantically trying to put in imitations of core code.
@_date: 2017-07-08 04:06:09
Proof of the Stake they put in Mining is always peddled by Jihad and Vermin as evidence that their say is more important than that of the devs. It makes sense in a way, in the sense that they have no decentralized values and love centralized proof of stake shitcoins.
@_date: 2017-07-08 11:47:35


Miners only verify. Miners are part of an ecosystem. Miners are easily replaceable. Hash merely follows price. Light unbloated blockchains, with more people storing the blockchain, hence more decentralized, are far far more valuable than datacenter coin. No one ever in forever has looked to a miner to disrupt or decentralize. No one in forever thinks that a hash algorithm for a datacenter coin is more valuable than a redundantly stored blockchain.
People like Roger Ver lose elections, they don't get voted into office, and are easily regulated out of existence. That's why light blockchains are necessary.
@_date: 2017-07-13 03:36:27
And what they gonna do. Refuse to give coins from a split to the clients? Say Proof of Vitalikthereum is wonderful because of the whizz-kid but that [the bitcoin-devs all mysteriously disappeared]( Third parties that weren't invested controlled or bailed out by Ver or Bitmain came out in support of 148, such as Electrum, Mycelium or Samourai... Third parties are suspect anyways, as segwit1x is what's trying to get the [80% of transactions that are already off-chain to return on-chain](

You're already whining about cheap fees (to pay coffee with?) on segwit will be too cheap because the market loves utxo bloat. It'll be funny seeing you make the case that segwit is getting spammed on purpose (by who? by AXA and Bilderberg, as opposed to Bitmain?). You don't want capacity increase or users, you want centralization and latency because Jihan says fuck me daddy. In any case, this thread was a thorough debunking of so many of the rbtc lies.
@_date: 2017-07-07 08:48:39


Yes, because it runs on consensus, centralized consensus. Decentralized shit runs shit irreversibly because it runs on decentralized consensus. And how can consensus be a mining algorithm on its own, that's almost as loony as saying price follows mining hash power. Also at the sub you love, they frequently whine about market cap cryptodrop for bitcoin. And yet look at all the centralized turds the dollars are supposedly flowing away to.


You keep going on about how miner stake is all that matters. I'm pulling it out of Jihan's ass.
@_date: 2017-07-07 02:49:09


Tell that to paypal.


Nothing at stake issue. Monopoly stakers are free to impose their rules and/or bet on different stakecoins by threatening other stakecoins
@_date: 2017-07-08 02:54:58


Paypal reverses payments because it's centralized consensus. Capisci? Miners can't code for shit and don't understand nor care for decentralization. Miners are prone to centralize if left unchecked, just like proof of stake.
@_date: 2017-07-14 08:29:40


How in the shit is the aussie moron right if any home pc is far closer to a raspberry pi than to a 20,000$ node in terms of people holding it aka decentralization, in terms of cost, in terms of bandwidth, in terms of capacity to hold bigger blocks... well in any term whatsoever.

No you said they were the three pillars. Right from the rbtc script.


Bitfury did a test
95% non-mining nodes disappear at 8m. Or should I say 8x. Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm so suspicious................
And all of the JihanVer camp have always said non-mining nodes aren't nodes and that they're worthless. It's really Occam's razor, none of you understand nor care for decentralization.


Utter cockslop. Visa and Mastercard have increased adoption. And guess what, they're worthless.

At least under segwit and not under segwit8x, miners are less centralized and have it harder to spam themselves to cause a panic for bigger blocks and force other pools and nodes off the network. Plus the increase from real segwit was already a compromise, the 8x part is a creepy attempt at taking over the protocol.


Decentralization is indeed a static for the purpose of our conversation, one that chinacoiners have over and over again shown to not care an inkling about. Andreas talked about it recently 


You're delusional if you think more users is a bad thing just because other services have more users.
VISA has literally been the measuring stick since bitcoin's inception.
You're the one that alludes to Visacoin as a measure of success.
You're the delusional one if you think Visa is something bitcoin should be aspiring to. Visa a political thing that bitcoin can never be. It's a proof of stake system. It has nothing to do with bitcoin. It is a distant second layer, thoroughly controlled too. Most of bitcoin transactions these days are already on second layers, the soft fork proposed by devs which they were too generous to ask miners for consensus about, was a way of trying to bring those transactions back into bitcoin, not away from bitcoin. The first layer must be decentralized, the other ones, sidechains, drivechains, second layers etc can be experimented with different layers of bloat and centralization. What an obscenity it is on every level to support the takeover attempt from asic miners.

@_date: 2017-07-07 01:06:23
The only use of it is irreversible payments and a gold standard that backs all the shit of the world up. Consensus doesn't achieve that, decentralization does. Besides you're not pro-consensus, you're just pro asic miner asicboost centralized craphole algorithm consensus. That isn't consensus just like the myth that price follows hash is a myth. Just like Moore's law is a fail, you won't be seeing price double every time some chinese schmuck makes a new asic. Code is consensus. What you're advocating is proof of stake, which is a fail precisely because unlike mining power, stake consensus can't be usurped.

Without miners, the code is nothing. Remember that.
You miners don't even hold bitcoin lol. Who the hell do you think you are!!


You have no idea what that means, yet you keep using it.

You 8xers are such creeps.
@_date: 2017-07-08 03:16:59


If torrents had stayed stuck at napster level they never would have grown. There's plenty need to run and keep redundant nodes at cheap prices, and 75 dollars a year isn't cheap, for the HDD, not to mention the bandwidth which is probably way more expensive than 75 bucks. How can you not see the political dangers of centralization is beyond me.
