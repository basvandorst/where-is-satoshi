Yep! As Andreas said in a recent talk... Puffer Puffer pass :D Love dolphins :D 
@_date: 2019-11-25 19:24:11
Happened to me also last year in dec. Thats why i missed to buy around 3800... Have to live with that... It is not easy. We got to accept :(
@_date: 2019-11-26 14:12:51
Nice one! Done ;) where is my bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-11-22 06:04:29
@_date: 2019-10-26 06:41:49
Tether is a good idea ;) thanks for the help ;)
@_date: 2019-10-26 06:43:19
Laughed at this :D thanks
@_date: 2019-10-23 18:15:11
Same here :D bought this morning.
@_date: 2019-10-02 05:22:42
Crypto.com nailed this one ;)
@_date: 2019-10-25 19:30:06
Its in a bank account
@_date: 2019-10-25 20:21:43
Thanks for the help :)
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:23:50
@_date: 2019-10-29 05:50:20
You mean "i are hodl" correct?
@_date: 2019-10-25 19:52:14
Wish the money was mine :) thanks for the tip ;)
@_date: 2019-02-13 17:22:46
Big, true if
@_date: 2019-12-09 22:50:09
Doesn't make it okay...
@_date: 2019-12-09 22:48:11
That is it exactly! You shouldn't use anything where you are not in controll of your private keys... It applies for exchanges and wallets as well. ;)
@_date: 2019-12-20 11:26:14
Funny thing is: This actually makes sense. :)
@_date: 2019-12-10 01:32:12
Move it off there to a safe place like a hardware or even a paper wallet.
@_date: 2019-12-09 22:44:16
Not the first and not the first to this address either :S
@_date: 2019-12-09 22:45:25
THIS! ;)
@_date: 2019-12-10 00:01:25
Yep. Same plan here. Moving everything out ;)
@_date: 2019-12-09 19:35:55
I wouldn't wait "until they fuck up" if I was you...
@_date: 2019-12-09 19:58:32
My thoughts exactly... Proof of Keys will prove even more meaningful this time. 
The sum is not big... 3 digit in USD...
@_date: 2019-12-04 12:27:53
Nice one! This is the one! Thanks ;)
@_date: 2019-12-12 20:39:37
I do... it is included in my question. ...Also no need to call me Jesus. Feel free to call me ODredy ;)
@_date: 2019-12-09 19:38:07
To my hardware wallet ;)
@_date: 2019-12-09 19:20:53
Get your coins off the exchanges! 
"Not your keys not your coins"
@_date: 2019-12-10 14:25:40
I buy (or lets say use to buy) my coins there... You have any other good alternatives? I don't mind if there is no KYC :D
@_date: 2019-12-12 20:40:50
THIS! vv
@_date: 2019-12-04 13:29:21
Interesting way to look at it :D
@_date: 2019-12-09 19:30:23
Its my (OP) comment :) Im trying to motivate people to do the same ;)
@_date: 2019-12-10 14:27:36
Its over 2,5 years old... First time this happened and this is not my biggest withdrawal...
@_date: 2019-12-09 23:48:10
Your last sentence! ;)
@_date: 2019-01-25 13:00:45
Thank you :) 
@_date: 2019-01-25 10:02:40
Fair point! I won't say we or someone should do it, because I don't think it is morally right with the monkeys :) Although, if we did it, do you think the outcome will be different? 
@_date: 2019-01-25 10:53:48
Yes! I'm with you!
@_date: 2019-01-25 10:28:56
Here is the equivalent that has been done. On humans
@_date: 2019-01-02 22:03:22
Yes, but nothing to do ;) 
@_date: 2019-01-25 10:16:33
Haha :D nice one. 
Meanwhile I found something that is very, very similar! ON HUMANS :O  
@_date: 2019-01-27 22:35:03
Thats a good idea. 
@_date: 2019-01-25 12:16:49
Yes I do! And you don't. Accept it!
@_date: 2019-01-25 10:21:25
Awesome! Thanks for sharing!
@_date: 2019-01-16 14:15:39
To be honest with you. I wanted to put it on the r/cryptocurrency thread. But i just subbed there and reddit didnt allow it yet. Any suggestion where I should put it?
@_date: 2019-01-25 09:31:49
Might not have happened, but it has a message... That is what matters in my opinion
@_date: 2019-01-25 13:00:12
Correct me if I'm wrong, but for that to be that case we should see a new low after the 2nd of Feb... Right? Otherwise we would consider the previous low (sometime in Nov 2018) to be the end of the current (or last) bear market... 
@_date: 2019-01-25 10:36:36
Here is the human version  
@_date: 2019-01-25 12:15:13
The message IMO is that sometime it is worth taking a step back and question things. Why do we do things the way we do. There might be a better solution. But we will never implement it if we don't question things from time to time. 
@_date: 2019-01-26 11:32:53
Sorry about that :D
@_date: 2019-01-25 10:20:49
Awesome find! Here is the video 
@_date: 2019-01-26 00:35:29
Wow! Thank you very much! My first tip! ;) 
@_date: 2019-09-08 18:04:49
I used to keep weed in one of these altoid boxes :)
@_date: 2019-09-07 20:17:48
Happy cake day!!!
@_date: 2019-05-15 07:15:10
If you do this search, make sure you click on bitcoin too. It will train google search that this relationship is important. ;)
@_date: 2018-12-24 14:39:26
Yes, that would be the case if the government actually cared about their citizens. The truth is (imo) that the government is a collection of greedy and egoist people who mostly care about their own well being. Its not some magic institution. Its still people. 
They only keep up the image that they care about their citizens...
