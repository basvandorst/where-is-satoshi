ITT A lot of the Politically Correct worrying about image and how this will "Come Across". 
I personally thought it was very well done and got the message across quite clearly!
But hey let's dial it back a notch so we don't offend anyone. /S

It's not fair and it has it's fair share of close-minded folks but unfortunately this is how the world works. You have a choice to make. Spent a lot of time, energy, and focus on trying to win this battle or take the lesson for what it is and move on. Understand this isn't the last time you'll be in this situation, so keep that in mind when you decide how to move forward.  There's a saying that always comes to mind when I see this type of behavior from folks. "Never argue with an idiot. They will drag you down to their level and beat you with experience."

This may be way off base but I think TPB is a good example of staying one step ahead. granted they're probably not being pursued as vigorously but they have the right idea. Staying on the move and delegating makes them pretty slippery.

I'm really interested but I live in the US and you're going to need people from everywhere BUT here.
