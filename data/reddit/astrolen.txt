Saving (sometimes called hoarding) is a very positive indicator;
Saving shows that the person holding bitcoin has confidence in the bitcoin ecosystem, has expectations of an increase in the value of bitcoin in the near to mid term future and a prudential strategy in personal wealth management.
When talking about deflation, some economists will argue that hoarding is the natural result of an increasingly valued currency, which leads to a negative effect on an economy due to the slowing down and stalling of the flow of money (however, you'll never hear a bank manager telling you not to save your money!).
I see some false assumptions to this theory.
This assumption is that everybody is the same. Somehow, everyone has found themselves in the exact same financial position, operating within the exact same macro economic conditions, and with the exact same understanding, perception and expectations of what the market will do, and are all acting in perfect synchronicity. Like we've all turned into the Borg or something.
I also see a contradiction here. They say when the value increases people will hoard, but when people hoard the value decreases. So a bitcoins value is both increasing and decreasing at the same time? or is a bitcoin is worth more in somebody else's hand (Hint: It's a bank) but mine?

Would you say your dog has any intrinsic value? Or is it based on the subjective comparison of the attributes you value from some conceptual ideal of a dogs behaviour?
Can a dog be objectively determined to be a good dog by having qualities that comply with universally accepted concepts of good dogged-ness?
Is the value you place on your dogs goodness indicative of its past performance? Can this behaviour be considered an indicator of your dogs future performance?
IMO If you are happy, and the dog is happy, and no cats are harmed in the process, then that's all that anybody else should be concerned about.
But I guess that just shows my subjective bias towards cats, because a dog that chases cats is bad. And barking, I don't like barking dogs, unless they do it for a good reason.
Edit: Further questions; How do you value a dogs abilities in stayitivity compared to its fetchiness? and do these metrics seem useful in the value comparison to the behaviour of a cat?

If money and trade is to be considered analogous to speech and expression. Know Your Customer (KYC) laws come into conflict with privacy law. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) seems to arise from the presumption of guilt, and acts like censorship.

I disagree with this idea for a couple of reasons.
Almost every time I've seen a picture posted with a QR code, like when that guy made the news for holding up a sign at college saying "Mom send bitcoin", soon after somebody had photoshopped their own QR code over the top and then tried to pass it off as the original. Before long there would be multiple torrents available, each one with a different QR code, you wouldn't know which one is the original, and the creator would have lost control and ownership of their work.
In my mind it's also kinda crass. You'd be disfiguring your work, and distracting your audience.
It would be better to direct donors to a website or facebook page or something you control, that gives the donor confirmation that they are sending to the intended recipient.

I think they're the words you're looking for.
In that same paragraph talking about the heroes and villains you might also mention the Central Banks of various nations issuing their warnings and proclamations, and exerting their power to write a nations laws.
You sound inspired and willing to explore and express this new paradigm so here's some food for thought for a future article.
Consider how the mathematical and scientific development of units of measurement have changed our society.
For measuring distance we've progressed from cubits, which measure the length of a persons forearm, to using a standardised piece of iridium or tungsten. In 1983 the international community adopted a standard unit of measurement for the metre as the distance light will travel in a vacuum in a fraction (1/299 792 458^ths) of a second. Twenty years later this mathematical precision enabled us to send a buggy to *another planet*, and to know where it would land.
The reliable measurement of time has it's own fascinating story which had a profound historical influence in navigation and cartography using astronomy. Today the time stamp of a satellite has to be calibrated to allow for it's high speed relativistic movement across the heavens in comparison to our time here on Earth.
Now here's Cryptocurrency. It's a mathematically proven unit of measurement of value, that isn't subject to external forces. It will always be known exactly how many bitcoins there are in existence, emerging from a protocol that is unilaterally accepted by those that adopt it.
There was a reference on to the scepticism that Marco Polo faced when he introduced paper currency to the court of Venice. Bitcoin has some similarities, as it also takes some serious mental gymnastics to get your head around.
I see the volatility in price as a measure of adoption and acceptance. It's not a measure of the number of bitcoin, but a measure of the acceptance of the protocol and the interaction with the economy.
Meanwhile bitcoins are working their way into the consciousness and economies all over the world. Not just the US, but the EU, in Germany, Netherlands and Sweden. In Asia, such as Singapore and Hong Kong. In the Mediterranean in Cyprus, Israel and Turkey. Wait until Africa, South America, and India really begin to wake up.
Add a bit of imagination and it will keep you up at night.

Regarding storage of bitcoins, from an earlier post;
"Spend some time to learn about security.

Everything after that is pointless if you fail in your due diligence there."

Add to that a much larger community that Bitcoin and Litecoin have created already that acts as a stepping stone into the later generations of coins and a much more even distribution of wealth can be seen.
I also believe that these second and third generation cryptocurrencies are a great opportunity for development and experimentation. They too have a lot of room for improvement, but I look forward to seeing some functionality incorporated in the mining process, like Primecoin and Curecoin have started, and hopefully the future of [BOINC]( coins.

This idea sounds cool, I can think of a couple ways it might be used.
Say you have an online store that you want to promote. You offer a free shirt with every order over a certain amount. That shirt has your brand and a QR code. The QR code contains a link to the online store and a random referral code. When the customer receives the shirt, the first time it's scanned it directs to the site to claim ownership of the referral number by creating an account. Then if anybody else scans it they can get an introductory discount, and the person that has claimed the referral code can also get a discount added to their account.
I could also see it used to promote something like an annual music festival or conference. Where you buy the shirt (again with a referral QR code) the first time you go to the con, and earn a points towards admission tickets to the following years event.
Edit: Of course this completely removes the need for bitcoin. :/

plus some other stuff that I had already self censured as it was turning into a rant...

The power of each mutation can be divided up to eight billion times!
Every time you collect Pokecoins^TM you have a chance at finding more!
You can also increase the power of the mutations already in your collection!

Just like to most people, the content on the box, the actual box in front of them, and the transmission method are all just known as "Television".

Hypothetically, say I had bitcoins in an exchange that took a long time to get fiat out of.
I set up a business that accepts Bitpay, or one of the other registered money transmitters.
That business sends me an invoice for a nominal amount.  I pay the bill in bitcoins, Bitpay converts the bitcoins into fiat, and they pay the business.
However I accidentally overpaid my bill, by several orders of magnitude (I don't get these metric prefixes) and have generated a credit.
So I refund myself the difference, and now have my fiat out of ~~Mt.Gox.~~ the exchange.
How many laws/regulations did I break?

The question is who, and the answer is both the buyer and the seller, once both are in agreement.
The rest of the world might have their own opinions, but it's not really relevant to that sale.

It's not that the key is fake, that can be verified by using it to sign a transaction. The problem is that the key may have been copied, and could be used by somebody else to sign your bitcoins away.
