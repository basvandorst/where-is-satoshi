I am ABSOLUTELY new to Bitcoin...
I have been following this sub for almost a year and have always wanted to invest in bitcoin or any other crypto currency (Not Shitcoin)
Any Tips or Tricks, What Should I Expect? What Should I Invest into first?
Btw I’m 13, but still! If WSB Is A Thing Then Why Can’t I Damn It!
@_date: 2019-09-10 16:53:27
Yeah that’s what I meant
@_date: 2019-09-10 14:58:19

@_date: 2019-09-10 17:53:22

Why Isn’t That Ever Covered In our news smh ��‍♂️.

Bitcoin and HODL, I Like It!

I Live in Lithuania so such a thing doesn’t exist yet
@_date: 2019-09-10 17:19:04
That’s the plan! I’ll probably start working Summer 2020 and I’ll save up

I Know, but I Still Am Curious, because I would like to be a crypto trader in the near future.
I Would Rather Prepare myself for the future, then just to Do Mindless Nonsense Day In, Day Out...
I know I seem arrogant, but I’m more curious and really interested
I know I will have to wait YEARS for ANY sort of chance of profit, but that’s a risk I’m willing to take.
I Really believe That Crypto Will become the future someday, I just want to be prepared

Ayyy, Thanks for the Idea!
I’ll Try
