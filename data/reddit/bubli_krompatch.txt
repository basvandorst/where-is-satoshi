I am using samourai wallet, simple, quick, rock solid.. You can choose if you want to use segwit address with one switch and you can manually set fee by clicking directly on it..... It's quick, try it
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:34:17
I dont understand why are they still in beta(alpha) version, I use it and it is rocksolid
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:38:03
I am glad sensible people see this, it is annoying 
@_date: 2017-11-11 09:07:15
Those are not the same people saying it 
@_date: 2017-11-06 09:32:55
I use Samourai wallet (android- alpha version), it uses segwit addresses and fees really are lower, tried it next to copay wallet I was using at the time 
@_date: 2017-09-29 20:13:58
I've sent people including me had similar question, just search in "new" 
@_date: 2017-10-21 17:26:38
I wouldnt do any transactions during fork and some while after that (if you are just hodling like me it is not a problem) After a while there should be informations about wallets, used chains etc. If you find out your wallet will use 2x chain, just install other wallet you want and use your passphrase there for recovery. 
That is what I am going to do. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 19:58:17
Can actually Copay somehow force me (trick me) into using segwit2x? I know they will probably support it

People don't realize that if someone is stubborn and goes broke, someone else has to take care of him
@_date: 2017-10-15 16:15:21
That's what I'm trying to solve right now. Which wallet to use? 
@_date: 2017-10-15 15:23:20
is there a list of android wallets that will not support 2x?
@_date: 2017-10-15 17:04:00
okay that electrum-on-tailsOS sounds confusing lol
Im thinking about normal android wallet.
Isnt Samourai in alpha yet?
What about breadwallet or mycelium? I will look at electrum.
@_date: 2017-10-15 15:59:21
I use copay (bitpay) and bitpay said it will support s2x, I really hope they will not try and trick me into using s2x as normal bitcoin
@_date: 2017-10-18 20:31:13
Sounds interesting, thank you

They didn't mock the bitcoin, Salomondrin is actually quite excited about blockchain and bitcoin, he made a video about that with one of his friends
@_date: 2017-10-21 18:09:50
the moment you use your wallet recovery passphrase (12 or 24 words) in another app (copay, electrum, mycelium, samourai etc.) you can use it afterwards (but you cant have same wallet and use it in two different wallet apps)

I'm trying to educate him, but it looks like he has tunnel vision and doesn't have a clue about surroundings. Thank you for your reply 
@_date: 2017-10-21 17:40:13
I dont think so. If there are no informations in blockchain about you sending money anywhere, you cant lose any money. Wallets just help you with writing these informations in blockchain.
BUT I think there will be wallets, that will deliberately use segwit2x chain after hard fork (that is the reason why this hard fork is so dangerous), that is why I will wait for further informations from wallet providers

1. Value of bitcoin is simply given by people wanting to buy it
2. Use youtube: how does bitcoin mining work
3. Use youtube: how does bitcoin blockchain work

Im using Samourai after your advices, thank you, now it has SegWit
@_date: 2017-10-21 22:09:38
nice, I think Im gonna use this wallet
@_date: 2017-10-15 17:22:56
okay I will try Samourai. All I need to do after installing Samourai is just using the x-word phrase I got when creating my first wallet in copay, correct? And after that uninstall Copay? Im sorry for such noob questions, I never did this before
@_date: 2017-10-22 13:15:38
install wallet on your mobile (Electrum,Mycelium, Samourai, etc.), create new wallet, WRITE DOWN AND KEEP your passphrase (12 or 24 word phrase) and send btc from your coinbase online wallet to your mobile wallet
@_date: 2017-10-15 17:38:34
Yeah thats pretty cool, so why is there  a function EXPORT WALLET? In case, you want use your wallet on client that doesnt support BIP39?
@_date: 2017-10-18 19:30:30
could you compare fees with coinbase?
@_date: 2017-10-13 19:19:53
I'm sorry what do you mean by the second part? 
@_date: 2017-10-15 18:26:52
thank you very much, will try
@_date: 2017-10-13 21:07:51
Eh you are right I guess, but I still have a feeling that he buys recklessly not knowing what is going on (segwit2x etc.) He only looks at graphs and buys like a sheep in herd (buys because price is rising and I'm afraid he is going to sell if it drops significantly) 
@_date: 2017-10-22 13:13:51
you absolutely need to have your personal wallet app, at least on mobile. If you keep bitcoin on coinbase, they can do whatever they want with it, it is like keeping money in bank (3rd party keeping your money)
@_date: 2017-10-15 16:32:03
HODLing, but amounts that dont justify buying hardware wallet (maybe one day) I wanna use android wallet for now
@_date: 2017-10-18 19:26:01
Is BitStamp good? I started with Coinbase of course, but I would like to try new exchange, if it meant lower fees in general
