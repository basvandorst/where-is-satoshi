When you send Bitcoins, then chance send to new address because when you send Bitcoin, you also send decrypted public key and when QC have this public key, can fast find private key.
Use one Bitcoin address only once :)

If exchanges will decentralised then who cares who made it. Now there aren't, and I care who have my money.
@_date: 2014-04-12 16:50:57
Thank you!
@_date: 2014-09-04 08:36:42
nothing, I'm just saying ^^
I recommend bitfinex.com or other china exchanges (very great and secure)
@_date: 2014-08-20 13:58:40
Ok, now is working :) problem solved
@_date: 2014-04-29 12:23:21
First when I make website who accept Bitcoin payment I use bips.me...... i lost about 1BTC !!!
Now I use Blochain API and recommended this all people to do it instead using BIPS.me!

Don't use one Bitcoin address twice or more times. If U send transaction, U send also your public key (from pair).
Public key != Bitcoin address
@_date: 2014-08-29 12:47:41
U can use Google Translator to understand my analysis correctly ;) I will add the analysis average several times a week (short and medium term).

My service runing all 2 years. I'm very happy introducting of Bitcoin payment.

"End of QE" is a ONE BIG JOKE. For now FED stop printing but Japan start printing for dollars (much more then FED). There is BIG SWAP monopoly to get another currency.
End of FIAT money is near! Don't use this scam to save your savings (use Gold/Silver if u dont like Bitcoin or Litecoin).
@_date: 2014-04-03 22:09:06
of course YES!
I recommend Blockchain.info API (0% fee !!! no transaction fee !)
@_date: 2014-10-25 16:52:07
Damn, you are copy my words :D Are hear about copyright? :P

Please support Litecoin, not Dogecoin. Doge don't have a secure network - only 500$ in ASIC (hashrate rent) can destroy this crypto...
