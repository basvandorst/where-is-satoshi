No. You gotta think of it like a currency... because it is a currency. If nobody is willing to sell  per bitcoin then the price wouldn’t be 1million per bitcoin it would be much more than that
It’s like other currency in the world. They fluctuate a lot and they have an exchange rate. For example 1 usd is .90 euro, on the same scale 1 bitcoin is (roughly) 10,000$

It would explain why Satoshi Nakamoto hasn’t touched his Bitcoin yet. He’s got it in an offline wallet so once the future comes around and he gets back from 2009 he’ll be the richest man on the planet.

I’m holding. Doubt it’s gonna drop more but if it does it’s gonna bounce back quicker than it fell and spiral into even higher highs. For those saying 6k bitcoin. Good. Then I can buy a whole bitcoin before it’s worth a million.

Exactly. Hence why I said Libra isn’t a true cryptocurrency. At least that’s the way I heard it. 
I’m just some guy on Reddit though. I’d recommend anyone to watch the hearings themselves before making any serious financial decisions.

I think while Mark Zuckerberg is visiting Congress today he should recommend the US Government to spend 40 billion on bitcoin, a small investment really, and when bitcoin becomes the world currency we’ll have no more debt and have a 20t surplus.
@_date: 2019-07-16 19:28:28
Probably. Although I don’t see why it’s crashing because Libra is barely a cryptocurrency. It’s more like a prepaid Visa card that you can send the digits to your uncle across the world.
Congress wants it backed by the American dollar. Sounds like FB wants to back with many fiat currencies when the idea behind cryptocurrency was to break away from fiat currency for when the current money system collapses.
When you buy Libra they’ll then use your money to compound interest, but you don’t gain interest on your money. 
Oh remember that whole decentralization of the banks that make bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies strive? Nope. Your bankers are gonna be Facebook, google, visa, chase, Amazon, and Apple. Not necessarily these exact companies but potentially 100 “elected” companies/people will be running libra, not the people. 
Reasons bitcoin is better than Libra:
It’s run by the people.
It’s not based off a over printed currency which are based on thin air.
It’s bitcoin.

Remember, wait too long and you’re going to end up missing out in the long run. We just saw a 9k dip. Should’ve bought then. You might never see 9k again. Bitcoins doing fine at 10.5k, so idk what you’re talking about.

Buy a house and take on as much debt you can manage (low interest rates like house/car loan). Buy some bitcoin.
You houses value goes up bitcoin goes up and the American dollar crashes. Now that 100,000$ house you bought is worth 250,000 and you have more than enough to pay back the 100,000$ but don’t have to immediately so you hodl.

If you think about it, all a country would have to do is buy all their citizens worth of currency.(money in circulation in your country+more:equivalent to rest of the money in the world) then say it’s their new currency and embrace bitcoin. Trade Sell BTC to people for what it was bought at(average). If you’re a populated country like the USA or China then you could easily do this for less than 100billion(the USA spends more on war per year/BTC market cap is less than 200b now) then embrace it. The reward would be your country would flourish, economy would be amazing, and Bitcoin would rise dramatically... the USA could embrace it now and wipe out its debt, the FOMO would be too great for China and many other countries to buy in. Individuals would buy in(everyone who isn’t invested and people who are would buy more if they can) Bitcoin will rise. All it takes is a leap of faith and the devaluation of your currency(which would be okay because you bought bitcoin for everyone in your country. If you could do it privately then the price wouldn’t rise much(people would get FOMO/buying ALOT would result in a price rise) either way in the end. Bank is made, countries could become rich, and debt could be erased,

Strong time to buy! Lucky number 7 says so. BTC rose nearly 5x, this year alone then crashed down to 6800, still double the yearly average and the best cash asset since 2010

I think the question is referring to the market cap of bitcoin. (200trillion) in which case the price would only rise with inflation based off the fact that it would be a world wide currency at this point.

Keep debt if you have to and as much bitcoin as possible. If a currency collapses and bitcoin rises just sell some of your bitcoin and now you have no debt. If bitcoin were to crash at least you have a new car.
@_date: 2019-08-08 07:29:13
I hope at this point he at least took out the money he invested to pay off his house again. 1.9 million in bitcoin and no debt is still better than 300k in debt and a small possibility for bitcoin to crash.

Put in 100$ a paycheck or whatever you can afford until you get the amount you want. If it goes up you profit, if it goes down you buy at a lower price. Pretty much win win.

Bitcoin could easily reach a market cap of 1 trillion dollars. That would be a x5 of today’s current price. If Bitcoin becomes a world currency it could 1000x today’s price.

You can’t buy bitcoin with a credit card? Lmfao. At least I haven’t found a place that lets you(let me know if you do because I’m gonna take advantage of my 1% cash back 1000+ times.)
@_date: 2019-08-21 05:15:19
Your argument is invalid. If the price were manipulated then you’d be buying the bitcoin for that price that you self manipulated. Therefore no real capital gains. Because when time comes to sell where are the buyers?
 
Also how is this different than any other stock? People seem to forget stocks can be manipulated just like bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-19 09:42:00
Keep the vin number of the vehicle somewhere written down. Once you get the bitcoin transfer it to your own private offline wallet.(and maybe sell some) if they tried scamming you and the car was under your name you could always report the car as stolen. But even that’s not a guarantee to get your car back.

The closer we get to global adoption the higher the price will be. The market cap (total value of bitcoin) is around 200billion. The estimated total of all currency worldwide is approximately 200trillion. (x1000) you decide if there’s room to grow.

Elon musk isn’t a fan of bitcoin. Then again I’m not sure someone has really explained it to him...
If someone really explained it to him the smart thing for him to do would be invest like 1 billion into crypto and then tweet out something like “Bitcoin is the new 5G.” Bitcoins price rises 400% in one day. Elon sells half his bitcoin and now is 2 billion richer and has 1/400th of the total bitcoin supply.

Just another reason to buy bitcoin. Ask to speak to a manager and tell them you’re moving money out and what it’s for, who the company is pulling the money out. They’ll let you move money to Robinhood, which you can buy bitcoin on. You don’t own your own keys though but it’s a good temporary solution.

The cyber truck is a free car, it’s definitely worth the pre-order. It’s 47,000 today and you can lock in the price of the car today for 100$. It can DRIVE ITSELF. Send the car off while you’re at work. It can make you back estimated half the price of the car in its first year. Oh and if robotaxis aren’t working by the time the cybertruck comes out you don’t have to buy the cybertruck and you can get your 100$ back.

I mean I bought at 10k. I figured it was bull run season and I really had FOMO. Went up to 14k and thought it would be nice to sell. Long story short I should’ve bought more and sold some at 14k like I was gonna then go and flip my investment and double my bitcoin.

I learned about bitcoin when it was about 200-300$ in 2015, my buddy from work was talking about building a mining rig. I questioned it and thought it was cool and concerned buying some but didn’t. Big regret because I saw it hit 20k and my jaw dropped. I could have had a quarter of a million but realistically I would have put probably 1000-3000$ in. I didn’t buy because I thought it was too much. Obviously I was wrong. Started investing some money on Robinhood (I know own your own keys) and saw bitcoin was in a bull run (saw it move from 3k-8k). Next thing I know it’s 9900 and another buddy posted on social media something along the lines “here we go! Bitcoin 10k!” I decided it was probably a good idea to buy then and bought in. 14k went and passed. :( I’ve learned to hodl and I’m going to be buying more in the near future when I have money to invest. Most of my net worth now is in my education but I really almost regret going to college vs buying a lot of bitcoin.
Just glad I can be an “early” investor.
