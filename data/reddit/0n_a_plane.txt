Thanks for all the info! I had no idea about any of that stuff. I now wish I'd stuck to BTC :( I would still have my $600

The BTC fees are too high and transactions take too long

It wasn't a user mistake it was a technical issue with dream market :/

Thanks! Great to know! I'm defs going back to BTC after this. Just wish I figured it out sooner :(

I've tried contacting dream market and they just don't respond to support requests. Is there any way I can export my dream market wallet's private key myself?

What are the issues with BCH? At first it seemed like people were suggesting to switch to BCH, and I did because the BTC transaction fees and times were getting way too high...

Thanks. Is there a way I can export the private key myself or do I need to rely on dream market to do it? 
They have not responded to my support requests, even after I sent extra BCH to the correct address and those disappeared too...

I've always been super careful not to make this mistake, but I guess it was bound to happen at some point

Yeah it was months ago I stoppped using btc. I have made some small btc transactions recently and the fees were still much higher than bch, probs not as bad as they uesd to be. Either way, after this I will be going back to btc anyway.
