Wow that's awesome. You rock for donating that! there's no reason why universities should be priced so high, it is unaffordable for the everyday folk to attend nowadays without being buried in student loans. Many people don't see the benefits of going to a 2 year Community College first, then getting your bachelors. So many people would save so much money. Hopefully I can pay off my future student payments with Bitcoin. :D

Just made a small purchase about an hour ago from Amagi. Looking forward to the package next week.
I was looking at other bullion dealers but this one stuck out for one reason: It accepts bitcoin.
No longer can credit card companies and banks sell my information, all while knowing: what I'm buying, how much, and who I'm buying it from. This is my personal information and hopefully the bitcoin revolution will enlighten some of our bankster frauds. These scum will stop at nothing to scrape ever penny out of your pockets. Thank you Amagi Metals for being the first online bullion dealer to accept bitcoin!

It amazes me; the more people don't know about bitcoin, the more likely they are to bash it. Oh well... I guess staying ignorant is easier than doing your own research.

Wow! Bitcoin's CEO also buys from Amagi? Looks like I'm in good company. 
@_date: 2014-05-22 01:21:20


No, Amagi Metals was the first. They started accepting bitcoin on Dec 12, 2012, almost [1.5 years ago]( I hate when articles from MSM get stuff like this so wrong. 
How can the general public be well informed about something as complex as bitcoin when all the media gives to the public is misinformation?

Yeah, Josh was a great guy. Here in this article he is bragging about buying 2 cars, then got a bit greedy and bought a house for $500,000 with bitcoin. I wouldn't be surprised if these are the coins stolen from customers. It's not looking very good for him..
I knew this guy was scum after seeing [this video]( Doesn't even know how to talk to people like a human being. Hope he thinks about this in jail, and hopefully improves as a person.

Thanks for your perspective. Never thought of it that way.

Lol, I would have said: "brb withdrawing all my money, ill give you guys a call tomorrow myself to close it." and hung up. I refuse to be apart of any bank that restricts me with MY own money. They will only realize their mistake once it hits them in the pockets! Things will stay this way... if there is no incentive to change of course. Hopefully bitcoin puts these scum out of business.

Nice work!  A couple questions..
* Will the people that bought your CD be able to use these new features, or will we have to buy another new version of the CD?
* Do you have a way to offer these updates to people who already bought the CD? 
* Will there be a way to update/upgrade or not? I know it's a DVD-R so probably not...

You're right, overtime there will probably be consumer products that make it easier for the laymen to get started with using bitcoin. It took me a while to get started just because so much information needed to be absorbed before it all made sense.
It is true that technology makes us dumber in certain ways. By making a technology that does something automatically, such as a calculator, we lose all desire to do math equations and solve problems by hand the long way. This compares to the problem with bitcoin, that it is so complex(a good thing) that the average person can't seem to understand it because of the vast amount of misinformation presented by main stream media outlets with a specific agenda. People are used to doing transfers the long way(via banks and paypal, western union etc, which usually take a couple days) Overtime, people will develop tech that makes bitcoin integrated into our lives; making it simpler and easier to use in the real world. No one knows the technical aspects of many technologies or how they work, yet people still trust these technologies. A couple more years and people will start seeing the true benefits of bitcoin.

    How do you keep it, well since it's virtual, an online wallet is the only way.
Immediately lost credibility when he said that, making it seem like ONLINE is t he only way. He neglected to even mention cold storage/paper wallets. There is certainly a bias this reporter is presenting in this MSN money article. A lot/most of the stuff this guys said is true, but he presented it in a negative way.
1: The Irreversible transactions: This is not a bad thing. This makes people smarter about what they buy, and who they buy it from. It creates a healthy market ecosystem with reputable dealers and sellers. This also makes the merchant stay in business because they dont have to worry about reversals or charge backs MONTHS down the line if the item is paid in bitcoin.
2: He argues that bitcoin is "relatively unsafe compared to dollars": Guess what? If I left my $100 on a bench in the subway, someone would take it too. This whole issue of hacking, is a serious problem but user knowledge and education will about proper safety techniques(such as the neglected paper wallets he failed to mention) would eradicate this problem. People just need to stop giving trust to companies they don't know. It is sad that bitcoin attracts lowlife scum like Mark Karpeles, and others looking to make a quick buck. So the idea of "bitcoin being relatively unsafe to the dollar" is absurd. If you bought an item in 1913 for $1000, that item would cost you $23,867.98 due to the dollars inflation today. That is a 2286.8% of inflation, in roughly only 100 years. I'd argue that in the long run, bitcoin isn't as volatile as the dollar was in the past 100 years. The reporter clearly doesn't mention anything about bitcoins deflationary nature. I can't imagine where the dollar and where bitcoin will be in a hundred years.

the reason why people don't want to pay for news anymore is because there isn't good quality journalism, especially now when most media doesn't produce actual NEWS WORTHY stories. Nowadays you've got the media talking about cats stuck in trees and other so called 'breaking news'. Maybe people would pay if there was something to pay for. Same goes for magazines, no wonder we have a dying magazine industry... because half of the whole magazine is ads!

Was there any new information regarding the supposed new "better" exchanges with institutional VCs backing it?  Any idea when the average joe can get in on one of these new exchanges?
I know of buttercoin... saw on their site they have big  investors and a sign that said "also seen on wall street journal, bloomberg" etc.. 
Anything about bitcoinwallet.com? They bought their domain for 250k, must be something big. And also couldn't bitcoinwallet.com make their page HTML5, thus circumventing the app store all together, and still giving mobile users(looking at you apple!) a web wallet? 
Thanks for the post. I would soo want to go to a bitcoin expo and experience all the new things surrounding this currency.

I just left from there at 4pm, got 2 videos; of James D'Angelo and his talk(18 minutes) and Gavin Andresen(his presentation+Q&amp;A session afterwards). Going to upload them to youtube later today. Great Expo, I really enjoyed it. Thanks to everyone who organized it.
Edit: James D'Angelo video: 
Gavin Andresen video: Having trouble getting the file off my phone. It will take some time to upload but I will do it eventually. Every time my usb cable "interrupts" and I have to start the transfer over. Doesn't help that it is 4.4 GB big and that it takes 1 hour 20 minutes to copy to my desktop! :(

Wow. They didn't even bother sending the rest of the "invites" out. Nonetheless, just signed up to see what's all the hype about.
