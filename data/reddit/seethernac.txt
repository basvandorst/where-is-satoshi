To be more specific, where are you from? You could use btcturk, paribu or koinim in Turkey.

You can not buy bitcoin from bitcoin.com. Bitcoin.com is more of a informative page. It has wallet options but i do not recommend it.
Try other options for buying BTC. Bitoasis, BTCTurk, Paribu, Koinim are good. If you live somewhere in EU, you might use bitstamp as well.

Your bitcoins will be safe, even if breadwallet is not available anymore. Basically, your seed words are just a tool used to reach your private key. All you have to do is to convert your seed words into your private key. After compiling your original private key, you can reach your bitcoins with any client.
Here is a bip39 converter: 
WARNING: Never ever type your seed words into a website. You should do this in a controlled, preferrably offline environment.

You can use mobile wallets on your smart phone. It's better than storing your bitcoins on a exchange service. You have too many options. Try breadwallet, copay or greenwallet.

Could you be more specific? What do you mean with percentage growth? Bitcoin amount? Market cap?
As Bitcoin amount increases over time, market cap increases accordingly. Price you have to pay for a single Bitcoin increased dramatically. Closing price for the date of July 19, 2010 was 5 cents, which makes 88000% price increase(as of August 26, 2017).

Turkish financial regulatory constitutions are highly interested in cryptocurrencies. Capital boards of Turkey officially published a important article in 2016. (
I am frequently checking the webpage of Turkish Central Bank and today i saw this statement on Turkey's mainstream news channels. People are realizing the power of bitcoin, so are the Central Banks. They know, they can't control bitcoin itself, but they are aware that they can regulate money flow  to bitcoin exchanges.

What is the configuration of your node? I just connected to your node with my Raspberry Pi :)

I see your point but i believe this is just a workshop. I find it important because Turkish Central Bank is hosting this event and Central Bank's point of view is very important. I don't know what the outcome of this workshop will be but i think efforts on this subject must be supported, not restrained.
Your nationality is not important in this regard.

Thanks for sharing your opinion. I am pretty sure in the future we are going to see one hell of a fight between governments and cryptocurrency market. Today the market is small and can be neglected. But we dont know what the future will bring. Time will tell. 
Stay safe and sound in Turkey.

Sorry, but i didn't understand what you mean.

What's gonna happen if you die right now? Your bitcoins are forever lost?

I like that analogy: Bananas and bitcoin.

I've been running BIP148 node on my unused laptop(OS Linux Mint). My node is fully synced and i am contributing to the network for over a month. My ISP plan covers 50 gigs upload and 100 gigs download per month. My usual connection speed is 25MBPS DL/5MBPS UL. After reaching 50 GB upload limit ISP throttles down upload and download speed. Bitcoin nodes' upload average is 15 gigs per day. Unfortunately, i had to cool down bitcoin-qt little bit (reduced upload speed to 1024 kbps). Otherwise i am having a stone age internet speed (5MBPS/1MBPS).
My question is, is that true limiting upload speed of bitcoin node harms whole network? Is it better to not to run a node than running a node with limited upload speed?
PS. I used wondershaper tool to limit upload bandwidth of  the bitcoin-qt client.
edit: cancelled wondershaper. i am using "bitcoin-qt -maxuploadtarget=350" command, which limits daily upload to 350 MiB.

You can visit this website and educate yourself about bip148 nodes:

after adding Luke-jr's ppa and executing "sudo apt-get" command do not forget to execute this command as well:
    sudo apt-get upgrade
this command upgrades your bitcoin node to v0.14.1.0-1809845, which includes BIP148 support.

Same thing here in Turkey. This weekend I visited one of the biggest tech market in town and had a chit chat with the front desk guy. He told me that the people are rushing to the store when amd graphics cards entering their warehouse.
