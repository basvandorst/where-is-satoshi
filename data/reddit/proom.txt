One good rule of thumb to track inflation is to track the actual inflation of supply (i.e. amount of money being printed year-to-year). For example, in US it's averaging between 5% and 6%. The inflation calculations are vulnerable to inaccuracies and great deal of manipulation, even to a point where if you're given a same dataset and provide it to two independent teams to work out the inflation one team can arrive at 2% and the other at 15%. Guess which one gets the contract.

That's not... Thats now how anything works. Market cap is literally the price multiplied by the total supply. You can't divide it and somehow get a bigger number.

Not sure where you're getting 5$ fees from, it's been 0.10$ - 0.20$ for quite a while now. And this size of a fee is not as important as you'd like to think, most common trade in Venezuela is hand to cash which you do every other day and not for buying meals at restaurants or coffee at Starbucks (which you couldn't do legally either way). They much rather have a safe vault with 10$ it in even if withdrawing costs 0.15$ rather than fiat that loses 20-50% of it's value every day. I do some online businesses with people in Venezuela so I do know.

No it doesn't. Mostly self employed people still remain working because they can adjust to inflation independently, like small store owners, taxi drivers etc. Wages in public sector have not adjusted to inflation, forcing people to quit and go loot from trash containers because that's a more realistic way to earn food. This left one third of the entire *remaining* population unemployed. The army is paid in toilet paper and soap (and other goods) because that's a more valuable &amp; sustainable commodity than their currency.

Market cap doesn't matter, because with infrastructure that's already up and ready for BTC, it becomes exponentially more easy to attack the BCH network and exponentially more dangerous to store your funds on it. Coins with 1% marketcap and 0.01% hashpower are much safer than BCH due to using a different PoW. BCH is a ticking bomb and it's going to blow up in a spectacular fashion (unless they change their PoW and start 'from scratch', which seems like Ver's ego won't allow).

I think he made "invalidateblock" function up, couldn't find documentation on it. And no, none of the exchanges are prepared for this as of now, accidental chain splits happen all the time and they're usually only 1 block long &amp; easy to detect and work around, the '51%' attack would be more difficult to detect and even then what are you going to do as an exchange if you detect that, there's no single wallet that can be blamed if the whole chain is left behind, the only course for an exchange is to freeze all deposits/withdraws indefinitely and investigate, meanwhile the price will fall of the cliff and exchange is left holding useless coins and out of BTC, and keep in mind this is the best case scenario, alternative is that exchange doesn't detect and/or have time to make an executive decision to lockdown in the 15-20 min window it has and then attacker gets away with doublespending it and cashing out BTC. In theory BCH is the most insecure network out of the top 100 altcoins.

True although that's not how doublespending works, in practice, they would have to start alternative chain before unloading their BCH and publish it after they got rid of it. Problem is if they turn off their ASICs from the main BCH chain and unload their BCH in exchanges it would create such a massive dump that it wouldn't be even worth to do a doublespend after that, they'd earn more just by mining BTC instead of attacking BCH chain.

And we all know how that ended, many companies closed down right after, others took 10-15 years to recover their ATH's, including Google, Amazon and the rest.

True, although the first exchange would have the coins from original chain (that's now left behind) and the second exchange will have the coins of the new (long) BCH chain, so it's not exactly like one of the exchanges is left with "nothing". I will be surprized if BCH is still listed on exchanges in 6 months, it's incredibly insecure and it will get attacked. If there's something to learn from blockchains it's the fact that if you put a big enough honeypot that relies on a broken crybersec it will get taken 100%.

Localbitcoins - p2p trading but you're on centralized website, bisq - p2p trading and decentralized network. Both employ some moderators/arbitrage system for the conflicts to be resolved. Localbitcoins run on the web, bisq runs on desktop software, which in my opinion makes bisq slightly more vulnerable. Both networks utilize the trust buildup with successful trades - a way to introduce some degree trustlessness in fiat world, so first you can trade small and it increases over time. In localbitcoins you can arrange to meet live and trade for cash which you can't in bisq. Also in bisq you have some limitations like you can't add multicurrency accounts.

That's a very broad statement that can include anything from debt collection to sport betting.

You can run second layer tech and sidechains on bitcoin to enable any type of smart contract you want.

How do you propose to prove the guessing accuracy on something when that something only happens once. If I say this stock has 40% to go up in the next three days and 60% to go down, and it goes up - it's not a failed guess. And "maybe they got lucky" argument doesn't work for 20 years of results. TA is not some magical 8-ball that will provide you answers, it's just a tool to help you understand what's going on, and economics is not a hard science it's just a study of psychology on a macro scale, anything that claims to have "100%" certainty is full of shit. TA is like setting up high speed cameras and software to crunch coinflip physics that allows you to have a 51% of certainty on which side the coin will land on, a lot of effort and complexity for very little advantage, but that advantage is worth it.

General wisdom in trading is that the more times resistance level is tested the more likely it will break, usually it breaks on the third time and when it doesn't it's almost "destined" to break on the 4th etc. Bitcoin bounced from this level *seven* times in the past 10 months which I haven't heard any stock, commodity, currency or any asset do in the recent history. Meanwhile, the hashrate &amp; cost of mining it kept increasing through the year, completely ignoring this bear market, so likelihood that it will break now is even lower.

I think mine's the first serious answer in this thread. First you need a licence to have a trade business and a licence to trade securities if btc is regarded as a security instead of a currency in your country. Once that's done you'd need declare what bitcoins addresses you hold and log every transaction you make and keep a book of that. If there's ever a problem you send them your book (excel sheet) and the transaction log of your btc address. Also you can include things like business dinner to pay from your btc address but you also need to declare capital gains (or losses) on that 10$ meal so that's just a headache and I recommend using fiat for that. I'm not a legal advisor so the actual legal practice in your jurisdiction might be different &amp; you should consult an actual legal advisor. There's currently a relevant lawsuit where a guy in NY was a big bitcoin trader on localbitcoins without any licence in NY, he did it pretty much as a declaration of freedom of speech, a couple years in and his account was seized and he was arrested, so you can look into the progress on that case.

(1) - You start computing your own private chain, you're including everyone's transactions.
(2) - You sell the 1000 BCH through 100 different accounts but you don't include it on your own private chain, it's still spent on the original chain.
(3) - Now you have as much time as you want to move funds around on your private chain between your accounts.
(4) - Once you have everything set up, you publish your chain, it's the longest chain so it's automatically accepted as de facto correct chain, 1000 BCH appear in your accounts, you have a time window from now to perhaps 15mins until everyone realizes what happened to cash out your BCH into BTC and withdraw it. You can time it for the lunch time or for the weekend evening when people are less likely to be alert. Everyone else continues working on your chain and putting valid transactions on your chain because it's now the true chain.

Also you should start "51%" attack before you spend your coins, not after, just not publish your chain until you get a block ahead of the original chain. So you'd spend coins on original chain while a competing (unpublished) chain still contains your coins since it forked before you spent it, and you get to double spend once you publish this chain.

Yes it will, but it will still grow faster than other energy consumers, as it gets closer and closer to 100% it will obviously slow down. Slightly more realistic scenario is that when it has surpasses some threshold number, like 50% of world's energy consumption we'll have to find a way to artificially cap the network's hashpower, perhaps introduce some protocol changes or just straight out switch the PoW to something else. Or if you're really optimistic, we'll need to hold conferences &amp; organize treaties between key miners where they sign the cold war equivalent agreements against adding more hashpower. As Andreas says, there's probably not enough energy in the world to support two PoW networks but we might be capable of running one and it's probably going to be Bitcoin.

You know when bitcoin hashrate drops? Never. That's right, never. Bear market? MtGox crash? Altcoins flooding the market? Doesn't matter, it always goes up in a predictable manner. That's why so many people are scared about it, at this point the only potential stopping point for btc hashrate is when it exhausts the entire global energy supply.

Yup. As far as I know Barclays is already invested and partnered up with one forex/crypto based startups - Revolut. It's pretty neat, you can deposit fiat and exchange to btc/eth then use the cc card to buy in fiat and get charged in crypto (rather low fees). Basically a reverse of BitPay. No private key ownership or tx between crypto addresses yet though.

Due to asics there's no "fewer miners online", turning your machine off means you're giving it into scrapmetal, and every time the someone goes offline, it incentivizes others to plug in more machines for greater reward. It's a game theory setup where you can only go sideways or up. And to anyone saying "no, it's not true", show me where the hashrate goes is down in this graph: [

Not back to back, it's a one time transaction, from completely different accounts and bitcoin addresses, and "while network is under attack" doesn't stress enough that they would execute trades literally seconds after publishing the contentious chain. So before any news come out and before anyone notices really. And your transaction would have no red flags as all the nodes would verify that it's perfectly fine &amp; legit.
@_date: 2018-08-20 17:26:21
It's advantages are also it's limitations, you can't buy any serious purchases without depositing some bitcoin first (so not a good onramp for new people), also you can't add multicurrency accounts, like if you have an account in EUR and USD you can only choose one and then limit your trading pool to that specific currency. Also, it's a bit subjective but OS security in general is weaker than webserver security and that's weaker than modern smartphone security, so using bisq is more risky. Also apparently it had some hidden fees that I wasn't pleased with. Haven't used it in more than 6 months so let me know if I'm wrong on something.

It's all about risk vs reward. If it's incredibly easy to attack the network and the reward is right then it's going to happen. It doesn't take much effort either, just one employee at one medium sized btc pool who wants to get rich quick executing a simple plan. You find investor with decent size pockets, dump BCH on the exchanges/shapeshifter simultaneously starting alternative chain where you haven't spent anything, once your transactions are confirmed then you publish your BCH chain which is longer and automatically accepted as the correct chain and you dump your BCH on exchanges/shapeshifter again. You withdraw your btc before anyone realizes what happened and fly away. The real trick is to do it early enough because once the exchanges realize they open themselves up for massive breach by supporting BCH they're going to delist it.
@_date: 2018-08-17 05:08:08
Yes it is harmful. Imagine ETF grows so big it becomes half of btc market cap, then one day Roger Ver decides to do a fork again, let's call it Bcash  (BC2). Now Ver just needs to convince a single person to jump into Bcash ship because it's "the real bitcoin" and that could be enough to force entire market to switch onto BC2. Bitcoin will still be Bitcoin, just not  hash power or market cap.

This. And to be honest I don't really care about anyone holding the bch, the bigger problem is that this hack could hit all exchanges simultaneously, and the potential fallout would be a repeat MtGox just an order of magnitude higher. All exchanges, especially fiat-less ones would become fractional reserved and would prompt people to rush to withdraw leaving exchanges insolvent. As much as I like to see BCH fail this would be very bad news for entire crypto space. That's why I hope exchanges will evaluate the rising risk (because the hashrate is dropping) and will put in extra delays/protection layers for people depositing in BCH or delist the coin entirely, before this attack hits the crypto space. And if that doesn't happen soon enough I hope some mining pool that truly does have ethics to handle this will do the doublespend demonstration for some small amount &amp; publish it publically.

It's Bitmains problem. They didn't sell enough BCH in time and now they're forced to mine it at all loss, because dropping the hashrate would most likely destroy the network security and the price. And they can't dump it on the market because BCH has such a low liquidity they would crash themselves down. So their only option is to find someone who buys it OTC but good luck on that.

It's a stretch. I don't considered addition or multiplication as "algorithms", and the airplane crew doesn't perform algorithms either. Furthermore there are no such thing as "subalgorithms". Following rules is not the same as executing an algorithm. The difficulty is defined by how many leading zeros there should be in a hashed nonce, if block is formed in less than 10 minutes the next block should have more, if block is formed in more than 10 minutes the next block should have less, that's all there is to it. And the implementation of bitcoin core **does not define** the consensus rules, and there are alternative implementations. Consensus rules are brought up via community discussions (via email, wiki and other communications) and then agreed upon by having miners signal support for it. Bitcoin core team has a good track record of not screwing up so no surprize that people chose to use their implementation, but it does not define anything.

Everyone seems to have this goal in mind of BTC mcap = gold mcap, like everyone had a goal of 1 BTC = 1 USD back in the day, the reality is that bitcoin is the single tool that can provide freedom and unobstructive, unbiased access to financial world, and at the same time it is the rarest thing to exist to date, rarer than gold or any other precious metal. The compound value of this is much greater than anything we have created so far. The global USD supply is at around 270T and derivatives market is over 1200T.

It's not about fractional reserve, it's about discovering who's money is it.

(1) and (2) can legally and without any notice or trial withdraw any amount from your bank account, (4) can issue a freeze on your account without any notice and withdraw only after the court order.

This is not correct. GDP is not the "income", you have to look at the national budget instead. Here's a simple table:
|Year|US Debt as percentage of budget |
|2008|8.5% |
|2009|5.3% |
|2010|5.7% |
Notice how last time economy collapsed the debt as percentage of national income was at 8.5% and we're already reaching that same level again. If US economy suffers another collapse less than 15 years apart the trust of stability and the trust in USD as a strong reserve currency will be gone.

Yes, it is possible, but the cost of doing so is extraordinary. Remember that the value of the currency is not actually pegged to anything, it's relative and completely subjective, it's value depends on the how the invested parties react to these kind of events (institutions and foreign countries). Traditionally government printing money to cover it's debt signals one thing and one thing only = dump it. And that's how you end up in hyperinflation. The slow and "acceptable" way to do it is to print it and throw it onto the economy, it results in more taxes collected and larger budget, larger GDP, easier to pay off the debt ... *and also easier to borrow,* ***more***. And this cycle has been spinning for the last 50-100 years and here we are now.

It's a myth, gold's "utility" value is not greater than the one of steel or copper, which is roughly 1% of it's value.

Volatility is high because the current market cap is so small, but it only matters if you are here to buy up one day and sell all on the next, that's not the point behind store of value assets, store of value is thinking long term, and gold has been failing us for the past 40 years.

Gold price 2001 = $276.50
Gold is a bad jewelry material, you always have to mix it with something because it's just too soft.
Horses stood "the test of time" for 10000 years until cars came around.
Gold supply is mostly limited by it's value, - it's mined at a certain cost, when value goes up we dig the harder more expensive places, but make no mistake - there is a lot of gold on Earth still in the ground, probably 10-20 times more than we currently have mined out, let alone the asteroids around Earth. Also, deflationary doesn't mean limited supply, it means diminishing supply, which it is definitely not.
It's anonymous, and resistant to government manipulation, fungible and somewhat divisible. However it's hard to verify, hard to safely carry or transact in, hard to transport, and does not have a known capped supply. And the use in electronics and jewelry makes up at best 1% of golds value. Better than holding paper money or Beanie Babies but not even close to Bitcoin.

Not OP, but a couple things:
* People still think the "fractional reserve" means the banks lend out a portion of other peoples money and keep some fraction as *reserve*, while it actually means that banks *usually* don't lend out any of anyone elses money, they use the deposits as "proof of money" to print up to x10 (or even x35) more money and lend it out.
* People still think that inflation is not an orchestrated phenomenon but just some property of fiat money, that "just is" and you can't do anything about it, or that we somehow need it just *because economy*. 
* People still think the study of Economics is something else rather than a study of human psychology on a macro scale. Which means that we don't ever really know what will anything do until we try it, things that were considered as oxymoron, like negative interest rates are reality today. And also that all of it is culturally and geographically bound - one economic theory might work in France but not in Japan.
* People still think there's lots gold in the vaults and that it somehow backs the currency or saves their life savings from disappearing overnight, while in reality it's only your governments relations between foreign governments and large investment firms that keeps your currency stable. Once the relationships go sour or trust is shaken (by for example unexpected election results, unexpected referendum outcome, unexpected drop in gold or oil prices, unexpected drop in national stock markets), the foreign investors will sell their reserves and sell pressure will too high, the government will not sink all of it's resources into saving it (buying it back for gold, oil and foreign currencies), instead at some point it will just drop down the pegged rate or adjust the inflation target. Very common in middle east where relationships between governments are always tight, Iran has official yearly inflation target of 10%, sometimes it overshoots to 35% like in 2013, Turkey has dropped the exchange rate by 50% again after they couldn't maintain the sell pressure, Azerbaijan dropped it's as well.

No, you don't print 2% a year, you actually print 6% a year and then pretend the inflation is only 2%. The absurdity of attempting to track price inflation in the first place is beyond ludicrous, you will always get significant margin of error. To accurately track inflation, say within 1% error rate, every single ingredient of every single item in the world has to be tracked, and cross that with relative production costs, logistics, cost of management etc. What we have now is just people filling up surveys on how much they spend on "rent" or some certain category of food like "cheese". No one cares that people rent further and further out of town to be able to afford it and that cheese becomes "cheese product" and eventually just "yellow sour brick". Inflation forces market to, optimistically, optimize the manufacturing process &amp; logistics, and more often than not - degrade the quality of said products. 
@_date: 2019-06-05 12:33:45
Yes, that's what it is, although I've never heard of anyone charging 8% for payment processing. So in the end using Bitpay you're pay three types of fees: 1% business fee + fee for btc miners + fee for bitpay to possibly reuse your btc in transactions later on. This fee comes basically them being too lazy to adopt segwit and too lazy to implement either weighted average pricings and too lazy to run real time hedging to offset the risk. Any of those would solve this issue. But it helps them to work the narrative of "BtC Is SoOoo eXpEnSivE", and that's the real reason for this fee.

"If we can find just a bit more sand to put into that bottomless bag maybe it will fill up". Or maybe just fix the bag first? The fundamental problem with taxes &amp; the public sector is that if you can hire 2 people to dig a hole in the same amount of time that 1 person would for half the price, **hiring 2 people is always better**. The point of taxes is to create a constant flow of money that would stimulate the economy, which fundamentally ends up reducing to "more money flowing through = better". If we can manage to shake away the responsibility of stimulating economy from the government, and focus on doing the right things, all the hospitals, roads, infrastructure, electricity grid, firefighters &amp; police forces, education, military, NASA and perhaps even UBI can be covered just by inflation, export, import taxes &amp; VAT. Literally 0% income taxes, 0% corporate taxes, 0% property taxes would not be a problem. Second problem is that, due to abnormous tax rates, governments are forced to place tax easing mechanisms and dotations for new companies &amp; young industries, which in the end just creates more legal loopholes for existing established companies.

So you mean *copper*? Copper is more corrosion resistant than gold. Or you just mean the best conductor? Yes, that would be *silver*. Gold is good because it's soft and can be plated on top of other things with relative ease. It's conductivity and corrosion resistance properties aren't what gives it value though, if it was, copper would be worth more than gold.

A hack isn't even that simple to define and the fault isn't always easy to place. What if you're a financial journalist looking for something to write about and you accidentally find (via Google) an unpublished company page of their Q3 report, a couple of days before it's supposed to be officially published (Yes that actually happened). Should you be charged with insider trading and extradited? Or it's a negligence on the company's part? Most of the "hacks" you hear about are due to the organizations being negligent on already existing and well established security holes, often times directly ignoring warnings from security researchers.

Gold is a worse investment than pretty much anything, on average just barely better than holding fiat, and it's still volatile enough that a 20 year old that puts his/her money in gold might not see a new ATH before he/she dies at the age of 80.

So from what I gathered, the main reasons for mining instead of buying is either you have cheap electricity (under $0.05 kW/h) or you know how to navigate the business world well, like setting up low tax corporate structures, arranging B2B deals, seeking investments, so even though you earn less money right off the bat, the fact that you're a business instead of individual helps you scale and grow faster, compensating the initial deficit. Would you say this is the case for you?

Well, not exactly. Most of the time central banks are considered as a separate institution from the government, enacting their own policies, and making monetary decisions independent from political interference. It still answers to executive/political bodies to make sure it's not participating in any (unlicensed) fraud. So it goes something like this:
Lets say central bank raises the interest rates, causing the defaults on adjustable rate loans to go up. The parliament is worried and summons the president of a central bank and ask him:
\- "Are you sure this is a good idea?".
The central bank president replies:
\- "Yep, our models say this is a good idea".
The economy proceeds to collapse, the parliament summons a central bank president again and says:
\- "Why did you let the economy collapse?"
\- "Our models were wrong", he answers.
\- "Well, do a better job next time or we'll replace you (with equally incompetent candidate)!", says the parlament.
\- "Okay", says central bank president.
The end. And eventually people will realize that no one up there actually have a clue what they're doing.

Just like you can code it up, I can copy-paste US declaration of independence, make a couple of edits, have some people sign it and publish it. If no one else recognizes it won't matter. Steel and Iron are just as is irreplaceable as Gold, but they're not useful to us as money. Also, Gold is not really limited, there's a lot of gold that's still undiscovered inside Earth, there are meteorites in close proximity to earth that are loaded with gold, none of them have Bitcoin. So in terms of how hard it is to "make it", bitcoin is definitely harder.

No, the point of cryptocurrency is to let people do whatever the hell they want, with no one to stop anyone's transactions.

It's actually very hard to tell the counterfeits. You can do Magnet tests (fails against most counterfeits), acid tests (fails against most good counterfeits) and x-ray (costs a lot of to buy testing machine, needs electricity to function, licencing in some places, and still isn't 100% definitive). Basically you either need to invest tens of thousands into equipment or be prepared to cut and melt the gold down. There's a reason gold is the most counterfeited material in the world - there's no low cost, low tech, DIY verification that a regular person can do.

All interactions with outside world make ties with your btc addresses and proper chain analysis by an authority or someone very persistent can deanonymize your holdings and transaction history. Even if you do transaction without any ties to real world, you still compromise your location information, as your transaction request is sent to propagate through network someone running many full nodes in different locations will notice the latency at which it arrives and triangulate your approximate location. *Dandelion* update will fix the latter.

To start with 10$k roll and proper roll management you'd need to play low-mid stakes where the rake is on the extreme end, so it's a bit of a time dump, you can get much more just by working online and have your time well invested in a much better way. And don't even mention live poker, everyone knows it's soft, but on the other end you get to play 10 hands per hour, with dealers grinding their minimum wage and not caring about their performance a single bit because it's just another walmart-like job for them.

Your point is valid, we should encourage merchants to integrate even if they don't want to keep bitcoin now, it's important part of the transition. Efforts are being made on both sides, some banking institutions that support holding bitcoin as currency (like Revolut) enable people to pay with Visa while actually converting cash from their BTC accounts. I would like to see developers of these services propose solutions where it's easy to switch between holding conversion on and off. I'm sure when USD starts hyperinflating in the midst of the next crisis people will start reconsider this option.

All of these ideas are false for fiat currencies and true for (majority of) crypto currencies.

For example, housing category focuses primarily on owner-occupied housing costs and not so much on renting costs. The CPI categories and weights are a mix between surveying people on the streets "how much of your salary do you spend on x category?" and just an elaborate guesstimate. A good rule of thumb is to be safe and expect the inflation to be around 5%, and adjust your salary and spending expectations to that. After all, that's what the actual inflation (of supply) is.

So, for example there's an inflation index by American Institute for Economic Research called "Everyday Price Index". For 2012 the BLS reported inflation by CPI to be at 3.1% while AIER reported inflation to be at 8%.


While this is true, it's only true when it's obvious. For example if government reports inflation to be 2% but it's actually 40%. Everyone is aware of inflation but average person isn't paying enough attention on just *how much* it is, so a 2% inflation might look and feel the same as 4% for a lot of people.

Assuming miners at current hashrate are mining profitably at $5000 and assuming bitcoin shot up to $1m today and assuming that suddenly there would be enough hashing power to make mining break-even again, with no tech advancements it would consume 18% of world's total energy.

2. Gold confiscation can happen because it's one of the few assets the government is able to employ to keep the currency stable via buybacks, along with foreign currencies and oil.

Storing it at home is even more out of fashion than it was in 1933. They don't need to knock on the doors, just like with criminalization of automatic rifles - people can either bring it in "voluntarily" or become "criminals". Very few people will risk it.

I don't spend much time here, just tune in once in a while to see what people are thinking. Out of these four options, I would rate banning cars to be the easiest one, then banning state-wide internet and finally banning bitcoin is the 2nd to hardest. (Turns out it's pretty tough to ban breathing, but it's appropriate on such list). Cars are the easiest to track and detect and super easy to identify the offender thus the easiest to ban. Internet is a bit tougher since after banning all ISPs and jamming the satellites you'd still get a Cuba-like interconnected pc network, like an intranet, not really an internet, but pretty close at the right scale, enough to share files with your friends, play games together etc. it's pretty hard task to track and stop movements. Even tougher would be to ban crypto, since you could use the semi-intranet network to run the nodes on each connection point and eventually your transaction broadcast would find an exit node to the "real" internet. Transactions would be slow, but it would still work.

To answers your question shorty, they don't. It is impossible to get around the issue of trust in fiat system. What they do is limit the amount you can buy per day and per trade and this limit builds up over time, kind of generating "trust". The better way to do this would be to make a feature where you have to deposit some amount of BTC and then upon buying it you have to time lock the same amount it for 30 days (and then have an arbitrage in case of any issues). That's the only way.

Someone buying the same commodity as you have, like gold, doesn't really benefit you in any way (apart from short time speculation). Someone owning the same currency, like bitcoin does benefit you and the whole community. In fact, a cab driver buying his first 0.1st bitcoin is much better for ecosystem than a hedgefund manager buy his 1000th bitcoin. When you hear of some small tourism-heavy country passing legislation for trades in USD, you don't go and dump it on the market, it's good for USD. Currency needs mass adoption to be successful.

It's not about price appreciation, it's about integrity. The more rapid and widespread adoption the better Gini coefficient we can achieve, which means wealth won't be so easily manipulated by the few and thus with it comes more integrity. Volatility is high as with any new tech and that's not a problem. And the thing about "wanting" bitcoin, real adoption comes when people realize they don't want it, they actually need it, literally need it to not starve to death. If you look up countries that got hit by hyperinflation or economic crisis in the past 8 years, they are the first ones to hop onto bitcoin train en masse. And here's the thing about price evaluation, if bitcoin has become necessity and it has very limited supply and current market cap is not enough to shelter all the capital fleeing currency crisis, government "currency manipulation" and unjust seizures (Venezuela, China, Greece, etc), then only option is for market cap to grow. And speaking of dollars, it's a pretty poor asset to be holding, last year alone it dropped by 10%, so it's more like a debt, not asset.

You're again talking about the impact, and not the feasibility. Banning Bitcoin is somewhat equivalent to banning people from talking to each other.

Would be an interesting challenge for some YouTube channel, trying to buy groceries with Bitcoin and with gold in random places in the world that accept neither (with no more than 50% premium). My bet is that bitcoin would have more success. You only need to download an app and show a barcode and verification &amp; transaction is done automatically, to verify gold you'd have to either call in an expert or at the very least get a bathtub of water and start doing density calculations.

It's basic economics, take any useless shit that has a transferability feature, attach scarcity to it and it's price will grow over time in a predictable manner, bitcoin has followed it's trend line ever since 2010, don't see any reason for it to change in the next 3.

The law is dealing with fiat because it's just simpler, the unique angle on this case in that during the bankruptcy period the assets still held by MtGox rose by 100x times in value.

Don't want to be rude, but the reason why Bitcoin Cash failed (and lets admit, it failed) is because it prioritized technically poor and temporary solution in the field of technical people. It's like seeing a building on fire and suggesting to build a couple more floors, because this way fire will take longer to engulf the entire building. Increasing block size would only last for a year or two at most, and then we'd have to increase it again and again and again, this approach is simply not sustainable. We can all admit that bitcoin failed to scale, and bitcoin has been failing to scale ever since it was released, every technology in high demand is under a permanent process of failing to scale, Tesla's production line is under constant process of failing to scale. Internet is under constant process of failing to scale. Bitcoin Cash was rejected not because it's suggestion was inherently wrong but because it would set a dangerou precedent for something that's not going to be welcomed in the future.

If demand falls worldwide there's not much they can do. However the short term strategy is always to sell gold/oil/foreign currency reserves to buy the dollar up, and this way keep it from entering hyperinflation. That's why countries who rely mostly on oil reserves for currency buybacks have currency issues when oil prices drop (Russia, Venezuela, Azerbaijan, etc.)

Well, if you stack the loans up (apply to many at the same time) you can get more than 30k, I'd say 50k-70k. And lets say in the developers jurisdiction debt collection time is only 3 years and not 7 &amp; he has saved up more than enough to ride it out, doesn't really matter how much he has saved up, 50k-70k is still some nice free cash that's up for grabs. Also, the developer might be living in Europe where credit ratings are prohibited so people are actually protected from having any issues like that.

So instead of keeping  anonymous and immediate money, you're forced to hold real estate, stocks, bonds, commodities - all of which are either controlled or overseen by a central government, all of which can be confiscated if this central party screws up with it's money management. It has happened and it will happen again. Every ponzi "works" until it doesn't, every government is "stable" until it isn't. The world needs to actual money not just a hot potato transaction medium, at the very least money needs to become what it used to be until the mid 20th century.

It's not bullshit, chain analysis can go very deep. A single tx 10 addresses down the line probably won't get you in trouble but over a relatively long period with many transactions, it will. It's not so easy to mix it all by yourself, if you're sending the exactly same amount withdraw for 10 addresses in a row, it will be tracked as a single transaction and will lead to deanonymization. It's best to use a coin mixing service, or to spin up a couple thousand of addresses and mix it yourself.

Any mobile wallet will do, as long as you use it to generate the seed, and don't roll out your own randomness, humans are very bad at making something really random. You can check out Samourai wallet or MyCelium, and I would suggest staying away from Copay and "[Bitcoin.com]( wallets. Desktop wallets are also more risky due to computers being infected much more easily so stay away from that. If you don't mind spending some $ then hardware wallets are a good option.

Banks will reimburse you if they can file a chargeback that won't be second guessed and audited. In the end the merchant is the one who's getting screwed (that the stolen funds were used to buy from, usually that's how it works).
Bitcoin will win in the poor areas because you generally can trust yourself more than the institutions or third party custodians over there and Bitcoin will in in wealthy areas because of "DISCOUNTS OVER HERE!!!". Merchants are super incentivized to use bitcoin as they can increase their profit margin by orders of magnitude. If a merchant is buying something for 100$ and wants to make 10$ profit he has to set price at like $135 using the traditional payment systems (10$ for payment processing, 15$ to offset the third party/chargeback risk). On the other hand if he accepts bitcoin he can set price as 111$ and end up with more profit, this is already happening, mostly in competitive markets, there's no surprize the airlines were the first who started  adopting bitcoin, even as far back as 2013.

Dollar get's it's value from:
1. The pegged/tied use cases that you can only do with dollar, like buying Saudi oil or paying US taxes - you can't do it with anything else, this creates a demand. To some extent you can also include stocks, bonds and a broader US market like steel, etc.
2. The US gov and other governments with good political ties to US buying dollar as a reserve currency, with intent of keeping their own currencies stable, this creates even more demand for it.
3. The trust that US will not print them out of control and will find other ways to manage the recurring economic collapses, backed up by historical data, this creates some level of trust.
Essentially, USD is king in a game of hot potato, it's one of the coolest potatoes there is, along with Euro and Japanese Yen, however in 21st century we shouldn't be forced to play hot potato with our finances and it's about time we move money to something with real value, like bitcoin.

They both show real dollar value. One shows the flat amount movements, the other shows actual % movements. If you're investor, you care how much $ you gained or lost, therefore you care about your investment amount multiplied by the percentage difference, and not about some arbitrary number tag. Non-log charts are only really useful when just want to see where the current value is at, and not to see historical movements over years/months.

@_date: 2018-12-26 19:49:05
Taking out your cash and buying bitcoin is not illegal, so not sure why'd you hide it. The OP was talking more about taking credits (free money printed out for inflation) and defaulting on them with an unseizable asset. Proving the ownership of bitcoins is a hard thing to do, almost impossible if the necessary precaution steps are taken, and seizing them is also next to impossible.
@_date: 2018-12-26 19:43:47
You can become judgement-proof after the loan. Imagine an open source/freelance developer who decides to work for 4-6 months in a top tier software company to be able to stack up some personal loans (w/o collateral), then buy some bitcoin (anonymously for cash), pay the debt payments for a couple months and then declare bankruptcy and leave job and continue working on the open source projects (for free). The only angle someone can go after is "where did you put the money?" and in most places you can get away with "I gambled it away", otherwise "I loaned it to someone and I don't remember who, I have a very bad memory". Even if they find traces of BTC purchase (unlikely) they still have to prove that you currently own it, which is even harder thing to do. Thing is, until now to seize assets you didn't need mind reading devices (or very effective and widely licensed torture). Now you do. I may or may not be in a similar spot ;).

There's no central authority that put a set of rules in bitcoin, no one is in control of it. All changes are discussed within the community and rules are developed to match the needs of the community.  When a minority disagrees and is unwilling to compromise then a fork is likely. Even if you're a superstar developer you can't commit in a change that doesn't have overwhelming support or it will simply be rolled back and your commit access will get revoked. There's also no central place where the access to anything means anything. In the past the devs were sending patches to each other via emails and distributing the software through sourceforge, now the github is being used, in the future it might be something entirely different.

Because it's not possible to make a digital fiat transaction that is final. Ever. 100 years from now you can still chargeback your payment on that coca cola you bought in local grocery store this morning. This incapability to have final transactions online means you need a party who can hire full cabinets of lawyers and capable of backing it's claims by large amounts of capital and clients. That's why exchanges are the necessary evil in this transition period, just don't keep your bitcoin on it, do the trade and withdraw.
