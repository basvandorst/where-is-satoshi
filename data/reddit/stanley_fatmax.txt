It's hard to say definitively, but it's very likely. With the current hash rate distribution, they'd only need to have agreements with the 4 biggest pools (3 really) to guarantee their high fee transactions go to a partner the majority of the time. It makes financial sense very quickly to artificially inflate fees when the mining pool is centralized on so few entities.

If you've been in this space for more than a year and you *didn't* make a killing off the past month, you're doing it wrong. Stop listening to people who just shout hold all day every day and take a second to realize your profits. Realize that the increase over the past couple weeks was ridiculous and it has to correct. Take some pride in the fact that you've invested, collect your earnings, and reinvest once this mania is done (Yes - mania. Not BTC, but the past couple of weeks).
Bitcoin will survive, as it always has. BCH will continue to be pushed, because it's successfully doing exactly what it was meant to do. It's the ultimate tool to manipulate the price of BTC. BCH was never meant to succeed. It's inferior to BTC and decidedly doomed to fail. That being said, it doesn't matter - BCH was meant to siphon BTC market capital when those controlling it decide to. They are making millions off these fluctuations. You'd be silly to not do the same. It doesn't even require putting money into BCH, just moving money around in BTC.

BCH fork didn't change BTC fees. The BTC chain theoretically knows nothing about the fork.
It's as if you're writing a book, and half way through, someone copies it all and starting from where you left off, writes their own story. You continue yours, completely separate. You can stop, they can keep going, or they can stop, you can keep going..
BTC fees are a result of demand skyrocketing. Unrelated to BCH.

It's your choice to use Coinbase though, and it's their choice to force high fees. They don't want to be on the hook when a users transaction doesn't confirm in minutes. Bitcoin users have the option to use exchanges that allow custom fees, or use their own wallets.

To move them out of the exchange, you'll need a wallet in general. There are desktop wallets, mobile wallets, physical hardware wallets, etc. Desktop wallets should only be used on secure computers (one you own, keep updated, and have anti-virus software on) and should be encrypted with a password at very least. Mobile wallets should never be used on rooted phones or phones with unlocked bootloaders. Physical hardware wallets are the easiest to keep secure, but can cost quite a bit of money.
Many desktop wallets will allow you to generate a paper wallet, if that's the way you want to go. Choosing the right wallet is definitely something important that you should read up on. Keep your coins in Coinbase/GDAX until you're confident in your understanding of wallets.

The alternatives all have bad fees too, so I wouldn't call it a flaw.. but yes, it is not ideal. In situations like this where instant confirmation is not needed, low fees should be used.
Lightning networks and off chain transactions are what segregated witness opened the door to. Once these types of systems are implemented, fees as we know them will disappear. Thousands of LN transactions can be settled on chain in a single BTC transaction... So figure a $1 fee split thousands of times.
Crypto is very much in its infancy still, and there is a lot of work to be done regardless of what you hear.
@_date: 2017-10-28 17:46:05
Their fees are explained here: 
Essentially, to avoid fees, you have to be a maker, which means setting an offer to buy that is below the current exchange rate. This is usually not difficult to do with Bitcoin as it's constantly jumping up and down. If the price is $5000, set a buy offer for $4999.50 and you'll pay no fees when it fills (which it typically will within seconds).
When you're transferring your BTC out of Coinbase/GDAX, transfer it all to GDAX and send from GDAX to avoid paying miner fees. GDAX covers them for you.

I mentioned it in another post but didn't get a response, maybe you have some input. I'm convinced miners may be behind spam. This is my understanding, so please correct and misconceptions.
First and foremost, higher fees benefit miners. So there is some interest for them to have higher fees. Flooding the memory pool with inexpensive transactions and variable fee rates forces exchanges like Coinbase to up their fee rates to ensure quick transaction processing. Do the miners then have an interest in this so called spam? A theoretical consortium of the top 10 mining pools would control more than 75% of the hashing power being spent on mining. They could theoretically then pool some funds to ensure a constant flow of 'spam' transactions. They're sending BTC between themselves, and reclaiming 75%+ of their fees, plus the now astronomically high fees the exchanges are fronting. At one point, my BTC-&gt;BTC transactions on Coinbase paying up to 350 sat/byte where transactions from my own wallets were being confirmed with less than 40 sat/byte in similar timeframes.
@_date: 2017-07-25 17:48:51
I'd be interested in seeing the cost/profit of the attack if it is indeed mining pools (independently or as a collective) inflating the fees. You would have to take into account the fact that a percentage of the fees are going right back into their pockets.
@_date: 2017-07-25 12:33:54
What keeps big mining collectives from flooding the pools with cheaper transactions in hopes of driving up the calculated fees on the exchanges used by the masses? At one point relatively recently, I was paying between $6 and $7 for tiny BTC-&gt;BTC exchanges on Coinbase, while at the same time getting away with $.40 fees in my own wallet with similar confirmation times.
Unless I'm missing something obvious, miners have a real interest in keeping fees high.
@_date: 2017-07-25 15:21:34
I don't know about this case, but I've seen people mention transactions of tiny amounts as being spam. It's typically coupled with the question, "what legitimate market transactions are trading amounts of Bitcoin worth a few cents?"

It's typically true in markets that the best time to make money or to "jump in" is when things are looking bad (or are being perceived as bad by investors, holders, etc.). It's too easy to profit off of hastily made decisions.

Don't take what I said as trying to time the market or you'll always be doomed to fail. Any short term flipping is essentially gambling. When people talk of markets and investments, it's safe to assume the discussion relates to long term investments. Just realize that individuals collectively make stupid decisions when things are looking rough. Where this happens, the opportunity for profit arises. We haven't seen this sort of case with Bitcoin yet. I'm talking more on the lines of market collapses. Think of the US housing market - billions of dollars were transferred over the course of a few weeks when people stopped holding and started dumping their homes and properties.

I'm sure the US government is going to be insistent on users providing detailed records of their trading and paying taxes on any income before coins are released. "Legal" trading in the United States is heavily regulated to begin with, and individuals trading outside of the legal market (BTC-e) are likely the targets of this seizure.

I'm still a little curious why people are surprised. Any American and most Europeans using BTC-e must have realized that it was unlike any other financial exchange they had ever used, and if they didn't, I have trouble believing they have ever used any online financial system. When have you ever been able to sign up for a bank account without providing any sort of identifying information?
As an American, even if you were solely buying sliced bread with your Bitcoin through BTC-e, you were still in violation of US law.

If you're leaving out sources of information, you're no better than people consuming *only* and Consume the word of all outlets, verify with sources (even if only briefly), and form your own opinion.

The top 10 mining pools contribute more than 3/4 of the total hashing power put towards mining. Even fewer than 10 working together could realistically profit from the 'attacks'
