Interesting. Do they take bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-06-09 22:58:40
Cool, didn't know about that option. I am going to look into setting up my node tomorrow, and see if I can measure in- and outgoing bandwidth in Linux.
@_date: 2015-06-10 13:07:41
IMHO the [upload bandwidth is a bigger problem than download]( for ordinary users with ADSL. It is a bit like a vicious circle, because fewer people running a full node means that the remaining full nodes gets a higher block sharing ratio.

Not in Berlin I'm afraid. The internet is quite crappy here.
@_date: 2015-06-10 13:10:41
Yes, I love Ubuntu too! :) Do you use any software to monitor your network usage over time?
@_date: 2015-06-09 22:55:22
Thanks for your insights. I have 20/2 ADSL right now (would love a fast symmetrical fiber line, but not going to happen in a foreseeable future). My only concern about running a full node is whether I still can use my internet line for other activities or it will ruin the quality of service. I think upload cap would be a good solution, because I would know in advance that I have some bandwidth left for other devices.

With metadata I meant stuff like source IP, packet size, etc., but I get it. Thanks for pointing it out! Increasing the redundancy is easy and basically drives the risk towards zero.

How many block headers do you need to store? If you store them all it's 25 MiB (block height * block header size), which might already be too much for some really low resource clients.
I agree with your viewpoint that you should use SPV when possible.
@_date: 2014-10-13 12:23:11
Yes, this might be the best choice. Just curious, did they implement this in the Trezor? If they did and it uses SPV, I would assume this device is very secure. If not (which I suspect), then the device is liable to the same possible attacks if used on an infected computer. There would be no way to tell.
@_date: 2014-10-13 11:16:05
As far as I understand, it's a way of encoding transaction scripts as an address. This means that anyone can pay to the address (starting with "3") and in order to use the funds, you have to provide the transaction script that matches the hash. This makes it much easier to implement and use multi-sig wallet like [BitGo]( and [GreenAddress](
@_date: 2014-10-13 11:12:27
There are many APIs out there serving the blockchain data in all kinds of formats and queryable in many ways, fx. lookup address transactions. As a developer, this is nice to build a low resource client. However, as a user, how can I trust these data sources? Isn't it dangerous that we have so many data sources, that can not be verified the same way the blockchain can? They are basically single points of failure.
To reframe the question: If I want to develop a bitcoin application that handles key signing only and SPV is too difficult to implement given some constraints, what is the next-best alternative? To present user with a list of API data source to select from?
@_date: 2014-06-17 14:28:38
I can only speak for myself, but as far as I understand you invest money and in return get tokens (shares). Those tokens represents an equity in the company. They can be traded, you get dividends, and can be used to buy special services the company offers for shareholders. This is what swarm wrote: [PDF](
@_date: 2014-06-17 14:20:46
I think you have to take into account the 4 confirmations (before you receive the swarm coins). It basically skews the transaction time.
@_date: 2014-06-17 11:43:17
Yes, I wondered about that myself. They [raised around 450 BTC before the public offering]( which makes the numbers match – almost, there is a 0.38 %-points difference. The shares does match however, as seen on this counterparty explorer:  (click Shareholders, the first address owns 75.462639 %, so it must be the vending machine giving out the coins).
@_date: 2014-10-03 09:56:19
Here's some minor issues as well:
@_date: 2014-10-13 12:01:16
I'm not so much worried about the data providers themselves, as I'm worried about a future, where third-parties really want to hurt bitcoin. The weakest link could be subverting these API endpoints, even in a small way that goes mostly undetected.
On the other hand, I really want to see the protocol implemented everywhere. Internet of Things and whatnot. For some low resource clients a blockchain data API might be the only option. I'm just exploring the area, and thinking about the best way to go about this. How little security can we trade for pragmatism?
@_date: 2014-06-09 18:39:18
That's an interesting graph. I like the fact that you can see the 2016-block moving average line up with the real difficulty for every adjustment. I guess Sathoshi or some other original programmers had a reason to make the adjustment every 2016 blocks instead of following the moving average. Maybe performance reasons, but on the other hand the calculation should only be done after each block generation. If the difficulty were calculated after each block, then the average time would be closer to 10 minutes in general?
@_date: 2014-06-09 18:32:52
Exactly, I think a sample of 2016 is needed to counter both statistical variance in block generation and the possibility of cheating by miners. But the difficulty could be calculated for each block. I'm just searching for arguments that it should be calculated in discrete steps (like every 2016 blocks).
@_date: 2014-06-24 14:00:29
Thanks, I read that. I'm not sure I understand how nodes are selected in a way that proves redundancy. It might not be an issue in practice, but it could be a risk if there are miners that are going to provide a lot of disk space. Let's say some Dr. Evil DriveMiner is going to turn on a data center that ensures he owns 35% nodes. The risk of all the copies ending up in the data center is 0.35\*0.35\*0.35 = 4.3%. This assumes a redundancy level of 3 and nodes selected at random. He is even paid as long as he hides his evil intensions of deleting the data or maybe even just making metadata analysis on the network.
It might be possible to build in some safety (like the proposals of more decentralised bitcoin mining) that ensures a highly decentralised storage network.

Please get EasyJet on board, they are big (and cheap) in Europe. That would be awesome.

Care to elaborate? I'll check them out.
@_date: 2014-10-06 12:16:58
Not until next difficulty change, or am I wrong about that?
@_date: 2014-06-09 16:41:55
I've used bitcoin for some time, but haven't figured out why the difficulty only changes every 2016 blocks. It could be calculated as a running average of the last 2016 and thereby give a more continuous difficulty value. If miners are added all the time and the hashrate thereby increases, then on average blocks are mined every 10 minutes in the beginning of a two week period, but less than 10 minutes in the end before a new difficulty is calculated, am I right?

How is the network sure that the data is redundant? Even with a redundancy level of 3, an evil organisation could start DriveMiner on a lot of computers with a lot of space and subsequently receive most of the files (the network see it as multiple nodes). I guess it's a somewhat similar problem to that of 51% hash rate on the bitcoin network hiding behind multiple pools. Although not as threatening (only for your safety of retrieving your data).

Are you going to release it as a website or open source? I'm interested.

No, bitcoin is not broken. As far as I understand, it is a cache based side-channel attack on OpenSSL, so the attacker needs access to your machine.

I don't like the “taxable” part and I am curios how it works, if not just another centralised coin, to be anonymous and taxable at the same time.

It says so on the [news page](


@_date: 2015-05-12 12:02:40
While I fully agree, I am afraid that their propaganda rings true to some people that think bitcoin is only related to tax-evasion and black markets (because media):

Yes, I am also thinking along those lines. I was just curious, since I haven't seen anyone discuss Taler on reddit before.

I would like to know if it's possible to do some setup before-hand to enable offline payments. Fx. if I setup a channel with the airline company, I could pay offline while in air (via NFC/bluetooth/etc)? Assuming the setup is a one-time thing and I could use it to pay for many travels.
@_date: 2015-04-17 12:19:26
In this context, I think it's worth mentioning decentralised organisations, autonomous agents, and smart property. Things that can be built only using crypto-currency technology. If these things are getting popular at some point, I think we would see a rapid increase in usage/price. As we are moving toward AGI (artificial general intelligence) in the next 15 years, we'll also see a rapid increase, because crypto-currency is programmable and decentralised. Ok, 15 years is just an estimate.

My fear is that the current banking system (with all it pitfalls) might evolve from a successful Bitcoin economy, which you state is entirely possible. What prevents us going in that direction?
@_date: 2013-08-28 11:20:53
I think it is entirely possible. The BTCs in reserve doesn't necessarily leave the bank. You get IOUs in your address, and you can't tell the difference from real BTCs. In order to use them you'll transfer them through the web interface, however the receiving address is managed by another bank, so only IOUs are transferred (through some kind of network). Of course, if you withdraw money to your private wallet, BTCs will leave the bank reserve, but as long as there's a stable customer base it doesn't really matter. I also found this link: 
However, I find this path dangerous, as it will lead to a more centralized banking system, just built on top of BTC.
@_date: 2013-08-28 07:36:07
Maybe so. If fractional reserves becomes the norm, the bitcoin economy will be inflated, which is a problem in itself, because someone controls that inflation and more or less controls the economy. The government might start a bitcoin central reserve to “ensure the continued success of the bitcoin economy,” when they really want is centralized control. Still far in the future stuff.

Have you looked at:  Maybe a bit overkill, considering your password, but they'll brute force your password for free and don't need the full wallet file. I read about the service on reddit some time ago, haven't used it myself though, so do the research regarding the security of sending (parts of) the wallet file.
