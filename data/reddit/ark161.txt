Not sure how to feel about that..seeing as he has a history of fucking everyone and everything he gets his mitts on.

transaction confirmations have to be confirmed on a mined block; at least that is my understanding.Think of it like this, there are a finite number of coin that can be mined until it is impossible to move on..so then me have this ledger that we can now have confirm...which with more transactions requires more nodes to validate and becomes one giant self fulfilling system.
The reason bitcoin or any cryptocurrency exists is because people mined that block and altcoins exist because they are vying for the same marketability/interoperability at a lower level because BTC is not really minable anymore unless you have fuck-all farms loaded to the teeth with ASICS.

Fuck son, I am pretty sure I am tearing a god damn ligament trying to not buy like a motherfucker
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:03:18
Enter your email to generate a fucking invoice/QR code ya dolt. As you are paying in BTC, it is accounting for the fact it will take some time to confirm the transaction. Otherwise, I just lost .007x BTC to one hell of a phish.
EDIT: Payment confirmed within 5 blocks, Invoice shows as paid via bitpay from Ledgerwallet. Not a phish

LOL, **bitcoin exists because of mining**...you can't separate the two because they exist because of each other. more bitcoin is generated by hashing calculations. Which, as difficulty increases, requires greater compute power (i.e. farms). This is the fundamental basis of all cryptocurrency.

And a method of utilization where stupid high Tx fees are not a thing.
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:45:42
$50 relative to what amount though? I mean, if you are sending $500 USD worth of bitcoin and the tx fee is $50 (10%) then hell that justifiable. Now if someone was sending &lt;$100 and the fee was $50..that is a bit absurd 
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:41:19
Oh I am, HODLing is not my problem at the moment. I am more shined off by people trying to justify Tx fees that are 60% of the actual Tx amount.
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:47:04
Just Hodl man. It was not a liquid asset and you would be sitting on it either way. Just go with the flow for a bit.

IRS sees it as taxable income if it is mined (which is bullshit). Any transference from one cryptocurrency to another is a taxable event...it is a fucked up landscape

I am still looking for someone to explain how segwit is not shady as hell. THey are saying that if you remove the signature from a 1MB block you can go up to a 4MB block...but that makes no sense...you still need the signature to verify the block, so where is that going? The only thing I can think of is that there is a separate  process tying the signature to the block like a debit card pin, or the signatures are stored in some centralized manner...
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:35:36
He isn't wrong...that was how I was when I mined my first coin and watched it soar. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:47:06
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:54:48
So in regards to the raw on-disk/transmit data, I am unclear how this would allow an expedient process/transfer. I mean, weight is kind of a strange way of looking at data. Wouldn;t it just be more efficient to say, last 10 verified tx signatures and call it good instead of rewriting how the whole thing works? Furthermore, regarding the segwit "discount", that is another point of contingency..what happens when that discount reaches the point of diminishing returns? Who is to say that it would not be further segregated into different tiers of transaction? Yeah, I am speculating a bit, but meh, I have seen enough fuckery to know three are entities pandering to get things done to solely benefit themselves. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 02:55:35
Upvoting because holy shit this needs to be spread. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:10:52
Hesitant to adopt because it is shady as hell. I mean, they are like, "we are removing the signature from the block to make it go faster"...but the sig is still required to be tied to the block in some form or fashion..soooo how does that happen? Is that signature being stored somewhere centralized? Because that is legit the only way I can think of that would allow that to happen in a fast manner.
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:33:56
except they define it as property so if you don't claim it, but claim the loss, you will get audited to oblivion....which, from what I understand, is just not fucking worth it.

It sure as shit is doing better than my space heater was lol

Banks have never, to my knowledge, charged a TX fee to use your deposit funds, withdraw funds, make purchased with your debit card, or otherwise. Their age has literally nothing to do with it, as the concept of is costing money to use the funds in any capacity will shine everyone off; hands down. Now, the argument of a brokerage fee (TX fee) based as a percentage of the TX is not unheard of and though it would keep most of the general public away from it, investors would still more than likely adopt the medium. 
See, that is the flaw in this whole concept. People want it to be adopted, but when the legit issues arise, everyone just says "deal with it, it is new tech". This is not about adopting new tech, but a large percentage of a share disappearing into the nether just "because new tech/network congestion". Imagine you have 100 shares of stock  valued at 15000/share and you are going to cash out 50 shares, but 20 of those shares go poof into the nether because of Tx fees....in what messed up kind of mindset would that ever be accepted? 
It isn't.

Meh, I understand that this is a market and there will be some losses. I am just glad to be here to be 100% honest. I know that down the line it will be worth it. Now if I can only get that .02 BTC nicehash says they are are going to pay us back and shapeshift would email me back...then I will be 100% solid.

As someone who is in the states, the only thing truly threatening cryptocurrency is the IRS taxing the fuck out of it 3 fold. 
* Property Tax - When you just own it
* Capital Gains - When the currency gains value
* Income Tax - If/When you cashout to fiat
No one is going to want to use this as a currency/investment when you can just buy standard stocks and get taxed less than you would if investing into crypto.
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:01:23
I guess I am looking at this in the sense of sending network packets across a network;a 1MB packet is still a 1MB packet regardless of how to arrange the data. So when they claim an increased block size due to rearranging the data, it raises more than a few questions. Right now, priority is given to those who have a higher tx fee as by nature those are supposed to have a higher ratio of transactions; at least that is my understanding of the source code anywho.

Why not deposit to paypal and then to bank?
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:32:01
they tax it as property...which is the BS way to to get around it..but then also want capital gains...and then income tax from cashing out...it is garbage...though I was thinking about it and I am pretty sure that if governments had their way, everything you own could be taxed as property tax....because "reasons"

@_date: 2017-12-22 21:18:11
That is kind of the irony though. It is that we have been conditioned to the traditional stock markets without thinking about the long term; crypto IS the long term. Everything new is confusing and this dose of reality I am personally grateful for ever sense the idea of "trading on futures" became a thing. 
If you can't laugh, then you cry.

DVD players were not trying to pass as a currency, but a commodity. There is a stark difference between the two. Think of Banking fees hiking up to $20 per transactions....shit would hit the fan.
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:32:10
Okay, but that still doesnt explain how placing a certain part of the block at the end (still inside the block...) does anything to enable greater capacity or efficiency. 
1MB is still 1MB. My understanding is that segwit does not just "re-org the block" but removed the signatures completely and then re-adds them somehow. I mean shit, you could accompish the same thing by limiting the witness data to the past 10 transactions...effectively killing the "growth of witness data.

...This makes no sense....A call for the government to regulate a commodity in no shape or form shows any incentive for today's youth to understand cryptocurrency. Their logic is that a school shooting occured, ban guns...they do not look at the psychological aspect of it...or the bullying...or the press to ace standardized exams....or the imbalance of work/social balance. They do not know what the current policies are or even care, they just want change....until said change comes back to bite them in the ass.

Hate to say it man, but this happens a lot in the securities market too.
