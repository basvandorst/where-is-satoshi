If there's anything that makes coinbase secure it's that they are using bitcoin to store your bitcoin. So removing them from the equation is ideal.

You won't understand the need for a decentralized stateless monetary system until your local government is failing you. The USD is pretty strong right now, bitcoin is probably much more beneficial in this sense to people of countries with a weaker currency. The great thing about bitcoin is you aren't forced to use it, it is all about choice.
@_date: 2014-03-29 21:30:01
What if you pay yourself on new address and tell the IRS that someone paid you for a service and you are spending it right away. Thus no capital gains or losses. 
@_date: 2014-07-29 17:25:38
Its deflationary by nature though, with a predictable inflationary period.  Unlike other units of money.
@_date: 2014-03-29 21:40:36
What do you mean a receipt? What if I offer a service online and someone from some other country that doesn't have to report their bitcoin expenses to the IRS decides to buy my service. I then want to turn that into USD. Since I'm doing it right away there is no capital gain or loss to calculate. All I have to pay is for the income tax? Now replace the person in the other country with yourself and you can easily evade taxes.  It's illegal but I'm sure people will do it.

Get a netbook, encrypt it or use virtual machines from a VPS you buy online. This device will be your laundering device. Never tell anyone about it. The IRS will have a hard time tracking that down. I think you are giving more credit to the IRS than they deserve.  Always launder via coinjoin, TOR, VPNs. Anything to remove yourself from the situation. I'm not advising this, I'm just saying how enforcing things against something as unenforceable and censorship free as bitcoin is as much as a pipe dream as the idea that you shouldn't have to pay any taxes on bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-01-16 07:27:59
Think though, this new currency would have an exchange rate with Bitcoin, would people still value Bitcoin more or want the bank-controlled alternative?  It may actually prove how little respect and confidence people have with banks.  They are better off accepting Bitcoin and working with it instead of fighting it.

Sending an invite to every single person right after we boom from the auction would be a good business move on their part.

Yes, people seem to be skipping those words, Bitcoin is just a piece of something very big that is forming.
@_date: 2014-03-29 22:04:02
Yes but the blockchain doesn't tell you who owns each address. And with tools such as coinjoin you are able to remove taint from coins and make even harder to track. How will they prove that you paid yourself and not some other guy that owned bitcoin paid you for a service? Especially if you clean and careful with how you file it. Be very hard to detect.

Coin base doesn't hold your used like mtgox does. That is why they are able to operate in the US. They sell you a bitcoin or give you their USD for your coins.  If they managed an order book and things of that nature they would not exist in the US and have the same issues as Gox.

Most businesses use Linux.  Mainstream consumer adoption is something moon shooters want.  Bitcoin is optional payment system, do you have a Discover card in your wallet?  Or a Diner's Club?  These are payment systems that people can choose to use, just like Bitcoin.  If Google made such a thing it too would have an exchange value against the Bitcoin, so I wouldn't be bothered by that.  Those who would still choose to benefit from what Bitcoin has to offer will choose to do so.  And when people go to websites and see Bitcoin prices are cheaper than any other way of paying for a good, they may start asking themselves why.

Discussing is very different than enacting.
That is why I said *future* risk since technology is only going to get better.  Believe what you what, but you are playing with fire if you think bitcoin is just magically going to protect you from tax laws. Maybe small bitcoin players can get by evading taxes but large scale real-world tax evasion doesn't seem likely.

In that case we better get rid of cash as well. Bitcoin doesn't make it easier to evade taxes, unless you are very careful (aka Joe Sixpack wouldn't even attempt it), even then you are running future risk with how blockchain analysis is sure to evolve.

I don't think this is very true, I mean I don't think many people can describe how email works, or text messaging, or most technology, or fiat money in general. I bet most people don't even know what the Federal Reserve does or how it works. What I see happening is bitcoin is slowly being subconsciously seen as the future of money and one day people are going to wake up, see it at a higher price, and not be shocked.  Bitcoin isn't going to fix the world's problems, but it sure will provide a sound balance against powers people can't really control.

680 shows signs of support. If you are patient. Could put a trailing stop around 782 and buy a new high cause in my opinion if it breaks there it will see 830 at least. Patience is key and what kind of time horizon you have in case things go poorly. If things get ugly can always sell so I say throw 5-10 grand on an exchange. If there was ever a time to do it it's now.

That makes a lot more sense, looks like you are probably laundering money, have you tried showing records of your arbitrage?
@_date: 2017-01-21 22:14:23
Bitcoin is just a tool to some people. They have no emotional attachment or desire to hold one. And that's okay.
@_date: 2017-01-14 23:51:23
@_date: 2016-06-17 23:47:45
Imagine coming to this echo chamber you are looking for someone to tell you to pull the trigger. Your best bet is to come to the conclusion that you want to buy bitcoin based on your own due diligence.

Never too late.

As far as I've seen blockchains without bitcoin are all hype, prove me wrong otherwise. If anything its a trojan horse to limit exposure to praising bitcoin in its nascent era. In the long run it would be like trying to have the Internet without praising the idea of IP addresses.
@_date: 2017-01-23 03:28:11
I hope the devs are aware of this issue.

Actually it rallied after that, it fell once PBOC banned financial institutions from touching bitcoin, a banned they loosened in late 2015. Also the mtgox hack lol.

Been waiting to see a structure like this for awhile, wish GDAX pay attention.

Use a tool like  or 
@_date: 2017-01-08 17:45:54
So is bitcoin. Ether is an unnecessary new speculative asset, more or a sandbox for developers to find use cases to later integrate on top of bitcoins value and security network.

@_date: 2016-12-03 14:24:16
Can you guys have this tool integrate with GDAX? Be very helpful.
@_date: 2016-11-18 19:42:36
This is actually good news

Isn't it digitally possible though?

I'm sure you are real fun at parties huh?
@_date: 2017-01-02 00:10:05
Indeed. Bitcoin has been perpetually expensive since before it broke dollar parity. No one has a clue what they are worth.
@_date: 2016-12-11 03:34:48
You know people can pay their taxes on bitcoin right?

Yeah might as well just put money in there. Oh wait.
@_date: 2016-11-20 16:56:02
So I suppose they were right in the end? Users look to be making the right choice XD
@_date: 2016-12-24 21:18:05
There are better services.
@_date: 2016-11-23 20:56:06
Yes. I remember having to walk into wells fargo and deposit into bitfloor's account and get weird looks lol, but moved em right to gox, was cheaper than how bitinstant was gouging customers back then. They got hacked pretty quick.
@_date: 2016-11-24 16:12:53
Who told you that? You were sold on false hopes, only people who use bitcoin will influence the price so if this is what people are assuming they are in for a wake up call. People that understand the protocol know whats going on, so if anything this will be an educational lesson to the ignorant, and considering how ignorant they are I'd imagine they don't even have much value in bitcoin and are just playing around with the idea. So its pretty moot.
@_date: 2016-12-09 00:27:43
No. it's patenting

Kind of a paradox since stability is logical for confidence.

Yeah cause people don't think bitcoin faces the same manipulation.  Also bitcoin is there for people and has been proving that. Are you trying to rush something?

I'd care more about volume growth. What's with your misplaced anger though homie. Bitcoin doing great.

Miners can't even flag support until the 15th right? They matter much more than all the other nodes. 
@_date: 2016-12-09 18:43:43

Let alone the fact that gold is just an element, who's to say some smart guys out there haven't figured out how to produce gold cheaply and inflate the market? There would be incentive to keep this technology quiet, and theres no way to prove if it does or doesn't exist. Meanwhile bitcoin is restricted by math and instantly verifable as long as you have an internet connection. Let's see how this plays out on a long enough timescale :) :popcorn:

New round of noobs are here. Was nice when bitcoin was "boring", now I just sound like an oldphag.

@_date: 2016-12-19 13:29:05
Fed/USDCoins would be no different than USD is today, just backed by a blockchain, it will still need to trade against Bitcoin if it wants to consider itself "money".  The exploration into "blockchains" just further proves the viability of a blockchain securing a decentralized asset, but to be honest, I see a blockchain without bitcoin as the Internet without IP Addresses, a naive viewpoint on the learning curve.

This is the board of directors and he's still surprised? He must be thick af, or he's just trying to get some from PR.  Regardless I'm loling over here because 1) it shouldn't be news if a company accepts money as payment, so bitcoiners should stop caring if such things happen 2) this is just vague tweets, not like press release or something.
@_date: 2016-11-15 13:19:00
CME share price been soaring. Probably mostly cause futures markets will see a lot of volatility during trump administration, but other exchanges like NDAQ and ICE have not been moving like CME, maybe this bitcoin index is some icing on the cake.

So it's like all forms of money?
@_date: 2015-08-03 15:35:15
Whats laughable is people not understanding the concept of a digital asset that doubles as medium of exchange with predictable scarcity built into it and what implications that brings as knowledge and confidence in that asset spreads.  The self-fulfilling prophecy can only be proven, or disproven, with time,  is a good read.  Before we jump into arguments about altcoins and competitors, good rule of thumb is following the "sound money" with the most power (mining) backing it.

This is true as well, I've read articles about people that use dollars for this purpose as well, it doesn't mean this article doesn't bring up valid points.  This is how bitcoin slowly creeps its way into the world, small speculative attacks that are based upon sound logic of sound money turns into an exponential curve as more start to understand this logic with more confidence. Sit back and acquire bitcoin slowly.

Other blockchain technologies will only help prove the viability of blockchain technology securing a decentralized digital asset, a value token system. I'd love to see a permissioned ledger try to do that and gain the same sort of network effect. It will have to trade against the bitcoin if they both want to compete for value. Interesting game were in :)

Anyone have any opinions of 1DkyBEKt5S2GDtv7aQw6rQepAvnsRyHoYM dropping 100,000 BTC recently? And also having a balance of ~500k coins prior to that?  Seems to fit for pirate, I've always seen that address belonging to Silkroad but at this point I have no idea what to assume :|

He makes some valid points, don't get me wrong I am a huge supporter in Bitcoin and have accumulated a good amount over the last two years, but really the three main driving factors of Bitcoin currently is SilkRoad, gambling and speculation.  There's a lot of people that buy Bitcoin with the intent of just storing them until they can trade them back for whichever fiat currency. And in the long run, this hurts Bitcoin. They should be actively spending them, while getting more merchants to accept them.
Then SilkRoad, which, in my opinion, is a great addition to society, has a HUGE market share in the Bitcoin economy.  It's been proven that  was at one point SilkRoad's hot wallet until it got too much attention and they washed the coins out. Who knows how many coins they have control of but I imagine many of the large transaction you can see in the blockchain are from them, and many of the 10,000 BTC addresses you can find in the blockchain belong to them.  If SilkRoad were to be shut down (which seems and is very unlikely in the near future but it is a feasible scenario), all the coins would be lost due to the fact that DPR would probably walk away with the profits (that is if he isn't in jail).  Of course other sites would pop up, such as sites that already exist like Black Market Reloaded, but imagine the time it would take for the SilkRoad community to migrate/even know of "safe" alternatives. I imagine many would be spooked and the media would play it as a huge victory and instill more fear into the public.  And probably use Bitcoin as an example of what criminals and drug dealers use to steal the taxpayer's dollar.
So yeah, thats my 2 satoshis. Theres a lot of people that blindly support Bitcoin and really need to look at how fragile this system is.  If we want the day were our Bitcoin is worth $100 or even $1,000 each we have to make it seem less of a ponzi scheme/drug dealers paradise and more of an actual good in society.

I strongly believe that he was behind the 157k BTC buy wall we saw the other week on Mt Gox (  I believe that the quick rise from 5 to ~11-15 USD threw him off and he was unable to continue to manipulate the market as he pleased. People pretty much wised up.  But I do believe we will see a big buy wall again sometime soon, he's wants the price to go down.

Wouldn't call it a fork of Bitcoin since it has its own blockchain.  Its like a brother, Gold to Silver.  Except I see low value in LTC considering there isn't much you can do with it besides horde it, gamble it away, or trade it for BTC or fiat.  I think once GPU miners get replaced by ASIC technology we will see a LTC bubble that will crash pretty ridiculously.  Buy in now and ride the scare or don't bother.
Just my 2 satoshis.

The price is already too high to begin with, if you watch the walls on MtGox you can see that someone will deep pockets is manipulating the price and keeping it at 11.70.  There just isn't enough demand, sooner or later the bears will win and the price will fall.

In time this will improve, right now it's expensive to accept such a thing because doing so requires you to use archaic systems.  BitInstant could probably afford to lower their fees.  I'm upset that Bitfloor's Wells Fargo account got frozen, that was the easiest and cheapest way for me to get Bitcoin for a while, I believe it was a .4% transaction fee.  Only a matter of time till a service is made, hey maybe you should make it?

Not necessarily... its easy to dismiss but volume has also been picking up elsewhere such as itBit.  High volume and no movement can also easily mean happy trading levels between old whales and new whales.

People not using bitcoin doesn't hurt bitcoin. Only people that use it influence it. So it's a nonissue in my book. People who overspeculate on mainstream adoption are the only ones that get hurt.

ACH is US only, international banks laugh at such an aged system. That was also my point, processing money moving between different banks is what takes the 3 day confirmation. They could upgrade it, sure, but they haven't.

You act like the payment system is what makes bitcoin so revolutionary. Not the whole first trustless state-less cryptographically sound digitally scarce asset the world has seen. Long term I could see Visa just piggybacking on top of bitcoin, helping move their ownership and being part of whatever society comes up with. Visa isn't a competitor, its simply on the chart for benchmarking purposes.

Would Coinbase not be able to reap the 1 hr ACH transfer benefits? (I suggest you look up the systems that power ACH, they have purposely not been upgraded in decades.)

This is all sidetracking and beside the point, would coinbase not have access to the faster ACH transfers? The answer is they would, and if they didn't they'd partner with a bank that did. It's like you said, a poker game where you don't show your hands till you need to.

@_date: 2016-07-05 16:09:30
If you start moving money out of your bank account in loads its called structuring and they will definitely ask where its going. I believe bitcoin has more precautions due to the fact that bitcoin is rapidly gaining value so the threshold in which such questioning is needed is approaching faster.

@_date: 2016-07-01 18:44:27
On what grounds would such a law be passed? Banning the use of some computer code? Why such fear? Is it cause the existing system is so fragile that a sound system isn't allowed to exist? If such a law got passed it would really be shooting whatever country tried passing it in the foot. But I'd love to see the effort.

Who cares about 21, the fact that asic chip development has caught up to moore's law means that we should see distribution of high end chips since fabrication facilities aren't always developing the next generation as the offload the last to the fools. We should now see more clear development cycles of asic chips to match those of CPU and GPUs, 12-18 month cycles. Meaning soon if people want to just jump into the mining game they shouldn't be getting ripped off as bad as they once were, more level playing field.

What would happen is the people that pay more fees would get into blocks sooner, it would make miners be looking for people that are willing to pay more to get into the next block.  So it wouldn't be the end of the world, it would just be a bottleneck, and is a problem that is known and being improved.
@_date: 2013-10-14 05:56:34
Thank god services like Coinbase, and many exchanges allow you to maintain a balance without flooding the blockchain.  But I agree, sometime soon we may face the horrors of reaching the block size limit and the price of getting into a block (fee) goes up, but everything will still be operational.

I believe they're saying ASICs are messing with the short term rate at which coins are being mined, and once the growth balances out and difficulty can properly adjust to the new ASICs coming online, it will return to the constant, proper, 1 block per 10 minutes rate.

Hey Reddit, I am looking for beta testers to find any bugs in the system and to stress test my server.  I will be actively following and am easily accessible on here, the bitcointalk forum, or IRC (my name on freenode is zoinky).
The forum thread has been created here: 
@_date: 2013-09-26 14:44:53
Not sure what you mean, ASICMiner has made a lot of investors money, sure some of the laggers lose out and are holding an expensive bag, but it seems the share price likes to hover around 30% ROI, so do the math yourself and buy/sell accordingly.  Buying and holding is a strategy, but being a trader I know I can make more money over time buying low and selling high.
And yes it does help the bitcoin economy, people holding planning to just sell later at a higher price is not good for the bitcoin economy.
@_date: 2013-11-19 23:34:37
I agree cheating is a losing battle, cheaters will always try to cheat.  There are things we have planned to create more of an incentive not to cheat, such as a referral system.  The site may become invite only if cheating becomes an issue, and if you are inviting cheaters you lose invite privileges as well as benefitting from your current refers.  We have other plans in place in order to catch cheaters that I'm not going to comment on right now.
In the end, this is the beta and we are trying to see what comes from this idea before we branch out and start executing other additions to the site.
If cheating is a huge issue for you, I suggest only doing Versus Mode against people you know aren't going to cheat. You can do this by using Private Matches.

Why not look for a off-exchange transfer with someone that is willing to sell a lot more coins? Work out much better for you.

Gox has been through a lot, wouldn't be surprised if they are around for a very long time.
@_date: 2013-11-20 04:06:33
Maybe in the future, we have been discussing it but do not have plans to do such during the beta.

I'd agree with this entry point, but with friedcat announcing 500 TH/s in October, that looks more and more unlikely.  We shall see.

Pretty awesome, as USB ASIC technology gets better you will be able to upgrade this and have 100% profits.

Anywhere I can view these? Are all the exchange you've been watching on Bitcoincharts.com?
@_date: 2013-01-27 19:49:15
Wonder when this will peak...

Reddit gold must be cool.
@_date: 2013-09-09 06:31:37
No but it sparked a series of news stories that got a big group of people to look at bitcoin more seriously.

Feel free to help a brother out.

What about all the passthroughs that profited off his scheme?

So were gonna use the gravity from the moon to catapult us to Mars? I like it.

It's saying that yes, you could have planted a tree 20 years ago and it would be great if you did today cause you could have the effect of a 20 year old tree.  But you didn't plant that tree 20 years ago, so don't wait another 20 years and be upset once again, do it today and its just as good as planting it whenever.  It's saying don't dwell on the past and make decisions now.  I could have probably worded that nicer, but that's the gist of it.
@_date: 2013-08-18 05:03:57
If things aren't discussed, how do you expect them to be fixed?
@_date: 2013-06-11 19:40:49
160 TH/s, with the given timeframe I think it will be a slim chance of too much of a profit.  But what do I know...  I'll just chill on my ASICMiner shares.

Someone believing Adam's speculation?

Yet if you want to be VIP on the site its a flat 50 BTC fee, no matter what the exchange rate is.  Seems fair..
@_date: 2013-11-20 00:41:44
As in allow you to define a deposit address? Like add private keys? You can already withdraw to any address you choose.  Currently withdraws are handled manually.
@_date: 2013-03-01 01:46:47
Willing to bet on that? I bet we will see 20 before we see 50.

CWZ 6LF != BITCOIN?
@_date: 2013-11-25 18:43:29
We paid a flash vendor for our games, theres hundreds of flash game sites doing the same thing... If a developer comes along and has a game they would like to add we'd love to setup a payment plan for them.

Or been perfecting a trading algorithm for months...

Well it lacked some of the things that made it successful, so I would compare Napster to e-Gold and Bitcoin to BitTorrent :)
People exchanged files on the Internet well before Napster.

Good discussions over there.  Its important to get all the possible views you can about to something like Bitcoin, just reading things on bitcointalk and will leave your opinions highly biased.
@_date: 2013-02-10 04:05:34
Feel like it would just be easier to hop onto Bitcointalk for this stuff.
@_date: 2013-11-20 00:21:10
Sorry for the delay, haha. Many more features and games to come!

Don't scan and drive people.  This is an accident waiting to happen.
