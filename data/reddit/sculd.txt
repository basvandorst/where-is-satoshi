Are hong kong natives working in those startups or is it mainly guys from UK?

I am not a professional at all. Intrigued by the recent surge in the cryptocurrency prices and got some serious interest in investing in it.

Can you please be more specific? Some example?

what does it mean for us on the practical level?

Yeah that makes sense, paying the tax only for the final revenue right? But I see a few articles like this:  that implies (unrealistically) conservative implication.

Thank you, some questions.
As for 'Gains', does the gain only include the surplus dollar value? i.e. Do I need to pay tax when converting the bitcoin back to the fiat currency when the bitcoin price has not changed?
As for the tax deduction from the loss, I am not very familiar with the practice, is the 100% of the loss deductible? i.e. Do I have to worry about losing money solely from having to pay the tax on the winning trades when I have the equal number of the losing trades?

Yeah that's a good call indeed.
