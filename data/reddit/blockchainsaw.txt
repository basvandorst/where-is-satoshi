Congrats! I was really close but you got there before me.

Ai Caramba, this is not easy. Cleaned em up again and got the same 2 so I guess I was right. I am going crazy here!
@_date: 2013-12-06 09:50:25
At the sound part as well!!!! Awesome!

Lol, "Awaiting clue  patiently. Will not post unless I get a break through".. haha
@_date: 2013-12-06 11:20:54
Thanks for the tip. Still can't get them to scan. Tried everything.

Is this geocaching thing leading somewhere? Or do I need another angle?
@_date: 2013-12-06 12:09:37
No unicode in the second one for me!
@_date: 2013-12-06 10:51:43
I lost it at the spectrogram. Are you supposed to be able to scan those qr codes?!
@_date: 2013-12-06 09:39:43
Finally got there! Lots of fun! Shoot, I am stuck at the locked part.... is clue 3 the only for that part?
@_date: 2013-12-06 12:36:29
Yes, please btcfun. Give us the next clue!
@_date: 2013-12-06 10:04:57
Same with me... 
@_date: 2013-12-06 13:05:28
I keep getting empty geocache searches... So close but I can't get it...
@_date: 2013-12-06 11:59:19
I got a decimal number and can't seem to get the second one...
@_date: 2013-12-06 13:09:47
Hmmm. I'll clean m up again. Hopefully I'll get different numbers.

There is no bitcoin organization that is making revenue. The people own the coins so they get revenue. This is one of the reasons why Bitcoin is different from other currencies.

I have the same problem! I tried everything..
@_date: 2013-12-06 10:32:40
Got it. Hmmm can't scan it ... yet!
