His grammar is so messed up, it's really off putting. I had attributed the awkward communications from Mt gox over the past few years to their being in Japan, assuming they were non native English speakers. Now here's Karpeles bumbling his way through this email interview... my goodness. He really comes across badly.

What you're describing is  . The problem is that currently it is impossible to get USD out of Mt Gox, so their price difference can't be exploited. On the exchanges where it is actually possible to withdraw in fiat, the process of withdrawing and depositing takes longer than the market swings we are seeing.
