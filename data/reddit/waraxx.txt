I've heard it for a few months now. although It's not a crypto as you say.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:37:38
I saw 19.7K...
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:31:47
well, enlighten us then.

LN is needed asap...
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:40:48
Amazing.

I don't envy the tech guys right now. poor sods.

in case the app recorded your seed and store it then they'll now potentially have a record of your seed as well. this is why you want to generate your paper wallet with a popular opensource generator on a secure offline computer (preferably a live-USB of some kind. 
it's kind of a hassle, but it's the only way to truly know that you are the only one with access to your own wallet.

a 500$ swing is still just a 3-4% swing which isn't unheard of.
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:28:42
well, the market always adjust so that 50% of the people think it'll be worth less, while the other half thinks it'll be worth more. if 99,99% of al the people would think that it's worth less then the current price then the price will adjust until it's 50/50 again. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:46:23
I don't get it, can't you just choose to not use it? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:44:31
I see 17K. I text a friend about it and all exchanges are unreachable.
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:41:29
is this weighted according to market volume?
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:54:40
I'd bet that if you want to buy some then they would hold your order until the next price adjustment and then process all the orders instantly, same for selling. so, it's for long term (2&lt;) days and not trading like gdax.
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:47:16
that's just +-2%, that's nothing.
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:43:41
what is new? bitcoin being volatile...?
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:13:29
it actually implies that approximately half of the the people think it'll be higher and the other half thinks it'll lower. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:35:19
Apart from making it illegal. I'd have nsa/Cia hack/infiltrate and disrupt major hashing networks/nodes while simultaneously disrupting those I couldn't breach. I'd then put all that hashing power into trying to hack as many wallets as possible for a week until the network realises that the hashing power have been significantly reduced and then go to town and undoing as much as possible.
Every effort to make bitcoin synonyms with uncertainty and insecurity.

Any system that doesn't require me to say "zero point something". preferably you should never have to say any decimal number unless you are doing financial calculations. A coke should cost somewhere between 10 and 100 units of money. 
@_date: 2018-05-02 03:41:53
yeah, fair enough. you'd still have to wait for a few minutes until the next block unless the vendor is willing to trust in that the payment will go through.
@_date: 2018-05-01 23:21:49
anyone who think that bitcoin without some kind of scaling solution will function as a payment instrument is deluded. 
we have 2 options for now. until something better presents itself which I doubt.
**Behind door number one:** Flexible block size! blocks have to be large enough to contain all transactions that anyone would want to do. the clear disadvantage with this is that for anyone to verify the legitimacy of a transaction would have to download petabytes (yes, you read that right, thousands of terabytes) of history. which would lead to a failure of decentralization. it also comes with the clear disadvantage that any pending payment would have to wait for the next block to be mined before being accepted which would take minutes. and that is best case scenario. currently the rule of thumb for most vendors is to wait until the payment is at least 5 blocks old before accepting it.  
**Behind door number two:** some kind of an off-chain solution! instead of tying every single transaction to the block-chain there are many other individual block-chains that keeps track of peoples payments and then after some time execute all these payments as one sum of it. This solution is not entirely explored yet, we don't know what works and what dosen't work. The technology is as of yet not fully explored (I don't think). However, I do think there are a few disadvantages that this would bring with it. The full extent of these disadvantages is yet to be determined. It is worth noting though that these disadvantages would be exclusive to those actually using the off-chain solution and anyone who wishes to use bitcoin without this is free to do so.
personally. I don't think door number one is an option. we need something like Lightning-Network on top of the bitcoin protocol to act as bank-notes like bank-notes used to be to gold. bank-notes were not gold, but it were proof of ownership of gold and was therefore valued as such. sure, LN have a lot of flaws. it has weaknesses that can be exploited to steal others funds. but, carrying around cash that could very easily be taken from you was the way of life for decades. yet, very few people would save all their money at home in a box. We have to accept that with security comes inaccessibility and with accessibility comes insecurity. bitcoin is as safe value can be. you'd have to spend eras finding something that doesn't belong to you. LN is the middle ground for small everyday payments. yes, when you buy a car or a house for bitcoin the vendor might insist on doing it directly on the main block-chain and wait that day for confirmation in the interest of security. but when I'm ordering a sandwich at subway the transaction have to be close to instantiations and have a reasonably high certainty of actually getting confirmed.
If we don't find a working off-chain solution then bitcoin is doomed and will remain as a rumor that is (lets be honest) mostly used by criminals to stay anonymous.

It definetly won't stop you from being an asshole though.

Scale out to 5 years and you'll see that the ups and downs we see now are essentially just noice.

2, well, I'm not an pure libertarian. I think the government is an essential thing in a human society. but, I'm not going to go into discussing ideologies on the internet. been there done that. 
3, hm, that's actually a really good point.    
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:04:46
I doubt it would work to have a state without a government that collect taxes. but hey, personally I belive the future lies in universal income which could be equally nuts... so who am I to judge. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:32:01
yeah, well, so is gold, but it only gains value if everybody have the necessities. and that was kind of my point. the point of prepping is the idea that there won't be enough for everybody in a doom scenario. nobody would trade ammo for a jewelry at any resonable ratio if ammo is scarce.  
@_date: 2017-11-21 13:34:38
Yeah, like putting people in prison for drug use is wrong, but putting larger drug dealers behind bars is a given... No? Drug should be fought, but punishing the victims (the addict) is the wrong way to go about. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:31:03
mh, yeah, I suppose it could work, although It pretty much relays on an super fair start. if you leave things to them self then money breeds more money, and the money has to come from somewhere, until some day people live where they work and get payed with food and viola, slavery.
and as to ppl paying for stuff they don't use, well, other people pay for stuff you need that they don't. and some times it's better to pool money rather then everybody buying one for them self.
but I'll respectfully step out of this conversation now if you don't mind.
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:56:56
surely, Doomsday preppers wouldn't have gold anyway... what's the point of having gold in a doomsday situation? the best investment to make if you truly belive there could be a doomsday situation in your lifetime would be solar cells. cells is the shit to hoard. not only can you use them now, they would be one of the most important things to have for QoL when the power grid is down. given that you already have access to the basics like water, food and shelter.

Sure, marijuana really shouldn't be banned but what about heavier stuff like cocaine or meth? Surely those must be so harmful that dealing them should be given serious prison time. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:49:37
hehe, ops. mbad. large numbers is confusing.
@_date: 2017-11-23 21:41:11
replace bitcoin with gold and you could have the same argument.
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:55:35
well, yeah, in the US of A this might be the case but where I'm from the rich taxes a lot more than the poor and therefore off sets some of the disparity. we still have a fairly big financial differences but this is mostly due to political and social issues and not the fault of financial principles.
the fundamental issue in america is that you guys have inflation of prices but not inflation of wages. this is a serious issue, but again I stress, this is an issue of government policy rather than faulty financial principles.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:21:55
seriously, I get that Bitcoin is in an upward trend, but Bitcoin ever reaching $1 Million is slightly delusional unless of course the dollar experience a serious amount of inflation. nevermind in 3 years...
$1 Million dollar coins would put the market cap at $20 Trillion which is more than the combined market cap of all the coins/bills in the world and all the gold in the world And you'd still have some 5 Trillions to go.
I could maybe, maybe, see $100,000 per BTC by 2020, and longer term possibly $400,000 if Bitcoin keeps it current number one spot among crypto currencies.
I don't expect the Bitcoin to take over the worlds currencies. although, I can absolutely see Bitcoin play a major role in the future if Bitcoin can stabilize in value and solve it's scaling issue with something like Lightning Network. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:19:48
 you think inflation give money to the rich? isn't it rather the opposit? that if someone sits on their money without spending it their wealth will decrease through inflation. inflation, intentional or not, encouraging using money instead of hoarding the money that we do in the bitcoin market now and thus leading to very high volatility and an stagnation in the market. 
and how the government spends their budget is a political question and not a financial one.

Nvidia have been a solid stock for a a while now and is a stellar long term investment. short term I've got no clue, but say he buys now and hodles for 3 or so years then it's more or less guaranteed to give excellent returns. 
now, the down/upside with Nvidia is that it's tied into the amarican economy and given wall streets record and trump/repubs talking about deregulation it's not implausible to see a severe crash in a decade or so. leading up to the crash there will be good growth. so short term nobody knows anything, long term it'll go strong along with the rest of the economy and the very long term it's a bit unstable due to the wall street factor but this largly depend on the following president/majority in the houses. so going +39% within a medium time window is kind of likely, I give it 65-75% chance. 
Bitcoin on the other hand is very risky at all time scales because of the nature of being in the beginning of a new technology. even if blockchains is here to stay who knows which one will actually end up as *The Currency* short term however it's bitcoin that is on everybody'slips and most growth in the cryptocurrency world will be given to bitcoin unless a superior technology is released. going +92% within a medium timeframe is unknown (50% chance), It'll either go -70% or +500%. I doubt It'll stay where it is now, It'll either increase dramatically or crash. 
TL;DR I'd not take the bet if you're interested in best result, although I recommend doing it anyway since it sounds like a fun thing to do with a dad :)
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:13:23
surely, using a different currency dosen't change how the government operates, and what you seem to want is freedom from a government rather than an different type of currency.  
@_date: 2017-11-22 08:46:19
if the trendline is to be trusted, we should expect a +100% price surge soon-ish... mmhhh idk, not sure if I'm that bullish. it would be interesting to see the trendline with the insane spikes removed. the spread against the trendline we see it being stable around 50-60% of the trendline and when it's not at that stable value it fluctuates like crazy.
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:13:17
yes I agree, and the next major financial disaster instigated by banks will set the safety of the largest cryptocurrency in bedrock but until then the games is still very much on to see if something can rival bitcoin either through superior technology or better financial integration. and if bitcoin is taken over, then it'll lose value, but if it remains the largest cryptocurrency until the next crash then the gains will be humongous, so in the long run we are either looking at a huge value increase or a gigantic crash. And since speculation about the future regarding popularity is nothing more than guesswork I'd still give it a 50/50 chance. however, if it's given that bitcoin will remain the largest bitcoin for the foreseeable future then yes, the increase in value is as close to guaranteed as it can get.
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:36:34
yeah, good Idea to step away from that. I just think that some issues are rooted in political issues rather than the fundamental of the financial principles. and that's what I was arguing for. not which policies are harmfull/helpfull.

The US national debt isn't so bad yet, 100% of gdp isn't out of control. Especially not since it's in a currency that the US control. Japan is at 200% debt and sure, they have a serious issue but they are dealing with it since their debt is mostly to the citizens much like the US. People saying that the US is owned by China is just fear mongering.

Eh, while I understand what you are saying. I'm not really sure that bubble is the correct term for what's going on. Yes, if bitcoin was an ordinary asset then it would absolutely be in a huge bubble. But it's not an ordinary asset. It's a storage of value more similar to gold. And gold have also been in a "bubble" for a long time. 
@_date: 2018-07-17 22:44:07
What debt is out of control? Citizens debt or the national debt? 
@_date: 2018-07-08 20:23:59
if you use bitcoin just to avoid taxes your going to have a bad time.
