Great question! Please check this video. It answers your questions without even mentioning bcash. I found it extremely didactive. Worth the time if you are interested in the topic.  (delivering liberty, at scale)

I  am not sure how that is of any help for laundering money. The closest to this would be buying a $100 winning lottery ticket for $130

How is his address himom? Can you choose it?

Ok cool, I get you now! Very interesting indeed. This reminds me something I read somewhere about the value of Bitcoin. It was that it is a system that allowed safe transactions without having to trust the other party.  Now it is being used for buying and selling, but society involves much more transactions than just that.  Good post!

Thanks! Great answer (though i will definitely need to re-read it several times more to get everything :)

There was a recent article about a police chief somwhere in the US who asked to be paid in BTC and they accepted.  It sounded a bit weird the whole story, but they said that the employer first paid all due taxes in regular dollars, and what was left was then paid in BTC to the employee.
Regarding the Spanish info,   has pretty much all you need to know for starters.  Maybe it is not explained for dummies, but I think it is the best way to really understand what all of this is about.

I like your analogy of fire, but I got lost when you brought in the Oculus Rift into the equation.
I Like the concept that the value of the bitcoin is not how many dollars it can be changed for, but the community that is building a new economy around it.

So basically we are "brute force hashing" values until someone gets the correct key?

Ok ok... english are not my first language...

Ooook, so that is what that famous proof of work means. Thanks :)
So then... this means that miners are unsuccesfully hashing the same values over and over again? Or is there some sort of global database where miners share the key-hash value of previously unsuccesful attempts? In that case, couldnt that massive database also be used to "unhash" other unrelated hashes like passwords?
Not sure if i explained myself correctly.....
Let me put an example.  But first let me check if I understood correctly the concept of proof of work.
Lets assume that SHA(123)=xyz. Then, I understand that the proof of work is 123 and miners go crazy hashing 000, 001, 002, etc until someone  hashes 123 and gets xyz. The miner gives 123 as the proof of work which results in xyz when hashed.  Is this "basically" correct?
If it is, couldnt we have a massive data base with the resulting hashes for 000, 001, 002, etc...?  And couldnt this database be used to reverse hash other information?

Got it, thanks

Someone asking for me?
@_date: 2013-12-02 07:32:51
So how would that work? (The farmers market) dont you need at least 10 minutes to confirm the transaction? Would you pay with your phone?

So why do you spend your btc now if presumably they will be worth more in the future?
