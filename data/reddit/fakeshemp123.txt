He claims to have a PhD in theology completed 1998-2003. He doesn't state the institution but it doesn't seem likely it's CSU.
He has been doing a PhD in computer science at CSU since 2009. His advisor's research page lists him as a current student.
So, it appears that he has one PhD and another in progress, not "multiple PhDs".
UPDATE: This article sheds some light on the PhD issue.

Because he doesn't want to admit that the only PhD he has actually been awarded was in theology. His deleted CV claims this was awarded in 2003, but he did not say where he got it, unlike all of his other qualifications.
He has been working on his computer science PhD at Charles Sturt University since 2009 but according to his advisor's research page he is still a current student, so that second PhD is still in progress.

I think the theology one is probably legit, but he's been very shady about it. He's used the title Dr for years, long before he started the PhD at CSU, and because he presents himself as an IT/computer science guy is banking on the fact that most people would just assume the PhD is in comp sci.

No, Martin Hale does not represent CSU. He's the CEO of IT Masters, which is the private company he founded. Craig was an employee of IT Masters.
CSU has confirmed that Craig was awarded the Master of Networking and Systems Administration, Master of Management (Information Technology) and Master of Information Systems Security and that he was an adjunct from May 2011 until May 2014, which is an honorary, unpaid position. These are genuine courses which are offered by CSU. Some of the subjects are developed and taught by CSU academics, some by IT Masters staff, but regardless they are required to meet the Australian standards for postgraduate study.

And at the end he doesn't even manage to get the address of his own company right - it's Delhi Rd, not Dehli.

No. Craig hasn't been an adjunct at CSU for some time.

IT Masters is a private company which is in partnership with CSU. This course is not being run by the university directly.

He's used the title Dr for a long time based solely on his PhD in theology. This is also the only qualification where he's steadfastly avoided revealing the institution. If he genuinely completed it at a regular university there is absolutely no reason not to say where it was from.

The paper is not very convincing. Peter Gutmann responded to this on his web page.
under Further Epilogue.
*"I wish they'd asked me before they put in all this effort because I could have told them before they started that this mixture almost certainly wouldn't work). Given that these are totally different techniques exploiting completely unrelated phenomena, it's not surprising that trying to use one to do the other didn't work."* (Peter Gutmann).
Table 1 stuck out as being weird right away. This is meant to be based on experimental data but the precision escalates to absurd levels. And I thought: *surely, they haven't just taken powers of the first entry?* But they did.
0.56^2 = 0.3136
0.56^4 = 0.098345
0.56^8 = 0.009672
0.56^1024 = 1.4E-258
and so on through the entire table. The 0.56 probability is an *experimental* result. It makes no sense to carry it on to the given precision. Moreover, the table *assumes* that measuring the value of different bits on the drive was independent, which is one of the things they needed to show experimentally. They then conclude *"Therefore, there is a chance of correctly choosing any bit in a selected byte (8-bits) – but this equates a probability around 0.9%"*. (I think they meant "every bit", not "any bit"). Even if their experiment was done correctly, this would only be true if the probability of getting each bit correct was independent. It doesn't appear that they considered that possibility, or tested it.
