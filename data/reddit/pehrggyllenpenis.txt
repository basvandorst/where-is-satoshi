Nothing wrong with the Bitcoin project, lots of time is wasted arguing. But this is also important in order to educate the community.
Things are going great, there have been no serious problems with the protocol and pseudonymous mining with proof of work seems to work far better than alternatives.
Cryptocurrency with a company behind them like Ripple, seems far less successful.

Do not ever listen to people who stand to gain from their own predictions, consider Cann, Buffet, Bill Gates or whoever the hell they are, as mere con-men trying to trick you.
This goes for anything financial, even these doomsday dudes are full of shit and have just been lucky X amount of times. Do not trust anyone but yourself. You cannot time the market.
Two bit idiot, what has that fool ever done but gossip and try to manipulate you all?
EDIT: I'm sorry I came off as too harsh, twobitidiot seems to have written a great deal and is active, I should value that, kudos for that. But my general advice still stands, do not blindly trust anyone giving you financial advice or predicting the market.

The taxes are very low on stocks etc in Sweden when structured in ISK or KF, compared to buying bitcoin as an investment and then selling it on an open exchange.
You will save around 20% in taxes if the value appreciates and you sell compared to holding your own wallet.

The original vision includes a built-in marketplace, not encouraging organizations to accept bitcoin and only have one implementation.
The current developer mindset is increase the block size after optimizations like SegWit (itself doubling the block size and solving quadratic hashing problem), LN implementations and sidechains.
The original vision according to the big blockers all of a sudden apparently includes FlexTrans, what makes them own the vision? What makes FlexTrans part of the original vision and SegWit such an abomination?

You are correct. Rather than paper (cloth or plastic) vs digital, the more important properties of money are: fungibility, traceability, centralization, inflation rate and transportation speed. Some of these properties interact with eachother.

Is it desperate to call it an invasion, or annexation? What would you call it?
Russian soldiers took over the parliament and installed pro-Russia government and announced an election a few days later. 
* looks like an invasion
* election was held when Crimea was under control by Russian military
* was declared illegitimate by everyone else
What would you suggest "the Western media" writes? What does Russia Today say when separatists from Chechnya attacks?
I understand that there is a large part of the demographic of Crimea, that are pro Russia. But it is not 98%+, if around 50% voted and the election process was very shady.
Is it really that desperate to call it an invasion? What if some part of Russia wanted independence (we've seen it happen many times in history), and some other idiot like Al-Qaida "liberates" them? Are you there cheering them on as well?
@_date: 2015-03-20 08:12:27
There are more basically straight out nazis in Russia (12% [LDRP]( than in Ukraine (2% Svoboda). Besides, Putins party are far-right authoritarian nationalists (please correct me if I'm wrong about them being nationalists) and they are more than 50%.
And stop obsessing over the EU, things can be quite weird on our level, but it's nothing compared to the complete utter fuckup that is Russia. Let the elected government in Ukraine decide weather they want Russian troops in their country, that's what the sensible thing is right now. How can anyone ridicule that? Supporting democracy?

One good reason is the notion that PoW algorithms should be easily implementable in hardware ([ASIC]( this will allow a broader range of hardware manufacturers to produce miners.
Because every proof of work securing a network valuable enough, will be implemented as ASIC.
If the PoW is simple, useful by itself (as your example with protein folding) and requires lots of more resources to solve than to verify, I'd say it's objectively better.
@_date: 2015-03-22 15:26:02
Obvious with that reasoning, I can't help to think that blockchains (not *the* Bitcoin blockchain), were around before Bitcoin combined it with currency units and proof of work.
Nothing is unhackable and Bitcoin has had it's flaws, malleability and atleast one pure bug. Open source projects are hacked regularly, so that's no guarantee, of course I would never trust a closed source cryptocurrency protocol implementation.
Attacker can also go after infrastructure, individual users and exchanges.
How are the IoT coins going to use the blockchain design? I've thought this was just a marketing ploy, but they seem kinda serious.

Why should people who use cash, debit cards and store owners subsidize credit card users?

It is easier for me to send you money from Europe with Bitcoin, than me sending you money with my credit card. I bet you're not even hooked up to accept Visa or Mastercard. Still it would take several days to clear the transaction.
And I don't really trust you with my CC-number to be honest.
@_date: 2015-03-20 17:37:21


Yes, and I said they make up 2% of rulers. BBC reporter writes that there are more nazi parties in Ukraine, but nothing like Russias 12% *in* *power*, not counting United Russia.


Article denies that Russian troops attacked Ukraine, I guess this was still before the official story broke:


Moving on..


Again, 12% of Russian regime are nazis. And I hate nazis, no matter where they live. We can at least agree on this I'm guessing.


Sorry, but this is journalism and not part of some elaborate scheme to discredit the great liberators. Like Vice is not a state conspiracy to spread drugs and decadence over the world, or perhaps it is.

Yes they are similar, but SMSsecure is of course based on TextSecure. The recommendation is still TextSecure because it is the best program in terms of audibility, security, governance and ease of use.

Well, in parts of EU it's forbidden by law for a store owner to charge extra for people who pay with CC.
So there is not much of an argument. The CC company and the customer using the credit card are subsidized by people who use cheaper processors.
In Sweden, CC payments make up 20% revenues, but 50% of the transaction costs. CCs are way more expensive than other digital money like debit cards, more than 5 times per transaction according to one survey.
I'm not saying bitcoin is ready to replace cash or cards, but the credit card industry is like the mafia in some sense.
The suggested fix from the EU sounds good, banks or CC-companies are not in competition with each other, it's an oligarchy.
I agree about the risks of cash based business, but I think most merchants are required to keep a digital ledger of all the transactions. So you can easily verify this digitally when the taxman comes and (with thieving employees) against the stock.

Curb Your Enthusiasm - Having Said That:

No, the two are not related in this case. Both are digital, but in this case Bitcoin can be understood as something like peer-to-peer cash.
@_date: 2015-03-11 19:56:25
Yes, this is very possible. According to the same study most merchants preferred digital payments over cash, except for the costs associated with it.
A high percentage of digital currency is also beneficial if central banks wants to use tools like negative interest. See Kenneth Rogoff for more information.
Overall it's beneficial to have less paper money if banks wants to create more credit, what used to be cash in our pockets are now the banks "downpayment" for the credit expansion.
