Mt Gox is usually in the business of making money off trades, they don't need to commit mass fraud and insider trading.
@_date: 2014-02-24 02:23:02
Heaps of errors in this article: 1. They calculate 'value' loss based on Mt Gox price peak. Only a fraction of the price drop since then has been caused from the current problems. Also Mt Gox price has never been an accurate figure due to their withdrawal issues. 2. They talk about a bitcoin bug which it is not, it's actually a 'feature' of bitcoin, one in which Mt Gox obviously didn't understand.  
  
And those two things were just In the first paragraph. Im nearly sure the journalist has a point but I didn't bother reading any more as he lost me with his inacurracies and typical journalistic hype.

Volume on bitcoinbuilder is nothing compared to gox. Plus you need a verified gox account to make any type of transfers. So unverified account means no bitcoinbuilder. And we all know it takes more then a month to get verified on gox.

I expected the worst due to the fact they got hacked in the first place, and how they stole customers money to fix that problem. Why should I take on the responsibility of the theft? Why should I gamble to see if they recover? If they don't repay the money they took from customers accounts, and BFX tokens isn't repayment, they then plain and simple have stolen peoples money.

Well another large segment of the community feels the risks aren't as dramatic and this issue goes to the core of what bitcoin is for them.
I honestly can't see an endgame for this myself. I'm nearly sure SegWit will die come November. A coin split is possible, but unlikely. I also can't see us with $5+ tx fees, not many will like this. So I'm forced now to reconsider all options.
How do you see this ending? Not necessarily what you wish for.

Love to see your stats on the justification for the economic majority against BU blocksize solution. I don't think there are any. That's why I presented the most objective stat, that of the miners.

Tell me this Drew: did any of the company shareholders dilute their shares in order to raise funds from other investors to save the company? I'm assuming not (happy to be corrected), instead they forced all their customers to take that responsibility of the outcome of the company. This way the owners don't dilute their shares. Can you see the non-consensual transfer of risk? I'm assuming greed and illegal activity lead to your companies "brilliant" solution.

I don't think your charts say that at all. What your charts show is what happens when you have a perfectly inelastic supply, i.e. transaction rate stuck at 7 tx/sec. Therefore price of tx fees will depend on the demand elasticity. Your chart shows that overall demand is increasing, or demand is getting less elastic, i.e. cosumers/bitcoin users are less willing to go else where and are stuck trying to outbid each other to get on the blockchain.


Your examples on what would happen on a blocksize increase seem to imply a price disequilibrium, which would result in excess demand, or if prices stayed high, excess supply.
Also your graphs fail to account for the block reward halving mid last year. This will have an impact on what tx fees miners will want.

I took everything I could transfer off the exchange. I didn't agree to the stealing of my money or the BFX tokens. So I was too hold onto my BFX tokens in order to wait for them to appreciate? As you can understand I had zero trust in this company that had poor security measures and was robbed because of it, then Bitfinex tried to fix it by robbing me and the majority of their customers, and then tried to transfer me their risk and responsibility. I expected its CEO to be arrested and the company to go into liquidation. So yeah, I didn't value those tokens very much. I'm expecting my money from them still, and until they take responsibility for their actions and return the money they stole from their customers, they are thieves in my book.
@_date: 2017-02-17 06:02:51
Miners are incentivized for larger blocks. Law of supply: as price increases the producers (miners) make available more transactions. Price then reaches equilibrium based on the consumer demand.
@_date: 2017-02-08 09:52:27


Well, BU current consensus threshold is 75% (currently at 21% which is similar to SegWit). Just like SegWit, its a while off before we determine the majority of hashing power. They won't fork until they get to there. Looks like there is a significant interest in this, and definitely worth while looking into.
@_date: 2017-02-08 05:28:51
Hi Adam, Okay, serious question, I'll give a serious answer. But first I will have to point out this is a [false dichotomy]( therefore more options are required. For example here are two additional options:
A. there is the option of a bitcoin with a larger block size without a contentious hard fork.
B. another option is bitcoin with a larger block size and the raft of SegWit updates.
These are serious options to consider and should not be ignored, as people with a lot of power really believe in the first option I mentioned and are making ground towards it happening. They believe it will work without a split. Their motivation comes from making bitcoin better, not wanting to destroy it as you imply.
Note that out of those two options I have made no comment on their likelihood of occurring. I would assume you might say that there is 0% chance of either of those two options occurring, but I think you're trying to over simplify the situation by eliminating feasible and distinguishable outcomes; or maybe just wishful thinking.
Having said that, I agree that your second outcome (coin slpit, ETF delay, price decline) is one of the unintended possibilities, but no one is aiming for that, and no one will of course pick that option.
Just a few of my serious opinions on your serious question.
@_date: 2017-02-05 05:46:00
We'll get to ATH and beyond by getting consensus on larger blocks, whether it be with SegWit or BU. Currently BU is gaining on consensus thus the latest spike. It just passed SegWit on blocks / last 1000 mined.
@_date: 2017-02-27 04:34:53
Its difficult to say what the options are, I would need to see your financial details. Provide a profit and loss statement, balance sheet, your business marketing plan, a budget to hire legal advice, your immediate/preliminary investigation into the hack, and I'll get back to you with some recommendations. But I will tell you what, your companies solution of stealing money from all your customers and then transferring the responsibility of the companies outcome to those same customers is very far from any solution I would come up with. Its ethically wrong and most likely illegal.
@_date: 2017-02-27 04:49:35
I wouldn't say frustrated as there is not much I can do about you stealing your customers assets. If I knew a lawyer in Hong Kong I would investigate legal action against your company. Maybe one day. My point here is to persuade u/teal_cat to keep your company off his list due to your exchange having been hacked and your behavior after the fact. I wouldn't want other people to be in the same situation.

They should stay off the list, best not to direct people there. They took my money out of my account and I don't think I will be getting that back. I withdraw everything I had on there as fast as I could. I don't think they will be paying me any time soon.
@_date: 2017-02-19 23:16:46
Cool graphs, very interesting. Well I still say as the blocksize increases this time we'll get a different effect, mainly because the block reward was higher back in 2013, and it is half of that now. So miners are more reliant on fees, thus market conditions will effect it more. Miners have control of transaction ordering, i.e. supply; combine this will the demand curve and we'll get our tx fee.
I would love to get my hands on more of that data, as it is interesting to work out how elastic demand is when we have another example of limited supply in tx.
@_date: 2017-02-17 05:58:54
Increase the block size and fees will go down, but amount of transactions goes up, therefore overall more income for miners. Simple law of supply and demand reaching equilibrium.
@_date: 2017-02-26 03:51:26
No, I expected the worst so I made sure I took what ever capital I could from your site, before more was taken. From the way you're communicating now your business still sounds like it has taken no responsibility for this hack at all. You steal peoples money, and only return it too a few, of course people aren't going to be pleased. Just have a read again of what you said Drew.

Nice work. Good use of graphic design to show the transaction makeup. I especially found the raw data mouseovers to be helpful.  For more detail I found the [The Royal Fork's Deconstructing Transactions]( helpful to read along with this one. It filled in more detail on what the lockingscript consists of. Another one from them is a graphical representation of the [decoded/encoded public address generation]( from the private key.

1. significantly faster transaction times then bank transfers
2. significantly less fees then current banking options, account fees, wire transfer fees, CC fees, merchant setup fees etc. With a max_blocksize increase can include a new industry of micro payments.
3. ability for the unbanked and underbanked to participate in local and global markets
4. censorship resistant due to the distributed and decentralised nature of bitcoin.
5. significantly more private then cash and CC
6. ability to transfer money to anyone in the world
7. ability for anyone to easily develop technology to support the payment system relative to cash and CC systems.
Have a look at this introductory video on bitcoin which gives you a good run down on what it is:

Basically the solutions range from refunding all who were hacked to raising funds through loans and/or company dilution. This option could've even been offered to your customers, similar to your BFX coin solution (but in a consensual way).
The trouble with BFX coins, at best, is it opens you up to being sued by those who sold their coins early on, which will leave you having to pay up to double the amount initially stolen from you. This is not even considering the possibility of criminal charges.

Bitcoin the network is the Internet of money, and bitcoin the token (money/store of value) is email. Why does Andreas see it this way? I think he see's the importance in what Bitcoin is doing/has done in decentralisation, Bitcoin not blockchain idea.

With open source a project can be forked at any time. In Bitcoins case stakeholders disagreed on how to scale it, so the software got forked.
There are many stakeholders in the Bitcoin space, the developers of the software and their open source project, are just one of many others. So I would say its fair to assume that Coinbase sees it's not a simple case of who ever controls the open source project gets to say what Bitcoin is or isn't. 
I'm using the terms B1X and B2X to avoid ambiguity as this actual thread discusses what is BTC. As you can see it could get quite confusing for a reader when the term BTC is used as the writer could mean B2X. Thus the use of these terms which are relatively unambiguous.
