That is very good advice. I've always been scared that I somehow didn't do something right and in the case that something happens that I can't restore it. Simply doing it a couple of times should give peace of mind.

I also upgraded my security in phases; with the endgame being a hardware wallet. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:39:04
Is that all? There is also the passphrase to confirm transactions right?
For example, if everything is destroyed in my home. PC, Ledger nano s, everything, I have nothing; except for this paper with 24 or 48 words on it; I can still get my BTC? Only via a new Ledger Nano S, or can I use my 24 or 48 words via another service (for example; Ledger doesn't exist anymore and I cant get a second device).

It functions better for a little while, until 8mb is full and you have to raise it again and mining becomes centralized.
Lightning network will fix Real Bitcoin's problems and makes Bitcoin Cash obsolete. Since Bitcoin Cash has lost the battle to become the real Bitcoin, a completely different altcoin will probably have a way better solution if Bitcoin were to fail.

Current use might be awful, but there is a lot of development and I'm putting my faith in the lightning network. I've used Bitcoin with low fees and fast transactions in 2013. It's amazing when it works. It is going to work again. If the current state is permanent, I would've been out.

My parents said: 'Well the news was negative today, all these professors. Listen to us for some time and sell. Go on a nice holiday.'
I already can go on a nice holiday anyway. I will only sell it if I absolutely need to financially, or if it is a life changing ammount. 
Best case scenario: you don't HAVE to sell, since Bitcoin is that much of a default thing that you can just use them in stead of selling them.

How much managing does the average user have to do  in comparison with how Bitcoin works now?

In Europe we barely use credit cards, so it's already an extra convenience. Bitcoin is also really important and useful if you have a really unstable government or a bad currency. The avarage american doesn't need bitcoin, nor is it useful (as for right now).

No it's not. It's the exact opposite as of lately. Maybe not the posts, but the comments for sure. Every thread people are whining about the circlejerk. There is no discussion on because of the huge meta-circlejerk. "This subreddit is terrible"  -- "Let me tell you why you are not allowed to be happy".
I agree this subreddit used to be a circlejerky subreddit, but honestly; what do you expect. We are Bitcoin enthusiasts. We want Bitcoin to succeed. We are biased.

I think multibit works best if you don't want to understand everything. It's a good thing, but not for me. I want to know whats happening there with such an experimental thing.
Also, you seem to know your stuff so if you don't mind I'll ask you another question. I just got Electrum and as security I wrote down the seed, password, etc. I am also able to 'save' the wallet and this renders a extentionless file. Is this a universal wallet.dat file? Or is this like multibit, an original file.

@_date: 2017-01-06 17:03:25
Good to know. Then I don't really mind. It shows a problem with Bitcoin which I didn't know about, though (casual Bitcoin enthusiast). But when I started reading into THAT I uncovered a political shitshow that was way to complex about segwit and stuff. 
Why I asked is because I could imagine that because the network can't keep up with transactions, that my transaction will forever be at the end since there will be too many people using a higher fee to ever get to me. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 12:34:55
Okay, so this is a noob question but I've been confused. Months ago this fork was all about activating segwit to allow for bigger block sizes; so that transactions will be near-instant (right?). But the last (few) weeks the fork was all about Bitcoin Cash, some alt coin that seeks to branch from the main Bitcoin Network. 
Is this fork both of the adjustments at the same time? Will the fork be 2 branches? 1 segwit and 2 BCC? 
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:17:35
Ah, that makes sense. In the end it doesn't matter for the user if the transaction is Lightning or on-chain. As long as you can buy a decentralized independent cup of coffee within seconds with virtually no extra costs, and at the same time transfer 100k$ to the other side of the planet without any hassle or significant cost. Only then Bitcoin will be mainstream succesful. 
@_date: 2017-01-05 20:48:59
This amazes me. especially as I didn't pay attention to my fees and now I have 2 transactions in limbo for probably the next day. 
How do miners just decide to pick up a new system? Doesn't everyone has to switch? 
Also; is there a ETA for this project?
@_date: 2017-01-06 15:29:57
don't jinx it
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:08:20
Because it's a one time only transaction cost. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:04:23
It's unusable for microtransactions in its current form. Transaction costs need to go to the 0.01-0.05$ per transaction. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 12:42:17
So no set date for the segwit 'fork'? And BCC folks seperating from us make segwit acceptation easier, right? 
@_date: 2017-08-01 12:53:12
Oo that makes sense. Thanks! 
@_date: 2017-08-01 12:27:34
@_date: 2017-08-01 12:41:36
ooo, I always thought that the segwit fork was planned for today.
So this fork makes it essentially easier to apply segwit. Since the segwit protesters are going with BCC? I'm probably oversimplifying but this is real tough material. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:15:06
Right now, yeah. I guess soon every wallet has segwit, so a standard transaction is segwit enabled. Now it's just the starting phase.

At this moment, without interest to invest, a normal person doesn't want bitcoin. It is the bitcoin community who are actively "starting up" bitcoin right now. As soon as bitcoin is more and more mainstream, more and more companies will accept bitcoin. A lot Technology will have bitcoin integrated in a smart and conveniënt way. This is where bitcoin will be interesting for the "normal folk". It will be an easy way to buy stuff.
With the increasing internationalisation, it is important to ease up the ways of international payments. Bitcoin is perfect for that.

I think you mean underestimated. Or you have a weird logic.

Wont this be a problem? Lost bitcoins? It is gonna happen, a lot.

I send a quote from someone on the IRC chat of to my friends.
He said: "I'm so happy I have nothing to do today so I can watch charts all day this is so much fun" 
I agreed with him, but it made me realize how weird that quote sounded for non-bitcoin fanatics.

Thanks!

I agree a physical bitcoin is useless, but this idea popped to me when I read about other people trying to make physical bitcoins.

First thing I might actually use here in the Netherlands!

This was really, really cringeworthy for a non-american.
I'm Dutch, and most mainstream newschannels aren't much better here, but their opinions are so strong it is annoying. They are not open to anything and bash it. They bash it with not enough information. And this even looks like a serious news channel!

But since there is a limited number, wouldn't the value go up. (In a imaginative scenario where BTC is stabalized, all coins are mined and BTC is the standard form of currency)
If Bitcoins keep getting lost in random wallets, there will be less and less BTC; causing an inflation which could be too much.
@_date: 2013-12-03 23:12:39
Not personally, but just for the sake of bitcoin; that would actually be pretty good.

"Oh man, bitcoin went back up? Now I really regret commiting suicide.."
@_date: 2013-12-17 10:27:58
But the bad thing is this wont recover as fast as it went down, right? 
@_date: 2013-12-04 22:49:12
I don't know shit about 3D printing or the true mechanism behind bitcoin. 
Who will start a company with me? :D

I want to buy my first BTC tonight or tomorrow. I think it will rise more. Ive never invested before, so would you think my timing is okay? Because the media attention, I think it will rise more.
