Best fake out ever or the most obvious crash ever? Lol

Only if you sell.

��Whatever the price, the safest buy is at noon tomorrow.

Trend was invalidated the day we broke 9100. Now we’ve broke the bottom trend line. I don’t even see a bull case anymore. Not this year anyway.

It’s just a stable coin now I guess. ��‍♂️
@_date: 2019-07-26 06:07:50
Lol I saw that. Looks like a huge account transfer? Buy on one until it hits a price then sell the same amount in the other?
@_date: 2019-07-13 21:51:31
Would you muppets just panic sell all your bitcoins already? Me and the other whales tired of waiting and you peasants aren’t invited to the moon trip. Okay bye.
@_date: 2019-07-09 00:59:36
Low prices mean more bitcoins for us. Sure wouldn’t mind a dip to $9k before takeoff.
@_date: 2019-07-27 11:38:06
That means they’re selling.
@_date: 2019-07-26 17:29:14
Maybe trump will sign an executive order tomorrow and the price will drop to zero. ��
And maybe his buddies already know.

Like just go up now it’s not that hard you do it all the time.
@_date: 2019-07-15 00:44:41
Have you all panic sold yet? Cause I’m not bringing the price back up until all the peasants are out.
Edit: Okay forget it you jerks, I’m cancelling the moon trip. Everybody go home.

BTFD, friend. 
China thanks you. Your donations keep billionaires fat through the trade war.
@_date: 2019-08-15 20:48:53
I think this is too early to be the real bounce. Keeping some aside for lower prices. (Up to $11k, maybe a brief spike to 11.4k, back down to $9.2k then the real fun next week.)
@_date: 2019-08-16 20:04:48
Haha same.
@_date: 2019-08-29 22:32:55
The number of upvotes to this post will determine the price of bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-29 13:20:57
You can BTFD like a good bitcoiner to pad your ego against the 10% you just lost buy it won’t help when its 90% two months from now. This Chinese pump and dump is over.
@_date: 2019-08-17 19:40:42
Buy the dip tonight. Last one.
@_date: 2019-08-13 17:05:17
Blasted thru the GS stop without a wink. No signs of stopping. It’s only gaining speed.
@_date: 2019-08-29 00:17:46
Crazy to think we’ll never see bitcoin over $10k again. Really thought it would test the high. Oh well, back to $1k we go.
@_date: 2019-08-31 19:01:21
Look out below.
@_date: 2019-08-14 01:37:21
Only bullish sentiment will be accepted here. $8k here we come.
@_date: 2019-08-29 04:01:32
You wouldn’t be this mad if you didn’t know that despite the fact you’ve been DCAing and HODLing like a good bitcoiner you’re still not gonna make your money back from last time. ��
@_date: 2019-08-29 02:26:49
May she RIP in P until zombie time come $1k.
@_date: 2019-08-28 18:19:38
The dip hasn’t even started. ��
@_date: 2019-08-29 04:40:20
Goodnight. $8k by the time we wake up.
@_date: 2019-08-17 21:39:37
They give me the charts ahead of time.
@_date: 2019-08-14 16:50:31
I agree, should bounce this weekend. May only make it to $9.2k by then but it’s falling hard for the next two days regardless.
@_date: 2019-08-16 19:58:46
Lol have fun.
@_date: 2019-08-21 12:36:59
Well, so much for bitcoin ever replacing gold. China selling their load. Here’s your death certificate. Look out below. ��

@_date: 2019-08-14 16:32:19
Helluva bounce there. Like a dead kitty. Meow meow meow all the way to $8k.
@_date: 2019-08-29 15:00:45
Minimizing a comment is easy. Having your view challenged isn’t. You wouldn’t be mad if they weren’t right.

You need a reality check. This shitcoin is dead.
@_date: 2019-08-13 16:35:38
Had to know when they posted that GS analysis they were gonna attack the shit outta that stop loss.
@_date: 2019-08-28 18:17:27
So that’s fucked.
@_date: 2019-08-29 04:26:48
Like gold which has real intrinsic value and is currently trading at infinity. Oh wait no it’s less than bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-29 04:29:53
Oh well it will be worthless soon anyway.

Every time you down vote a bitcoiner loses their money. Again.
@_date: 2019-08-29 00:51:08
Third wave is dead so no chance of five. It was trading just like gold until the big ramp came, then the smart money knew that was the time to exit. Its even broken Goldman Sachs stop loss. Big money is outta here.
@_date: 2019-08-20 16:44:16
Bitcoin thrives on bad sentiment. Just doing my part.
@_date: 2019-08-14 01:29:00

Giving up already. Back to the shitter for good. ��
@_date: 2019-08-21 12:58:46
Don’t worry only 4 more days before it hits bottom.
@_date: 2019-08-14 01:33:28
Interestingly, ETH which has been overreacting to BTC corrections and underperforming BTC in rallies is only down 1.4%
Translation: this crash hasn’t even started.
@_date: 2019-08-16 14:09:10
I’ll be buying the dip.
@_date: 2019-09-13 20:42:38
Haha now you are trying to troll me. Nice try! I’m waiting for it to make the next kitty cat ear cause then it will go all the way down the kitty’s back and then up again to make the kitty tail. I call this chart pattern “beware of kitty”.
@_date: 2019-09-24 00:14:50
����Looks like we’re in for a spooky October.
7k by Halloween?����
@_date: 2019-09-19 02:50:17
Another lower high. Think 9.5 will catch us again this time?
@_date: 2019-09-10 20:01:43
Just getting started. ��
@_date: 2019-09-26 18:59:40
Boing! ��
@_date: 2019-09-06 19:30:44
Let see if we can make it $900
@_date: 2019-09-04 05:41:28
Did you walk all the way over there? Cause it seems like you’re forgetting that massive dip between “now” and the top of Huayna Picchu.
@_date: 2019-09-13 21:17:06
Yes. But scritch lightly about the ears lest you get the claws.
@_date: 2019-09-13 17:53:15
When posting stupid shit stops making you cry.
@_date: 2019-09-06 19:10:23
Hope in one hand shit in the other. Your hand full of shit is now worth more than your bitcoin lol
@_date: 2019-09-22 16:48:14
Better go back down and check that 9.8k is really gonna hold us.
@_date: 2019-09-24 16:18:13

Lookin pretty antsy.
@_date: 2019-09-24 16:49:35
Hahaha good one, you’re always trolling me EB, I love it. Sorry, for warning you at the highs, Should I wait until we’re at 7k to warn you about 7k? ��
@_date: 2019-09-16 14:47:08
He’s right, keep in mind who bitcoin is up against and what lengths they’ll go to to win. Also keep in mind who controls about half the mining rigs in the world right now.
@_date: 2019-09-25 02:51:36
This dead kitty needs a fake out pump.
@_date: 2019-09-24 17:07:29
That’s funny you seemed pretty salty when I suggested it last week. What will the excuse be at 7k?
@_date: 2019-09-11 16:02:36
Yeah, gonna bounce like hell off $8k on the way down to $5k.
@_date: 2019-09-23 16:25:03
That Faberge like the egg. Crazy to think that spike down and back up this morning was just a bump in the road. We must be in for some fun. I may be proven right sooner than I thought.
@_date: 2019-09-11 14:12:36
See you at $5k
@_date: 2019-09-23 12:22:09
$9.4  here we come. Or should I say $7.5k ?
@_date: 2019-09-23 12:54:31
Wait to buy below $5k. Thanks to bakkt whales can finally unload huge amounts while also shorting to make up for the self induced price drop. It’s the perfect storm of manipulation China will used to finally kill the currency which they’ve taken control of and which threatens their state currency.
@_date: 2019-09-13 20:59:24
Jun 19 - Jul 19 is a kitty.
@_date: 2019-09-06 20:25:05
Getting cheaper by the minute!
@_date: 2019-09-24 16:33:53
So you’re mad I started warning you at the highs? 
Enjoy your dead kitty bounce.
7k by Halloween. 
See you there.

No pessimism alowed here, mister! It messes with the groupthink.
@_date: 2019-09-24 16:02:38
9.4 is still 9.4, as promised. See you at 7.
@_date: 2019-09-16 15:20:29
Just keeps failing at lower highs. How long for us to think of it as a new high.
@_date: 2019-09-21 17:16:04
Idk for sure obviously, just pointing out the elephant who has been shitting on the carpet. Every bull flag for the past 3 months has failed right when it looked like it would break out. ETH is following this exactly and a bit ahead of BTC. Usually BTC falls, ETH follows to a lesser degree while BTC pauses, then both fall sharply together.  I wouldn’t call this the first wave, but an extended third. High risk. But we shall see.
@_date: 2019-09-16 16:49:45
Plus April-December. We’re talking 2018, right?
@_date: 2019-09-24 15:43:49
If only someone had warned us! LOL
I’ll wait for $7k to BTD. 
Happy Halloween spooksters. ����

@_date: 2019-09-21 20:50:24
Have been watching bitcoin and have come ups with this handy guide to price action and reaction:
If it makes a bull flag: it’s gonna drop $400.
If it shoots up $200: it’s gonna chill for a day then drop $400.
If it drops $400: it’s gonna rally $400, chill, then drop $400. 
If it gaps up: it’s gonna reverse and drop $400.
If it gaps down: it’s gonna continue dropping $400. 
If it gets more than $200 above 10k: well you get the idea.
@_date: 2019-09-23 13:58:53
Ask me again when half the nodes return 0.
@_date: 2019-09-24 15:27:18
@_date: 2019-09-11 15:38:59
And good luck with ummmm, holding any value. See you at $5k. Weeeeeee
@_date: 2019-09-23 13:36:55
I’ll just wait to be proven right. Shouldn’t take long.
@_date: 2019-09-24 17:35:28
Every time someone makes a bearish prediction you guys swarm like the thought police and then every time one come true it’s “yeah but I’m still up”. We get it man, good for you, ignore the prediction and stop crying then. This warning isn’t for you.
@_date: 2019-09-06 18:52:40
Here we go again. Weeeeee
@_date: 2019-09-21 21:50:41
@_date: 2019-09-11 16:21:38
Because it’s under now for good?
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:04:04
How many points am I up to now?
@_date: 2019-09-11 14:42:54
Yes they give me the chart ahead of time.
@_date: 2019-09-04 14:52:51
You’re not just gonna let them sell it below 10420.69 are you? Are you!?
@_date: 2019-09-06 20:44:34
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, I will now attempt to single handedly sell bitcoin back below $10k. Watch closely. But please, no flash photography.
@_date: 2019-09-23 14:36:05
Haven’t been wrong once yet. Just lower high and lower lows.
@_date: 2019-09-10 19:46:41

You’re sounding pretty salty for someone who doesn’t give a fuck.
@_date: 2019-09-21 22:12:41
Where will we be one BTC catches up with ETH? 9.2k? And DOGE hasn’t even started dropping yet. BTC will be last to bounce. May see $8k sooner than expected. Then my patented kitty cat chart pattern will be confirmed.
@_date: 2019-09-13 17:29:33
Another failure at a lower high. When will the bulls give up?
@_date: 2019-09-13 18:10:01
Haha most people wouldn’t waste their time. See you at $5k.
@_date: 2019-09-21 13:07:49
ETH doing all the work for BTC this week. And now even ETH is slipping. Gonna be a big one  ��
