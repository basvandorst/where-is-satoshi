Money doesn't create happiness. But it can create comfort. Mostly money takes away sources of sadness, in my experience.
Also, I'm not sure what your argument is meant to be. In one post you wrote


Then you wrote:


So you think being poor causes hell; but you also think being poor doesn't inhibit your ability to find happiness?

hello, no I'm not Greek, but I think Greek history/culture is quite interesting to read about. :-)
Since we are on - did you know that the earliest known financial scam in world history was a Greek person in 300BC, by the name of Hegestratos?

He... used Google...

Glad you enjoyed it. The emotional rollercoaster of life lasts 1 year for some people and 2 minutes for others.

Imagine the feeling of having 4 kids of your own who look up to you. You live a tough life together, barely making ends meet, but you all have one another to help you, to talk to, and to build good memories with.
Now imagine the feeling of seeing a cryptocurrency investment half in the last week, and drop 80%+ in less than a year, while memeing yourself into a haze of apathy on an internet forum.
"Life could get way more depressing lmfao", the lady in the ghetto told her children.

You remember the guy in the story who was deformed and sold out to Xerxes, showing him a mountain path to circle behind the Spartan forces?
His name is the word for 'nightmare' even today, in Greek

I spent a lot of my life extremely poor, so poor that my parents couldn't afford to buy food in the shops sometimes. Just low wages + high inflation (not a smoking, drinking or gambling family). Hardly ever &gt; $100 in the bank for many years. But the family spirit was great, our friends (also poor) were great. Poor people go out of their way to be good to each other. You learn to make your own fun. You know you have to stick together. I miss those days sometimes.

Ok, done!  It was a bank transfer to my parents on the other side of the country. It took under 1 minute including setting up the transaction and moving the money completely, it was totally free,  not even a charge to maintain the bank accounts we have.  I just entered my pin, selected payment, chose my parents name and entered the amount and hit confirm.
&lt;1 minute later they have the money and can spend it on millions of different places. 
Unlike bitcoin,  in the minute it was transferring,  the value **didn't** drop 5-10% for no reason at all.

I made a payment with cash today.  
- To avoid opening my wallet I took the cash from the back pocket of my trousers 
- I handed the cash to another guy. 
- He said thank you 
- Theoretical worldwide capacity of 7 billion transactions per second currently 
- HODLing cash
