Fungibility means all coins are identical. 
In Bitcoin this isnt true because some coins might be recently minted with no history, while others might have been involved in illegal activities and thus less desirable because law enforcement might track it.
With Monero (for example) there is no history...so they are fungible.

You talk a lot about Censorship resistance etc. What do you think of the next-gen of coins that dont have such an easy to see public ledger - like Monero?

Oh, I didn't see that. And yeah, I would definitely scan the file before going near that. Or better yet not even download it at all
@_date: 2016-10-01 08:09:12
Interesting. When do you think it will start?
@_date: 2016-10-07 08:01:46
Yeah, you're right. Scratch this post.

Sorry guys... my account was hacked. I hope no one did anything drastic.
At any rate, its back under my control now. Apologies for any problems caused.

You'd think they would tell us when we sign up. &gt;.&gt;
@_date: 2016-07-14 23:45:51
In your opinion, what happens after that tho? After the halving turbulence is done - say in Jan 2017?

Pardon my noobishness. What does 20x long mean?
@_date: 2016-07-12 21:03:47
Yeah, its something to think about.
@_date: 2016-07-14 13:44:05
Sarcasm aside, dont see it anywhere...
@_date: 2016-07-10 02:35:26
You are trying to half the current supply, not the future supply...

This would make sense for Oil Drillers (to keep the wells open), but why miners?

Im trying such strategies right now. It does lead to faster order fulfillment. Thx.
@_date: 2016-07-27 01:23:33
Gotcha, thx!

Are these as liquid as holding raw coins though? If the price spikes, will I be able to sell?
@_date: 2016-07-12 05:09:39
Way I see it, fiat has a lot of value due to acceptance. 
Ill take an analogy. I think the American Stock markets are overvalued. But I may still invest in them versus markets that I think are a better deal. Why? Because the banks loan me money to trade on margin for american stocks a lot more/easier.
Same way, Bitcoin is rather illiquid... (I cant buy stocks with it for example - which is another way for me to build capital). Also, there are other non-fiat alternatives - like gold, which function a bit like bitcoin anyway.

Huge loss. I got 30K I could put in my TFSA, but I got to pay these guys up to 25% tax instead.

No, hes clearly a bot. I saw him changing for other buy orders as well.
@_date: 2016-07-27 00:05:56
I prefer reddit. :D

Sound enough. But the part about some elephants sitting it out before they all jump in... aka a small/moderate dip before a strong surge - is that generally part of the pattern too?

Dont the trading prices seem $2-5 cheaper on Taurus?

w00t? No Steam Profile?
@_date: 2016-07-12 03:04:27
True, but that may be a long time, and perhaps, if ever.
How do you weigh the decision to hold or sell over time?

Canadian Taxes and Bitcoin?
A general overview? I read that its capital gains, but if so, I cant stick 'em in a TFSA? WTF?
@_date: 2016-07-12 05:42:52
Fiat &gt; bitcoin for some? 
Precisely? Heck if I know.

Biggest reserves of oil in the world, and a failed socialist shit-hole.

@_date: 2016-07-12 14:39:17
Thanks for the clear explanation.
In my worldview though, there are competing non-fiat currencies, like gold, so Im just trying to get different perspectives.
@_date: 2016-07-26 09:31:50
Thanks for the general answer, but if you could, what is 20x long specifically?
