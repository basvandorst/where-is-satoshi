as recent as February this year... you know that $0 tx cost used to be a THING right?

the people that think mainstream education is good can cringe all they want but even they know most professors ARE anti-bitcoin.

I cant even begin to comprehend how dense someone has to be to make a remark like that. First of all, I invested early because i BELIEVED in the technology. So yes, I am interested in bitcoins flaws. Secondly, I might not be affected, but the purpose of bitcoin was NOT for wealthy individuals. It was meant to be a currency that the average joe could use.  More than anything, I am helping people like you by voicing out. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:14:09
but... the original post was about using bitcoin as a currency. When did it become about coinbase? This sub PREACHES about using your own wallet and 'FUCK THE EXCHANGES'. Now you're complaining that they dont subsidise the tx cost? are we supposed to be using coinbase as a wallet now? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:49:37
withdrawing =/= transaction costs buddy. Besides, if he used his own wallet which is what this sub preaches, he would have to pay the tx fees himself regardless.

google 'lightning network 2015' and browse the forums/articles.
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:47:01
LOL. you gotta learn to walk before you run. No one said anything about beating paypal. The person you're replying to was talking about a temporary solution while waiting for LN to roll out. which, by the way, has been in 'development' for multiple years now. 
P.S. I dont own a single bitcoin cash. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:42:04
right. 'when' is the question.
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:51:53
 there was a post stickied by the mods about bitcoin having cheaper tx fees than visa and paypal. I'll let you form your opinions as to why they removed it.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:27:58
right, they COULD have chosen to subsidise the fees for their customers but thats not the point is it? the point is FEES are high. Not whether coinbase should subsidise your tx fees or not.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:32:32
Funny, if you told someone you paid $3 in BTC transaction fees a year ago, they would've been appalled, now its apparently a good thing. Anyway, no retail shop is going to have the luxury to wait for multiple hours with such a low tx fee. hell, my $50 tx fee transaction took 18 hours to confirm. lastly, 'wait awhile' is a huge understatement.
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:38:55
except the MSM don't want him because well, its the msm.
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:53:50
it is. coinbase isn't the one forcing you to set such high fees. Try it with your own wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:37:54
as another long time holder who has recently started complaining... we have been waiting for YEARS for LN now. 
@_date: 2017-02-02 08:07:29
Legitimate question. The 51% attack seems like a very realistic threat, yet no one is talking about it. If bitcoin really becomes so valuable, isn't it not too far fetched to think a large tech firm or even a whole nation to want to control the supply n shitz?
@_date: 2017-03-13 14:08:35
Can someone explain if there will be a split to two coins?
@_date: 2017-03-12 18:09:01
He does actually. LOL
@_date: 2017-02-09 14:18:09
welp, turns out you were right! only for a month though, but yea
@_date: 2017-03-08 12:28:51
even funnier because its a bear. LOL
@_date: 2017-08-21 13:29:41
pretty sure segwit2x is 4mb. bcash is 8mb
@_date: 2017-08-08 06:41:55
Does ANYONE actually watch the video? He was very objective about it and stated the advantages of bitcoin. He never said the words  'bitcoin is unstoppable'
@_date: 2017-08-25 17:19:09
In a free economy, people would do most of the things just like any other occupation. Some stuff like firefighters and maintainence of infrastructure can be paid using bonds issued by the government. You pay fines to the police, you pay when you visit a hospital, you pay school fees and you ALREADY pay road tax. Most things the government builds (they actually pay private companies) using our tax money you already paid for through other means. Oh and most often quoted by people bashing tax-dodgers is 'but electricity and water!!'. Yeah, you pay for that in your monthly utility bill too...

Please elaborate what would be the problem with people knowing 3 addresses belonged to the same person?
@_date: 2017-08-06 07:04:14
exactly, you're 100% right. I support BTC but the way they're slowly trying to change the narrative to go back on their word on segwit2x is ridiculous, segwit could only be activated because people wanted BOTH!
@_date: 2017-08-26 09:20:39
why didnt you post his address?
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:00:24
Just like any other lecturer who states that their opinion as absolute truth... 'obviously' 'clearly' 'should' 'must'. My lecturer said the Governments would make it obsolete LOL.
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:16:00
dollar cost averaging is another unsound advice

Not exactly Christian, but believe in God. I'm surprised you haven't got bashed for not conforming to the atheist sub culture of reddit yet. inb4

Let's be completely honest and unbiased. We simply do NOT know if the miners are in it for the money and neither do we know if AXA controls core's direction. However, we can be 100% certain that SOMETHING needs to be done about the fees. We can argue about which way is better without bringing in conspiracy theories on BOTH sides. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:40:28
Q2: Make your own decision. At the end of the day, you can look up articles to support/discourage any of your decisions. Other people's opinions are meaningless, only yours matters. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 17:38:47
and you guys call BCH supporters conspiracy theorists when they point out blockstream is owned by AXA... what. And i dont even own BCH.
@_date: 2017-04-08 06:32:42
we're all on the same team against fiat!

Gold is scarce, has a fixed/predictable supply. Doesn't corrode. Historically has been viewed as valuable by people all over the world (for any of many reasons like jewellery, crafting). Can be forged into specific units of weights easily, thus allowing for easy trade (fungibility). 
And no, Gold doesn't fluctuate that much over time. To be specific, 'that much' in relation to what? The USD has decreased in value a lot over time. Other fiats have fluctuated even more.
Also, your original comment was talking about fiat being BACKED by gold, now you're talking about gold AS currency, which is totally different. 
Please stop talking to avoid further embarassment
