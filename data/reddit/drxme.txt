Indeed very nice time to buy. I wish I have fiat to buy the dip.

Block Tab is future of Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:33:58
Did you try to delete Coinbase and sell Bitcoin Cash? It helps.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:27:36
People just selling BTC for alts, BTC going to recover soon if problem with tx fees will be fixed.
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:25:01
Did your wallet say that you have no money? Every transaction put change in new address.
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:44:54
*Bitcoin Cash
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:39:27
Do you guys have B plan?
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:57:59
The real question: how you are going to move all your coins with current fees and mempool situation?
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:32:55
Cool, don’t forget to use 300kb blocks.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:31:34
bruh, it’s just around the corner
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:28:06
How we are goin to lawsuit 1mb blocks?
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:48:36
hmm, is 21 club means what you have 21 bitcoin or you hold 1 bitcoin so you part of 21 million richest people club?
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:31:07
I’m still in shock that 1mb Bitcoin kill himself.
@_date: 2017-12-16 11:21:14
Bitcoin has hight fees because block size is about ~1Mb and that not enough capacity for current transaction volume.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:22:36
It’s a slow process, just wait 6-12 months. Major exchanges didn’t switched to Segwit as well (Who really voted for Segwit if only minority using it).
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:35:06
This is definitely Bitcoin Cash fault!
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:24:21
How much did you pay for it?
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:57:29
I also noticed it, I can't understand why you surprised, this subreddit is extremely manipulated and regulated.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:36:34
Shitpost 
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:49:38
Merchants drop BTC support because of high fees
and many people can’t afford $10-$20 tx fees. BTC is a store of value, you can’t buy a lot with it.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:15:27
You don’t know what you are talking about.
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:13:01
Bruh plz it will kill Bitcoin. Don’t create coin what actually better then core.
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:56:32
No one has asic chips at home, so yea, it’s centralized and regulated.
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:51:04
Next Monday 50k for sure
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:37:37
5k / 20k = 0.25 BTC
0.25 BTC * 23k = 5.75k = 5750, so you’ll have 750 profit
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:32:15
Why do you so salty? There is no bcash and you know it. There are many forks like Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Platinum, Bitcoin Something.
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:41:00
Maybe just accept the fact that there are hundreds of different crypto currencies.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:13:03
It is already forked - Bitcoin Cash, why do you want Bitcoin Cash 2?
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:54:39
Cool story.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:50:49
To make more profit from tx fees, very clever.
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:07:19
What if we don’t have time and need to transfer small amount between exchanges now.
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:43:13
You mean Bitcoin Cash right? As far as I know there in no BCash yet.
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:48:01
With such small amount I would invest to ETH or Bitcoin Cash because of fees.
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:45:13
Start investing in Tabs.
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:53:00
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:00:26
What is Bcash?
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:33:26
Just try this ICO, looks very promising 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:32:07
What if 1mb block is coordinated attack to prevent people use BTC at all?
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:38:27
Good thing about crypto - codebase and protocols
can be changed. If something doesn’t work, there are somewhere people who can fix it.
@_date: 2017-08-26 15:14:40
Or you can just use original Bitcoin and forget about BCore.
@_date: 2017-11-17 23:37:49
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:18:11
It doesn't matter, there are still 1B transactions and requires space to store information about them even if you move everything from chain. By the way, if your are using off-chain payments it's the same as using alt.
@_date: 2017-11-23 16:57:28
Why not boycott developers because they don’t want to fix issues with blocks and transaction confirmation time
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:36:30
The same as s1x scam
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:40:57
Nice nick tho
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:15:14
It’s not possible, bitcoin handle only 3 transactions per second.
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:30:18
!RedditSilver moresourdough
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:41:32
Hmm, did you try to blame bch? According to the reddit it helps
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:32:54
Don’t use Bitcoin for small transactions.
@_date: 2017-11-19 15:16:40
Not really, but you can generate as much public addresses as you want and wait till something interesting popup.
@_date: 2017-11-12 12:58:57
How you are going to dump with current mempool size
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:15:27
So you are all in in Bcore, even after Segwit experiment fail?
@_date: 2017-11-19 21:26:25
Um, okay, it’s not 0.02 tho
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:40:22
Dood, hey are ban you, hehehhe hehe
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:45:21
It’s already fixed - Bitcoin Cash
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:34:42
Yeah, just right around the corner.
@_date: 2017-11-23 16:58:35
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:20:05
[whoa dood]( 
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:46:31
I believe in BCH, BTC and other alts. Just think that Segwit is not helping to fix Bitcoin problems at least with the current implementation.
@_date: 2017-11-28 09:20:33
@_date: 2017-11-13 10:01:02
... and solution.
@_date: 2017-11-19 10:22:42
That’s actually bad for Bitcoin, it means that people who use BTC for microtransactions start using alts. The less people use BTC the faster and cheaper tx we have.
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:10:25
This post is typical example of witch-hunt
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:50:27
But Luke said that it doesn’t influence tx fees in a long run.
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:33:51
Literally epic win, what a time to be alive, hooray for you my friend.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:45:54
10000k = 10 000 000 
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:43:48
It’s just weak propaganda.
@_date: 2017-11-19 21:23:51
You don’t need powerful computer to create blocks, so in future will be people and companies who will do it for free. Current block difficulty is huge because there are many companies mine and profit from it. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:37:50
Bitcoin Segwit != Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:13:08
Segwit is altcoin as well
@_date: 2017-11-04 22:41:42
Because it going to replace Bitcoin, not to fix it.
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:42:14
everyone knows about it, meh
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:18:22
RemindMe! 365 days "check weak hands dood possible loses"
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:01:12
100 MB block = 104857600 Bytes = 838860800 bits
838860800 bits / 1B = 0.8388608 bits
You can't store transaction information in one bit, you need ~1816 bits
1816 bits * 1B = 1816000000000 bits = 216484 MB
so you need 211 GB to handle 1B transactions
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:12:02
I hold Bitcoin Segwit and Bitcoin Cash, for money transfer BTH and ETH.
@_date: 2017-11-19 15:25:02
Same here, I don't use segwit addresses.
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:04:53
So you are telling me that block reward 12.5BTC * $7k = $87500 is not enough for miner? Original Bitcoin used to work without tx fees at all, it should be just a tip.
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:21:02
Don’t forget to buy a tents because of confirmation time or you can just use bitcoin cash.
@_date: 2017-09-01 07:19:28
Wow, that’s extremely slow. How we are going to buy morning coffee with it?
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:21:42
According to your logic B2X is also Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:38:13
Thats only my point of view, but Segwit is not classic Bitcoin, even if it is solution for some problems
@_date: 2017-10-29 14:46:26
B1X fork is more popular and it gives huge advantage and success, I believe it survives anything, maybe one day we even remove all unnecessary segwit support.
