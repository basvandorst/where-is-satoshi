Radio 4 had a 3 minute section on the Today programme on Monday (it was about 8.45am if you haven't already heard it), it mentioned Bitcoin in fairly disparaging terms. Here's a [New Statesman article]( about the section that might make interesting reading. I'd be wary about the interviewer trying to belittle bitcoin, or make out that it's any sort of get-rich-quick scheme. Good luck and let us know when it's going to be on.

Have a look at the listed transactions, a lot of them look like 1BAD...GuYZ, e.g. [this one]( That's a vanity address, basically, you can apparently generate them using [this tool]( 
Not sure how they got a vanity start *and* end to an address though, vanitygen just does starts. Maybe that's what 69kBTC buys you?

Here's a submission on the [UK Bitcoin Subreddit](
[Getting bitcoins in UK cheap - Guide]( 
I'm waiting for the final stage to complete, i.e. transferring the money into BitStamp, and other people seem to have had success with it. Good luck!
