I think the title is misleading... if you read the entire news content, you'll realize MasterCard is actually trying to get bitcoin mainstream. The only way to do that is to have it regulated for mass adoption. "MasterCard suggests the government should create regulation that addresses the risks associated with cryptocurrency while still enabling lawful digital currency businesses to "flourish"." So.. is MasterCard a friend or foe of digital currency?

Ah... the irony of dealing in a trustless network. Sometimes the only option is to give full trust to complete strangers.

Here's a blog on what bitcoin exchange insiders know about the hack &amp; security measures that Bitstamp had in place when it happened.

It goes without saying that the responsibility falls on ourselves to do the research when choosing an exchange platform to do business with. Just because it is an established exchange, we cannot and should not assume that it has the highest security in place. On the positive side, there are exchanges proactively working to give customers greater transparency and accountability. You can read more about it here:

Why not compare it to all fiat currencies? How much would that be then?

You are correct.. the future value of the world's wealth will not be the same as the 2013 figure of $241 trillion. I was just trying to point out that if 1 satoshi is roughly US$1, the market cap of all 21 million bitcoins can represent the value of world's total wealth based on the latest report available.

As we are a registered company in Hong Kong, we have to be compliant with Hong Kong Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (and amendments), a very strict customer data privacy &amp; confidentiality law.
Also, we are following the PCI DSS compliance requirements and are planning to schedule PCI DSS audits.
Practically speaking, all the client identification data are systematically encrypted in our database.

We follow strict AML/KYC standards and transaction monitoring procedures on par with those used by renowned financial institutions. We also hold an MSO license issued by the HK Customs and Excise Dept.

According to the article's author: "The map is based on anecdotal evidence, not statistical data or official policy."
It's a work in progress and they're looking for help in creating it:

I see it more like price volatility sitting on one side and BTC adoption on the other side of a seesaw. The lower the volatility, the higher the adoption and vice versa. Would you agree that if volatility is low, BTC can be valued sky-high or dirt-cheap and still be used for day-to-day purposes like how we use smtp to transfer the e-mail messages? 
@_date: 2015-03-20 06:31:22
Yes, perhaps you are right. It's more about stability of value. Which still begs the question, what value is most sustainable for BTC's mass adoption?

But, but... I worked hard to create that meme for Gatecoin :~( Sorry you feel this way... I never meant to disguise it as anything other than what it is... My dream in a meme (hey, that rhymes! Maybe I'll do a poem for Gatecoin.com next time).
