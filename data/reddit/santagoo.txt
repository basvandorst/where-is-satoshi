Expensive because it doesn't scale relative to the value of the Bitcoin being transferred, but relative to the size of the transaction message in bytes.
If OP had transferred $10 worth of Bitcoin at the same time, from the same wallet, it would've costed him the same fee. So it'll be closer to 20%.

Depends on how much you're funding it with. For 0.1 BTC+, I'll have cold storage private keys locking it, tyvm.
For a wallet with few mBTC for micro-transacting around the web, I'm fine with a hot wallet managing it to reduce friction in favor of convenience.

Segwit is the equivalent of giving you 150% bigger block size. The scaling problem is exponential. You can't solve it linearly.
@_date: 2018-01-13 19:15:05
You would've paid more otherwise. Segwit doesn't magically make the fees disappear. It gives you a fee discount because your transaction size (in bytes) would've been bigger had you used a legacy address.
So, you get a fee discount, but you're still at the mercy of the current fee economy.

You mean technical sub. Trading sub and fan sub is almost identical. Lots of shills and fear manipulations either way.
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:38:11
That's only true from the lens of a node with old, pre-SegWit software. Since the witness data is segregated, old nodes see the transaction as taking up smaller space.
Nodes with current software, however, see the witness data and for them the total blocksize is higher.

The "solution" is for recipient to wait for X number of confirmation, each mined block on top of the first block that confirms your transaction renders the effort needed to double spend prohibitively higher.
That's why Coinbase, for example, won't show your transaction as officially confirmed until there are 6 confirmations total (current block height is 5 higher than the block that included said transaction).
The robber probably left after the transaction was broadcasted but before it was confirmed.

Even the Catholic Church formally assigns an *advocatus diaboli* (the origin of the term, "the Devil's advocate") when considering someone for sainthood. They appoint someone outside the church to be as sleuth as possible in digging up the person's past. Any negative aspects of the person are brought forward so the Church can reasonably believe they have the full facts before finally bestowing sainthood on that person after death.
It's not always concern trolling when you try to discuss short comings of something you believe in. Even the Catholic bloody Church does it as a formal process.

i think the point is since the rest of the world works in metric, they're used to switching between meters and centimeter and millimeters as the scale of what they are measuring goes up and down in orders of magnitude. So milli-, centi-, etc goes into everyday uses a lot more.
By contrast, in America, when you talk about driving distances you talk in miles, and when you talk about dress measurements you go into feet and inches. So going up and down in scales by utilizing prefixes and moving decimal points around in your head is not prevalent and is still reserved to trade professionals (e.g., like you said, Watts for electricians).
That's why the commenter before me thinks that the "Average Joe" would be confused about using milli and micro and other prefixes. My point is that outside America, the non-American "Average Joe" is already used to it in their daily lives.

The amount is expressed in integer though, as is should be in everything involving currency because you don't want to deal with floating point rounding errors.
So, a 5BTC is internally represented in the protocol (in the blockchain data) as 500000000 integer number.
So once transactions are happening in the satoshis, I don't see how we can subdivide it further without requiring a protocol change.

When the fees were in the 30$-50$ range, it was true for most transactions confirming with the next few blocks, **for any nominal BTC value transaction**. Meaning, when the network was congested, a 100 BTC transaction or a 0.01 BTC transaction would both have the same average fee. Fees are calculated per byte, not per BTC transacted.
So yes, when the fee was high, say, $30, it would have costed me $30 to transact a BTC equivalent of $1, as well.

For now. It wouldn't scale to the point of the whole world transacting in it, if that is the real vision of Bitcoin, any version of it.

Closing and opening LN nodes still require on chain transaction. The fees for those can still be kept high to incentivice miners, but the cost is amortized over the L2 transactions happening on the LN node.

You do own them. It's called change addresses. When you redeem the value of a Bitcoin balance in an address, you have to spend it all.
The way that is down when you only want to spend a portion is by having the transaction have two outputs: the recipient, and another address you control.
Address reuse is bad, so most wallet software will generate a new address called change address. Your electrum wallet should control the private keys associated with that change address, but probably not showing it to you by default.

The way I see it, you open a large channel (say, 1 BTC) in order to perform microtransactions scalably, with the fee amortized to hundreds of sub mBTC transactions so the high network fees can scale down.

Let's take a look at another example: volume.
A cube with 100 cm sides would have a volume of 1 million cubic cm. Too many zeroes to visualize? That's exactly 1 cubic meter.

The base is gram.
kilogram &gt; gram &gt; milligram.
When Newton became a derived unit, a kilogram was chosen for convention. Maybe it was because common objects have masses that can be described in whole kilograms, and thousands of grams.
But the decimal relationships still follow logically. A unit of force from an accelerating object with a mass of 1 gram, all else being equal, would be 1e-1000 Newton, not some weird fractions like 0.00278.
Now let's compare how this works in Imperial.
Let's use the Imperial tonne for mass. Yard for length, and second for time.
This unconventional "Imperial Newton" would be in Tn.yd/s^2.
Now if we want to "downsize" it for an object with mass 1 lb, not 1 tonne, you'll have to divide by **2,240** (1 tn = 2,240 lbs).
Compared to the SI Newton, if you want to downsize it for an object with mass 1 gram, you'll just have to drop 3 decimal places. An object with mass 1 SI ton? Add 3 zeroes.
It's the decimal progression.
With numbers, to drive it home:
A **1 Tonne** object accelerating at 1 yard per second per second would have a force of this unconventional 1 Imperial Newton, or **1 Tn.yd/s^2**.
A **1 lb.** object accelerating the same way would have a force of this unconventional **0.000446428...** Imperial Newton.
By comparison,
A **1 kg** object accelerating at 1 meter per second per second would have the force of the Standard Newton, or **1 kg.m/s^2**.
A **1 g** object, accelerating the same way would have a force **0.001** Newton.
A **1 mg** object? **0.000001** Newton.
A **1 (metric) ton** object? **1000** Newton.
The decimal progression *follows*, even if you think the Newton was weird for being derived by 1 kg as the base. You can always drop the units of its derivation parts into their smaller counterparts, which are always in progressions of 10's, not 3's, or 12's, or 2,240's.

Your last statement is doubtful. If true, we cannot trust Bitcoin either. Most cryptocurrencies use common encryption methods.
The security of cryptography isn't in obscurity. In fact, the most secure crypto has to be the most common and publicly known, auditable, etc.

\&gt; According to the leaked memos, the NSA ideally finds away around the encryption by grabbing text before it's encrypted or after it's decrypted.
\&gt; \[...\] collaborating with U.S. companies and building backdoors.
\&gt; \[...\] bugging major internet companies to make master encryption keys so that they could avoid the hassle of decryption.
Again, this is mostly about exploiting implementation flaws. We agreed on that. It's mostly side attacks that bypass the encryption altogether. The way you phrased your comments sounded more like the underlying math of encryption itself cannot be trusted.
I'm still not sold--going back to the original thread--that "governments have secret algorithms to undo most encryption."
Maybe we're just arguing semantics /shrug.
It's the difference being "well, I don't trust that wallet software or that encryption library because who knows, someone might have tampered with the implementation and introduced a hidden backdoor bug" versus, "disregard the bitcoin whitepaper altogether, the math is completely broken; there's a secret algorithm that trivially undoes the encryption scheme altogether."
