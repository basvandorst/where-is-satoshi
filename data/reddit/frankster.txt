If someone expects to make a profit from renting your mining capacity, why wouldn't you just use your mining capacity yourself and capture the entire benefit of the rigs yourself?
The business model only works if you expect that you would not make a profit from mining them yourself - or perhaps (to be charitable) if you feel that you don't want to expose yourself to the risk.

Bitcoin is going to eat about half of paypal's lunch unless they get on board with so its not at all surprising.
As I see it, paypal provide three services - one is transferring money around the world to an email address. Bit coin can do something similar for a fraction of the cost.
Another service that paypal provides is providing confidence in online transactions and ebay by refunding money if the buyer claims the seller did not deliver. Bitcoin doesn't compete here.
Paypal also provides checkout services but paypal there are several competitors in this market. So I don't expect bitcoin (or any bitcoin service provider) to make much dent here. Paypal perhaps has an opportunity to bring bitcoin into its checkout services if it feels like it wouldn't reduce its profits elsewhere.
It would be interesting to find out how much of paypal's profits can be attributed to each line of business.

I've been wondering how you would run a BTC exchange. Basically it means you need to have a roughly equal amount of e.g. CADs being converted to bit coins, and bitcoins being converted to CADs. 
I wonder if they've had a temporary imbalance that they haven't fixed.
@_date: 2012-09-12 11:59:08
This only works if noone else ever sees your certificate.
You could imagine someone proudly storing their certificate for 20 years, only to find when they chose to cash it in that some cunt had somehow got a copy of their certificate (photography?) and cashed it in 15 years ago.
The reason why paper bitcoin money is a shit idea (IMO) that will never work is that holding money in your hand means you by definition have that exact value of money. And it is guaranteed by the central bank.
Whereas the bitcoin certificate is only a proxy for the bitcoin. And just because the certificate is in your hand, there is no guarantee that the address/key exists, has ever existed, has any money in it or has ever had any money in it.
Essentially this bitcoin certificate is security through obscurity and trust and its well established that obscurity is a pretty bad level of security to rely on, in general. If either obscurity is broken (e.g. you get your certificate out in a room with CCTV) or trust is broken (you bought the certficiate off a dodgy individual) then the certificate is worthless.
What makes a bitcoin certificate even more dangerous is that if someone gives you a bitcoin certificate then there is no way of knowing if its worth what it claims to be worth. They could have already spent it.
So these certificates / paper wallets are infinitely shitter than paper money and will probably lead to scamming and fraud.
@_date: 2012-12-15 11:42:38
You would be better off buying them at market value then, which would be cheaper.
@_date: 2012-11-22 12:18:09
It does if they can prevent people converting between cash and bitcoins.
@_date: 2012-08-13 21:40:36
Yep, unless you have backed up your wallet! So pretty much what you would expect give that its essentially a document on a computer.
So I guess the number of backups you have of your wallet should be based on how much you have stored in it. At the very least back it up onto a USB stick I would say.
@_date: 2012-11-22 15:59:11
Well if you also had a way of converting between currencies without going via bitcoin then it would be ok. 
If not then I think for each currency you would need the bitcoin ingoings and outgoings to balance.
and yeah this amount of time is a pisstake.
@_date: 2012-08-17 14:58:04
Yeah but someone could pay you in bitcoins, then you could order stuff from an online merchant in bitcoins. Maybe sell it for cash if it was stuff you didn't want. Then there is no link between that person and you. And also you have got this stuff without cash going through your bank account. so double money laundering really!

accepting bitcoins with zero confirmations is somewhat dodgy isn't it?
@_date: 2013-04-22 17:37:09
Bitcoin isn't very good for live payments due to confirmation delays (its a lot slower than credit cards for example). Depending on the number of confirmations you want to wait for it can take many minutes (maybe hours) before you can be certain that you have the money in your wallet.
Payment by bitcoin is much more suited for mail order.
So while I congratulate you on your willingness to try new things, my gut feeling is that your business is not the right type to benefit from bitcoin payments.
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:47:34

Basically I wouldn't sell anything on ebay, only buy stuff. Its too slanted in the buyer's favour. For example, I bought a £150 piece of equipment off there but when it arrived it didn't work. I borrowed a power adapter for it and it did work. There was a place that sold power adaptors for £20 so I said can you knock £20 off and I'll replace the power adapter? The guy didn't reply so in the end I put in a dispute saying not as described, can you give me £20 back to replace the power supply? The guy still didn't reply so they refunded to me the entire £150 which I find completely inappropriate as I had only even asked for £20.
So basically this guy posted me a £150 bit of gear at his expense and ebay screwed him out of it because he didn't check his email or something. 
I would never ever sell anything on there, its far too risky.
