I would be very happy if Circle returned with their no-fee trading.

Ah why isn't GA allowed to use this?!
@_date: 2018-06-22 23:21:59
Hmm I thought we were early adopters?

I think you might have misunderstood me. I received an invite and downloaded the updated Circle Invest app. But it's not letting me log in, and the support has stopped replying. So I'm not sure what to do...

I agree. The trustee made an amateur mistake. They should have sold on the OTC markets like with Circle Trade and would have gotten more bang for their BTC.

If only they would expand to my state.
@_date: 2018-03-08 23:34:45
My state is not excluded. I think the app is faulty, but Circle support hasn't been helpful.

Focus on hard forks.

Hey would you want to read my Bitcoin thesis?
@_date: 2018-03-13 14:55:07
Nice! Customer service finally solved my problem too.
@_date: 2018-02-05 04:28:22
Yes, you can on BitMEX.
@_date: 2018-03-08 04:50:14
Are you using the Android app?

What do you think about the new exchange UPCoin?
@_date: 2018-02-03 16:49:35
For some lucky reason Gemini verified me after only three hours!
@_date: 2018-03-08 19:31:21
I want to try it so bad, but the app doesn't let me log in :(
@_date: 2018-02-17 23:13:18
Breaking the sell wall on GDAX was exciting!
@_date: 2018-03-04 20:48:07
Yes, in the US.
