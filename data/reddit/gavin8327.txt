Ordered mine there this morning... Had just moved BTC to an exchange so paid using Litecoin via shapeshift... Big mistake! 13% fee for shape shift. Rip off! Oh well,  bought something with crypto and supported a local business.

Hence a big reason why Bitcoin was created. Iflationary money essentially robs everyone annually. Arbitrarily making a push to consume more.
Just don't buy cryptocurrency if you're happy with fiat and fractional reserve banking. I mean, it did take 100 years to lose 98% buying power of the American dollar... So it's a fairly slow process of robbery.
I just bought something on Friday with Bitcoin, yes I replaced it afterwards with fiat. Consuming and investing...? Good luck.

People dca due to monetary constraints too sometimes... $100/ month might be the budget..  Just because it's cheap doesn't mean they can dump their $1200 annual budget because the price is low lol.
