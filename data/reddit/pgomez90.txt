There will be another bubble... 3rd I've seen so far in 4-5 years. It's the way btc grows it's a bubbler.

Difficulty rises everytime minning-power raises, so it's calculated to be all btc mined around year 2100.
For that time there will be many platforms/companies supporting It because they will need It working.
On the other hand, you can check other cryptos (like RaiBlocks or IOTA f.e.) with other ways to confirm transactions, and other ways like POS (Proof of Stake) instead of POW (Proof of Work) to reduce the energy cosumption or just the how-to that blockchains need to work.

Every year, mining tech goes better.
Anyway there are premined coins as Raiblocks, minning is not the only way of working.

I would advise to buy the dip, It's what I normally do, sold some too to rebuy. Anyway I didn't pretend to sound like an advisor, just wanted to make my point.

I guess tech will be more efficient with time

Thats why chain now have fees or gas (in ETH), to make profitable mining.

No, I meant that if I want to have a bit of my stack for quick trading, not all of it.

Yes... I already suffered the Cryptsy gate some years ago... Best way would always be having them in your (cold) hands.

Ironic as life itself.

I'm in Europe so Coinbase or Localbitcoin are the best choices (or just the easiest) for buying btc.
@_date: 2017-11-22 11:14:19
But I'm not able to buy from EU, so I think I will move it all to the cold wallet and transfer to BF those days I think I'll trade.
