What you saw done in this gif *was not statistics*.  You would know if it were statistics because, among other things, there would have been math involved.
If you still think what happened here was some form of statistics, please take a statistics course.  It's a fascinating field of mathematics that touches all our lives, and no part of it uses Photoshop as an analysis tool.

Yeah something was off about either the meme or the title...

Sorry if this is a tall order to ELI5, but what problem is the IRS presenting?  Is it that people were thinking they didn't need to report income from trades on Coinbase and now they have to, or is there something else I don't understand as an admitted n00b?
@_date: 2017-12-03 09:09:12
Oh.  Well.  They should have put that money out in the open like that.  If it's not hardware-secured, it's one IRS computer's heartbeat away from an auditor (or so I had assumed).
Thanks for the explanation.

This is a great explanation, and is going to help some people out there.  Thank you.

The linked gif..?
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:25:25
As opposed to what?  How can you move bitcoin without a wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:53:58
Sorry, n00b here:  Do I understand correctly was that OP used an easy-to-guess password on a wallet website, which was presumably being probed randomly for accounts and then fed easy passwords?  Or, did the attacker see the transfer and target him specifically?
Basically, what allowed this to happen and how can we avoid it?

Imagine if you could pay your power bill in BTC - miners would be laundering the shit out of their earnings.
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:01:57
I agree with you - I understand the HODL mentality, but I also have significant reservations about how quickly BTC could lose a great deal of value, and the way the charts all look like a bubble no matter how you see it.
I have relatively little doubt that the price will exceed $40k someday.  But the question is whether it hits $8k, or $3k, between now and then.  And of course that looming possibility that someday Bitcoin will have more value as digital antique souvenirs of that brief forray into "getting rich" with cryptocurrencies.
A new stance on regulation by the US government is probably the most likely catalyst for a profound drop in value.  But whatever precipitated a downturn, includung the exact threats you point out, every owner of Bitcoin needs to have a plan for $8k, $3k, and $400.
My best idea about this is a trading bot.  Now, I understand it's a different challenge, and perhaps a harder one, to get a bot to maintain value during a down-trending market (compared to a long bull run).  But if it were able to keep you out of the worst of it, it'd be worth its "weight" in Bitcoin.  I'm starting to play with zenbot a little and I think a great deal of simulation testing is in order, but we have great data - Sept 2013 up until as late as Apr 2016.  If a bot could keep out of that 2013-2014 downturn, it would make me much more comfortable.

Inb4 up or down

I see the first point, and the second point, but I honestly don't think there's a connection between them.  People will buy the plastic pennies - they value them at about $0.0349/ea.  Maybe it's so kids can play money-based games without having real money in play, I dunno.
@_date: 2019-11-17 19:08:36


Yeah, makes sense...


Ok, sure...




Definitely - sounds good.


Noooope.  Guess I'll just stay poor (but not too poor to be able to afford warm water).

Oh oh I want in!  No risk, chance of reward?  Let's do it!
@_date: 2019-10-07 05:28:22
They are - they have very distinct personalities, and are goofy.  And fairly easy to take care of, and you don't have to have some big secondary industry like milking or butchering them, aside from shearing once a year.

I bought 14 alpacas for an average of about $70/ea and every year I get about 100lbs of their fiber that can become socks.
So, if anyone wants some 17BTC alpaca socks, HMU.

They were geldings, and both ranches we bought them from were downsizing.  The first four were $62.50/each!

Ok well I hodled on the everything so :-P

Give it a couple years.  When you're old enough to have a job and earn money, you'll find a nice stable mutual fund and it'll work great for you.
@_date: 2018-02-05 03:39:24
But in the opposite order, ideally.
Then profit.

Mmmmm probably not.
