Segwit transactions are much cheaper. The sender address has to be a segwit address (starts with a "3" or "bc1") It doesn't matter where you're sending to.

Ohh no the smart money is leaving bitcoin ;((

No. They have a 684% satisfaction rate. They're so good.

Yes. Even sooner maybe. My tx was dropped from the mempool after a few days.

What is unregulated? KYC AML? You don't know what you are talking about.

Quality shitpost again...

It doesn't matter where you are. You pay 20 times higher fees because of coinbase, xapo and blockchaininfo
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:12:20
It's interesting that 90% of these tether/bitfinex fudsters are bcash/segwit2x shills, trolls. I wonder why. :)
@_date: 2018-01-20 14:13:52
Blockchain.info still haven't implemented segwit. You have to transfer all of your funds to a segwit compatible wallet (trezor, samourai, more in the article) to take advantage of segwit.
Here is a long but very good post about segwit. I would recommend that you read the faq in the middle first.
@_date: 2018-01-20 10:27:47


What would be the solution? 
@_date: 2018-01-28 11:20:55
bisq.network it's a decentralized exchange.

Bittrex is a scam they stole a lot of money from unverified users 4 months ago. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:53:56
Nothing. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:02:48
So you don't want regular people to run full nodes... only big corporations. Go back to r/btrash fucking dipshit.
Educate youself! Segwit is a blocksize increase. You need these shitty companies like coinbase, blockchain.info, xapo, bitbay, bitgo to implement segwit.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:48:35
Ok I'm very nice today. Let me explain it. The reason these companies (though they signed nya/SEGWIT2x) won't implement segwit isn't that some guys on the internet were mean to them. You're welcome.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:29:08
Paying taxes is society and parasites like you and your family stealing from him.
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:51:04
Newcomers usually don't know anything about fees and the difference between these exchanges.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:42:21


Because companies that make the majority of the txs won't implement segwit. Which would clear the mempool as you said.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:54:01
I'm sorry to hear that pal.
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:11:03
I'm sure you cucks keep your fiat in banks. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:08:58
I could say the same things about successful, altruistic/philanthropic people.
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:23:33
Do you keep your money in banks, or you're just another dipshit spewing this bs?
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:06:04
I don't know man. Actually I never contacted their support, but I always managed to withdraw without any problem. For finex, they always replied and solved my issue in 2 days. (disabling u2f, etc)
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:47:52
The only parasites are people who don't work, pay little to no taxes, yet they still use the welfare system. That's why decent people call these and their useless children welfare parasites.
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:11:05
Then go bitching to coinbase to implement segwit. That would cut your fees in half immediately.
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:51:43

There is more to that. First, a handful of companies can't decide for millions of people and other businesses.
Not to mention the quality of coders that created their node...
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:38:45


Not a shill I see :) Just saying segwit IS a block-size increase, and much more (I'm sure you knew this ;)) So why not using segwit addresses which is already coded in and much more easier, cheaper than a contentious hard fork.
@_date: 2017-12-16 07:48:15
Yeah implementing btrash is much more important than segwit.
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:11:55

So we don't need to increase the block-size beacause we already have segwit. Great. Why don't you guys complaining to coinbase, blockchain.info, etc to use segwit addresses?

This ignorance is unreal... There are no "segwit coins" and there are no "regular coins". Only bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:31:47
Never said they're controlling bitcoin. We don't need a blocksize increase. We need segwit adoption by companies especially wallet providers.
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:46:28
Right. Huge thanks to government regulation like bitlicense etc.
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:18:14
Needless to say you don't need to pay even a dollar if you don't need your transaction to confirm in a few hours. Which you obviously don't.

Only to 75k. I would say.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:02:07
You must be retarded. The fees are high because coinbase, blockchain.info, etc don't use segwit addresses. Segwit IS a blocksize increase.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:10:45
Doesn't matter who wrote the article. The bug actually prevented the fork. So yeah coinbase, shapeshit, roger ver, and their quality programmers. :)
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:22:43
Because almost nobody uses it. With a 90%+ adoption rate the mempool would be cleared.

@_date: 2017-12-19 21:07:49
Yeah the problem that companies like coinbase and blockchain.info don't use segwit addresses.
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:19:36
Don't use bitcoin if you don't like something dumbfuck... btw this is exactly due to regulation.

@_date: 2017-12-20 00:16:02
A new version of the bitcoin core has to be adopted too by the same players.
I don't know exactly how many lines of code coinbase need to implement segwit, but I highly doubt it's several hundred. But even if you're right, hundred lines of code for multi billion dollar businesses is nothing. They raised $75M in jan, and  $100M in aug. That would be enough to hire a few people. Ohh shit they haven't even started to hire...

I noticed you haven't mentioned segwit. Which is already here. Businesses just have to use it.
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:29:14
Bitfinex, Poloniex, Bitmex, Bitstamp. I only use bitfinex and polo, but bitfinex is my all time fav. Their interface is the best among cryptoexchanges, and you don't need to verify.
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:10:04

fraudulent behavior surrounding bitcoin hahahh what about the dollar? billion or trillion times more
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:53:18
It would be very difficult and extremely expensive due to government regulation like bitlicense. This is the only reason this shithole called coinbase is still in business.
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:49:32
I completely agree. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:20:50
Ok so what should happen? Blocksize increase won't do shit. Just in case you mention it as a solution.

Until decentralized exchanges become actually usable people have to use these exchanges.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:19:16
If you don't want to withdraw fiat you're not required to verify. That's the best thing about them. I withdrawn crypto several times without any problem.
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:44:01
It is exactly. They're implementing btrash instead of segwit.
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:34:13
I never said he's not lying lol
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:54:07

Go back to r/btrash dipshit troll!
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:11:21
With a 100mb blocksize you'll lose all of the full nodes except the biggest mining pools and companies like coinbase. At that point it would be better to go bank to use legacy banks... 100mb in a few years is just stupid I don't care who said it.
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:45:07
Yeah. So there is no reason to blame the victims when exchanges or wallet providers refuse to give their money back.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:59:14
Why the fuck would you ever give away your transaction history to anyone. That's a terrible idea. That would defeat the purpose of bitcoin.

Trezor uses segwit addresses by default you don't have to do anything, but you can send from your old (non-segwit) addresses from the legacy wallet option in the menu. Btw segwit addresses start with either "3" or "bc1", and legacy addresses start with a "1"
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:16:14
That's tax optimization my friend. Even Google, Apple, politicians do that in other ways...

@_date: 2017-12-20 07:30:41
haha compromise... Everyone has to use bigger blocks, but segwit is optional, which means nya companies will never implement it. So no mallebility fix for LN. I think the compromise is here. We don't use bigger blocks until segwit is 100% adopted.

Bitfinex (only for non-US people), poloniex, bitmex, bitstamp, gemini, binance (very new exchange)

So what would you like to happen? imho a block-size increase won't do anything to decrease fees. Maybe a 100mb+, but then we're left with a blockchain so big that only the mining pools and exchanges can afford to handle.

That's a fucking terrible idea... Banks could prevent any tx they/goverments don't like. What's the fucking point of bitcoin then?

No need to be butthurt over this.
This is the official stance of Coinbase and their CEO Brian Armstrong.


@_date: 2017-11-10 17:19:51
I feel the same way. I would never give my ID to these companies. Equifax hack, yahoo hack, etc... I ended up verifying with my phone number and withdraw every single satoshi.

@_date: 2017-11-29 17:23:02
Try bitfinex.com or bitmex.com with a vpn like 
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:41:09
0.025btc daily. Which is nothing, and you lose a lot on withdraw fees 0.001btc. The problem is they changed their policy without warning. Basically dfrauding their customers. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:32:50
Why wouldn't you tell us how much money you have on your bank accounts or why don't you show your balances?
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:59:56
That girl is a keeper.
@_date: 2017-11-07 01:02:15
Transaction size is affected by the number of outputs and inputs your tx has. Bigger transaction size means higher fees.
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:55:28
I certainly don't.
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:35:47
I hope you'll get your coins back. Try bitfinex next time. Never had a problem. No verification, nothing.
@_date: 2017-11-06 08:46:48
You love a little bit of arse licking here and there. I see... :)

Because it's not Vitalik's and his rich friends' money...
@_date: 2017-11-09 17:38:10
So how would Coinbase benefit from bigger blocks? You're not the brightest bulb in the box...
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:30:46
With a 0.025btc withdraw limit, and the withdraw fees are so high (0.001btc) you would lose most of your money on it... Ohh I can blame them changing their policy without any warning or a period to let people withdraw their money. Money laundering hahah It's interesting their laundered money was good for these fraudsters until they paid a lot of fees... If you let everyone know how much money you have and where you're just fucking dumb.
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:10:31
Ignoring either sides would be just plain dumb. People don't want to throw away 10-15% of their money .
@_date: 2017-11-09 18:35:55
wtf They signed nya/SEGWIT2x. What are you talking about they never signed anything...
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:07:47

I'm in my spaceship going to the moon.
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:42:23
No, they're not. They still accept money from unverified users. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 18:38:16
Easy reading. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:54:21
You do realize that these shitty companies (shapeshift, bitpay, coinbase, blockchain.info) bitching about high transaction fees won't use segwit addresses. Interesting isn't it?
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:59:34
I think they're chinese. Ver's pool is bitcoin.com.
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:07:17
The difficulty of BCH chain would go up and that would make it even less profitable to mine, and then miners would have to sell bch to pay their bills.
I agree with you. It's not that simple.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:18:42
What is the value of anything apart from others thinking it's valuable?
@_date: 2017-11-07 01:09:59
Voorhees used that specific block because it served his agenda. That tx could have been anyone's.
@_date: 2017-11-20 00:10:24
* coinbase /GDAX
* blockchain.info
* xapo
* shapeshift.io
* bitpay
* gemini
* btcc.com
* btc.com / bitcoin.com
* bitgo
* bitmain ofc...
* all of the big mining pools except f2pool and slush maybe?
@_date: 2017-11-23 15:08:28
At least she can't get her dirty hands on your bitcoins...
@_date: 2017-11-09 18:45:14
Then any government could take over Bitcoin development.
90-95% of the industry  (users, nodes, exchanges, businesses) is against shitcoin2x.
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:06:27
Would you care the explain how they benefit from small blocks? No? ok :)
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:03:19
Coinbase/GDAX is going to call B2X Bitcoin/BTC. So they'll replace your coins with segwit2x altcoin that worth 10% of Bitcoin. I don't think that's a good idea to use any of the NYA companies...
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:41:31
I see you're ignorant so I'll be very nice :) you can thank me later. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 17:28:56
So true. Government regulation killed and prevents it.
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:41:52


Why don't they use segwit addresses then? Your assumption is completely false.
@_date: 2017-11-07 06:12:33


Why the fuck did they sign the nya/SEGWIT2x if they have no intention to use that shit?
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:26:21
They supported segwit2x and wanted to rename bitcoin to something else, and give the btc ticker to this altcoin. 
Read this: 
And their customer support is hands down the worst in the industry.
@_date: 2017-11-07 21:51:52
So those who did not want segwit don't have to use it, but they get 2mb blocks, but 2mb blocks are mandatory for those who only wanted segwit... That's not compromise.
@_date: 2017-11-01 17:18:20
@_date: 2017-11-09 17:26:35
They signed nya/SEGWIT2x you cuck...
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:43:48
Do shapeshift use SegWit addresses? They signed nya/SEGWIT2x after all... :)
@_date: 2017-11-09 17:34:28
So why the fuck do you want bigger blocks? You would have the same problems (high fees, mempool congestions) in 3 months... Why do you even eat? You'll be hungry in 3 hours. Pathetic moron...
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:44:45
Only in that article. They're going to call shitcoin2x B2X in the wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-04 19:55:11
Do any of the NYA aka SEGWIT2x companies (like coinbase, xapo, blockchain.info, shapeshift) use SegWit addresses? No? Interesting...
I thought the whole point of this agreement was to get faster and cheaper transactions...
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:26:04
I don't think such regulation exist. For example Poloniex has a $2000 daily limit  for unverified users. And they don't have so ridiculously high withdrawal fess.
@_date: 2017-11-24 16:40:47
First you obviously don't know what discriminating means. Second I don't have any respect for that woman so I can't show it. And anyway go fuck yourself, don't tell me what to do!
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:27:13
Bittrex is shady as fuck. Few months ago they decided unverified user won't be allowed to withdraw anything... They basically stole a lot of money then.
@_date: 2017-11-19 10:14:09
Coinbase/gdax, blockchain.info, xapo, shapeshift, bitpay, btc.com make their customers pay these ridiculously high fees...
@_date: 2017-11-09 18:34:11
SegWit is part of the nya. That's why they should use it not because they owe it to op. Right?
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:33:47
Let me educate you. They supported segwit2x and wanted to rename bitcoin to something else, and give the btc ticker to this altcoin. Read this:  And their customer support is hands down the worst in the industry.
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:16:57

My comment meant something else you did not quite understand, but here I go.
* They decoded those pictures and now they're storing it on their hdd, or they possessed it for quite a long time.
* They're possessing the bitcoin blockchain which contains these images and they have the tools to extract it.
* Not to mention they put those things on the blockchain just so they can stumble upon it
* They're now distributing this content.

I'm sure localbitcoin users who had to go to jail feel the same way.
@_date: 2017-10-23 13:28:28
Everything is gambling, but OP is still just a butthurt bitch...
@_date: 2018-02-21 18:02:26
You're so right. Don't waste that precious $0.20!
@_date: 2018-02-12 16:32:13


So what's the fucking point of bitcoin then? We should just use banks...

Don't forget blockchain.info.

He sold it over four months, started september through several exchanges. Daily volume on bitfinex is 40k+ today, and it was over 100k in jan. The trustee selling 35k had negligible impact on the price.
Look at these fucking headlines: 


This fud by "news" portals caused the sell off.
@_date: 2017-10-29 15:38:37
Modalert from ModaPharma, but customs confiscated it. hahah
@_date: 2018-02-17 23:20:36
I feel sorry for those who sold at 10k yesterday.
@_date: 2017-10-30 16:54:45
The end justifies the means. Brian Armstrong and Fred Ehrsam (ex-goldman sachs) are obnoxious people. They deserve it.  Anyway, relax they won't go out of business over my comment. They might lose 1-2 customers (I hope) but that's all. Cheers.

Google is your best friend. Trust me.
@_date: 2017-10-29 18:12:03
I hope these retarded commies will shut down mining as well...
@_date: 2017-10-30 20:48:34
You mean coinbase, blockchain.info and xapo who support the shitcoin2x. Yeah I agree.
@_date: 2018-02-15 16:37:00
What is bitcoin? Never heard of it.
@_date: 2018-03-03 16:17:58
Someone put his socialist tinfoil hat on today hahah.
@_date: 2017-10-29 18:19:59

@_date: 2017-10-29 20:35:37

@_date: 2017-10-30 22:39:01
Stop kidding yourself!
@_date: 2017-10-25 18:14:51
And that fucking guy called Bitcoin a fraud... Give me a fucking break.
@_date: 2017-10-23 13:31:37
I don't think op has enough intelligence to comprehend such issues.
@_date: 2017-10-28 09:08:00
Nah. Coinbase is going to call b2x bitcoin/btc... and they're going to change btc to something else.
@_date: 2017-10-23 13:26:11
Why are you bitching and moaning like a little girl? No need to be butthurt over reddit...
@_date: 2017-10-23 14:37:17
@_date: 2018-02-17 23:29:45

@_date: 2017-10-29 18:06:40
1. They stole their customers' BCH and BTG
2. Customer support don't respond to anything.
3. 
4. They're supporting the attack on Bitcoin called NYA.
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:19:20
hahah you're the most butthurt user on reddit by far...
@_date: 2017-10-30 17:04:35
What would you expect from wired? A bunch of sjw/feminazis/commies/dumbfucks... putting your seed sheet under your daughter's pillow.. just fucking gold.
@_date: 2018-02-15 17:41:01
Shit bitcoin is crashing... it's only 9980 now :(
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:39:15
Actually where I live you can buy/sell &lt; $250 without verification, you need a phone number for &lt; $1200, and above that you need to verify. It's not so bad but back then no ID or phone number was required so we're going in the wrong direction. And the fees were really low around 4%.


It could be.
@_date: 2017-10-29 15:44:28
Meanwhile fucking antpool is mining empty blocks...
@_date: 2017-10-24 15:09:38

I love volatility.
@_date: 2017-10-30 17:10:05


Just look at your address bar... You don't have to be a Sherlock to know the answer. :)
@_date: 2017-10-23 13:19:37
Fuck off moron! You're boring as fuck... Everything is gambling. You can't predict the future with your tiny brain.
@_date: 2017-10-24 15:27:52
Nah. I just replied to you. That doesn't mean I'll take your advice.
@_date: 2017-10-17 16:54:55
Because they scam.
@_date: 2017-10-24 14:59:10

If you can afford a lambo, just leave that fucking shithole and buy citizenship somewhere else.

@_date: 2018-04-15 07:24:12
Not expensive if you mine most of the blocks...
@_date: 2017-07-05 15:21:12
Localbitcoins.com, ATM, etc.
@_date: 2017-07-05 15:14:22
Of course you don't think it's bad, because it's not your money.
@_date: 2017-07-05 14:57:11
Coinbase/GDAX are much worse than MtGox...
@_date: 2018-04-12 18:18:25
You mean coin in.
@_date: 2017-07-05 15:06:31
