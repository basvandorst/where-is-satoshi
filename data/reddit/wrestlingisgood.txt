Part of me kind of hoped it would go on the exchange, the price may drop but more people could buy it. 
@_date: 2014-01-31 18:53:15
Sadly this is the answer I am getting. 
I want to see what educated people think about bitcoin, not high school kids, not computer nerds, not even people who made money off bitcoins. 
I want to know what people with a degree in economics think about this new currency. 
It is like saying "i want to talk to an astronomer about black holes" and you get a kid with a telescope rather than stephen hawking.  
@_date: 2014-01-02 11:31:49
Don't like 90 people controll 1/2 of all bitcoins or something? I am not saying it won't change but right now it seems like a 1% deal going on right now.

Don't you think if they thought there was money in bitcoin they would be the first aboard the bitcoin train?

I am not sure if there is a way to trace how BTC are spent considering their anonymity. 
My theory is, that since there are so few places that take them, so many people holding them and so many black markets taking them, it only makes sense that it is hoarders and black markets doing most of the bitcoining.

Explain how it can expand **their** businesses. Talk about **their money** make this about them. 
As with any business talk about how it can help their side, perhaps teach people in the snack bar how to use btc.

We shouldn't have gambling, drugs and alcohol be the main uses of this currency. It needs to look clean for the media.

@_date: 2014-01-15 00:54:00
Silk Road is among one of many black markets. There is very little you can do wth btc right now, there are only a few options, gift cards, overstock, small  businesses, black market. 
That is about it. Overstock is the only real large company that accepts them, most people don't know gyft, a few scattered small businesses use them, but that is a small niche, the black market in my opinion is where bitcoins thrive the most.  
Silk Road is not the only illegal website that takes bitcoin, there are lots more illegitimate ways to spend btcs then legitimate ones.

No bad news about bitcoins ever. 
They spin bad news like it is good news and downvote you to the point of a self perpetuating circlejerk.

@_date: 2014-01-31 18:40:57
If btc had a bank with FDIC insurance then people would be more likely to use it, but btc is "anti bank" or something, so people see it as just another forex trading market.

@_date: 2014-09-23 23:42:31
And take a little off the top, which is what bitcoin was meant to avoid. 
@_date: 2014-01-14 21:14:54
Overstock is a big company, but it cannot do it alone. 
So far, it is the ONLY mainstream use for BTC that is legal. The rest is usually black market drugs. 
@_date: 2014-02-11 21:11:54


Which can be mean sometimes, especially to newcomers, which discourages use of mainstream people. 


Such as what exactly? 


No one knows how to buy bitcoin, that is the problem, the community is too elite to tell the non-techies how to buy. In my opinion the key to adoption is ease, everyone and their grandmother needs to know how to buy. If people are mean to newcomers (the people who we need the most) then people will not want bitcoin to succeed. 
@_date: 2014-01-31 18:21:06


Well if I lose any digital money I have with a bank, I sleep soundly knowing that money is FDIC insured. With btc if I get attacked by a hacker, I am done, I lost everything. 
@_date: 2014-01-14 03:03:58
Yes, but the hope is that they put that money into the btc economy when the time is right. 
@_date: 2014-01-31 21:53:14

@_date: 2014-09-23 22:02:02
I'm confused, didn't we rail against paypal a few months ago? 
@_date: 2014-01-26 02:10:45
You made that. 
@_date: 2014-02-11 21:15:55
Yes and no. 
I think this is a serious setback and if nothing changes then all chance of mainstream use is gone, it will tread water where it is now, it may even shrink to a smaller community. 
If something came along that revolutionized bitcoin (a new easy to use exchange took mtgox place or some new bitcoin innovation or a major retailer such as target announced they would accept bitcoin) then bitcoin would have a chance. 
@_date: 2014-01-11 01:09:27
Disagreeing is not trolling though. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 00:48:22
But how can "John Everyman" see BTC as a savior rather than just "That thing the kids are into".
@_date: 2014-01-31 18:48:34
Whether that is or is not the case, I would prefer an economist to a developer when talking about financial matters. Especially since money is on the line. 
@_date: 2014-01-02 08:23:24
That is an enormous hazard to anyone driving who may get a windshield full of blinding fliers. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 00:53:26
Well what is that thing then? I still don't see how the average person can use it or would want to invest yet, it shows a lot of promise, but what will john everyman want to do with it.

And that highlights some of the flaws BTC has as a currency, I would gladly put all my money in Yen or Pesos if I had a good reason to because I know that my money would be secured by the govt. and the banks, 2 things that BTC is supposedly fighting against.  
@_date: 2014-01-14 03:12:42
Honesty is the only route you can go on. 
The fact is bitcoin is very unstable, it can lose money overnight. 
Tell them they can reduce the risk by cashing out of btc immediately after they get them. 
@_date: 2014-01-02 09:01:56
Why, a bitcoin bank would mean more people using it as a financial instrament rather than a niche currency.

I don't use steam I only know one other person that does, but most people just don't use it. 
It is also still an online company, if we could get a huge store to sell or accept BTC it would be much more effective.

Why would they do that? They need the money now, they can't wait on bitcoin while people go hungry and cats need neutering.

"Uninformed" Critics is code for anyone who doesn't agree with the general opinion. 
The fact that Bitcoins has a few flaws is a statement that always leads to downvotes. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 01:58:45
When the average person thinks of cybercrime and online drugs they think of BTC not the USD. 
They know the USD can be used to buy other stuff, BTC is a niche right now and unless we can prove to the world that it is not a drug and crime currency, that is how it will be viewed.

Could we have a bot that automatically updates an image, say it could take a screen cap once every 10 min. and put it on the sidebar and replace the old image?
That way we can always see BTC to USD value, even if it is just an image and not in real time.
@_date: 2013-12-17 20:17:57
It is great that they stop censorship, but they need to also ensure that their network is fighting criminals.

- Just stick to the **FACTS**.
- Do not make promises you can't keep. 
- Be confident. 
- "I Don't Know" is an acceptable answer, it is always better than lying. 
- They don't care what you think, they care what experts think.
- Remember, this is for THEIR benefit, not YOURS. 
- Tell THEM why bitcoin benefits THEM and makes THEM money. (They are more interested in THEM, it is not selfishness, it is just business)

I think at this point we are circle jerking around the issue, we both agree that anonymous activity is a necessary evil. 
It can be used for activism, but it is also used for crime, we just disagree on whether or not TOR is being responsible, I think that they should have some ability to shut down some websites, but it needs to be limited. 
You disagree and I respect your opinion, however, I feel as if this argument is going around in circles.

Let's be honest, no one will do math every time they want a hamburger from mcdonalds. If this currency has any chance in the real world, it needs a conversion rate. It needs a Big Mac index so to speak. 
1 ubtc or mbtc whichever is worth $1 right now, will seamlessly get you 1 hamburger, just like 1 USD will.

As more people mine and there are less btc people may just stop mining them, besides it is just a theory I do not know how many btc can be mined or how long it will take.
Just curious to know what will happen. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 23:24:16
I hope it latches onto the dollar a little bit. 
(Let me explain why).
The dollar is the world's currency, it backs other currency. 
If the exchange rate was hovering around $1 for 1 mBTC, more people would invest because it is simple.
People like simple things.

Begging/asking for bitcoins is absolutely not allowed, no matter how badly you need the bitcoins. Only requests for donations to large, recognized charities are allowed, and only if there is good reason to believe that the person accepting bitcoins on behalf of the charity is trustworthy.

My honest guess is that if a major retailer accepts them, and it catches on soon, it will be worth a lot.

Now I don't know much about economics but insurance (FDIC govt. at least) seems unlikely.

What about the added threat of how anonymous BTC are? they could be stolen and placed into an account without anyone knowing who that account belongs to. 
Not to mention there are many BTC laundering services on TOR.

Again, two very different things. 
Physical privacy as opposed to digital privacy are very different. 
Digital privacy is important to an extent. 
If you are running a drug den, then the authorities at least know where to raid, if you are selling drugs online, then the anonymity of the internet is protecting dealers. 
I think even if we don't know who is running these websites, we should still have the ability to shut them  down.

Well despite your philosophic view of the usd it is not seen as a criminal currency, and the public views bitcoin to at least some level as a criminal currency. 
Due to the shutdown of Silk Road, the dark net and cryptolocker who advertises bitcoins as a way to pay criminals to get your stuff back. 
I really think cryptolocker or viruses like it can kill bitcoins. They advertise it as an anonymous currency that the FBI can't trace and you have to buy to keep your family photos.

I go to a lot of wrestling events and often do get my signs on at least local cameras. 
The trick may not be to be the most clever, it is all about sitting in the right seat.
- Find out where the "TV section" is. 
- Find out where cameramen are stationed.
- Determine what the audience wants to see.
- Are you going to be in the background or will they focus on you between matches because you have the sign
- Have kids hold the sign. (In this case it may be exploitative to do so though, but kids love to be on TV).
- Be noticeable.

Whether they mean to or not, sadly what they created is a haven for narcotic sales, child pornography, illegal weapons/small arms sales and a lot of other "shady" activity. 
They may not directly encourage it but the fact that this level of anonymity exists does to an extent encourage it indirectly.

Assuming it does level off, after all that, we have to assume that since people like simple things, it will level off at 1 ubtc being about $1 or $5 somewhere in between. People like simplicity, it has to have an easy conversion rate to the USD.

This could be where alt coins are the most useful. 
By trading Altcoins for Bitcoins, it ensures that Altcoins have a fair price and they can be mined. 
This also ensure that the average person can mine.

@_date: 2013-12-12 23:19:43
Slightly ironic that you sell wallets for paper, but you only accept BTC and in your photo it shows a USD, perhaps add a BTC paper wallet and take out the dollar to show people they can carry that around instead.
I love the design, but how big are they?

@_date: 2013-11-28 03:45:06
It have the govt. ~175k bitcoins.
If they wanted to sell them off in liquidation it could crash bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 00:10:58
But who would do it?
Not everyone has $1000 in their account. 
I only have 13 USD.
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:26:16
- No one accepting them
- another Silk Road 
- they become famous because of cryptolocker or other Ransomware 
- a crash caused by anything
- regulation 
- I am curious to see how mining caps will effect them. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 00:28:11
I cannot help you there I apologize.

Wow bitcoin has gotten so bad they put the number of the suicide hotline on their front page. 
That is how I know bitcoin has fallen. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 21:08:13
What the hell could he be working on that is bigger than BTC?
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:53:37
Just go to an animal shelter or check Swedish Craigslist. 
I am sure you will stumble across " guitar lessons and pugs, the pug had pups, free to good home guitar lessons $100 a week 2x a week"

That is one of the main rules of investing anyway.

Lets put that on this subreddit. 
Not a link, but a real time view.

Well what do you think is coming...

Vandalizing a church. 
That is low.

What is pay.reddit.com? 
@_date: 2013-11-28 22:24:26
If I don't cash out and it goes down, that could be $15 lost. 
Now that I gained it, why not walk away? 
@_date: 2013-12-12 19:22:49
If I had the money to do it, I totally would. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 19:56:43
As I said, by allowing them to remain anonymous they are indirectly encouraging them. 
Whether they mean to or not, they are allowing criminals to continue their enterprise. 
I understand that they want to protect free speech, but they are not doing enough to combat the problem they helped create. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 22:08:35
It needed something like this, an easy conversion rate from btc to USD.

Why did he leave the project?
@_date: 2013-11-27 22:18:49
Honestly, sell of your btc for usd and buy it that way. 
It may be the only way that you can do it right now.
@_date: 2013-12-17 20:31:56
Thank you for a civil discussion, I understand why you feel that some websites need to be free of government control for the sake of personal freedom. 
You have a valid viewpoint and I respect you and your viewpoint. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 18:15:37
First I want to remind you of a few small rules of pitching ideas:
- "I Don't Know" is an acceptable answer, it is always better than lying. 
- They don't care about your opinion at all. They want to know how THEY can make money off of this. 
- **CITE SOURCES** 
- Stick to facts. 
Now, from what I understand, DDOS is possible to the exchanges. which can hurt prices. 
Other security concerns involve theft of BTC.
 
Risk vs. Reward.
That is speculative. 
Market Cap. 
Prices, I do not know. 
Expect to be asked "What are they?" "How do they work?" "What is a reasonable return?"

$16,000? No way! 
Don't put all your eggs in 1 basket! That is the first rule of investing. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 23:53:00
So the govt. now has the power to crash BTC?
@_date: 2013-12-17 20:41:54
THEY ARE A PUMP AND DUMP SCHEME!
A boiler room! 
@_date: 2013-12-19 09:00:36
- Tulips had a limited supply.


- Most tulips were bought with "Contracts" and very few people actually held physical tulips. 


- Bitcoins may have some properties that make it a good currency, but the volatility make them high risk and no one will put all their money into such a high risk market, especially when their low risk and government insured money is sitting in a bank. Not to mention it can only be spent on a few small markets. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 08:45:15
What I was trying to explain in a nutshell. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 10:00:26
But we do know that he is the best in the world. We do know he has what it takes to be the voice of the voiceless! 
(But I digress) 
Right now BTC is accepted almost nowhere.
@_date: 2013-12-13 01:54:22
Same with BTC.
Same with other Forex currency. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:14:00
To be fair, tulips were NOT a Ponzi scheme, they were a bubble. 
There is a huge difference. 
A Ponzi scheme is set up by a person or a group and they claim to borrow your money to invest by that money goes to paying off old investors as well as for themselves. 
A bubble is usually social, think about if a stock has great news then goes out of business. The stock went up then it popped and left investors struggling to get their money back. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 02:04:19
It is so dead, the Ramsey's were acquitted of any wrongdoing in the involvement of their death.
@_date: 2013-12-17 21:13:17
I am blaming the people who assist (directly or indirectly) in making sure the murderer is anonymous, if you want to use that example. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 00:13:16
I love that show!!
Remember the Jewish slaughterhouse one? Holy crap, what a bastard! 
What about those 9/11 FAKERS! What kind of dick does that?
I digress though. I would not invest in anything that promises a lot for a little. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:44:52
It is not impossible. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 23:15:34
A repressive nation doesn't like the freedom of BTC, color me shocked. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 01:06:24
Maybe just a way to automatically say the value of BTC. 
Provides a link to the website with an aprox. value?
@_date: 2013-12-17 08:10:47
Can we figure out who's IP address keeps doing this and ban them?

Why buy a TV now? 
Why not wait until Cyber Monday?

Both are commodities.

Memes I understand but discussion, no matter how poor, about comparing it to other currencies must be allowed. 
We need to allow dissenting opinions, not just allow but welcome.

Thank you. 
Good Night, and Good Luck.

If they don't recover from just one of them then BTC is over. 
BTC has to get lucky and bounce back every time.

It is so dead, zimmerman got aquitted for shooting it.

So invest a little yourself if you want, I only have $13 worth of btc that is about 0.01 BTC no amount is too small, do it for fun not money.

I will sooner give my bitcoins to the terrorists.
@_date: 2013-11-28 00:22:56
Hell if I know, it was just an idea i thought up for the mods, I hope they see this and maybe figure out a way how. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 01:32:13
That is great, but with the volatility of BTC, no one is going to heavily invest to save $10.
The risk is just too high. 
@_date: 2013-12-31 23:51:22
Conspiracy theorist believing that the govt. really cares that much about bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 20:37:17
It is CNBC, I think they are pretty trustworthy, granted I think they may have had a typo, I still find it interesting.
Also, this article is a few hours old, it is not exactly up to the min.

Just a quick overview, you have cocktails at 0.01 btc, why a fixed price? Why not let each bar decide?

I agree, if btc is so weak that reddit can crash it, it should be crashed. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 21:50:26
It started off as only $1 that someone tipped me a while ago, but I don't think it can get too much bigger these are not seen as a way to buy things, no one accepts them. 
Sure you can buy a few things, but you can't shop ebay, target or any major places. 
Yea you can get gift cards and whatever shoplify is, but I just don't see it getting bigger and if I can't buy anything with them, then I prefer a cash option.

Save The Children?
I worked for them for a little bit!!!
I wish they would have let me accept BTC when I was begging for donations on the street for them, it would have been easier to stop the tech savvy people and maybe get them to donate.
@_date: 2013-12-18 00:44:02
You made that.
