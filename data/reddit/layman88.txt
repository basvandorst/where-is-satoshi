Sorry, what are the 'fundamentals' that everyone keeps talking about?

I'm not laughing at anyone honestly. It's the same situation in which you observe a bunch of con artists preying on tourists. Do you just shake your head and walk on? Or do you try to gently help out the tourists?
This subreddit is rather cruel from what I can see and it churns my stomach. Full of people trying to pump up interest for new 'investors' while telling existing investors to hold onto their coins. There is no such thing as easy money in this world, and that alone should've been ringing the alarms in your head. 
So for now, I just want to be that guy who cuts in and pulls those tourists away from those con artists.

The best is when Bitcoin backers repeatedly cry "the fundamentals haven't changed!". WHAT fundamentals? This thing is only backed by the value brought in from new investors/speculators. Ie. you only make money when new patsies come in to replace you.
People clamour for an unregulated currency/exchange and scream foul when greedy bastards come in and game the system. This was never destined to end well.

"i have $180,000 in bit coin and trust me..."

It's backed by the value brought in from new potential speculators.ie. A Ponzi scheme.
As confidence in the scheme is shaken, less people will be clamoring to get in, and existing coin holders will feel the pain.

Index arb desk here. And yes, this sub reddit is hilaaarious. Especially when people are saying "HOLD!" as they try to preserve whatever value is left in their useless assets. Classic Ponzi scheme and a good study on human nature.
