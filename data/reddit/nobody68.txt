Well, there was mistake. BTC protocol can handle cca. 300 mil. TX/Year, this means tha approx. 5 bil. people can open and close LN chanell only one time in 30 years. :D

First thank all Core developers for their huge work. But for me your agruments are totaly wrong. It is strong necessary to do concensus with miners and save investments all participants in Bitcoin comunity. For example SW + 8MB hardfork and part of this concensus should be that every mining pools have to  run a some numbers of full nodes. I am running bitcoin core wallet i.e. full node on my personal computer.  When I have insufficient space on HDD I will run full node on dedicated server, no problem. 1 MB fixed block and high fee kill bitcoin adoptions (and Bitcoin) , kill home mining, kill mining at all in the future and will also cause high fee in LN. Bitcoin is  close to mature time now, mining done big steps in professionalisation invest a lot of money, the same way should go full nodes, because investment in node is only a little compare to mining. How many space of  GB or TB has your personal photos and videos on your HDD compare to blockchain ? Everybody watch video and IPTV on their TVs, PCs, Tablets. Do you know how many terabytes and broadband consuptions have Video servers ? And it is working no problem, Bitcoin to be useful for all  must go the same way as Internet and Internet providers on the market should operate small, middle and big players. Your idea is the same as you say everybody should use dial up line in Internet because for email it is good and we all no need broadband because we have TV, phones and mobile. In your world will be No Skype, Youtube, WatsUP, Facebook and tons others applications.

Ok. Thanks for the advice, I'll do it and I will not alone. You managed to destroy a great idea and Bitcoin mark. Never mind, in the world are a lot of interesting things that I can devote my energy than persuading fools. Have a nice day... :D

Luke-jr : Luke maybe you're a good programmer, with regard to the economy, you're an idiot. Nobody would have bought such a chip. Isn´t it simplest way to do concensus with Bitmaintech and make a version of client with SW + 2 .. 8 megabytes client? I supported Bitcoin since 2011, and now I've sold much of Bitcoins and if be no concensus I will sell the rest. Altcoins  BCC and BCU are not Bitcoin !!!

Ok you can buy miners farms and start mining, if you have problem with centralised mining.

Nonsense, I am afraid that transaction fee could kill Bitcoin

I am fan of this solutions. People around Core are extremists, this is bad for Bitcoin.

ASICBoost didn´t function on Stratum protocol i.e. on public pools.
@_date: 2017-04-10 08:35:11
I will start a minimum 3 new full nodes, when you make concensus i.e. SW + 2MB. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 15:58:04
I fully agree with NYA
@_date: 2017-09-13 12:23:12
Nobody care over JP Morgan CEO comments, but developers form Core don´t support 2x and rumors of China exchange ban. This are the real reasons of BTC price fall.

Shatoshi definition of Bitcoin...
The majority decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the largest proof-of-work effort invested in it. If the majority of CPU power is controlled by honest nodes, the honest chain will grow the fastest and outpace of any competing chains.
This means that the longer trusted chain that has the highest security defines what Bitcoin is.  NOT  Blockstream company (CORE), NOT Blockstream and NO2X Believers.

I am user and I WANT S2X . YES2X  !!!!!!!!!!!
@_date: 2017-09-20 15:47:11
I hope that 2x will be reality and 1 MB BTC will be listed on exchanges as CCC (Core cripple coin) ... :D
@_date: 2017-10-06 11:50:21
Well, It seems to be the majority of the infrastructure and the economy that give BTC value... What offer Core instead that higher fee a slower TX ? 
@_date: 2017-10-08 06:23:27
Conbase announcement is exactly according to Satoshi's definition of Bitcoin....
After the fork, we will allow access when we have determined each blockchain IS SECURE AND STABLE. We expect this to happen within a few days after the fork, but it may take longer if additional risks emerge ....

"...from the influence of charismatic dictators, even if their names are Luke-JR, Maxwell, Todd or Donald Trump...."

Well, I wish you another 5 years with Blockstream company (ie Core), full mempool, higher fee, slower transactions, tons of bullshits on sites, loosing marketcaps, stress, etc ...
It's time for altcoins, LTC, DASH Byteball, XMR ...  Charlie Lee has good reasons to support NO2X... By... : D

All NO2X people sell BT2 (SX2) token on Bitfinex, please.  Thank you... :D

Shatoshi white paper, what is real bitcoin...

Why Core does not implement S2X ? Simple solution...

Unlike Bitcoin, XRP has quick transfers and low fees. It works better for payments.

Well, I lost money in MtGox and now in btc-e. Thank you boys... :-(

If it were SW+2-8MB HF Bitcoin price would be at $5.000 by now.
@_date: 2016-05-24 22:20:24
Hold ETH has no sense, due to inflation model.

I am user of BTC since 2011 and I support SW2x. Everybody in BTC community that I know support SW2x and end this stupid War. LN with $30 fee for open channel is not good idea.
