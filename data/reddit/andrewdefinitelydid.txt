You never addressed anything, and accusing me of being the person who hacked you, is just a convenient way to dismiss what I'm saying instead of answering the questions.
The data in the S3 bucket is user wallet data, it's even explained in your Whitepaper that you keep user wallets private keys in an encrypted blob, and the S3 bucket was named... shock horror... "encrypted-user-blobs". As I said before, the fact this bucket was exposed in the first place is lax security on your behalf. You have no idea if it's decryptable. If this happened to Binance you would add it in that official public list of yours attacking any exchange that has a security breach.
Especially telling you refuse to deny that you work for Roger Ver, because it's the truth and you know it - and even Roger Ver would admit it.

Be careful of this platform, they previously had a leak of all account and user data. It was revealed during their public AMA along with several other lies, and they later covered it up.
The owner is a major Bitcoin Cash shill and actually worked for Roger Ver (Google this and verify it yourself) to build LocalBitcoinCash. He used to constantly talk on his chat groups (LocalEthereum and LocalBitcoinCash) about how Bitcoin has no future and would be overtaken by Bitcoin Cash.
Stick to HodlHodl, Bisq, and exchanges that can be trusted, rather than a dodgy exchange that just changed its name, headed by a guy who literally works for Roger Ver.

Nice try Michael

I'm not the person who exposed you in the AMA, so your accusations there are directed at the wrong person.
It's widely known you work for Roger Ver and built the Bitcoin Cash site. Searching through their Telegram reveals hundreds of messages from you (such as this one saying 0conf is safe and admitting to creating a vulnerability  regarding bugs and issues, where it's clear you are the only person developing the platform. LocalBitcoinCash is owned by Roger Ver, that means you work for him.... the logic isn't that complicated.
It doesn't matter how the keys are generated, the fact is that they are generated within your app, and users have no way of knowing the keys aren't sent to the backend after generation. Calling yourself non-custodial is a lie: you simply are not a non-custodial site. The trading is non-custodial once the escrow begins, but user wallets are in your hands.
As for the data breach, you admit yourself ALL of your user wallet data was downloaded off your servers by an attacker. A reputable company would announce this disclosure instead of trying to gloss over it. Whether they can decrypt it or not is unknown to you, because if your security expertise was that proficient you wouldn't have been hacked in the first place!
Whenever you face an accusation your response is to deflect it and then try to confuse readers with technical-speak. That's the strategy of Craig Wright, and he's not really liked around here either.

All user wallet data was hacked. Whether or not they can decrypt it you don't know. That's a breach...

Very telling in your response you completely gloss over the fact you work for Roger Ver, probably the biggest enemy of BTC. He literally pays your wage and you built his LocalBitcoinCash site. Your post history on Reddit contains a bunch of stuff bagging out BTC.
I was in the AMA and people told you they captured all of your user data from an open AWS  bucket. Other people called you out on your lies about not tracking people with Google by showing screenshots of your Google Analytics tags.
Then later you posted a recap of all the questions in your AMA. Everything was included, except conveniently the questions exposing your data breach and lies about tracking users.
So given all this you expect people to trust you are non-custodial? Encryption keys generated in the browser is meaningless because you could easily send these to yourself or generate them in an insecure way. That 100% requires trust.
HodlHodl is non-custodial and trustless, your site relies on us to take you at your word that our funds are safe when we send them to the addresses you provide us. Given that you work for Roger Ver it is basically impossible to trust you

That website is a dubious site that has been breached, and this guy is just the owner promoting it. Use HodlHodl or Bisq instead.

LocalcoinSwap is also custodial, just like your site.
The only truly non-custodial sites for Bitcoin are:
Trying to claim your site is non-custodial is just straight out scamming

No, Bitcoin addresses are checksummed precisely to stop this happening

Any shipping options to Eastern Europe?

Scary title, but everything was ok after reading. Lost Bitcoins should not be recoverable, that's a Bcash and Shitcoin-vision thing

All my points are well founded and you refuse to answer them, such as your association with Roger Ver.
@_date: 2019-12-01 09:02:44
LocalCryptos had a data breach where all user data was leaked, it's not a safe place to trade

Never been to Japan but planning a trip there sometime. How Bitcoin-friendly is the country?
@_date: 2019-12-02 03:51:03
It's public knowledge just like your relationship with Roger Ver
@_date: 2019-12-01 09:01:50
He's not only an ETH guy and proven liar, he's also a direct employee of Roger Ver and built the Bitcoin Cash LBC imitation. You can verify this on Telegram

Proof this had anything to do with the collapse of the Canadian exchange?
Not calling you out, just want to see the evidence as I haven't seen this association claimed before

Amazing work!
One thing I want to clarify is this function here in the code:
This looks like that legacy Ethereum signing format where you prepare signatures with a prefix for elliptic curve public key recovery, being reused in Bitcoin. What is this needed for? Ethereum moved away from this standard because it wasn't developer friendly - why is Electrum recreating this in BTC?
Also, I couldn't help but notice a lot of similarities in the codebase to Vitaliks work. It just looks like his style of Python programming. Was he an influence in this, or is any of the code his work?
Overall looks solid and like you put a lot of effort into this. I will be using it. Thanks!
