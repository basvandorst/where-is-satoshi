....Given the fact that the prospect of a regulatory policy for a bitcoin exchange isn’t clear yet and to ensure that the majority of users use our Wallet function like always, we have, after deliberation, reluctantly decided to remote the Exchange from our Wallet and have ceased RMB deposits.
Additional details reveal HaoBTC’s exchange will cease to exist at 14:00 local time on February 15, with any open orders at the time canceled automatically. RMB deposits will close on February 17, at the same time.

Hey, keep in mind:
1) that SOME people think it will be approved... Therefore, they are pouring $ into 'cheap' coins, and pushing the price upwards...      
2)After 3+ yrs of work, lawyer fees and bitcoin-holding, the Wink-twins are not going to just walk away.. they will resubmit, even if the other two come first. 
When the time comes, and if a rejection happens, I expect that there may be a 10-20% drop, as people try some manipulation..but in reality everyone is holding because there are two more ETFs coming. 
By the way...  I fully expect coins to have been pumped up to at least $1300-$1350 (usd) by the days before the ETF decision, because even traders will take the opportunity to pump&amp;dump...  so a fall of 10-20% from there  brings us back to where we are now anyway...with two more ETFs to ride us up again.
I'd say that if you have any belief in bitcoin, now's a pretty safe bet to put some money in, even if you plan to pull it out days before March 8th..  (1st ETF).

In essence, a bot will just automate tasks.. there are a lot of stratagy's out there that people write a bot for, and a lot more that will then try to 'game' that bot and manipulate it, knowing it reacts to certain rulesets..  
In the long run, either learn how to trade manually and write your own to do the heavy lifting, or just buy and hold... which for all but the lucky few ends up being a better long-term approach.

I'm looking forward to it..   
For those of you who don't remember, last time this happened, this was when America was still cleaning up the 2008 banking mess, doing lots of QE, and yet America almost ground to a halt as government employees were almost forced to take unpaid leaves because until they raised the borrowing limit, the gov't couldn't afford to pay salaries...     
Repub vs. Democrats became a pissing match for concessions, and the issue was kicked down road till march 2017 in order to get the government moving again.. 
Now it's 2017, the world's banks are still shaky, the economies have not really recovered, and Trump wants to Make America Great Again...  And he's going to be forced to basically raise the ceiling and spend lots more money... on walls and stuff...  and running the government without raising taxes, etc.. 
The results will be glorious...    If the market doesn't crash due to the debt limit (extending your own line of credit basically) , and America can sell enough treasury bonds to other countries to keep funding this mess, then it will be another great 4 years.. 
I can't wait.
(ps.  the /s is implied.. .Buy bitcoin..or gold..or silver.. or another currency.. because even if the ETF doesn't pass, you need to secure your wealth, and the USD$ isn't going to be your safe-haven for the near future.)

Thanks for the post, I gave you an upvote:
However, they lost me at this bullshits quote below: 
“Furthermore, the SEC appears to also be evaluating the risk that ownership of bitcoin could, theoretically, be changed by a coordination of a majority of the network’s hashing rate”.
"We think the risk of a change in ownership from a coordination of a majority of the network’s hashrate is a known risk that is reflected in the market price of bitcoin."
They show a fundamental misunderstanding, as it specifically talks about how 'Hash' can affect the security of previously issued bitcoins, which can only be affected via private keys...   They are mixing concepts of how hash &amp; difficulty works, and how private keys and sha256 is used in the relation to private keys.  No increase or decrease in 'Hash'  will cause a "change in ownership" in your private keys... 
They're really speaking of a coordinated 51 % attack  (Chinese fears / BU fears? )-- which would either cause a soft/hard fork going forward on the strongest chain for future coins, or attempts at reversing transactions.    There are many millions of dollars 'lying around' that could have 'changed ownership' already when 'hash' was small and attacks 'easier' that never occurred.  Satoshi's coins would be a prime example..   Never moved, never stolen, not by any attack... Bitcoin is secure.  Your 'ownership' is secure.
tl'dr - Dismantling Needhams Bullshit attempts at influencing the bitcoin marketplace.

SnapChat has a market cap of almost 30 Billion dollars, and they basically do fuck all..  
"We began commercial operations in 2011 and for all of our history we have experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operations," Snap said in its regulatory filing with the SEC. "If our revenue does not grow at a greater rate than our expenses, we will not be able to achieve and maintain profitability."
WTF?   How can COIN compete with this kind of stuff??.. I can't even make it up.
HODL.    Bitcoin is like owing a piece of a financial network...  That's got to be worth more than Snapchat.

Naaah..  
If it hits $10,000   We celebrate.
If it hits $100, We hold for 3 more yrs, and BUY BUY BUY..
Either way, I have a bottle of Ron Zacapa 23 set aside to celebrate, and an equal amount in BTC on leverage....   I'll party and either drink my winning or my losses.. and buy more on Tuesday regardless..    Win / Win

After watching the government grind to a halt in 2007,  (We can't afford to pay our employees unless we raise the debt ceiling and borrow more money for basic government operations..) be fought tooth and nail by the different administrations as a tool for their own needs,  we had the financial crash of 2008, Quantitive easing 1, 2, 3 and 4..      An interest rate increase is expected, and the debt ceiling will remind every citizen that they're essentially borrowing more money from their child's future, with lots of $,000,000,000,000 zeros..   Hey, ONE trillion is (1,000,000,000,000 Dollars,, and they already doubled the debt on TOP of QE 1-4...    
 
This will absolutely affect anybody smart enough to do the research.

Hey, Question for anyone who's done research on SEC decisions..     This COIN ETF has had a LOT of public comments submitted since it's original submission..    Are there ANY other ETF's in the past that have had this many public comments submitted?

Yet one more vote for QuadrigaCX.  They do interac transfer and more, and are quite responsive.  I also have left BTC and Fiat in there with no concerns, although if your uncle isn't trading I'd still advise he withdraw to a wallet, simply on principle.... show him how to manage and teach him how to secure it..   
BTC is still an experiment, but on all accounts, a successful one..    Still, only invest what you (he) can afford to lose.
