Better to ask r/BitcoinMining

You know you’ve hit the floor when there’s a strong bounce followed with high volume.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:19:33
This is so relatable. I genuinely had to unfollow them when they just kept spouting out old and let’s be honest, incorrect news. 
But the comment section was hilarious to read, so many misinformed people! ��
Edit: not as bad as the BBC News comment section.. that’s awful to read.

Don't be an Alfie.
@_date: 2017-08-11 20:12:28
Haha wow. Alfie is very stereotypical and plain stupid. You'll be the one smiling in a couple years ����

Just commit to buying now because it's never too late to buy bitcoin. You will make a profit when holding for long term.
You will never be able to buy at the right moment, it's nearly impossible.

This is creating a Paradox.
@_date: 2017-10-24 22:01:11
Think you meant support?

$3000 is right around the corner.. didn't expect to say that today
@_date: 2017-07-16 22:41:12
Useful comment! Thanks for that, exactly what I was hoping for..
@_date: 2017-07-16 22:42:42
Yeah, $1800 seems to be showing a good level of support.
@_date: 2017-07-27 09:18:42
Either way, it's your decision.
@_date: 2017-07-16 23:37:01
We are both in the same boat, I bought a few at $2400 and planning to buy some more in the upcoming days.
@_date: 2017-07-16 23:30:02
Hold and be patient ��
@_date: 2017-07-23 22:53:22
@_date: 2017-07-12 09:06:30
I think I'm gonna wait a couple days before buying again because I feel that we might see $2k first before $3k - possibly a leg up to $2400-$2500 then a decline as August 1st comes closer?
@_date: 2017-07-15 16:49:23
I will definitely be buying at $1600
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:42:24
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:12:01
It's here..
@_date: 2017-07-12 09:26:37
I think it's a high possibility during August time; only if there is no hard fork/blockchain split.
@_date: 2017-07-25 10:43:52
Ermm no? ��
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:00:58
I KNOW! I've made some crazy gains. It's 12:00am GMT and I can't go to bed when bitcoin is acting like this aha
@_date: 2017-07-15 14:20:33
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:02:34
@_date: 2017-07-27 21:54:48
How do you know this? ��
@_date: 2017-07-16 07:32:34
I'm buying if the price reaches $1600
@_date: 2017-07-12 16:34:40
That's what I've done. Good luck to everyone ����
@_date: 2017-07-27 09:07:19
Or you can buy now and then buy again on Saturday.
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:11:00
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:29:24
It was scary I must say
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:10:00
Yeah I'm exactly the same :/ looks like $2900 is about to be breached.. bloody hell
@_date: 2017-07-16 07:42:38
True. I'm in here for the long haul so a $400-$600 difference doesn't matter too much for me.
