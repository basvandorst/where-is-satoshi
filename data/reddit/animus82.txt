I believe without Mt. Gox manipulation we are starting to see BTC return to it's correct. Intrinsic value.  Assets like this can easily be manipulated with enough money and the correct computer algorithm.
But don't fear.  When the price is like 100-200$, wall street will start pushing it past $1000.  Before they leave holding the bag again.

LOL, now I can send that Nigerian prince bitcoins instead of the information to my bank accounts.
Thanks Bitcoin.
A lot of white boys are going to be sending a lot of internet brides (African Dudes) a lot of bitcoin soon.

Good luck closing the short.  There are more scams then just Ponzis.
@_date: 2014-03-27 18:23:59
Fundamental analysis?  Should I look up BTC price to earnings Ratio?  Their debt to equity.
The price is manipulated by big players and the markets, similar to gold.

Keep holding the bag.
I'll buy some at 100~ to make up my losses.

Man, it's like you guys have never heard of live to fight another day.
Take it out of BTC, put it in a more secure ETF that gives you 5-6%, maybe a bit in like a growth stock.
Call it good.  
Diversification is key.  Don't act tough like me, like I did with gold.  I bought gold at 90 and then it went to 180 and I bought more at 169.  Finally sold it at 127, after 5 fucking years of currency inflation, only to realize that wall street and the British manipulated the price.

Maybe he wants my Pogs or my 1990's comics.  I'm sure those have all gone up in value as well.

All they have to do is do what china did.
Ban banks (which are controlled and regulated by the gov) from dealing with bitcoin companies.  And then its over.
@_date: 2014-09-09 16:11:27
LOL, you guys are such bad investors.  
3 whole quarters of the price going down and you guys bail??
That's so cute.  You guys should never ever get involved in the stock market.  Keep your money under your mattress.
I remember when I was your guys age and soo impatient.  Seems like a life time ago.
@_date: 2014-10-02 17:38:15
That's what I said about gold.
For years it has been manipulated in London with no signs of stopping.  The rich have complete control and have gamed the gold market.  Why not silver as well?
@_date: 2014-03-27 23:45:30
Are you out of your mind?  Without easy FIAT conversion what is the point of BTC?
@_date: 2014-03-28 16:24:12
Price fluctuates too much and what does Valve gain?  Sure they save 3% from CC fees and/or Paypal but why bother when they already take a 30% cut for "distribution".
@_date: 2014-04-02 17:24:41
China bullshitted the price of the asset up.  You see when the Chinese can run their own exchange, of course they are going to put in Yuan, have the BTC price rise up.  Exchange it for dollars.
Now that they can't, the aggregate BTC to USD amount is going  down without China to artificially keep the mean price of BTC up with their bull crap exchanges.
@_date: 2014-04-09 15:23:45
...10$?  20$.  This is BTCs equivalent of hover handing.
Go deep with at least 10-12 BTC, $5000 or more. 
Forget a taste, take a bite for once in your lives.
@_date: 2014-03-27 18:44:25
I just panicked sold.  Forget this crap.
I just wanted the price the stay stable.
It's going back to 100.  I blame Mt. gox for the bull crap rising of prices.
@_date: 2014-03-27 23:32:50
Do you know what happens when a guy like you tries to catch a falling knife?
....its not good.
@_date: 2014-03-27 23:01:17
What the ever loving heck are you going on about.
In what world, does losing 15% of anything in a DAY! Currency or Asset, not matter?  
@_date: 2014-10-22 22:10:34
Thanks for posting this.  I will be using this service for sure for remittance in the future.  I'm not here for investment purposes like some of you.  I actually want to use it to send money to my family in Canada and to make purchases.
All store should start using this service to strengthen the bit coin market rather then instantly changing btc to fiat like they have been doing.
@_date: 2014-03-28 03:31:04
You let banks screw you over.
Banks work for me and for free.
You are in fact.  A loser.
@_date: 2014-03-27 23:16:56
I made over 200% on Facebook when at first I was down 70%.  
You guys no nothing about investing or me.
I'm having fun goading you guys.  
What is ACB also?  Account balance?
@_date: 2014-03-25 20:26:42
Say genius.
Were the Mt. Gox bitcoins taken out of circulation?  Oh what's that?  They weren't?  Assuming the rightful owners don't immediately sell like scared children the effect will either be neutral or positive when it comes to the price.  Stay in school.
@_date: 2014-10-04 23:36:18
LOL 2K..... get real.  Try 50K
@_date: 2014-03-27 23:11:28
$500 and falling,
GET READY FOR THE ROLLER COASTER!!
LOOK OUT BELOW!!!  
You had your chance fools,  the Bears eat, the Bulls eat, the PIGS (you guys) always get slaughtered.  I lost 30-40% but I ain't goin down with the ship.
@_date: 2014-03-30 17:25:36
........................    :0  
You guys need to layoff the pipe.  Seriously
@_date: 2014-03-25 18:04:15
The price will go up if this is true.
More BTC in the hands of more people trading it.
Also, it improves BTC reputation and peoples trust. 
Trust is important in any market.  
@_date: 2014-03-27 23:22:50
Maybe the news from CHINA is ... true?
Do you really trust their government?  Do you trust their "media"?
Really guys?  Come on now.  
@_date: 2014-04-11 16:08:18
It's not a currency, it is an asset. 
If you want the rest of the world to treat it as a currency it needs to be more stable or pegged to something else like the USD price of gold.
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:14:36
...WHAT THE every  loving FUCK you guys?  Why would you do this....  Do not invest money you can't afford to lose.  NEVER.
