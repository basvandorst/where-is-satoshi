Your points 1 and 2 are entirely correct.  The 10k USD limit shows up all over the place. I have had transactions between banks in the same county flagged. And good luck with a transaction coming from a country that the US has sanctions against if it is over $10k.
Banks are built around the idea of minimizing risk, and anything that even has a hint of “suspicious” will get flagged in my experience.

The phrase “negative interest rates” should be a giant red flag to everyone into the world.
I understand that central banks could argue it is because corporations are sitting on massive piles of cash and the banks somehow think “negative interest rates” will force the corporations to spend money.  But really, the corporation with $100 million in the bank is not going to care if they are at -0.02% interest and probably have all sorts of ways to protect their bottom line.  The seniors who have their life savings in a bank account and are facing inflation and negative interest rates *should* care a lot.

$100? No idea. I could make some wild guesses but honestly that sounds excessive for that amount.

Move it to a wallet. If you are new look up software based ones until you get a feel for how it works. Then migrate to a hardware (I.e. Trezor) once you are comfortable with the idea and want more security.
Once you have your BTC in a wallet, you can send/receive around using the Wallet.  Most people will use multiple sources for buying (I.e. big exchange like Coinbase, Cashapp, etc.) but store their money in an unaffiliated wallet for safety.
Just do your research on wallets and make sure you pick one that has a comfortable level of security and features for you.

Wait...did they have credibility to start with?

I am all in favor of this, I definitely know people who think they have to buy a “whole coin” and are intimidated by the price and how much it fluctuates.
Or maybe better marketing that you don’t need a whole “coin” to get started.

I just tested this a couple days ago, click the “Other Bank” option then manually enter your information. Never go through the easy click buttons. Even if your bank is listed there you can choose “Other Bank.”
Also, many banks through online banking will let you create a “burner” checking account.  Use one of those for your transactions so the information you give to the Exchange is for a new account not tied to useful things (like bill autopay, direct deposits, etc.)

Yeah, poor choice of words on my behalf.  I should have written, “Banks are built around the perception of minimizing risk”. You are 100% correct, the shady crap they have done historically shows otherwise.

One of the most insightful comments I ever heard was from my grandfather, who said, “People don’t trust weather forecasters, who make statements based on science that includes a fair amount of guess work, but they will believe economists, who are trying to guess what groups of irrational people will do in herds.”

AFAIK they hold it for 2-3 days for wire transfers.  You can transfer it around within their website, but it will be “unavailable” if you try to send to a wallet outside Coinbase.

I looked at Kraken because it has so many positive recommendations, but using it and the fees associated with getting fiat into it makes it completely unusable where I live. The Crypto exchanges definitely require a lot of research before using any particular one.

Seems to depend.  My brother went through full verification in about 30 minutes for CashApp.  I started mine at the same time 3 weeks ago and any attempts at customer service have vanished into a black hole.
I suggest checking out Dropbit for wallet and BTC purchase options. I believe it goes through Coinify and you can use a credit card for purchases under $500.  Fees are ludicrously high by the time you are done, but setup is about 5 minutes and it worked without any issues. At least that is what a coworker told me when he tried it, I have not used it myself.

Assuming you are in the US (if not, ignore this).
Download Cash.App on your phone.  Link your checking account and go through the “Enable Deposits and Withdrawals” setup.  Have your friend send you the BTC to your Cash.App account (there will be a wallet where you can receive BTC), then you can directly “Cash Out” to your account.
If the automated system works it will take about an hour (or less) to get everything setup.
