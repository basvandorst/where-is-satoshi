Freewallet is massively dangerous, they control your keys so when you use it you're really just giving them your bitcoin and hoping that they won't exit scam you.

Some really interesting background to the history and properties of monetary systems from my favourite economist prof. Steve Keen.
This kind of well thought out approach to analysing bitcoin as a monetary system serves as a great starting point.

See this comment to get an understanding of how wrong you are:

Check out the work of economist Steve Keen, it shows that South Korea's economy is in a debt fueled bubble.
Private debt is 190% of GDP and credit (the rate of the increase in debt) is 10%.
At these levels even a small reduction in credit will see the economy begin to slow and head towards recession.
Or it will go like the US did in 2008 and implode.
Smart money leaving the currency.

The creation of debt through double entry book keeping in a fractional reserve system has been the fuel of economic growth in much of the world since the 1980s
Just check out this table to understand how borrowing has financed decades of economic activity:

Private debt also includes the business sector, so household debt is certainly 90% of GDP and private businesses hold debt of another 100% of GDP.
I would strongly suggest you check out Steve Keen's work and prepare yourself for a likely economic collapse.

I mean it as honest advice, not at all as a negative comment on Korea. These debt bubbles are part of capitalism across the globe and certainly Keen has an excellent presentation in his book.
Having gone through a debt based collapse in my country, i wish i could have prepared (sold inflated assets to buy crypto-currency &amp; other currencies) but i didn't understand the nature of the problem.
The US and UK are now in the state of having large debts but very low levels of credit, so little new debt creation and little debt being paid back. They are debt zombies in the same position Japan has been in since the crash there in 1991 where economic growth cannot take place because growth is destroyed by paying back debts.
Just take this as the call of someone who has fallen off a hidden cliff and is shouting out to others to warn them it's there.
