Yeah, it is really small. My lawyer charges $350(+, at his discretion) an hour. To hire him as the middleman to see this bet through would actually cost more than the bet itself. Same reason I'm not suing Mintpal/Moolah over the 2k USD worth of Dogecoin I had held there just for lolz. Not really worth it in the end when dealing with such small amounts.

Yes! Basically a bitcoin preacher, right?

Because it's bitcoin or banks, you have to choose one

Nope. See my comment here: 
Let me know when there's a real bet with real stakes that will make me more than putting that same amount of money into shorting. Thanks.

Please do not put-down genuine requests for information regarding Bitcoin, the *currency of the Internet*. It's a distributed, worldwide, decentralized digital money. Unlike traditional currencies such as dollars, bitcoins are issued and managed without any central authority whatsoever: there is no government, company, or bank in charge of Bitcoin. As such, it is more resistant to wild inflation and corrupt banks. With Bitcoin, *you can be your own bank*.

Unfortunately they are related, yes.

When I close my eyes I hear my son Kyle's voice.. at first I thought he was saying "mom," but now I realize he was whispering "moon!"

Totally justified--and yes, I'm talking about the green and red lines. Are you even serious? Anyone can see due to this Christmas coloring that the vertex of both tangents are incremental... I don't have to walk you through this, do I? The tech-trader's buy/sell flags are clear, the kine formula is showing obvious distress under such a moontheto quantum lyric. I try not to get too absolute with these graphs but it's clear the price is heading upward, and quickly. After two whole weeks especially, the noise of P/D fits accordingly. If you have any questions please feel free to ask. I don't accept changetips but thank you anyways. - Kyle's Mother

Oh CLASSIC Skitsenelli's Rebound Vertical Tripe with a hint of backtrodden Code4 lengonight.
Basically this technical analysis relying on an arbitrary time frame displays evidence of an exponential growth taking off soon. Absolutely explosive. (49 pounds worth)

Maybe in and if I hypothetically did that then I would've hypothetically already received over 15 bits, most of which I will hodl. How could you be mad about that?
@_date: 2014-12-30 08:20:53
Yes, see my comment here:

You just wrote about how other people are stupid using a post title that starts off "I can't think of a good title"

If 49 pounds of fireworks are not particularly dangerous, I'm very curious to know what meets your criteria of dangerous? 
49 pounds of fireworks would not endanger other people? You have flawless logic which causes me to trust the things you vouch for, namely Bit-Coins! 
P.S. You are very creepy.

bitfinex. shorting is scary, especially with stocks. not with penny stocks or doomed crypto currencies. up your bet tenfold, i will take it.
