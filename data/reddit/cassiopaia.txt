i've noticed a canceled order with reason --&gt; Market price protection .. what does this mean? Could you explain!? And why it needs 6000 Confirmations to be able to trade? 
@_date: 2015-08-07 14:43:24
Thx for your prompt explanation.. well appreciated! I'll wait ... 
@_date: 2015-08-08 09:54:32
i intend to agree here! 
@_date: 2015-08-07 14:17:16
thx for you explanation, got it ! So if i don't have any other collateral .. i have to wait ?... but wouldn't it be fair, if all users would get same chances to deposit and trade ..? Currently i'm traveling so i can't access my cold storage ...
