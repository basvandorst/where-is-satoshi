Very interesting observation. Can you also fit the loglog periodicity of the peaks? I am not aware of statistical models with power law plus periodicity, while simple power laws are very well known in the field of critical phenomena.

Bitcoin needs a hard fork to switch to post quantum cryptography. And after some time it would not be secure to move funds from old addresses, even if never used. [This post]( is an interesting read. ECDSA is to be considered insecure if the time horizon is 17 years.
@_date: 2019-03-21 08:31:22
It is especially important if one plans to keep funds on an address for more than 10 years (2030), which is one of the most common estimates for powerful enough quantum computers, that can extract the private key from the ECDSA public key.
Unfortunately, around 36% bitcoins are on exposed public keys.
Edit: the public key (in the example, the one starting with 04) is exposed only when you spend. The hashed public key (the address) is much more secure, even from powerful quantum computers, provided you never spend...
@_date: 2018-10-06 16:27:11
For this reason, many supposedly Satoshi's bitcoins published their public key, so they will be the first juicy target once quantum computers will be sufficiently powerful.

Your suggestion of 50 years for powerful quantum computers is based on experience in the field or is it a bet? People in the field estimate 2030 for breaking ECDSA and RSA (there can be marketing in that, I admit). Also the NIST is already in the phase of evaluating post-quantum signature schemes. Iirc they should finish in 2025.

Ok, I thought about it (I am a bit slow). I would say the problem is not to change address from addresses that did not show their public key yet. The problem is th 36% bitcoins which already are on exposed public keys. They should move *now* to safe addresses, which do not test exist on the bitcoin blockchain,  or at least move *now* to addresses which have not yet exposed public keys.

Inflation has two different but related meanings. One is A increase of monetary base, the second is B increase in the average prices (weighted somehow). 
You are implying A=B which is simply not true. There is a likely implication A=&gt;B , which however depends on the vitality of economy and wages, and in any case takes some (months?years?) time. An example of this is the Eurozone, where A has been implemented by the central bank for a few years, but B has been practically absent.

Sure, governments are already moving to PQ encryption, at least this is what the NIST suggests. For example, one should not use RSA to encrypt very sensitive data which is accessible, but AES. It is reasonable to assume that very sensitive encrypted data are being stored now by adversarial agencies and will be decrypted in a few decades. 
@_date: 2018-10-28 15:38:09
A few cryptocurrencies already implemented post-quantum signature schemes and transaction size is around 2kb. The rationale of switching to a post-quantum signature scheme now is that for existing blockchains there will be a problem concerning already published public keys. For example, in summer 2018, 36% of bitcoins were on exposed public keys. Also Satoshi's coins are on exposed public keys. Who will transition them to new secure addresses?

There already are quantum circuits with 50 qubits. I agree that no one can reliably extrapolate those numbers to the thousands of error corrected qubits that would be needed for Shor algorithm, however I would not underestimate the amount of research that is being put in this sector. First results are already there in the field of quantum chemistry and optimization. Moreover quantum simulators are already used, and there are proposals to use those also for speeding up brute force prime numbers factorization.
@_date: 2018-10-06 16:44:18
Shor algorithm will solve the integer factorization problem in a polynomial time. NIST is already planning to deprecate ECDSA and looking for post quantum signature and encryption schemes. [Here is an interesting read](
@_date: 2018-06-21 16:22:57
Post quantum cryptography is an active field of research and the NIST has started the process to set the standard which will supersede RSA and DSA. So banks and websites will probably change cryptography schemes in time. For cryptos, being decentralized, changing the standard may be a problem, in particular for addresses that already have published the public key.
@_date: 2018-06-21 16:18:27
Nice article about IOTA. I would mention also QRL, which is a standard blockchain and is launching its mainnet soon, having concluded an audit by red4sec.
@_date: 2019-06-18 07:03:20
While I wholeheartedly agree with your first sentence, I find that the first an the last sentence of your comment are contradictory. Meaning that, either bitcoin introduces postquantum signatures much earlier than powerful QC are real, and all owners (included those who are dead...) move their coins to new addresses, or it will never be fully quantum resistant.
The point is, who will move coins whose keys are lost? There is an estimate of around 20% of the supply. If those are moved by a QC this does not bode well for the other coins supposedly moved to new quantum resistant addresses.
@_date: 2019-06-18 05:49:06
Why one time? Whenever an ECDSA key is revealed, a powerful quantum computer will be able to derive the private key. For very reach addresses, one could even imagine man in the middle attacks to delay legitimate transactions and give time to a QC to derive the key once it has been relayed to the network before it enters a block.
I agree this is years away, but I would not bet it us decades away. 
And keep in mind that around 1/3 of tge  supply is currently on exposed public keys.
@_date: 2019-06-18 06:57:54
That would be quite wonderful to witness. Provided Satoshi doxxed themselves publicly by signing also a message with their name...
@_date: 2019-06-18 09:24:57
So how do quantum computers work? I am not talking of Grover search algorithm, but Shor's algorithm for prime factoring and discrete logarithm. 
For example, recently this paper  estimated that estimated that roughly 20M noisy qubits would be sufficient for breaking RSA2048 in a few hours. 
Of course the point is when such machine will be built.
Regarding evolution of bitcoin, again, I am not speaking of a better PoW which is only partially affected by Grover and is trivial to update, but about the signature scheme and the users that cannot move their coins to new postquantum addresses (that, we all agree, will be introduced at some point)
@_date: 2019-06-14 22:03:56
For small amounts I guess this is feasible. For large amounts one should consider that as soon as you forge your transaction and send it to a node, the public key is revealed. In principle a fast quantum attacker could derive the public key and forge another transaction with higher fee. Whether this is feasible in 10 minutes depends on the speed of the QC. To be even more paranoid, there could be man in the middle attacks that intercept your public key before it is relayed to the network, increasing the time window for decryption.
@_date: 2019-06-05 11:45:09
Would you point me to a reference for ECC going to solve the problem? I understood RSA and ECDSA will be deprecated after the post-quantum NIST competition.
@_date: 2019-06-18 05:51:47
Yeah, that would really be a problem. Currently, hash-based signatures are considered safe (because Grover algorithm is still exponentially slow in the size), and lattice signatures are under investigation by the NIST (together with like 26 proposals)
@_date: 2019-06-13 18:08:38
I understand the order of priorities you lay out, however notice that all users will have to move their coins to new addresses. All means also Satoshi.
@_date: 2019-06-13 18:06:23
Suppose you hold for 15 years and then ECDSA proves unsecure due to quantum computers. What would you do?
@_date: 2019-06-17 19:05:33
At some point quantum computers will give the opportunity of freeing those locked coins, if ever their public key was revealed (via spending or due to P2PK). Satoshi's coins could be considered as a prize for the first powerful quantum computer.
@_date: 2019-06-18 05:59:40
There are two future milestones that I am watching with big interest: the first logical qubit (namely long lived thanks to the use of tens/hundreds of other auxiliary physical qubits for error correction) and quantum supremacy (namely the experimental demonstration of at least one algorithm that can run on QC much faster than on classical supercomputers).
The fact is that also quantum algorithms development is progressing fast. Recently, an optimized Shor algorithm has been devised which uses x100 less resources than previous estimates to break RSA2048 (still requires 20M qubits though)
@_date: 2019-06-15 20:30:18
The way I understand this issue, it's not a small part of the protocol. Asymmetric cryptography is the core of the way bitcoin works. 
When you create a wallet, you are reasonably sure that nobody can get your private keys, unless you save them in an improper way. With powerful quantum computers, you would know that somebody with simple public knowledge, as the public key of addresses that already spent coins, could derive your private keys. 
Then, no protocol change could protect your coins: you would have to personally move them, because only you and QC owners could move them.
The only case in which the devs could take care of the migration would be if they owned a QC! But then, how could they assign again the coins to you? That would not be bitcoin anymore...
So only coins that never revealed their pk, or for which there is some seed that only you know, can be saved via soft fork. At the moment these are only around 60% of bitcoin (source P Wuille).
@_date: 2019-02-28 06:03:24
About your last paragraph: this is indeed a big problem, for all blockchains that are not quantum resistant from the genesis block. So, unless you are reasonably convinced that powerful quantum computers are at least 50 years away, the time to discuss those things is not too early.
@_date: 2019-04-25 22:12:31
What of addresses of which the keys are lost? Foremost (probable) example: Satoshi's 1million coins? (in early implementation, the public key was not hashed)
@_date: 2019-04-25 10:18:05
It is true that hashing protects the public keys against future quantum computers. However, 36% bitcoin are on addresses that already published their public key 
@_date: 2019-06-18 07:05:44
Yeah, but there is also 20% bitcoin estimated to be on lost keys. Meaning that only QC will move them, nobody else could render them safe. I am wondering what happens to the value of the bitcoins on safe addresses when a successful quantum attack moves the others.

Once you have such a new empty address, and your old wallet, with all your bitcoin is blocked, how do you access your bitcoin? Please do not tell me that some magic fork will move automatically your bitcoin to such a new address without a signature of yours from the old address.
@_date: 2019-01-15 13:56:25
Cannot now. But if you plan to buy bitcoin and forget about it for a decade, you should really investigate more than in the linked article. Predictions about gate-based quantum computers speculate a powerful enough QC to break ECDSA will be available during the decade 2027-2037. The NIST is already studying a post-quantum standard (will be available in 2023). This is the typical issue when relying on developers and the node maintainers is not enough, because all users would have to move their funds to new types of addresses (being bitcoin and not a bank, the point is that it is really you who have to move your funds).
@_date: 2019-01-15 17:17:59
That would be much easier to patch. Hard fork to new hashing algorithm with doubled bit security (unless something faster than Grover is invented in the meantime). The first problem is Shor algorithm, that can extract private ECDSA key from the public one. This requires _all_ users moving their funds to a new address.
@_date: 2019-01-16 23:51:09
The Shor's algorithm page on wikipedia is a starting point. Many "periods" are evaluated at the same time, thanks to quantum superposition, but in the end you get a single answer. It's not that you classically attempt many different factorizations (which would take zillion of years). Notice also that today quantum computers still require repetition of many runs, because qubits are noisy, however the final objective is to have logical qubits, for which Shor algorithm would give the answer in one shot.
@_date: 2019-01-17 00:01:23
Indeed there are proposals for a quantum blockchain. But it won't be for the masses, like quantum computers at the beginning. Anyway post-quantum classical cryptography already exists, and even blockchains implementing it. (Not easy to switch to it later)

This article  estimates that a quantum computer could break an ECDSA signature in less than 10 min between 2027 and 2037. The strong assumption, in my opinion, is that size of quantum computers will increase exponentially, however that is a very interesting and reasoned analysis.

Satoshi's coins *do* have their public key revealed, because in the first bitcoin implementation the address _was_ the public key. It was not hashed until 2011 or 2012, I do not remember. So they are the most important target.
@_date: 2019-01-15 17:31:11
The problem is not exhausting all possible addresses and look for bitcoins in there. The problem is: knowing an address with an interesting amount of bitcoins in there, let us find its private key (or seed words). 
There are two possibilities. 1) the address (which is an hash of the public key) has already directly manifested its public key, due to spending of funds for example: then Shor algorithm would be able to derive the private key. 2) the address has never published its public key: this is secure from Shor, however one could use Grover (the same that would be used for a 51% attack) to extract the public key from the address and then Shor to extract the private key.
Keep in mind however that Grover algorithm is not exponentially faster than what can runclassical computers, so this is a much much further risk than Shor (which is theoretically exponentially faster than known classical counterparts)
@_date: 2019-01-15 22:46:09
Regarding real world quantum events, we are already there, only that they are small events. Quantum computers have been used to calculate the electronic energy of diatomic molecules,  or to evaluate some properties of magnetic lattices. Calculations that could be done also by classical computers, but the point is that around 100-150 qubits we could make calculations that are useful for material science. Those numbers should not be very far.

What I understood in reading your post is that you are mixing mining and deriving private keys. Two different quantum algos would be used to tackle those problems. Grover for mining, Shor for inverting ECDSA. In the former case it is true that the computational overhead would still be very large for the first powerful QC. In the latter case it is an on/off thing: once they are able to manage many (like millions) of qubits, the extraction of a private key will take minutes.
