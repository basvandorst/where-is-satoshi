Tenx appears to require you to give them your coins before they will let you sell them your coins so you can purchase things with fiat through a Visa card. If you have your coins in your own wallet, ie you have your coins, then you can't spend them without scale AND availability improvements of Bitcoin.

An average of two weeks but it could be as long as four weeks if the difficulty changed right before the miners stopped. The following difficulty change would also be after more than two weeks.

@_date: 2017-02-01 21:42:30
[The original schedule was around 140 years to mint all the coins at 2 weeks per difficulty change.]( That puts 1 satoshi scheduled around 136 years after the start. That can change, anything from a long term increase or decrease in mining rate to a fundamental change to the minting structure of bitcoin would drastically change or stop the onset of 1 satoshi created per block. Although the fees collected with most blocks are significantly larger than 1 satoshi block. By most blocks I am referring to some miners that are occasionally foregoing transaction verification in blocks to speed block mining, it's a close to cheating as you can get while still following the rules when mining :(.

[This chart of blocks mined in Feburary.](
It was linked in the article and shows an average block size of 864 KB per block mined by antpool and a total number mined of 768. That's 135 KB of unused space per block for 768 blocks. That works out to 103 MB, which is [larger than the current mempool backlog]( The current backlog would only take ~90 KB per block they didn't fill during last month.

It's a doom and gloom remark.
You are right about the fee rate per byte consumed in a block. They are the result of transaction scarcity; no one is going to allow this continue regardless of short term profits.
These larger fees are a serious hindrance to Bitcoin growth, which will have a larger impact on miner rewards. If segwit isn't activated another implementation that allows more transactions per block will be activated. Bitcoin must allow more transactions to survive.
As a side note this increase in transactions will provide more fees to the miners. They will be smaller fees though. But that's an appeal of Bitcoin, low transaction fees.
@_date: 2017-03-25 01:34:16
~~They are a step in that direction but are meaningless without meeting the activation requirements.~~

You would need at least three times as much solar but probably something like 5 times as much solar. Solar is much less useful at higher latitudes and during the shorter days of the year. Batteries will ruin the electricity costs and make you pay several times the price of grid power for most of the modern world. You might make it a little more cost effective to shut down your miners on days when it's not sunny to reduce the size of the batteries required by a factor of three or more but it still won't save you any money over grid cost.

Somewhere between 250k S9i's and 400k S9i's; that's at 3.5 to 5.5 EH/s. The amount will decrease if you leave your attacking hardware on long enough as it will drop the profitability and thus the overall hashrate.

That's specious. Refrigeration can move more heat than the energy used to move it. It is used to heat in some places where electricity is the only heating option. It can move much more heat from outside than would be created by directly converting electricity heat. Just to note resistive heating is 100% efficient so any improvement over that is technically over 100% efficient.

Refrigeration is over 100% efficient, that COP of 2 is very conservative. Liquid to liquid COP can be 7 in modern systems. That said the energy required for a COP of 2 is half of the amount of energy moved.

@_date: 2017-10-21 14:52:47
1)Not paying taxes is breaking the law. Not paying taxes on Bitcoin is breaking the law on a public ledger.
2)The Fed doesn't tax anyone. Inflation has been very low for the past forty years. It was, on average, four times as high during the previous eighty years. Fiat isn't about holding value, it's purpose is to facilitate transactions. As such it has to be inflationary or hoarding will cause runaway deflation.

While the whitepaper explicitly mentions the eventual avoidance of inflation that doesn't preclude the possibility of perpetual minting as coins are lost unintentionally.

You won't ever get any amount of Bitcoin by trying to mine it without an ASIC. But altcoins are an option and one can usually trade them for bitcoins. I'm not sure where to point you but a few years ago I did something similar to heat my room during the winter so it's possible.

ASICBoost helps mines blocks without any transactions while requiring fewer calculations than a normal block.

I think the past occurrences have been a deliberate show of the limitations of Bitcoin in it's current state. As they are deliberate they will continue until whoever is doing this decides to stop or they run out of coins to pay the miner's fee for transactions.
You can get around this by increasing the transaction fee. Otherwise you will have to wait until the backlog clears up enough for your transaction to get through.

Yes but those are only when a block is mined shortly after the previous block was mined. ASICBoost reuses previous calculations, this results in nearly empty blocks long after the previous block was mined.

Currently **some** blocks are mined as empty due to pools not being able to download and check the previous block before another block is mined. A doubling of blocksize will more than double the time between a block being mined and the ability to mine a non-empty block as blocksize correlates exponentially with the time to verify a block.
