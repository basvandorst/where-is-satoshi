Not more silly to assume that those are spying on everybody in the world. We unfortunately live in such a silly world.  
Great post!    
The role of centralized exchanges is also an important part of the situation.
I just posted something similar:   
Though I assume the market is manipulated by financial giants like JP Morgan and the take over of the mining power would be a later stage when it gets cheaper.

Using only OKPay is not a solution for a p2p exchange. Checkout Bitsquare ( - that seems the right way to go.

Interesting how blind bitcoiners are regarding politics:

A few ideas for reasons of the price decline:

Maybe you can move a bit to other alternatives which are not that much in focus of the price manipulators like BTC? Ethereum would be my recommendation once its available for trade. Counterparty might be another tip?

Sit back and relax is one possibility. Trying to analyze if there might be a strategy behind that movement another:  
Satoshi was very aware of the political potential of Bitcoin. Many countries say very clear that they are willing to fight Bitcoin.  
So don't so naive to think all is just  the same as it was years ago and its just a result of speculation, psychology and markets.  
There exist no coincidences beside those in quantum physics. 
What seems chaos to us is just a result of missing information or inability to gather and process all information.

Step 5: Be glad to have back your USD/EUR/RUB and let the state steal your money with inflation and the next fin crash.

I can't believe they have not been accomplices with the mastercoin side. It's no hard to estimate the effect created when artificially valuate MSC 5 times more then BTC. But I agree that they have become victims, sitting on a lot of worthless MSC.

Yes that might be an incentive. But that much? And they cut them self much more from falling prices as they win form killing competitors.

Sure possible. If you believe that a a free unregulated market does not contain actors who are trying to influence in their direction.

All your arguments are valid and have been valid since years. Only merchant cash flow has increased by BitPay, but that is about 1 or 2% of tx volume.  
I just say if something is possible and if there are incentives it will happen.

Conspiracies are often that what will be written in wikipedia later: See Echelon, Bilderberg,....
To assume that there are people who don't like Bitcoin to be a success is not a conspiracy but a result of strategic thinking.

Yes PoS, even flawed in the current implementations might be a stronger protection then PoW. Hope Ethereum will be a new alternative with real new solutions.

It is not a rapid decline but a slow one. But what you mention might be another open risk.

its not an investment. its a donation model.

Reality is what you we make a reality. But seems more that most people are driven by mechanisms to a certain form of reality and assume that is something natural given. Culture is not nature. We are the masters of our life. And if you are not your own master another one play that role for you.
