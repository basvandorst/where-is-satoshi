I know everyone is amused by memes but this should be the highest upvoted on the front page

Try doing or learning something productive with your time instead of making terrible memes about personal choices other people made that dont affect your life

Way too much of this place has absolutely nothing to do with bitcoin and is just obvious instances of some group of humans attempting to feel superior to some barely different other group of humans
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:16:27
Not really a personal decision to clutter reddits with shit memes that are designed to build a false sense of superiority instead of discussing the actual topic

build a new internet
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:04:24
Im paying $65/month for 25mbps internet with comcast.  Which would go even higher if I wasnt also paying for their cable television.  I honestly dont give a fuck about whatever confusing special offers comcast is talking about on their website to new customers in some specific area that make it look like they arent ass raping people in a monopoly.

Such events were absolutely necessary and required for bitcoin to make any progress toward becoming widely adopted and successful.  It may be a bubble -- but this can also be part of a healthy progression.
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:19:22
There is a community wifi movement.  It is to collectively purchase comcast internet and television services en masse in order to be provided discounts.  If there is another option, nobody appears to be aware of it.
@_date: 2017-11-22 05:41:36
What they won't tell you is most likely those prices are part of a larger package.  IE - $40 for internet, if and only if, you are also paying something like $100+ for their TV, and some other amount of money for their landline phone service.  We inquired on just having Comcast internet multiple times, and each time we found that it was **more** expensive to just have Comcast internet than it is to have Comcast internet + Comcast cable TV.
Comcast is making an absolute killing:
In the three months that make up Q3 2017, Comcast’s cable communications operation pulled in $2.65 billion in income. Revenue was up 5.1%, even as the company lost 125,000 subscribers.
Those kinds of results are possible for cable companies because they have monopoly power over the majority of their customer base. The most recent data from the FCC shows that nearly 80% of Americans have no choice when it comes to high-speed internet providers; either put up with cable prices, speeds, and usage caps, or go back to the 1970s.

As for your link - for my zip code I will provide you the following data points:
1.  There is 1 residential cable internet provider
2.  It is Xfinity (Comcast)
3.  They have a 2.5 out of 5 star rating
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:34:44


The price of Comcast alone is more than enough to encourage new competition in the space and yet there still isn't any for a litany of reasons.  Comcast has a defacto monopoly for about 80% of its customers.  An unrestricted Comcast doesn't lead to new competition.  It will lead to hell on earth.

There is 1 DSL - AT&amp;T.  Which offers a 1 year rate $40/month for 50mbps.  Regular rate is $70/month.  2.5 star rating.
As expected, there are very few choices, all of them are overpriced and extremely lowly rated by their current customers.  That is an situation begging for competition and yet there still isn't any.  Thus, net neutrality.

This site is somewhat popular.  Its not way underground, but as others have said it has a bad reputation.  Last year I made a 1k bet on sports, won, and it took a really really long time to get the withdrawal, but I did end up getting it and the check did clear.  But it took so long that there were several points where I wondered if I was never  going to get it.  It should be very interesting how quickly they process things now with bitcoin.  If its not wildly improved immediately, then the site is just plain sketchy and stay away.
