There will always be a number. It's the nature of proof-of-work. The longer we go on, the less realistic it is. Pools are a problem but you know that from the ghash drama last week.

No, they would only have to register in the state where their customers are, i.e. the state they operate in.

Goldcoast does not seem to have a Bitcoin payment option. Anyone know why?

I think what we are talking about is hand to hand sales in a brick and mortar store. User buys bitcoin, sends to family after they leave the store and family members sells btc at a pawn shop on the other side. Pawn Shops would become Hawaladars.

I hear what you are saying but if we are talking about a pawn shop (brick and mortar) then their customers would all be in one state. I think this means the requirement is for them to register in that state only.

You are correct. I think Satoshi did say these same things. Only, he said it without the disadvantage of being well known throughout history and studied under a microscope. This is the genius of knowing that to be well known is to be a known Hypocrite as all of us surely are.

What I meant was that on an exchange you are actually buying from or selling to another individual. An exchange matches buyers and sellers and takes a trade execution fee. With coinbase they are the seller if you are the buyer and vice versa. This is why they set their prices from the Bitstamp API. There is no price discovery that's internal to Coinbase and set by supply and demand. The supply and demand function happens at Bitstamp.

Yes. Coinbase is not an exchange. They sell bitcoins and buy them. There is no orderbook. You can see this by the fact that when you sell coins your USD is not kept on Coinbase. Immediately an ACH deposit is initiated to your bank account.
@_date: 2013-08-20 14:06:36
I don't think it's safe to leave any funds (btc or USD) on any exchange. Some do it because they have calculated the risk and want to reap the reward from that risk. There is nothing wrong with that but they just have to accept the potential for loss in a situation where the exchange goes under.

Don't store it all on one address. Print multiple paper addresses and spread it across them.

I don't think that calling Thomas Jefferson a hypocrite is an irrelevant personal attack and I do think that a person not really believing that "that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights" disqualifies him from saying so in a country's founding documents. I certainly didn't mean it as an ad hominem towards you. I just think that when the "founding fathers" are quoted it should be pointed out that all is not as it seems.

I agree with this but I always try not to call someone a fool and spell the words there and you're wrong in the same sentence. That's just me though. ;)
