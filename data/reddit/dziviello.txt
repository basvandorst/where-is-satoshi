Feel free to subscribe to the [subreddit]( too, we'll have posts on past draws and upcoming draws as they happen every 1000 blocks.

Yes, English text that outlines the drawing process. As I've said if you can find a flaw with the process in a way that deems it unfair, feel free to let me know. Sure the first draws will require trust, but no one is forcing you to participate. But like I've said, after multiple draws you will be able to go into the address history and verify all the payouts yourself. The payouts are done through a hardware wallet manually.

We appreciate you taking the time to respond. We unfortunately can not be as decentralized and trustless as BTC the currency currently is. We chose BTC over smartcontracts due to the market dominance and adoption that bitcoin has. However, we completely understand yours and anyone's hesitation and can only hope that our proven track record will speak for itself in the future. If you have any further questions feel free to reach out.

Yep! And because we will never change the 1LottoBtc address, you’ll be able to see that we picked the right winner for every previous draw too by looking in the address history.
I understand it's not 100% trustless. But the claim that it is probably fair and transparent are both true.

The algorithm is publicly available, meaning absolutely anyone will be able to do the algorithm themselves after the draw and get the same winners that we have selected. We publicly present the secret key to the server hash after the drawing, so it is verifiable that we didnt change that number within the draws time, as well as use publicly available information like the future block hash and the block timestamp to achieve the winner. This can all be verified by any third party

It is transparent in the sense that everything is on-chain and can be verified by any third party. Transparent = we are not doing anything or manipulating anything behind the scenes and all money flowing in and out of the Lotto address can be monitored and audited by anyone by looking at the blockchain.

We understand the hesitation to begin with, but eventually, our future track record, verifiability, and ability to audit will be a feature that no other lottery in the world has.
@_date: 2018-06-21 00:23:31
The issue is, there would have to be trust that I indeed used the site you provided, where as with our algorithm it can be verified and checked. Those are two completely different things
@_date: 2018-06-20 17:29:47
There are no 'backdoors', there is no code that has access to any of your information. The algorithm is easily laid out [here]( It is provably fair through this algorithm. The lottobtc address used will be static, so every draw and payout will be able to be audited.
Thats why it's provably fair and transparent.
If you can find a flaw with the randomizing process, feel free to let me know. But because it uses a combination of a future block hash and a secret key which the miners do not know, the randomized winner can't be known by anyone until after the draw.
We use segwit because there is no vanitygen software for segwit as of yet, and we wanted an address that was very hard to recreate and easily identifiable (ie our 1LottoBtc address)

You can look through our [random lottery algorithm]( ) if you'd like
This is a provably fair lottery and will be auditable for all future and past draws

No worries! Thanks for stopping by and maybe we will see you around in a couple hundred draws!
@_date: 2018-06-22 19:43:16
Thanks for the reply, initially we wanted to use the least amount of characters per winner as it would allow for more expandability in the near future (ie the more secondary/tertiary winners), The SHA256 hash gives us 64 characters, so that allows us up to 7 random winners, including the 1st-5th place when the prize pool is in excess of 2.5btc, it gives us an extra 2 places for promotional draws, etc. 
However, if down the line we see exponential growth to the point where a 687.19 BTC draw is possible, we can change the drawing algorithm months in advance to account for 10 characters instead of 9.
Hopefully that answers your question, thanks!

It is drained every week and paid out to the winners + our 5% rake.
Every bitcoin address is controlled by someone, though.
