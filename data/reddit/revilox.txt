Think about it this way.
You buy a pizza for 10 dollars. 10 years later, with inflation and the like, the 10 dollars will probably be worth just under or above 10 dollars. 
You buy a pizza for equivalent of 10 USD in BTC, and 10 years later, those BTC are now worth 100 USD.
Yes they could buy 10 usd of BTC everyday, but that's less profitable because the cost of making that pizza is maybe 3-4 bucks, yet your getting 10 USD worth of BTC for it now which will only increase over time. Hope that makes sense?

That is indeed exactly what I plan to do. My first buy in will be 1k. So I just want to get the most bang for my buck :)
I realize no one can predict the future, but I also realize there are people on here with tons more knowledge and experience than me and I want to take these opinions into consideration before acting.

It really is a fantastic win-win-win scenario! A win for the consumer getting a big discount, a win for the retailer as they will most likely end up making a ton of money through this in the long run rather than lose money, and then, arguably most importantly, a big win for the hodlers! :)

you think it will continue to dip for 2 more weeks? How low do you think it will dip?

ive been waiting to make my first buy for the last week now and have been a good and patient boy. But i worry about being too patient and buying too late. Any tips?

Wouldn't it make more sense to invest a lot more now since the price is relatively low compared to where we see this going, and then adding a few hundred every now and then? Would keep the cost average down right? thanks for your input!

Really helpful thanks. I decided last week I was going to invest and have been studying up and learning a lot. I still haven't invested yet, but have ordered my trezor yesterday and am in for the long run. I'm just waiting for the right time to buy in, keeping a close eye on cryptowatch, like everyone else :) My plan is to buy €1500 of BTC, 550-600 of which will go towards 10 LTCs and the rest I keep in BTCs. perhaps buy 10 OMGs. Would love to get your thoughts and recommendations :)

As a poker player i am familiar with concepts like "bank roll management" which i think applies here too. I am not investing anything i am not ok with losing. the thing is i really.... bitlieve.... this is going to take off. :)
I have bought a trezor and am hodling everything on there :) I am in it for the long run and am not the kind to panic sell when prices halve for a year. This is a looooong term process and i am ok with that! 
So with that info, still suggest i start small?

Most people don't spend their BTC's because they believe the value will still rise significantly, and so a purchase today worth 10 USD in BTC, will in the long term be worth perhaps 10x or more.
So this short term saving opportunity will convince these people to part with their BTC while the retailers believe that they will recover the discount they gave as the BTC value rises. Very smart IMO
