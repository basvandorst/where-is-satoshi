How is electrum better?
@_date: 2017-02-07 17:57:01
I've used bitaddress offline to generate and I have the rest right now in ethereum, planning to move the ether amount in a bip39 I set up earlier, I'm still just a little confused regarding the address and keys with that so I'll probably do it later. I don't really understand why bip39 has an address and both a public and private key whereas bit address just has an address and private key. So not really sure what the purpose of the public key is but I'll do extra reading later.

I moved mine out of Coinbase after hearing various complaints through the subreddit.
@_date: 2017-02-08 06:52:27
What's the likelihood of them exchanging information with authorities though? If things explode will holders there be paying tax? I'd like to see a thread about Coinbase on here, I only started to consider this move when I seen some threads about how badly Coinbase had dealt with some people.
@_date: 2017-02-07 06:43:42
So I should take down the seed as well then obviously.
Sorry about the simple questions here, it's just with even the most obvious bit of information omitted it further increases my paranoia. The volatility of btc in that regard is definitely something that doesn't mix well with my personality. I'm even questioning your link to that generator! 
So far I've been told Coinbase, blockhain.info, bitaddress.org and Electrum are all programs I shouldn't be using and they're some of the most accessible and popular methods for the layman, it's really hard to feel confident about any method for me right now. This kind of confusion is what's holding btc back for the gen pop imo.
@_date: 2017-02-03 13:25:39
Just want to bump this as I'm a little bit confused...
I created an address on bitaddress.org and used this to transfer from Coinbase to blockchain.info. I then imported my key to my newly made blockchain.info wallet. So doesn't that mean my btc is still stored online, just on a different wallet?  
@_date: 2017-02-06 08:21:11
Knots/Core is &gt;100gb, do people really go to those lengths for security? How is Knots/Core better? I thought having offline storage was the best method?
@_date: 2017-02-07 06:29:26
Do I not need an address too?
@_date: 2017-02-07 05:02:54
From what I gather you need to download the entire blockchain before you begin to do that and then change source code. Is Knots/Core not just another SPV wallet like electrum or bread?
@_date: 2017-02-08 20:13:50
Sounds like a pretty big negative for Coinbase there, I see your point though. Its for another thread I guess
@_date: 2017-02-07 10:43:16
Haha, that end bit is quite the asterisk. I'd say if numbers continue the most I will do is cash-out a decent portion of my initial investment and/or start using hardware to pay for things. I totally see your point about growth but one month is so short-sighted, although I know you're probably being facetious to an extent. 
I think there's a good chance we'll see an attack on btc soon by the institutions of power. I'll be amazed if somehow this etf sneaks in, if it doesn't I think governments will catch up in terms of trying to regulate. That 1% of 1% you mentioned don't hold the same power as that other "1%" tag we know about, if anything it's probably the more powerless than powerful that hold right now, to me that's a big sign that there's a huge fight on in the future. I'm going to put away my investment like it's already lost and get out the popcorn for the ensuing chaos.
@_date: 2017-02-08 14:08:17
What about if you hold bitcoin for a profit?
@_date: 2017-02-07 09:09:39
A regular here, Luke-jr, posted that "Both bitaddress.org and blockchain.info are terrible for security." This is what put me off of bitaddress, but I did do exactly what you did with it before moving over to blockchain.
I think I'll re-do this then, maybe combined with 537511s post I will split it and create two holdings and then consider where they'll be kept, which is a more fun discussion.
Thanks for your input. I do have to admit that your bullishness really annoys me though! I'll happily re-do this after I get my hardware in a month if you're right, but there's such a bumpy road in sight when you're holding anything that I feel it's better to ignore all news unless it's significant and if it's significant still ignore half of it. 
@_date: 2017-02-07 07:39:49


I haven't got any ios devices unfortunately. What would the method of retrieval be if the device is damaged or stolen?
@_date: 2017-02-06 08:44:41
Any chance you could direct me to a dummies guide?
@_date: 2017-02-06 17:42:56


Where do SPV wallets generate their PRNG from?
@_date: 2017-02-07 07:50:38
Also don't see how this is more secure than offline storage which is what I'm trying to do.
@_date: 2017-02-07 07:07:15
Thanks for that.
I think I will re-do my paper based hold and look for a secure way to do so. Do you have any opinions on the generators that create these? For instance I was told bitaddress.org was the standard and also told its a terrible solution. Then 537311 links me another generator which could very well be reputable but its very hard to take just one or two peoples word on reliable methods here, for there are so many dissenting opinions and potential traps.
I like the hardware idea, but my main reasons as to why I wouldn't go down that road are 1. I don't need to spend the btc.
                                 2. It's not enough of a holding right now to            invest 100 imo. I want to actually forget I even own this really. I'm looking at securing what I've got and forgetting about btc until I come across it in the public domain from time to time.
If things continue to progress upwards I would definitely look at hardware to hold 5-10%, but I honestly don't think that's something I will be considering for years right now. For the time being I just want to get my holding off of Electrum and bitcoin.info to the right place
@_date: 2017-02-06 17:20:34
What kind of faults have they had? What's to stop SPV wallets from having similar kinds of faults in the future?
@_date: 2017-02-14 19:02:11
So far I like the initial idea of hammering it out onto a plate anyway. The problem I have with a safe is it's expensive. As people have said with burial there is a problem with someone else retrieving it but I would agree that you could be coerced regardless of the situation.
@_date: 2017-02-07 15:58:03
Amazing, there's so much differing opinion regarding security. I've now come full circle to "you shouldn't of actually done anything in the first place, everything was fine".
@_date: 2017-03-14 21:32:51
If you looked through my post history you'd see I'm a long term holder.
@_date: 2017-03-14 21:55:57
the bitcoins?
@_date: 2017-03-15 01:12:44
This paragraph says it is possible but doesn't explain practically how I do it, I don't want to do something stupid sending a transaction which was why I was looking for a spoon fed solution.
@_date: 2017-03-14 21:33:36
this still the case?
@_date: 2017-03-14 22:57:28
So much for btc being handy didn't know I'd have to read a 9 page pdf to make a simple transaction.
@_date: 2017-01-24 03:25:05
Not really anymore decided with these option, I might get a paper wallet for now, seems more secure than online and cheap enough.
@_date: 2016-09-18 12:18:12
I'd be interested in what you described in your last paragraph. I wouldn't be averse holding as it's not burning a hole or anything, but I really need to understand it's volatility more now that I'm holding. It's probably a good thing I got it even though it's kind a hassle, there are some things I need to be educated on that could benefit me in other aspects beyond what to do with the btc itself.
@_date: 2016-09-18 14:34:05
I suppose this is an issue I have with holding right now. I'm quite uninformed regarding btc compared to others, but what I do believe is the initial "explosion" in terms of exponential rise in value has passed. 
The main reason I feel this way, which isn't based on anything empirical so I'll accept derision here, is the fact that I'm aware of the currency and the furore about it and have been for some time. I would consider myself little more than an average member of public when it comes to being exposed to these things, so what that tells me is many of the early opportunities of massive returns have ended. Even just looking at the graph on Wiki for Relative mining difficulty since 2009 shows just how far it has come and just how much of its potential is now in the past. 
I'm very interested in speculative investments that are low risk/high reward but extremely unlikely. It feels like btc no longer fits this form now, but is firmly in the camp of medium risk/medium reward for me. I know that might sound simplistic but it's the best way I can describe my outlook on it right now.
@_date: 2016-09-18 14:49:10
Another off-putting factor in holding for me, not just volatility with market fluctuation but volatility to theft. I suppose this is possible with brokers also so it's not like you're ever safe to such risks but it can be extra off putting in this environment. There are new ways of being a victim to fraud here outside maybe your more conventional white collar corruption.
@_date: 2016-09-18 14:41:16
Fees are fees, I guess I was just surprised when I seen it. I was under the impression that all charges regarding transactions/conversions involving btc were negligible to a revolutionary degree. 1.5% is not a negligible amount for this imo
edit-also buying with debit card is 4%! 
@_date: 2016-09-19 22:32:43
Are they not reputable? I just signed up there.
@_date: 2016-09-20 00:44:16
I sold for euros today, would you say that rule applies for keeping other currency there? I would've that all wallets like you mentioned were "custodial' in that sense but I guess I'm wrong. Are there any benefits regarding fees with other wallets?
@_date: 2016-10-10 11:20:55
What format are these odds? From a glance I can't make any sense of it
@_date: 2016-10-10 23:08:24
I presumed this was conventional decimal odds which would make no sense looking at the odds of each candidate compared with what most bookmakers are offering.
Edit- I think I'm reading the weight of btc on each candidate as the odds.
