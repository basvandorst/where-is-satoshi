Once the difficulty adjust though, we are going to probably see a build up of mempool again. Block times have gone well below the 10 minute normal which effectively gives us more blocks in less time, which helps relieve backlog. But when difficulty adjusts, we will be back to every 10 minutes. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 04:01:17
Exactly, still 40k transactions in mempool. This post is a big bs lie.

I sold all my shares the day that the vote passed to give 100% dividends instead of using 50% to purchase new eqiipment. That was an epic fail move thay turned a profitable stock into simply buying your own mining equipment. If they stopped upgrading equipment like they said,  then the only place the stock can go is down as dividends decrease because difficulty goes up. Bad move petamine. 
I don't mind though,  I doubled my money in 2 weeks and got out in time.

You can get a pizza pretty much anywhere in the united states. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 17:11:42
Heres a basic explanation. If somebody steals your bitcoins, you can see where they get sent. For example, to the thiefs wallet. 
If you watch it, you can then see what the thief does with them. If he puts them through a mixing service, it could get a little tricky, but if he just keeps them and then spends, them, say on a pizza, and you see that they were spent at an address owned by pizzaforcoins, you could email pizzaforcoins and be like "hey, on this date at this time, you had a transaction for this much money that was paid by a customer, those coins were stolen, where was the pizza delivered and what was the name under?"
Make sense?
With cash, if somebody steals it, its just gone. 
FWIW, we are pizzaforcoins don't actually OWN the bitcoin addresses so we could not actually look that up, however bitpay that processes our payments could and the dots could be connected. 
EDIT FOR CLARITY AGAIN: We would never give customer information to just ANYBODY, we would only provide it to law enforcement agencies who are investigating a bitcoin theft. By "you" I did not mean "anybody" though I should have shown that better. What I am saying is somebody can follow the breadcrumbs. That is ALL that my statement was attempting to show. 
@_date: 2014-08-23 05:33:12
that particular account had a weaker password. It was not shared with any other accounts. ALL accounts I have 2FA except coinurl, because they do not offer it and I am closing my account with them now because of their lack of 2FA. 
ANY bitcoin service that has a balance of coins MUST be 2fa enabled, end of story. 
I noticed that coinurl put a really crappy captcha at the login screen (easily readable by a bot) so they must have been having issues with brute forcing of user accounts, but whoever is in charge of their security has not done enough here. 
No funds lost, I'm simply letting the word out to others so anybody using coinurl.com will know of the risks. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 17:28:22
Being that I am the co-founder of pizzaforcoins, no, I am NOT obligated, however I would help out any investigations that were being made, as would any other business. 
That is the reason mt gox, coinbase, bitstamp, and all others require verification. They have to be able to lock an identity with coins so that they can assist any investigations that are being made. 
EDIT for clarity: When I said "Investigations" I am referring to a LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY INVESTIGATION. 
PizzaForCoins would not give up information just cause "Joe Bitcoiner" asked us to.

@_date: 2014-01-07 15:28:03
The way most retailers do it, and how I would suggest. 
Your fridge is priced at 1000 dollars. They can pay in btc if they want, and if they want to return, they get the 1000 dollars back. Simple as that.  They did not lose any money, the risk is not on anybody. Its similiar to rules retailers have about returns with no receipt can only be given store credit, etc. 
I know you brought up how they would "lose" or "gain" usd depending on returns. Like I said, just say bitcoin payments are final and can only be refunded in usd. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 15:29:41
they do allow multiple logins. I have done it with two computers sitting on my desk. Its POSSIBLE that they limit to 1 ip address at a time, but I doubt it. Just enable 2FA and you should be fine. 
@_date: 2014-01-07 06:25:09
Your mistake here was trying to buy when you didn't have the coins available. Would you go into a liquor store to pay with cash and let them ring you up and say "that will be 9 dollars" and then you say "okay, let me to go my car and pull quarters out of the seat, I'll be right back" haha.
No offense, but that's basically what you did. I have made MANY bitcoin purchases from various merchants in person and online, all have been flawless. If you are going to buy something, you better have money with you. As simple as that.

This is very cool! I have ordered from ecodirect before. They are awesome! Great prices, great service, knowledgeable staff. Renee helped me with an order about 6 months ago for a 6k + kw system with mini inverters and I was very impressed. I am a general contractor and I will order all my solar panels from them in the future. The fact that they take bitcoin is just a bonus now!
Congrats on making the plunge to accept bitcoin! You are an early adopter and I hope you guys benefit from it!
@_date: 2014-01-29 00:47:46
Due to risk bitpay limits invoices to 15 minutes due to volatility. This is something to take up with bitpay, not tiger direct. When you make a payment the coins go to a wallet controlled by bitpay and if you pay too late, they are the only ones capable of correcting or refunding it.

Thank you for the explanation. You are spot on. I hope you realize I was not trying to be an ass. You first post just came off easily misunderstood but you definitely clarified the "circulation" you were talking about. I would call that more of "transaction volume" but circulation can also be used to describe it. 
IMHO busunesses that don't at least hold some bitcoins from sales and try to pay for some expenses with it are not really accepting it at all, instead are just jumping on the pr bandwagon. Haha, but I can't complain. That will come in time.

Don't get me wrong buddy. Haha, I know. I moved all my coins out of gox after the April disaster. I'm simply pointing out the volume. 
If gox IS insolvent, all those traders are helping gox dig themselves out of insolvency. Interesting concept. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 04:11:55
The buttercoin project is no new contender. This project first surfaced after the April 2013 crash. The plan was to build an open source scaleable trading platform capable of tens of thousands of trades per second. They got a lot of VERY experienced interest, and eventually they forked the whole idea from open source trading platform, to a professional US exchange. 
I assume they have been hard at work putting this together and figured now is good a time as any to try and launch or at least gain user interest.
I cannot speak in regards to their license statuses, however I will say this is a professional organization and I am sure that their licenses are either obtained, or in the pipeline.

Yes, he did not "invent" the internet. However I think there is no harm in saying that he "basically invented the internet". 
He invented mosaic which was the first popular web browser. He then went on to be a founder of netscape which was HUGE. The list goes on and on.

@_date: 2014-02-16 17:38:44
I run pizzaforcoins.com and have dealt with this issue and originally thought it to be a problem. Let me explain. 
Customer pays, and payment NOTIFICATION is made instantly (within 5 seconds it should be received). This completes the transaction on the website from the customers point of view. 
As the business owner, before shipping a product, it is the business owners call to asses his risk. 
If it is for a 25cent "paywall" to read a news paper, I would call that a low risk and the payment notification would be enough. 
At pizzaforcoins, we wait for 1 confirmation typically, which is 10 minutes. Once a payment gets 1 confirmation it becomes magnitudes harder to double spend. 
Keep in mind, these are small pizza transactions so the risk is low.
If I were selling 10,000 dollar servers, I would definitely wait 6 confirmations. 6 confirmations are approximately 1 hour. If somebody pays 10,000 dollars for a server, the server most likely would be lucky to even be shipped out same day... so confirmation speed really should not matter at all. 
The thing that DOES need to be sped up is transaction VOLUME. Currently there is a soft limit of 7 transactions per second that the network is capable of which is not adequate for mainstream. THAT is something that needs to improve. The Devs are hard at work on possible solutions. There is more then one way to skin a cat as they say, and there is many ways to solve the problem. 
@_date: 2014-06-27 20:38:46

as long as you realize that you will most likely LOSE money. I speak from owning 2 BFL miners. I pre-ordered fairly early, had them in my hand in september ish. They will never make as much BTC if I were to have just bought BTC with the cash instead. 
Before sinking 20k into it, I would recommend picking up a small miner and trying it out for a week or two so you can get past your infatuation with mining. haha. Then you will probably come to the realization that its way too competitive now. haha. 
@_date: 2014-01-16 14:23:19
Behindtext, that was exactly my point, but I refrained from saying it. Haha, I too have done extensive research on money transmission.... I sent snap card an email to the tune of your post at the same time I made my post to keep it a little more private. Oh well. User beware using this service. A company like this must be registered in all 48 states that require licenses. There's especially no way around it since they are based in San Francisco, California is not friendly to money transmitting startups. 
@_date: 2014-01-07 02:42:40
At pizzaforcoins we recieved the same email but our email address is posted publicly on our website. I assume there is just somebody going around and collecting email addresses on bitcoin related sites. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 17:53:05
I don't have "PROOF" that they eat the costs, however I will say that in the past I have gotten emails from bitpay saying something along the lines of:
"The payment XXXX that was received has not confirmed in over an hour, there is a variety of reasons for this (yada yada yada). **Your coins will be credited to your account once the transaction has gotten 6 confirmations**"
That leads me to believe that they are warning me, the business to not send out the goods because the money did not come through.
In all cases, it has never been from a double spend, usually just low fees causing it to take a while to confirm. 
@_date: 2014-03-31 23:06:53

We still have orders coming in daily. We have a different philosophy then gyft. Gyft sells ALL COINS the moment they receive them. Because of that, I will never support gyft. They do not really believe in bitcoin, they believe in making money. 100% of coins pizzaforcoins recieves are kept in bitcoin. We only ever sell exactly what is needed to pay any bills and only as that need arises.  We have not sold any coins for the last 3 weeks.. We purchase all business items with bitcoin to support the bitcoin economy of true users. Not just corporations looking to make a buck. Those who have ordered with us know that we take care of our customers and try to give them the best support possible. We also are cutting out extra steps. 
From pizzaforcoins, you place your order with us and your pizza comes. With gyft,  you buy a gift card, then place an order with the pizza place. 
I can understand people not wanting to pay our premium, but it's a freemarket and we do not oppose how you want to spend your money, whether with us, or with somebody else.

I think you misunderstood my post and it is partially my fault for not clarifying. No, we would NOT give up anybodies name just because we received an email. My post stated:

their big market is in euros, but I think that will change as time goes on. Unlike other exchanges, they will NOT take on customers unless they are fully complying with all rules and regulations. Because of the US money transmission rules, they will only take customers from 2 or so states right now. They are actively pursueing becoming licensed in the remaining 48 states though from what I understand.

Haha at your edit with your personal info. No hard feelings I hope. There have been some insane scams in bitcoin over the years and many old timers see a post like this and laugh and say "oh yeah, give my coins to a random guy on reddit and he will help me, I've heard that before and it ended badly" haha. 
I have run many bitcoin businesses over the past year and some have gone well, some have gone badly. The biggest thing in the bitcoin space is transparency. You are dealing with an irreversible money that once gone is gone, and most bitcoin users have become EXTREMELY security conscious. 
I myself co-founded ForCoins LLC which owns pizzaforcoins and many other smaller sites. This is a whole different ballgame then anything youve been involved with. 
My advice. Stay transparent, stay in contact, and you will get respect and help with whatever you want to achieve. The community is VERY helpful and friendly, but they are just on-guard against anything that remotely sounds like a scam. Haha. 
Good luck with your endeavors and if you have any questions from somebody with experience running a business dealing with bitcoin, feel free to contact me on pm. I have been at it over a year, our business has gotten alot of attention and we've seen alot of things unfold.

Lol. Do the math buddy. They are missing 800k coins. There's only 12.5 ish million in existence. Even somebody who is not a math genius knows that its approximately 7-8%. Not counting the additional 800-1million coins Satoshi owns. So it is closer to 8-9% probably with lost coins, etc, its even higher then 10%. 
Blockchain has a million wallets. 
Coinbase has a million users. 
You KNOW there's overlap of users there. 
Even if you had a million people participate and donate 5 dollars each, that's 5 million dollars. Not even a drop in the bucket to the 500 million that's missing. 
I lost a small amount (.45 coins). And it is what it is. I don't expect bitcoiners to bail me out. Luckily that isn't a drop in the bucket for me. I moved the majority of my coins out of gox LONG ago.

Heres some ideas:
For any office hardware/electronics. They have other random things in their catalog too and very competitive prices. 
On coinmap.org it says a dental office near you guys accepts bitcoin. 
Theres also a few places in carlsbad that accept it as well. 
I would encourage you to spend it "directly" to a fellow business that accepts it. No harm against gyft (ive used them a few times)... but when you pay gyft, they just auto-sell the entire amount of coins so it doesn't really help the bitcoin economy, as they are not risking any skin in accepting it. 
Overstock.com takes bitcoin too and is sort of like an online target. haha. They auto-sell the coins too, but they say that they hang onto a certain percentage of each order. 
And you could always order a pizza from

Charge backs are useful when they are legitimate. Here's my only time I had to do a charge back:
-I purchased an airline ticket for 620 dollars, from a smaller airline through their website. Got the tickets, took the flight, all was good.
-statement comes and I realize they charged me at the time I booked the ticket, then charged me again for the same amount on Sunday night of that week at midnight.  
-I called the airline, they didn't see the charge in their system and claimed it was only charged once and that there was nothing else they could do to help me. 
-I called credit card and had the charge reversed. 
This type of charge would not ever be possible via bitcoin though because the airline could NEVER have debited my bitcoin balance without my private key.
so in the end, even though a charge back was done, if it had been paid in bitcoin orginally, they duplicate charge would never have been possible.
Bitcoin for the win :-)

On a side note, its really truly cool that you guys are accepting bitcoin now. I have a funny story with my order. When I placed it, you guys said for large orders you preferred I don't use a credit card because of the 3% fee. I asked what other forms of payment you accepted. At the time, it was bank transfer or check. I sent a check and didn't even think to mention bitcoin, and low and behold it was already on your radar as a way to greatly reduce your fees. 
@_date: 2014-08-10 15:23:50

I agree partially. I will not accept the rate as a valid exchange rate for conducting commerce because it is not able to actually be exchanged with gox, its just frozen funds. HOWEVER, I do not write off the 200 dollar coins on gox as "trash".

I would never recomened anybody buying a BFL, but I must say, I ordered one last March and got it in October I think it was, and it has paid for itself 3 times. The only thing is if I would have just bought coins with the money, it would have 10X its value. But its all luck. If the price didnt jump like it did, I would not have made 3X from my miners and I wouldn't have 10X coins that I bought either... if that makes sense.

The account never got hacked with 2FA. It was hacked through the API which was connected to some app on the phone. 
API keys BYPASS 2FA people, get that through your heads! So if you don't need API keys, ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS make sure they are turned off. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 20:26:22
Rather then complain, do something about it! Support the other exchanges, pull your money out (if and when you can), and tell others to do the same. 
It is as simple as that. No need to create a circle jerk stating everything we already know.

Technically, bitcoin has no "in charge" guy. There is developers who WORK on it but they can't push out updates to the rest of the community. They can release new updates and it is the communities decision whether to adopt their changes or to stick with the existing. So If they did something that the community did not agree on, it would not be adopted.

You can give them fiat and you can buy btc. The problem is that withdrawals are disabled from their website currently. Because of this, there is no arbitrage opportunity to be had. 
They claim they will let us know the status on Thursday. Don't get your hopes up.

I don't think people fully comprehend what opportunities this can open up. Mining In itself doesn't Excite investors much cause any seasoned investor has experience with the arms race of mining and knows how quickly your state of the art mining equipment becomes obsolete.
Where this concept flourishes is with a business who sells products or services. They are now able to help their customers who may not qualify for conventional financing, get community driven crowdsourced financing.
I'm disappointed that this post didn't get more visibility because I'm very curious to hear what people think of the concept besides myself

theres been alot of these reports floating around today. seems that either there OLD database breach is being used to access old accounts, or a new database breach is. In either case. I have an account with a small amount of funds in it, but I have not received any email. I also have 2FA enabled though, so that might be why.

I'm curious what your company does in terms of money transmitter compliance as your business model is definitely a money transmitter in all 48 states that require a license. Are you actively pursuing licenses? Do you feel that they don't apply to your business? If so please explain. 
I would love to use your service but have those questions first. 
From my understanding, you are doing the same thing as bitspend, who ended up getting their bank accounts frozen and funds seized along the lines of money transmission. 
Not trying to be a troll, I love the idea, I love the awesome work you have put into making it so easy. I'm just trying to understand how you are conforming to rules and regulations in the United States.

think what you like, no backtracking was done there, I even referenced that exchanges verify identities of customers in order to aid in investigations being made. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:48:15
Except that in order to take advantage of the bug you would need to withdrawal money from the exchange and they required a verified account (photo id, etc) to do so.

Coinbase purchases take a while to "clear" unless you are verified for Instant Buy. They do this to prevent fraud.
They are reputable and if there IS an issue, they will correct it. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 19:18:00
That is all speculation though. The only way those coins really "left circulation" is if mark lost the keys and they are in effect BURNED. Otherwise if a hacker truly did steal them, then they are still very much in circulation. 
@_date: 2014-01-16 15:23:00
To be clear, snap card used for product purchases at websites is not the problem. It is the introduction of bill pay services. As behindtext said, there is no goods or services being rendered. Though the product purchases are grey area because you technically are not the one rendering the products, but people have drop shipping businesses all the time so we will call that un-clarified territory

I disagree with your statement respectfully. I had the same view as you origonally when I heard the announcement but after hearing what the CEO had to say, hear what my wife had to say (apparently she buys things all the time there and I had no idea).

They have enough working capital that they already have cash in their bank account ready to ach to you from the moment that somebody pays them. So they initiate the achs bank transfers daily. I'm sure they have integrated with the exchanges to auto-sell when a payment is made, the correct amount having to do with the payment. This eliminates or greatly reduces their risk. Then they transfer money from the exchange that they sold at to their bank to replenish the USD that they sent the merchant. Simple concept really.

I like where you are coming from! We should have a way of verifying the funds that we deposit are still in possession of the site operators. This is a complicated issue to resolve, but nothing is impossible. 
That is one thing that I love about the bitcoin community.

Yes, you are true in your points about having the money. HOWEVER I agree with op. I have used btc in person multiple times and 25% of the time, the transaction does not even show up on the vendors tablet or phone for 2 or 3 minutes. I'm not talking about confirming. I'm talking about even SHOWING UP as unconfirmed. 
Though this is not the protocols fault, its likely the fault of third party wallets delays in sending or pushing new data to the phones of tablets. None the less, its a drag. There's room to improve.

You say "more businesses in bitcoin equals more bitcoins in circulation which equals less scarcity" 
Wtf do you mean? please explain. Bitcoins in circulation is a fixed rate of increase that doesn't change whether there's 1 person using bitcoin or 100million using bitcoin. Your statement either was "mis-stated" or you have no clue how bitcoin works. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 20:24:30
Not to mention lets say you put funds in coinbase which then puts your coins in cold storage with everybody else's. so how on earth does that work? Supposed the good coins now get mixed with bad. That would be a nightmare to try and enforce, not to mention, practically impossible. 
@_date: 2014-01-22 04:33:58
The title of this is very misleading. It makes it out like microsoft "mass hacked" into 2 million computers and removed something from them. All they did was release a virus definition to remove the "malware" if it is present just like they have done with malware since the begining of an antivirus program. 
Im waiting for somebody to release a "spoof" of this titled

Erik, I know how you feel. I've done alot of interviews for pizzaforcoins. Most have always gone well, but there's the occasional journalist who should not be doing news, and instead has the writing styles of a low life national enquirer. They take quotes out of context and can make things you said sound completely the opposite of how the conversation went. 
Sorry you had to deal with that. The good news at least is that MOST of the media that I have heard the last few days has been surprisingly accurate and semi positive. Most stations in my area (Los Angeles) did a bundled story where they headlined with the troubles at gox, but finished by talking about second markets exchange plans slated for this summer. A sort of "out with the old in with the new" I was very pleased by MOST of te coverage. 
Bitcoin has become mature enough that it can take some bad news :-) 
@_date: 2014-07-09 19:31:05

the OP was very misleading in his title. They are testing a micropayments paywall and all the payments are donated to a non profit. So they ARE donations, but not to the sun times. 
That being said, I did donate 0.16 USD in BTC to demonstrate how easy it is to accept small payments with little or no fee.

I had no issues for the first 2 and a half years of using coinbase. But then, when I did, it took OVER 3 weeks to get support to help me. First response after 1 week said it was being escalated, another week later, they replied and said "are you still having issues", I replied yes within one hour of receiving that, and they said they would get back to me. I happened to have personal emails for the founders and finally bothered them (though I didn't want to do this at first). Issue finally got resolved after having FUNDS STUCK for 3 weeks. I pulled out all funds and now leave NO crypto in any third party. Not FUD, just facts. Coinbase is an honest company, they are by the book and will not screw you, BUT if you do have an issue, be prepared to wait A LONG TIME to get it resolved. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 13:53:41
Yeah, wallets need to work on their estimated fee code. Its always estimated too high.  I was going to do a transaction a few days back and copay wallet suggestes 700 sat/byte which is just crazy.  
@_date: 2017-11-21 13:47:37
Exactly.  Many wallets are miscalculating fees. I have been sending transactions with fees between 15 and 25 sat/byte and they have all been confirming within 30 or less minutes. Sometimes even in next block.

1. Yes, if your entire device is compromised, you could lose your device. This is why you should use multisig. 
2. BITCOIN CORE STANDARD WALLET stores your seed in plaintext too by DEFAULT unless you enable encryption! 
3. It has option to enable encryption and wipe seed from device and warns you to backup!!! 
4. Newsflash!!! Bitcoin.com wallet = Copay.io Wallet = Bitpay Wallet. 
Roger didn't create this wallet from scratch! He took copay wallet, had some developers modify it to his liking since it is open source and re-branded it. Nothing wrong with it, but you guys are all acting like its HIS wallet.

@_date: 2015-11-07 14:57:20
First, I want to start by saying that I personally had my business account for Pizza for coins closed on coinbase along with my personal. never found anything in the terms citing the reasons, but in either case, I chalked it up to regulatory issues with me having a business and them not being able to support it, so no hard feelings .
With that being said, that is not censorship. All my conversations were formal, and courteous, they sent me every penny in my account, and apologized for not be able to serve me as a customer anymore. 
Censorship would have been holding funds, not letting me pay certain people in normal operations, or having this comment removed. 
There is a difference between being censored and dealing with regulation. 
If does read this, I'd love if you could personally message me an explanation for why yoy guys closed my account of 3 years in perfect stqnding. Again, no hard feelings. 
I also support coinbase decision to go either way with bip 101. And I certainly am against censoring of companies in this subreddit. I have now unsubscribed due to theymos childish comments acting like he is a king. 
@_date: 2015-02-01 04:43:31
You are exactly right. The issue will be, how can isps control it. Not super easily.

I wish I was mistaken, but I am not. If my site bills them 50 bucks, their wallet gets deducted 50 bucks and they short me the transaction fee, so I end up with ~47-48. 
They see the 50 dollar payment in their coinbase wallet and send me screenshots and demand the 50 back when I tell them I can only refund the ~47-48 that I got. 
@_date: 2013-12-14 19:03:53

Pizzaforcoins here,We would highly recommend bitpay. We've been using them for around 1 year.yes we have experienced some issues, but all were resolved in a satisfactory time frame. 
Our only hesitation with recommending them would be that the whole community has put so much weight on bitpays shoulders that should their servers go down, you basically won't be able to buy anything with bitcoin from 80% of all bitcoin merchants. :-/

Prices all just updated to an exchange rate of 95. We choose our price based on the market buy walls, typically picking a price point that would take around 10k-15k coins to hit in case there's a big sell off. (we need to protect ourselves)
We have over 37 different gift cards.
If you request cards, we will add them. 
Our cards are supposed to be priced at approximately face value in normal conditions. We charge small premiums on gas cards and Amex cards as they impose HARD limits on methods of aquiring them. (Amex limits gift card purchases to 250 per week, gas cards must be paid for in hard cash (debit or wire) so they affect our cash flow greatly as you can imagine.

cut the OP some slack. Yes, for certain things, this would be pretty pointless (market, etc...)
HOWEVER there is an area that this could be HUGE. For bulky items such as furniture, toys, swingsets, Anything really. This idea could be brought even further to being able to shop in a showroom, and pick up at the warehouse loading dock all paid for ready to go. I see what the OP is envisioning. 
Yes, you are right though, this does not work for everything, but it could work extremely well for certain things. A place like ikea would love being able to get rid of all of their cashiers and just have sales floor people on the showrooms, and thats what this would be able to accomplish.

Basically what you are explaining is nothing new. It's the same way that you can "charge up your mt.gox" account with funds and trade back and forth instantly on it. You are trading on the third party so bitcoins don't have to confirm, because they are staying within a central bank. The issue with this is that it kills the whole "removing the bank" concept of bitcoin as it requires a processing house. My websites have been accepting large amounts of transactions using bitcoins. Since our sales are all online, we are at a higher risk of fraud. For a p.o.s. transaction, the risk is low that the customer will be trying to double spend after physically being there in person. He'd have to run to another store to spend. Not saying its perfect, but the risk is not that high. But with any normal payment, check, or credit, the charge could be reversed. Same risk in my opinion but at least in coins you know within 15 minutes if the charge was good or bad, rather then somebody doing a charge back 30 days down the road.

we allow options to pre-pay tip in which case you can tip a set amount on the gift card. that is for pizza hut and dominos. For papa johns if you want to tip we can add it on our end. :)
@_date: 2013-03-09 18:05:43
That is correct for that exact reason. All orders are manually filled. 
Also, trust me, we wanted a script allowing users to simply click "get info" and populate all your variables. We are looking into alternate methods to achieve this. The first few methods attempted or researched weren't possible due to browser security issues. I-Frames have distinct rules regarding transferring data between them if they are from different domain names because if you logged into a banking site in the frame, the other frame can't be allowed to "grab" the information. From the banking frame. If that makes sense.

I felt this bit was overall positive. I have been extremely pleased with the coverage that bbc has been giving to bitcoin, and you all should to. They are doing a great deal to do research. We at pizzaforcoins were contacted and interviewed by bbc reporters, I think somebody up high in bbc really is passionate about bitcoins and wants to make sure the world knows :-)
@_date: 2013-12-19 15:33:58
I am not talking about bitcoin companies.  Am talking about the protocol. If you use a a full node wallet or spv client, as long as you safeguard your keys properly, I don't care who you pay, no matter what happens, your private key will never be exposed and you don't have to trust anybody.

100% sure. Because my site does not quote the total in USD. I quote it in BTC. So I have a SET BTC price. I used the "50 usd" example for ease of understanding, but its more like:
Here is one of the transactions:
The total on my site was billed as: 
0.00881458 BTC.
Notice though how the fees were:
0.00084145 BTC
So I only got:
0.00797313 BTC

Though we would LOVE to do this, we need to be able to pay for orders with gift cards so that customers don't get our information and don't have to sign for a credit card that's not theirs.

I just want to say that coinbase came through here like they usually do. Their biggest problem is that they are swamped. 1 week ago or so they announced that they passed 600,000 users. Now they have hit 650,000. I would not want to be them right now. Dealing with that kind of exponential business growth could make you insane. Say all you want about how "that's a good problem to have". And I agree to a sense, but if you are not prepared, it can be hell to sort out. 
Could you handle a customer base of 650,000 overnight? How about you and 5 other people? How about you with 10 other people. Even with 10 employees that puts employee to client ratio at 1 employee to 65,000 customers. Oh, and that's just to handle support tickets, lets not forget that they have a big agenda of things they need to accomplish to move forward with new functionality!
Coinbase, you guys are awesome! Keep up the great work and reap the rewards, you guys deserve it!

Zero confirmations, they just wanted to see that the payment popped up in their wallet. They had one confirmation before we left the restaurant though. 
@_date: 2013-07-01 13:07:55
They are required to "Know Their Customer". It's part of being a money service business in the United States. The reason others don't ask is because either A: they are not dealing with money, or B: they are not complying to local laws. 
Have you ever become verified on mtgox or any other exchange? Same kind of deal, often times way more then that is required. Gox requires a copy of your utility bill and a copy of government issue id. 
@_date: 2013-06-08 17:06:38
Bitpay also takes advantage of a "exception" to money transmission laws. They have contracts with the businesses themselves. Because of that they are a "payment processor" and acting on the businesses behalf. So those issues more or less fall into the lap of the merchant. 
@_date: 2013-02-21 01:01:56
When we first came out with pizzaforcoins we used to have a script that grabbed the data off of the pizza company site through php. It worked great and was ideal. Due to legal reasons and possible skepticism about the security concerns of us accessing their website THROUGH our web server, we decided it to be the safest decision to remove the script. 
@_date: 2013-11-17 16:08:21

Just want to post a blanket to all the posts seen on here. Are you guys seriously even familiar with how public and private keys work and the bitcoin protocol in general!? It sounds to me like you are not. 
With public and private keys, if a merchant gets compromised, I don't care what you say, your bitcoin wallet will not be compromised PERIOD. The merchant only has your public key. NOBODY but you gets your private key. 
With credit cards, the merchant is handed all the information for your credit card with a swipe and with it they have the ability to make more charges with it (or a dishonest employee). With bitcoin, just cause you bought something, the merchant can never make a "extra" charge.
ONLY YOU can send out your coins as long as you are safe with how you handle your keys. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 06:00:50
Coinbase and bitpay have IPN callbacks that can trigger whatever script you have them call to. 
Blockchain.info also can monitor an address of your choosing and send IPN to a URL of your choosing as well.

If you have a gpu. Sure, it doesn't hurt. You won't make alot, but maybe a few cents. If nothing else, It will be offsetting the electricity while you are mining. Only if you have a gpu though. Don't bother CPU mining though... All that  do is slow down your computer and earn you nothing. You could mine litecoins with your CPU though and exchange them for bitcoins.

This hardly means anything... I am dissapointed that they JUST got their MSB number from fincen. I had hoped they were further along then that. 
That is the EASY part. 
Notice BitInstant Registered back in march 2012... a whole year before the march 18th 2013 guidance even was published. 
Bitinstant is also licensed in 30 of the required 48 states. 
They act like they are all "compliant"... but this is upsetting to see. 
I registered my bitcoin company with fincen. It takes 1 week to get a registration number and it is free. So this is NO BIG WIN.

We use e gift cards in the us. Regular gift cards usually are asked to be seen upon delivery. That's the issue there. If we have it in our possession, how can the customer show it to the driver. We research this more in the future though as that is a much better way to do the orders. :-) 
@_date: 2013-05-05 05:48:17
The pizzas should never be cold. :) From the moment they are placed they get delivered just like if you had called in and paid in cash or credit card. The only delay is PRE-submitting the order, so it just adds more time before the pizza actually gets made. 
@_date: 2013-06-14 19:38:31
I don't know Charlie personally but had the chance of hearing some of his panel discussions at bitcoin 2013. Their company is at a difficult stage, they are basically expanding from being a fly by night 2 guy operation, to being a much bigger and fully government compliant company. As such, they are going through terrible growing pains. I assure you, Charlie is not out to scam you guys, he's simply drowning in business and unfortunately, it doesn't look like he's keeping his head above water. Give him time to catch up. Though it may look bad, I don't feel his character is out to take your money and run. 
I think this new site launch caused some un-anticipated problems and with dealing with them all, they are getting further and further behind. 
As stated, I do not know Charlie or anybody at bitinstant personally. Just have met/seen them in person enough to feel like I know their character.

There is already a few other "foundations" of sorts. What I see though is a need for a "voting system" for new functionality or changes. For example in order to scale up to a larger transaction per second capability, there is many different "proposals". All of which have pluses and minuses. Wouldn't it be best if the users decide how they want the change to happen?

The hotel is prepaid completely. The front desk handles these types of transactions all the time. 
Upon check in they will ask you to put down your own credit card for "incidentals". This card which is owned by the customer is responsible for room service charges, charges to the hotel, and a security deposit in case something happens caused by the guest. 
Any questions, feel free to ask!

That is a question I have wondered as well. Why would that information be kept after the transaction is made (besides the last 4)
I am not too familiar with in person POS devices though so excuse my ignorance if I am missing something. 
Maybe the breach was happening at the point of the transaction being made? 
@_date: 2013-11-13 14:27:49
is your account a "merchant" account or have you ever generated a "buy now" button with it?

I see what you are saying, but you need to understand from a business standpoint, there is no suppliers to buy the hair from yet or any other hair supply's for that matter. When there is, I am sure he would be willing to accept the whole amount. In my opinion, its better for him to do it this way then to accept coins that he would just be cashing out instantly to pay for his supplies. (Instant selling coins hurts bitcoin more then helping) 
But I see your point. He'll read this all and take it into consideration. He's new to the community and still feeling it all out but I hope more and more service people will start accepting it as payment :-)

If somebody pays a 100 dollar bill (Internet, tv or phone) 
6% is 6 dollars. 
They are using bitpay which takes 1%, so they lose that instantly.
This brings them to 5 dollars which covers printing and mailing the check, postage, and book keeping fees. It leaves a very small left over to recoup development costs, let alone bring a profit.

Unfortunately it is the nature of bitcoin to attract these kind of businesses. That is very bold of them to do such an advertisement.... I hope that it comes back to bite them and they end up shut down. Tor sites are only as "safe" as their web master is sharp. It only takes one bug to compromise a server and get "real" ip information. 
@_date: 2013-06-14 13:34:18

hmm, sheds some light on the Defunct bitinstant... It made no sense, one week they are  bragging about how they are now "officially licensed" in X amount of states, the next week they are gone. 
FWIW, I did some research, they never were "licensed" themselves, they simply became an agent of a licensed money transmitter... Kinda false advertising in a way. Hope all is well with charlie and hope he gets this "mess" straightened out. I know many have there differences with bitinstant, but it always sucks to see that one of the original big players gets his business turned upside down. Eh, he probably has enough bitcoins at this point though that he doesnt even care about bitinstant anymore. lol

Upon check in they will ask for a credit card to put on file for any charges that may accrue while you stay there. This is noted on our site. The room price will be pre-paid though. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 16:13:06
Nope, I have experienced this as a merchant. If a chargeback is performed, yes the customer gets all his funds back, but the merchant gets screwed.

That is extremely weird... I look forward to hearing this explained
@_date: 2013-08-24 14:44:38
not to bash your idea here... and maybe it doesnt matter, but they are getting orders out the door, they are just way behind. So you can't sue on the grounds that they are "scamming" you out of money. 
What could give you a foot to stand on is the fact that they should have STOPPED allowing pre-orders after they started to get so far behind. 
When I ordered in march the way my invoice came and the checkout method was handled felt like... "expect them any day now, thanks for your order" haha. That is what was misrepresented.  And of course... Still waiting....
@_date: 2013-05-30 22:26:17
I don't get all you people saying "that's it" and "omg, I can't believe this". 
The fincen guidance is quite clear about exchanges being money transmitters and money transmitters are required to have a strong KYC (know your customer) policies. 
The reality is that any legitimate exchange will need to ask you for verification or they are breaking laws and will likely get shut down just like liberty reserve.
Not to mention without being verified, the withdrawal limits are a joke. 
I have a verified account on gox and on all exchanges that I hold coins or dollars. 
@_date: 2013-03-09 15:03:14
This is definitely something to consider. Our SLOWEST days on pizza, gifts, and hotelsforcoins are the days that the exchange rate jumps. Cause people second guess their spending and hold onto it. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 18:43:30
I love how all you redditors believe it when you have heard it from "a guy who runs a bitcoin exchange" but when the actual notice comes out from the horses mouth "china government" everybody acts like it wasn't a huge deal.

If they are serving US customers they are going to end up with the same legal concerns Satoshidice faced. Satoshi dice was smart and did their research on the topic and realized that gambling websites violate us laws so they did the mature thing and stopped. Fly by night operations thinking they can circumvent the law contribute negatively to bitcoins stance with the law.

I dunno what the deal is. Dwolla has a chargeback policy which allows customers to file a claim and get their money returned to their account. This policy is available for I BELIEVE 30 days, hence the 30 day waiting period.... 
If I was a company, I would not allow customers to pull money out for 30 days either unless I had a copy of a government issued ID and verification of residence, just like GOX. Its just too risky from a business standpoint... That being said, I love campbx, just wish they could figure out how to speed up their servers. lol. 
They are in FULL compliance with all rules and regulations in the USA which is what is important to me. I don't want my funds disappearing one day and I feel safe with campbx.

I Agree AND disagree. Bitcoin needs both to suceed. What good is a currency that you can't use to buy things with? Both things need to happen concurrently and luckily I feel that this is on track :) Services are being built, and merchants are beginning to adopt it.

Sweet deal :-)
@_date: 2013-12-19 15:06:14
Hmm, I have chase myself. Maybe this will happen today, lol. That would make sense, if I was target the first stop after the police would be the credit card companies saying "whatever cost it is to send out new cards to everybody do it and ill pay" best step to avoid a lawsuit. Lol
But the card companies probably would do it no matter who's paying so they don't have to deal with fraud charges. 
Interesting stuff. 
@_date: 2013-02-05 15:41:43
The purpose is for people who already have bitcoins to be able to use them on something they can have in there hand physically within an hour which is unheard of in bitcoins. Sure, to use usd, it costs less and saves you a small amount of time,but the point is that this allows you to use bitcoins and bypass the use of USD entirely. Typically to turn bitcoins to usd it takes minimum of 2 days and a wire fee. This allows you to pay in bitcoin directly. 
Bitcoin will not survive without there being things to spend you bitcoins on. If you can't spend a currency on things you want, why have it. 
@_date: 2013-12-21 16:50:16
My feeling is that its so slow because they don't have any btc to send you. Sounds to me that a fatal site flaw allowed users to walk off with the entire sites wallet without even performing a hack...
So I wouldn't quite call it that they've been hacked... They were just stupid and gave all the btc to the wrong people. Lol
This is just speculation but it is educated speculation based upon all the posts I have seen here recently about their issues. 
@_date: 2013-10-12 13:55:16
I am totally not understanding why you guys would be "sketched out". 
Its very simple really, they obviously have had fraud happen and have been stuck receiving a payment reversal after they have already sent coins out. 
YES, bank transfers ARE reversible contrary to peoples beliefs. 
They are not asking for you to pay with a credit card. They simply want an EXTRA backup protection so that if the SH Hits the fan, they have at least ONE level of protection extra to help them. Sure, maybe the credit card could be bad, but its better then nothing. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:45:03
It will get picked up eventually. I had one be stuck like that for around 6 hours. I got a little worried, but once you get 1 confirmation, you are golden. :) This is exactly why the Devs are looking into ways to have a "floating" transaction fee. I read that they are looking into having the fee be based on what "others" are doing in there transaction fees, and estimating the appropriate amount.

people arent sending this guy there private keys. They are sending him wallets that are not accessible, meaning they can't get in, and nobody else has been able to get in. 
At that point what are you options?? You can just forget it and figure the money is lost, or you can take your chances that this guy can crack it for you. And if he steals it... then he steals it I guess.... but you didn't have access to it anyways, so whats the difference. 
This guy has been not only able to get these wallets decrypted, but he has been able to be **trusted** and send the funds back to the rightful owner.

Thanks, this has been a request by many in the past. We will continue to see what we can do about it. Other countries have been difficult to say the least and its upsetting when we spend months negotiating and pre-buying "blocks" of pre-paid credit with the companies and get no customers.
For example we offer australia ordering after having had LOTS of requests... its been a month and a half and not ONE order from australia has come in. This was over a $1500 USD investment for us to add australia. 
As stated in the post, we do listen to our customers. :)

Keep supporting our services so we can expand :) 
Thank you to ALL of our customers and supporters. We are working VERY hard to bring this service to you. 
Though many of you have cringed at the fact that we make a couple dollars from the order, you have NO idea what work we have put into this. HOURS UPON HOURS of building the site, not to mention, we are standing by ALL day to answer questions, verify orders, and answer emails. Our customer service is available from 8AM PST to 1AM PST. We only are only NOT available from 1am to 8am (7 hours) Because we are sleeping. With an average of 2-4 orders a day, at 2 bucks an order, that's a whopping 8 dollars a day as payment for our services. It is BARELY worth a free lunch per day for all of our effort HOWEVER, we are not doing it necessarily to get rich. We are hoping to help strengthen and further the bitcoin economy. :) 
Would we like to be making money off this, of course we would! But for now, it is an experiment and our contribution to the bitcoin marketplace.

As the web designer/developer of pizzaforcoins.com, I am glad to say you don't have anything to worry about regarding that. lol. We are just two guys trying to make the pizza for bitcoins dream a reality for everybody to enjoy.  
We have received carryout orders, so they didn't have to give an address. Just make sure if you DO make that kind of order, that you at least put the address of the store you are going to pick it up from as "your address" or it gets difficult for us to process on our end. Dont just do bogus addresses. lol.

hmmm, I am sorry that you lost your 120.95 HOWEVER, I think this is one of the following:
-Maybe you gave them the wrong address... in which case, tough luck... its not their fault if you gave them the wrong address.
-Maybe you are not understanding how they sent the coins to you in an email. 
-Maybe they have you mixed up with another customer
I HIGHLY doubt these guys are trying to scam you. They are a legit company, they are licensed in 30 states as a money transmitter, registered federally, and trying to dot all their I's and cross their T's. Keep on them, I think they are just swamped with business.

It's been very rare and usually very brief. I'd say in one year bitpay has only been inaccessible 2 times of periods less then 2 hours each. 
There have been many "error times" though. Meaning that the IPN (instant payment notifications to my server) were not going out, emails were not going out, etc, etc. those times have only ever amounted to 10-15 times in the last year and same thing, they lasted an hour or less. 
Keep in mind these are the times I noticed. There may have been more at other times. 
Don't get me wrong, bitpay is doing an awesome job keeping up. I am just stating the facts. Tony is **TOP NOTCH** and runs a amazing business. 
One issue I have that I would like to see implemented as a new feature is refunds. If a customer paid in bitcoin, and they request a refund in a certain timeframe &lt; 5 hours or something, I should be able to give it to them without having to get hit with the 1% transaction fee. For example, if a customer pays 1 coin for merchandise and then asks for a refund 10 minutes later, I send them. 1 coin back. But bitpay still takes 0.01 coins as a fee so I only get 0.99 coins for a sale that I did not even get.. My company just eats the loss, but it should not have to be that way.  If that makes sense. Haha. 
@_date: 2013-03-09 15:05:21

Not for normal products for a simple hair cut. He means for the hair if somebody is getting hair extensions, for the dye that he is using to dye your hair, etc... 
If you are just going in for a simple hair cut, you won't be expected to be paying for the gel he puts in your hair. But if you go in for a 1000 dollar hair extension job, that has 500 dollars in hair, he wants usd payment for the hair itself.

This is true. I made no argument of cash vs bitcoin. I'm simply stating bitcoin security towards credit card security. 
Obviously the advantage over cash is that bitcoin is digital like credit cards but still secure like cash. 
@_date: 2013-02-05 05:19:27
not paid with a credit card because then the customer would have the ability to tip on the reciept in WHATEVER amount they felt like writing in and we would be charged it. We are currently working on implementing a tipping module to allow tip to be added to your order on our site and paid with in btc. :) Then no USD will be involved at all.

We got the same type of "coinbase" spam emails to our "AdminATpizzaforcoins.com" email address and that address does NOT HAVE A COINBASE ACCOUNT.

Upon receiving order we queue up the order and initiate the one time use payments to protect our financial information. Upon recieving partial confirmation, usually within 10 minutes, we place the order. While there is a small amount of time added due to the confirmation requirement, we keep it at the minimum possible to keep your order as fast as possible. On most delivery orders, we have had reports of under 1 hour from placing order on our site, till delivery man rings your door bell.

As stated above, we have had over 600 customers, never one complaint. We have 2 people on call at all times. And it is mostly automatic, we just need a human to give a final "okay" to push the order through as "finished"

Never seen that project before but I will always link to it and tell people about it. In my opinion we need a combination of both off chain transactions as well as a slightly increased block size. 
The biggest blockchain space wasters should be the first to be looking into offchain options. If everybody does there part to conserve space, we can make this happen. 
If you look at the busiest addresses, they are all from gambling. The gambling sites need to step up and address this. Even small cut backs will help.
