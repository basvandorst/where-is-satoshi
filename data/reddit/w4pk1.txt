even if they get funds back,  they are GOXED,  no COLD wallet?
is this some kind of joke?  let me repeat  NO COLD WALLET.
what is wrong with you morons?  I dont care what mumbo jumbo multi sig spin you talk,  NO COLD WALLET, who handling 60 million of BTC does NOT have a cold wallet?  Does the bank put 60 millon of cash at the front counter? DUH!!!  
you deserve to be out of business,  not a resume building item either.
morons, no cold wallet..  unbelievable.

something like this is invariably an inside job.  obviously they were waiting for the right moment ,  the typhoon for example.
I would be taking a real close look at all the internal actors at this time.
as for not having a COLD wallet locked away in a vault,   the mind boggles at the stupidity.

@_date: 2017-02-21 11:49:39
here is the logic,   if you own 17 bitcoins and only 21 million will ever be created then only 1,350,000 people on the planet will own more than you
we all know at least 2 million are lost so the number falls down to 1,117,000
last count there are 7.5 Billion people on the planet
sell?  sell when 1 BTC = 1 million dollars.

SEC head has left and there is an undertaker in charge until new boss is confirmed,  most likely after march 11th.
I think it is quite likely no decision will be announced and on March 12th we will have an ETF.
This way if it BTC craters in the future there is no one to point a finger at and whose head will roll.
This is one of those Jesus moments,  where the SEC can make the decision as a GO and wash it's hands from it  at the same time.

if you have miners at home point away from chinese pools ASAP.

What these two sides do is irrelevant,  no one side is going to get 95%  EVER. Unless they sit in a room and figure it out. 
At the end of the day,  at this stage Bitcoin is going to outlive everyone.

@_date: 2017-04-11 13:21:45
watching this parameter closely will be an early indicator.
last 144 blocks we are at 45.8%  not a trivial number as it is.
and, there might be existing "allies"  "swtiching" and thus not affecting the aggregate hash power as much, so this parameter will tell the story.
   
@_date: 2017-04-11 15:57:13
right,  so if Bitmain is highly leveraged turning their advantage off would be suicide, therefore the only option they have is to press on with an attack.
hence, their irrational behaviour to avoid loosing their advantage, this hole they have dug is too far gone to come out of.
think of Bitmain as the Volkswagen of miners....

the best option is to HOLD, and to hold in cold storage. 
I too would have been 5 BTC ahead had I just held.
Trading on an exchange is not much different than gambling in a casino. I think it is worse, your casino chips are not under threat of being stolen (while at the casino anyway). 
I had my BTC in cold storage,  but the big problem is there is,  it is just sitting there, doing nothing,  look at the exchanes and you can lend your BTC for some pretty juicy interest, so I thought I would take a chance and lend my BTC. Sure it was great for a while, but when you look at those candles dancing up and down the way they do , you think, HEY that could be me shorting ETH and it falling 14% or holding XRP and up it goes 20% . 
Listen to me now and hear me later, YOU cannot beat the market, let alone the crypto market. It cannot be done. I shorted, I held ,I sold, I went margin long and short, I got margin called, I lost 40% of my BTC, I went in further to recover losses,  I bet it all in and got lucky, got back what I lost + a little. Could easily have lost another 40%.  I am glad I did it, because I never ever want to have that feeling again. 
Second problem, so I have decided hold for good , now I am trying to get my BTC out, the exchange took my 18BTC no problem,  try getting it out, geting verified takes weeks , and even then I dont want to give them my social security number , so it will take 12 days to take my BTC out 1.45 every 24 hours,  so now gain, my BTC is sitting there and the candles are dancing, so easy to try and catch a big wave and make MORE BTC,  the echanges know this,  that is why it is so hard to get the BTC out.
so a note of advice,  HODL your BTC,  it is soo easy, so easy to gamble it , trade it, scam it, have it stollen etc etc away,  it is so fluid, just litttle numbers,  blink and they are gone.
if you must trade, trade smart,  stick to BTC, ETH and XRP only,  these are real world appications in use today so there is something there, if you end up loosing on them there is a good chance they will recover some time into the future, at least you still have something,  do not watch by the second (very very hard to do), go on margin with CAUTION,  the lending fees add up fast. Sometimes I think it is better just to roll satoshibones dice instead, at least the odds are plain to see.
HODL HODL HODL.

I think the Chinese governement is behind him, this way they either get to own Bitcoin block chaain,  or spin their own Chinese version that they can controll.

I have always said ,  although it is now getting harder and harder  but still withing reach
get 1 bitcoin,  you will be one of 21 million on the PLANET out of 7 billion people to own one.
actually even less,  I think 2 million coins are lost forever

@_date: 2017-05-02 10:50:14
dont waste your time,  I waited 3 weeks,and then asked them to escalate   and then another 2 weeks after until they told me the wanted my SIN or passport ID which would have taken another x amount of weeks. LIke I am going to give them my SIN or passport ID,  pretty sure they know that too. Their wholes system is to take the BTC in and make it as hard as possible to move it out. So while you are "waiting" with YOUR BTC sitting there you end up trading and loosing.
5 min to move it in and it took me 18 days to move my BTC out 1.5 a day.  I wanted ot lend my BTC , but frankly Polo is too much risk, I was undecided until the experience I had with them.
my advice, stay far far away from Polo or any other exchange for that mater.
@_date: 2017-05-02 15:00:40
their cold wallet seems healthy
but with bitcoin even the smallest whiff of a fire should be enough to get the hell out.
ofcourse no wants to take a 10% haircut getting out but better that the alternatives....

@_date: 2017-05-25 12:11:17
yeah I hear you , I have benethere too,  but set your self a goal achieve it and stick to it 
my goal was to always own 21 bitcoin,  nothing else mattered, i scraped and worked for 4 years to chieve 16
but I could see there is no way to reach the 21,  so I started trading my 16 , it has been the most stressfull 2 weeks of my life, was down to 12 at one point,  got margin called (on ripple no less) , up and down , once you start trading you have to detach and just look at the numbers,  if you think of value lost you are lost.
I remember when i finaly breached 21, juimped and shouted, and yet greed took over and I continued to trade, even after all the stress to get to 21, went bellow 21, and the cycle to ge get back to my goal repeated,  
finaly got up to 21.5 and that is when I said STOP,  and still the greed is calling, look at the alts drive,  buy at the bottom now and your bitcoin stack will get even LARGER.  I know it for what it is now,  pure greed, I never thought I had so much greed in me.
The bottom line is, once you decide to trade your BTC you might as well play satoshibones,  UNLESS you have balls of steel and know excatly what you are doing AND even then never never go all in.
@_date: 2017-05-04 18:45:43

Bitcoin legal tender in Japan is what is going on,  217 million people , one of the ritchest nations in the world.
we all know the Japanese penchant for new technology and technology fads,  if the Japanese decide bitcoin is the $shit en masse bitcoin will go  to $20k easy.
folks there are only 16 million bitcoins in existance, maybe much less woth all the ones lost foreever.
that is what is going on.

@_date: 2017-06-23 13:10:33
correct,  5% daily equates to 2BTC return on 25BTC loan
so I will take the one sided 5% return on a polo leveraged loan, 
lowest risk to earn that kind of BTC imho.

I trade on Poloniex  ,  set up account,  move btc in  ,  shorting involves trading on margin,  I just make sure I trade on margin, but by reserve is always 200% of my margin trade so I can wait.
