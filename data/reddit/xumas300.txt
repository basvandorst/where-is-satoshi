You never know it's an investment! If we knew when it will go up and down we would be billionaires! 
Please make sure your mom understands its an investment. LOSS OR WIN. Both are possible.

BitStamp/Kraken. Only 0.25% fee

Yeah, I honestly have no idea myself if I want to HODL or just sell and see what happens. Worst thing is that the futures are cash settled and therefore manipulation is possible.

Price will not crash this time. You guys are forgetting a couple things.
1. FUTURES NEXT WEEK: Banks are buying now to pump the price, so that they can bet next that the price will go down.
2. LIGHTNING NETWORK BREAKTHROUGH YESTERDAY: 
3. WHO ARE THE BITCOIN INVESTORS: Amateur investors! No broker or bank advisor will help them on this point. People are on their own. They see the charts and see it rising. SURE, some people will sell, but those who really makes a difference is the extremely rich. and they are greedy and will HODL to the very end.
I expect a correction after CME future launch and for a bearish market afterwards.

Yes but exchange rates tend to be fair with the bank. They fuck you over when you use ATM though.
And yes that 0.25% is for withdrawal of BTC to USD/EUR in bank.

The establishments will be betting on the downfall of this price by currently pumping the price, by increasing demand with buying bitcoins. And attempt to cause fear at the same time.
Then they plan to SELL ALL BITCOINS at the same time to, dump the price and hope the fear and dump will be enough.
I don't think it is in the long run.
