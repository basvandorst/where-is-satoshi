Everyone handles things differently, obviously if you stay in a toxic environment it’s going to be counter productive to your healing. I know plenty of people with severe ptsd who have been helped with their situations through PROPER therapy not just a person saying take two of these a day you’ll be fine

So do you guys assume all rich people get kidnapped and beaten for money? Or do you plan on never showing you have any wealth (expensive car, house or clothing) ? 
Although the shirt itself is cringe worthy lol 
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:08:06
It could mean that, but never once have I seen someone in an expensive car or house &amp; thought “that person is in a lot of debt”. Maybe a cheap car that someone tried to make look expensive with rims and etc though.

Well you can’t change how successful your family is lol, but you can change who you allow in your life. If you weren’t money exchanging close prior to it, I don’t see why you should change because “you got it” now, unless you sincerely just wanted to help someone.

Terrible but atleast you’ve learned your lesson, friends a family have been the downfall of more people who get newfound wealth than anything. Probably has a name like lottery winner syndrome lol. Celebrities and athletes always deal with it, people all of a sudden feel entitled because you have money or that because you have some relation to them that you should look out for them now. The way I rationalize things is I didn’t put any of them in their financial circumstances it’s not my position to take care of things even if it was an emergency because if they had no knowledge of my wealth they would not expect or come to me for the same situation, only children and Whoever raised you/helped you in life in a way you feel is repayable, do I believe should be on a give away money list not just because so and so is your bestie or your brother/sister who probably aren’t as close as many believe to be lol. 
But maybe I’m an asshole now and don’t believe in just handouts when it’s so easy now days to make money even without a legit JOB or career

I never understood this mentality, of getting money and not being able to enjoy your financial freedom however you want without the whole giving them money thing maybe it’s because I don’t have a heart of gold but i personally know when i came into large sums keep money I set a line that the only person I’m obligated to look out for is my daughter and I, anyone extra is by my choice not by they persons situation that if they did not know I have money they wouldn’t have expected any sort of help for myself. If a person has a problem with you because you don’t help them imo that makes it easy to cut them out of your life and if you have to give money to keep them satisfied you’re basically paying them to be your family or friends 
Maybe rambling, I just hate the whole family or friends wanting your money when you make it scenario and people not being able to stand up for themselves/not give away their money, the most I deal with are the little jokes I get every now and then because I own a 18 Porsche Panamera turbo so they might say “you got it” when something comes up even if it’s the price of a burger and i just say  Wesley snipes had it too lol(he ended up broke in jail at one point from tax evasion)

Yeah I guess that’s understandable but it’s also how people end up giving away it all and other family issues as 200k to your sister but only 100k to parents and 20k to grandmother can create a wtf thing and then a dependency from your sister as she now knows she has a super security blanket over herself. I’m all for helping as I personally paid of some debts for close person but that’s opening up a can of worms and I wouldn’t do it if it wasn’t for someone I’ve tried helping out prior to the extra money. It sounds selfish but it’s your money and even if it doesn’t feel like you worked hard for it you did by making whatever decisions and giving it away is lessening your opportunity to be able to not have to do as much work in your future or your own families if you chose to create one

Understandable from your perspective, as long as you’re happy at the end of the day.

Although I’m heavily into btc, one thing I don’t feel like people take into account with these comparisons is how different things are. From contracts, to purposely attacking and trying to draw people away from btc, along with in the times that BTC prices were so lovely, it was used to buy other crypto. Now exchanges are starting to make more and more options for usd to other currencies making it less of a necessity to get btc as it was in past. 
I’m definitely hoping some of these big predictions are true, but with how much things have changed since the good old days I’m optimistic about the ranges peaking so high. 
Unless like Apple or some big company comes out with backing btc

I’m not defending coinbase.... I’m talking about the fact that if he wants to SUPPORT THE STREAMER with crypto he either needs to ask for their address like I mentioned, or pay on the streaming programs that he’s unfortunately use coinbase, but he’s not personally supporting them. 
I might not support a president but that’s not going to stop me from buying government stocks or etc. 
The simple solution is sent to their address and it won’t be connected to coinbase. They just happen to be the most convenient and accessible option out there and if we are being real, if coinbase fails crypto would fail usa wise(at least until other places come along that people trust and know about, like robinhood not being so selective on who gets in) although I see it as impossible(coinbase failing anytime soon)

Discounts by merchants is one big reason, then rebuy the bitcoin. I get 20% off on a certain site paying in bitcoin and some sports books do 100% deposit bonuses for btc etc. 
They’d have to do something that makes the use over normal $ sound more reasonable though as you mentioned it’s become an investment to some instead of actual use 
@_date: 2018-07-20 21:02:19
You’re not supporting coinbase though you’re supporting the streamer.. I’m sure you could just ask one to send you their btc address and donate to them through there if you’re that adamant against using the processes that are convenient for them and attached to streams to be able to let others know they received it
@_date: 2018-07-30 01:43:08
More people don’t care about that who buy it, than there is people who do. All they know is it’s easy and convenient to buy on there, they don’t have some grand plan  of keeping forever until it’s a viable currency for any object it’s until they have enough Cash from it now to sell and withdraw.
Not saying any of that’s right, only saying the reasons why people would buy with robinhood 
@_date: 2018-07-21 01:10:41
I have a feeling you don’t understand what the OP is talking about... donating to streamers on twitch is supported through apps that are partnered with coinbase. He wants to donate to the streamer with crypto but not support coinbase(the apps are linked through coinbase), which his only option would be sending directly to persons address so that it’s or through coinbase or he will have to send through stream which will be linked through coinbase.. 
I’m not talking about him buying btc with coinbase 
@_date: 2018-07-21 20:23:26
Most people aren’t actually doing anything with their crypto(in the sense of buying things with it) so it’s not much different outside of not having the security of a wallet. Can still sell into usd and withdraw just as most people do
@_date: 2018-07-14 14:52:48
Not everyone uses Reddit to see the postings over and over... take a chill pill lmao 
@_date: 2018-07-29 20:18:17
I mean yeah if you believe that a major organization like robinhood is going to do that to you and not be held responsible, you’d like not use robinhood in the first place if you had that paranoia lol. 
I personally use it because I can make trades without being charged anything, and put my dividend profits from stocks into btc. Stocks are held on there too, which maybe is lol the same thing as buying btc on there to other people. 
I won’t have more btc then I care to lose on there though lol but that’s because I know of hardware wallets as most don’t.

It’s just the shitty way things work. My state tries to tax me almost 6k a year for owing my vehicle, meanwhile it’s like 3k a year in another state, what did the state or government do to get some of that. 
Hopefully things can get to the point you don’t need to withdraw in usd, or some absurd cash amount gift cards start being buyable 
@_date: 2018-07-21 01:23:39
No, that’s a donation page, that’s not donating through the stream that’s no different than sending to his btc address. 
@_date: 2018-07-29 19:05:59
Gives more people access to being able to purchase bitcoin, not everyone who buys, sells or sends it or even uses it for transitions. Most people don’t even know about offline wallets.

I created a pax full account and never used it, but I have received an email that someone attempted to login to my account. Likely a site database compromised and people tried the information on btc sites. 
I had one of my sports booking accounts hacked before and the hacker then tried to see if I had a coinbase with same information
