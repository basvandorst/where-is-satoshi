Every ICO gives like 5x minimum, that's not an argument.
Anyway, good luck. No point arguing with someone with his head so far up his ass he can't understand another point of view.

Everybody managed to get at least a 10x increase minimum if they started in April so don't act like you know the markets. It's next to impossible to time the markets, and your rudimentary understanding of support and resistance, as well as your obvious lack of understanding of technical analysis shows that you indeed know nothing about this market. 
You'll get burned out when BTC has a massive correction. You're not some saint who managed to outsmart the market, you're just lucky you're seeing mass adoption. This is simply gambling - call it whatever you want. 
I swear, the confirmation bias and survivorship bias in this subreddit is getting out of hand.

TA shows that we are likely out of the downtrend and 12.5k is the next target. It was likely that we would have experienced a 2500 drop, which we did (2700). 
All values are in USD. I think it was a bad time to convert to fiat. Just hodl. Most traders end up losing anyway, and have 100x the stress.

If they were to indeed hold and delete the private keys, then the price of BTC would increase, due to the diminishing supply, as long as the demand is still there. Holding the BTC does nothing for them, as not many people will be spending their BTC on Microsoft products specifically. 
Lots of people entering the market are simply hodling, and not spending, due to the potential for making more.

AAAAAND I'm done with bitcoin. We've peaked boys, we'll never break 11.5k anymore.

Walls mean nothing. As a trader who has been in this market for years, this could have gone either way really. I don't think you're trading, considering you're looking at sell walls as resistance, and buy walls as support. 
It is more than obvious that you simply got lucky with that 6% ish run. You're not trading my friend, you're simply gambling. 
If you were trading, you would be using indicators to know when to enter and exit a trade. If you really were to "follow your instincts" you're gambling, and advocating gambling to others that watch this.
Remember, most day traders lose, and HODLing is always the best way to make money, as well as diversification.
