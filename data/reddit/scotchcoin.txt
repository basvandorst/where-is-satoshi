Its unfortunate but necessary, processing fees pay his salary. Porn is the killer app though.

Have you ever randomly sampled call records for a call center? I've done several hundred hours worth. You would be shocked at what a $12 an hour front line rep will say. I've heard guys try to have phone sex with girls that are calling in about problems with their laptop.

Re-read my post. At first he acted like he did not know anything about bitcoin. I told him to go to this website and I would show him. Then he all of the sudden he had heard of bitcoin. When I asked him if he knew what it was he was like "yyeeaap" in a "been talking about it all day" kind of way.  My point is, you are correct the person I talked to was not their bitcoin processor, nor were they going to be. They did not like this.

Thanks treemunk!

Thanks, I tried support but it bounced back. If you have another one that would be great. I can guarantee you that the billing company knows of bitcoin. Not only did he end up admitting that he knew what it was after he said "I am not aware of bitcoin", I seriously doubt I am the only person calling their customer support line asking about bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-16 05:56:43
I emailed support no response. How did you contact them?
@_date: 2014-02-16 04:52:47
I called them and spoke with a rep. Yes, I went to the signup page in the reddit thread I linked to.

Dude said "I am not aware of bitcoin". Then 30 seconds later said yeah he knows about bitcoin. Do you really not think this company specializes in porn billing? Do you think their management does not understand the implication of bitcoin being widely accepted on porn sites?

Lots of call centers record every call. Not many listen to every call.  Reps know this.  
After thinking about more, they do the billing for many of Brazzer's websites. A bunch of people have probably been calling them with "Hey I heard you guys accept bitcoin but I don't see it on xyz.com  (some brazzer website). How do I sign up?" These people do not know of IKnowThatGirl.com.  
It does them absolutely NO good to say, "yeah thats a trial of a new payment method only found on IKnowThatGirl.com. Follow these instructions to do business with our competitor".  
Better to just deny, deny, deny. If someone brings up IKnowthatgirl.com specifically, say yes, you are aware of it but push towards methods they do accept.  At this point though the rep is basically caught in a lie. During my call this is when the rep's attitude changed to "yeah... I'm over this already"

Just saw the email I sent bounced back. Not sure what to think now...
@_date: 2014-02-16 05:42:20
I called the number listed on their website and connected to the billing department. Yes it was the wrong call center. I'm also pretty confident it will get sorted out once I can get in touch with the right people. However, if you call 1-877-271-6422, you will have a similar conversation. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 06:58:49
lol, didn't read your user name until now. Trolling must be a hobby for you. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 06:52:44
You're the one making the accusation. Lets talk shop. I've got the flu, I can talk call centers all night. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 06:15:09


He actually wasn't even trying to wrap up the call. I did.  


Somebody over there does.
@_date: 2014-02-16 05:27:18
Call 1-877-271-6422 and tell them you paid with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 06:30:00
Really. I run several call centers. Teach me about how tier 1 should work.
@_date: 2014-02-16 05:50:28
Thanks to the link to I'll PM him. If you check out his recent post history, you'll see the link to the iknowthatgirl.com signup page with bitcoin. I think at this point they are just testing the waters and havent released it on brazzers.com.
@_date: 2014-02-16 19:57:45
Yep. He knew he was caught in a lie.   
"I am not aware of bitcoin"  
"ok, go to this page"  
"I know the page"  
"So you know of bitcoin"  
"Yeah"  
--Awkward pause--  
"I'll bet management has been telling you to not talk about bitcoin and to deny it even fucking exists"  
"yeah basically"
