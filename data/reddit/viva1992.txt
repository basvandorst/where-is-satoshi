Of course no one knows. But if you believe in bitcoin's (&amp; the blockchain's) potential, and that it's scaling issues will eventually be solved, you are better off holding to your coins. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:01:03
I gotcha, clever actually ;)

There will only ever be 21 million *mined*

Bitcoin is FULL of weak hands right now looking to make a quick buck. Not sure how that relates to the numerous posts which look like they have been written by middle schoolers though
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:56:00
Wallet is safer. If you don't hold your own private keys, you don't really own your bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:27:21
Haha good one, as if I ever invested anything I wasn't willing to lose
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:02:05
LOL this is basically every second /new post
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:36:44
Go for it man, but don't try to convince a veteran hodler over here ;)
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:36:01
Have you been through 2013? Same exact situation. The best advice back then, like today, is to just hold for the long term. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:04:32
I don't doubt that; and I would agree with you that those people are better off selling their BTC and look for other opportunities 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:25:33
Totally agree with the idea that a correction for BTC is healthy right now. Too many weak hands in the game. Take it from someone who has been through the 2013 crash; this is good for bitcoin in the long term.

I think there's a great opportunity for paypal to become a "trusted" third-party escrow service for Bitcoin transactions - why compete with bitcoin when you can profit from it?
@_date: 2017-11-21 02:10:29
I find it fascinating that Reddit looked exactly the same 7 years ago as it does today
@_date: 2013-12-02 12:54:52
I suppose blockchain.info requires a minimum fee of 0.0001 BTC even if I put in 0 for the miners fee. weird.
@_date: 2013-12-11 04:58:30
What about a bitcoin services review site?
@_date: 2013-12-11 04:56:42
Idea: an online log/database that lists those companies? Or some sort of bitcoin services review site
@_date: 2013-12-10 11:46:46
Exactly, so be careful. They even have a dedicated support twitter account  (smart move of them to grab that name while they could) but even they've been ignoring my simple requests for help
@_date: 2013-12-02 13:18:33
no worries, thanks anyway
@_date: 2013-12-23 08:23:39
Man even their fees are better than Cavirtex...
@_date: 2013-12-10 19:04:06
5th time now &amp; despite them actually asking ppl to contact them if they have troubles... I dont know anymore
@_date: 2013-12-01 13:10:04
blog about it and share on your social networks? I can if you guys want me to
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:46:20
Holy cow... and all I have is 1 BTC :'(
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:49:29
Thanks for the advice &amp; sounds very cool, let us know!
@_date: 2013-11-23 07:02:05
What you have to realize is many businesses actually convert BTC back into fiat immediately and thus negate any risks from bitcoin losing its value!
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:31:44
Is there a cheaper way to sell not using CAVIRTEX? Considering apparently both of us bought our btc's there
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:41:31
it's more affordable for people living in the US for example since their USD can buy more YUAN. 
And typically no, prices don't change all the time or in "real time" and when a currency is "weak" we are talking about tiny changes, cents maybe, and that wouldn't matter much if you are buying one lamp in China for 1,99 yuan as a consumer. However, if you import lamps from China in huge loads like 10,000 lamps just a 5 cent weaker yuan would equate to large savings for importers.

Interesting. Did he never say how he tried to contact you? he surely must have had your twitter handle that was connected to your account.
I'm dealing with the new Manager now I guess. Doesn't seem like much has changed anyway, still being ripped off. That's why I want people to know about this so it doesn't happen to them
@_date: 2013-12-02 12:58:33
that's what I thought, but blockchain.info won't let me send 0.005  BTC, it gives me this error message 
@_date: 2013-11-22 15:31:14
As mentioned, China's economy is heavily export-focused. A weak national currency (relatively speaking) is excellent for those economies since their goods are now more affordable for other countries to buy. Germany is another example of an export-driven country, the weak Euro lately has been pretty beneficiary for the German economy
@_date: 2013-12-10 11:37:54
Yeah I know, I actually waited till the blockchain showed me that it was confirmed 6 times, but it still showed me an error. Their service probably even works, it's just that they are ignoring me apparently because I want to withdraw my BTC. What kind of customer service is that? What if I deposited much more money with them? It's ridiculous 
@_date: 2013-12-10 13:23:40
I should have, my stupidity. I thought I was indirectly supporting a Bitcoin start-up. 
@_date: 2013-12-22 10:45:50
The above is true, they eventually did get back to me and compensated me.
@_date: 2013-10-21 22:33:10
@_date: 2013-04-08 23:42:45
yeah, but even if so that will take a long time of them trying everything to drive bitcoin down first before "giving up"
@_date: 2013-04-08 22:55:46
Ebay won't happen just because their owners are the same who founded paypal, and paypal is a direct competitor to bitcoin
@_date: 2013-12-10 19:25:13
so is 
Posted a thread about them here 
@_date: 2013-04-09 07:40:39
VirtEx Canada vs Blockchain.info
@_date: 2013-12-02 13:10:46
I definitely didn't configure one, I chose custom transaction and put in 0 for the miner fee specifically 
@_date: 2013-04-09 16:37:13
Sorry I meant to write smaller than 1BTC.
Great advice, Thanks! 
@_date: 2013-11-10 14:55:18
oh I missed that, very relevant thread
