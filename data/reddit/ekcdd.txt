Sure, we dont have to be enemies but they make /rbitcoin and Bitcoin into some kind of evil entity.
Ideally it would be great if the community would get along and work together.
@_date: 2019-08-10 05:48:08
They should mine empty blocks on bcash and sell bch for bitcoin.
Even though they could do this they haven't. Shows how evil block stream is. /s
@_date: 2019-08-24 06:38:43
You should go on their website now and click the "buy bitcoin" button. It defaults to bch.

I remember drawing these in primary school in the back on my school book... Damn that makes me feel old.

They need more decimal places next step is 69.6969

This is a petty and childish thing to say. The fact you think that a man and a woman cannot work together without having a romantic relationship is absurd and sexist. Even if they were it's none of your business what they do in their private lives.  
Also posted this elsewhere and got downvoted... go figure.

They are pretty cocky about this over in but it's only a small dip and i have seen way worse.
No doubt it will correct itself and any gains alt coins have on bitcoin will be reversed.
The main thing is not to panic and dont sell if the prices drops.
@_date: 2019-08-14 08:47:37
I think if you bought at that price you are doing well. If it dropped to 1k  I would sell as it's going down and buy at the bottom and wait for the price to go up, which is will always will at some point you just need patience.

I'm glad to see who didn't win but how can he pay for the 50% to Kleinman? I thought he couldn't provide the private keys? I doubt his buddy Calvin will give him that sort of cash he sure as hell wouldn't have it either.
@_date: 2019-08-24 16:17:42
He's not broke because he lies and convinces people to using his services.

Is [localbitcoins.com]( still A thing? also try search for Bitcoin ATMs (they do charge a little more then say exchanges) you can use [ to find them.

Yeah alts, how do you like those apples.

What's Thailand like for crypto adoption?
I ask because I am going there and paying in crypto seems so much easier than converting my fiat to their fiat (plus cheaper).

If satoshi signed a message with the genesis block with a message that said  "I am not Craig Wright" I would be more inclined to believe it to be legitimate.
@_date: 2019-10-21 15:58:58
Or massive inflation.

I go to for the laughs, some of the stuff that comes out of their mouths is hilarious. Like cash being more green than Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-10-21 10:09:41
Bitcoin Cash.

I could help but picture Craig saying this as I read it.
@_date: 2019-10-21 10:15:45
That's why I don't think such a feat is even possible on BTC. 16% is something like 20 odd exahashes  and turning off mining - especially that much hash power would be cause a massive loss in profit in mining. Their DAA makes it much much more easier to pull off due to the constantly changing difficulty (every block.)
I don't think it's impossible, it's just a lot more money and hash power would need to go into it to make it work and you would be much better off just mining for those 1000 blocks.
@_date: 2019-10-21 15:57:50
They cherry pick what  stuff of Satoshi's  to follow. But *BTC doesn't follow Satoshi's white paper* and we'll change one of the most important mechanics  of Bitcoin (The DAA) - One that  has *empirical*  evidence to show it has worked well for 10 years.  
Honestly, I could go on forever....
@_date: 2019-10-21 12:21:04
I think using the same DAA as Bitcoin would have helped the situation and the impact would have been way less severe.
I think they would rather die a slow and painful death before they use Bitcoin to help secure their network. After all, they are the REAL Bitcoin, right?
@_date: 2019-12-28 15:53:55
Wouldn't you still have to pay network fees still? They only took maybe 100 sats at most and what I paid may have been just the network fees and they took nothing.

I'm weening my self off  Coinbase.  Not because it's bad - it has been probably the best exchange I have used and there are MANY dodgy exchanges - trust me I know, but because I wanted to control the private keys instead of putting all my trust into coinbase.
@_date: 2019-12-28 15:18:01
Coinbase fees are always higher than usual so I probably could have pay less if I was using a proper wallet and probably would have went down to maybe a cent in USD.
I'm sure they would come with some ridiculous reason or just  call me a troll or a paid socket puppet - and I wish I was paid to say Bitcoin was great , but I do it for free.

Your comment made me think of the Simpsons episode that was a spoof of Harry Potter.

The right is how see segwit, the left is the rest of the world
@_date: 2019-12-28 16:50:25
That's why I don't post. If what you are saying doesn't fit their narrative they downvote you and call you a troll.
If you are doing native segwit it is super cheap to transact, people need to stop using the legacy addresses then complaining how high their fees are. Either that or use LN, which is still in development but is making great strides.

The "640k ought to be enough for anybody" is often said to be a quote from Bill Gates but he himself has denied ever saying this. In short it is probably a meme that lost orgins through a game of chinese whispers.

But.. but.. but.. lightning network doesn't work!  
It's good to see the lightning network in action. Can you spend money received as soon as you get it? Sorry if this is a newb question but I don't know a great deal about ln, but I want to learn.
