Are you retarded? "There are no such things as wire transfers " what are you even talking about 
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:12:38
Hey buddy you just go into your bank and give them the info from the Bank Wire deposit page it's that simple. 
Be careful because at the moment their experiencing delays in wire transfers so you'll pay for the wire transfer and might not receive it for up to 3 days. Normal bank transfers are working fine and are free and take 3 to 5 days.

Exactly my point is the numbers very small 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:50:57
You're right the momentum is wiped out considering less then 1 percent of people own bitcoin and also there's still a ton of people that don't even know what it is so yea your right momentum is gone

Well to get a warrant you simply need more evidence then not that a crime is occurring you don’t need solid evidence 
A high electricity bill could easily be demonstrated to a judge as a possible growing operation

Click his profile it says it right at the top
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:42:16
I would but at the rate of transactions you probably won't get it til next week. It'll cost more in fees 
@_date: 2018-02-16 15:36:35
What's your point? I see tiny amounts printed over the span of 2 weeks 
@_date: 2018-02-11 01:28:56
10 days for what? A wire transfer is done same day 
@_date: 2017-10-30 11:19:11
Nah man you misunderstood me even a can understand how western union can be used to scam
What I was saying for the context of this situation is if they send ME the money through WU they can't scam me 
@_date: 2017-10-27 19:29:02
Care to elaborate? 
@_date: 2018-04-09 05:08:22
