Hahaha.. I love it.. I was telling my wife and friends about CC over Thanksgiving and they just looked at me with a blank stare. I then had to show them what it was all about and they started acting like children on Christmas. Of course, the excitement stemmed from me showing them BTC's value. Their minds were absolutely blown and they couldn't comprehend a word I said. 
Anyways, while the girls talked about girl stuff we looked more into bitcoin and alt currencies. We stumbled across Megacoins and we were just flabbergasted at what that community was about. 
To us, this was not about "getting rich" this was about eliminating something that is a perpetuating toxicity. You have a standing invitation if you ever want to come over to the Megacoins board. They have an incredible sense of community, focus and they are extremely genuine in terms of CC. Check them out and here are some coins if you ever want to jump on board! :D

Here's a tip... you fucking leave the wallet alone.. If it isn't yours just carry on about your business. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 15:07:22
Do you find it ironic that Wellsfargo hands out dum dum suckers after every transaction? Do you think they're implicitly calling you a dum dum? 
I hope they don't call you after I give you some megacoins! :D  +$0.25 Megacoins

For the time being I don't know of a multi-functional wallet. However, one of the developers for MEC is trying to deploy a universal wallet. :D I'm not sure when it will happen but there has been talk about it! :D
