Senior-level developer here. 95% of the code I write is "borrowed". You would have to be stupid to reinvent the wheel every time. Not to mention, even if you develop an app you're writing code that executes in an environment that makes up 99% of the actual tech involved. Operating system, hardware drivers, network layers etc... all other people's code you're running to make your app work.

You're either a liar or terribly inefficient.  
  
20 years ago you had to write everything from scratch. Now, everything is already out there on the internet. To not use it is a waste of time.  
  
My employer loves me. Does yours know you're a time waster?

They do have propellers, they're just inside a jet pump. AKA impellers. 
 
  
Still, you don't want to be behind those things when the jet is going. Shit can literally take your skin off.

I thought the miners were just solving mathematical problems. Are you saying the complexity of these problems changes depending on the number of miners? How does the system even know how many miners there are?

Digging through code is way overdue for me, but can you ELI5 this one?

So what you're saying is that essentially the difficulty is agreed upon by the blockchain?  
  
As in, "we just found this block, the next difficulty number based on how fast we found it will be x"?  
  
If so, that makes a lot of sense. Also, that means that bitcoin will never die... it will just eventually get too difficult for people to care.

Have you seen how fast they're making jet ski's lately? My SVHO goes 0-60 in about 3 seconds. You can bet that water PSI will take your skin off. Mine actually has a warning sticker on it that says just that...

"private" currency?
