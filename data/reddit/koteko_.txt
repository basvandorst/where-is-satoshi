This is very cool. Question: why assume the price must grow exponentially?

Ah, I had misread - thanks for clarifying ;)

Don't strawman. There is also non-verbal consent:

You've been answered already, but to reiterate: "asking for permission", in this context, includes verbal and non-verbal clues that, if you truly are surrounded by willing sexual partners like you imply, are understood by all parties involved. It's perfectly fine to do this completely non-verbally, but there is a percentage of risk, eg if you misread their clues and initiate an unwanted sexual act. Hence why the accent is put on "asking", thereby suggesting you vocalise your intentions at least a bit, even if used to not doing so with your paramours.
So yes, yours was a strawman: mirepresenting the OP by taking the narrowest interpretation of their words, and making fun of such interpretation to discredit the OP.
A lot of words for something that should be obvious :P but such is life.

It's.. it's an example. Just mentally replace "bitcoin cash" with any hypothetical future fork able to survive a bitcoin debacle.

He gets it. If bitcoin fails, and bitcoin cash gains traction, we'll start calling bitcoin cash just "bitcoin". That's his point

Oh, you are going for *ad hominem* now? C'mon man, there's better fallacies to pick from :P

Sure, when I talk aloud. Do you not?
