i bet he does it to buy Litecoin!
or because he wants to get rid of some when stockmarkets kick in and liquidity rises..

I only do (educated) guesses of course...
- But with Huobi adding Litecoin next week it seems legit to get some LTC in case he wants to diversify or make profits.
- And with big stock markets getting on board of BTC in the near future it seems legit to dissolve now in order to be able to sell some when the big liquidity kicks in, in case he wants to turn a chunk of his BTC into fiat (which seems legit imo if you hold 111k).

what he basically says close to the end is, that he prefers more stable and more universally accepted currencies. 
additionally he compares bitcoin to already fully matured currencies instead of taking a more differentiated approach.
not so good i think.

not that I would take it personal, after all its the internet.. but still you lack substance in your posts

Not that you did in any way refute my arguments (although of course they can not predict the future)...
But hey, lets just flame without any substance whatsoever.
