You are misinterpreting. By not signing an agreement does not mean that one is against it. I don't know Trezor's stance but I think it's going to be neutral, just like with bcash.

You are paying to your ISP for your internet connection. Faster connection is more expensive. I'd like to think it's something similar with Bitcoin. It's a community run service and you pay for using it. Pay more for faster transactions.

Schnorr signatures seem to be a huge deal for those who are stuck with dust transactions.

I don't see it as a bad thing. I think arbitrage trading happens all the time, such as someone buys tons of stuff from china for cheap and sells it higher on somewhere else. It creates more demand where it's bought (price rises) and creates more supply to where it's being sold (price lowers). So it kinda levels out markets on a global scale.
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:07:57

I have to agree. Compared to contactless payments (RFID credit cards) this just feels so clunky and awkward if you need to wait tens of seconds for getting any kind of confirmation.

I guess I'd like to share this advice: be paranoid. There are malware out there that are after your wallets. Try to keep your devices airgapped. As soon as you manage to recover your funds, move your coins to somewhere safe, for example to cold storage or to a hardware wallet.

* Short term relief on the scaling issue
* Hard forking leads to client incompatibility issues when upgrade has no near full consensus
* Slippery slope to network centralization
* Too small timescale for a full network upgrade
* It's shady: project development and decision making are not fully transparent to the public

That's a sound theory. The bottom line seems to be that something is causing miners to selectively favor legacy tx's than segwit tx's to their blocks. If there are lots of segwit tx's on backlog, should we expect a spike upwards in this graph?

Not a chance. The private keys to your bitcoins are held in your own device, not by any company. Plus Trezor firmware and schematics are all open source, so if manufacturing of Trezor devices somehow stop someday, anyone could create their own Trezor clone device and restore private keys to it.
@_date: 2017-05-23 06:07:19
That seems to be in the US only. But nonetheless very impressive.

Consider the following scenario.
Step 1: Memorize Trezor seed.
Step 2: Leave Trezor at home, travel outside US.
Step 3: Purchase a secondary Trezor abroad.
Step 4: Restore memorized seed into secondary Trezor.
Step 5: Profit.
And when you need to travel back home, store your secondary Trezor somewhere where you can retrieve it later (friend's house for example).
