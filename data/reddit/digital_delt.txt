do you have any evidence to back up this claim or are you just making stuff up?

A mixed bag of arguments, some of them valid and some of them weak. 
Lightning network can in fact reduce fee congestion if more transactions are happening off chain.   The challenge is that if you want to transact with your bitcoin cheaply and have the most possible places accept it, you will probably park your currency with a big payment channel that's connected to as many other things as possible.  The system encourages centralization.  If you connect to a smaller, less-connected hub, you'll have to go through more hops (and pay more fees) to get your payment sent.
So yes, fees could get cheaper, but transactions got a whole lot more complex, and now there's two types of fees, miner fees paid for opening and closing the channel, and hub fees paid to relay the transaction through the network.

almost 4 years now and no resolution in sight!  The BTC/USD ratio might as well be 1mil before they resolve it.

But if everyone did this, then transactions paying less than $3.72 would never confirm

why not trade on their GDAX exchange?  Fees are 0% for limit orders, and they can increase your withdrawal limits if you ask them

People are downvoting your post without thinking twice, but you bring up a good point.  A difficulty adjustment based on nothing but blocktime alone (2016 blocks) is prone to a negative feedback loop.  If blocks aren't being found, the difficulty adjustment wont arrive for a protracted amount of time.
Bitcoin has never really encountered this problem before because it's hashpower has (usually) been steadily increasing throughout it's lifespan, and blocks haven't been so full at the same time to cause a major traffic jam.

Looks like they're not letting people actually withdraw the bitcoin?  So is it only good for buying and selling?

Take this, it's dangerous to go alone

Bitcoin is still experimental tech, it got very popular very quickly without a scaling solution in place yet. That doesn't mean one isn't coming.

You can call their phone support at +1 (888) 908–7930

1 week av. block time -

can you convert your money to something else and then send it into Gemini?  Doesn't Gemini have ETH?  There's also Coinbase
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:46:58
nope, the amounts are recognized on two different independent chains. So if you sent 14 BCH it would not remove any of the BTC
@_date: 2017-11-15 04:58:22
except you can't actually withdraw the bitcoin, so they're only chasing day traders

How did you send this transaction?  Where did it come from? Aka what program created the transaction?
The transaction paid $12.48 in fees 
@_date: 2017-11-18 20:12:29
Didn't the original organizers call it off entirely once it became clear they had insufficient support?
Then you get Jeff Garzik trying to do it all himself, I don't think he can speak for every NYA signer at that point.

were you sending bitcoin INTO your coinbase wallet, or sending money out of your Coinbase wallet to somewhere else?
