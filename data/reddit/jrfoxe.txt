I don't have any of those yet, but thanks for the ideas. I'll definitely get started working on social media and changetip seems pretty promising.

That and you wouldn't be able to actually use the money. It usually takes me a day or two to transfer from venmo to my bank acct

I'm actually not sure myself haha I guess signing up for a site that gives you a virtual wallet ? If that even makes sense

Interesting. How long do these things usually take? Like if I'm gonna get 2 BTC, is there any way I can have them in an account by tomorrow?
Also when signing up for my "wallet" do I want to hide my ip somehow and sign up for a new email (while also hiding myself)?

Thanks for the heads up, that's why I've been asking so many questions. I'm gonna do a lot more research before I make a more informed decision.

So using that local one, how do I get them without getting scammed (never bought coins before). It seems a little fishy since I see someone selling them like 30 bucks below market value
