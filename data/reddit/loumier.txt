Did someone ask how many boxes did he sell?
@_date: 2018-01-31 14:45:05
I think Xapo still avaible

I saw some people saying that's related with the Chinese Luner New Year's Evem that happens early February. As China has the biggest supply of Bitcoins, that could really be related.

But they didn't say they are, that's media speculation. They anounced in 2013 that they invested 11 million dollars in Bitcoin. Then the media adjusted the amount they bought to today's value.

Some people are saying also Lightning Network can't scale enough to support every single transaction in the world, it may needs one more layer.
@_date: 2018-01-31 17:15:45
Search for the gold graph and you can see the same pattern. If you still believe the "bitcoin bubble" just poped sell all your crypto. I'm buying.

I'd love to speak french so I could read the news. If it's true, I'm moving now to Quebec to open my own mining operation.
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:32:05
And why is it relevant?
@_date: 2017-12-16 02:05:00
I thought there was nothing related with this in english, but I found this article written by a famous anarchocapitalist activist:

Do you prefer a paper wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-16 03:26:48
Well, I'm a brazilian living in Brazil(unfortunately, I'd like to move to Canada) and last time I checked Brazil hasn't very appreciation for freedom. It's a common behavior from brazilians demanding more and more "free stuff" from the government at the cost of giving their freedom. Brazil isn't full on commie... until now.
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:30:10
Sorry, my mistake.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:47:01
What do you mean with "7 days to clear crypto"? I don'y use Coin Base. Is it a dealy for withdrawing crypto to your own wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:33:16
So having a a rooted or non rooted device changes nothing? The only thing matters is how I take care with my phone, reight? As I'll use the LG G2 only for storing my BTC, this should be safe.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:07:08
The thing about the Lightning Network is that we don't know how much it can scale the Bitcoin transactions. I saw some people saying LN can scale to millions of transactions per second, that's much more than any centralized payment method. But the developers didn't say anything about numbers. Anyway, I hope we can see LN runing on Bitcoin as soon as possible.
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:45:11
The companies and commerce are prohibited from accepting Bitcoin as a payment method, risking to get in jail for 6 months. The law isn't clear, but it may affect the exchanges too.
@_date: 2018-05-01 18:07:30
Of course I do. Many of these Ads are actually scams. Banning crypto related ads won't prevent the crypto market to scale.
@_date: 2019-11-05 15:56:31
I wouldn't say it's going to save a country but some people for sure.
@_date: 2017-08-29 20:08:01
That's true. Even if Bitcoin would fail as a currency (that probably is never going to happens), it's philosophy will still live.
@_date: 2018-03-13 13:58:52
You're right, I found it. Bisq supports our fiat currency. Anyway there's no any offer on Bisq's offer book on our currency.
@_date: 2018-02-27 23:05:24
The only reason they are doing this it's force people to use the government shit token
@_date: 2018-03-01 20:59:42
Really nice quotes. Thanks for sharing it with us.
@_date: 2018-02-12 13:18:16
My brother-in-law lives in Toronto and he bought some Bitcoins by Coinbase.
@_date: 2018-03-06 13:47:47
I was simulating an exchange from BTC to XMR, but the fee too high. 0,02XMR.
@_date: 2018-03-07 00:02:36
They certainly will care a lot when they get divorced from their ex-husbands that bought some BTC.
@_date: 2018-02-23 23:30:06
For iPhone I don't know, but for Android there is Minergate. Besides that, you will take literally hundreds of years to mine a single BTC. Also, mining cryptocurrencie requires high performance. As smartphones weren't developed to work on high performance on most part of the time, this could cause some physical damage to your phone.
@_date: 2018-02-23 00:08:39
The truth has been spoken.
@_date: 2018-02-27 20:39:25
I would be it will have 2000% pre-mine, just like their fiat inflation
@_date: 2018-02-02 18:52:00
So people were caught on a FUD. Oh, who could imagine?
@_date: 2018-02-19 21:06:50
Would be great to have a widget at desktop or the lock screen. Just an advice.
@_date: 2018-03-13 13:45:33
I'd like, but unfortunately it doesn't support our fiat currency.
@_date: 2018-03-06 13:46:25
Have you ever used Bisq?

Brazilian from São Paulo here. Actually STMBit companie wasn't an exchange, it actually was a ponzi scam. Many people already knew it was scam and we alerted these people, but they ignored us.
@_date: 2018-02-27 13:52:36
That's just because Maduro wants to force people to accept Petro. It's ironic the technology that was created to achieve a more free society it's been large adopted by a dictatorship. lol
@_date: 2018-02-23 14:38:28
I didn't know Le Iene still exists.
@_date: 2018-02-23 00:38:06
It's because STMBit is actually just a little ponzi scam. They aren't even well know as Mercado Bitcoin or Foxbit.
@_date: 2018-02-23 14:06:21
I hope you were being sarcastic.
@_date: 2018-02-19 15:14:58
Finding your real name on internet isn't that hard. You'd be surprised how easy is to find lots of information about random people. Just allow 2FA on your wallet account and ignore it.

I'm a brazilian that lived in Italy some years ago and I found this one of the best news about Bitcoin I've ever seen. And there is a huge difference how the brazilian media and the italian media are treating Bitcoin. Here in Brazil the media is just misinforming people with some FUD.
@_date: 2018-02-23 00:09:47
I'm worried about it, because many people in my country are truly believing this shitcoin has any value.
@_date: 2018-02-23 14:07:01
Venezuela's government thinks everyone is retarded, except themselves. This shitcoin is obviously a scam and no one will accept it as payment.
@_date: 2018-02-04 00:50:03
The problem is that many Bitcoin owners are just common people that really doesn't care about Bitcoin's philosophy.
@_date: 2018-02-23 14:35:43
That's not too much. It's just two pizzas price.

@_date: 2018-02-08 15:29:56
Same to me. Since I began to study about cryptocurrencie i became more interested on investments.
@_date: 2018-02-23 00:38:59
Exactly, you're right. The biggest brazilian exchanges has by 1 million clients. This companie is just a shit ponzi scam.
@_date: 2018-02-27 16:49:23


Blockchain is distributed ledger that records all the transactions. When a transaction is validated and written on the Blockchain, you can ensure the transaction occured successfully.


It's basically a layer network to make transactions outside of Blockchain. Blockchain is very slow to deal with a high volume of transactions per second, so Lightning Network it's a solution to make it faster.

Is that kind of person would vote an obviously corrupt politician just beacause he's popular with common people don't if he's destroying the economy? Well, the same happens in Brazil.
@_date: 2018-02-27 14:43:47
Yes, Venezuela's situation is getting worse everyday. Also my country (Brazil) is having some issues because the mass immigration to some northern brazilian cities.
I saw some Venezuelans complaining about the the government is prosecuting cryptocurrencie miners.

I knew Zimbabwe was suffering a huge problem with inflation some years ago, but does Zimbabwe still suffer this problem?

I already gave up of Brazil. Once I finish my graduation I'll move to Canada.
@_date: 2018-02-23 00:09:21
Still better than a centralized government shitcoin.
