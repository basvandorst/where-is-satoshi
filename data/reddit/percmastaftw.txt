You can factory reset the device, right? There's nothing forcing you to use the given seed?

It's not even 11pm EST and the market is open all day! But, no, I don't think it's too late.

Hey man, if anything, you need to look into RaiBlocks. This thing has near early bitcoin growth potential. Check it out ASAP.

What's predicted after 2030? Stays at $500,000 or continues to climb?

One of the financial/investment advisers I've talked to that are allowed to give specific investment advice said for me not to put anymore money into crypto as it's already too much of my overall portfolio (after it grew), and from his experience, things that go up this high always come back down, though he's not saying it's going down in the next day/week/month. 
Some of his other advise (since I wanted to stay in the crypto field) was to take some of it out as a profit and possibly move around my big winners to the other coins that haven't done so well yet or are lower prices. He basically just said to protect myself by not making my portfolio too crypto-based.
Edit: Like TheSecretMe said, my advisor said the same thing. Even if you "diversify" your crypto, its still crypto. Its the same as investing in two or three oil companies. If oil tanks, your investments in both, or your entire crypto investment will go down. Best not to think of different cryptos as really any different from each other if theres a crypto crash overall.

Excuse my ignorance, so does this mean that you can only "mine" the 2x coin, and we won't be receiving a similar amount comparable to our current BTC's?
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:07:50
Yep, I'm done with that. Let the pros have it...
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:35:37
Thanks for the statistics, myth1n. 
So, this btc2x is supposed to be the "new" bitcoin, correct? I've been checking both of the sub-reddits, but I'm wondering how much of a chance this new coin might replace our current bitcoin? If we sell our new btc2x and it becomes to standard, are we pretty much SOL?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:58:16
As well as GDAX.
EDIT: Off and on.
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:39:10
Yeah, I've still made money. Just trying to make light of my bad decisions haha.

So wait, I thought Coinbase was one to give a harder time to give forked coins? Are wallets going to have the same exact high level of qualifications as Coinbase as to when they are going to give their user's their share? I feel like CB might be ripping us off again.
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:01:17
And do you know that for sure? From everything I'm reading, people have been writing that nobody knows what will happen. Some saying that they can't really exist together etc and that one will win out. On the general cryptocurrency subreddits, a lot are jist completely taking their bitcoins out and putting it in alternates until the "chaos" settles. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:35:19
Yes, I replied that to another comment as well. It seems they'd have higher qualifications as to when they'd give us our coins versus a wallet, as they still haven't even given any bitcoin gold that could have been received through a wallet.

The new email updated their two scenarios and there's a strong chance we won't be able to take it out (at least for awhile)
"Scenario 1: Network is unusable
If support for the fork remains at current levels or decreases, the Bitcoin2x network will be unusable. Coinbase will not support withdrawals or trading as it will not be possible to move these assets. Currently we believe this is the most likely scenario.
If the network gains support at a later date, we will enable Bitcoin2x withdrawals from the platform. 
Scenario 2: Network is usable
If transactions are being confirmed at a reasonable speed and miner support is strong, we will allow Coinbase customers to withdraw Bitcoin2x. We will not immediately enable buys and sells as previously stated, but we may enable them at a later date."
Do you have any quick wallets you can recommend me?
@_date: 2017-09-04 19:11:10
Definitely don't buy on coinbase. Use their gdax website. Spent $500 on coinbase (card) and was charged $20. Bought 3.5k on gdax: $10.
Edit: I probably bought at market price. I think if you instead fill out an order on gdax, it's free.

I mean, I think OP has a million dollars+ in USD, and now is putting more money into bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-06 10:25:38
It was a pun. "Dubai." "Do buy more bitcoin."
@_date: 2017-09-14 22:37:40
Yeah, I'm doing this for the long term. Maybe I shouldn't worry at all, but it would always be nice to get alittle more BTC during these drops. I do realize it's risky.
Could you please elaborate on your last point if you can?
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:15:25
Transfer it to GDAX (Coinbase's exchange) for free and use limit sells/buys for no fees.
@_date: 2017-09-14 22:23:03
Would you recommend a sell right now to gain more Bitcoin after the expected drop? Or would you guess that bitcoin will "recover" a bit the next couple weeks, drop just a bit after the 30th (higher than selling now), therefore recommend still holding?
I'm just randomly guessing that once the 30th hits and they actually ban their exchanges, it'll hit a bunch of people that it's really happening, causing that drop, but I'm not experienced enough to figure out if it'll be less than now or not. I'd assume it would be, but if you have any input, would be appreciated.

dubai more bitcoin, please...

How exactly do you get the new coin after the fork if you set up a wallet?
@_date: 2017-10-24 21:34:12
Hmm, I just got the email, and it said a Bitcoin Gold split occurred yesterday, October 23rd?? Are we not getting that, or was that a mistake?
@_date: 2017-09-06 02:43:24
What does that mean realistically? What can they do being the "true owners"?
