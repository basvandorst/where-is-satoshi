Isn't it hilarious how reddit loves to vilify millionaires/billionaires for not paying their fair share of taxes? Even going so far as to say capital gains taxes are too low? Then, when a whole bunch of redditors make a ton of money in bitcoin, almost everyone is shocked that Uncle Sam wants a cut? The lack of self awareness is amazing.

It's adorable how you think we could have anything resembling the society we have today without taxation.

It costs between 2 and 5 million dollars to build one mile of road. Multiply that by the 8 million miles of road in the US and it's a staggering amount of money.
Also, let's not forget all the other things taxes pay for. Like your education, which you are using right now to post to Reddit.
You're either a troll, or completely clueless. 
I don't know where or how you are equating taxation with "use of force" or child murder. If you have issues with international policy or the priorities of our spending, that's one thing. But you seem to think taxes=murder and I just don't see it.

That's a percentage of your gains, not of the total sale price. So if you spent 1000 on btc and cashed out for 10000, you get taxed on 9000.

Yes 10% day over day gains for 2 weeks straight is totally normal growth and not at all  the same exact pump and dump that happened in 2017.

Lol, are you serious? You think a billionaire wants to leave $300 million in Bitcoin today just to have it drop 50% 2 weeks from now?

Unending continuous exponential growth is totally normal. A year over year gain of 1000%, also normal.

That black market propping you guys up. That or it's a pump and dump.
Oh wait, I totally forgot that a $100,000 Bitcoin is totally inevitable and a 10 trillion dollar market cap is totally normal and not at all comparable to the combined worth of all oil reserves of all nation's combined.
