French is a rich language, not like English, sometime we have 4 words for the same thing.
We can then say **cryptomonnaie**, **cryptoactif**, **cryptodevise**, **monnaie cryptographique** or **cybermonnaie.**
But you're right about "cyber", it's an old prefix, nobody use it nowadays.

Yes, here in France we can buy tobacco only in this kind of shop. We can also buy ticket lottery and newspaper.

I live in France, in this case this is a shop that sells tobacco, lottery and newspaper. We can only buy tobacco in this kind of shop.
So it's very crowded veryday, it's like a cheap 7eleven.

Not at all, we are very free to buy bitcoin from everywhere we want. We just have to give our ID online.
We can already buy it irl at some places like La Maison du Bitcoin.
French governement doesn't give a shit about bitcoin atm, they have a "Gilets Jaunes" situation :D

Way too expensive, you can buy it online with your credit card, it will be the same price and you don't need to find a "tabac" selling it...

They've closed my account few years ago, they sent me back my last deposit minus fees.They never really told me why ? I just miss a bull run because of them, i would never recommand bitstamp to anyone.
