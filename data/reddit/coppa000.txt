Ok fair enough. It's just that some people I talk to seem like they are on the cusp of understanding why Bitcoin is important - and then thry go and read some article in the WSJ about how Bitcoin is worth "zero".

Ok fair enough. I invest quite heavily in automation. Across various sectors. Housing isn't going to crash but it make take a steady decline or not raise along side inflation. Therefore becoming cheaper. All the money that is spent on maintaining and building houses is going into automation. Your handyman can do 10 times the jobs at the same cost. Better housing at the same cost. Better rental properties at the same cost.

I made a 600% return on betting Trump would win in 2016. I still haven't finished spending/investing the money I returned on that. My timeframe is I see massive growth, antagonistic international relations but ultimately countries growing together. Into the fourth industrial revolution.

Maybe in the supply chain. The biggest cost with property is land, second to that maintenance. 
Maintenance is both land and building. So securing the air, soil, water quality around the property and land with semi automated or automated systems is necessary.
I guess what I'm saying is a boom in maintenance would offset declining land value.

Listen here buddy, no one out there and here gives a shit about you. We alone in this. This is the real shit. The moment. The storm before the calm. The pain before the release. The filtering of the souls. You maybe fucked you maybe saved. Coward or not will not change anything.
No way. No way we think together until after. Only after

Coinbase are allowing bcash trading on their platform because they get fees from the transactions (about 1%). Coinbase obviously feel they need the money. This doesn't make Coinbase a bad company.

No way. No way we are together until after. Only after. Like veterans. Only after.
It's hunker down time not talkie time. Call yourself brave means nothing. Call others coward means nothing. 
Be silent let time pass. Taking you forward. Soak the ether, produce your own vibes. Then we talk. If talkie time turns you on, makes you fired up, you dead already, coward or not.

Apparently a lot of people who placed their bets after the first Republican debate in Aug 2015 got returns of up to 2000%. I didnt bet until after he won New Hampshire but the odds went up and down after that from 1000% to 300% 
Well I don't gamble, I bet less than 5% of my savings, the money was just in a sort of high risk "savings and investment" account. 
What im talking about is the qualitative analysis, people just didn't get that this guy *could* win, so the odds were skewed, the odds were always against him and I'm surprised he won, but the market odds should have been lower. I see the same with Bitcoin.
It's the "never" attitude that some people have that really confuses me - it's so emotional.
