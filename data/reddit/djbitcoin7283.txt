This looks good......I'm bout to try it
@_date: 2013-04-08 12:34:06
this may be more intuitive for newcomers. I like it we just got to refine it
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:15:54
invite please
@_date: 2013-03-27 00:15:42
hey can you describe how this would work step for step with a wallet address?
Honestly haven't looked to much into it but i do well when i play it for free 
@_date: 2013-03-28 14:20:02
It's acting as one inadvertently. Or maybe a bond. I imagine there's a large number of people that have some set away for long term appreciation and other bitcoins to use as a MoE.

im guessing a ddos attack. when i went to btc-e it displayed a message about DDOS and cloudflare or whatnot.

Just woke up on the east coast. I will definitley be putting another thousand in.

"donation are always welcome" is that begging? or u just trolling cause you're bored??? And none gives a f**k what your habits are. And Pathetic is wasting your time posting something is pathetic._Dumbassnameaurusrexs' time must not be worth much...
might as well be grammer checking everyone

Does anyone know where I can buy a bitcoin atm?????? I would love to open a business like this. Totally could do it
@_date: 2013-03-28 13:57:43
Ive got a post for $40 on local bitcoins. no biters so far
@_date: 2013-04-04 19:47:47
I just did one a hr ago. worked

like bitcoinheaven said "we need to have a ranking system to establish credibility" its a must in the near future and whoever does it will be "RICH BITCH"

with increased savings will come banks that offer more loans. more investment, more capital, more output, more consumption, more utility.
Also if the gov't doesn't use exp mp countries will endure some classical medicine which may be the fairest option

be ready for the weekend dive
@_date: 2013-04-04 23:22:55
OOOOOOMMMMMMMMGGG this is crazy
is this true?
@_date: 2013-03-26 23:25:57
Do it,
It would cost them nothing to start besides time: register on local bitcoins and put up a sign. Tey could even help someone setup an account in minutes.
But then again so can you.......
I'm betting some people are makiing money buy doin that
@_date: 2013-04-03 12:36:32
two weeks ago. fees are ridiculous with moneygram
@_date: 2013-04-13 13:56:23
this is really good episode. keep it up. I like the knowledge of the experts (adds credibility) but one criticism - ALL seven days not just M-F but i know i know. Great way to learn some things and the comments don;t accurately reflect the arguments. They are sound
@_date: 2013-04-04 16:26:21
Can anyone verify anything about coinlab opening on monday?
@_date: 2013-04-04 14:16:28
this would undermine the point of the fed: to adjust monetary policy (moneysupply) to expand or contract the economy to it's long run equilibrium. So i don't see how we could have both because everyone would go the crypto. But maybe that speaks more to my vision then your statement................
@_date: 2013-04-04 23:35:55
do you think that 4 trillion dollar a day estimate is right? Anyone think that's biggest number right now that btc can get to?
@_date: 2013-04-04 23:33:23
maybe try to hook them up with bitpay.
there was guy that posted something about a card developing a card reader a few weeks back but i don't think he finished it yet.
@_date: 2013-04-04 19:21:13
right right, i was in a bad moood. all good
@_date: 2013-04-13 13:31:25
we need a daily news cast this is alright for now
@_date: 2013-04-04 14:18:44
lol. as an econ major I too found this hilarious
@_date: 2013-04-04 16:25:20
also quick thought---- is it anonymous if it says name of account- verified -name of account???????? no so if i open myself to truly anonymous donations its my perogative.. Don't waste the comment space turning the post into a different subject. LOL did the five people after get anything from the post other than the last line
