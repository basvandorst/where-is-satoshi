I'd get one. Kick start it if you need to build in bulk to lower over all costs.  You also are able to test the market without a major initial investment.

I've never seen this under windows or linux (with the vanilla client or otherwise).  I've suspect something very specific to your implementation.
Review your network speed (in and out) and your harddrive iops for high utilization.  Good luck!
@_date: 2012-10-01 19:05:38
Oh Bender, you totally would say that. ;)
@_date: 2012-10-12 22:33:42
You would probably use it like the current FPGA designs.
Simple Version:
You plug it into a computer (USB)
You run a mining application that supports the hardware (free and readily available - notes of each will describe what is supported)
I own a BFL single and have a pre-order for ASIC hardware.

Nope sure isn't..

Happy to see more announcements in this arena.  Happy mining everyone! :)

When you pay taxes (as a US citizen) you have to pay taxes in USD.  To determine how much tax is owed for Bitcoin related transactions you need to convert to USD and report off that.  (And yes you DO have to report it)

I've also been seeing RPC errors communicating with the pool off and on today.

If you're traveling to Vegas you can also check out all the ways to spend bitcoin on the way there too! :)  In either case enjoy!

Yep, that's been my experience with the FPGA's on the market now.  I use cgminer and the BFL single is just auto-detected. Worked perfectly with little technical knowledge.  I was quite surprised. :)

I suspect the issue is that some malware has included the minning application in themselves for bot-net minning.  The real mining application is taking the blame due to the signatures involed with the malware in the wild.
Might not be acurate in this (or every case) but worth pointing out.
@_date: 2012-09-17 23:45:15
I agree completely and believe this is most likely the case.  (I'm also one of those who have pre-ordered some of this equipment from BFL).
@_date: 2012-10-13 02:07:31
I kindly think of it as a power brick.  The power supply is large, but nothing else real special about it.

I fund mine [thebitmines.com]( with player subscriptions and real bitcoin mining.  Good Luck!
@_date: 2012-09-27 02:33:29
Awesome find :)
@_date: 2012-10-13 14:13:52
Good Luck!  Very excited to see you succeed!
@_date: 2012-11-30 21:02:19
Lots of people are interested in this.  I got close with [The Bit Mines](  Let me know if you need development assistance.  I'm just finishing up the core to this system and will be releasing it soon.
Good Luck!

This was my experience going from bank account to Mt. Gox.  (I'm in the US)
Link bank account to Dwolla (few days)
Transfer money into Dwolla from bank account (few days)
Dwolla AML processing (few days + 30 days after your first transaction with them) Ugh!
Mt. Gox AML processing (few days)
Dwolla -&gt; Mt. Gox USD transfer, took a few hours.  0.25 USD cost
Once you have a balance at Mt. Gox you will need to submit an order for bitcoin.  Near instant.
Once the order completes you get bitcoin which you can then transfer out.  Near instant, and normal bitcoin transaction fees apply. 
So expect to wait 4+ weeks if you are just now getting started.  If you want a quicker turn around you should check out  I hear they are highly rated. I've never used them though.  Alternatively there are independent brokers who sell too.

This was an article specifically about Bitcoin gambling and not Bitcoin gaming.  I had to check as I run an online Bitcoin gaming business that is NOT gambling.  This is apparently even more niche and not worth mention to anyone.. sigh...  In time.. ;)

It depends significantly on the hardware of the machines in question.  Don’t both using CPU mining, and only look into GPU mining if they all have decent graphics cards (with supported hardware and drivers) listed for the mining applications. 
Check out these links for information on mining and on specific performance metrics for hardware/software combinations:

I believe there are a few actually.  Generally they are shopping carts (with plugin frameworks of their own) and then the functionality can be added or it’s natively available.
A quick search reveals:
1)	** I believe this is the one I played with last year **
WP e-Commerce
plus the bitpay connector:
2) There's also (don’t know any specifics about this one):
 
 
 
Check out  for more information and a number of ways to approach this.  Bitpay will be the easiest way to handle the Bitcoin payments its just a matter of finding plugins that meet your needs.
I also don’t know the current status of the project  (  but it looks promising.

I concur - hoping to see competition reduce this service fee.
I see some current vendors trying to operate this way - "speculating" on the price of Bitcoin to offset these types of fees.  They and their customers get burned in public ways.  In the end it would just be gambling with your company's assets.
@_date: 2013-07-22 23:14:52
I've been following your work since last October :)  I'll be introducing a few of people to it on Saturday during our nodejs get-together.  Hopefully I can spark some Bitcoin discussions and get some other developers interest aroused in my local area.
Thanks for your work on this project!

I find this change distasteful and it’s a step on a slippery slope to transaction blacklisting.  It's concerning as I run a business which may be impacted by this if not now, then definitely in the future.
@_date: 2013-07-21 15:59:33
As far as I know every solution will use bitpay ultimately. 
Multibit Merchant ( is a fully self-contained platform but I've never used it myself.

If you can afford to pre-order ASIC hardware and want to be *in* bitcoin for a while then do so.   Having a steady stream of bitcoin coming in to trade, sell, or save is awesome!  I do currently with my FPGA miner and have not regretted the purchase of the equipment (which has paid for itself and the ASIC pre-orders).  
On that note don't "hold off" on ordering hardware - you want to order your equipment ASAP as the amount of coin you generate over the lifetime of the equipment will be less the longer you wait.
@_date: 2013-07-19 17:07:25
I've done this with Amazon and at a physical Cabela's store.  Awesome stuff that gyft app. :).
@_date: 2013-07-19 17:09:27
This can also be done with a self-hosted Wordpress instance that uses a digital goods and bitcoin enabled checkout (no coding needed).  Good luck!
