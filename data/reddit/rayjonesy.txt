 Yes, I would always recommend recording down the 12-18-24 character phrase and ensuring you can recover the wallet in case the hardware wallet fails. Having a back-up of anything should be the case, and I would recommend having multiple phrase back-ups in a safe, secured and encrypted on offline storage etc.
 I would say the hard part is making sure to get a clean and secure paper wallet. The source of getting to the paper wallet is the biggest issue. You need to make sure it's a legit site and create the paper wallet offline, and then have some way of printing off the paper wallet which is 100% secure.  A hardware based wallet like the Ledger HW.1 is $19 give or take, so that's nothing  in price especially when it comes to security. The hardware wallets listed increase in price up to $99. To each their own, and if you want to be really secure, you can do multisig, but it's not easy to use and you would need to move all bitcoins each time as there would be no return address. I'd only multisig use that for long-term cold storage, and when the coins are moved, you would move them all at once to another wallet or multisig wallet.
I personally would go for a hardware wallet do to the ease of use, but if you are paranoid you can go with a paper wallet, but you need to make sure it's legit code that you can use offline and then you need to get that data printed or transcribe it again to paper, all of which can introduce ways for your private keys to be compromised.

Go with a hardware wallet, Trezor, KeepKey, Ledger HW.1, Nano, or Nano S. Do not use a mobile based wallet, keep them offline so no chance of being hacked.
