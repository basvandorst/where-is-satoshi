well thanks for the input.. 
so, all the info i took in.. basically trading the price would be silly. 
And if, I ever do throw money into it. I should mathematically, try and wait for a time the price per GHS is cheap enough to recoop total earnings in a couple of months, and possibly just reinvest most of the bitcoins each month? or something similiar to keep up with the hashes??
---- tho all of this got me thinking, and if, it requires more hashes each block or something.. if hardware can't keep up with the need.. and the btc price is stable at a decent price still... wouldn't theoretically this raise the GHS/ price??? 
or possibly, there are already too many GHS right now. and, technology is up too speed, and keeps the price deflating? 
and now with all of the talking.. idk, if its the masses, but people are questioning cex.io trustworthiness.. 
@_date: 2014-02-17 00:13:56
is that the nature of the exchange? it could make sense, with all of the factors involved.. so, it's usually on a deflation cycle?

though, in technical analysis if you can even use it in bitcoins.. looks like a very standard double top.

not looking into trading, yet. though, i will have to convert purchases from btc into cash asap, right? i dont want any market volatility, if i did it this way.
