They are talking about scam coins and do have some skeptics on it though, but no real negatives about the real coins yet!

Watching it at the minute, seems to be quite positive!

Quite an interesting example, facts will always beat opinions in a sense, so it can be seen as biased, or favourable towards a side.

They really haven’t tried to shill BTC for weeks, if you would have watched the most recent  [BBC Panorama]( on BTC, you would know that they have a balanced view on it.

Can you name me any other tv news outlets that are famed for being unbiased?

The director general doesn’t even earn as much as the top five performers. Anyway, why do you think this, why do you not like the BBC? It’s always been influential in british culture.

I agree, they aren’t as neutral as they were 15 years ago, but I see more hate for the beeb than I do for fox and cnn, which there should be more hatred to due to they are opposite sides of the spectrum. 
  Still I trust them over channel four, and their 24/7 coverage is great, but snopes should be used just to double check.

if you need one of those apps and are on iOS use Crypto Pro, it’s really good. Not sure about android though, just look for portfolio trackers.
