Not true but funny
@_date: 2019-07-26 13:50:27
This! ��
@_date: 2019-07-02 12:43:32
You’re predictable, too.
@_date: 2019-07-26 13:47:23
Cute, but you don’t get it, do you.
@_date: 2019-07-12 00:12:55
That will drive up the price.
@_date: 2019-07-02 01:31:46
Hey, Forbes, it’s ‘Bitcoin’ not ‘bitcoin’ ffs.

Those guys were performing 9,000 jobs (on the books) each, so...
@_date: 2019-07-11 23:50:56
Wrong. People would be competing with others as to who would get the trade first. Price goes up.
@_date: 2019-07-01 02:14:35
It’s peanut butter jelly time.
@_date: 2019-07-26 13:49:51
Except for the one before ‘with’, my friend.

Love the shirt. Glad it’s a v-neck. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:07:42
Love it.

It’s not profit until you sell the BTC. 
@_date: 2019-06-29 00:36:12
Shit, he goin ta zero
@_date: 2019-06-06 02:33:28
You forgot “buy Bitcoin Cash” thinking it’s Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-21 03:30:44
I know c+pearl.
@_date: 2019-06-02 17:13:40
You change the scale to make it appear to rise at 45°
@_date: 2019-06-21 03:34:40
That 45° degree butcher knife is how.
@_date: 2019-06-12 19:40:34
The name is stupid.
@_date: 2019-05-16 21:17:47
Especially once the masses start hearing about how Bitcoin inflation is less than nearly every fiat. in. the. world.
@_date: 2019-05-03 18:02:40
@_date: 2019-05-16 03:23:38
They refer to Bitcoin as a “token.” This suggests they don’t fully grasp the concept.
@_date: 2019-05-16 02:48:22
Buy volume exceeding sell volume.
@_date: 2019-05-03 18:05:58
Who the fuck is the NYSE chairman to know what constitutes as “better”?
@_date: 2019-05-04 01:06:33
And what
@_date: 2019-05-30 00:41:32
@_date: 2019-05-16 21:28:13
Look at it this way... There might be 2x the supply, but the demand will be x^2 and the rate of growth in that supply will be 1/2x. Fuzzy math, but I think it conveys the reality in relative terms well enough.
@_date: 2019-05-16 22:11:17
Cold and dead.
@_date: 2019-05-16 05:04:35
Aaaaand it’s gone
@_date: 2019-05-16 21:46:29
It already is a threat.
@_date: 2019-05-16 22:00:51
It’s always smart. The real question is can you wait long enough for that to be so. ��
