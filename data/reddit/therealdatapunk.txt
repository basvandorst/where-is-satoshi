But how is that going to solve scaling? There at least needs to be some reasonable way of state pruning, and even if that were the case, visa-level block sizes are only manageable for an absolute select few. Fuck decentralization, I guess...

I have 0 bitcoins, and his disparaging bullshit still pisses me off. "We have on-chain scaling, bitcoin core (sic) doesn't". 
Well, BCH doesn't either. It's just less used, and has a low multiple of the same maximum transaction rate. Not even close enough to be usable for everything-on-chain either. Pure shill, imo

The wonder of exchanges is that they are impossible to audit (or let's say, they aren't audited). Doesn't really matter if they truly hold the money or the BTC if they have high-confidence strategies for increasing them, they can just change a few numbers in their databases.

well, the only way to pay is in bitcoin, though, so in a cataclysmic event, miners might swap chains very quickly, causing a true death spiral.
Possible for pretty much any coin unless there is some form of emergency difficulty adjustment (which can be a problem of its own)

So Dyson spheres are developed for bitcoin mining?

Assuming he is in a country where it is a taxable event.

I did the same. Bought some stuff for what nowadays is $100,000... :(

I assume not your girl anymore? :)

I.e., perfect strategy in the bull market, bad strategy in a bear market (until it turns bullish again)

It really depends on the country in which you work. Some companies in the US have actively discouraged developers from using this awesome resource because they were able to limit exposure to lawsuits that way.

Stack Overflow has the major issue of code attribution and copyright. Most code is not automatically public domain, so copying examples can get your company into major trouble

The problem in a market as volatile as crypto is that there is no way of determining your proper allocation. Also, money becomes available with every paycheck for many people. If they determined that they want to put 10% into high-risk investments, then DCA is what they will to effectively anyway.
I've decided to do lump sum investing on stocks. Guess what, I haven't bought any in the last 3 years waiting for a crash, and missed relatively substantial gains.

What's this instant you're talking about? Need some fixes before that.

Exactly what I wanted to comment

I think this is mostly to the massively increased numbers of TX causing a high hardware load, meaning you can't just run it once in a while on your normal laptop without it causing issues.
Also, light wallets became more usable, so no more need.,.

You think I lose all technical credibility, but somehow think cryptokitties relates to mining cost. Go back to your play dough
@_date: 2018-03-21 15:16:20




ETH actually had higher POW cost at times over the last few months, so its contested.


I might give you that, but LTC has been gaining some ground here while BTC has been removed as a payment option when it had its fee woes


get out of your bubble. Just look at the developments in ETH, LTC, and even BCH (I am an ETH maximalist, but don't just discount other tech). 


Not sure by what metric this can be measured.


Sorry I am about 1-2 years too late.

Ethereum is quickly catching up on the support front, though.

Doesn't mean they arrested all of them already. They might have gone after the high-profile target when it came to a country with an extradition treaty (i.e., Vinnik going on vacation in Greece).

But between that and Cloudflare, it was hosted in Russia. It's somewhat reasonable to believe that they moved the servers out of the US in 2013, and did not return.
Nevertheless, there are enough countries collaborating with the US, so it's not unreasonable that the servers could have been picked up elsewhere.
@_date: 2017-07-30 18:05:32
The problem is that now the control over their domain has been seized as well. I do hope there will be some way of getting at my ETH that I had just traded earlier in anticipation of the split... A lot of my money was in there (yeah, stupid, but I had bad timing). 
Fucked twice by MtGox... It's incredible.
@_date: 2017-07-31 10:34:47
It would be good for me, because I did not launder money or evade taxes :)
@_date: 2017-07-31 10:40:49
Where did you see that? I only see cloudflare (and 1&amp;1 after the seize). I don't see the ip address you posted at all.

You might want to look into the fairly recent trend in the US of suing property instead of people: 
@_date: 2017-07-31 10:53:01
I don't think those people knew more than we do. From the DNS history, the last server before they went on Cloudflare was 
    178.248.232.6	Russia	Maksim Beloenko	2013-03-23
CrimeFlare.org doesn't work for me right now, so maybe I am missing a bit here.
@_date: 2017-07-31 13:51:55
Well, depends on what Ethereum is worth at that point in the future. Was a stupid hedge...
@_date: 2018-12-11 14:36:39
Wait, you hold BTC on exchanges?
@_date: 2018-12-12 14:27:05
Yes, I think white-collar crime should be punished as harsh as others, especially if it affected a much larger number of people.

Thanks. Didn't know about Qrator.
