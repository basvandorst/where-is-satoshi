Don't both browsers strip any executable bits to begin with? I've always had to manually chmod when downloading anything.

Distant future where the value of bitcoins has risen dramatically and drug dealers roam the streets (okay modern day):

They'd me kicked off Github and Bitbucket, most likely. Hm, that does pose an interesting question: What if there was a Github-like site similar to PirateBay in legality?

Uh, what's btcav? Search results for every search engine I tried are meaningless.

Oh wow, I used to play DarkOrbit. And by "used to" I mean such a long time ago that I have no idea if it was actually good.
Jeez, this is so tempting, I hate it. Now I know what people with credit cards feel like.

Just to note: This graph is biased. The first one is from April to October and the second is from February to August.

Could you make an "About" page? Would like to know details on how you are getting the keys from who and just more information in general would be nice. As it stands I can see a site that does something that seems too good to be true that asks me for my email. More information everywhere all over.

How is that not good? It just means the major novelty spike from (what I assume is) bitcointip going reddit-wide has worn off.

Oh my god, it worked. Thank you!

Sadly I'm in the UK so it's basically impossible for me to get bitcoins, but I'm hoping this leads to even greater acceptance and then more exchanges.

"Millibit" rolls off the tongue well. Millibit. Millibit. I like saying Millibit.

It's basically an encryped database, so I imagine it would be easier to audit than something as hefty as TrueCrypt.

"Titty". That's where that one falls down.

Because I wouldn't pay for it in paper format, the last time I got any kind of physical newspaper (years ago) I just got them for free.

Don't have the whole thing on one page. With HTML5 you can update the URL without refreshing the page, and having the URL always link to what the user can currently see is always good design practice. More pages like a list of every game with ordering options like A-Z, popularity and so on. A footer makes the site more professional and with one place to look for finding links to everything useful it helps a lot.
Simplicity is good, but make sure to NEVER confuse that with lack of features.

That.. Doesn't affect plugins. Plugins still run in whatever environment they want.

In my opinion this is the greatest single state a human can be in. You know you're not horrible, but know you could be better.

At some point in the future the value of bitcoins will be either different, or the same.
@_date: 2013-10-16 21:37:53
Thank you for neatly saying the exact opposite of the truth in every point you make.

Yes, there are plenty of people who read through the source code just for fun. Obfuscated code would never make it into the kernal.
The Linux kernal is perfectly secure, but there are few distros with no proprietary code at all, which could pose a backdoor.
Some things are inherently more secure than Windows, like having a package manager instead of downloading fully executable files just to install things. Linux is more newbie-proof than Windows.
Seriously the only thing Windows has going for it is that people still use it for whatever reason.

Wow, this is actually the [second most glided thread of all time]( I wonder how much publicity this has for bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-10-22 00:21:28
Short answer: No.
Long answer: Still no, jesus christ that could literally never happen unless your RNG was cryptographically insecure (and then you're fucked anyway)
