Yep, this right here is why bitcoin will never be successful as a currency ��

TX volume a) can be faked and b) doesn’t constitute *spending.* Crypto companies like Coinbase will obviously be biased in their conclusions from their R&amp;D. Have you considered that the people buying crap with their Bitcoins are only spending a small percentage of their total holdings? In other words, the people buying cars and homes with bitcoin are likely 1%ers with an f-ton of bitcoin. Also, I can see people cashing out like when we’re in a bubble such as 2017. But in a proper deflationary setting where the price doesn’t rise so parabolically, there will be a reduction in spending and consumerism.

5.5k was looking too expensive for a 7 tps shitcoin.

There are fundamental differences between saving and hoarding, friend. People who hold bitcoin are doing the latter because they expect the price to continue to appreciate over time. People who understand the basics of economics and finance, and have dollars held in a savings account are likely saving them there [temporarily].

This is a silly title. Most altcoins will not beat bitcoin because they are shitcoins. That said, the price ceiling is much higher than bitcoin for some of the alts which will actually be used for capabilities like smart contracts, supply chain tracking, etc.

“Best way to use your bitcoin”
I laughed.
Nobody is going to use their bitcoin — it’s a deflationary currency. People are going to hold onto their bitcoin in hopes of price appreciation. That is all.

When you choke someone until they pass out and go limp, there’s always a chance that they won’t be able to resume breathing and will die of asphyxiation. There’re other ways to control people’s physical selves without potentially killing them, like restrainment or compliance techniques. The guy who came up from behind had every opportunity to apply any number of those but instead chose to put the drunk dude to sleep. Dangerous shit.

I don’t think you understand what the element of surprise means.

What a joke.

The dipshit who choked him is probably sitting in a nice, cozy prison cell right about now.

Did you not just read my first paragraph?
