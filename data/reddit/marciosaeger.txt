I dont know what is worse: your bank or coinbase
@_date: 2018-01-28 17:21:01
This is the real thing to be considered. 
So, all future forks (free money) wont have your coins there if they dont support segwit. So, keep it on legacy address. Why bother saving 10 dollars ?!

@_date: 2018-01-29 08:47:53
You’re right. Really difficult
@_date: 2018-01-28 17:34:00
Hmmm, you have a point.. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 17:30:05
Nop. They could choose not to by just removing the support from the code. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:00:09
Is there any bad side about this ?

Keep the great work. I use all of them ��
@_date: 2017-12-29 18:19:53
Cool... cold as fuck
@_date: 2017-08-27 21:31:37
I wasnt disrespectful. It was a question.

@_date: 2017-08-27 14:44:39
Thanks Richard. I've realized that. I've watched another videos from you in youtube and realized and liked the content. I wasn't trying to be mean. Thanks :)

TL;DR ?
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:25:23
But that’s something viable ?
Do we have 21trillion on gold ?
@_date: 2017-11-20 00:39:53
What is tether ?
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:22:46
Is that a federal crime in the US ?

I like how you think
@_date: 2017-11-08 09:31:21
Dont need to wait for confirmations though

You’ll be able to buy more alcohol when moon. Smart guy. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:46:26
Wow. 21 trillions totally possible then
@_date: 2017-09-10 17:44:50
That's the point. Ill sell, not host. 
@_date: 2017-09-10 13:41:36
I mean. If you're going to buy something, a decentralized platform would be a nice place. Why not on normal web? Http. 
Using tor meana that you want to bug something illegal, dont you? That's why im notninterested. Even if you wont, someone could. 
@_date: 2017-09-10 15:07:46
I dont run those platforms though...
@_date: 2017-09-04 00:17:06

I treat my BCH as Hedge protection. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 23:50:26
Finally someone with a brain here.
@_date: 2017-09-16 12:56:05
I dont understand what is the big deal. If you need tx to be fast, raise the fee. If you dont, just use 10sat/byte. Period.

You’ll never see a ROI from mining. Only from hodling. 
@_date: 2017-09-10 00:59:40
Got it. Not interested then. Only legal.
