Ah yes, historic stories about the old "Information Superhighway." Memories...I wonder what bitcoin-related terms will sound corny in the future. "Virtual currency" perhaps? Or maybe "Alt coins"?

You're welcome. Note: Once a bill passes the House of Commons it's essentially law since its final three readings are in the un-elected, crony-filled, over-paid Canadian Senate which rubber stamps 99% of every bill it sees. But I digress.

Well written piece, D. 
Good luck with BetVIP. Solid looking site. 
FYI: I have an ongoing bet for 0.5 BTC with my buddy on the price of BTC relative to CAD. The total is set at 666. I'm taking the under. The end date is September 30. We made the bet last September.

The budget implementation bill (C-31) was actually passed by Canada's House of Commons earlier this year ( Many questions still remain unanswered, particularly with respect to what a Bitcoin dealer is. Prominent Canadian gaming lawyer Stu Hoegner, who is very active in the Bitcoin space and is a volunteer advisor to the Bitcoin Alliance of Canada, provided some excellent analysis about Bill C-31 back in March:

Although some will take offense to your comments and call you a buzzkill, you've provided some valuable insight.  While it's fun to see BTC go up in value, it certainly does feel like a bubble. Will it pop? Maybe. Personally, I'd like to see more stability, even if it is at a lower value. Stability encourages the use of Bitcoin as a medium of exchange. Right now, the steep upward trajectory is likely leading people to hoard their Bitcoin, rather than spend it. And who can blame them? Yet, this is one of the dangers of deflaton that we're often warned about.
