I really don't know what else to say other then that you are totally and completely wrong. See the 1930s as an example of what happens when currency a nation uses to facilitate all of this:


Depreciates.

I found this in r/economics, im not going to rephrase, because its a good explanation:
Because Bitcoin is constantly appreciating in value, there are immense incentives to stockpile the currency, rather than using it to procure goods and services. There is a reason that healthy economies will have low and steady inflation (i.e., the value of the money goes down over time) rather than continually increasing deflation (i.e., the value of the money goes up over time) - if the incentives create a situation where it's better to hold money than spend it, the entire system falls into a depressed state because no money is actually being spent.

This just can't happen because it's irrational. 
Perhaps you should read instead of downvoting it. Rational actors in both the macro and micro sense is a fallacy. 


Bitcoins are not being spent, they are being horded and traded for fiat. So the current trend in the market seems to blow your assertion out of the water. You got any data to back that claim up?


Fiat falls by design. Inflation lowers the value of fiat so people don't hold onto it and instead use it in the economy. If you think bitcoin is appreciating to 500 dollars and beyond because fiat is falling that rapidly I got a bridge to sell.

I think ultimately it depends on the relationship between increased computing power over time and the increasing difficulty associated with mining.
If bitcoin mining difficulty outpaces that technological growth then deflation will remain and bitcoins will not be a sound currency. Funny enough, to far in the other direction and bitcoin inflation might cause people to flee from the currency since it loses value to rapidly.

It's factually wrong. Incorrect. Not true that the military is the  


You pointing out we spend alot of money in a 17 trillion dollar economy on the military does not make that earlier statement true. 
Linking me to some random general on CNN also does not make it true. Medical costs have been the primary cause of increased debt for the last couple decades, while military spending as a percentage of GDP has actually gone down quite a bit. 


Ok? So change foreign policy. Shitting on military service members because they serve in our armed forces does not change any of this. 


Says who, you? Again, the percentage of GDP going to military spending is shirking


What a load of bullshit. Go look at the fortune 500 and tell me how many of them are owned and operated by the U.S. military. 


Ha, so I am a "statist apologist" because I disagree that the responsibility for our foreign policy lies with those who control foreign policy (elected politicians) and not military service members. What a joke. 
Nice talking to you pal.

Fuck a system that steals the hard earned value from the people's money.
Read that sentence and think how ridiculous it sounds. Now you understand that fiat money is not meant to store value over a long period of time, just like the cheeseburger is not meant to store value over a long period of time (its meant to be consumed). Invest your earned value into something that will hold it. Why is that so hard to understand?
@_date: 2013-11-18 05:39:18
Uh huh. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 17:32:14
I'll bite:


Not true. Not even remotely true. We have a extremely small portion of GDP going to the military, the biggest debt burden is rising health care costs.




I can't let this go, because it's too funny. WAKE UP SHEEPLE. 




Yea the military has nothing to do with ensuring political stability world wide, protecting trade lanes, or creating conditions for prosperity. Nothing at all. They are just a drain on the system forcing someone like you who:


To apparently work such a shit job you can't feed yourself. 
I guess you can hate on the military. That is your right as a citizen. You can also take some personal fucking responsibility for the fact that the military is controlled by you and your representatives, not some despotic general sitting in a bunker. Civilian control means we don't get to tell the troops they are monsters for doing a job we asked them to do. They follow orders. 
Also, the tone of your post and your "facts" were garbage and you sound like a scumbag.

I still don't understand his point. Dollars don't just buy computers.  
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:20:47
I don't know what else to say other then you are historically and economically wrong on this. People may spend money, but overall demand and investment falls since the currency becomes a place to store wealth.
@_date: 2013-11-18 06:21:40
Can you rephrase? I have no idea what that sentence means.
@_date: 2013-11-18 04:25:47


You would be stupid to spend something that is appreciating in value. The function of currency is to facilitate trade between people. If you have no incentive to spend the currency, it ceases being a currency in an economical sense.
