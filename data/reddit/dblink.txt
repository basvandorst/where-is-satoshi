Trade fees start at 25bps for maker/taker, and go down based on trading volume. They do pay for the tx fees, or at least I've never hit a limit.

I'm still in my 20's so my 401k savings weren't that high but I fully believe the rate of return on btc will be higher than any 401k, especially over the next 10 years. The chance to retire in my 30's compared to 70 and old is worth the gamble at this stage in my life. 
These people all came to the same conclusion. More power to them!

Exactly. If wants to use an account age argument, his is only 2 years old. You're too young to have seen how bitcoin has transformed, and how free and open this sub used to be.

... Low fees are being kicked from the mempool, not mined. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:51:51
What happens is each node can set the size of the mempool, and the first link shows a server with a normal mempool size. When that fills up it drops the lowest value transactions first to accommodate higher value. Each miner or node generally accepts ~300Mb in size.
The second link has a large server able to hold all potential transactions so it will continuously hold them. If there are no mining nodes left that have the transaction in their mempool once the queue is low enough to reach that sat/b value, and it isn't being re-broadcasted it will stay stuck as an unconfirmed transaction.

Don't forget the DNMs, they have a need for fast transactions that take 2 or 3 hops (each with their own fees) to properly be obscured and pay for illicit goods. We like to ignore them when discussing the future of bitcoin, but the markets gave bitcoin value in the first place and are the leading advocates of cryptocurrency. 
They only pay the high fees because they have to, but are working quicker than ever on implementing bch and monero.

I remember thinking the exact same thing when it jumped from 30 cents to 3 dollars years ago. Kicked myself over not pumping it all in, and look at where the price is now. Would have gotten a BTC like return. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:47:43
What about those of us that have been in bitcoin for a long time, and are encountering the same issues. I had a 313sat/b transaction take over 6 hours to get included, with a fee that was over 8% of the transaction cost.
For someone that has been using and holding btc it causes issues and doubts. I don't just want bitcoin to be a store of value but also to be useful as a transaction system. If LN fixes it then great, but soon or 18 months won't work if adoption shifts to altcoins. With the money pouring into crypto even a year without improvement will produce a very significant shift.

Let's say 1250 average transactions a block right now, including full and nearly empty ones. Around 25 cents per transaction miners get 312 dollars in fees right now. At the maximum we can only fit ~2000 transactions per block with 1mb. That necessarily limits the amount of money miners can earn. 
Now if the blocks were increased to 4mb, you could fit over 8000 transactions with a lower sat/byte when under 2mb, and then higher than current sat/byte when over 4mb. The miners would earn more money for the slightly higher risk of orphaned blocks, and users will be more inclined to send more money. People HATE fees for the most part, treating it as a necessary evil. 
Lower fees + more transactions = higher total fee pool.

You've been posting in here for years, same as me. How can you deny that the conversation has gotten more divisive and hostile to anyone outside of the Core version of bitcoin? Before it was lots of discussion and brainstorming for the good of all bitcoiners... now it really is just 1 side is right and the other side are all paid shills. You can't have a reasonable discussion anymore.

You keep saying a hard fork is bad and a non starter, why do you believe that? Bitcoin has hardforked before without issue, altcoins have shown you can do that successfully without any errors popping up or loss in confidence.

If you make a claim by refuting someone else's argument, it's on you to provide the proof. You can't just go up to someone and say "You're wrong because they have run these things before" and then when they ask for specifics tell them to find it themselves it's not your job. That's a 1 way ticket to being written off as lying. 
Plain and simple as that.

They've been making hard drives for... just over 70 years now. I wouldn't say it's at the beginning of the exponential growth curve, we're well into it. 
If you didn't see, they just announced a new 12TB 8 platter 3.5" HD, most people are still running 500gb-2tb in their home computers. How is that now a huge jump? Give it 2 years and we'll feel like 10tb is the new 500gb.
@_date: 2016-12-09 02:35:41
Although technically true, the timeline for exponential growth of storage space (not just hard drives, it will transition to other new materials in the 50-200 year timeframe). 
As a ridiculous example, let's say it's 200 years in the future and hard drive space has kept up exponentially every ~8 years (it's currently faster than that). Bitcoin gets up to 1gb blocksize, leading to 144gigs used a day or 52.5tb per year. Wow, that seems big, what's storage space going to be at? Let's start at 1tb because that's fairly standard, in 200 years it will be at... Too large of a number for my calculator. But last I got up to ~110 years from now is 3.4^52, or 10^15 zettabytes.

And then think about all the other examples out there. 8-track vs cassette, VHS vs Betamax, DVD vs Laserdisc, HDDVD vs BluRay. 
Hell, we even have 2 major used units of measurement (metric vs imperial) that still can't come to a full consensus on what to use. 
There is room for multiple cryptos just like you said, and no guarantee that BTC will be the winner (or BCH, BTG, LTC, XYZ, or anything else). In all of those examples it wasn't the technical superiority of the product that caused it to become dominant, it was the advertising and partnerships with companies that pushed 1 to the top.

It is the IRS that would investigate you, not your local PD. The IRS knows about bitcoins, you have proof that you had them, that you sold them. The exchange has your information so it can be verified, and you paid your taxes on them. Congrats, you did everything legally and will not have any trouble with the law. It's just like if someone goes gambling at a casino or wins the lottery. They suddenly win a lot of money, but the police don't come break down their door.
