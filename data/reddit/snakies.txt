Freak out much?
since when are fireworks called bombs?
He sold a product called "Pest Control Report 2000" on eBay, which is a professional or agricultural firework.
edited to describe the fireworks in question.

I don't expect anyone but me to use the bitcoin key functions actually. The random number generator is very handy however for everyone else.
@_date: 2015-12-21 20:05:27
This can be used for entertainment purposes as well, such as furtune cookie sayings, magic 8-ball answers, drink decider, party game actions, etc. But it is also a serious entropy generator and it is always with you on your wrist. I get what you are saying, the bitbabbler is good at the thing it does. I believe though, even at that one thing, my app with Band is better.
@_date: 2015-12-21 21:46:06
I wont disagree that the bitbabbler could be more secure. I cant promise that M$ doesn't somehow capture the result (I do my best to prevent it). So you are not wrong, no need to lay down on tracks.
I think my RNG is better than bitbabbler due to bitbabbler using exclusively EM noise as its source, granted various forms of EM noise. With Microsoft Band and its various sensors, I am using EM noise, environmental noise (temperature, barometric pressure, light), fluctuations in our own bodies (heart rate, skin temperature, GSR), as well as our random movements (accelerometer, gyroscope).
I think never before has such a device with so many available sensors been available in one easy package and used in this manner.
@_date: 2015-12-22 00:14:58
Im curious why you think some of the sensor data would lower entropy. Which ones? how?
@_date: 2015-12-22 22:06:41
thank you. I see you are in the security and cryptography field so I appreciate your input, but I don't think you read my OP. I start with random data from  CryptographicBuffer object, Microsoft states this RNG is for cryptography, and XOR high entropy random data on top. So to say that it shouldn't be used for crypto applications is nonsense.
@_date: 2015-12-21 19:15:26
That looks cool, but I think mine is more useful and easier to use. Plus Microsoft Band has tons of uses and will be with you at all times.
@_date: 2015-12-22 03:19:43
You would be correct if I used the outputs of the sensors directly, but I don't. As I explained in my original post, I use the changes in the values. Maybe reread the bottom of my post about John Von Neumann washing and how I apply it to all the sensor data.
@_date: 2015-12-22 21:34:43
If you have a Microsoft Band already, then it is a RNG on your wrist. My app is a serious RNG, but also it has entertainment purposes. To name a few of the types of random data Chancy will provide: roll dice, flip a coin, fortune cookie, magic 8-ball, lottery numbers, playing card deck, party dice, drink decider, GUID, etc.

I dont want to sound like a douche but I think you have the ripmd160 and sha-256 reversed.  I believe it would be

It would be hard! Thats not how double spending works!  The bitcoin network rejects any second attempt at spending the same output regardless if this second attempt offers more in fees.  If you write custom code to spend an output but dont include fees, then an instant later transmit the spending of the same output but include fees, any node that has already received the first transaction will automatically ignore the second transaction.  They do not trash the first just because someone pays more for the same spend.  This would be bad!
It is much harder to double spend than you think.  In this vimeo example, you would have to send the first transaction and wait until it is received by the bitcoin node that is being monitored by vimeo, gaining you access to the video.  Then you would send the second transaction (the double spend) to a different part of the bitcoin network that you hope has not yet received your first transaction, then you hope that this second transaction spreads to more nodes than your first transaction or nodes more likely to solve the next block.  Whichever transaction arrived first to the node that announces the next block solution is the winning transaction, and since you want to cheat vimeo, you hope it is the second transaction which is spending your output to an address you possess.  This is the basics and there are ways to improve your odds that this happens in your favor, but it is not as easy as you might think.

ahhh! right you are!
@_date: 2014-11-17 19:03:40
I believe you can use your trazor with GreenAddress.it wallet
@_date: 2015-05-14 17:46:57
is $10 the most you can have? id like to load up like $50 on the same card if possible.
@_date: 2015-01-23 18:10:17
will you have an app for windows phone 8.1 or 10?
@_date: 2015-01-15 00:12:20
Any updates on the Bitcoincard?
@_date: 2015-05-22 23:18:37
agreed. looks like fancy ponzi scheme. beware
@_date: 2015-08-28 18:27:12
I use Copay as well. It is good with lots of features. Could be better if it wasnt all web views.
@_date: 2015-07-20 05:37:36
It seems you can keep your 3rd key private from Case; they require you to provide the extended public key of the 3rd key only.
I want to know if I can input my own extended private key into the case hardware wallet (the "possession key"). Also I want to know if the extended private key on the device is ever revealed to Case.
I have to be the ONLY person to know 2 of the 3 keys for me to even consider using this.
If I can provide 2 of the 3 keys from generation methods that I control, I will definitely be getting one of these.

Looks great!

Windows Phone app please.

They come in pints?? Im gettin one!
@_date: 2015-02-11 18:38:41
These are pretty cool.  I would get a BIP38 encrypted one from them, no problem.... but how can you ever trust them with your Armory root key or fragmented backup keys?  I wish there was some way to trust them, as these would be awesome for the purpose of keeping/passing on your bitcoin to your estate.

I have used wells fargo bank for 15+ years for all my banking, mortgages, etc.  I buy BTC every week using coinbase linked to my checking account.  I have been doing this since coinbase was founded.  not one peep from the bank yet.

This poster did go through a lot of trouble in this case... photoshoping the previous picture and put the new value on it.  Im feeling as though this is a trick now also.  I wish the original poster would say something.

mind posting the transaction id?
@_date: 2013-11-09 18:47:26
not true.  ownersalt is included in the encrypted key. byte 7-14
edit: you beat me m4ge123
@_date: 2013-11-09 06:18:03
im out.  this will take 308 years according to my setup. or 201 days if I exclude alphanumeric characters and only use the weird Unicode symbols.
@_date: 2013-10-08 22:15:33
Just cancel your pending orders and try to sell again.  They are only reserved because you have an order already to sell them but most likely the price has dropped to below your order price.

Throwing my hat in the race. C# parallel implementation checking all keyboard characters including symbols running at 1.1 attempts/sec on 6 core computer.  Estimating 2 days to test all possible combinations. I might be able to get more speed.

I want to submit a claim with Paypal now. Can you tell me how BFL is violating paypals TOS and FTC guidelines?  I need this info to argue effectively.
@_date: 2013-11-09 15:32:22
Guys! He revealed the first character and that the set is Unicode. I gave up because I don't want to spend a few of my life times trying to win .2btc
@_date: 2013-11-09 16:03:00
Its one of the Unicode arrows, the double arrow. Don't remember the code. He made a second thread talking about it.
@_date: 2013-10-18 15:37:21
I see an update came out today. Can you list the fixes? I noticed my blockchain wallet balance now updates correctly. Did you fix the bug where someone could access the send coins page bypassing the wallet PIN?
@_date: 2013-11-12 17:56:17
probably op took it back along with the extra that was donated to the contest.  op has been surprisingly quiet the last few days.
@_date: 2013-11-09 18:24:47
Good point!
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:32:41
Obviously you haven't done much research on bitcoin or you would know that there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins. Not an infinite supply.
