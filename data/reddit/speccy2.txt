A recent comment of yours in brought me here.


I thought it was Thackeray (although not in the modern sense), and Marx the first to use 'capitalist'.


There is no meaningful distinction - they are simply two different kinds of property rights.


That seems ahistorical. A minority class has always owned most property (well, since at least the neolithic revolution). It's not like everything was nice and equal before capitalism.


Work is necessary regardless of socio-economic system. Thus your comment about workers not making a voluntary decision is true only in the trivial sense.


Not sure what 'unskilled' is doing in there, but anyway, this is empirically false. If it were true, then wages would never go up.


This is true. It's also the reason there is so much property to be coveted in the first place - capital accumulation (the basis of progress) is only possible with secure property rights.


Is an oxymoron.
