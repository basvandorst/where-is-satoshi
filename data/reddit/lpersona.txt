Usecripto does not trade in Brazilian Reais (the local currency) so it does not reflect the brazilian market.

Lies... unless OP is planning to buy a lot, volume is under 500BTC and decreasing.

why do you say the data is unreliable? are you talking that the trades showing up on their feed are not actually real trades? based on what?
what makes other exchanges data reliable but not those?
@_date: 2015-06-01 23:59:39
Thank you for the shout out! I maintain the website  and collect this info from all Brazilian exchanges.
Some additional data, 2015 already had more BTC exchanged than the entire year of 2014, but is still behind in total value (R$ BRL)
5-month volume in 2015: **R$ 28.5M ($9.5M USD) and 37.7k BTCs** 
2014 volume: **R$ 42.5M ($14.1M USD) and 34k BTCs**
Another interesting stats is that the average trade size in May is larger than every other month, showing that either buyers/sellers are more confident in transacting larger amounts which can show an increase of confidence as an investment option, or some big traders have entered the market forcing bigger swings.
The top 2 exchanges in volume keep changing places showing that competition is strong, with a 3rd exchange closing the gap.
From a fee earnings perspective, that is still incipient showing that exchanges are probably still operating in the red, as the total trade fees collected in May was around R$ 47k ($15k)

the reason I believe is because some exchange changed their hot wallet max size for withdraws to 1000 BTC.
So now all withdraws have a large chain that starts with 1000BTCs and keeps increasing the total transaction volume even though most withdraws are very small.
This may be a change due to the full blocks where they want to have priority over other transactions by having larger than average tx amount and reducing the number of times they need to merge change addresses when the wallet gets emptied. Both strategies reduce fees expenses.
Follow this chain for example: 
@_date: 2016-01-18 23:41:57


But on a chained transaction (1 parent, 24 children) I only need to replace 1 fee (the parent) and all children will automatically become invalid right?
So if you create 3000 parent txs that have combined 72,000 children txs, couldn't you fill the mempool and then issue just 3,000 RBF to make all other 72k txs drop?

This code here doesn't seem to do anything evil.
It first does a basic key cleaning (find/replace all zeroes and O's to "o" and I's and l's to "1".
Then it goes through your known private key and changes each character with one of the other available options within "123456789ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijkmnopqrstuvwxyz"
Finally, it creates 3000 calls to electrum, each passing a possible private key and run that script (key_scan.sh).
I'd use a clean electrum/wallet install before doing this as you'd ended up with a very large set of new address that you may never use. Backup your old/current wallet.
good luck!
as a side note, because the script doesn't check if the letter it's using to substitute another one in your original key are the same, you'll end up with a few repeated keys on your file. Not sure if electrum will throw some error messages if you try to restore a private key it already has.

I've done a few tests recently with transactions ranging from 0.001 to 0.0002, medium-priority (very old dust) and less than 1MB in size.
Results have been all over the place. Some txs confirmed within 3 to 5 blocks. Others took 2 or 3 days. I still have two unconfirmed after over a month (yes - I keep rebroadcasting it to see if they ever make through).
It seems that if your coins are old enough or a big enough amount to achieve higher priority under current rules, it may go through without a fee. Once 0.12 comes out though, that will stop working.

"unless your paying a lot more money"
Linode is $160/month for 368GB. DO is $320 for 320GB.
Hetzner has dedicated servers for half that and terabyte of storage.
Not sure about your costs of running the ATMs but for this type of business I'd consider $200-300/mo a small expense for a serious service.
@_date: 2016-01-15 05:45:44
Last 12 blocks were full and the current size of the mempool is over 6MB which means the next 6 blocks (1hr) will also be full. So unless you throw some pretty high fee, gotta wait.
@_date: 2016-06-07 21:42:47
Yes - there are a few hurdles. The 660USD is based on the commercial/official bank exchange rate. Except large contracts/agreements, nobody will get those rates when buying dollars.
Considering the official rate + fees + capital control taxes, the exchange rate would make the BTC price closer to 620USD. Still a premium.
There is an additional hurdle to transfer money out and into an international exchange.
Historically, the spread has reduced over time (in percentual points) and tend to get lower during periods of low volatility in the international markets.

You are correct. FoxBit had only 15% trades than Mercado but moved  62% more money.
@_date: 2015-08-08 03:03:01
Because of the higher average trade value in FoxBit. Their system integrates with other global exchanges so I believe it can be easily used for remittance which involves higher average trade value.
Another view is that it's being used more by investors than small/regular bitcoin users.

nope, haven't - i work hard and let the report do most of the talking :)

The report considers an entire trade with both parties as just one and the same thing. So 10 btc sold and purchased equals to 10 btc in total volume (not 20 btc).
Considering exchanges are intermediaries (don't buy and sell themselves) you couldn't have someone selling and no one buying...
@_date: 2015-08-07 15:53:30
It's been mostly a steady growth. The last 2 months had more volume than the entire year of 2013. The last 7 months had more than 2014.
So it's around a 3x/year growth rate. Not an explosive/extremely exponential growth, but shows a bit of market trend.
@_date: 2016-02-06 02:10:21
The volume reported by LocalBitcoins is already included on the report and represents less than 3%. A few "traders" use a mix of p2p and exchanges as way of trading and that's why all numbers are consolidated.

What's the model after beta? Are initial customers grandfathered? How do you make money?
@_date: 2015-09-02 00:16:20
There are some but not much. You can already use it to pay some bills or add pre-paid mobile credits.
But also, if you subscribe something internationally (say a VPS or buy digital things) it's easier/cheaper then going the international credit card route.

A key concern after having such a strong July (38% higher than previous high) was to know if that would be sustainable and consistent.
August numbers coming in so close to July all-time-high, gives some indication that this new volume level is not just an one off thing.

all exchanges charge trade fees. and are expected to pay taxes on those. so providing fake trades could be quite costly for them.
