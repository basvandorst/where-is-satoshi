And that’s gonna warrant a trillion $ valuation?

I have never been asked for verification until now(had to give them my life story and take pics of my drivers license or they wouldn’t let me transfer over bitcoin.  What type of future speculation? Bitcoin had practical uses for privacy  and now that doesn’t exist and uses for online vices. Which is now showing more irrelevant based on the new law that will allow sports gambling.

Maybe this why the transactions have fallen off a cliff and the value has lost 60 percent?

Okay? But  what are the bitcoin price drivers? Obviously transactions? Valuation? Transactions have fallen off a cliff from 500k a day to 200k a day..

Using a local guy is gonna make bitcoin worth a trillion $? Lol

I honestly thought bitcoins advantages were privacy, annomity and illegal vices. Wow, how wrong I was. Explains huge drop in demand. I was in shock when they asked for my license and SS. Almost felt like McDonald’s got rid of hamburgers.

The exchange controls transaction though. Bitcoin prices have a strong correlation with transactions? Without sports betting online now and more security. Transactions should fall off a cliff? If I can just go to bw3 to bet now I don’t need to use bitcoin.

Why are daily transactions down from 500k when I was 20,000 a coin to 200k transactions now at $8500?

I have no idea what you are saying. I have never had a problem liquidating my bitcoin from a sports book to coinbase. I’m just pointing out serious things that could affect bitcoin transaction demand which looks to be correlated to bitcoin prices. Any non biased  response would be appreciated

I'm serious. Who is in it to win it as is convicted. Someone on here has to be adding to position for years and not selling.
