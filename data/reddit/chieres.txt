Proof of work - whoever solves the hash faster gets to keep the coins. Rest eats the dust, accepts it and starts mining the next block.


Hard cap is enforced indirectly by reward in each block. It started from 50 BTC per block and every 210 000 blocks it is halved and at some point it will be 0, thus making the supply approximately 21M.
It is part of the consensus rules and if someone will try to mine a block with more coins than expected - block will be rejected.

With 10k you should definitely get a hardware wallet. 
Not sure about best exchanges for Canada but I guess GDAX should be fine as well. 
One advice - don’t send everything at once to your wallet from exchange. Send like 100$ to see how it works, try restoring the wallet from the seed. A lot of new people make silly mistakes and lose money forever. Get confident - then send the rest.

If it replaces fiat it will mean price growth will be at most ~5% per year. Probably even less.

Min*ers* are getting a bad rep not mining in general, and a very specific group of them to be precise. And I don’t think they give a shit what people say with all the sweet profits they are reaping. 
Mining is fine, it just takes time to get your investments back and with crypto uncertainty you never know if you’ll be able to profit in the end. 
When you just buy coins instead - you don’t have any liability, you can just sell all your coins where ever you want. 
But mining has definite advantages. As price grows - your profitability will grow faster than from direct investment. You receive anonymous coins. Depending on your electricity situation you may be getting coins cheaper. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 16:57:46
It’s a Blockfolio app, it converts all the prices into one preset currency, so in this case prices should be the same.
e.g. if you select USD as your currency and add BTCEUR and BTCUSD pairs tied to some exchange it will show ~8000$ for both.
@_date: 2017-11-30 08:30:22
The goal is to never sell it for money. Only sell it for goods you want to buy.

You need to know how to receive (give your address or QR code to someone) and how to send (input address and amount into your wallet app). Those are not difficult concepts to grasp.
You don't need to understand every bit about bitcoin to use it. Bitcoin is trustless but it doesn't mean you can't trust anyone, it means whenever you don't trust anyone - you can verify legitimacy yourself.  You can also choose to entrust verification of everything to the community if you lack specialization. If your family and half a city uses app X to exchange bitcoin, you can check the source code yourself or you can trust them (implying that some of them checked it) and use it as well. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 06:15:07

ELI5: Imagine you have a dollar bill. And you want to buy an apple from Jane which costs 1$. 
Then you draw a line in a middle of it and announce that one side is 1USD and other side is 1USX.
With replay protection you would cut it in half and could pay to Jane 1 USD and keep 1 USX to yourself.
Without replay protection you don't cut it and pay Jane the whole dollar bill, so both 1USD and 1USX.
If you don't care about USX - you have nothing to worry about, you still have all your money, you just will always spend both of them  whenever you spend your USD. But if you do care about both, you should not spend any, until there is a clear way to separate them.

Swings will fade away with capitalization growth. As soon as it can reach the valuation numbers of a major currency - you won't be able to sway the market that easily.
Currently $1M dollar worth of bitcoin trade changes the price roughly by 1%. 
Can you drop USD value by 1% if you sell $1M for EUR? No. But it is not because it's backed by US government, it is because $1M is nothing on a global scale.

You can't lose them if you don't spend them in the time of uncertainty, can you?


Again, if you don't spend until everything is clarified you have both, don't you?


If you can mine 10x more coins that have 1/20 of the value, it's pointless. So B2X not necessarily will be a more profitable coin for them.
On top of that - users give the coin value, not miners. Difficulty will adjust to any amount of miners available. In the worst case scenario PoW can be made incompatible with ASIC, if I'm not mistaken, and GPU miners all over the world will pick up the pace since most people would rather mine bitcoin than another "new hot shitcoin" that will die in a year.

By the time bitcoin is that mainstream price will be stabilized.
But that is far away since we're talking about end-to-end adoption, where you get paid in bitcoin, you can spend them on goods, your employer earns bitcoin by selling services in bitcoin and buying supplies in bitcoin.
How exactly does it happen? Quite easy really, imagine an entrepreneur that owns 1M$ worth of bitcoin who decides to start some whatever startup. He hires 2 programmers and pays their salary in bitcoin. He then sells his services for bitcoin only, never exchanging to fiat. Yes, at first every customer who doesn't have bitcoin needs to use exchange, but at some point customer can also get a job that pays in bitcoin and never exchange, and so forth.
It's a self accelerating cycle really. The more vendors accept bitcoin - the more people would want to use it. The more people own it and are willing to spend it - the more vendors would want to accept it. It's all about critical mass.

It combines the advantages of a savings account/gold and cash/debit account.
If you can be sure that your stash is not losing value and even gaining some, and you can spend your money any second on any purchase - that's more than enough for most people. 
Not everyone is an investor. IMO trading is only so popular today because inflation punishes you for keeping your money to yourself, and because savings account rates are usually minuscule. 
If there was a safe, easy way to store your value people would gladly use it.

Even in it's current form bitcoin is already infinitely more divisible than gold. Even at the price of 1M$ one satoshi is still 0.01$ which is perfectly usable. And we're not reaching this price in a lifetime (if ever).
Using a gram of gold is already very impractical to use both in terms of price and utility, I don't see how you could divide it even further without using some find of representation currency, which brings us back paper money.
And why would future division of bitcoin would go against it's fundamentals?

@_date: 2017-10-13 11:56:23
That's a moot point. 
First of all, if Bitcoin replaces money - yearly growth will be less than 5%, since without new people getting into it the value can only grow with the economy/population growth. 
Even if you imagine crazy growth like x10 every year - it is only applicable if you have something else to spend. It is regrettable to see that pizza costed a million dollars not because Bitcoin increased in value, but because dollar didn't. You were left with something that stayed the same, while something else became valuable. And it's easy to see this on the example.
let's say it's year 0, Bitcoin is worth 1$ and price is multiplying tenfold every year. 
let's say you have $100 dollars to your name and you buy $10 pizza every year.
Now in your case you have let's say 20% of your worth in bitcoin, so 20 BTC and 80$. 
If you decide to pay for pizza in Bitcoin your balance will look like that:
* Year 0 - 10 BTC + $80 (10$ 10 BTC pizza)
* Year 1 - 9 BTC + $80 (10$ 1 BTC pizza)
* Year 2 - 8.9 BTC + $80 (10$ 0.1 BTC pizza)
* Year 3 - 8.89 BTC + $80 (10$ 0.01 BTC pizza)
So now your balance is equivalent of $8 890 + $80. If you think back you see that you could have saved 20 BTC and payed in cash, and you would have $20 000 +  $40. That's your point - why would anyone spend BTC then?
BUT if you get rid of cash equivalent and only have 100 BTC. 
Your balance will look like that:
* Year 0 - 90 BTC (10$ 10 BTC pizza)
* Year 1 - 89 BTC (10$ 1 BTC pizza)
* Year 2 - 88.9 BTC (10$ 0.1 BTC pizza)
* Year 3 - 88.89 BTC (10$ 0.01 BTC pizza)
So now your balance is equivalent of $88 890. And now you could think that you could have $100 000 if you didn't buy the pizza in year 0, but now it's completely irrelevant since you payed for the goods you wanted at the appropriate price at the time and there's no alternative way to buy it cheaper.

What realistically gives me confidence:
* Peer-to-peer bitcoin transactions can not be banned without VERY tyranical measures
* It's still works as usual, I can still transfer value, NOTHING that affects bitcoin itself has happened.
* There's so much money invested in VERY SPECIFIC miners at this point, that it can't just crash.  If it was GPU mining - everyone can just switch to a next shitcoin, not with ASIC. Miners will keep the price up above a certain level to survive (if McAfee to be trusted and 1 bitcoin is indeed worth $1k in electricity, price should not fall below 1500-2000, considering ROI, maintenance and profits).
Anyways I did not invest to get some profits, I invested in ideology and, more importantly, I did not invest something I was not ready to lose. So market fluctuations don't bother me in a slightest and I think many HODLers share my sentiment.
And while we're here why not have some fun in the process, hence the optimism and memes.

Yes, it generates a wallet for every passphrase, including "empty passphrase" one. You can even disable the passphrase so it won't prompt it, effectively hiding your wallet completely.
Also you can keep your seed words in an order only you understand for additional protection. E.g write them in a 5x5 square in a spiral or some shit. Trevor FAQ mentions that bruteforcing just the order of the known words would take over 3 years. 
Even putting one word out of place if not makes it impossible to use, will definitely give you enough time to discover theft and transfer funds.

He can lose in two cases: if he wants to sell but price will drop below 4800 faster than he will be able to sell, which is possible but requires him not paying attention. Or if he'll notice a downtrend and decide not to sell and it goes to 0, bringing death of crypto, which is highly unlikely with current stakes.

That is true but what it your point exactly? I think most people are not delusional and realize that you can't have a 10x increase every year forever.
But capital gain is not the main advantage of bitcoin over fiat it's just a side effect. But even if you ignore other benefits, currency that increases 2% every year is still better than currency that loses 2% every year. And it's not a savings account kind of increase, where your money are locked for a year, and if you need them earlier you lose all the gain.

You're mixing exchanges and cost of usage in a pile here. Let's look at them one by one.


Technically exchanges are not "part of bitcoin". Ideally you do not deal with them when bitcoin has matured enough to get your salary in bitcoin. 
Having said that, we need to deal with them now, but since you don't mention fiat exchanges, which are also expensive, I assume you either never left Canada or didn't put much though into exchange costs.
According to [exchange rates]( you can sell CAD for USD at 0.78995 rate and buy it back at 0.83368. That's a 5% difference right there, which gives us ~2.5% fee on each conversion since actual price is somewhere on the middle. And that is your neighbor country - other countries should have even higher fees.
So we get 2.5% fee while exchanging two major world currencies, which have been comparatively stable for years. You can't expect bitcoin with 30% overnight swings to have small fees. Exchange fees will get smaller as volatility decreases and eventually we won't need exchanges at all. On top of that, just like people mentioned here, coinbase is one of the most expensive ways to buy crypto.


Bitcoin gave everyone who had it last year way more than 1%. Even when all coins are mined and everyone in the world adopted bitcoin there's still ~1-3% growth every year due to the nature of deflating currency.


Bitcoin is like a flat fee debit card where you always pay 0.1% on every purchase versus a debit card where you pay a million of hidden fees. Cost of banking is hidden but it's in everything you buy. You lose all of your savings constantly due to inflation. Cost of banking is included in every product and service. Cost of banks collapsing and people losing their life savings is included there as well.
Bitcoin is certainly still in development. And it's still not there for domestic utility. But when you take international scale - it's already delivering amazing value.
@_date: 2017-09-13 08:34:23

It still doesn't have any big players on board so far, at least officially. The market cap is tiny - it's at ~1% compared to gold. If it steals just 10% of the gold market - price will increase tenfold. It only recently surpassed the net worth on Bill Gates. Think about it - just one person was still worth more than all of the bitcoin combined.
If any one of the likes of Goldman Sachs will decide to officially enter the market - it will start a chain reaction. I'm not saying it will certainly happen, but if it does - 100k+ is not unreasonable at all.

2) Obviously, that's why the crypto market is so uncertain.

And why do they want it? Maybe because they can use it someday?


Unless we speaking hyperinflation, people buy stuff when they need or want stuff, not to just get rid of money. Why would merchant accept any kind of money then?


And in the end no one accepts bitcoin and you can't spend it anywhere. Wow, what an achievement. 


Lol, yeah. Totally not the achievement of big players like Microsoft and Expedia getting into the game, no. I mean there's a lot of people who think their 1.5 BTC will become $1.5 million in 2 years pushing the price, but the only thing they're achieving is creating an unsustainable bubble.

I feel like mobile wallets already have most of that and the optimal middle ground between full control of your keys, and going all in with an online wallet.
Using Breadwallet as an example (since I find it the most user friendly on iOS), you download an app, you're given a seed to back up, and you set up a pin (which it then hides behind a Touch ID). That's pretty much it. 
You don't trust anyone with your private keys, but you also don't need to manage it manually, it's all stored in a very secure way on your device.
You need to send money - you open an app, scan qr code and use Touch ID to authorize. Done.

They are not related. In case of trezor wallet passphrase acts basically like a 25th seed word which you never write down. So without it, seed words are useless.
In regards to scrambling - I'm not an expert on bruteforcing but I think writing the words in some particular pattern should be sufficient for most people.
24 seed words written in multiple lines can form 6x4 rectangle, or 5x5(-1) square for example. And then you can just connect the dots in an order that you will remember (just like android screen unlock).
Additionally you can write them in reverse, put some fake words in it, or switch every third word, or some shit like that, as long as it's easy to remember and hard to predict.

In case of "artificial drop" traders start pumping towards 5k levels by the end of October to then crash it back to 4k. Price-wise we're at the same level as in the previous case, but combined panic of fork and 5k-&gt;4k drop drops it way below 3500 this time.

I agree that there are a lot of sides to bitcoin being unfriendly, I only disagree that bitcoin is "technologically unfriendly". 
All the apps, QR codes and such may be a problem for someone who is 60 years old, but bitcoin is far from mainstream currently and I don't want to sound dark or disrespectful, but most 60-70 year old people will be economically irrelevant in 10-20 years. Young people live with technology from young age nowadays and it's up to them to adopt bitcoin.

If you want to save - you'll save, no matter what. You'll buy different currency, gold, whatever the go-to store of value at the time.
Spending stimulation IMO is one of the worst arguments for the inflatory currency 
@_date: 2017-10-02 10:37:15
Because the more you can spend - the more you are comfortable to transfer into BTC.
If you always put 10% of your paycheck in bitcoin just to hold and let's say you have rent on 15'th every month. 
If you are condident that you can pay your rent in BTC - you can instead put 10% + rent into BTC every month. So it has 15 days to increase in price and then you pay for rent and have something left over.
@_date: 2017-10-09 12:08:10
There will for sure be a sell off, traders still exist. 
If no major news will land, it will climb till the fork dates, drop after fork to around 4k-ish, and will pull back and stabilize at around 4500. 
That's my absolutely out-of-the-ass prediction. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 17:36:18

@_date: 2017-10-15 21:46:35
That depends on how you replace. If you top up from coinbase after every purchase - it will obviously be a huge waste. 
But if you exchange 10% of your paycheck into bitcoin monthly anyway and you know that you can pay, for example, rent in BTC - you can just exchange a bigger amount initially. 
The more you are able to spend in BTC - the bigger chunk of the paycheck it’s safe to exchange.

devs can be pro whatever, resulting product is what actually matters.
If you said "Beware, breadwallet developers support 2X, although their product still allows you to support any chain you want" I'd completely agree with you, but instead you said "He is asking for wallets not supporting s2x. The breadwallet does." which is simply not true.


When this actually happens I will change my mind - Breadwallet is open source in case you forgot.

Bread adoption should have a pretty big influence. They've mentioned that it's in the works.
@_date: 2017-10-13 06:07:38
The idea is not to “cash out” though. Idea is to live off bitcoin. We should get rid of the mindset of exchanging bitcoin for “real money”.
If you want to buy something - it’s perfectly fine. Holding till you’re 70 is all kinds of pointless. But cashing out just for the sole purpose of “fixing the profit” while reasonable now (due to uncertain market), is not how it’s supposed to be.

Hold as opposed to panicking and trying to predict the market. 
You can't use something as currency if it goes from 3000 to 5000 and back to 3000 in a matter of weeks. Holding stabilizes the price and encourages adoption.

Judging by your other responses he just wants to gamble and have fun. I feel like it won’t be a tragedy if he loses some money. Just tell him to be reasonable with amounts.
Having said that I think price won’t drop until there will be a safe way to sell B2X. Then there will be a bit of a sell off. 
So either get in at the end of November or now.

It also highly depends on the adoption state of Bitcoin in your country. 
It's easy to do if Bitcoin is adopted by small amount of people and the government is strong - see China. They can effectively ban everything related to Bitcoin and will make it impossible to be viable there. (I don't think they'll do it, but they definitely can) 
But if government is falling apart or/and adoption is big enough to greatly weaken the official currency (possibly future Venezuela), then there's a tipping point in power and wealth distribution. Police enforcement needs money to exist. And if you pay with currency that will lose 80% of the value next week, and that "mining coalition guy" over there pays in Bitcoin for protection, then why would people chose the losing side.

Not really. Miners can skip transaction validation entirely in theory (they risk their block getting rejected if it contains invalid transactions, but it's possible).
The role of miners is:
* mint new coins
* make sure everyone gets the same block. It's pretty much a sophisticated timestamping.
