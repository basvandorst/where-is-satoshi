Is it? I don't know anything about which rankings are the best, but looking at [Wikipedia]( the index involving the British think tank ranks London highest. The one involving the Americans ranks New York highest.
Both of them seem to have a fairly solid claim. It basically just boils down to which city you'd personally rather consider the financial capital of the world, as far as I can tell.

You could look at it as the limit of x/x as x goes to 0, which is obviously 1 since x/x = 1. But lim (a,b) -&gt; (0,0) a/b doesn't exist, it takes different values. Depending on the direction you take the limit, it could be plus or minus infinity, zero or 1.
There's no logical answer, it's just undefined.

One day you're going through some old things in the attic and...what's this? You find a hard drive. Haha, I wonder what's on it, probably some old porn. It'd be a real nostalgia trip to find out, right?
So you find a SATA to IDE converter you had lying around, you plug in it, the filesystem's still ok, surprisingly. You go to the home directory and look around:
    $ ls -a
    .
    ..
    .bashrc
    .bitcoin/
    .cache/
WAIT a second, is this your big break? Is this the day you find out you're a billionaire??
    $ file .bitcoin/wallet.dat
    file: cannot access .bitcoin/wallet.dat: Input/output error
Then you hear a grinding noise and are unable to mount the disk again. Then you kill yourself, I guess.
It's not like this happened to me with a CD with "Bitcoin wallet" written on it, I'm not bitter. Jesus christ....

The thing is, the closer we get to September 30, we will see a lot of people panic selling. I don't think it's unreasonable to say that we haven't seen the bottom yet.
I do think that he should STFU or even better for him, start telling people to "HODL" and "buy the dip" if he wants to maximize his own profits.
