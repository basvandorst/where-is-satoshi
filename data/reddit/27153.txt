I really wish the talking heads would follow some sort of debating procedure. It is insufferable the manner in which they fight to talk over each other. If they would let each other speak, everyone could make their points better while also having the benefit of not sounding like an ass.

Isn't it important to see mainstream companies like Square offering Bitcoin services? Most people in the US don't know what Coinbase it; in comparison, most people do know what Square is. In order to pave the way for more mainstream adoption it's necessary for people to learn about Bitcoin in the first place.

Not everyone can afford to travel and buy tickets to every game they want to see. In fact, almost no one can. Especially if you're a fan of a team that plays on a different continent than the one you live on.

Don't other cryptos have better specs for small transfers and payments compared to Bitcoin? Or is LN going to be enough to make Bitcoin competitive in this regard?
