Um.. ok, hopefully if I can explain what's going on here you can help a little more. If any part of this makes no sense, feel free to say so and I'll try to help out. 
So, my ChangeTip account had .1BTC from yesterday in it. I sort of figured out what you said yesterday and completed the transaction. Only issue is that for whatever reason, that money was split to two accounts, one was my wallet, one was some random wallet. The random got almost all but $.03 worth of BTC, which was what I ended up with in my Coinbase wallet.
Today, if you look below, someone tipped me the same amount. So, I follow your directions, aaand the same thing happened.
If I look at my [ChangeTip withdrawl history]( first of all there's three transactions, all for .1 BTC. The bottom one is from one address to two addresses for a total of $3.65. The middle one is from one address to two addresses, one of which is my CoinBase wallet which only got 3 cents worth of BTC, for a total of $28.80. The top one is from one address (btw these one addresses are different every time) to two addresses, one of which is my CoinBase wallet which only got 3 cents worth of BTC, for a total of $62.20.
So my ChangeTip wallet has nothing, my CoinBase wallet has, well will have one the second transaction finishes pending, 0.0002 BTC (6 cents), and I've no bloody clue where the rest went.
All I want to do is turn my tipped BTC into USD and put it in my bank... lol

Huh. Interesting. 
The only real research I've done into BitCoin was about mining, so I have/had no idea how any of the internals or anything worked. Thank you!

Ohhhh... didn't see the m there... i r wicked smaht. lol Thank you
But why were the transaction sizes so large? I mean if I send a tip to my wallet and it's only 3 cent's worth, what's the other $20+?

I noticed that over the last two weeks the price of bitcoin has gone up 17%. As an investment, I just bought $1000 worth of bitcoin (I think it's like 3.38BTC). What are the chances of it actually paying off? I'm all for risky investments, but that's also why I put next to nothing into it. 
Also, just out of curiosity, is Coinbase the easiest/best way to buy/sell bitcoin if it's already set up?

As someone who just threw $1000 at bitcoins: oh dear, this'll be fun...
