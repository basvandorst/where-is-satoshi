I used it once, but it was more hassle than simply doing a on-chain transaction. It worked, but I didn't understand why I had to open up a payment channel and if I had to trust that channel or not? They YouTube video didn't recommend using the random node option but to use some trusted node option? I thought lightning was trustless but somehow I do need to trust this lightning channel, don't I? Was a bit too complicated for me, I don't want to know the underlying technology to be able to do make a transaction safely.
I'm a bit worried because on-chain BTC transactions can't really compete in terms of transaction costs and lightning transactions can't compete in terms of ease of use compared to Dash, Monero or BCash.
@_date: 2019-07-08 07:11:10
But my question was more about if it's so easy to switch to another channel in case the primary one goes down and lightning wallets is all about ease of use, why even have the option at all and just make the channels completely transparent to the user so they don't have to understand yet another mechanism that they don't need to care about?

What happens if it's not? Will my wallet automatically find a new one automatically without any user interaction and make a instant transaction anyway? If so, what's the point of even asking the user what node it wants to use and just choose one at random?

What? There are courses which are free for non-european citizens? You haven't even paid taxes, how could they make that free?
Where i live (Sweden) if you want to study abroad you can ask for support to pay your tuition fees, but it's pretty much never enough to support the whole amount.

I would much rather go for a Odroid C1 than a Banana pi, it's also cheaper and costs just 35$. If you want raw performance i would always go for a odroid c1, but the rpi community just has so much great stuff going on.

Hello Frank. I've actually been using Kraken since my switch from Coinbase and have been very satisfied.
The only thing I'm really missing is the ability to manually set the transaction fee when withdrawing to a wallet. Is this something you are considering or will it continue to be hardcoded?
Otherwise, keep up the good work!

What's the use-case for having a satellite dish for receiving bitcoin blocks?
Isn't 3G fast enough for this and where 3G isn't available I assume that region to either be uninhabited or too poor to buy a satellite dish and a computer? What am I missing?
@_date: 2019-03-02 14:53:56
About time, Coinbase has been shit for many years now. I switched 1.5 years ago and I considered myself late on switching.
@_date: 2019-03-04 06:45:21
Kraken, far from perfect but their track record is very good and their site is reliable nowadays.
Only thing I'm missing is the ability to manually set the transaction fee when withdrawing. The UI is still also pretty bad but it works fine.

Since bitcoin debit cards generally only can exchange to GBP, USD and EUR without a conversion fee, i certainly wouldn't want to use it in countries like Sweden, Denmark(+Greenland), Norway, Iceland etc. since that would mean ~3% fee on every transaction with the card.

The bible is the closest thing we have to prove that Jesus existed, that doesn't mean its necessarily the truth.






From looking at [ and [ you can see that neither remove a huge amount of submissions. I haven't look much at the comments but it seems like it's approximately the same amount of deletions there as well, from some quick glances it was usually between 2-9% on both subreddits on a few posts on the top posts this year, so it's definitely not unusual with deleted comments on both subreddits.
@_date: 2019-08-20 10:01:00
Thats not proof... How can you be sure that was his last post? I would assume that the last post he made would have been deleted by the mods. He made multiple comments on r/btc the same week, it's not unlikely that he wrote a few more which were deleted.
The shitty reason for the ban is enough to know that the mods don't do a very good job though.
@_date: 2019-08-19 12:36:09
It's proof that you got banned, but it's not proof that it was about you posting about the lightning network.
What does "Website comment spam" even mean? That's an unclear reason for a ban...

Have you heard someone call an app or program "bloated"?
Adding lots of features into one app makes apps bloated, what should be done is to have multiple apps which can integrate with each other.
Add built-in support for bitcoin tips in the reddit app is a decent idea, adding a whole wallet to it is stupid.

Of course he doesn't, he just stated that he doesn't understand it.

I stopped using bitcoin to buy things such as games on steam and ordering electronics online when the fees started to get ridiculous about half a year ago. It's simply not worth it anymore sadly.

Patong beach is among the most popular tourist beaches in all of Thailand and is expensive (relatively at least). It's easy to find good restaurants with live music and great food for half the price. Considering that it's Patong breach though the price is about average, but it is certainly not cheap for being Thailand.

A blockchain is literally just the definition of what bitcoin uses for recording its transactions, blocks of data in a chain. There are hundreds of different cryptos which are also use the blockchain design but where consensus algorithms, blocksize, blocktime, dataformat and the rest of the APIs work completely differently. Technically a blockchain doesn't even need to contain transactions.
@_date: 2019-01-23 13:26:56


Are you being sarcastic? Because that's the stupidest thing I've heard in a long time.
@_date: 2019-01-30 11:29:55
You're just proving my point.


Bitcoin is not the only crypto which has a value, so you are arguing against yourself. Whether it's stable or worth very little doesn't matter, bitcoin even worked in 2009 before there were any transaction fees or any exchange selling bitcoins.


You're proving my point again, Ethereum uses blockchain without bitcoin. You don't pay with bitcoin to run contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, you use ether and gas.

We have a similar thing in Sweden (called Swish). The swedish government has a company which creates an electronic identification service you can use either as an app or computer program, and on top of that the banks have created a IT company together which has created an app which works with any bank where you can send money to someones phone number which then points to your prefered bank account. Bank transfers within sweden are always free, so the only thing this app does is esentially linking your phone number to your prefered bank account and makes the transaction instant.


Anonymity can be very important for some, but to me the most important about bitcoin is that it is not regulated and international. The Indian and Swedish services are still based on a controlled currency which is controlled by your government, while Bitcoin is more like gold where the price is directly related to demand. Bitcoin is also works perfectly across borders, and I'm sure that it will take many many years until something similar does.

There is evidence that the CIA and NSA agents that went to jail had full access to the SilkRoad website.
Lyn Ulbricht also says that there is proof that there was more than one DPR, I do not know exactly what proof that is however. There was lots of conspiracy theories long before SilkRoad even went down that this was the case, but that doesn't prove much.

I saw that a couple of days ago and tried to purchase, but it was only possible to buy with bitcoins if the price is in USD, which it apparently isn't anywhere in europe.
Bought it there anyway since it was 10 bucks cheaper than on steam.

"Dump" is a strong word. Uploading a torrent with leaks would be called "dump" but everything uploaded to wikileaks is read through and they don't publish leaks from unreliable sources. Sure we cannot assure that their sources are unreliable because only they have know the source (not always fully and only partially though), but we at least know that they have a policy. Considering their track record i certainly trust them a lot more than most other sites.

But in that case, why BCH specifically?

This sentence


Contradicts your reply


You are literally saying you believe that it happened every single time while there's only evidence which points to that it has has likely happened but not any proof. The most likely scenario is that it has been an inside job multiple times, but the odds of it being so in every case is indeed naïve.

But the only crypto at CoinMarketCap the past 24hrs which has grown more than 25% is BCH at 35% while BTC only at 7.8%.
Anyone have any ideas why the price is going up and why BCH specifically was the target this time?
