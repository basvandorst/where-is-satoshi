I guess any key generator could have weakness built in. This style attack has been an NSA favourite in the past, guess someone somewhere out there may have taken a queue from them.


Yeah I found doing things that way to be relatively painless. For example when splitting off forks and juggling private keys around.
One issue with mobile clients is finding something open source which can be trusted.

Then why are the words covered with scratchy which is then removed before they arrive? Why not just be a dodgy printout?
Guess that's the "authentic" bit which sells the scam? They come not scratched and this is a photo after user scratched them?
To someone who hasn't ordered one before this looks like someone pre-scratching something which came from factory. The warning being about entering seed words which arrived scratched.

No. The second a single one of those coins moved the price would plunge before they could even get them to an OTC desk. Those watching addresses would dump and everyone else would follow in panic.
edit: Lets say someone was offering you the private keys off the market.. What would you pay? 50% of spot? 20% of spot? 10% of spot? 5% of spot? Still too risky to be a bagholder for "Satoshi"? How much would you pay for something you can't liquidate?


The entire point of *"Satoshi Nakamoto"* is that there is no one to be identified. It's a security device.


heh Nice daydream.. No reason for this to ever happen, would destroy trust in the network, while having no net effect on distribution, but whatever.


There is no problem with concentration of wealth in BTC. It's orders of magnitude less than USD and will only continue to redistribute as people sell their hordes.


Kill it overnight.


Destroy all trust in the system overnight.


Like *"Satoshi Nakamoto"* itself the coins are burnt. They can never be recovered. Their purpose is like the rest of the codebase and everything the project was ever about, decentralisation. By burning these coins they ensured no one could gain a lions share advantage from the get-go.
It's obvious. It's by design. You will never see any of these coins move.

If they can make some effort on clearing up this side of the service then they may find some success in future.

This bit here make sense as to why that's a thing? If you get that then a lot of the public/private key stuff must be making sense.
An example, I wanted to claim BTG but could only find the closed source mobile wallet *"Coinomi"*. It's legitimate software one would assume but there is no way of knowing what is happening with a private key behind the scenes.
So I had a BTC address with coins recorded in the blockchain at the block number where the BTG forked. Those coins are associated with that private key from that date on with this forked chain.
Now I wish to just use that private key to move some BTG off it and sell or whatever.
But.. The key is also still associated with that same address on the original BTC chain.
I don't trust the software.
So I must move my BTC from this old address to a new one with a new private key before I enter this old private key into some untrusted software.
p.s. Sorry for rambling all over the thread, but meh you're following my randomness.

Store a private key worth money on a computer connected to the internet?


You can check your wallet balances on a block explorer without having either a node or a hardware wallet. You could also add your public key to software such as Electrum, no risk of keys being exposed, readonly.


While it's true you're trusting a website to tell you the current state of the blockchain, there are many websites with many eyes, if anything is wrong someone will see. 


Yes it's a standard seed used to generate all your keys. All you need is those words, no hardware wallet or node, just words.


Essentially, some wallets may use slightly different seed standards and need to be entered into the same software/hardware type. i.e. Electrum prefixes with an extra number.


If your private key is on the harddrive, if it's stored in plain-text unecrypted, they own your money.


Your seed and a passphrase used to encrypt said seed inside a wallet file on the local harddrive are two separate things.
An encrypted wallet file is encrypted, however did you do everything correctly? Was there a keylogger? Is the passphrase known to the attacker?


If your private keys were known to be stolen there would be a race for you to get access and transfer them to a new address before your adversary does.




If you lose your keys, you lose your funds.

Up 6% last night, over 100% since they started talking publicly about Bitcoin. Not a bad investment in a good crypto early-adopter company who is going to implement Lightning Network.
Square is positioning to be the first to embrace all this so that when Paypal and VISA are suffering Square is growing.

TailsOS will handle it and has recently updated the version of Electrum they package in it.

Someone forked it for ETH I think, but be very, very careful with Electrum forks and ensure you're getting something legitimate. Probably best off just using MyEtherWallet. Never enter Bitcoin keys which have money in them into any other software other than your primary chosen wallet.
If you ever have to enter a private key into some other software or website (bad idea mostly, say to recover a forked coin from that private key or something) then always ensure to move your funds into a new address first so that private key won't also have your Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is P2P and decentralised. No need to go anywhere, we can avoid the state already.


Tor is decentralised, your website would not be. It's whole selling point is about being centralised in Iran where apparently it will be "safe". Where blockchain is about being trustless and not needing these things.
The thing you're attempting to solve isn't a problem with cryptocurrency. Blockchain is the solution to the problem you describe, it cuts governments out entirely.
The issue is where that system interfaces with the old fiat systems.
How can I buy Bitcoins? Oh government has control over that and I need ID unless I'm clever? What can I do about this? Can I buy BTC with USD on an Iranian website? No. No I can not.

Note the bit where the mobile phones are transferring between each other without going back to the central clearing-house. In the future they'll only need the clearing-house part for their fiat private ledger. POS can happen P2P. They can also implement LN and use the clearing-house as a state backup or watch tower, along the way enabling light LN clients which can both send and recieve.
They are on a pathway which sees them move from what is possible today, to what is possible tomorrow. They'll be first at just about everything for the next 5+ years.
Those custodial parts enable them to deal with fiat without the usual risks you'd see of chargebacks which the can't be settled against a blockchain which is immutable. 
Know of any decentralised exchanges dealing in fiat which are able to attract liquidity and have dispute resolution robust enough to make dealing in fiat&lt;-&gt;crypto near risk free? That's a gap which needs to be bridged for a company like Square to start processing payments today. How they handle those same payments in future is another thing.
Make no mistake, apart from Bitcoin itself Square is the biggest disruption happening in POS. They're also the biggest thing happening in Bitcoin.

Possibly, it would do this by querying a node and asking it to do the harder parts of that indexing. I imagine.
In the case of Electrum you're relying on 3rd party remote nodes to run it as a "light" wallet. No downloading of the blockchain and validating all the transactions since the beginning.


That's where the hot wallet and block explorer come in.
They see the current state, where the cold wallet is blind and can only sign transactions.
Transactions which were crafted from current state in the hot wallet.
(This is the annoying back and forth which is largely eliminated with hardware wallet which transports the unsigned transaction with a button press)

Yeah I think I've been misspeaking slightly when saying that it's derived from seed, probably more derived from `input` I'm not certain on protocol level.


This is where my misspeaking comes in, they'd be deriving along the way it's just if you have that seed phrase as the heart of those keys it makes offline backup simple.


Now we're definitely talking protocol level.


I imagine somewhere in here is an algo for going from an address, to a public key, to a path to regenerate the matching private key.

First bit is nothing ever exists in the software, only access (keys). It's all inside the blockchain.


That's the misconception part which I'm really not sure how to explain or if I know it well enough to.


Best way to see this is probably in Electrum with testnet for yourself.
`./electrum --testnet`
Under the "Views" menu there is options for tabs which may be hidden by default, including "Addresses" which shows a long batch of pre-generated addresses (some labelled "receiving" some "change") and "Coins" which shows the actual "coins" beside the "addresses" they were sent to.
They're more the `outputs` of a transaction than any address I guess. They're the things which are aggregated into new `inputs` to spend.

@_date: 2018-05-27 00:19:35


It's the protocol itself.
Random recent transaction off recent block.
* So it has 1 input which had `0.01672014` in it.
* Sends `0.01544113` to one address.
* Sends `0.00127675` to another.
One of those addresses is a "change" address which was generated from the same seed phrase the original sender used to generate `16g9PZiSs2RULqQL7g8M7BmV8EWMv62wGC`.
In this way the *ledger* is always moving forward with inputs becoming outputs becoming inputs. Always accounted for into a new address rather than left remaining in an address after having some taken from it.
So with a paper wallet (a single private key matching a single address, not generated from a seed phrase) if you spend $1 out of $1000, the $999 goes to an address you don't have a key for.

It clears it out entirely. All funds move. The ledger goes forward, never stationary, never a remainder left with X taken from it but always everything moving and ending up as new records on the ledger.
Just like accounting software. There is no delete or edit, only add, only forward. You can't minus $1 from $1000 you can only send $999 to a new place and $1 to another place.


You can keep receiving funds on any address you control indefinitely, you will always have a key for it, if you have a key for it. You can send "from that address"**  and it will be cleaned out, the change will go elsewhere. Though that doesn't stop you from receiving again on the same address and sending out "from" it again.
** (note the wiki explaining how *coins* aren't addresses as such and that *"from wallet address"* is a misconception)
The address (cryptographic keys) never become invalidated.
Like you see on that block explorer example, there is `0` left in the `input` address once that transaction takes place. The "change" has been sent to a new address.
* Paper wallet single private key = no control over this new address.  
* Seed phrase = the change address was generated from seed, you can access it

Best practice is for your wallet software to change addresses each time you go to the "receive" tab and generate a "wallet" for someone to send funds to.
This part is one of the confusing things in how everything is named. "Wallet", "address", "account", people easily get it all mixed up.


If you have a seed phrase rather than a single private key then you can generate all the other associated addresses. That single seed phrase is the key to deriving the keys.


Each private/public key remains valid. You can receive funds to an address again and access those funds.
Though new addresses with new private keys won't be backed up unless you have that seed phrase which was used to generate them all in the first place. If you backed up a single private key for a single public key matching a single address, then that's all you have. Access to a single address.

A "webwallet". So it's javascript on a HTML page. Doesn't matter where in the world it is, it's code you can run anywhere, it communicates with no centralised servers. There is nothing to be shutdown already.
There is no need for KYC or AML, it's only software.
On the other hand, using your webwallet would introduce a bunch of risks for myself. How can I trust you? Why would I? I already don't need to today.

Don't use paper wallets. Seed words sure, but not printed out single private keys to single addresses without change addresses being accessible. Good way to lose everything to a simple mistake.


Not in the way they tell you to generate them.








If you don't send the entire amount the change goes to an address you do not control and is lost forever.


Cold Storage.
TailsOS is an easy approach.
Uou boot up from USB into your presistent encrypted TailsOS. You enter your seed and encryption passphrase for the wallet file into Electrum and never connect this OS to the internet.
Now setup Electrum on your desktop OS, but only enter a read-only PUBLIC key.
You can now view balances and create transactions on the internet connected machine. To sign transactions you must transport the unsigned transaction file to the offline Cold Storage OS and sign it offline, before returning to the internet connected OS and broadcasting this now signed transaction.
Works the same as a Trezor basically.

A lot of *"Lets simply add more hardware"* scaling *"solutions"* where you work?
The issue remains that *"add more blocksize"* in the sense of blockchain is at the expense of centralisation. Decentralisation is the primary value proposition here and anything which harms that is not progress. Solving the issue in decentralised ways is the priority rather than adding temporary imaginary capacity at the expense of the most important aspects of the project.
@_date: 2018-06-23 00:18:54




Any blockchain started today has to play catch up. It would take quite some time to become established, generate a chain long enough to not be overwritten, gain large amount of hashpower and distribute that hashpower. 
The result is that newer blockchains instead distinguish themselves in other ways to attract users. Such as lower fees or faster transaction times. 
At the expense of centralisation.
All alternative blockchains make a decision to sacrifice decentralisation to give themselves an advantage and provide value to users.
At it's simplest, there is no fork being created with smaller blocks. While if there were, it would be a long way behind from genesis block onwards.
It's very difficult to compete directly with Bitcoin blockchain on decentralisation (if you take longest-accumulated-PoW as being important then pretty much "impossible"). You can compete on many other fronts but Bitcoin has a lot of first mover advantage when it comes to the size of the network.

If the phrase has been generated privately and not shared with any 3rd party service, then exactly as secure. It's just words on a piece of paper.
The hardware device adds security at the time of signing, keeping the private keys offline and airgapped from the internet. A transaction is passed over, signed and passed back to your internet connected device.
You can have a similar open-source setup with TailsOS on a bootable USB key and Electrum as a Cold Wallet. A little extra hassle passing the unsigned transaction back and forth compared to button press on a hardware wallet.

Nothing is ruined by having merchant service enablers growing adoption and making the technology ubiquitous (and decentralised) in time.

That's not dumb.


Square is not Coinbase and does not behave the same way in trying to hamstring the future, instead they embrace it as this is their future strength.


It's not. Not sure anything that has been said in this moronic thread ever supported anything of the sort.


How so? They are big proponents of LN and P2P payments, having no intention of capturing it as a custodial hamstrung broken protocol but instead wanting to see themselves grow with it. Getting in the way of their own future success doesn't make any sense as a premise for your apparent argument.

Seems we're talking about different things, end users buying custodial BTC vs a business which has access to peoples mobile phones and merchants with POS terminals.
Square is working their advantage in the POS market. Sure each individual merchant could they themselves put in the effort to discover how they might use these systems, but that doesn't mean Square putting such tools in their hands is a necessarily a bad thing.
Don't worry I feel where you're coming from with absolutism on the importance of decentralisation, though honestly Square's approach to these things is about as good as one could imagine. 
They're on the same team and want a future in which it's all P2P, because then they beat VISA, Paypal and all comers. If decentralisation is truly the future then Square is going to out value Amazon given time.

Only that peer is always the same person, who has a written policy stating they may ask you for **Two Forms of National Photo ID** before finding against you.

Telling people *"Run your own system, that's the point!"* doesn't drive anything let alone any adoption or engagement.
When Square pivots to P2P LN transactions you'll probably still claim it's custodian due to irrational hatred you've developed.

It's funny that you still think you need to prove something to me, when really you're misunderstanding the entire point of this *"conversation"*. We're talking at cross purposes because you keep thinking this is about custodial services vs P2P, when in fact it's about usability and merchant service availability. 
Square driving this adoption is a good thing for Bitcoin because it's a good thing for merchants and for customers. No matter how much you'd wish they all done they own independent research and implemented open source products, the fact remains that this brings BTC to MANY merchants.

Thing with this though is there is nothing they can capture other than hashpower, at which stage they're playing the same game as everyone else.

Not an issue with this market as decentralisation is the primary unique selling point.
You're free to use another blockchain for extra capacity, that won't mean the chain with the longest accumulated PoW simply vanishes or that it fails to retain it's market position in the longer term.
You can very quickly throw away this advantage with blocksize increases. That is not incremental improvement.


Sure. First we had Segwit, then LN, then Channel Factories, now we have Eltoo. A lot of progress is happening all the time. Meanwhile not a whole lot has needed to change on the Bitcoin *protocol* itself.

*"only right 40% of the time"* ignores risk/reward. Although it makes a good hook for a headline, anyone imagining they have a higher than normal win-rate is a straight up gambler.
They can survive and even thrive with a 40% win-rate thanks to managed position sizing and diversification. You can't do that by betting all in on red.

It states a process where ID is simply demanded as step 1 of "Phase 2". Then somehow after arbitrator looks at their photo one of them is found to be defrauding the other.
What happens with their documents during this process is not disclosed and no policy seems to exist on how these records must be stored.

You have to understand the style of propaganda which has been used in this whole thing.
A lot of concern trolling, guerrilla marketing, sealioning, sock-puppetry and many many articles which profess to be one thing but are actually another.
Half of might appear to be *"anti-bcash memes"*. Look closer and they're things which *"teach the controversy"*, in many cases they're actually selling BCH ideas but in a way which those vehemently opposed will engage with an upvote. It's a way to get past the removal of overt spam. Nothing is what it seems.
I see where you've tried to go with this but you have to understand that this style of re-telling of the narratives has long been a staple way to keeping something nearly irrelevant front and centre for months past it's used-by-date.
If you were writing articles on WMD in Iraq pre-gulf war, would it be simply an impartial look at the known facts? Would you end up in the same situation as the NewYorkTimes having just sold a whole country on a lie?
You're right in that BCH as a hard-fork has the same properties as BTC and will still remain in future. Besides the heavy centralisation it will become similarly anti-fragile and will out-live both Roger and Jihan.

There is no reason for them to store anything. You have your seed words and they should never leave your computer.


Pointless, it was plain-text in the client memory, now it's encrypted in the client memory. What was gained? It was still in the clear and will need to be in the clear again before you use it. This would only be needed if you were transmitting it in the clear and had no TLS connection. 


A normal password reset on a web service can be done by confirming ownership of an email address (plus 2FA) and then hashing a new password and storing that new hash. This can be done without ever needing a plain-text version.
There is no need for a wallet to have any kind of password for any kind of service. There is no service needed, just code.

Not statistically significant. Though you may be able to spot movements quickly given the lack of liquidity. Often the less liquid market can be used as a more sensitive gauge on the underlying market, but this is not in any way reliable.
This same thing can be true for even shitcoins or things *almost* completely unrelated to BTC/USD but able to be moved with less effort.
These types of variations are probably often very small and although a small relex movement on the futures may herald a move on the underlying, the risk/reward is so small that if you were to bet on them you'd be churned out. It looks no different to noise most of the time.

Not really, that was only an issue on the 12th of November when the armies of concern trolls showed up to shill people into selling BTC for BCH at the top. It's only the perception of the choir and the choir knows the songs. Also, it's now been priced in and we see the price correction to match the network.


Good coders do scaling properly so that does not happen. Adding more hardware is what happens when things have already failed and will continue to fail.
Do you want your money to behave like a failing website or feature robust architecture?


Good thing it won't be an issue next time around when we have off-chain channel factories on LN and the like. Nice the price corrected to take this into account.


For some of the choir. No one else is in any way concerned.

I manage my counter-party risk still of course.


I have no photo ID and so far as I'm aware are tagged in no facial recognition databases, this will be like a super-power or a curse within a few years but it's something I value. Even Bisq is demanding 2 forms of National Photo ID for dispute resolution (whatever photos prove in that use-case).
If an exchange switches policy overnight on withdrawal limits and I'm forced to KYC for funds access, I'll essentially be forced to enter my complete updated profile into state databases. The Stassi could have only dreamed. I'd rather let the funds go for that counter-party.


Absolutely irrelevant. In a trustless decentralised system my identify and location are entirely meaningless and should have no impact on the network or any disputes within it. There should be no demands on me providing anything of the sort in the way of personal data.

This is a interim layer-2 solution for merchants to adopt with low barrier to entry.

Not necessary. If you are a programmer.

If Square can provide **a** UX for users **today**, then good for them. It's better than saying *"oh you can run your own wallet, just do that, there's your merchant site done, just ask people to email you their orders or something, easy!!!"*


In time. That is another different phase of this evolution of adoption. One day BTC may even be used a *currency* in common usage, this will be another phase again.


They will. Just because you don't like how the world works won't change this being the way these ideas evolve and gain yet more traction. Square isn't going to, or even attempting to "capture" Bitcoin for themselves as some kind of monopoly, thinking that is just delusional.

If you start reading API docs and the like you quickly see they actively set things up so that developers can't bring their products into performance disrepute. 
APIs which would allow you to drain batteries by bypassing features which save such are restricted while AppStore addition is conditional on not degrading phone performance.
They try to avoid *"Apple phones are shit the battery only lasts 2 minutes!!"* because of something a 3rd party developer does, like the next viral game deciding to be lazy coders or a little aggressive with resource use while not being actively played.
Heavy competition with Android for battery performance and policing their AppStores is a big part of this battleground.

Your money is on Coinbase's site.
You want it for yourself in your own hands. (or you figure you can't be trusted with your own money and instead trust them ;D)
One of these hardware wallets might suit, makes it fairly easy.
I like Electrum software a wallet.
They generate words, these words are your password. No matter what happens if you have these words you have your money.
But first...
Your money is on Coinbase's site and not in this wallet, so you'll need to transfer it. Coinbase will have a page for this, where you enter a number the hardware/software gives you as an "address" to send the Bitcoins to.

You'd purchase, but then it would be best to transfer out of whatever exchange website and to an actual Bitcoin wallet. 
Software or hardware wallet generates a set of words you write down and store securely. These are used to generate all the rest of your keys. This Mnemonic phrase becomes your "cold storage", "paper wallet".
  
  
Once transferred to another wallet if anything happens to Coinbase, you're in full control of your own Bitcoins.

We just broke above a 12 month old established channel on the logarithmic chart. 
Before this happened many were looking for a dip to add positions (wanting a dip and getting one can be mutually exclusive if everyone wants the same thing). 7700, 7200, 6700, 6200 and spots between were all mentioned as potential targets for a step backwards before the push for 10k.
Now the channel has broken no one knows what anything is. 
Personally I took the bet that top of channel around 8800 has turned from resistance to support. That anything approaching 8k will be seen as cheap, especially with so much attention from the recent milestones and strong fundamentals. While anything below 8k will be snapped up.

Was. Then discovered it's pointless and ill-suited "demonstration".
Any tipper bot which allows a user to leave a tip for another to retrieve at some later day will involve an escrow holding this balance until the recipient arrives.
Thus defeating the purpose of demonstrating LN with a tipper bot. None of the trustlessness can be taken advantage of without a much different flow.
* So you'd need to announce your intention to tip someone,
* then if the bot already has their hash they can construct an address for the tipper.
* If however the user has never before received a tip they will need to be notified, 
* then come back and submit their information,
* which is then brokered by the bot and delivered to the tipper,
* who then has to deliver the tip to this address.
This should highlight how the BCH tipper bot is smoke and mirrors, demonstrating no scaling but instead being a 3rd party escrow in a private SQL database.

It doesn't work quite the same way. 
~~You don't just throw an address out there passively and have people send to it.~~ (well you kinda do, but point is that you need the address first and they're a little more complex then Bitcoin addresses)  The tip bot would need to escrow funds in an "off-chain" account so it had the ability to deliver the funds at a later date when the recipient finally comes to pickup.
Kinda defeating the purpose and not really demonstrating the power of the system. It would instead be the same old *"You have to trust a 3rd party to keep your balance in their SQL database"*
If you designed the system around LN it would be trustless and quite good. However the user-experience wouldn't really marry up with what a tip-bot is and you'd have parties posting tips, only to then have to come back and complete the process 6 months later when the counter-party wants to claim.

Problem is you take LN, a trustless system. Then push it into a tip-bot, a centralised banking system where a balance is kept in a database for the recipient.
Just like the BCH tip-bot doesn't demonstrate scaling but is smoke and mirrors, so this would also not demonstrate scaling but be the same centralised bank of tips waiting to be picked up.
Doing so accomplishes none of the *"See this is how it's done properly"* as it would be exactly the same as the BCH bot.
You submit your desire to tip someone, then later they come along and provide a LN address for you to do so  (system generates an appropriate address to match tippers desires).
Now this starts to look very different to your standard tip-bot UX flow.
Is the tipper still interested in investing their effort in this tip after time has passed? Tips are kinda a drive-by impulse thing.
Another option might be a SmartContract to hold the escrow, taking the place of the SQL database and centralised backend. Meaning the recipient can come pickup from the contract at any time in future. Also not demonstrating LN scaling.
@_date: 2018-03-14 22:25:37


They are correct.
My understanding is it will be internal database transfer, instant with no fees.
This is effectively a batching and layering approach, they can scale at will and settle in BTC.

If there is no LCD screen receipt (displayed on your end or theirs), you look at your paper receipt (something which isn't needed as you saw it on your wallet screen and the vendors POS terminal).
When you discover the discrepancy, you reverse it with the vendor. Like any other transaction medium. 
Just no *"refund"* process besides *"send back the same amount of money"*.
You don't cancel an existing transaction, it's an accounting ledger, you make a new transaction to reconcile the difference.

Doubtful. It won't be a BTC transaction at POS. There shouldn't be any extra fees as it's no different to any other currency in their system, only the way it is "withdrawn" changes from wire-transfer to Bitcoin transaction.
It will be instant and no different to any other transaction through Square. No blockchain cost/record will be generated until the user (merchant or customer) deposits or withdraws.

No really. Try to make one and you'll quickly see it's ill suited to the task and just makes the process convoluted while delivering none of the trustless benefits of LN.
There are things LN is good at, tip-bots are not one of them.
Any good tip-bot ~~will hold funds in a balance for~~ allow the user to collect months and years into the future. 
For this the only unique identifier they have is the persons reddit username or an LN address they have already registered with the system and associated with their username. If the person has not previously interacted with the system then the prudent thing to do would be to take funds from the tipper and hold them until the person registers with the system (defeating the purpose and not demonstrating LN).
It could be done P2P without any 3rd party escrow, however the flow doesn't really work the same as a standard tip-bot where nothing is needed to be known about the recipient. Here you need their address and LN addresses aren't like BTC ones.

Someone in there somewhere decided AngularJS was the perfect tool for a website with hundreds of constantly updating elements being spammed at the browser.

So scaling then? ;)
This is the thing in the block-size "debate" which is so easily missed by the human brain when a person first hears the talking-points. When programmers talk about scaling, it's about scaling to infinity in increasingly less time as it goes. 
Exponents do as exponents are. Humans suck at them.
One good demonstration; You've got two magnets in your hands, you bring them together and are able to keep the pace steady and linear. Then at some point they rush ahead of your ability to calculate the force required to keep them apart.
Another anecdote; Just about every milestone which was ever set for The Human Genome Project was exceeded. This is how the math goes.

It seems the evidence is of a quality high enough to convince those which do not understand the evidence. So far the "evidence" available publicly is enough to convince such bureaucracies. It's good enough to raise indictments, but from our understanding of events *can not possibly* attribute any level of certainty. Maybe there will be a lack of *reasonable doubt*, but that won't make any finding match with reality.
There is simply no way to physically connect these dots. All connections which have been made in reports like this are based on motive and opportunity. *"Russia wants to.."* rather than *"We observed.."*
The only way is if NSA can reliably deanonymise Tor. Something they would never admit.

This is what *"Ethereum magicians"* are attempting to change in the way EIPs are discussed (centralising them into their magicians forum site). They hope to push consensus to the end of the process. That technical discussions should only be about what is technically possible, that these things can be implemented and then the community can decide if they want to run the new clients or not. Something they don't really get a choice in, they'll be running whatever client they're given.

That is a nice anecdote, many people have the same story to tell.
Issue remains that their published policy for "Phase 2" of that process is to demand **Two Forms of National Photo ID**.
If you have no photo ID and are not registered in state photo databases, then you can not complete a phase 2 dispute resolution and will lose your funds if confronted with this policy. It's right there in black and white. This is the published policy, not some random fantasy.
Until that policy changes, it is the policy. Until it changes there is the risk of losing everything if you don't provide identification documentation. This is unacceptable to myself and others like me. You may feel differently about this risk profile, that's your choice.

Although things all look much the same and everything really boils down the same, Reddit can be a bit different to say Facebook or Twitter. 
These other services have algos which control what you see and create circlejerks of GroupThink where people are only ever shows things they agree with. Then they further police themselves, if I were to show up in a group and tell you something you didn't want to hear I'd be banned. Where here moderators here would be hung for banning people over such petty interpersonal reasons. Being challenged is part of using this site.
Reddit on the other hand there is a slightly different dynamic where the community culture prides itself on not being taken in by the same bullshit which works elsewhere (although they do get taken in all the same, only human).

Which rates? Ones provided by a central Oracle service outside of the blockchain?


This should answer your question. BTC is not suited to the task of currency while in it's speculative phase. You end up buying a pizza for $100,000. Instead you're wishing for a "currency", something stable. Which isn't BTC, but something else.


Unless it wipes out currencies and becomes so ubiquidous that 1BTC = 1BTC and value not being pinned to some other asset becomes irrelevant.
Otherwise perhaps another *currency* can be pegged to BTC and this will be the daily use *currency*.
None of the Bitcoin forks use this type of distribution curve. They're not trying to duplicate central banks.


Sure you can. Depends on your time-frame. If you're aiming at 15m candles then sure, you'll be churned up.


Any. Thanks to the supply curve you'll be up eventually, unless the whole thing dies (hence the speculation in both directions).
p.s. I believe there is a talk from Andreas Antonopoulos on this question of creating currencies with different supply curves.

Yeah it was low hanging fruit and obvious choice to get out first. Hope we aren't left with a legacy of everything being built on the tools which were embraced at the "start".
Modern tooling on boilerplates is good to see, shows potential for a foundation where people start with good workflows. Thinking of this one for Ethereum/Web3JS which seems to be used for a lot of games:


It's crazy that I can't and that we don't really have anything trusted and reliable today right?
I really wish I had something. I've tried taking a lot of the generation of pages and stuff offline if possible, things like `jekyll` or `numjunks` ran on templates from `gulp`.
For more traditional billing/carts *Stripe* was a revelation though for someone like myself who can whip up custom backend hooks. Their APIs made things much easier to deal with and played nice with all the right tooling options.
Having these Javascript/NodeJS interfaces for API micro-payments and the like is looking good.

Yes. You can write a new blockchain with whatever supply system your economists can come up with. You can even do a *central bank authority coin* if you so desire. Will anyone care?


You are mistaken.


When those who use this new system are doing better than those who are stuck with wheelbarrows full of USD, you'll very quickly see this type of "adoption". Until then, speculation is "adoption".

It's a tiny fraction. Operating costs. An insignificant sum in the grand scheme of things. Sure it might seem significant to an individual but this isn't the pot of gold which is being grown, it's just a drop in the ocean.
Lets flip that, so I'm saying there is more? Why would someone with tens of thousands of BTC want BTC "look bad"? 
* Take a look at the chart for November 12th.
For reference, it's BCH "flippening" FUD (armies of shills showing up everywhere to spam *"You're on a sinking ship, I really hope you don't lose your life savings"*) combined with hashpower attack from miners and transaction spam grinding the network to a halt (the same tactic we're discussing here).
Can you imagine how many BTC were acquired in that play? A hell of a lot more than 58. 
Why would you want to make BTC look bad when you can make $100m or more in a single play..
Anyone with hundreds of millions of dollars worth of BTC and BCH has a vested interest in acquiring more hundreds of millions of dollars worth of BTC (and resources to do so). Even if that means a short term *"look bad"*, that *"bad"* only improves their bottom line.
This isn't using 58BTC to make 58BTC worth less. It's using 58BTC to make 10,000 - 100,000BTC worth less and *then* more.

Surely they teach economists something about biases.

This is not how it works. This is giving a platform to fraud. It is implicit promotion of a scam. These things are designed to circumvent the human brains defence mechanisms.
Disprove god. Go on. It's a scam right? So you should be able to simply apply some logic and instantly no one will fall for it again.

That's what they were banking on.
They've failed. They were always going to fail as decentralisation is the true value here. Anything which is more centralised has less value. They were in their own head enough and surrounded by enough fanbois that they started believing their own hype.

The workers had a good idea. Use the transmission infrastructure and pivot to solar power generation.
From my understanding the plant is toast, costs too much maintenance to have it not killing workers. Any downtime would have killed it and the costs would be prohibitive, no matter what Fairfax shill story is running for whoever wants to run the math on restarting.

You're falling for the guerrilla marketing again. Stop upvoting this shit.

Opposite. Distribution happens again and again. Concentration of BTC is much lower than USD.

I think you understand probability ;D
Too rare around these parts!

Those steps are all only required once.
Eventually it will be part of your on-ramp (another different site then this one), where you'll join and be grouped as part of a Channel Factory for a 99% fee reduction. Should be seemless part of buying BTC, you just get a channel as well without having to think about it.

A complete and total misrepresentation. A bad talking-point argument which was old and failed by March 2010.
You can surely find better more up-to-date pieces of bunk to marry yourself to.

You can't unfuck.
It's a spam lottery, who cares. What you're saying is there was no revenue in BCH because no one cares about BCH apart from sockpuppets and fools.

Tipping is poorly suited to LN.
Involves either custodial wallet or a middleman organising an invoice to be exchanged.
This is how you really do LN tipping P2P.
*"Hey I'd like to tip you 25msats, throw us an invoice"*
*"Awesome man, here you go!"*
No third party services needed.
