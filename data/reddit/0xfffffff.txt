According to the chart it has been under 10 mins. since about 2014. That's exactly how long it is supposed to take.

You are wrong.

.bit is the true crypto top level domain.
@_date: 2014-08-03 23:45:26
Bitcoin websites should use .bit anyhow.
That's the true crypto top level

Predictions are really difficult, especially ones involving the future.

If the difficulty ever drops to 1 and below, I will run a miner regardless of rewards.

None of us will be able to aquire all bitcoins, as they won't be all mined during our lifetime. (And of course the lost keys issue comes into play as well. )

How about proof of existence. Take your research report hash it and put it on the blockchain. That way in the future when you can divulge it you can prove that in fact it did exist as of today. You should know PoE since you are interested in bitcoin.
Alos it should be relatively easy to find the research paper mentioned about FPGAs, if it was published.

Can a bitcoin not be traced all the way back to its Coinbase transaction?
@_date: 2015-10-27 22:22:36
Look at the leaders in the field BitFury and KnCMiner, also look who is solving lots of blocks and look up their business model.
This is of course a big-money game now. You would need tens of millions of dollars to compete.

What about bitcoins that have been burned? Are those still fungible?

Someone still keeps track of the off-blockchain transactions.
Coinbase (or bitpay) does exactly that, if I'm a Coinbase user and I send payment to a Coinbase merchant it is instantaneous (send and confirm) and off-blockchain.
