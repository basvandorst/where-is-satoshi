Bitcoin values comes from the costs to produce it. Mining. It is also backed by FIAT. Every fiat exchanged to buy Bitcoin. Fiat use to pay for mining costs. Land and labour. The very basic of economic factors gives value to BTC.
The real question is, what is FIAT backed by? Drugs? Corruptions? Taxation? Speculations? IoUs? Or all of the above and definitely not by Gold!

I bought two new Casio. Casio Edifice Red Bull Limited Edition and a Casio Mudmaster watch. As well as a new DJI drone.

Usually, in Japan, if we choose to pay by Crypto, we get it for cheaper apart for Bills. But if you go to Den Den town, they will give better deal if paying by crypto.
Japanese love Bitcoin, Ethereum and their own version of Bitcoin called Monacoin.

China never ban Bitcoin. When did they? 
All those news couple of years ago are paid FUDS. China has supoorted BTC. Look at the minning. You think if its illegal they won't just close Bitmain? 
They will shut down minning only when they steal power for their equipments. Apart that Minning companies contributes plenty for China.
FUDs are all paid negative / fake news. 
Bitcoin didnt have FUD or any positive news when it was still 0.001cents in 2008. Don't be fooled.

It doesn't matter. 1 BTC = 1 BTC. Once you can see the bigger picture and where we are heading, you'll see that Fiat has no value.
Fiat may co exist with Bitcoin in the future, but no longer the standard.
I'm in Japan, here and in S.Korea people are using crypto for many things. Buying electronic goods, pay utility bills, shopping at Department store, private transaction with small - medium size merchants. 
We are early. Regardless what you read, hear or see, we are still very early. Once Bitcoin hits its max value. It will be a stable coin. 
This will take time and in fiat value Bitcoin will be valuable, priceless and sought after. Those who don't have won't survive.
This is just my experience and as an early adopter and miner way before it became huge, it is the reason why we believe and we don't care what people or media say. 
In 2010 we didn't have any news, FUD, Crypto Twitter and see where we are now.
Good luck!

Japan has never denied crypto. I just want to put that forward. In fact Japan is the first nation to fully adopt and embrace crypto. When you come to Japan, you'll be able to spend BTC, ETH, Mona and others. Mostly BTC and ETH at over 50,000 merchants.

Little known fact. Most Bitcoins are in Japan, S. Korea and China. So 'Try' and bar and ban all they want. The rest of the world will continue adopting crypto. Europe, Australasia, Africa South East Asia. So a ban will mean an uptrend in Crypto prices.
I say let them ban. US can always get their BTC from abroad. So simple. This is what Bitcoin is for. By the people for the people backed by the people.

Most merchants that accepts BTC will accept from any wallet but it won't be as fast as from Bitflyer's wallet.

@_date: 2018-08-14 19:55:30
Yes. Here in Japan. As a merchant it is zero fees. As an investor and user it is very practical. Personally, I have purchased coffees and electronics goods and pay my utility bills. When I travel, specially to S.Korea I don't need to carry so much cash. Credit card is a backup for me and only use it where crypto aren't accepted yet. Popular Cryptos being use here in Japan are BTC, ETH, Monacoin and NEM. Near identical case in S.korea. 
It benefits both parties, merchants and coiners. There are more and more merchants adopting crypto due to zero fees compared to Credit card. Sadly this is rarely mentioned in the media outside of Japan.
Even in a bear market right now, it's no different for anyone. Whether value increase or decrease merchants will gladly accept it and people are using it. In a bear market it is more attractive for people to use it since it is cheaper to purchase the coins. And merchants will store it until they need to converted to Fiat if they actually do need to convert it at all.

Don't look at it as a way to make more money and enrich yourself with fiat, but look at it from how rare it is and survival. BTC will buy you more than Lambo.
It is ready when it's ready. And it will soon. There are 21,000,000 reason for you to start now. And having more fiat is not one of the reason.

Most exchanges provides OTC. The question is how many thousands of BTC are you planning to purchase?
@_date: 2019-10-02 06:14:57
Ok. Here's the best advice I can give you. Leave everything you know about Micro and Macroeconomics. Forget all school of thoughts, disregard anything and everything you read, flip the bird at every TA opinions and chart. 
Either you buy and HODL because once it's ready, you are set and have acquired your freedom from gov control paper that they called money.  Alternatively, you buy and gamble. Easy right?
HODLing is harder than trading! All early adopters are HODLers. That was phase 1. We are now phase 2. Where majority of early adopters are still HODLing
There are no economics here. Bitcoin is a whole new monetary system. Be part of it, or feel free to trade it.

Not surprise. CNBC can't even spell BTC or pronounce it.
@_date: 2019-02-11 07:03:32
It will eventually equal the total supply of BTC. As more using it and since supply can't be more than 21,000,000 it will be 1 BTC = 21,000,000 BTC.
Hard to see now. For example a car or a house my just cost 1 BTC. 
Bottled water = 0.0001 satoshi
The market will dictate and adjust accordingly. But this is how it'll be done. Phasing out Fiat will be a long process. So people can trade, people can invest, most Hodl. Those trading will eventually re-invest back their Fiat profit into Crypto.

Follow the whales, the rest are just loud nonsense!
 Go attend blockchain / crypto conferences only if  the developers and investors are present. The rest are just scam.
Most important, ignore any and all mainstream media. They are all paid shills ( influencers ). They are the parasite and cancer in Cryptocurrencies. 
Graphs and TA are only correct after it happened or they are just lucky. Whales, do not need or use TA!
Ignore any mine renting or free BTC. Common sense! If you fall for it, you don't deserve to be in Crypto.
Buy a Hardwallet! This is a Must. Not your key not your coins.
Good luck to all BTC enthusiasts and Beginners! This are the only advice I can give you.

Personally, I never do, never will. Plus I never read the media, any media covering Crypto. 
Been in this space for many years. All I can say is I'm doing well and whatever the market situation is I don't care. When I need to sell I sell, when I need to buy I just buy.
Listening to other people, who has no knowledge and any kind of investment portfolios is like handing over your assets to strangers.
Notice how they aren't wealthy. None of them are. All morons and bunch of wannabe dreamers.
Do what you think is right. For me what is always the right move no matter what other think is to keep buying. 90% I'm buying. 10% I sell and only when I need to. 0% trading! 100% Hardwallet.
I'm set for life.
@_date: 2019-04-02 07:26:00
Yes, gamblers and dreamers. This is not instant. Will only reward those who fully understand.
Do you know any rich traders? Either they have huge amount of people's capital to trade or they are simply broke.
You talking about predicting. Do you know any fortune teller that are rich? Without any sort of scam and deception? 
But hey it's your funds and trusting strangers opinions with it....he he he.
Early adopters had no price prediction, no TA, no media messing with people's view. No bears, no bulls. All bought because they believed and have vision of what BTC is about.
@_date: 2019-04-02 07:01:39
Ok. You have your opinion, I have mine.
Personally, I don't follow the masses. But that's just me. 
When your doctor say you will die next week will you kill yourself? Do you believe the doctor? Science has facts and yet most are speculation and most of the time wrong.
Crypto TA has no fact nor any support in any TA. Just opinions by gamblers, trolls and dreamers.
Although, with BTC it has a vision. When it's ready, it will reward those who believed and support it.

If that happens all the early adopters will dump all. Price will go back to under a dollar and they won't return. Leaving all those buying under a dollar hodling heavy bags forever. Price will not return to even 10 dollars, miners will leave. Nothing left.
That is what Fiat loving Faketoshi wants. He doesn't care about Crypto. He had his fill and as a selfish last act he wants to destroy it. Just for the fun of it and at the expense of many newbies dreaming of lambo.
Lambo will happen and do happen. But not when theres so many FUD.

What we see here are BTC &amp; ETH. Noncoiners will believe anything they are fed by fake news and paid media.
Just look at Bcash camp. All the greed, instead they are supporting the lifestyle of a phsyco faketoshi and co. And again now they are hoping the new BSV ( fork of BCH ) Bitshitvision coin will make them rich. 
Faketoshi is a cancer, a fraud, and he doesn't care about crypto. He loves Fiat. Those who support this crazy maniac deserves to lose everything!
The point is yes tulip mania although a couple survived. Same as dot com bubble. Couple survived. We had netscape, iRC, so many others I can't even remember. 
Only the original and usually a healthy competitor with different system but in the same industry will survive. These are BTC &amp; ETH. Look at it as iOS and Windows. Or iOS &amp; Androids.
Innovation and not copy and paste ( hardforking ) wins!
FYI, faketoshi is going to kill BCH. Check his crazy tweet. Afterall the hype, the talk he will kill it. This is simply because he needs more money ( Fiat )
@_date: 2018-11-02 14:24:54

1. Anytime, everytime is a good time to buy BTC. 1BTC=1BTC. Only fiat lovers care about price. So much value placed on paper that are owned by central banks. ( Read every paper money, you should be able to see that the paper is lended to you only as a legal tender ).
2. Exchanges, ATMs or OTC ( trusted friends only )
3. Hardwallet.

If you stop reading all the fake news, drown out all the noises you will know there are 50,000 merchants alone in Japan that accepts BTC and ETH. S.Korea, Australia, UK, US, Switzerland, Singapore basically worldwide.
If you care about price then simply you love Fiat. If you accepts BTC as our World Currency then you have lost absolutely nothing and you are part of history. That is more valuabe than any paper money.

Your uncle is right.
Although would you buy it at the time without knowing the future value? Some of us were lucky enough to have mined it early. It was for fun, something new. Then government and banks waged war and we all fought back. Hence the price increase. 
We are still very early right now. Just avoid any fake news, paid media and day traders. Keep buying and hodl!

The cancers of Crypto. These two do not care about Blockchain or Crypto. They are in this for more Fiat money.
Clearly faketoshi attitude shows a typical new rich. Finding it hard to fit with the original 1%. Same as his Bcash coins. It is not Bitcoin.
Scammers would always find a way to make money. Hard fork is a sign project is failing, no adoption or someone is losing serious money.
Using scare tactics by renting and paying off for hash means nothing for long term. The hypocrisy is strong in Bcash.
I have absolute zero pitty for anyone losing money there. And yet they are being fooled again by the same twat that fooled them last year. BTC &amp; ETH will complement each other. Healthy competition for a brighter future for everyone.
None of this Bcash nonsense. Logically, if you see a team that are sucking your wealth and failed why would you follow again? Greed will be the downfall of Bcash.
Other Crypto Hodlers will be rewarded once this hash dick measuring contest is over. 
It is down now, here is a chance to buy. Crypto are down due to miner, not because BTC and Crypto are dying.
But you are free to believe otherwise.

Well you think what's best for you. My personal opinion Crypto and Blockchain are the future. Cut out the middleman, full control of your own assets, reduction in wealth gap, no inflation due to over printing paper money. Blockchain is being adopted without many people realize. 
Look at EEA ( Ethereum Enterprise Alliance ) See the 500+ members, see if you recognize any names in there. Those are the 500+ companies the products you and I are using daily. Why that matters? Because blockchain not only cheaper for them, it'll be cheaper for you and everyone as well. Also they need what is called a 'gas' that's transaction costs basically.
If you are in this to get rich in Fiat then no. But if you are in this to protect your wealth once the current monetary system collapse then you are protected and you'll be the new rich.
Companies will not tell you this, banks will not tell you this, government will not tell you this. Because why should they?
Why am I telling you this? Well I'm enjoying a lazy Saturday afternoon here in Japan and just sharing my personal experience as an early investor in some 500SP companies and why many of us see it.
Theres the 1% and then theres the 99%. You want to be with the rest thats fine. Being different and brave is far more rewarding. No matter your background or education.

ATM experience are purely ATM. If you are looking to trade then yes exchanges but you do need to go through KYC. The purpose of this is to actually protect you in case exchange gets hack. Also for them to see you are not involved in money laundering. 
You can always transfer your BTC right after you bought it. 
Or Localbitcoin. This is an OTC and maybe more suited with what you looking for.

There must be some irregularities in the original source of the BTC you bought. It may be stolen coins, hacked coins etc. Of course you wouldn't know this.
How did you acquire the BTC that are locked up in Binance? I'm certain those coins were not purchased from Binance.

Never enter your seed or pass phrases to anyone apart into a new hardwallet. It's like giving your credit card to stranger. 
There are never any guarantees. Shit has happened before with these online mobile wallets and shit will happen again.

Your generation will be the one greatly benefit from BTC. It'll be part of your future and your children and grandchildren. The earlier you invest without worrying whether the price is up or down the greater advantage you have over your peers and those baby boomers bankers.
Right now 1BTC = $10,000 in the future 1BTC = 5 Large houses, or one standard car costs only 0.00001 Sat, or tickets for travel costs only 0.000001. As FIAT sinks in value due to inflation, BTC value. rises due to appreciations,  trust and decentralization.  You see this is the direction little bro.
Much love,

Not really. I live in Japan. I used to mine and now I'm with BFJP. Crypto are self regulating here. 
Tax from Crypto gains are not an issue. It is just not the culture here to make fuss about nothing. Adoption and daily usage are increasing.
Over 50,000 merchants across Japan. We are able to pay utility bills with BTC. Our neighbor S.korea same case. Whatever you read in the papers are all self serving interest for groups and individuals.
BTC, ETH, XRP, Monacoin, NEM are making steady strive. Fiat value doesn't matter.
1BTC = 1BTC. Unlike Fiat ¥ 1000 = Inflation or $ 1000 = Inflation.
So regardless what the fiat value, or what you have read, crypto adoption are increasing.
@_date: 2018-12-20 12:07:21
I doubt you and your friends are in Crypto. 
Fairy tales? Does your friend lived in Osaka being sponsored?
Anyway if your statement makes you happy then good for you.
p.s. I used to study in Singapore. I went to Anderson High School and NTU in the early 90s. I visit Singapore often. I have a place at Chatsworth Road. So I know Singapore well although I'm not a Singaporean.
You nor your friend never went to Nem bar, Mona bar and many establishments with Crypto? Your friends doesnt know or refuses to use BTC at Biccamera Japan? He doesn't pay using crypto in Daimaru department store?
Isn't it obvious that you are a non coiner? Sidelining here on BTC sub reddit.
@_date: 2018-12-04 14:20:59
$1000 = Inflation. If thats the same for you, then don't ever touch any form of currency
@_date: 2018-12-09 10:01:58
Don't be fooled by the price. With everything around the world similar to 2008, example look at Paris right now. Crypto is more needed than ever.
See what Fiat is causing. Rich becomes richer, power hungry leaders, greedy coporations, bank frauds and many more.
1BTC = １BTC
$ 1000 = $ Inflation ( it will never become more than 1000 and will always depreciate )
You may wake up unable to even buy water with $1000 but with Bitcoin value remains the same.
Look beyond the Fiat value. Soon you won't need fiats. Everything, house, goods, health everything you will need crypto.
If you are selling now, you are giving up your future securities. The banks and rich are buying OTC. They are buying in large sums and then dump it so you will sell where then they will buy at lower price.
If you appreciate fiat money, that is your choice. Personally, the world is in cryptocurrency ( BTC ) and Blockchain ( ETH ).
So if you are buying crypto to earn more fiat good for you. But behind the scene the rich are buying up your crypto by doing pump and dump via OTC. 
If you hodl, you make it more expensive for them to buy and they won't have choice but to buy. This is why there are many that believe BTC will moon to 50K. Of course we must work together. 
Fiat will feed you now, but soon you will wish you have more crypto.
Good luck!

I pay my monthly utility bills with BTC, Osaka Gas, Japan Electric, Osaka Water. Also coffee, hair dressers, electrical goods Bic camera Japan, vegetables and fruits farmers market. Lists goes on.
Here are some where you can get cash back in crypto. 
So I don't know what you hear or read, Japan and S.Korea are using crypto daily. 
@_date: 2018-12-21 04:11:55
Ok sure you do. Whatever makes you happy. So that you know, Singapore as you stated in your first comment is not the world's best crypto jurisdiction  for crypto nerd. It is Japan. Japan is the first country to legalize Crypto and Prime Minister Abe encouraged Japanese to actually use it. On top of that Crypto tax are being revised right now.
I don't know what you read or hear, but you are some kind of special I believe. Lol! You do have Vitalik residing there and ETH world event but those are events. Jurisdiction are laws. 
By the way I did not only named Biccamera. I also placed link where you get cashback in BTC and many other places you can use. There are 50,000 merchants across Japan not to mention different crypto bars. Hair dressers have been acceprinf BTC since 2015 although only private ones. But since you never heard others apart Biccamera you assumed they are fake. 
Have you heard of MONAcoin? Japan's own Bitcoin. Launched in 2014. Did you know what happened two days ago? Here's a clue, people in Japan using Crypto. Monacoin is the best performing crypto. Jumped by 93%. 
Value is just bonus. We don't look at Fiat values. Because it is being use.
This is why you are you, special. Lol ! Either socialise more or stay special as you are now.
@_date: 2018-12-20 07:46:15
Ssssh not too loud now. Well written. Just look at BTC volume. You will noticed all top 50 exchanges are not in the US. Add to this there are many OTC buying. 
 While our friends in the US are busy selling this whole 2018 Far East are always buying. Noticed the time of green candles in the charts, which time zones are always lit green. Assets are being transferred to the East. The Aussies are buying as well and Europe. 
Most selling are from the US. When the US are buying we wait, then dump it. We wait for their dump and buy more after few days or weeks. 
Because here in Japan, S.Korea, Singapore, Thailand the rest of ASEANs BTC and ETH are used daily. Yes, this may not makes sense for those living with fake news and FUDs. 
I even pay my utility bills with BTC. Osaka Gas, Japan Electric, Osaka Water. 
Buy coffee, hair salon and buy electronic goods with BTC ( Bic Camera Japan ). Buying clothes at department store.
There are over 50,000 merhants in Japan alone.
While people busy speculating, we are busy adopting and using it.
We even have BTC cash back. For spending fiat you get rewarded in BTC. From online movie rental, Tsutaya, to online shopping, Rakuten. 
Here is the proof for BTC cash back reward:
 
For those who believed in FUDs and Fake news.  You have sold your freedom and future security. It would be difficult for you to rejoin once prices up to $10,000. There are more adopters right now, and actually using BTC.  ETH, Dash, NEM, Monacoin ( Japanese BTC ).
I always say 1BTC =1BTC. So Fiat value doesn't matter to us, although we can buy more cheaper to spend during this bearish period.
Therefore, we here in the East, do not care or worry about what the price of BTC, ETH and other coins. Merchants will adjust the price accordingly. 
Best time for us to buy was last weekend since it was oversold. Although we keep buying since 1 BTC always equals 1 BTC.

If you already have BTC you can use hardwallet to trade directly. Keepkey hardwallet allows you to directly trade. In case you need to buy more BTC unfortunately only Crypto ATM or any exchanges that allows your country. 
In the meantime hardwallet. You won't need to sign up for any exchange. Directly your key, your coin!

Since the little secret is out, I decided why not share it also at a time where BTC is going up. After I wrote my first reply, BTC broke $ 4,000. That was an hour ago. Japan time 17.30 when it started to climb.
Notice now is green and when US wakes up it may go red. This is fine. Wealth are transferred to the East, Europe and Down under. We are actually grateful to shorters and sellers.
