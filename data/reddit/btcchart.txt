If you sell 50% at 1024 and sell 50% at 1300, the avarage is around $1160, if the price does not fall below 1160, you lose money, even if will be a crash at 1300.. The only chance to make more money, if you lucky.

and after you buy back at 1300 and if you unlucky again, will drop to 900, and you panic sell, and three days later again 1300.. :)

$5000 is too high for 1 btc today. maybe next month $5000 will be a very cheap price for it.

The 2 days crash maybe only a little correction of the previous one and half day, when the price went to $750 from $400...

You sold at 1024, and if you have not lucky, you will by back at above 1300... :) Just a friendly remember! I lost so many coins this way..
