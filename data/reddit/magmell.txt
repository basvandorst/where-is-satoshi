I don't blame your skepticism. I didn't really explain things fully. I already have a booth available at a diamond/gold exchange. So all the costs are baked in whether I deal Bitcoins or not. Its up and running with people in and around it that have a speculative mindset about everything. But they tend to be technologically backwards.


My initial thought was to make such a website. But as I said, my clients would be technologically backwards. Even a website might be too much. I was thinking of handing out instructional flyers at my location.

I have connections and experience with diamond and gold buying so the additional *cost* of offering Bitcoin buying/selling at the same high foot trafficked locations would be minimal. I could do it far cheaper manned than via ATM. 
The concern would be A) legal and B) logistical. Basically, making new wallets for each customer, transferring the bitcoins to them, then making physical backups and handing it to them, then properly deleting my local copy of their wallet.
I would be looking to service people who have no idea how Bitcoins work, or even how computers or the internet work. They would just want to buy to speculate. I know there are a lot of such people, especially among the industry I work in (diamond trade)
For my part, I know a decent amount about Bitcoins. I've mined them, bought and sold them on exchanges, created physical backups for a few people, and so forth.
