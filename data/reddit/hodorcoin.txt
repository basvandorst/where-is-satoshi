why should you do that, if you want to rebuy sell now ....

Never, never use any exchange for saving coins :P
For large amounts i would use armory offline wallet with live linux
@_date: 2014-02-24 14:43:22
Open an exchange like mtgox :)
@_date: 2014-02-27 23:52:57
kraken is your better way ...
@_date: 2014-02-25 02:11:04

@_date: 2014-02-24 15:32:28

nice. Any escrow service like at  ?

Can you please make a screenshot from the transaction details from your wallet? Via right-click -&gt; show transaction details
@_date: 2014-02-24 15:36:12
Seems like you have an old version of the client. My transaction details look way different. Please update the client and see what happens. Anyway its strange.

i know, thats confusing
@_date: 2014-02-24 16:07:59
first of all change to offline wallet like armory for more security.
Second transfer the rest of your balance to the offline wallet and see what happens. That will show us more details i think

I really would not choose coinMKT. Try to watch their none existing api documentation.
After gox you should really care about which exchange you trust.
