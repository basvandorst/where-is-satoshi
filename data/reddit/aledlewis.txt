Shouldn't he say 'blockchain', rather than 'Bitcoin'?

I was into this until he started beating up on Dumb and Dumber.

Free Internet advice. What do you expect?
@_date: 2018-02-06 13:27:36
You will get a pretty good indication when it has stabilized or is on a steady upwards trend again. You don't have to buy in exactly at rock bottom. Wait until it ascends again. Whenever you jump back in, it will almost certainly be lower than it is now.
I think folks here need to separate their support of crypto from their monetary investment in crypto. Selling is not a reflection of your belief in bitcoin as a currency, just common sense right now while it tumbles.

Too soon. Wipe out your gains in 6 months.
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:42:25
Because you can minimise your losses.

As someone with no horse in the race... no investment but a interest in the potential of crypto...
If you have bitcoin and you care enough to be checking this sub every day, you surely have to sell. Objectively... it is in freefall and there is no reason for it to stabilize any time soon. Buy back in when it bottoms out and starts to climb again. HODLing is absolute nonsense. Good luck whatever you choose.

You jumped on a slide. Anyone who thinks it will start to correct soon is kidding themselves. Cash out and take a look in a month’s time.
Confidence has evaporated in bitcoin.

I agree, but bitcoin is not comparable to any other investment. It’s bananas. These gains and losses are insane.
@_date: 2018-02-07 02:54:09
No doubt. It’s here to stay. Like I origally said, this is not a commentary on crypto, just this hodl culture for margin traders who tried to catch a wave. I look forward to using bitcoin when it’s stable enough. It’s a betting exchange at the moment.

Just though you might appreciate the thoughts of someone outside the bubble. Don’t need to be a bitcoin grand master to see that it’s a good time to cut your losses.

what trading experience do I or anyone else need to have an opinion on a crypto currency that is crashing?
@_date: 2018-03-18 14:29:30
Bitcoin looks very much like a gold rush still. There may still be crazy highs to come but to be a functional currency, it needs broad adoption and stability and a realistic entry point. The potential and importance of crypto and blockchain is irrefutable.
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:36:24
Alright. No need to get emotional. Good luck!

Every time I see this video I buy 2 more bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-12-05 15:22:08
Have you heard of Invigiron and the healing power of the Abani berry?
@_date: 2018-12-05 15:16:51
I'm waiting until Bitcoin is under $10 to buy in. I'd like to use it as a functional currency, rather than a speculative punt. Good luck to you!

Tip: That was not the bottom.
@_date: 2018-12-08 15:26:23
Can we really call it 'guts' at this point?
@_date: 2018-12-07 11:10:29
As someone who likes the idea of crypto and the blockchain in a non-investment way, I don't understand why you would not sell after it lost about 10% of value. You could always buy back in as soon as it moves steadily upwards again. Can anyone explain why you are still holding? Why not cash out and put it savings until it's clear there is a pick up in fortunes? Is it that expensive to buy and sell? Do you hodl out of a sense of loyalty?
