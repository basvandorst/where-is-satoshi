Not really. Still keeps the supply cap of 21 mil. And everyone still has the option to hold their own private keys if they desire. This keeps “banks”/custodians honest and disables any significant amount of fractional reserve banking.

Good point. Money in a checking account at Wells Fargo has literally zero intrinsic value. It's very ironic that the Fed would post an article like this, because money in a bank account clearly is inferior to bitcoin in both the limited supply sense \(fed growing supply of money &amp; fractional reserve banking\), as well as having to trust various third parties to hold/transact with your money.

Kasego is Japanese for "Let's earn a living."
Yes, we're big fans of Satoshi &amp; Bitcoin.
Kasego will allow buyers to pay in USD ($) or BTC (฿). Sellers/Freelancers can only withdraw in BTC (on-chain or lightning).
This USD -&gt; BTC ramp will allow people around the world to EARN Bitcoin for small jobs rather than "buy" Bitcoin.
Using payouts in Bitcoin lightning, we can drive fees down to much lower than 20&amp; Around 3&amp;
Buyers will be incentivized to pay in BTC because we will make them pay the 3&amp; credit card fee otherwise. But regardless, buyers paying in USD will create demand for BTC due to Kasego converting their money to BTC for the sellers (driving BTC price up).
This will be great for people in countries like India who could use a deflationary currency, rather than a currency that loses 10&amp; of its value or more every year.
Kasego will greatly contribute to Bitcoin's global adoption as more people begin to get rid of (spend) their USD ($) and store their value (hold) in BTC (฿).
We are in the process of building Kasego now, and we would love any feedback/suggestions from Bitcoiners who may use Kasego.

Initially yes that’s probable. But I expect it to rally incredibly hard once we’ve bottomed and the fed has pumped the economy once again. Like gold in 09. But the rally will be far more explosive due to bitcoin still being tiny and it having an absolute scarce supply.
@_date: 2019-02-27 14:31:18
Bitcoin is inevitable regardless of whether this economic political scenario plays out. This is what I think is probable and would speed up bitcoin adoption.

Governments aren't good at banning everything from everyone. Especially if they are trying to ban something that doesn't physically exist. It would only survive human extinction/apocalypse if another organism begins using Bitcoin as it's preferred store of value. And no, the internet is not required for Bitcoin to work. It works via satellite and radio waves as well.

Absolutely. However, Bitcoin moves slow and will only implement new ideas after they have been thoroughly tested and don’t result in alternative trade offs. This is a good thing. Bitcoin will only change if it’s survival depends upon it.
@_date: 2018-03-08 15:16:10
I wouldn't say it's heavily "manipulated". I think the nature of bitcoin is that it's just a illiquid market because of it's fixed supply. I think this guy just didn't understand how to sell BTC OTC or if he even knew what that means. I just looked on GDAX and saw that if someone placed a $100 million USD market sell the price would immediately drop to $2k on that exchange. If it was a $100 million buy order it would go to $17k. Of course people would arbitrage and the price would come back slightly, but I definitely see how a large order on an exchange could confuse the whole market causing massive price swings. (simply because everyone else reacts to the immediate rapid price change)

Funny. Except it's not hypothetical at all. There are over 1,700 lightning testnet nodes online right now. 
It's working and it's already been deployed to mainnet as well. I'm a developer interacting with the testnet now. Lightning is real and coming soon whether you believe it or not.
So say what you want, but a year from now I'm confident a working version of lightning will be deployed to mainnet.
@_date: 2018-03-28 19:21:38
Yeah no doubt. I'm not saying it's wrong. I would do it if I was Bitmain. I think, in a sense, that Bitcoin prices at (cost to mine) act as a price floor.
@_date: 2018-03-04 22:05:05
Saying most of the demand for gold is because of jewelry is just wrong. Gold has backed fiat currencies for thousands of years. In fact most fiat currencies were simply notes redeemable for gold. There are many reasons why gold became known as a global store of value. Additionally, gold was the global reserve for every major currency up until 1971, and since then the US has accumulated 20 trillion dollars in debt. Again more dollars that actually exist.
In fact, did you know that gold has outperformed the US stock market over the past 45 years?
And to.. "the rarest elements would all be the most valuable"..
No, this goes straight back to our first debate of a total supply of 1 bitcoin to 21 million bitcoin. Read above.
I'm done explaining to you why your logic is flawed. If you stored $1,000 of value in bitcoin 5 years ago you'd be pretty happy today. It'll keep going up and eventually you'll either fomo into buying some or you'll be forced to use it when you pay for something.
@_date: 2018-03-29 02:56:27
They also have massive mining farms that control roughly 40% of the hashing power.
@_date: 2018-03-04 20:17:31
Whether bitcoin is "good" or "bad" for the economy is up for debate. There are economists that argue a deflationary currency is actually a good thing: 
People would definitely be more cautious when investing in other assets because the return on hoding bitcoin is and will always bring a greater return than holding dollars.
But the point is it doesn't mater if you think it's bad for the economy. Everyone acts out of their own self-interest and that self interest is to invest in a deflationary asset like bitcoin because it offers great returns.
@_date: 2018-03-28 19:19:20
If Bitmain unloaded thousands of BTC suddenly that would certainly crash the price.
@_date: 2018-03-04 12:47:15
You are missing the point. Yes what you said about fractional reserve is correct but the problems you listed are wrong. “Transactions aren’t cheap” - take a look at the lightning network. It’s practically free and instant transactions using Btc. “The fixed supply is a bad thing” - like the other guy said, fork bitcoin with your new non limited supply bitcoin. Nobody will by it because over time it is guaranteed to decrease in value relative to btc. - inflation vs deflation
@_date: 2018-03-08 14:49:15
I agree with that. I think without a doubt  plays a role as well. People see the price go down of what they perceive as a "risky asset" and they immediately panic sell (especially if they bought in during December)
plus, all of the TA traders who basically just sell when the price is going down and buy when the price is going up.

Yes, Keynesian economists think deflation is a bad thing. However the free market DOES NOT care about what is "good" for the economy. If you can invest in something that will grow (bitcoin) you are going to do it. And please read about Austrian economics - where deflation is not deeply frowned upon.

There is plenty of security in Bitcoin. It's been around for 9 years and the blockchain has never been hacked. The security of your bitcoin comes down to how you want to handle your money.
If you leave it on an exchange, then yes it may not be very secure.
If you have it on a cold storage wallet then nobody can access it without both the wallet and your 4 digit access code. This is more "secure" than my Wells Fargo checking account.
@_date: 2018-03-04 20:44:11
You're missing the point. Before now gold was the best store of value, because of it's scarcity, but bitcoin is far better (as you just pointed out). You can't make more bitcoin available. It's impossible. 
Therefore people decide it's a good store of value (and for many other reasons - read the articles I posted a few comments above). And it's why it will become the best store of value over time.
Bitcoin won't "collapse" it will simply become the global reserve currency once everyone no longer will accept your fiat. -&gt; sidenote: did you know the US government owes more dollars that actually physically exist?
@_date: 2018-02-19 00:56:48
That's exactly why the lightning network will be a game changer. Instant and practically zero fees.
@_date: 2018-03-04 19:40:10
So gold is a thousand year old pyramid scheme as well because "Gains are coming from speculators persuading other speculators to pay 10x for something they paid 1 for, by telling them that it will be worth 10x in the future"?
Same concept, except bitcoin has a more fixed supply than gold and bitcoin is radically more useful.
Obviously bitcoin won't go up forever. It will reach a point where a large amount of the world's wealth is in bitcoin and at that point volatility will become stable.
Bitcoin doesn't care if you think it's a pyramid scheme. It will continue to go up regardless. You can't have 10,000% gains without occasional 80% pull backs- especially as the entire world begins to get introduced to something with perfect scarcity.
(Technically you're right with the pyramid scheme, however it's a self-fulfilling process that will repeat over and over until a large majority of the world's wealth is in bitcoin)

Yes bitcoin takes full advantage of this "deflationary spiral". People hoard until they have enough wealth that they are willing to spend it on something they want - simple economics. This hoarding is exactly why bitcoin has drastically outperformed every asset class over the past 9 years. This isn't a problem:  ... 
Bitcoin is like a black hole sucking in the wealth of the world. This isn't a problem unless you have no bitcoin.
No kidding block reward and hashing difficulty are different concepts. Yes, the fees will be the incentive to mine once rewards end. You cannot do this from the start because, like I said, the hash difficulty of a new network will be practically zero. With a difficulty lower than BTC any of the miners could switch over to your coin (if it ever got any sort of value) and completely control the network (ie take funds). The only way to do what you are saying is to create this new forked coin and immediately convince a majority of bitcoin miners, node operators and hodlers that your coin is the new bitcoin. I wish you luck.

@_date: 2018-03-04 17:23:48
Actually that's not how it works. Simply forking bitcoin with a lower amount of btc will not "decrease the supply". In fact the supply limit will be identical. A "fixed" supply is as scare as you can get no matter if this is 21 million bitcoin or 1 bitcoin. The number itself is arbitrary - it can be infinitely divisible. The trustless system of fixed supply is what is key.
What you're saying is like "a reverse stock split will increase the value of everyone's shares". Which is obviously wrong. If you decrease the amount of shares (or coins) in a 2 to 1 ratio, everyone will have 1/2 of the shares they previously had. Of course this decreases the total supply by 1/2 making every share 2 times more valuable. It's simple math.
(Edit: and decreasing the block reward limit to basically nothing will not work. Your mining hash difficulty will be practically nothing ie: no incentive to mine, unless there is massive demand for using the network. With a hash difficulty of nothing, it makes your entire blockchain completely unsecure and ultimately worthless.)

At this point in time, I'd say Satoshis are worth too little. One Satoshi today is worth $0.00009 dollars. One bit today is worth almost 1 cent. If the price of Bitcoin 10x'd from here, a bit would still be worth only $0.10. \- Still appearing highly undervalued.

It’s not short sighted. It’s a long term change that needs to be done. Post hyperbitcoinization we will need to use bits and satoshis as units of account. This will eventually need to happen, and the benefit of giving the masses a chance to own a full “bit” is icing on the cake.
