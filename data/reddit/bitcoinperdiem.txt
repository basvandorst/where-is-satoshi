Why is this not a "real issue" now?

That link answers none of my questions. 
One transaction per user per week means the entire bitcoin ecosystem can support only ~1,694,000 users.

More powerful mining hardware does nothing to increase the capacity of the bitcoin network though. All higher powered mining equipment does is make the hash you need to generate have more leading zeros.

So we have to wait until 2020 for bitcoin to have the capacity to handle 12 million users who all promise to never make more than two purchases a day? That seems brutally slow.

7 is if every single transaction was the absolute smallest possible transaction. To figure out the practical max divide the average current block size by the average current number of transactions to figure out the average transaction size, then divide 1mb by that average transaction size to find out the number of transactions on average the blockchain could handle per block. The number changes over time but is generally between 2.9 and 2.7 with it tending towards dropping over time as more people include more complex transactions.

look at these two charts:
Divide the two numbers and you get the average transaction size. Now divide 1mb by that size and you can figure out the number of transactions a 1mb block could hold using real instead of ideal transactions. That tells you how many transactions you can do in 10 minutes, divide that to seconds and you figure out how many you get per second, or figure out how many 10 minutes are in a day to figure out transactions per day.

Care to share what you believe the correct math is? If you go by the scalablity wiki and the 7tps lie all you get is a network that can support 500,000 users a day at best. Hardly any better.

Okay, once you are doing that why not just take bitcoin out of the equation entirely? What is bitcoin adding if everything is happening in some internal database for months anyway?

You are correct that people will simply go off blockchain. Using visa and mastercard and dollars and only going "on blockchain" if they need bitcoin specifically (ie. basically never)

Say I own 1% of the hashing power and don't like bitcoin and there is no limit on block size, that means every 1000 minutes on average I could shit a 1tb block into the blockchain of millions of useless transactions I just made. Then the entire bitcoin ecosystem would have to store that 1tb forever and ever till the end of time. (change 1tb to whatever big number you feel is feasible) 
@_date: 2015-02-10 01:02:21
The miners will?

Yeah, but none of that stuff did scale. In the end it all had to be replaced. They had to replace all their hardware and all the protocols they used to get to the point the modern internet was possible. If you are saying bitcoin might get thrown away and replaced someday with something better then maybe. But they weren't even using TCP/IP in 1980, let alone HTTP, the stuff they were using did not, in the end, scale, they were thrown away and replaced.

On "cyber monday" of 2013 amazon sold 36.8 million items. It would take the current blockchain 5 entire months to process that, to process ONE store's sales on ONE single day, if the entire rest of the entire economy was totally shut down and no other transactions of any sort happened for that entire time. When people say technology is getting better I totally buy that. But like, when it needs to leap that far foward it reads like "try again in 30 years" not "we will have this sorted out in the next 2". 
Like I get the grandest goals of things like a country using bitcoin would be 50-100 years in our future and computers have a lot of time to develop before then, but it's not very comforting to think it will be decades of development before bitcoin could even handle a single store's single day. That seems pretty dire.

That just seems like you are saying buzzwords to avoid answering the question. What do sidechains do? How do they help? And is the idea of offchain that coinbase is going to be the global currency and bitcoin is going to just be a teeny tiny little thing off in some corner no one uses? While coinbase's internal database is the real centralized global money ledger?
