Could you seriously pick a worse name for your product?
Still buying it, seems really practical.

Bought in during the fall, no regrets so far. I think it will come back or stabilize around 200 within the next few days, at worst.

This is not a perfect data set for reasons already mentioned, but it is an interesting data point. Thanks for taking the time to put this together.

I love it when bitcoinity does these things, they're always hilarious.

Why don't some of the bars/coffee shops/etc that accept bitcoin offer throw up a listing on localbitcoins and also advertise in their store that they will sell bitcoins for dollars? Could be a nice/easy source of side income and also get new customers to come into the shop.

I have also heard that DeadTerra requires ~250 shares as the minimum to perform a transfer. Burnside requires no minimum shares and doesn't even charge a fee. I'd just open a BTCT account, sell your bitfunder shares, and use the funds to buy PT's on BTCT.

We were around 14 a month ago and now we're at around 25. What really changed in that time period? What legitimate economic reasons justify this massive increase? I think the main thing driving the price up is the fact that the price has gone up so much recently. We're going to have to correct down to somewhere in the 13-18 range sooner or later.

Thanks runeks! Glad I could help!

In 10 years you will be old school if you were in the game on "fork monday".

Update: BTC-E support responded with "will return after one week". 
@_date: 2013-05-31 15:51:54
"De-risking", "unbanked", etc. Are these real words lol?

I don't speculate on the BTC/USD rate short term. I'm holding BTC for the long term. While I'm holding BTC I figure it is good to put some of those BTC to work in the BTC stock markets. This way I realize gains when the BTC rises against the dollar and also when the companies that I invest in do well. I recommend it to anyone else holding BTC long term. 
P.S Entrepreneurs take note, these markets can be a good way to raise capital - a lot of people are holding BTC now and they want to put that BTC to work. If you need funds this could be attractive, especially if your business earns its revenue in bitcoins.

Getting dropbox to accept BTC would be so huge. I know its a minor inconvenience to vote but we're close and its worth it.

How does a company like yahoo expect to be taken seriously when they put out trash articles like this just loaded with inaccuracies.

I wonder if in the future companies that send a lot of transactions through the blockchain will buy ASICMINER shares as a way of getting some of their money back on transaction fees. ASICMINER already has 25-30% of the network hashrate, will likely go up to ~45-50% soon, and returns ~90% of their profits weekly as dividends. Entities that send a lot of tx via the blockchain and own ASICMINER shares will receive a non trivial portion of the tx fees that they pay, with the added bonus of receiving tx fees from everyone else in the network on those shares and also receiving block rewards.

Selling during a panic when the fundamentals have not changed is a great way to lose money. I'm holding and buying with what USD I have.

The reason I transferred passthrough shares into "real" shares is for 3 reasons:
-BTCT.co could go down 
-Passthrough could fail somehow
-Management fees could be imposed upon the passthrough shares
The cost in time and effort was pretty trivial to mitigate these risks. It couldn't have taken me more than 20 mins to do some logins and make some PMs. The cost in money was nothing. Considering the risks I mitigated I'd say it was worth it. 
@_date: 2013-05-15 16:45:48
FYI if you don't want a passthrough share you can buy any amount of shares of the ASICMINER-PT on BTCT.co and then PM burnside on bitcointalk.org and have him transfer the passthrough shares you own to real shares via friedcat. No fees and I had my passthroughs transferred to real shares in less than a day.

I'm not exactly stressing out. I'm just asking the bitcoin community if they know what is going on so I can get some information.
