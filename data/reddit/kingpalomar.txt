The point is that the confirmation bias in this sub can make it pretty delusional at times which is unpleasant. Even smart people can be very delusional. It's important for bitcoiners to see and accept Bitcoin's limitations so it can continue to improve.

Doge has value. It's just that tipping a low value amount of bitcoin isn't as fun because it looks like 0.00001. Otherwise I think people enjoy tipping and spreading the wealth. This is why i look forward to using smaller bitcoin units.

I propose we do a small business Saturday for smaller companies that have started accepting bitcoin. I'm too lazy to start the thread though.

At least they recommended using an offline storage device.
@_date: 2014-01-16 14:58:31
The trade could be done offline once everything was set up. Alice and Bob would just need their numbers/letters. I suppose you could use multisig and still use this scheme with just a transaction rather than a special funded address.
@_date: 2014-01-16 15:18:47
With Multisig:
Alice and Bob agree to use this system. 
They find trusted mediator, Claire, for a 2 of 3 transaction. 
Once Alice sends the bitcoin, Clair provides them both with their block of characters and agrees to cancel the transaction in 72 hours.
Alice and Bob meet in the mountains far from civilization and exchange cash for password.
Bob returns to claire within 72 hours and provides the passphrase.

Ok, I get what your saying, but every time I send a transaction I would have to count zeros. 100000000 = 1btc doesnt that seem a little cumbersome? 
@_date: 2014-02-10 05:57:29
The pschological bias is called unit bias btw. 
Personally, I'd rather it be more apparant that I'm about to send a large sum of money. 1 bitcoin just doent seem like a lot. And remember to enter a decimal each time you enter an amount or you may be in trouble. You may be right. It could be somthing we have to get used to and I just cant see it happening yet but it also seems easy enough to just switch to Mbits or millibits.

* Bitcoins are a digital medium of exchange that can overstep all political and natural borders between two peers.
* Bitcoins can be sent instantly from peer to peer without anyone else cutting in.
* A bitcoin cannot be copied or counterfeited, and the network cannot be hacked, or shut down.  
* Those who participate in the process of verifying bitcoin transactions are rewarded newly created bitcoins.
* The nature of the bitcoin protocol permits only 21 million bitcoins to be created.
* Bitcoins are commonly broken down into smaller sub-units and are infinitely divisible.
* You can buy pretty much buy anything in exchange for bitcoins.

@_date: 2014-03-18 01:25:34
I disagree. To say that we don't tip because our currency is more legitimate seems a little arrogant to me. I feel that we bitcoiners tip less because we don't like sending .0001 btc. Dogecoin is tipped because it's part of the culture and because you can send whole dogecoins. It feels good to receive something whole.

So you're suggesting that we use mills? Why don't we meet in the middle and use millibits?
There is already a list of things that are called bits. It is often used to mean a small piece or quantity of something. It may be boring but it can't be as nerdy as using satoshis.

I used a Keno odds calculator to look at different possibilities. 
n = is the number of characters needed for Alice to fool Bob
N = is the length of the string of characters that conceal the password. (Eg. 25)
D = length of Bob's hidden password.
For example:
n = 5
N = 49
D = 8
= Alice has 1 : 3,026.8 odds of successfully fooling Bob and the password is hidden in a 7x7 square.

I think it's a real problem. You're often dealing with a lot more decimal places with bitcoin. People can easily make the mistake of sending ten times what they intended: 0.001 rather than 0.0001. There is also a psychological bias against owning an incomplete part of something. nobody wants 0.5 anything. They want something whole. I could go on...

What you said makes sense for larger numbers but when using smaller amounts of bitcoin it's easy to miscount the zeros. Eg. 0.001 btc and 0.0001 btc become 1 mbtc and 0.1 mbtc. It's much easier to tell the difference and enter in the correct amount.
