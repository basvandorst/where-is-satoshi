Is this predicting some kind of super inflation of the USD? Where $1 million then is like $10,000 today.
@_date: 2018-06-24 19:48:00
It will rise because selling has stopped. Currently, if all block rewards are sold daily thats a daily selling pressure of $17 million. How can it possibly survive that kind of pressure?
@_date: 2018-06-24 14:56:13
Im not sure why it wouldnt be the floor, when miners are the selling pressure. Miners crush prices. Turn off the miners and the price rises. Pretty simple concept. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 19:49:49
@_date: 2018-06-24 14:51:51
How not? 
* The price falls below the price of electricity
* miners go offline
* which creates less selling pressure
* price rises
Rinse and repeat. 
@_date: 2018-06-28 20:15:32
lol I bet its near a dollar by the end of the year. All interest is gone and the selling pressure created by the miners will not slow. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 19:44:58
Like go-li said transfer rates will very slightly and insignificantly change even if a large portion of the miners go offline. We will never see every miner go offline at the same time simply from the drastic differences in electric rates around the globe. 
But this has to be the biggest misconception in all of crypto. The misconception that somehow the miners support the coin. When the truth is miners destroy coins. Look at any coin that shows major potential. The miners move to that coin and destroy the value. 
Nothing can support the massive selling pressure that miners create. For example btc miners find a block every 10 minutes. At 10k, thats $720,000 an hour. What percent of that do you think is being sold off? Lets say all the block rewards are sold off daily, thats a daily selling pressure of $17.3 million. Its amazing that btc has held its value for as long as it has. This thing is going rock bottom, i mean less than a dollar and the miners are to blame.
@_date: 2018-06-24 19:51:27
Its happening anyway. Like someone else pointed out, if miners go offline, the difficulty drops and rewards are still given every 10 minutes regardless. So there is no way to stop the massive selling pressure created by miners. Get ready for btc under a dollar. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 19:48:52
Good point, this thing is going rock bottom with that kind of daily selling pressure. Less than a dollar rock bottom.
@_date: 2018-06-28 20:18:07
Its not sensitive to news and the prices dont drop because of hacks. 
The problem is the miners, plain and simple. There are too many miners and miners create a huge selling pressure. Interest in btc is gone but the miners selling pressure isnt. Thats what is killing the price.

You mean before amazon came along. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 17:36:04
I was speaking in general, that should have been obvious. So please dont argue semantics. 
Why are you not factoring in your initial loss? Buy at 8k, sell at 7600 is a direct $400 loss that you seem to ignore. 
So say you buy back in 6700 and sell at 7000 for a small profit. You are still at a net loss. 
How long have you been day trading? Im just trying to warn these guys before they lose everything. Day trading is best left to the pros who have a number of services not available to the public that gives them more than an unfair advantage. 
Like i said, one desk of pros has taken 500mil from the rookies, reddit day traders, and fb investors in only 3 months. Dont get rekt. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 00:10:07
1. "The mindset you have is that selling at a lower price is losing money and admitting defeat / failure"
 Because you are. Buying at 8k and selling at 7.6 is a loss. 
2. "regardless of the fact that I literally told you that you'll have more bitcoin by the end of it."
 
 Thats entirely speculative and you cant guarantee that. That type of mentality is why 90% fail. What happens if you sell at 7.6 after taking a $400 loss. You "catch the falling knife" buying back in a 7k, but it continues to drop and you panic sell AGAIN for another $500 loss. Thats where that mentality gets you. You cant guarantee you'll buy at the bottom or that it will ever go back up again. 
I dont wish failure on anyone and wish you the best of luck. But after day trading for the last several years i've seen bitcoin bring out the worst in people. People that have no business trading period trying to day trade. So i hold to the fact that i can not advice anyone to attempt it and holding may be the best option.

You cant predict the future. You can use what ever technical analysis you wish but in the end 90% of traders fail. 40% blow up their account in a month. 
Thats what were seeing with the price of btc. Noobs getting wrecked. Its no coincidence that a week after goldman sachs added a crypto desk that the price of crypto took a dive. They've made over 500 million destroying crypto trading rookies in what 3 months.
And just like to point out a problem with your example. If you bought at 8k and sold at 7600 out of fear, you just lost 5%. And that is a fear sale because you should of had a stop set to cut loses sooner. If you're taking 5% losses on a regular basis you will blow up your account.

The prison is a good reference honestly. But why both the prison and fed reserve may be privetly owned they do follow heavy gov regulation. At the same time there is a lot of leeway both bring in heavy profits.

First of all, great response and i see your point and overall agree but there is a significant difference between them accepting bitcoin and accepting some shitcoins. But a state accepting bitcoin payments is a pretty direct attack on the central banking system which is why you are only currently seeing southern states thinking about this. 
And absolutely, the US will start ww3 before bitcoin replaces the dollar. They essentially have to, just like they have been at war nearly every of its existence to protect its phony petro dollar. 
Bitcoin itself undermines the financial stability of the country. The stock market crashing has nothing to do with the economic strength of the country but more so a move into crypto. A shift in money. 
The US is in trouble regardless. They based their entire system on a dead technology, sale of oil in USD. If the US were smart they'd get a head of the curve and start their own crypto based on oil sales or amount of energy created by solar or something to future proof their economy. But they wont and they'll go to war or the way of the dinosaur to keep the status quo.

You're still missing my point. If you bought in at say 9k, and panic sold at 7.6 you just took a substantial loss. Theres nothing wrong with listening to your charts and setting a stop at say 8990 and getting stopped out. But panic selling for a 15% loss is a sure way to put yourself in the poor house quick.
And me telling you that 99% fail is based off reality. Those are the facts. 90% of ALL traders fail, half in the first month. To the point where most believe day trading is an outright scam and you can not convince them otherwise. Its like gambling, the house always win. You may win from time to time, but at the end of the year you will always be in the red.

That surplus was over a very short period of time. The state is currently in a 1.3 trillion dollar debt that doesnt include massive amounts of infrastructure costs that have been put off for several years. Its a sinking ship. 
6th largest economy but lowest quality of life in the US and more homeless than all of europe. With a 30% increase of homelessness in one year. 
Job growth? Cali is the only state to lose more jobs than it gained, only state to lose more population than it gained. 
Austin texas is currently being called the new silicon valley. There is a massive movement of tech jobs from cali to tx. 
Just think about it this way, what corp would want to pay CA's state corporate tax of 18.5% when texas's corporate tax is 0%?

Unemployment fell because once again the states population decreased. The state lost 4 million people in 5 years. 
Bleeding honest land owners? Bwahaha, CA has an 18.5% corporate state tax on top of the feds. CA also taxes its citizens 13.3% on top of the feds, which is nearly double even the 2nd highest. With the average being around 5%. 
CA had an increase in homelessness by 30% in one year. Thats third world country status. Just look at the "Human wasteland" project. There is literally a feces density map for the city of san fran. 
Texas has a blue voting illegal immigrant problem, but it certianly isnt "turning blue". Conservatives from CA are moving to texes because of liberals regressive polices.
