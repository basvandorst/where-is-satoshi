I mean the business. The biggest thing on the site is advertising bitcoin miner and the portfolio has logos for stuff I can't find online or isn't being used.

This feels like a scam.

No, he's saying that the sender lost all of his balance on the channel - which wasn't nothing, but if he was also the recipient(such as would be the case for testing, say) then he got all of the penalty anyway.

That's not what they're talking about - they're talking about Coinbase employees purchasing BCH ahead of the announcement that Coinbase would be listing it - knowing the announcement was coming.

Please Please Please people. I understand that Rand Paul is a "Libertarian" and his views on technology are great. Do not be a voter who votes based on a single viewpoint of a candidate. He may very well be a perfect candidate for you, but don't let a hot button quote or sound bite be what gives you his vote. Now more than ever we need a public that seeks to be educated on the entire platforms of our candidates, to understand how they view governing *our entire* society. No one is going to entirely agree with any single candidates platform, but letting one issue swing your vote is probably the surest way to be disappointed once a candidate has made it to office.

It's in response to the "OMG really he supports bitcoin? I'm voting for him now!" style comments I've seen.

Could you explain why?

Next day delivery of anything tends to cost like 30-40 dollars. With Vday and a convenience surcharge, that's not too terrible.

Would take an unreasonable amount of work to make it so every image would require a database call, in my mind. Though again, it doesn't matter, if your database can't handle the load, you're still getting ddos'ed, the ends are the same. 
My guess is honestly that the server can't handle the load, as streamlining database usage has been more than enough covered to handle the load that mtGox sees. Servers cost real money.

I'd be interested in helping out as well, not much for economics, but I could help out on the back end.

The problem when a "currency" isn't centralized is that someone has to decide what the value of the currency is. I could go to you and say "This 1 BTC for your 1 Cow" and maybe thats a reasonable price, maybe its not. The only way to do it is look at past transactions, which is what the exchanges function as, particularly MtGox because of sheer volume. It is not that the value is inherently dependent on the exchange, but it is what everyone uses as a barometer(closer to licking your finger and putting it to the wind). On the exchanges, what you have is people speculating, for the most part, on the future value of a commodity. 
And yes, real money backing bitcoin is a good thing, but only if that money is actually backing bitcoin, not sitting there until the most opportune time to be backed out.

I don't know why you got downvoted. This is the exact reason that it is now treated as a commodity rather than a currency. Nobody is moving their money into bitcoins in order to buy good(I know some people are, but the vast majority are not). There's no real reason for me to treat it as a currency when it is *never* more convenient for me to pay using bitcoins. As a commodity, it is all speculation. If it becomes widely adopted, the early supporters will win, absolutely, because as the BTC deflates, every modern currency supports some amount of inflation. Until the bitcoin is a widely accepted **and** convenient method of payment, it is nothing but a stock that people are speculating on.
