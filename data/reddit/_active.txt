That worked. Appreciate it man! I'll be using it for a cold one!

Horrid.

And it's insured by the US Government (assuming you're in the US).

But that's just an asshole move, regardless of present value (unless you're SUPER hard up). Thanks for the present! eBay.

HAYOO! I'm watching with my GF, having some cold ones! Cheers to you, brother!

If the link creation (each digit/number) is random (I'm not sure it is, as I haven't researched it), the probability remains the same as any other combination. 
'FUCK' is not special and has no special probability. Run the numbers (again, under the assumption that it's all random). 
EDIT: also, your math is wrong up there. ^

Please understand that understanding does not equal expertise. I think we all understand what a password is and what it's used for. But you still have the fools setting their password as "pass1" or "letmein".

Hey, thanks, man! Right on. How do I accept it? lol. 
@_date: 2013-12-14 16:59:15
I think you have a good point. I see them all the time.

We have no clue what Chase will bring, if anything.

It's the same probability as all other random addresses.

Shhh. He doesn't understand banking. Don't upset him.

Tried that but it said nothing was pending. I'll try a bit later. If I get it or not, you're the man! :) Hope you have a great night!!

But they don't hand over their PINs. People understand "private keys". 
@_date: 2013-12-18 07:06:20
So they privately "tax" it? Lol
