Oh look, it's a 12 year old kid who can't use mommy's credit card to buy bitcoins and now he's mad. How cute.

It's not like winning the lottery at all. Your friend made an investment and that investment paid off - just like any other investment on the planet.
You seem to be quite jealous over the fact that your friend has put 'little effort' into gaining his wealth..when in fact it wasn't clear that bitcoin would ever succeed in the first place. Yet he set his computer up day and night, probably broke a few graphics cards in the process (investment) not knowing whether it would ever pay off.
Would you also resent a person if they put their life savings on black and doubled up? Being 'normal and hardworking' is very rarely the route to success - because that's what a majority of the world is already doing. To be a success you have to be different.

Yeah, but $20 from every customer is a lot of money 
@_date: 2013-11-19 21:52:03
Are there any decent websites you would recommend? Is it a serious thing to get into, even if I'm only willing to spend £50 for a laugh?
@_date: 2013-12-09 00:57:19
28 Euro's (I assume per month) for giving a bank YOUR money that they ultimately invest and make millions off? That my friend is pure bullshit.
Bank fees are completely alien to me... I live in the UK and the only time we get charged is when we use money that is not ours (i.e overdraft, or credit card usage). I honestly cannot believe that a bank that is already making billions needs more money for actually using your bank account.

I planted my tree today. Thanks for the advice.

It's anonymous if you want it to be. Anyone in the world can set up a wallet and start sending money to anywhere without any form of ID, address, name....
The reason for every transaction being logged is that's how bitcoin works - once you spend a bitcoin it gets verified by the network. The more verifications, the more chance that the bitcoin has been accepted as spent on the network. When people speak of a 51% attack, they're talking about someone who can force transactions to never take place because they can make the network 'agree' that the transaction never happened - even after it appears that person had spent the coin for the first hour or so.

What I don't get, is that armory gave me a 72 length root key that I can use to recover my wallet with...if I'm correct that's 26^72 combinations of root keys that someone can start trying to recover to their own wallet - what does it matter if it's a one way hash when you can just start trying to recover wallets from a series of letters?
edit: typo
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:08:17
Also really expensive...use localbitcoins
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:27:00
The thing is, having it locked away for the future I think is a bad idea. If your bitcoins are worth a few million it would probably be a good idea to cash them out and put them in "real" savings, where there value cannot suddenly disappear overnight or be stolen/lost because of some kind of mishap...
You never know, it could be one massive fad that fades away in a few years time. Then you've gone from potentially owning millions and living off the interest to have nothing - and that would scare me shitless.

Poor or rich? What about those without a computer.

Sigh..me and a friend wanted to get into bitcoins a few years back when they were ~£70 a coin. We worked out we could recoup our investment after about a months mining, but I was utterly broke at the time and shrugged it off... I cannot believe how much these things are selling for now. What makes it worse is that I'm in a position to be able to invest into them, but now the price is beyond my reach again. If the price goes down, even to £200 a bit coin, it's still a massive investment, where as if it were £50 i'd do it for a laugh.
I have an old 5850 lying around, and 7950 in my current pc. Is it even worth getting back into?
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:07:42
If you're in the UK use localbitcoin. No verification necessary (apart from if buyers enforce it) and it has 2 tier authentication. If you find a fast seller they will release bitcoins within a few minutes. Great website.

Getting an offline armory wallet would be your best bet - it's something that's called a deterministic wallet, which means that you can write down 2 lines of letters and it will be backed up forever (instead of using the normal bitcoin client and having to back up after every transaction). Always encrypt your wallet with a complex password, WRITE IT DOWN, and never tell anybody the codes, or they can take all of your bitcoins. 
The biggest problem with starting out is downloading all the previous transactions - armory will do it automatically but it will take about a day... the whole network is pinned on the fact that every transaction is logged, and to 'receive' (not really) and spend your bitcoins you need to be synced to the network. (I say 'not really' because your bitcoins are technically on the network, not in your wallet - you could make a transaction and leave it for decades, come back and they'd still be there).
Anyway I hope that's a little useful bit of information for you.
@_date: 2013-12-02 01:17:02
Does that mean I should keep the bitcoins I bought last week... or not
@_date: 2013-12-03 21:35:42
No, that's a "vanilla" wallet.. armory is another type of wallet (you need to go to their website 
The android app on your phone is its own wallet, and to get funds to it you send them from another wallet to your android... i'm not sure how it actually works since i've never used it, but it is its own wallet.
@_date: 2013-12-09 00:58:26
Just send yourself your own money. Problem solved...although I do agree that sounds fucking stupid.
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:52:19
You could've done the exact same thing yourself, then...but you didn't, and that's your loss.
@_date: 2013-12-09 01:01:19
Whoa hang on. That's not right at all. The banks set themselves up to keep your money on the understanding that they can use your money to invest when you're not using it. They already make money on your money...now they want you to give them even more money after they've made money on your money. Bullshit.
