The chaotic state of US foreign interventions today is even more fucked than it normally is. We are all over the map in terms of how our allies and enemies can expect us to behave. Basically we do not project a clear understanding of what we value, so we have all of these little hellholes that we are particularly abivalent to seeing that they consistently align with our interests. 
For North Korea/... etc., there is no strategic fog whatsoever - from their perspective they either die or win. That's why they will eventually force us to drop out of a conflict that we will come to see as having been a collosal waste of everyone's time, and human lives. Like Iraq. Like Afghanistan for the USSR. Like Vietnam..

i agree with the title but i disagree with what is essentially corporatism as the solution. you won't get a society made up of a million smaller societies, with the power more or less fairly distributed amongst themselves, just because the government legislates a formal separation of powers. There would inevitably be some massive fish and some little fish, just like the real world, because as long as humans are employing other humans that's gonna happen

hah well both Vice and the Intercept have had major relatively  recent OpSec fuckups; the Intercept burned TWO whistleblower sources (Reality Winner last year, and one other reported Mar 30th this year) recently. They burnt an FBI agent by submitting ***FOIA requests for documents they couldn't have known had existed***.. talk about dumb, lol.. 
as for Vice, they very recently (this week?) got someone's Patreon shut down in retaliation for them publicly saying Vice failed to protect her privacy, iirc..
however, what you say about McAfee being dumb for not so much as purging EXIF data... yes, I agree, haha. also look up his alias "stuffmonger", the stuff he was posting online was insane.

and intellectuals play the same role they always have since medieval times - being educated is no cure for a fundamental lack of critical thinking

you say this as if prior to ancel keys laypeople had no evidence-based justification for thinking sugar was fattening. or that there was no campaign that duped the same people who could explain the scientific method but took dictum for fact. or that this is what science in action actually looks like. it takes immense hypocrisy to say "science can't be subjective, but if a scientist produces shoddy work, they're still more responsible than the uneducated masses and should therefore handle the reins" - itself a convenient superstition
[typical disclaimer; i'm in STEM, i belong to the echelon i'm critiquing / not one of the "irresponsible men in the bewildered herd of the laity" etc, to avoid the future stupid qualms with what I'm saying]
