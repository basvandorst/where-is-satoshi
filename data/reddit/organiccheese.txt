it's important not to get caught up in the "waiting", as much as consistently requesting status and deposit, until you have what you paid for. It's YOUR money after all, just as it's important to count your money, as agreed upon in any transaction.

if you intend on actually making production of it, (excess of $1000/day you're required to not only to forward hard copies of notarized info, but in fact "apostilled", (assuming this means a Japanese consul was paid for legal process) with attached documents sent via priority mail... Takes me out of that market....

provided, you live in the continental U.S.A., I would mail you some personally sampled preference of my favorite cheese.

I was in your shoes, and can only assure that they will respond. Speaking for myself, I'm satisfied with the outcome.

nothing precludes you from keeping a solid record of static value (relative to the market you trade on) at the time of your transfer. Provided you can rationally back up your argument/reasoning for what is fair, I'm certain these guys will listen and award you accordingly
