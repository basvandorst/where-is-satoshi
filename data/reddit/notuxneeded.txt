Ya know, he actually did a good job.

Video could be referring to potential future "lock time" transactions where as the sender (or owner of the coins) you could have them returned to you after X amount of time if Y criteria were not met...

The censorship, and exclusion from transacting, is the fee.

Absolutely not. But, I would happily donate to an honest not for profit campaign to promote bitcoin in countries with shaky economies...

Capital controls are already in place, it will be very difficult for the average Greek to move any large amount of money out of the country, let alone into bitcoin.
There will be many who learn about bitcoin, and as they can afford to get involved, perhaps they will. But for the the "people of Greece" to put their money in bitcoin to protect from the economy already collapsing around them, I think we're to late.

Great resource to keep updated!

Have to say, they are getting much better on stage over time...

Bring out the brain wallet extraction machine!

Huh??? 
It's still open source and all the code is available on GitHub.
Under the new license outright copying is not allowed.

Well said, and worth some thought!

Thanks for this!
Thats a fat looking mempool...




How is this node setup? Is it what one might call a "super node" or just an everyday node on the network?

Agreed, this was well played by Kobayashi, however the question remains for who's benefit?

The conference is in Cape Town, South Africa, a center of wealth for the continent. 
I'd rather see it in Kenya....

Many have claimed transaction volume manipulation... After all bitcoin transactions are inexpensive and simple to make, by design.
I say let em tin-foil-hat it all they want, transaction volume has exponentially increased since the beginning, and here is proof it continues to grow.

SWIFT is an oxymoron, unless they realize the enormous benefits of bitcoin they will simply be priced out of the market.
The Honey Badger don't give a shit.

Hey, here is an idea... 
Instead of making your service more restrictive and difficult for people to use, i.e.:


Why not simply fix your API authorization to present a warning to users **before** they login that they are authorizing a third party to make decisions within their accounts.
API access 101, we have all seen this on every major social media site in existence, its not hard to do right, you just have to stop thinking about "how can we restrict our users", and instead think about how can we build our app so that it is secure.
Having a user login to confirm API access for a third party without warning them what they are doing before the fact, yea, with a big red warning box, is just poor design.
Don't make your customers pay for your poor design choices. Fix them.
