LOL total bullshit.   Something that's legitimate and not shilling gets modded in this sub and its due to autopilot or automodding...   Mods you are failing miserably at your role.  It's been getting progressively worse but this is just horrendous

So if this actually worked, how long until they're kidnapped/killed and all their money stolen in the middle of the night?

If you think bitcoins future is reliant on the mass media you are expletive expletive expletive dumb.

Quite possibly!  Tbh I haven't paid much attention to the technology after being so frustrated by it on a past MacBook I had.  Hated the fact that it didn't support audio

They pushed their display port far too long then adopted HDMI after it was already standard on 99% of other machines on the market

Aren't the fraud accusations less than 10 years old?

Sounds like you goofed on your own business and are blaming the hosting service for it.

You do realize bitcoin has only been around since 2008?  In 6-7 years BTC has gone from valueless to having spiked higher than golds price (albeit for a moment)

Bro that's a sick tinfoil hat where'd you get it?!

Most likely not coinbase's fault but because of the credit card companies.  My thoughts are that it is along the same lines of only being able to use Visa to deposit to betting accounts (e.g. sportsbook and twinspires)

Saw this posted in the comments of the thread on the bitcoin foundation resignations.  Interested to hear peoples' reactions

Whoops!  Mods you can delete this one!
@_date: 2014-05-15 05:26:47
If I can I would love to be involved!!!!
@_date: 2014-02-06 20:39:42
Just peeked at it again and the display port you're talking about is far different than what I had!  Gotta get my head back in the game!
@_date: 2014-01-16 15:23:44
But you can make it rain!!!

Happy satoshi Sunday!
