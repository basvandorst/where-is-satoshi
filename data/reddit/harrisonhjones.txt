Is this a giveaway or am I missing something?

Thanks for the info. Sounds like a cool idea! Happy Holidays!

1) I'd use a Sharp Memory LCD. Ive been using them in my projects. Low power and sunlight readable.
2) How about a bluetooth 4.0 on board which you use to push addresses to? Should be fairly trivial
3) sounds like a cool project

I would guess they are buying gift cards and somehow transferring the gift card balance. Since gift cards don't cost full retail face value they can pass the savings as a discount.

To the sending address? Would that not work?

I see where you are coming from but I personally feel that merchants, particularly small merchants, would prefer a low risk Bitcoin solution. The idea of trusting customers is risky. 
I don't really like the shopping cart thing because it's horribly inconvenient. What if you were just popping into the store to grab a drink? You wouldn't want to wait for your coins to clear or for you to have enough virtual coins in your Supermarket account to purchase the item.
Adding in the idea of using Authorizations and not using refunds I think this idea would be decently attractive to merchants. I wonder what small merchants normally pay in terms of %/transaction in CC fees? Around 3%?

That's true. I made it sound like I was only considering small transactions. Perhaps this idea would make more sense with larger, yet "on the go" transactions? Like a nice restaurant or ordering a large number of "to go" items?

Good point. You could use BIP70 or simply have the customer claim the Bitcoins by verifying their credit card details?
@_date: 2013-09-28 18:49:54
Yep! That's true. There's no reason to actually charge the card if you don't have to. Good point. I didn't think this was easily do-able but it turns out it is! I will edit my post
