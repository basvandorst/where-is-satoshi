Slow and awkward is subjective to.

agreed. based on watching coinbase and  coinbase seems to be using some type of average that they are calculating across markets. it's also different than  but fairly close.

click "send" on the main page. you can scan QR or enter email or address.  
@_date: 2013-10-22 17:29:02
some are suggesting that coinbase is basically running their own internal exchange so apparently demand for coins is high at coinbase right now.

Blockchain wallet has your wallet in online account and phone. You lose your phone and it doesn't matter at all. Paper backup not needed.

At the top of the screen there is Send Request Scan. 
Send is pretty self explanatory. Under Request you and have it create a QR code to accept a payment and have the other person scan your screen. (this all assumes you have a coinbase account.

So you're telling me that you understand the "fundamentals" of BTC. LOLZ. This is not a stock. This is not a future. This is not fiat. There are no investment fundamentals other than total number of BTC created, rate of BTC created/day, and current and past trading prices. You either think that demand will continue and that people and companies around the world will adopt BTC or you do not. FOMO can be a legit fear. For BTC to actually work in the long run a bunch of people will have to have or buy BTC. Large sums of people buying BTC will cause the price to increase rapidly. Rapid demand and adoption is not necessarily a bubble.

price already going UP on coinbase. i think a lot of demand is coming from coinbase in USA.

go this message too.

Unless that government then banned the use of bitcoin.

Candy bars.

If you don't know where to get the best rate, then you shouldn't be selling at all. Also, let me know when this crash is happening. It's clear you have insider information. 
@_date: 2013-10-23 20:56:48
Totally agree. Not holding with intent to SELL. Holding with intent to USE.

"Who things things won't change all that quickly should think back to the year 2004. Who could have thought that in 2013 one single company would be charting the lives of more than 1 billion people? Whether Bitcoin becomes the financial equivalent of Facebook remains to be seen."
Apparently dude thinks Bitcoin is a company and that it can "comply with the demands of regulators."  Wrong. Silly dutchmen.

wow, from 530 to 570 in 8 min.

I got the same message. Logging in too fast? Not sure what that means. 
@_date: 2013-11-14 01:30:06
dude, are you 5? This isn't Monopoly bank error in your favor BS. That is not a real thing. 
@_date: 2013-10-25 16:06:05
probably because someone with a crap ton of Bitcoin decided to get fiat rich so they could buy a house or whatever. all it takes is one person with a bunch of Bitcoin they want to unload to bring down the price at this point even if they do it slowly over a day or two. 
@_date: 2013-10-22 19:15:49
blockchain iphone app is not bad. i just send from coinbase to blockchain iphone wallet. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 23:55:24
ha. yeah guys. No memes. Gimme a break. A meme is not going to destabilize bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-10-21 23:36:53
I sent bitcoin from coinbase today. Worked perfectly. 
@_date: 2013-10-24 05:59:57

really? that's you're argument? bitcoins won't increase in value because 3,600 new bitcoins are created everyday. really?

I'm hoping more store owners take the plunge as well. It would be an exciting trend. 
@_date: 2013-10-24 05:24:46
time to buy. 
@_date: 2013-10-24 05:40:03
