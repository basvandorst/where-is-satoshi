Judgmental of you to call it trolling. What does it matter when the conversation started? This is the Internet and conversations last forever.  Please remember Wheaton's Law.


I was venting my frustration that they suck, not that they are a scam. I lost ~$25 to them, just to try it out and have it not work. Coinbase worked for me immediately and without any hassle. I finally transferred the money to Coinbase (after two more fees) and got my money.  


What I mean is, you have a very small sample to be saying "everyone." I am a part of every and my experience is contrary to your claim of everyone.

You realize without replying to a specific person you look like you are just kind of rambling at the room in general, right?

After a year of dealing with these fuckwits they finally tell me I'm going to need a different bank. You know what? No. I've had my bank account for 26 years. fuck off!
I signed up with Coinbase and got my money immediately and didn't have to send them 6 fucking pieces of personally identifying information nor pay a wire fee. Kraken charges fee out the ass. Scam or no, save yourself the headaches, money, and time and go with a competitor

"everyone else" It seems your polling data is off.

I had this same problem and I think it's really odd they want me to sign into my bank account rather than use the routing &amp; account numbers. They don't even list Paypal. What did you go with instead?
