Not exactly sure how protection works on Etsy. But communication records and my btc deposit address are on there , so you can validate payment transaction from buyer...so if buyer doesn't receive product they can open dispute.

Title: **Swancoin** (Otherwise known as Bitcoin Black Swan)
I'm the original creator of this [artwork emblem]( &amp; am releasing a limited edition series. 
**Why the graffiti Black swan metaphor?**
The graffiti medium is anarchic, political and accessible so it suits Bitcoin roots.
*“....hard-to-predict, and rare events that are beyond the realm of normal expectations in history, science, finance, and technology.” part of a quote by: Nassim Nicholas Taleb* 
**Swancoin summary &amp; release notes:** 
There will only be **121** Swancoins ever made. 
I will be releasing these 121 artworks at a gradual rate, diminishing over time. 
Individually hand-crafted onto 30x30cm varnished plywood. 
Each Swancoin can be identified by “Proof of Mark” or unique fingerprints: bumps, blemishes, colours, drips, grains, splats, strokes &amp; scratches.
To compare these unique marks photos of each numbered Swancoin can be accessed on-line and authenticated with ones you might see, hold or want to purchase from a third party. 
Check for latest releases [here]( &amp; [here]( Will be using other services as well in the future. Holding my breath for Openbazzar as well. 
QR code on Swancoin series is the authentication signature ([tagged]( on blockchain.info).  Additionally people spotting Swancoins in the wild could always tip appreciation royalties to the artist ;)
Most musicians receive airtime royalties so people can enjoy listening in their living rooms. It's great that now there's such a simple &amp; elegant tool for physical art forms.
Please note the colours displayed on your screen might not match the originals exactly.

The human figure icoins look cheap and in general the whole design is pretty disappointing and unprofessional looking. Most altcoins have much better homepage designs. I suggest you pay professional designers to come up with something substantual or have a design competition. This is supposed to represent Bitcoin, not some new fly by night scam coin.

no Etsy haven't integrated Bitcoin. But in your shop settings under *" payment options"* you can select *"other"* then state under your product listing that you also accept Bitcoin.  The buyer will then have to contact you and let you know they are paying in Bitcoin, then you settle on exchange rate and forward BTC address. Not the friendliest method , but it worked Ok.
@_date: 2014-02-27 09:23:24

Such bullshit...they're trying to rewrite history here. Gavin's head has grown way to big, he should be thankful that he got so lucky, being at the right place at the right time but he would've never come up with the concept himself. Also what about all the other people that contributed?
@_date: 2014-03-12 16:40:09
Too little to late for the Foundation, they've sown their true colours.

@_date: 2014-05-14 11:29:20
Didn't say it was huge, but definitely had some decent traffic and sales at time of closure. Also the owners did put Bitmit up for sale when it was much smaller and the offers where fairly high at the time..
"As of 28 October 2013, Bitmit had almost 14,000 items listed for sale. Perhaps reflecting bitcoin enthusiasts’ interests, the most popular categories are PC/video games, computer equipment, and money."

Been puzzled and a bit suspicious as to why there's some people pushing for the alternate Bitcoin Ƀ?
Then it struck me...maybe these people/companies wanting to push this Ƀ are the same people that want more Bitcoin regulation, Coin validation and all that shit. So on their part, its a pretty suitable logo design.
@_date: 2014-07-06 17:22:29
@_date: 2014-07-21 14:13:45
You sound like you're part of the agency that came up with the "Ankle bracelet Ƀ" design, trying to justify it with the usual crap. Just do a Bitcoin Google image search and see which symbol appears... anyway, I'm not going to resort to base insults like you've done, shows up your insecurity.

Thank you for advice.

Must say my impression, coming from a design background , is that there's to many Techies and not enough User interface designers evolved in Bitcoin. We all know a smooth user experience is crucial.

Ok, so its the first time Im doing this checksum stuff.
I downloaded *.Zip from github, extracted and did a checksum on the bitaddress html from my usb stick.
@_date: 2013-11-29 18:07:04
Yep it's digital...if you want you can print this stencil  and spray your own :)
@_date: 2013-06-01 09:07:21
I have a problem with the wording .... Why bitcoin.org? This is misinformation as I see it...bitcoin.org is not bitcoin , let people find out for themselves instead of leading them to a crap looking site. 
@_date: 2013-03-22 08:07:44
I agree with you ..just looks cheap! Doesn't inspire confidence. Why dont they get a professional designer?
@_date: 2013-11-11 13:12:22
so, bitcoin is more secure ;)
@_date: 2013-01-26 12:06:23
Thanx, why do you recon they're not trustworthy...aren't they supposed to work on the same principals as Bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-12-11 18:36:46
What a poor, badly designed site BitPay has, I can't even view their list of Merchants...  
@_date: 2013-11-21 21:12:13
Tried out something with curvier lines and less chunky. 
Let me know your thoughts. 
@_date: 2013-03-29 15:28:18
Maybe instead of using the word "Mining" you could use "Auditing"..
@_date: 2013-02-11 11:15:48
They could have all sold out for $$$ to a government entity...
@_date: 2013-04-15 10:03:23
I use Auditing! 
@_date: 2013-05-19 18:00:20
Plenty talented programmers around...
@_date: 2013-12-20 13:20:19

Do you know Where I can get hold of the published hash?
@_date: 2013-12-17 18:15:32
I've just reported it...would be good if more people could do this
@_date: 2013-02-04 22:41:46
They look lovely .....where can I get some?
@_date: 2013-12-23 10:48:32
Also, check out   Andreas is part of the team there.
@_date: 2013-12-03 18:20:47
They need to sort out the Namecoin website, doesnt inspire confidence :(
@_date: 2013-12-04 11:21:31
Prices in Bitcoin would be good?
@_date: 2013-12-04 08:55:33
@_date: 2013-12-13 18:03:16
Funny how they're all so worried about our money...so thoughfull of them, thank you Banksters but I prefere to take my money out of your fraudulent system...
@_date: 2013-01-27 21:03:10
thanks...but can i trade in GBP on Bitstamp?
@_date: 2013-06-06 21:11:15
Yep I'm e vendor, I sell digital goods and in all honesty have not integrated a Bitcoin payment system for my goods as I'm in process of updating my site and shop, also my products are for a  specialist/niche market. Have had many charge backs and have lost a lot of money with paypal. On the other hand I have bought various goods with Bitcoin and have never had a problem, so I've had a smooth experience as a buyer, maybe I'm lucky but all my purchases have gone very smoothly from gold and silver coins, electronics to silkroad goodies. Anyway I really couldn't resist a mischievous dig at Paypal while filling in this survey...Sure, It's pretty bias, but I don't think its that far off the mark either. 
@_date: 2013-02-16 15:03:52
cheers...so is it totally necessary to create a LiveUSB Ubuntu stick?
what if you just run bitadress when your computer is off-line?
@_date: 2013-12-28 23:49:10
Always a great listen...
@_date: 2013-04-12 22:33:42
I was just about to open an account with them...I think I've changed my mind now...
@_date: 2013-05-19 17:06:51
Can I ask why the "Bitcoin Foundation" has to be the only place where you can get the "Core client" and where it's developed...why are they responsible for this...does it not amount to some form of centralisation? Why is there no other client developed that caries out the same functions?
@_date: 2013-05-22 23:55:21
Don't think it's suitable as its really low resolution...if scaled up will be all blurry. Am working on high resolution artwork...just surfing material
@_date: 2013-11-25 18:43:25
Another symbolic Bitcoin creature
...think how shifty they would be get if this was sprayed outside Banks :)
@_date: 2013-11-25 21:44:22
Thanks, What's Shirtoshi?
@_date: 2013-12-22 16:02:03
Yep, one way to keep it honest is by decentralisation and competition ... Bitcoin foundations scattered all over the Globe...
@_date: 2013-12-17 18:51:18
It is not a "Casascius" coin...that's the scam
@_date: 2013-12-23 18:05:59
I know you shouldn't judge a book by its cover...but this Fed guy looks like a proper thug.
@_date: 2013-02-16 15:01:24
thanks ...but way to complicated :)
@_date: 2013-05-11 17:14:48
zip file from Github
@_date: 2013-12-30 17:13:20
Funny, it's almost like most altcoin miners are indirectly mining bitcoin as they mostly trade said altcoin for bitcoin in the end...
@_date: 2013-03-01 13:38:38
Thanks...so will I need a realy large USB key for this?
@_date: 2013-12-22 17:08:15
So does controlling the Alert key prove that the Foundation has central control already? How is this key critical in decision making? 
I don't see why the blockchain needs to fork if the foundation is decentralised/global...
@_date: 2013-11-19 10:34:51
Don't trust these people...did anyone record last nights stream? His closing statement sounded a bit ambiguous ... These guys are in bed with the banksters don't be fooled
@_date: 2013-03-22 08:06:39
Info is there...but design looks real cheap. First impression I get is Mickey Mouse operation...sorry but the previous site looked much more professional. Pay for a designer and sort it out!
@_date: 2013-11-26 07:52:05
Sorry dude the Bitcoin creature has forked!
@_date: 2013-02-06 12:08:44
Thanks...any more? A bit worrying if there's only a couple of places with this critical info...
@_date: 2013-12-05 18:38:53
Isn't this what Namecoin is supposed to do?
@_date: 2013-05-21 10:45:47
I just can't shake off the suspicious feeling that Ripple pays a whole group of spammers... Slick PR campaign .
But paid for spammers are like sales men trying to sell some product they don't really believe in... Bitcoin has thousands of passionate people that believe in it and willingly promote .
@_date: 2013-11-26 07:54:10
I'm in process of doing this, shirts should be available soon.
@_date: 2013-04-21 18:39:14
Like the simplicity in your thinking ...must say mBTC and UBTC confuse me to. So to follow it through do we call 1 BTC - 100M satoshis, bitcents or whatever?
@_date: 2013-02-18 12:03:48
Enter Namecoin?
@_date: 2013-03-23 12:40:07
I think it's because a load of new people got into bitcoin without understanding the fundamentals ....easy to panic.
@_date: 2013-05-10 12:45:22
Thanks for your help
@_date: 2013-11-26 08:00:25
Look, I'm planing on releasing some products with this stencil....so if you're creative make your own version
@_date: 2013-12-12 20:02:24
Maybe murdered by a close "friend"?
@_date: 2013-12-17 18:49:49
It is not a "Casascius" coin...
@_date: 2013-02-16 23:25:58
To expensive !
@_date: 2013-04-24 16:29:34
Thanks for this info...
@_date: 2013-02-21 08:45:48
Thanks so much for your help...
@_date: 2013-05-13 17:54:53
You have a point
@_date: 2013-11-21 20:22:30
Looks like they want to pump and dump litecoin...
@_date: 2013-01-29 13:24:02
that's a bit much! Shouldve got some when they where available :(
@_date: 2013-12-17 09:04:15
Cool, thanks for your support ;)

Same here
@_date: 2013-11-09 19:15:08
It does say on the posting "Fully loaded with 1.00000000 BTC" ...sounds like a lot and it's factual. :)
@_date: 2013-06-06 16:59:42
@_date: 2013-11-27 11:46:05
Thank you...I'm thinking of making a graffiti stencil for download ;)
@_date: 2013-11-27 11:31:54
I'm the creator of this piece, you can support by purchasing a T shirt with artwork here &gt; 
@_date: 2013-05-22 18:31:27
Ok... I did post this about 3 months back...just thought it would be good to share artwork again so whoever didn't catch it then...can use it now...
But I didn't rip if off :( 
here's screen grab of my photoshop project if you need proof that I made it &gt; 
@_date: 2013-04-16 21:26:34
I'm desperate for a new exchange where UK buyers can deposit fiat and to break the centralised Gox problem...I can say what I feel about this site and so can you...but I won't be resorting to cheap shots by calling people names
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:24:30
Its not clear on most of these shops that they have a Bitcoin payment option? Hardly any even have the Bitcoin logo? 
@_date: 2013-02-17 12:45:43
If they want to get Bitcoin clients, they should make it way cheaper for us...could just buy some chunky hard drives for those prices!
@_date: 2013-11-26 11:25:39
Dude, you just traced my artwork 
...why don't you make your own designs ? I'm planning on releasing some products soon.
@_date: 2013-11-21 21:42:11
free to use on the web
@_date: 2013-05-22 16:40:49
Thank you kindly.
 I'll check out flickr
@_date: 2013-12-17 18:34:40
Advertised as "Casascius BTC 1 Physical Bit Coin" blatant lie!
@_date: 2013-04-22 07:39:43
I think mBTC is going to confuse ...need to simplify or bitcoin might never go beyond the early adopter phase...
@_date: 2013-09-09 10:19:34
Don't like the camera on this machine... Wonder if it will stop transactions if you block the lense ?
@_date: 2013-07-09 07:50:06
"The Foundation" needs to sort out their site...looks amature and cheep!

Also, could anyone that's received correspondence from Blockchain on this issue please post here...thanks.
@_date: 2013-11-26 07:49:31
I did create this design and am planning on releasing products, ...make your own version instead of tracing it, I don't mind that you're using the graffiti one on your blog
@_date: 2013-01-26 12:16:47
Makes sense...
@_date: 2013-02-08 16:16:43
yep...Bitbargain. Done a few trades there, smooth, no problems
@_date: 2013-02-07 19:37:50
Thank you. I really expected cost of attack  to be way above 10 to 50 million...like using a hammer to breach a castle. How can this percentage ratio change in the future?
@_date: 2013-11-26 12:44:15
Yeah, this guy has already traced it :(
@_date: 2013-03-13 13:27:43
Not good :( I recently sugested to a friend he should buy his silver from Coinabul...now I will warn him against it...
By the way I know they watch this forum...have they responded in any way? If not their silence seems like an admission of guilt to me.
@_date: 2013-12-23 17:35:34
@_date: 2013-02-16 15:05:39
thanks ...but I dont have the luxury of a spare virgin computer...not many people do

Personally, I think I'd prefere the composition with just one coin though...
@_date: 2013-11-28 11:55:11
Yes! This is the one....Simple and logical solution.
@_date: 2013-04-21 16:24:29
When has government ever invented anything?
@_date: 2013-03-12 10:25:57
@_date: 2013-08-30 14:34:57
What else are they going to copy from Bitcoin?
" About a year ago, Noah Luis — the guy who mints the Litecoin coins in Hawaii — convinced someone on the internet to buy him a pizza in exchange for 3,500 Litecoins, worth $30 at the time. At today’s valuation that medium-sized meat-lover’s pizza was worth $8,400.
Luis says he has no regrets."
@_date: 2013-06-06 17:41:17
I got a little trigger happy giving Bitcoin a ten all the way, was just having fun... It's true , does take away the objectivity...but hey there probably won't even be a human going through all these surveys.
@_date: 2013-02-16 23:40:12
 is pretty good...
@_date: 2013-11-19 13:24:29
Nothing surprising about this...I was more surprised how so many people on here where raving about how nice and positive the hearing was. What they said on the hearing doesn't matter at all, the people that pull the strings are in the shadows . If they see bitcoin as a danger to their power structure they'll do everything to crush it! 
@_date: 2013-04-23 21:22:59

yep :) ill get onto creating a LiveUSB. thanks to all...
@_date: 2013-05-23 11:24:19
Do you mean the bitcoin logo background (circle) or the dollar back?
@_date: 2013-06-19 07:45:14
Nothing personal against Amir...but I suspect the mainstream media love having him on as he somehow discredits bitcoin without needing to pay a shill...he's not media savy and a bit naive. 
@_date: 2013-04-17 06:55:16
Can you recommend a couple?
@_date: 2013-05-19 18:41:49
This is good news...thank you for the info.
@_date: 2013-03-11 15:58:17
Mmm? Same here, wouldnt let me send without "optional" fee. This doesn't seem right, something funny going on...I think they need to let us know why...What's the reasoning behind this? It's not optional any more, its compulsory...so really, it's a lie!
@_date: 2013-11-22 14:43:21
Maybe he was assassinated a long time ago...
@_date: 2013-03-11 15:22:23
I've updated to latest bitcoin-qt v0.8 (widows) and they are still recommending 0.01 fee...makes me feel like they're being a bit cunning. Who benefits from these fees at the moment? Also anyone new to Bitcoin will think this is the norm...
@_date: 2013-11-26 13:30:53
Ok, thanks for reply, apreciated. I have original vector thanks...
@_date: 2013-03-11 17:57:26
It's either "optional" or "compulsory" if I chose to pay 0.005 as a fee why is it rejected?
@_date: 2013-11-25 15:25:49
Might survive for a while, but in my opinion you need something radically useful and new to survive in the long term...and Litecoin doesn't have it. 
@_date: 2013-03-25 13:11:48
My bitcoin-qt v0.8 (widows) is still recommending 0.01 fee as default ...?Transactions  I've made in the past wouldn't go through at a lower fee...what's going on here.? 
@_date: 2013-12-02 17:43:54
Its true they are all hanging onto the coat tails of Big brother Bitcoin.
Competition is good, the worthy Alts will rise to the top...
@_date: 2013-12-03 15:16:23
Hasn't Max Keiser made enough through Bitcoin? Now he's hyping the mostly pre-mined Quarkcoin?
Why is he associating himself with this unproven Altcoin? 
I hope his celebrity status bubble is about to pop! I'm certainly dumping the Keiser.
@_date: 2013-06-06 17:45:20
I know, I know...I really wasn't taking it to seriously ;)
@_date: 2013-03-26 20:44:04
