To simply output your current BTC balance (in BTC) on a *nix shell, just do
    echo "`grep your-gox-id-here mtgox_balances | cut -d'|' -f5` / 100000000" | bc -l
it'll complain (in a non-obvious way) if your id is not in the file (just do `grep your-gox-id-here mtgox_balances` to see if it's there in the first place.)

That hack/bug is not related. That one had to do with shitty developers not ensuring atomic writes to db (mongodb), resulting in a potential race condition which could be exploited. (Why someone would like to use mongodb for critical production code is also an interesting (and related, in the "not ensuring write isolation by default" sense) question, and might be further related through that "shitty developers being shitty" link.)
*edit* the bug you were referring to (that link) was about coinbase, btw. Coinbase uses mongodb.

Hmm. Could you elaborate? Double spending exploit/issue, as in mtgox not seeing the new txids and trying to double-spend the same inputs when being asked to make a withdrawal of someone's coins? How can this be exploited to empty gox's hot wallet? (this is not a rhetorical question; I maybe have an idea, but only a very vague one - hence curious.)
*edit* in retrospect, my question sounds rather silly now :)

Because this thing is self-similar to the whole framework of bitcoin (which this scheme was operating under)? :) a kind of 'as below, so above' thing.

Just so you know, that 30c3 talk also featured [djb]( who basically invented (the use of) curve25519 for crypto. :)


I'm curious, too. Speculation is that it is quite alike (at least sounds familiar to) Namecoin.

Your tool is very nice - one can look up trade data as well as balances - i assume you rebuilt the db tables on your side? Good stuff!
@_date: 2014-02-24 18:20:56
Curious: what's the commerce/speculation ratio for fiat currencies like? (or any pointers to data where it's possible to look this up easily)?

Yes, because issuing a `REINDEX` in an RDBMS is the same as checking all the signatures on the blockchain by computing every transaction with the corresponding public key and checking against the signature/hash on the blockchain. Perhaps not the best wording on their part, but I'm pretty sure it's more than a mere `REINDEX &lt;table_index_name&gt;`.

Thanks a lot for writing up this explanation, Greg. Hopefully it will calm some people down, too.

Reminded me of  (last panel)

iirc, the problem with bitcoinica was that it was hosted as a virtual private server (on linode), hence susceptible to attacks via the hosting provider's control panel, etc.

Has anyone been using Blockchain.info's [MyWallet]( Any incidents / experiences?

Are there no details as to pirateat40's identity? Though I can see your point in trusting the Patrick dude.

So, apparently yes.

Great dude.
Thanks for the link.

*Pssst* this also works for PayPal if the VP(S/N)'s exit IP address is not blacklisted (make sure it's a "dedicated IP address") and, hopefully, reverse-ip doesn't tell much (doesn't resolve to myass13.anon.obviousvpn.com).

Well that sucks. I was stupid enough to use MyBitcoin once (was too lazy to configure the BTC client to go over Tor which I wanted; argh) and still have a bit of money stored there.
Anyone has any more info than it simply being unreachable? I should have researched more before using it. Sucks, really.

Ditto what ForestOfGrins said. I'm very sorry to hear that. I can relate in the sense that I've lost a (much) smaller amount long time ago, and I can only (partially) imagine what it would mean to simply lose coins like that. Life's not over, but it is fucking depressing. Best of luck to you in the future.
