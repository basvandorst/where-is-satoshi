After we improve the onboarding process for new bitcoiners, most of them are buying it to sell at higher price. They look at it as get quick rich scheme. This is not about making money, its about changing money. We need more people who believe in bitcoin, we need more people to follow the absolute best strategy HODL. Only after that we see lambo and moon.

You won't see banks and to be precise govt issued money around in the near future
@_date: 2018-06-08 12:43:12
Hodl is the ultimate strategy.

Agreed but also many of the ico teams dump btc and eth for other safer investments. They dont actually believe in the idea of decentralized alternative to central banking.

Bitcoin will always be the next Bitcoin.

And thats what its all about creating an open and free market for currency. The best will win.

Most of prices are manipulated

Can anyone create Bitcoin without mining? It is backed by Energy. You cannot print Bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-07-13 08:12:44
You know nothing about bitcoin and you know nothing about pyramid schemes.

Oh my sweet summer child!
You have no idea about what Bitcoin is and why was it created. Good luck trying to make more  dollars. 
@_date: 2018-07-12 22:02:52
You can't force people to use it. Fiat is being forced about people and Bitcoin is voluntarily used. Good luck creating something better than Bitcoin.
