They don't hate Bitcoin, they hate that they have no control over it (proved by the patent for their own crypto). If they had complete control over it they'd be pushing it on everyone.

It may not be a crypto in the sense of how we think of one, but I think the underlying principle is that they are not opposed to a virtual currency **that they can control**.
Companies do hold patents that they have no plans of implementing but I don't think that's one of those cases. I believe that any business that can make money off of something, will undoubtedly do it. As we all know, Bitcoin is a huge threat because of it's decentralization and I believe that's what makes it a huge threat.

2 corrections:
* I should have said "long term" success instead of just success.
* I should have said "not one government" instead of "not a government"
Your right, today's news has helped the price rise but so did activity in China a couple weeks ago. Bitcoin is a world currency. The US gov has the choice to either embrace it or not.
How would a world power prevent people from depositing/withdrawing money from bitcoin exchanges? If the US stopped it, the servers would be in China. If China stopped it, the servers could be in Kenya. From an end-user perspective, I could care less where the server is as long as I'm still able to trade. If I wanted to convert to US fiat, localbitcoins.com is a perfect example of trading bitcoins between people in-person (if wanted). If the US wanted to end that, they better take down Cragislist, reddit, and any other online site where you can schedule transfers in person.
The main point I'm trying to make is that it is impossible for the US, or any gov., to kill bitcoin. Similar to how record companies wanted to kill file sharing, or (on a larger scale) how the US would love to kill wikileaks. With Bitcoin there is no 1 failure point (especially now with the multiple amount of exchanges out), neither is there 1 person/group entitled for it's success.

Shit, I wish it was like that in the US. Most ppl here spend all this money for a 4-year degree so they can get out and NOT find a job immediately after anyways smh here's to hoping it pays off eventually tho...

No, it's quite possible. The US will have nothing to do with it's success tho. Bitcoin's success will be hinged upon businesses/people accepting it. Not a government.
