you don't think you're the one blindly following a narrative?
@_date: 2018-01-11 10:08:43


My interest in understanding the tech is completely aligned with my wish to "escape the hamster wheel"; knowing what I'm investing in is precisely why I'm *not* holding bitcoin
I used to be 50/50 ETH/BTC, now I'm 100/0, because learning about it has helped inform my investment
I don't care if you got lucky with Bitcoin or how long you've been in the space; you are not doing a good job explaining why BTC is better than ETH
Half of your post was thinly veiled "I'm a better authority than you on the issue" - well, smartass, why don't you actually address the more interesting and hard to answer questions/statements in my post instead of this cheap bullshit?
@_date: 2018-01-07 22:02:47
You gave 3 reasons, other people addressed them, why don't you address those people before you pretend your reasons are compelling?
@_date: 2018-01-08 06:11:33


oh, ok
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:32:58
you don't think transactions in ETH are well tested?
I don't even get why the argument compels you, it seems so far fetched and meaningless
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:58:08


but that is what I'm talking about; the scope of the conversation ends at 'as a currency' because that's the context I replied to


This was the question. I happen to think: "yeah, why not always use ETH over BTC?"; I see no compelling reasons not to - even if ETH faces more challenges by nature of being far more ambitious, I don't have any reason to think ETH won't work better as a currency in the near to long term (better roadmap, better dev team, far more agile and pragmatic). 
BTC will need exactly the same features ETH is currently working on in order to scale - LN is a complete pipedream and a huge compromise in the first place; so the only reason it's more "secure" is because it's too slow to actually solve the problem. Why does it matter if it's slightly more secure (still on a meaningless level if you ask me) if it's useless?
TL:DR; Yes, ETH slighty less secure (because something like PoS or sharding could impact it as a currency potentially). Does/will it matter? Extremely unlikely, to the point where I think it's desperation to tout it as a strength BTC has
@_date: 2018-01-11 07:08:16
Your whole argument relies on people not just asking the reverse: why use BTC when ETH is better at everything BTC does by a wide margin? 
We're already seeing the effects of ETH being superior; when PoS and sharding start rolling in, BTC will look like a complete joke (even moreso than now)
@_date: 2018-01-12 07:22:20
capacity, usage, functionality
you could also factor in future prospects - ETH's scaling pipeline is much more likely to succeed than LN (which ETH also has btw)
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:21:21


where are you going with this? either a bug is there or it isn't, it may as well be hidden in BTC as in ETH


not sure how many times this shit will get parroted - those are *contract* bugs, not platform bugs. Is it a bitcoin bug if I send BTC to the wrong address? Was the nicehash hack a bitcoin bug?
@_date: 2018-01-11 10:46:51
Short answer: insert some stuff for rthetoric here, that'll throw them off
Long answer: here's a long answer about how I don't write long answers
I hope I never become 1% as insincere and disingenious as you in my lifetime
@_date: 2018-01-12 07:15:50




are you just incompetent? how are you linking the first part of this sentence to the latter like they're logically connected
even if I was a "pumper" (whatever that means to you), how does that deincentivize me to be interested in the tech?


what does this even mean, lol
I should unload my bags so I can buy them again?
@_date: 2018-01-11 07:43:46


I'm a software developer


I guess "sub 30 dollar transaction fee", "network effect", "usable at all", "smart contracts" and so forth are political buzzwords/phrases
you are beyond delusional


you have a fundamental misunderstanding of why ETH is choking; it's choking for the same reason BTC is, in that it has a transaction capacity. The key difference is that ETH starts choking at around 1.2 million tx/day while BTC choked at 300k - *even at 4x the throughput, ETH is around 1/8 the cost of BTC*, this difference will widen by orders of magnitude when (if) PoS/sharding becomes a reality


it destroyed yours, it didn't destroy mine - I'm not fundamentally against hard forks. If a 51% attack happened on BTC tomorrow, would you support a hardfork? Bit of a dilemma you have here, answer carefully


it's fundamentally decentralized with a unified community, which is why ETH can adapt while BTC eats shit


complete bullshit, you can buy some ETC if you like those properties so much (funny how that is not where money and interest is going, huh?)


pretentious and disingenious at the same time, flattering persona you have there
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:22:19
what attack surface? lol
as a currency, it's exactly as safe as btc
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:08:46
*can do* or will do? you simply don't know, and even assuming widespread adoption you'll eventually run into the same problem you began with just to open channels
Ethereum will 100x throughput in the not-so-far future on-chain, and it will *also* have LN (Raiden). 


simply untrue, as it already scales better than Bitcoin, and is on a trajectory to widen the difference
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:33:36


something something segwit


Did I make a claim to the contrary? rofl




No, but it helps - not that I really care about your BTC/BCH feud since both are subsets of Ethereum


Come back to reality; even if every single transaction was done on LN (which will never happen), you'd eventually need sharding


Which is exactly what I said
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:44:32


time to broaden your horizon then
ETH is working on on-chain scaling (PoS first, then sharding); it will ALSO have the equivalent to LN
Bitcoin can't keep up - I suggest you sever your emotional ties to it and actually look at it objectively
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:45:21
The peanut butter sandwich sucks because the nut is rotten, in this case
Bitcoin is truly useless for anything else than speculation and large transactions (which can just as well be done on competing chains, faster and cheaper)
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:49:23
It already handles 2.5x the transactions of bitcoin rofl
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:25:59


Bitcoin needs to transition to PoS and then to sharding to have true scaling, but it will never get there before it's too late. The community dug it's own grave by politicizing it before it was ready to be used.
just look at this - it's embarassing 


Bitcoiners are like this more than anyone else. It's subpar technology (relative to the competitors) rebranded into a store of value. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:46:11


You're naive, it needs adoption, and it has other problems (despite not being ready)


Are you sure you do? It's a scaling tool, not a scaling solution - people will still transact the normal way, and closing and opening channels requires two transactions as well as locking your funds on sidechains. It's not as good as you think it is. 


By sharding the blockchain, which gives you on-chain scaling (x100 capacity in the earliest version) - raiden is just an honorary mention, not the main solution (as it is for bitcoin). 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:56:52
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:02:40
hope you dump those bags before ETH gets sharding
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:51:12


Another coin being better could be the objective truth? It's trivial for me to point how much better ETH is *right now* (tx amount, fees, speed, functionality), but I can also point out that they are solving the scaling problem the way it should be done, by sharding. 
BTC is a subset of Ethereum, and it's worse even in that overlap. It's staring you in the face, but you refuse to see. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:19:49


@_date: 2017-11-06 13:25:23


They're extremely transparent about their roadmap, research and development process - listen on on their weekly live dev discussions and decide for yourself if they seem scammy or disingenuous


If the community didn't want the fork ETC would be the main coin now - a mistake was made and it was resolved in a pragmatic fashion; this is precisely the kind of flexibility a coin should have in it's infancy


Unfiltered bullshit and hypocritical beyond belief


I want to dump it because BTC is a subset of Ethereum, and BTC doesn't have the direction, community, or vision that ETH currently has. I use BTC as a hedge because it still is the dominant coin, not because it's the best coin (it simply isn't). BTC has first mover advantage, what else? I'll tell you: Infighting, slow transactions and retarded fees
There is no conspiracy - hate to burst your bubble
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:03:38
maybe not in this echochamber
those fees make Bitcoin *useless* as a currency, and the problem will only get worse
@_date: 2017-11-27 06:43:34
we both know that's absurdly untrue and unlikely, why are you being dishonest?
@_date: 2017-11-26 15:32:27
In my mind Bitcoin is speculative precisely because it is technologically inferior to the alternative; if you want to invest in something that is likely to actually have real world use, Bitcoin is not the go-to right now, Ethereum is. You are investing in something that may very well become obsolete in the not-so-far future.




Was a bit of a hyperbole - it has uses, but it's inferior to the alternative - you can't send me 10 dollars right now without paying half of that in fees
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:10:55
you're pathetically disingenuous
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:29:55
This is the main strength of ETH and is why Bitcoin can't keep up; it is centralized up to a point where it's producive, but it is still fundamentally decentralized. People who aren't loyal to the team can make their own forks, but there is barely any reason to when the main chain has good competent actors with a loyal community behind it. Bitcoin on the other hand... main chain can't even keep the fees and transaction speed reasonable this early in the game.
It will come to a halt at 100-110 million iirc, and Vitalik has even talked about making it deflationary 


1) It's faster
2) It's cheaper
3) It can do infinitely more
That's the *current* state of ETH vs BTC - give it time and the gap will widen even further
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:57:48


the price can't keep rising forever without underlying value or utility - which is actually the theme of this thread in the first place. Is at an investment or just speculation? I say primarily the ladder
don't know why you assume I'm "failing" - ETH is outdoing BTC on returns this year, and I also held (and hold) BTC
@_date: 2017-11-06 11:47:05
I hold approx 30% BTC but I'm so eager to get out of it because I hold zero belief in the community or the tech - look at the unification, goodwill and ambition within the ETH community (especially the devs) and you're here calling it a scam. I don't get it. Are you being manipulative, narrowminded or delusional? Pick at least 1
@_date: 2017-11-06 13:44:43
I wonder how a person ends up becoming so disinterested in looking at things honestly and sincerely - but that's your prerogative :-)
@_date: 2017-11-27 10:35:42
In terms of 'immutability' being broken - I just don't buy it as a valid point. If a hard fork makes sense from a practical or ethical standpoint, you shouldn't let idealism get in the way of that decision. A certain level of trust in Vitalik and his team is required by the community to ensure the platform gets to a point where it's useful - there is no grounds to assume their interests aren't aligned with the success of the platform. Whatever they decide to do, the community seems to be much more unified than here; how will BTC ever become PoS let alone begin work on sharding in the current climate? Just not likely to happen in a reasonable time frame. 


shards and light clients
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:11:53


people who care about the utility of cryptocurrencies should care - and by extension, so should investors; putting your money in useful technology is less risk


do you even know what you quoted? did you have a stroke?
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:38:56
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:52:47


? k


Money isn't flowing into crypto because it's useful in this instant; people are speculating that it 'becomes the next big thing'. Do you think people will be as eager to put money into BTC when they realise it can't do what it promises to? Maybe you think so, but I don't see why


People a lot smarter than you and I claim the contrary. True scalability requires sharding. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:38:20
here's truth
... and this is just the current state of affairs - imagine what happens if PoS and sharding become a reality for Ethereum; it won't even be comparable at that point. And the very reason this can even happen is *because* ETH has a unified direction, and isn't so tied up in politics and maximalist bullshit. Inserting Vitalik into some 'evil overlord' narrative is hilariously disingenuous and destructive to crypto as a whole; he is in many ways the driving force behind revolutionizing cryptocurrency, and you're shitting on him for your own gain? He doesn't seem like the greedy, self-interested person you're trying to make him out to be, at all
I vote with my money at the end of the day, and my originally 50/50 portfolio is now 90/10 ETH/BTC, because it's clear which coin is moving in the best direction
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:14:09
The landscape is completely different...
- ETH is a superset of BTC (back then there were no serious contenders)
- Fees are becoming prohibitive
- Development and progress is happening on ETH on a completely different scale than on BTC; we're already seeing how much better ETH is BEFORE the big scalability updates, afterwards it's going to be several hundred times faster than BTC on-chain
The writing is on the wall, I'll keep saying it until I'm proven wrong - I see no serious arguments for why BTC will survive (compete) with it's current trajectory
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:54:44
why would you put your money in BTC when ETH is closing in on casper and sharding?
I've been saying it for about 6 months now, the writing has been on the wall the entire time - ETH is solving the problems Bitcoin won't/can't, and since ETH is a superset of BTC, BTC really has no compelling reason to exist
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:05:23
if you say it enough it might become true!
@_date: 2017-06-14 18:13:52
it rhymes with bippening
