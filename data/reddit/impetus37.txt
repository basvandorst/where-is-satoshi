How isnt this bigger news on this sub? 67 upvotes?? wtf

Or use Localbitcoins.com and send it to a secure wallet? I just transfer the amount to seller in online bank and a few hours later ive received the coins. No ID verification or anything.

Ive used Etoro for many years to buy stocks, its only recently that they got into crypto, the spread is quite big and you have no access to the coins.
@_date: 2017-08-12 23:57:16
Spread means you pay more than what the price is, see her: 
Technically its the difference between buy and sell price
No access to coins means you dont really own them, you cant send them somewhere, buy stuff with it. So its more to make money on value increase, not for spending it. But apparantly Etoro customers are insured up to 10k euro or something, unlike many exchanges.

I almost bought 3 BTC in 2013, but the seller couldnt meet me after all, oh well i probably wouldve wasted or sold them after a while. Then i bought at about 2000, so i have almost doubled my money, happy with that.

I wish everyone this happened to would get this much support no matter what the amount is.

I may have killed myself if that was me
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:57:31
Transfering bitcoin instantly? And how many hundred dollars does that cost in fees?
@_date: 2017-11-10 03:13:31
How will you do that?
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:54:19


You dont have to meet someone IRL, wire transfer. Ive done it many times and its safe as LBC is the middleman
@_date: 2018-03-06 14:54:43
But you were able to update eventually? Scary how the device is so buggy
@_date: 2018-03-06 14:58:03
Yeah seeing how half the people in this thread had the update freeze i think ill wait.. A device like this shouldnt have any issues, not acceptable

What determines the size of transactions?
@_date: 2017-05-23 23:54:01
What do you mean by transfer of that size? Would it be lower if i transferred 1 btc?
@_date: 2017-05-31 17:36:56
Okay thanks, what about using Shapeshift, does that increase fees?
@_date: 2017-05-31 19:27:35
I see, maybe thats why i have very high fees. What if i transfer everything to a new wallet, will the size and fee be lower after that?
@_date: 2017-05-24 01:32:12
Right, so for the rich the fees are not high, but for the poor they are very high.
@_date: 2017-05-23 23:52:48
Can someone tell me if 25% fees for a transaction is normal? because thats what i get using dynamic fees with Electrum (0.0025 BTC/kB, Within 25 blocks. It is ridiculous,  if i set it lower, to 0.0005 (the default), how long will a transaction take then? How often is a block found usually?
@_date: 2019-05-22 19:15:26
True but they could ask what 1 BTC is worth though
@_date: 2017-06-21 21:03:11
It would be funny if they didn't
@_date: 2017-06-20 14:32:07
They are worth $40k.
