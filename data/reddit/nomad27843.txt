I have made 5 Bitcoin purchases on Coinbase in the last 2 months and then last week kept getting an error that my purchase was over my limit. Then tried over two dys and got same error message, then a purchase was accepted. I'm not happy with how long it takes to receive the bitcoin or move it from cold storage.
Any other suggestions of where to buy?

Coinbase just lost this American.
I received an email from coinbase asking to verify my employment and source of funds. They stated I was a high volume buyer. I replied the truth that I am unemployed and retired and the funds used to buy coins was from my savings in the acct I transferred from. A minute laster I received a notice my "case" was being further investigated and was assigned a case 
I only bought $14k over thee months in 2-3K lumps. Becuse of Coinbases's policy I was limited to these amounts which caused me to pay higher buy in prices as the prices were rising during my buy in period. I am offended that my situation was termed a "case" as I have nothing to hide and am 100% legal in every aspect of my life. As a result I am closing my Coinbase acct and my GDAX acct and transferring to Bitfinex immediately. If we all voted with our money the corporations would be forced to listen too bad this is not reality.
