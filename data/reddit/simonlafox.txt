Like a lot of left-leaning people, I give Obama a lot of breaks, but his presidency covering the failure to hold anyone accountable after the 2008 collapse will forever serve as a black mark against him. If him and the Democrats in general showed they cared about the plight of regular people more, I don't think we'd have Trump in the White House today.

 - Feminist take on Bitcoin in its earlier days (which gives unintentional hilarity, especially in the first paragraph), but emphasises the point that early Bitcoin adopters are predominantly male.

Gambling addiction is a real thing, and we all know that not everyone trades crypto currencies intelligently. If this program can help some people regain perspective in life and help stop them engaging in habits that genuinely hurt their life and those around them, then I wish it the best.

Weird, sound is fine for me. And it's VEVO so it shouldn't be a music rights thing...

I don't know if you're joking, but he was right.
You ignore the apostrophe for "it" when it's possessive. For instance, mostly you'd say "Mark's pride", never "Marks pride". However with "it" you say "its pride" and never "it's pride".
However, when it's a contraction, such as "Mark is an idiot" to "Mark's an idiot", then the special rule for "it" doesn't apply: "it is stupid" is valid, as is "it's stupid."

Good article, but it doesn't mention one form of the phishing email scam:
An email is sent to you that pretends to have been sent to you by mistake, and pretends that the sender was having trouble getting Bitcoins out of their wallet, and is so attaching their wallet to an email and sending it to someone who they believe can fix it, only to send it to you by mistake.
So if you're greedy, you'll download the attachment, try to open the wallet so you can get the Bitcoins for yourself, and in the process, start a virus program that accesses your Bitcoins and sends them to the theifs.

Funnny that Warren Buffett isn't following his own advice... then again, it worked out for the dot-com bubble, maybe he just heard about Bitcoin a bit too late.

Press and hold the "Clock" button until it flashes then use the +/- buttons to set the time.
Sheesh, it's not rocket science.

That would be very silly of her. Sharing her private key would allow anyone to access her Bitcoins and remove them.
I suppose if you offer to pay her more than her total holding in Bitcoin, she would agree, as that would be simple business.
Yes, I know it was a joke, but I decided to spoil the joke through mundane analysis.

In the original fake article that this fake picture was created for, she used all her 3 lifelines on this question before picking the wrong answer. Then the presenter walked up to her and hit her for being so stupid.
Like I said, it's fake.

Well, it's not Steam but right now you can buy games with Bitcoin on the [Humble Store]( It has it's own sales and you can redeem most of the games on Steam.

I posted an earlier variant of the same scam. It didn't make it to the top of the Bitcoin page though it got a fair few replies.
Lesson learned: Clearly communicating what exactly is going on (hopefully with visuals) will help you gain a lot more attention.

Freedom of Speech (in America at least) means you can't be arrested for something you say. That's pretty much it. Doesn't mean people can't refuse to provide you with services.

I saw this the other day, and only now do I get the pun.

You know, I've always wondered how the whole "legally bribe politicians with campaign contributions" is not brought up far more often in America, despite it have a clearly drastic effect on American society.
I think I've only seen one American movie that even looked at this issue, and that was a 1992 comedy movie starring Eddie Murphy ([the movie is pretty good though](

You have no idea how happy I am that those actions remain on record. We could debate back and forth about whether those actions were right or not, but I'm just glad people remember that happening when viewing the companies.
@_date: 2014-04-07 20:10:08
Thank you very much. That is a clear and informative answer. It seems Bitcoin simply has multiple methods so that if one method doesn't work, it has plenty of redundancy.
Thank you once again.

When a Bitcoin client starts up for the first time, how does it connect to all the other Bitcoin nodes? 
I heard somewhere it connects to a Bitcoin IRC channel, but if so, does that mean if the IRC server went down then no Bitcoin clients would be able to connect to the network?

If you buy Bitcoin now, there's a chance you could gain money but there's also a chance you could lose money. 
Same as always.
You say you want to buy some Bitcoin, then buy it. You won't know whether it was the right moment or not until you decide to sell.

Before anyone even thinks of clicking that link, read this thread: 
Long story short: A guy linked to the attached zip file just like martjoh is doing now. After this, a guy downloaded it onto his computer, virus scanned it (but it came up clean), opened and ran the contents, and lost 23 Bitcoins with absolutely no way of getting them back.
This is a scam, this will steal your Bitcoins, do not even pretend to think otherwise.
@_date: 2013-12-21 16:51:36
You were right (see edit to post). And good idea with the best way to examine its contents without risk, I did something along those lines.
@_date: 2013-08-29 15:38:09


Best way to find out is ask them! Phone them up, say you're curious and then post the answer here to this thread so all the other curious of us can learn the answer.
You're honestly not going to get a better answer other than going directly to the source.

I remember they mentioned it on a recent Season 4 episode, it was fun to hear it. Are you saying they mentioned it on a previous episode too?

Some of the categories have over 20 or over 40 separate pages. That's a lot to browse through.
Some of the specs are also a bit confusingly displayed. Take the PC Tower section for example, there isn't even a new line for each individual spec. Just a bunch of text blobs you've got to pic through. Makes it difficult to quickly compare different purchases.

Ah cool, I get it now, in the Season 4 episode I watched, they were meeting up with a guy and calling him Mr. Bitcoin. He must have been the same character as the one they represented in the episode you're talking about. (In this episode, he was trying to get them on board with a lawsuit about proprietorial overreach given the suicide of Aaron Schwartz. Instead, he ended up getting them entangled with online mob justice over a teen rape victim revealing the name of the rapist against court orders. The Good Wife are really are really good about using online trends for episode elements or ideas).

In fairness, it's somewhat related to Bitcoin as it's both about Apple blocking apps and the promotion of anonymity.

Email Bandcamp and tell them your situation, your Bandcamp page, and how you really want to sell your music for bitcoins.
Bandcamp has impressed me in the past, and they've been responsive in catering for both music producers and consumers (especially giving users the option to chose which of multiple audio formats they can download the song in). They've considered Bitcoin in the past:  but with enough music producers asking for it they may provide it as a payment option.

My Mum and I have gotten into watching The Good Wife. We just find the show clever, fun and with very enjoyable characters.

As a kid, it was utterly frustrating that I couldn't buy countless things because I couldn't have a cheque/credit card until I was 18 years old (a lifetime away, it felt like), and this was before/just as the internet really took off.
So yeah, a digital currency? I would have lapped it up at the time, provided it was accepted in a lot of places and I could top it up easily with real cash.

I love the whole Bitcoin/alpaca socks thing. It's an association that picked up in the early days of Bitcoin and now looks like it just hasn't been shaken.

There's a whole BBC comedy drama based around that concept. It's called Hustle, about a group of conmen who constantly scam all these horrible people out of their money. One of their refrains is that "you can't con an honest man."
While I disagree with the belief, it certainly seems that greed is a good hook (and they use it constantly in the series itself).

I like how the comic pegs onto a genuine aspect of Bitcoins. Serves as a useful reminder of what not to do (and maybe a bit of guidance for those who hadn't thought of this).
