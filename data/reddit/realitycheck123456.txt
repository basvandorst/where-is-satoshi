Lol just like doomsday cults that predict the end of the world and fringe conspiritards predicting global financial meltdowns.  No matter how many times they are wrong, they come up with reasons why they are right.  No matter how obvious it is bitcoin is not succeeding in any way shape or form, there will always be bitcoiners claiming the next wave of mass adoption is RIGHT around the corner.  And despite near unanimous negativity towards bitcoin like the comments in the article, you guys will always just go on believing you are the correct ones.  
@_date: 2015-08-23 18:47:36
Yea but that doesnt push the narrative that the general public is ignorant of bitcoin and then theres nothing to blame a lack of adoption on.

Reminds me of the early days of email.  How long was gmail in beta for, 6 or 7 years?  Email was also widely regarded as a scam and had less than one million worldwide users.  The suddenly gmail came out of beta and BAM just like that, world domination.  
@_date: 2015-08-23 15:52:57
Look at the comments on that article, mass adoption is SO close!

Western Union processes an average of 27 transactions per second which means even 8mb blocks would overload the network indefinitely.  Bitcoin simply can't scale beyond a few million active users.  But that's not what you like to hear when you bet your life savings on it.

...if you even look at the chart, the volume has been increasing on a weekly basis since the beginning.  What is your evidence that regulation has done anything to increase it.  The trend was set long before this regulation.  Look at all of the localbitcoins charts, most of them look exactly like this.  There's no correlation to regulation and increased usage, it's simply an ongoing localbitcoins trend.

Yea look at it, there's a dozen new subscribers per day.  The # increases daily.  
Meanwhile lost 20% of its traffic last month, lost 10% the month prior, and is down 60% over two years.  But hey, the subscribers per day is rising, this bitcoin thing must be taking off!

The Russian GDP is 2.097 trillion annually.  The amount of localbitcoins money being exchanged on a weekly basis is $868,000.  Just a drop in the bucket.

It's Amazon that gets fucked.  Carders buy stuff from Amazon with stolen credit cards, purse takes their cut from the buyer who sends them bitcoins and the items get sent directly to the consumer.  Purse never touches stolen credit card, but Amazon eats the cost.  Purse.io is 100% a scam.

Time and time again people post Coinbase has X number of users, blockchain has Y number of users.  Yea, everyone in the community except newcomers knows that those 2.7 million users Coinbase claims to have is well under 1 million legitimate and verified accounts.

Unfortunately that article is dated by 10 months now.  However, I don't think bitcoin has had much growth since then.  If I had to guess I would say adoption is on par with people leaving bitcoin at moment.  If you add in off chain users of bitcoin to that number, the total number of users worldwide is probably between 500,000 and 2 million. 
@_date: 2015-10-11 03:07:02
Why have you posted a dozen or so times about the issue yet completely ignored the dozens of people reporting their account balances are $0?
@_date: 2015-10-10 23:31:32
And to top that off, those spikes did not move the price one bit.  50k bitcoin "traded" in a minute and it did not affect the price in the slightest.  Yup, totally legit... 12.5 million dollars traded in a single minute and it did not increase the price.  That's more than the "bearwhale" slaying in Oct 2014 by almost double.  Just another day on a Chinese bucket shop.
@_date: 2015-10-11 18:58:36
Right and wrong.  That graph can only be manipulated upward, so using it to prove growth makes it worthless.  But it can't be manipulated downward, so using it to prove a lack of growth is totally valid.  Nobody can sit here and tell me "adoption is happening" when the exact same amount of money transacted today is the same as two years ago.  No matter how much mental gymnastics is applied, the chart does not lie.  Adoption isn't happening.

8mb blocks would give ~24 tps.  And I fail to see how lightning network is a solution to anything.  The whole point of bitcoin is a lack of 3rd parties.  LN turns bitcoin from a P2P network into a hub and spoke network.  And then you introduce all the anti-money laundering laws into those nodes and it's no different than the banking system.  Come up with a real plan.

Because when push comes to shove and people are dying of starvation nobody wants shiny trinkets.  People want food, clothing, medical supplies, water, guns, tangible items.  How is gold going to help me do anything?  If society is going to collapse people aren't going to say "gee we totally need a new currency".  No, people are going to barter, currency will not exist anymore.  You will trade to obtain stuff.  Why do you think the people on doomsday preppers hoard food, guns, water, and liquor?  Nobody hoards gold to survive disasters.  People hoard gold to hedge against faltering economies, but once shit completely hits the fan gold is as useless as toilet paper.

@_date: 2015-10-27 14:21:40
Uhm......no?  I did say the localbitcoins volume isn't as impressive as it appears due to the low dollar amounts behind the trades, but it's obviously increasing.
@_date: 2015-10-20 12:17:33
Well surely you must acknowledge that it's extremely easy to spam the network, as the stress tests have already proved.  Stress tests have added hundreds of thousands (millions?) of useless transactions to that chart, and that's just the ones you are aware of.  Now when you look at graphs of bitcoin transactions excluding chain transactions l[onger than 10]( and [longer than 100]( we see the number of transactions drop significantly.  Additionally, if you look at [transaction volume USD]( you will see it has remained flat for nearly 2 years.  So while the number of transactions is increasing, the value of the transactions is getting smaller and smaller.  I use this as further evidence that a lot of the bitcoin transactions are spammy and or low quality.
Stuff like coin mixing adds tons of useless transactions, on chain casino games add a ton of useless transactions.  When all said and done, I would be surprised if the bitcoin network had over 30,000 legit transactions per day.  
@_date: 2015-10-19 11:52:14


How about the argument that it's a free market and the banks can do whatever they want?  Or do free market principals only matter when they benefit you?  Last I checked banks are privately owned corporations and could do whatever they want.  Or do bitcoiners suddenly want the government to dictate how a private corporation is ran?

He says he has been in the game since late 2013.  Yes, I am very much certain he's excited that his purchasing power has decreased by 80%.  Too bad he didn't hold USD, he would have had a negative inflation rate.  
@_date: 2015-10-19 17:38:13
So in a situation where a fiat currency collapses and there is chaos, unrest, and people starving, you think infrastructure will continue running smoothly to the point where the internet and your internet tokens will be doing OK?  The only thing useful in events you describe is food, water, and guns.  Bitcoin will be more worthless than gold in an economic collapse scenario.
@_date: 2015-10-10 21:23:11
You have no idea what you are talking about.  Just last week Huobi saw record setting volume on a day of total stagnation when nothing was happening because like 50,000 bitcoin were traded in a minute.  This happened back to back days and if you look at the 1-7 day chart they are having "record volume".  More volume than any run up or drop down - during a period of which the bitcoin price is nearly frozen.  Yea ok, totally legit.  If you think Chinese volume isn't completely fake, you're lying to yourself or you are the most gullible person in the world.
@_date: 2015-10-15 20:40:09
Heh, you're on a spectrum alright.  And this post is accurate because areas where economic freedoms are low have low amounts of bitcoin users, and thus low liquidity/volume on exchanges.  Of course the price is higher.
@_date: 2015-10-11 22:30:36
So dumb it's not even worth replying, but let me just note that it's not possible subscribers of a subreddit to go down nor for num wallets to go down.  So right off the bat it's dumb to mention.  It's even dumber when you factor in traffic to and has been consistently dropping month over month for 2 years straight.  LOL  First one isn't even a metric of growth.  Transactions per week is manipulated: see stress test.  And some no-name services have growth is your entire reason then?  Lol k
@_date: 2015-10-09 21:45:45
Anyone intelligent enough to do their own research instead of getting scammed by the bitcoin community into thinking bitcoin is something more than it is - a novelty used for criminal activity. 
@_date: 2015-10-17 00:01:37
Yea if a few hundred million people all decided to make one transaction it would take 3.1 years for bitcoin to process them assuming there was 0 other activity across the world during those 3.1 years.

You are right, universal makes it hyperbole.  I should have used widely instead, which is 100% accurate.
There's daily dosage of what mainstream opinion is like.  And of course you guys can't resist to register for that site which you have never heard of and spread the good word of Satoshi and convince the "ignorant sheep" (actual quote LOL) that they just don't know what they are talking about.
@_date: 2015-10-19 12:06:39
Yes and thank god that is not the reality of things.  We have tried completely free markets and they only benefit big businesses.  They smash competition, promote monopolies, and are all around terrible for everyday consumers.  But the point is that your average bitcoiner believes they are a good thing and that the government should not interfere.  So all of these threads the last couple weeks calling for investigations are so hypocritical it makes my head spin.  The moment bitcoiners don't benefit from a free market they immediately drop all rhetoric they've been spewing and advocate government regulation.  It's both ironic and hypocritical.
@_date: 2015-10-29 15:37:02
Yea let's all ignore the fact that Willy was observed in real time during the Mt Gox era.  Let's also ignore the analyzed Mt Gox database which was analyzed in detail over a period of months.  It was totes China, the country that fakes hundreds of thousands of bitcoins in volume a day!

You dont have a clue what you are talking about.  Purse used to allow the purchase of gift cards but they stopped because high instances of fraud.  People have gotten their homes raided by swat teams for using purse.  What a joke.

Yes perfect analogy.  And just like with today's democracy your opinion only matters if you are a millionaire.  You have 0 say on the network, and the block size debate is a perfect illustration.

They also cagily avoided any mention of the amount of users/volume which the exchange experienced.  And for anyone paying attention the volume over the last 12 hours was literally 30 bitcoins.
