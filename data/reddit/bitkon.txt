Why do I get instant downvoting?

Total lies.
No evidence exists of russians buying Bitcoins just as no evidence was produced of anyone in Cyprus buying them in 2013.
This community will do anything to pretend the price of bitcoin is not collapsing.

The price went to $1k without "bitlicenses", without VCs, without Microsoft and Paypal. 
Also please do not start with the bigger names accepting bitcoin because we all know that is false. They accept US dollars through Bitpay or Coinbase.

I should wake up? Every metric touted by users late 2013 turned out to be false. VC's were claiming over 10 million wallets while we hit maybe 500k unique...

Industry collapse continues to pickup steam.

People were cash advancing credit cards, credit lines etc. I am not talking bullshit, the warning flags are everywhere. Bitcoin no longer responds to positive news, and the Russia melt down did not boost the price ala Cyprus in 2013.

We don't know the quality of those transactions, much of it could be shuffling from 1 adress to another.

You've been pumping bitcoin for months go away.

Your fiat wasn't lost, it was transferred to someone elses pocket. Bitcoin is ZERO sum. You were conned because someone played on your own greed. Man has as many masters as he has vices. Bitcoin enabled more clever people to play on your lust for money. End result, you are 30k poorer while Roger Ver lives in the Caribbean.

Bitcoin is the anti thesis of money.
Choose what economy you want to live in, one where hoarders and idlers are rewarded or one where money is tied to human productivity.
Bitcoin based economy brings out misery for the MAJORITY while minority win, in a real economy those who are productive get to enjoy the fruits of their labor.
Money is anything that can extinguish debt, and only production of wealth can accomplish this. Think about that for a second. Are bitcoins anything? No they aren't. They are wealth transfer tokens that help a tiny few.
Bitcoin developers have no understanding of where value comes from, no understand of history or moral philosophy. The end result is the cluster fuck we've had in this space since 2009. Nakamoto built bitcoin as a self perpetuating ponzi scheme.

Opportunity cost is an excuse modern economists use to justify compound interest.

Why is this getting downvoted?

Sorry I meant dollars worth. In 2014 miners were given $300-500million, which comes in at like $20 per transaction. How is that efficient?
