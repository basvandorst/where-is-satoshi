That was really well written and resonated with me, thank you.

How in gods name did you do that
@_date: 2018-01-18 00:59:05
I would call the original message condescending, would you not?
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:57:09
Unless I am misunderstanding you, you are trying to say that "You are fucked. Market is fine." would be an effective method to relay information. I could not disagree with that more.

So are you looking at other cryptocurrencies that align with your principles, or do you just not think cryptocurrencies are the answer to this problem?
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:11:03
You know, I agree with you, but rather than being a swarmy cunt to someone worried about losing 50% in value in their coins, why not be a little more compassionate and realize that he/she may not have experienced one of these dips before. Even if this isn't their first dip and they are a crypto vet, stop being a condescending dick.

So would you argue laws shouldn't exist?

Just a headsup; I created a Gemini account over three weeks ago and I received the same message. They've warned of longer verification times for awhile now.
For the record, it took me (a citizen of Illinois) just 2 days to get verified.

To work? No, it can work without any government regulation, as long as you like ISP companies having full say about what content you see and don't see.
Although net neutrality is regulation, it shouldn't be thrown into the "all regulation is bad" argument. Could you imagine if banks paid ISPs to upcharge for websites and forums that discussed bitcoin in the early days? Bitcoin as a project (in the US at least) would have fallen flat on its face.

Do some research into Gemini and realize they are waaaay better than Coinbase. You'll thank me later.

Well I have enjoyed this back and forth, but I really don't want to spend time arguing against cop-attacking drones since that sounds absurd to me. I respect your consistency though.
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:54:25
No, that's not true. Monopolies exist in the ISP market which make it impossible for new providers to enter into a market. Do you know how many people want to change ISP but don't have the option to?
Furthermore, I would love to hear how you think the government is using net neutrality as a propaganda machine. With no net neutrality, the Internet becomes a corporate propaganda machine where ISP with political inclinations can shut down speakers they disagree with. More directly to BTC, the ISPs will shut down access to sites at the request of a paying customer, e.g. Bank of America pays Comcast to upcharge access to blockchain.info. Think that's a good idea? Has the federal government done anything related to that on the internet?
I totally get the competition breeds quality, and I do agree with that principle in many different applications. However, this is just not one of them.

40%, seriously?
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:54:41
It took me 2 days to get verified on Gemini. How long have you been waiting?
I'm sure the huge bump of new accounts moving from Coinbase have made verification times even longer.
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:14:02
You haven't been verified in 3 months? My word, I'm hoping you've bombed their customer support
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:13:19
But net neutrality just wasn't a problem to begin with. Can you give me a concrete example of what problem was caused directly and solely because net neutrality existed?
The hypothetical problems of net neutrality seem to come from a "1984" idealistic sentiment, whereas the hypothetical problems of no net neutrality are directly rooted in the history of how corporations and their influencers have acted.

Damn, not sure why I was accepted so quickly. Sorry that you have to deal with that.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:56:18
Gemini is amazing. I fully endorse it!
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:43:33
Could you provide some insight? I don't know the story
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:37:32
Every regulation is backed by violence? I would love any support to that claim, because the rest of your comment is based on it. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:19:23
Thanks for the reply. Is there any way you could be more specific or point me to a source or something? I am new to the crypto sphere and want to learn as much as possible.
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:06:55
Care to elaborate? I don't know much about this situation.
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:15:17
So would you be against a law that would put a murderer who was judged guilty in court by a jury of his/her peers in prison for "x" amount of time? Based on your argument, this law is based on violence, and thus you are opposed to it.
