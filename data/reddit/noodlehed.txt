Of course it can be regulated. WTF is wrong with this sub sometimes?

Of course governments can regulate it. In fact, most already are regulating it to some degree.  Does anyone even think in this sub?
The effectiveness of some regulation is dubious, sure--one could argue that. But that could easily change, too.

Huh?  Online poker has never been close to the same since the regulatory changes in the US.

Oh OK, so we agree I guess. I must have misunderstood your statement.
Yes, it would be a huge chill to Bitcoin if this were to happen. The barrier to entry would be far too high for most US residents to bother transacting in crypto (just like what happened with online poker).

The variance of USD/CAD and USD/BTC differs by orders of magnitude. There is no comparison.
