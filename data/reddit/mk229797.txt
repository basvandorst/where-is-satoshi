"You want to know what the mother of all bubbles was? It came out of nowhere. By chance. They called it the Cambrian Explosion. It happened around 530 million years ago. And over the next 70, 80 million years, the rate of evolution accelerated so fast that we came along. The human race. They still can’t explain how that happened, except that it happened. Some people say it was by chance, others, design. But who really knows?
What is a definition of insanity? It’s doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result. By that standard, most of us are insane. But not at the same time. And on that basis we trust. But can this way of life endure if more and more people are insane at the same time? It becomes, systemic, like cancer. What happens then? Like I said, the mother of all bubbles was the Cambrian Explosion. And it happened by chance over 500 million years ago. Scientists will tell you it was unprecedented, it happened in a flash. And from it, suddenly the world had millions of new species. And from that was born us. The human race. Now, in that sense, bubbles are evolutionary. They kill excess. They lean out the herd. But they never die. They just come back in different forms. When they burst, they give birth to a new day. Always creating change."

Different Transaction Content that with current implementation would get rejected as non standard Transaction and on forked one would only be accepted - eg marker
So on current you have Transaction
And on fork
Current will reject Transaction with xxx as non standard Transaction and fork will require xxx marker to be present so cannot take transaction from one chain and put it on another
Without protection both chains would accept
So if you transfer your bitcoina on current somebody could repmay that Transaction on segwit2x fork - so you will transfer bitcoins on both chains
It is responsobility of segwit2x to implement replay protection because they are hard fork that is changing block structure do changing Transaction structure does not cost extra

@_date: 2017-09-26 20:05:17
Yes you can - what you store in wallet is a private key that allows you to move certain amount of bitcoin on blockchain. You can have many private keys in the wallet, and you can have many copies of the same key in different wallets. When you want to move input (certain amount of bitcoin) to different address you crate a message, and sign it with private key that was used to create that address to which the input is currently assigned. The message is populated over network and goes into memory pool of the mining stations. When new block is created that message may be picked up by the miner (if the difference between input and output - a fee - is high enough) - and included in that block, which becomes new head of the blockchain - and it is then recorded that those bitcoins are now on different address, and to move them it is required to have a private key that was used to create destination address.
PS: coinbase will not give you private key -  - so you cannot have clone of their wallet on your hardware wallet, not even sure if they have designated wallet to access your bitcoins, or just have one big wallet for everybody and just record in database that chunk of belongs to your username.  maybe allows export of private key - look it up. For sure you can share key between e.g.  and  or  (afair)

How long will it take for difficulty to adjust so core nodes running simple cpuminer could start producing blocks if all those greedy asic miners would disappear?

Imagine that you make a deal with somebody to sell him a car for $1000 (but you do not have that car), and when the guy wants car you buy car from the market (if you are lucky by the time when you have to give the car, the price of it is cheaper on the market and you make a profit) - that's naked short selling.
Today you have to borrow car from somewhere before you can make a deal with somebody that you will sell him that car for $1000, and then you can buy a car from the market and give it back to where you did it borrow from. This is new, because naked short selling did cause lots of troubles in 2008 - people ware not able to deliver what they did agree to sell, and on the market there was nothing to buy even for higher price.
Now, how criminals from wall street and banksters operate - because bitcoin is nothing for them (literally - book size of bitcoin is what... 500 of tokens to buy and sell? Banks cannot buy assets from unregulated markets, but can (even with big leverage purchase financial instruments from regulated markets). One of interesting financial instrument is future contract.
In past there was something called forward contract - so farmer and merchants would agree for fair price of grain on the beginning of the year - so if harvest was good, farmers did not have to sell at discount price, and if weather was bad merchants ware not scared that they will have to pay a lot more.
Future contracts are something else, those are bets... bitcoin futures contracts are cash settled bets - so nobody ever buys or sells bitcoin - but can bet what it price will be in the future - can make huge bet, on margin - let that sink in... bitcoin market is unregulated so can do whatever you want - even trade with yourself (bitfinex) - so called wash trades, or flash the market to manipulate the price - or even just buy and buy a little every day as unregulated entity to push price up.
Then on the day when futures contracts expire just sell them all - crash the market - what you will loose... few millions? But as regulated entity you will make a fortune on those bets on futures markets (which value is more then value of all bitcoins - funny - heh?)
Can also do opposite, start selling every day to drop the price - on bets market make long position with leverage - make sure you have lots of collateral - not a problem - if you are a bank you can borrow from other bank money - other bank will create that money for you out of thin air - that's why its called fiat money... maybe other bank will have to store few % of the loan (taken from other clients deposits) in central bank, but in those days banks can just borrow (create/print) money out of nowhere if they will decide that you are credit worthy (and if you are a big bank with lots of asset - you are) - anyway on the day of expiration, start buying as crazy - gemini exchange is regulated - and it influences CBOE futures contract price (CME is kraken/bitstamp/etc) - but even if you do not have account on gemini, and you will start buying as crazy on kraken and bitstamp prices of gemini will also go up (arbitrage opportunity for other traders, robots that just blindly follow other exchanges, etc) and then price goes up... contract expires... you won a bet on fully regulated market, clean money.
And this will continue as long as supply of bitcoin will be enough for big players to play this game.
There is no money, money holds value - all that is there is currency, faith based medium of exchange - this paper bought you bread yesterday, and last year, so you will assume that it will be accepted as payment tomorrow too - even if you have nothing to say how much paper with some numbers on it is there and will be there - and there will be always more - have to be - otherwise the economy would freeze - if you made up $100 dollars, and promise to pay back $110, next year you have to borrow at least $210 - so you can pay back $110 and have another 100 to survive.... if you borrow less e.g. $160, you give back $110, and you are left with $50 - half less money to live on - and you need to payback next year $5... so you have $45 to live on - you economy stagnates, there is depression, civil unrest etc... our economy system is big ponzi scheme that needs more and more - so there is no such thing as debt ceiling - there is not enough money in the world to pay back what world owns to itself...

its called free market - I sell at $10k - so far no buyers, but I do not care :) However advertising by one price, and then changing mind is not the best practice - I would not buy from a guy if we _agreed_ on some price before meeting, and then the goods would not match description or he would like more - a fist explanation that such a behavior is not acceptable would be in order - maybe even take some bonus from them to cover petrol. Usually a OTC seller calculates some premium in price before meeting to avoid such situations. If price is locked then pacta sunt servanda.

Give github link - because I just see MIT - if it would be GPL coinbase would have to show its source code, any wallet, everything would have to be open source if bitcoin would be GPL - but thats one way of changing license - can move from MIT to GPL for all new features as revenge - why not - but there is no coming back from GPL. Can also restrict MIT as author suggested. MIT only means that one needs to state original author, but can release on any license - like Commercial - closed code - most of wallets, coinbase, etc. Anybody can also take bitcoin switch to GPL and start adding new features - and those features if used in any project will cause that project to have to be released as open source GPL. Thats why GPL is called a virus license. But there is nothing stopping Core from modifying license from MIT to forbid non-replay protected forks - in hindsight if that would be done before 0.15 release 2X would have problem - see

In the beginning of year was 1000 USD for 1 BTC, now is 6000 - they are still getting 14.5 BTC - but in beginning of the year it was 14500 USD, now is 87000 USD - every 10 minutes
Did electric power since beginning of the year raise that much? Or are they making a LOT more profit?
Next halving is in 2.5 years ( what will be the bitcoin price then?
If it would even be 1750 USD per BTC (yes, not 17500 USD) in 2.5 year they still would be making the SAME amount of money as of the beginning of this year.

you can add private keys to your bitcoin CORE node 
or use seed words to recover masterkey on another ledger/trezor device, or on mobile phone  app or  (also chrome app) etc.

If you are fine with cartel control, stick to gold and LBMA.
Beside, if miners will have their way it is a signal to any governance that there is somebody that they can chase to enforce rules (NYA signatories) - as this is not an open source project anymore - make mandatory blacklisting of transactions from certain addresses etc. If miners become dev, they cannot say anymore that they do not control the source code.

Pre-fork: move coins to private wallet
Post fork: and some extra coins on one chain to that wallet (freshly mined ones with no history on other chain - so this transaction is not replayable - ones bought on exchange will most likely work too)
Then move all content of that wallet to different address - your coins are now split because it is impossible to reply this transaction on other chain - not enough funds - but just to be sure move all funds on other chain to another different address too.
Of course you could try moving coins at the same time on both chains - and it could work too - however if somebody just for fun will setup relay between chains and republish transactions from one chain to another then you have race condition

And yet somehow the same pools are mining blocks anyway, with 6 block per hour on average. They fight between each - more hardware, be faster then others, etc. If there would be no halving they would be in the same situation.

Simple, give substituted (preferably green) energy to the miners, give some discounts on VAT rates (hardware import to set up the opperations, maybe batteries if there is no wind/sunshine/the river had frozen :P), in exchange require them to create a coinbase transaction that will give you a cut - or pay directly in fiat.

Yep, google is right - have to pay "Stamp Duty" when buying BTC, have to pay 1% of its value in PLN to goverment (within 2 weeks). In case when exchanging BTC to ETH both parties have to pay 1% of more valueble in PLN asset as tax. Excluded from this tax are transactions valued less then 1000 PLN (€250), and tranactions in which VAT taxation occurs - so if you exchange your BTC for goods or services that are VAT taxed, the other party does not have to pay this "stamp duty", because it forwards from you VAT tax payment (23%). So daytraders are in big mess (every buy BTC operation on exchange triggers 1%, do 100 buy/sell - loose all money - no income tax, but still will have to possibly pay more tax then initial investment as aggrageted stamp duty).
Of course selling BTC to PLN, or exchaning BTC to ETH, or buying goods with BTC falls under income tax, so higher rate then capital gains. Disposing BTC is causing need to pay tax even if no PLN, ETH or goods ware received. Allowed offset for BTC is its buying price when calculating figure that falls under income tax (banks statements or exchange ledgers are not a valid proof of purchase -  day traders in very big mess - every sell adds its whole value to a figure used to calculating income tax, and cannot offset buy price - unless did pay stamp duty when buying - or - somehow did receive an invoice from seller).
Selling BTC or exchaning BTC to ETH is subject to VAT, but is VAT exempt - so cannot deduct VAT tax paid on e.g. mining hardware, or other raleted costs. But have to express the PLN value of BTC as value that falls into exemption (yey, more forms!). VAT registered entities who sold their goods for BTC received from non-VAT tax payer, have to sell BTC outside EU to recover whole value of BTC that was given to them in exchange for their goods, otherwise will have to charge 23% of VAT on sell of that BTC, which means ~18.67% loss. (VAT registered day traders are in even bigger mess - everytime when they sell BTC on EU exchange they have to extract VAT from it, unless if other party is e.g. a USA tax payer)
So basically polish goverment consideres bitcoin to be gold. Gold is exempt from VAT, silver is not, and when selling gold have to pay 2% PCC tax. So hodlers are safe.
