The artist isn't robbed of anything. One method of content dissemination is simply becoming obsolete, and therefore less profitable, as much better options currently exist. You could still decide to get around by horse and buggy if you wanted. However, it would be a a mostly fruitless, and very expensive endeavor. 
As an artist, you could also decide to take the really old school distribution route, and only publish your music on vinyl, which would make it more difficult to pirate. However, I imagine this would cost you more than it would profit.
As technologies come and go, people who are dependent on them suffer. Those who can adapt will continue to thrive. Those who can not will have to find new work.

It doesn't seem right because it is meaningless. The network could process 10x the number of transactions while consuming the same amount of power. Then people would say "each transaction could power .157 US households per day. So inefficient!"
The fact of the matter is that power consumption is related to price. The network will not consume more value in energy than value it produces for people as a medium of exchange/store of value/etc.

When your car gets towed, it is under the pretense that you have done something wrong. You have inconvenienced someone, and possibly cost them business. Therefore it is rightfully up to you to incur the costs of removing and storing the vehicle.
If someone freezes your assets under no pretense of wrongdoing, but simply for the benefit of others, that is much more akin to theft. If nothing else, you are absorbing all sorts of opportunity costs from not having full control over your own money.

That is exactly what you are referring to. The transfer of wealth from sire to son does not suddenly become a completely different situation when the transfer is substantial. 
We are born into this world "as is." There are no promises about living standard when you get here. You have to either adapt, or suffer, and that is how it is for everyone, wealthy or poor, and likely how it will always be. That doesn't mean that simply by virtue of existing, you get dibs on anyone else's resources, whether they earned it, or were pedigreed. Why is someone who was born into wealth LESS entitled to that wealth than someone who was neither born into it, and has not earned it? Again, the wealthy can gift their resources to whoever they please. That the recipient is typically their offspring, is immaterial.
"The greater good" is an infamous platitude which can and has been interpreted to mean anything, from wealth redistribution, to genocide. It really means nothing.

There is no direct relationship between the total amount of energy consumed by the network, and the number of transactions being processed by the network. Your statistic is completely meaningless. For you to parrot this exact statistic from a Vice article written by an author who doesn't understand how bitcoin works, while you clearly took no time to do any research, but just rushed to pompously drop this number somewhere as if you knew anything, may indicate that your life is equally meaningless.

Eh... I suppose. In my opinion, socialism represents "wealth redistribution." Since any individual measure of wealth becomes pretty meaningless when everyone has the exact same amount, and since there is no real incentive to be productive beyond basic survival in a communist society, I like to equate communism with "no wealth."

Copyright artificially makes a plentiful product scarce. Data transmission is very cheap. Enforcement of IP laws is a violent transgression against actual property rights. (My hdd, my magnetic bits. I will arrange them how I please.) 
It is not the rights of the artists that are being violated, it is the circumventing of an obsolete, archaic model of distribution which is occurring. The industry behind this model is slowly starting to die out, and it will indeed be a painful process for many, just as it was for the buggy maker when the automobile caught on. 
However, artists are currently thriving. Especially the ones who know how to adapt. There are so many niche genres and artists available, which could have never existed (or gained any exposure) 20 years ago, precisely because of the advent of streaming, file sharing, and the generally open nature of the internet. There are artists who have made careers by streaming and advertising their own content via social media, bypassing the need for any traditional third party distributor. This is also thanks, in part, to advances in consumer level recording and editing technologies.

A mandate to redistribute wealth, which is enacted and enforced by a political party, is socialist, regardless of what amount is being redistributed. In true communism, there would be no wage at all, as supposedly everyone would have equal entitlement to everything, all of the time.
This is why actual communism is likely not even possible in a developed, highly populous society where there is any scarcity of anything. Communist principals act contrary to the very basics of human incentives and motivations.

They are. How is that even controversial? You are allowed to gift anything you have, to anyone you choose. If you have offspring, do you not wish to leave behind your legacy to them after you're gone?
Is this why you support higher taxation? Because you feel that causes you support should not be voluntarily funded, but forcefully?

If you believe that you are entitled to the resources and labor of others, you are a thief.

I understand that there is a high level framework in place in the form of treaties between countries to enforce these laws. I am saying that on an individual basis, if the geographical location at the time of sale is all that matters, then it will be difficult to attain real hard evidence that the consumer was within state borders at the time of sale, particularly in cases where btc is exchanged directly for cash. The only real hope for enforcement would be sting operations.
On the other hand, when buying btc online with personal info, if the buyer uses simple techniques to obfuscate their ip address, there really could not be any evidence that the seller knowingly sold to someone within NY state borders.

That is flat out wrong. The definition of consensus is not "a complete agreement among a set of peers," but rather "a general agreement among a set of peers." There is no built-in implication of what percentage of peers it takes to qualify as "consensus," but unequivocally it is not 100%.

That's from the link. Perhaps it is an accurate description of the law, perhaps not. However, if the law does not apply to residents, as you say, and instead is only dependent upon the location of the buyer at the time, I can't imagine how this law would be considered remotely enforcable.

"Now what I mean by "capital" is the accumulation and concentration of the ownership of the means of production by those who do not work."
I've talked to many socialists before, and many are masters of manipulating language, and redefining words. This is a good, albeit unsophisticated example. Here, you have redefined the word capital from referring to a certain type of good, to describing a specific, uneven distribution of wealth in favor of an arbitrary group, those who "do not work."
In addition, i'm going to assume that what you mean by "work" in this instance, is actually "physical and/or menial labor," as that seems to be the standard definition employed by leftists.
I am fully aware of the Marxist implications of the word "capitalism" in this context, but even among most communists which I have encountered, "capital" usually means "the means of production," or something similar.
Still, thanks for clearing that up for me. You should copy that explanation for future use, and start writing out descriptions of other words which you intend to use unconventionally. Otherwise your conversations will become very convoluted, and directionless due to misunderstandings.

We can know the natural state of economies is capitalistic in nature because the term capitalism is used to describe the economic state of affairs which occurs when people are allowed to pursue their own interests and incentives, without submitting to any arbitrary, de jure, outside forces. 
Simply put, since human individuals ALWAYS tend to pursue their own best interests, we know that when they are allowed to do so in the absence of outward forces, they will. 
As far as your question of why most economies are historically not capitalistic in nature, I have all sorts of half-baked hypotheses about the inevitable centralization of power in the absence of free flowing information, but this would take much more space and time to type than I'm willing to donate to Reddit.

Just because bitcoin eliminates the need for trusting unnecessary third parties, doesn't mean everyone automatically just stops trusting their business partners, best friends, and families. What on earth even gave you this idea?
If you are referring to the dark net markets, there is still a great deal of trust required to do business at the majority of them. There is nothing guaranteeing that the seller will not take your money without sending merchandise, or that the seller will not complain that he didn't receive anything, even if he did.

Yes, the important part of the equation when defining a capitalist economy is the concept of laissez faire, translated as "let do." When the vast majority of interaction between individuals is uninhibited and free, we can call that capitalism. All behavior is not capitalistic, because all possible interactions are not voluntary between individuals.
Of course, as long as humanity exists, there will likely be at least some violence, and therefore not ALL interaction will likely ever be voluntary. However, instances of petty larceny would not disqualify entire macroeconomics from being capitalist.

How secure would that network really be though? They are doing all of this mining for "coins" that are never really meant to be spent, and are thus not really that valuable. Therefore, you would think that the hashing difficulty would need to be adjusted to a very low level in order to make the mining profitable (from collecting whatever fee they charge to store records on their blockchain), but then since the security isn't coming from the expensive hashing algorithm, it relies upon trust between all of the companies involved in this blockchain. This model seems to defeat the purpose of blockchain tech. What am I missing?

This is not on debate anymore, and has not been for years. It's just that no one cares anymore because it is completely irrelevant. If you are still trying to justify the imprisonment of Bradley/Chelsea with this argument, you are simply a government apologist, and should not be taken seriously. Your argument warrants no serious consideration at all.

Human language is indeed complex. One of the things that makes it so complex is having to associate certain contexts with certain meanings.
This is not a socialist subversion or forum, and so it should not be expected that anyone here understands or is aware of the negative connotations that some of your more fringe peers have tacked on to certain words. Although there are many fringe market anarchists here, they generally adhere to the more common understanding of the words "capital," and "capitalism." Despite your own personal ad hoc vocabulary, there is no mainstream association of uneven wealth distribution in the word "capital."
For you to get all condescending when someone questions your specific use of language, which is only utilized by a tiny fraction of speakers, does not make me vulgar. It makes you seem like a prick.

So in light of this evidence of which you were previously unaware, I trust that from now on you will say "No system of anarchy has ever lasted long because they either get conquered, or evolve into something else, usually a dictatorship, EXCEPT when there are not abundant resources available."
This statement would still be a gross oversimplification, and ultimately still wrong, but at least it would be a little closer to reality.

From  early childhood it seems, at least in the US, people are trained to practically worship anyone with a gun and a uniform. In addition to that, we live in an age where the idea of personal responsibility is essentially dead, so it is just too easy for people to dismiss gross abuses of power and authority. After all, the lap dogs are just "doing their job," as if that  exonerates them from all wrong doing.

Not surprising. For whatever reason, in the face of disruptive technologies, legacy companies often seem hostile or passive-aggressive. In the short term it makes sense, because they can't currently make any money with the new stuff. In the long term, it makes no sense at all, because established businesses have the resources to build new infrastructure to integrate new tech, so they could make money from it. 
Bitcoin is like bit torrent all over again, except instead of supplanting centralized content distribution, it is remittance. The companies who adapt will have a chance to thrive, the ones that don't will wither and die. I'm actually surprised that there hasn't been a great deal more hostility toward bitcoin in the payments and remittance sector.

You are correct in the most literal sense. Capitalism is the naturally emergent order of economies and markets when left to their own devices. However, most people subscribe to the false notion that capitalism is just another political power structure. When people have an agenda to push, assigning arbitrary meanings to words is a highly effective strategy, and "capitalism" is fast becoming a casualty of this type of propaganda.

To truly end capitalism, you need to end scarcity entirely. I'm not just talking about making sure everyone is fed, but you would need technology that can endlessly, accurately, and perfectly anticipate and provide for any and every wild human desire, ever. I don't foresee that technology being available even within the next couple dozen generations. Even if it becomes available, we better hope we can find all of the resources necessary on other planets so that everyone can live the extremely lavish lifestyles that everyone would undoubtedly want in an environment where anything is readily available.

Kings, priests, and politicians are not the real oppressors. All they are guilty of is ideas. Ideas are harmless. Speech is harmless.
It is the unthinking pawns and peons which do the bidding of the politician that are the real enemy. They imprison, beat, and kill their fellow man in a weak attempt to escape their own mediocrity. Without these thoughtless peons, eager to march rank and file to do harm unto others for someone else without question, the politician would be nothing more than a harmless, angry, bitter fool.

This is only true on the surface. In reality, there isn't much compatibility between the left and right anarchists, because the true, fundamental disparity between the two lies in the concept of property rights. Purist right anarchists are in favor of absolute private property rights, and purist left anarchists are in favor of common "property." Since this aspect makes up the core of both sides, and they are antithetical stances, the two doctrines are completely incompatible.
It's funny, I used to think that ancaps and ancoms were natural allies too. However, when you catch two of them interacting, it's obvious that they absolutely hate each other.
