Just like how with Bank of America you can't access you money right after you open an account, you're at the mercy of their policies once you decide to keep your money there. It's bullshit. I switched to a credit union a while back and couldn't be happier. Haven't had any problems with buying or selling btc on Coinbase.

Now do one showing how people react when you told them you made $250k over the last two years right after they tell you that Bitcoin is a scam.

Sorry, I haven't used that feature.

Limit (maker) orders on Coinbase Pro. Keeps the exchange fees low, and you can electronic transfer the proceeds to your bank account for free. I've sold about $275k USD worth of BTC over the past two years this way.

I use a credit union, and so far they haven't said a thing. Despite all the rumors, Coinbase has been great for me. I didn't do it all at one time. I've been selling little by little when the price is up. I make sure I pay my taxes, and *don't* try to circumvent the Bank Secrecy Act by transferring amounts smaller than $10k.

Is there an exchange that let's you hold the keys? If the exchange is hacked won't the hacker be able to spend your btc?

Same here. I own a house and have a security clearance. No way I'm risking my house and career! I had to pay both federal *and* state capital gains. With my salary and BTC sales combined, I paid $110k in taxes in 2018. :( Also had to declare it as a windfall with our security officer. They get nervous when they see unexplained wealth. ;)

This was right after I opened an account back in 2007. They wouldn't let me withdraw any money from it. As soon as my funds became available I closed my account.

When bitcoin is low, it will rise again.  
When bitcoin is high, it will fall again.  
Buy when it's low.  
Sell when it's high.  
This is how you beat the hodlers.

Log in to  Click on your user name, and select Banking. There you can link your bank account.
On the Trade page (with the graphs) there's a withdraw button that will let you do an electronic transfer USD to your linked bank account. If you have BTC but no USD then you need to sell some on the exchange. Taker orders (e.g. market orders or limit orders that are filled immediately) pay the highest exchange fees. Maker orders (e.g. limit orders that aren't filled immediately) pay lower exchange fees. They have a lot of good documents that explain the different order types.
It may take a while to confirm your bank account, and you'll raise your daily withdraw limit over time. Mine is currently limited to $100k/day. :D I wish I had the kind of money that made that an issue.

Yeah it was contentious separating the USD from gold, which is why we had silver certificates for a while.

But it's great for roller coasters!

They could accept bitcoin and convert it to fiat.

Technically they end up exactly where they started.

The same reason any business owner does something... to try to make it easier for customers to spend their money with the business. If it's more convenient for some people to pay with crypto, but share holders aren't keen on the company hodling crypto, then the company can convert it to fiat after receiving it. Everyone is happy.

All depends on when you buy and sell.
@_date: 2019-09-08 03:35:25
Thank you.

I personally like the idea, and have both. I think there's room in cryptocurrencies for both.
[Okay... bring it on... let it rain down on me!](
