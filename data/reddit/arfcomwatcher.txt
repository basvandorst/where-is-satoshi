LOL, he saw a way to sucker in some libertards, by convincing them that they needed to "help the bitcoin community" by being bagholders, while he made a commission...

Its funny watching libertardians learning about the iron law of oligarchy...

Well, he is trying to get money from butters, so the fact that this guy got scammed probably helps his street cred with them...

Yep, clearly the Willy bot was the cause of bitcoin's rapid price rise.  In addition, there is no way in hell that the accounting department didnt immediately notice the discrepancies in the bank accounts.  We are talking about bank accounts that were millions or tens of millions of dollars short on a daily basis, with the problem becoming increasingly worse.  This would have been an immediate shitstorm in any accounting department, immediately.
Clearly this scam was perpetrated with the knowledge of the executive(s) at Mt Gox.  Karpeles is going to prison for this fraud, 100%.

In that case, he will keep HODLing...

His valuation means nothing.  In reality he gave someone less than a quarter...
You butters.... sheesh...

How would Wells Fargo be negligent?  The guy obviously had his accountant as an authorized user of the company's account, so when Wells Fargo received a wire request, they sent out the $50 grand as requested...
