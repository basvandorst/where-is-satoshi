The main cost for you then is wear on your GPU(s).  Running them continuously will wear them out faster than would have happened otherwise, but hopefully you will have earned more in bitcoins than the cost of your GPU.
The whole situation is moot if you replace graphics cards faster than mining wears them out.

My bank refunded my money.  I would talk to them (or whoever issued your credit or debit card...hope you didn't pay with BTC).
@_date: 2013-01-20 17:58:14
I'll be sad that I didn't order from them if this turns out to be real, but I still hope it is so another batch of people aren't cheated out of their money like with BTCFPGA.
@_date: 2013-01-14 00:38:32
Oh, I believe that as well.  Why I'm not ordering anything from them
@_date: 2013-01-25 06:08:12
Yeah, he didn't even try to hide that one.

Is there a decent guide out there on maintaining, using, and protecting your wallet out there?  
Most I've found only talk about web-based wallets and those make me nervous.

For better (hopefully) or worse, guys, this is Evorhees' explanation.  This should be upvoted to the top just so more people can see his defense in addition to the heated speculation.

These are the three main claims that I've heard from the ASIC companies:
1) They want to support bitcoin and get as many people involved as possible.
2) If one entity controls enough of the network to initiate a 51% attack, others will lose faith in the system, and bitcoins will plummet in value.
3) "When there's a goldrush, sell shovels."  In other words, they believe more money will be generated by selling the ASIC rigs than would be made by mining coins.

Sadly no one is meeting  yet, and information on 1 and 2 is scarce.
Hopefully we'll learn more soon.

Reddit recursion.

I forget his name, but, based on the hash rate reported by one of the first two people to get an Avalon ASIC, people concluded the machine was earning minimum wage (albeit twenty-four hours a day in theory).
That machine has a big advantage of being one of the first ASICs to go live, so that return is expected to diminish with every other ASIC that comes on line.  So...you're definitely right.  It'll be a while before a many ASIC enthusiasts make their money back.

To be fair, I've heard the guy making the video was harassing the BFL guys the day before.

I may do the same thing you are if I'm covered.  Happy hunting to us both.  Still bugs me that our money could be better invested elsewhere.
@_date: 2013-02-13 20:07:34
That was my thought.  They could hire an editor and put some of those jobless English majors to work.

I would suggest going to Wal-Mart for this.  They deal with money orders much more often and care much less.  
The people at CVS demanded a ton of info and were unable to help me even after an hour of struggling.
@_date: 2013-01-22 17:07:06
I am also interested to know.  Can you provide any proof of previous earnings, Devdach?
@_date: 2013-01-21 20:19:50
Indeed.  I'd love to have an ASIC rig, but I don't think I can trust any of the companies until they start shipping working product.
@_date: 2013-01-10 11:47:27
I was looking into getting more hardware, but GPUs are nowhere near cost effective for that (especially if ASICs turn out to be real).

Debit card (bad choice, I know), about 4 days ago.
edit: Talked to my bank, and they're more than happy to give me all of my money back.  They asked I wait 15 days to give the company time to handle things on their end, but, after that, my bank will declare it fraud if I haven't heard anything.

ship = 'False';
while ship = 'False';
announcement_date = 9;
if product_finished != 9
     
    announcement_date = announcement_date+1;
     ship = 'True';

Even when I used the red phone, I couldn't get it cleared up.  Wal-Mart was a breeze.
@_date: 2013-02-13 16:00:58
Is it just me or does the FAQ jump back and forth between saying that one ticket costs 0.01BTC and 0.1BTC?  
Additionally, they alternatingly use commas (,) and periods (.) to indicate a decimal.  Ideally they'd pick one or the other.
@_date: 2013-01-14 11:10:54
Yeah, the company would be more trustworthy if they hadn't promised product back in September...
@_date: 2013-02-08 17:46:51
Certainly it's a good deal at the beginning when almost no one else has an ASIC, but it's sure to go down quickly as others come online.  Then there's the cost of electricity, the device failing or going down, etc.
I hope you get one early (and really wish I had one of my own).  Good luck!
@_date: 2013-01-14 06:41:43
Ah, thanks.  Hadn't noticed that.
@_date: 2013-01-21 05:27:30
After their recent issues including drunken rants by the president and the head of marketing encouraging all customers to get refunds...I wouldn't trust them with a penny.
@_date: 2013-02-01 04:52:08
I didn't go through the full process, but it seems you can get pretty far into the order form...
Me thinks they might be happy to take your money.
@_date: 2013-01-10 11:46:01
I poked around the BFL stuff and they seemed a bit sketchy to me at the time.  Some of the research was just me googling things and some was from r/bitcoin, but I didn't trust them based on whatever I read (exactly what that was escapes me right at this moment).
Talk to your bank or card issuer and see if they'll refund your money if the product isn't delivered in March.  If they'll refund you, I suppose there isn't much risk in waiting.
@_date: 2013-01-09 04:43:40
I sent a few e-mails at him, but what's the best way to go about getting a refund?
