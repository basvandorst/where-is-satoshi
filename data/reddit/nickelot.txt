As you've pointed out, the psychological impact is huge. Even if it does go up, I think this was the logical move for me, as I can only be so upset with myself missing potential gains for trying to pay off debts.
To your question: Major investments are a little complicated for me right now as I'm in a phd program and am living off of a relatively meager stipend. That being said, I do think I'll be making regular purchases of btc from now on, and if the price does drop significantly I will try and buy back as much as I can. I really do believe in this.
Edit: Also, congrats on paying off your mortgage!

Thank you!

I'm in the US. I started with 30k loans, but I have been making payments for the past few years so this lump BTC sum will be paying off what I have left, which is around 10k.
I started with a very modest investment of around 1.5 BTC and that has increased &gt;10x.
Edit: In the US, you often see a mix of loans, grants, and scholarships. It really varies widely depending on where you go. In my situation, I was given the opportunity to attend a great private school for around the same cost as a state school because of grants and scholarships. These loans were taken out through my university primarily to pay for room+board over the four years of undergrad.

Thanks! Planning on buying more in the future.

Hang in there. I feel fortunate to have had this work out. Good luck!

Congrats to you too!

Good idea. Not having to do the mental calculus of roi v interest rate is really liberating, so I'm excited to start looking at a wider variety of more traditional investments as well!

Thanks! And planning on it!
@_date: 2017-12-02 07:24:41
Thanks! It really does. :)

It does! Was just saying this in another comment but even if the price does go up, at this point I've mitigated the potential psychological impact just by paying off debts.
I didn't think I'd be able to do this for another 10 years!

This was absolutely part of it. I'm not sure if this provision is still there, but in addition to the "grad school tax" they are also removing write offs on student loan payments, so my logic was also partially driven by wanting to make this payment before the bill is enacted.

coinbase. I should be clear that I've just *sold* BTC and am waiting for the bank deposit. Once that clears I'll be paying my loan issuer. I had ~$10,000 left in debt from school after spending the past few years making minimum payments while working.

Thanks! And hang in there, man.
@_date: 2017-12-02 08:49:16
Yeah! I don't think it's fully sunk in for me yet, either. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 07:46:14
thank you!

This is a really great idea. Part of the reason the decision was difficult was because I felt I was trading my beliefs in disruption/technology for a traditionally "sensible" move. This strikes the perfect balance.

Yeah, after going through a year or two of ~$350 this just felt like the right time. The hype seems to have grown beyond this perspective at the moment.

Appreciate it. Good luck!
