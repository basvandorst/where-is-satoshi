Not possibly a scam they are a scam. I tried a test purchase and simplex said the transaction went through but changelly shows no record of the transaction.

If your're not a scam, why do you keep taking peoples money?

It took Simplex 2 weeks to actually process my purchase and then they screwed it up. They sent bitcoin to a bitcoin cash address. Now they refuse to do anything about it. They are more than likely not a scam, however they are incompetent and you shouldn't do business with them.

Yes, not paying your taxes is a crime. That was not the claim you made.

10 days this purchase has been in the wind. Stop passing the buck and accept responsibility for you companies failures.

Moron, barter is not illegal in the U.S.A. Try the new invention called google.

The problem was not simplex. The problem was my coins not being delivered. Aka fraud.

My strategy right now is a short term hold (3 years). You should also look into other cyptocurrencies.

Can I have your password to verify this claim?

Why not use a wallet as an intermediate location? Would this still be profitable after accounting for transaction fees and the unpredictable time frame of the transactions?
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:23:58
Try investing in a different crypto until the Bitcoin dam is broke. Much smaller transaction fees.
