Try to guess market share bitcoin will get on total money supply  divided by the 21 000 000 bitcoins. If we say money supply is grossly 75 trillions, divided by the 21 millions btc, gives roughly 3 575 000 / bitcoin. Lets say bitcoin gets 10% of the total money supply, that's 350K/btc . Thats just numbers, but I think it's in the realm of possible . So depending if you think in a few years if btc will be dead, 1%, 10% or 25% of total money supply.
Also depends if you think bitcoin has stronger fundementals than fiat currencies so it will increase his % of the money supply over time. Deflationnary currency w/o any central point of failure (no owner etc), easy to transfer value anywhere in the world with realtively low fees in decent time. I think it does but its anybody's guess

mining cost plus market defines the value with bid/ask, as with anything of value. What gives value to fiat money? Fact that people are willing to trade goods/services for it, same for bitcoin, but  instead of having some1 that control the supply  , no1 does for btc . Thinking that it's governement-backed gives safety to your money is kinda laughable, cause they inflate supply and havent been anywhere near trustable in many situations.

Transfering value with low fees, decentralized with no point of failure, how is that regressing ? I mean fiat system has fees too . 
Having no1 that can control the supply is a huge + also
Plus you can transfer value anywhere in a world in matter of minutes, not something you can do with current bank system. I'd say this guy is clearly a moron

Depends what you mean by fully adopted. Is there still fiat and btc remains mainly a store of value and a negligeable payment processing tool ?
A lot of improvements need to be made tech-wise if we want to see bitcoin a payment option. Faster, lower fees etc.
As an asset class you can speculate on/store of value, it's gonna take time but legitimacy is gonna come.
Good improvement in tech plus seen as legit asset/store of value, wouldnt surprise me if it hits 250K in 5 years or so

@_date: 2018-06-11 22:40:52
Dont u think if u once had 100btc, now have 20btc, that ur strategy is bad? 
Personally i rather buy dips and average down than trying to read market but thats just me
@_date: 2019-12-07 07:35:54
Yeah? Exactly what I did. Sorry I dont really understand really what it was about. It cant be harmful and I dont have to fear all my btc adresses being linked together?
@_date: 2019-12-06 23:46:36
I meant could anything negative could be done once you do it? I've claimed HEX using my btc holdings and i'm now a bit nervous
@_date: 2019-12-07 20:37:42
yeah didnt know how bad it was, if I could I would've never do it

So you're telling me a 8 trillion market (gold) is getting suppressed by a cartel? Feels wrong
