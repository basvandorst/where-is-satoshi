" A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.  "
"  What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party. "
Bitcoin white paper page 1. From Abstract and Introduction part.
Bitcoin white paper is really well written and quite eloquent even. I suggest you to read it through. its just 9 pages.

it's not because of BTC I have but the fact that I know blockchain and closely follow up with its development

I invest in BTC myself which means I also think BTC could be an asset that could outperform stuffs like gold etc. But the twit displays kind of bias. It's something like I like salmon and the guy likes it too then he just bashes the table with whole, unprepped salmon. Salmon is true. but just this is not the right way to put.

nobody knows for sure. ive always thought force from the demand side is always stronger than that from the supply side. hope the demand would match the supply.

Pro crypto myself but this reasoning is foolish I gotta say.

Volatility is risk and profit comes with risk. It's a pro for me. We think fiat currency is stable but in fact it is not. it is locally stable within the jurisdiction the currency is used but internationally the value of different currencies are supported by complex auto high frequency trading algos looking to rip from any arbitrage chance and every participant in the forex market is doing the same thing hence reducing the difference and asymmetry by great degree. For crypto to be 'stable' currency, it needs thick market, less friction and BA spread etc. far away to go. I consider BTC and other cryptos as a sort of asset not entirely cash. But we can use as a currency

i dont think these two compete. bitcoin and gold are different things. illusion comes from the perspective that is taken by profit seeking investors. from the profit perspective since both yields percentage growth it seems like these are asset classes that should be compared and one gets the better out of the other. but i disagree with such context.
