I have been pleased with campbx so far. Volume is tiny, but as a US resident it is extremely convenient to be able to use ACH to move USD out without dicking around with dwolla or other more obscure withdrawal options. Verification to increase my limits was quick and painless. I sent in a support request over the weekend asking a non-urgent question about setting up 2-factor authentication and got an answer Sunday afternoon. 
I originally signed up for it because my 2 year old Mt.Gox account was locked for inactivity (as I later found out) and I could not login nor even reset the password. Support request was eventually answered and now I can sign in, but frankly I haven't bothered using it as the queue to get verified and bring in funds is INSANE.
My referral link is  in case you would like to try it out. Aside from the referral I have no stake in campbx other than just being a satisfied user. You get a 10% lifetime discount on comissions if you use the referral link, so it isn't here solely for my own benefit.
*Edited to correct. As jocamero correctly pointed out ACH is only available for transferring USD out!

It's hard/impossible to withdraw usd from Gox. The higher price on Go. As compared to other exchanges shows the apparent difficulty factor or cost in moving them out. The easiest way seems to buy HTC and move it to another exchange and re-sell. You'll pay a few rounds of commission and some transfer fees to do this, likely around 10%...

I tried to change, ended up coming back after frustrating experiences at half a dozen other pools. What's your favorite pool? I may give it a try if I haven't already.

I don't think Gox falls under the SEC's jurisdiction. I think free market is as close as it gets. We're seeing some of that, in that the price is higher there. For now the market is just taking into consideration the difficulty (not impossibility) of getting USD out.
As a US resident, I switched from Gox to CampBX (campbx.com) some time ago. Nothing is guaranteed, but I feel that I at least have some degree of ability to hold them accountable as they are incorporated in a nearby state (Georgia). There are obviously pros and cons to using an exchange based in the US, so everyone should make their own informed decision. Its convenient that they support ACH transfers for a minimum fee and with minimum delay into my US bank account though.
Should anyone seeing this wish to give them a try, feel free to use my referral link, granting us both a slight commission discount:
Aside from being a satisfied user, I have no relation to them.

From the IRS's perspective if you buy something with it which is priced in USD do they still want to tax you on the considered value at the time of purchase as if it was a gain?
For example if I buy a $1000 tv with bitcoins which cost me $300 when I bought them, does the IRS see that as a gain of $700 or just a good deal on a tv?

The escrow service. Preferably we need a dozen who compete with each other and provide additional incentive for each to be well behaved.
One idea to start one is to have one or more respected members of the community hold a "bond" of btc to back you against fraud.

Not that I am aware of. I think I answered some questions for another guy back when this thread was new and may have more thoroughly outlined the process. If you are interested ill dig up what I sent him.

While it is certainly worth standing up for one's integrity, I would fire someone before they got done with the second paragraph of your diatribe. 
I single statement to the effect of 'I'm not making this up and will be happy to back that up if you are interested" is the appropriate response. Then just let the bullshit office politics roll off your back. 
No one likes an employee that makes others look bad. Even when they deserve it.

This is pretty much what happened to me back ~2011. Before the exchanges were popular I bought and sold bitcoin on the forums using paypal for some of the transactions. I knew exactly what the risks were, and ended up losing ~10% to fraudulent disputes. PayPal was very clear once I got a supervisor on the phone. At the time their policy was that you could use paypal for this kind of thing, but it clearly did not fall within the defined area for seller protection.
At one point paypal froze my account due to the high number of disputes related to it and it took some time to get it unfrozen. I always moved money out as soon as possible to limit how much they could take.
My paypal and eBay account were old and had a consistent string of non fraudulent transactions which is probably the only reason I ever got it unfrozen. Even then it took a lot of calls and a demand letter via certified mail. 
I even physically mailed paper invoices with printouts of the block chain transfer as a way to lend credibility to my transactions with paypal (ie yes I did send a physical item via certified mail) but it was no help in any of my disputes
In my case, the buyers mostly claimed their paypal account was hacked rather than dispute whether the bitcoin had been delivered.
Ultimately it helps to know the risks of any mechanism you are using to move value around. Be suspicious, and take steps to mitigate your risk. In my case I traded in small increments with unknown parties which saved me a lot of trouble.

Yep, the Tesla M series doesn't stack up against the ATI stuff.

Unacceptable, sure. But what leverage do users have to change the situation?

If the value of BTC increases faster than the difficulty, it could become profitable at some point.
You can play out various scenarios in the calculator
I used the "power" fields to make it instead take into account hypothetical costs for the Amazon EC2 instance by using 1000 for the "Watts used" field, the hourly cost for the EC2 instance in the "Cost per kWh" field, and zero for the "Cost of Hardware" field.
Then just fill in your hypothetical values for hash rate, difficulty, and difficulty change to run the numbers. I think its only a matter of time before private or publicly available ASIC miners raise the bar to a new level making it even more difficult to mine profitably using sub-optimal hardware.
Even today, all the hypothetical scenarios that result in even a tiny profit assume a very nice spot price for the instance. The on-demand rate is almost 7x the spot price. Today it costs $50 a day to run the instance  at on-demand pricing and the instance only mines ~3/day worth of BTC (using today's value and difficulty)

I actually didn't know about the tipping bot until your comment made me look into it. Thanks and sorry if I seemed impolite, wasn't my intention!
@_date: 2013-04-10 13:27:22
It will be totally worth it when at least one of them comes back to you with a sober look after sitting at lunch listening to his peers talk about how much them have made on bitcoin: "hey rationalappeal, do you really know how I can get some of those bitcoins?"

Good question, Who knows maybe I'll be bored again tomorrow and try out a Litecoin mining Amazon EC2 instance.
Some quick googling yields Reaper ( which claims to produce 230KH/s on an AMD GPU. A very generous assumption of 500KH/s on an EC2 GPU instance :  mining Litecoin appears as if it would produce $0.3USD/hour which is closer but still under even the spot price for the EC2 instance...
Feel free to challenge my math/assumptions if you find another source. I'm genuinely curious about all these other cryptocoins which have sprung up.

When I first joined campbx I made a couple of small sales and test withdrawals. I suggest anyone using a new exchange test the waters before bringing in more value than you can afford to lose. 
You like bitstamp? I have been considering establishing a second account just to have options. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 15:34:51
I reported them to bitpay yesterday after about 5 minutes of googling confirmed my suspicions that it was a scam.
I'm sure I wasn't the only one, but it's nice to know they care.

The question is, what is the tax basis for a bitcoin I mined? The value on the day I mined it? How the fuck do I even know? How does pool mining affect the answer?
Tax basis is what you subtract from what you sold it for to determin your profit for those who may not be familiar with US tax law. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 13:17:32
God tell them to google it if they think you made it up? What a bunch of assholes. It's not as if this is unverifiable and they just have to take your word on it. 
They probably will claim the idea as their own after they confirm it is real. 
@_date: 2013-04-07 02:03:13
Yep. Bitcoin even helps this along with the increasing difficulty level which comes even faster as the aggregate hashing power increases. 
Amazon may not raise the on demand price right away, but you can expect the spot price to rise for sure. If I had thought there was even a modest chance of it being profitable at a remotely reasonable spot price I would have done the extra 15 min of work to make my instance spawn miners automatically on startup and kept a spot order updated to launch 8 of them the moment it was profitable.
I bet a hundred people thought of this before me and actually followed through... so meh.
@_date: 2013-04-11 02:19:02
Hmm, you are totally right. Looking at my history I guess I have only used ACH to get the money out and made the assumption I could use it to move money in as well. I've edited my post to clarify!
@_date: 2013-04-10 02:28:11
I would imagine so, although I'm not a CPA.
It may get awfully complex though as I have bought and sold some, others are literally virgin and have been in my wallet since they were mined in 2010. 
My brokerage sends me a tax statement listing the basis for all of my stock sales and I'm happy to report them. But how do I do this accurately with a reasonable amount of effort for bitcoin?
Those bitcoins that I used to buy something, were those the ones I bought at $180 or at $40? Or did I mine them? Did I move them to an exchange but never trade them am move them back later?
I honestly don't think I know for most of mine, nor do the records exist. Back in 2011 I did most of my trades on exchanges that don't exist... 
I have a family and too much to lose by trying to outsmart the IRS, but even if I wanted to report, I don't think that I could. I would bet many holders of bitcoins in the low 5 figures (USD) don't have the means to report accurately either. 
What exactly is my obligation to track all this accurately? Serious question: would it be easier to just say (honestly): I estimate that I made a gain of $y and just leave it at that? Or am I better off reporting nothing so there is nothing to even raise questions on my return?
To be clear I'm not asking for tax advice on reddit, just sharing my questions. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:58:22
So why close it down now, but not when the price first started tanking?
@_date: 2013-04-07 13:58:50
Yep. The spot prices for instances are often competitive though. On demand spot price triggered mining rigs would be a neat project...

I've been pleased with Campbx. I originally signed up because my old gox account was frozen for being inactive and took quite a while to be unfrozen.
It has low volume compared to gox. I'm by no means an active day trader, but I certainly haven't had trouble getting reasonable orders filled. Moving money in requires Dwolla or USPS MO but it is convenient that they offer ACH withdrawals.
I've also had pleasant and quick response to my single question I submitted to their support regarding 2-factor authentication.
I'll shamelessly share my referral link in case anyone would like to try it out. Using the referral link gives you a lifetime 10% discount on commissions. 
I have no stake in Campbx other than being a happy customer who wants them to succeed and grow more popular.

Yep, NVIDIA just isn't optimal for BTC mining. I thought the Tesla GPUs might be better but it appears not. My results were in line with what I saw from people who tried it back in 2011.
My understanding is the NVIDIA is optimal for other scientific calculations and makes trade offs to do so. If I remember correctly something to do with number of shaders vs floating point precision. This is reddit though so if I remember incorrectly someone will correct me.

Yep, and if you google their address in London all you find are other people complaining about other scams associated with that address. It appears to be a mail forwarding company.
