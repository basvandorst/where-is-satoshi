It means just inflation which is subject to any currency which makes it worthless except bitcoins, where we know how many will be available and no more.

100% Agree with you.

I guess it depends on regulatory requirements.

Stop this FUD....
@_date: 2019-08-14 19:11:40
And if HODL and bitcoins go up then ROI even much faster. Everything depends on the situation and bitcoin price.

Electricity costs 0.05$ kWh
Return of Investment less than 150 days at current BTC price.
If you hodl as regular hodler and you mine double coins than you invested in one year and bitcoin goes to double the amount in price, then you make not just 200% profit like HODLER but 400%
Isn't it better?

And after EU’s Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD5) added into national law by January it will become even much worse.

You can buy also over the counter directly from many trusted companies with a small fee, yes but the only problem that the entry limit is high, they will not sell your 100$ or 500$ worth of bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-14 19:10:47
You are wrong because we are paying just 0.05$ kWh. At current difficulty return of investment in less than 150 days.

Sure for small trades, the fee is incomparable.
But if we talk about amounts starting from 10k then its already not so bad if the service is provided quickly without countless identity checks and limitations.
Also for example, if we receive from exchange to a local bank account here in Europe, most of the cases the funds will be suspended because of bitcoin trade.
But if you receive even large amount from over the counter trader which bank accounts are not related to a cryptocurrency exchange, then there are no questions asked from the bank at all.
@_date: 2019-08-13 20:49:09
I will not advertise it here but it is cost-effective only if you buy/sell starting from 1 BTC. They are not asking IDs and the other AML&amp;KYC stuff. Signing only formal agreement between buyer/seller and the trade is complete. For large trades can use in bank 103/72 SWIFT for both part security or even bank-issued MT199 POF to avoid scams.
@_date: 2019-08-05 10:35:44
Any proofs or screenshots?

FAKE advertisement like before just to make FUD and then use the traffic for some project opening. Bullshit.

Also the bitcoin vault is just for holding and there is no chance to transfer out bitcoins if your account has been suspended.

Binance is really under pressure right now after last week events regarding security.

@_date: 2019-08-15 13:31:25
Depends on your electricity price. We are buying at OTCFinance and electricity costs just 0.05$kWh so the return of investment is about in 6-8 months with increasing difficulty.
@_date: 2019-08-08 15:19:10
Do you think bitcoin will be the one true global currency? 
Isn't it impressive?
@_date: 2019-08-15 21:43:12
I already don't remember how to trade. Using only over the counter services for buy/sell deals. 
Of course, it will not be cost-effective for tiny amounts like 100 or 1000$ but if you want to buy/sell a larger batch of coins and do it safe recommend only Over The Counter markets.
@_date: 2019-08-13 20:12:41
Yes, because of EU Members Adopt Tougher Crypto Rules Than AML Directive Requires.
German Regulations Chase Out Crypto Companies Like Bitpay
The measures stem from the obligation of member states to transpose EU’s Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD5) into national law by January. Unfortunately, they often go beyond what Brussels wants them to do.
@_date: 2019-08-13 20:20:11
Avoid ID verifications and buy/sell bitcoins over the counter markets.
@_date: 2019-08-14 17:59:21
Not so much, but the electricity costs in our Ukraine hosting spot is just 0.05$ kWh so the return of investment is relatively fast in the current situation.
@_date: 2019-08-14 19:04:35
Preparing small delivery to bitcoinist :)

Thank you, we are going to host in Ukraine, 0.05$ kWh

Is there any information about bitmain new devices? Or still just rumors?
@_date: 2019-08-14 19:37:51
If we all stop mining because of electricity waste, then there will be no bitcoin!? Then we all have to stop supporting bitcoin and return back to FIAT only because of electricity waste?
@_date: 2019-08-14 19:08:31
We are working and delivering mostly MicroBT, StrongU, and Bitmain mining equipment.

Binance Jersey is one of four independent branches of Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume. Binance also operates exchanges in Malta, Singapore, and Uganda with Binance US set to open with the next two months according to a recent report.
Linking to his Twitter account, the hacker asked Binance CEO Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao to contact him directly.
The Twitter hacking comes almost three months after a successful hacking of Binance’s online exchange, costing the exchange over 7,000 bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-04 21:08:21
Yes, halving is little bit making to worry me. Electricity costs in Ukraine 0.05$ kWh so if we look at this point then it's fine. 
What do you say about MicroBT Whatsminer M20S [ preorder ], Bitmain Antminer S17 (56Th)and S17 pro, ASICminer 8 Nano 44Th or better select other coins?
Any opinion about Innosilicon G32-1800 GRIN miner which will be released on Oct 2019?

Just facts. Bitcoin is still a new kind of currency and everyone screams that cryptocurrencies are too volatile. But why gold was not suspended because of the volatility in the early days?
@_date: 2019-08-16 22:06:30
Already too much. Need just one for discussion.
