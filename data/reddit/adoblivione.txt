Nice strawman, but there is a reason I specified that it would be the USA adopting another currency as an alternate standard.  Since cryptos are global, the whole world becomes the country adopting two standards.  
Bitcoin's goal is to provide a true global standard currency.  Adding more alternatives in there just puts us back at square one.  The competition against Bitcoin will only cause more people to be reluctant to adopt any cryptocurrency until a "winner" is declared.

Bitcoin can be purchased with fiat currency by anyone wanting to do so.
But here we get to the root of the problem.  Litecoin supporters missed the boat on Bitcoin and are now hoping to get lucky with an alternative rather than promoting something that already works.

Just make sure you do your research before dumping your money into Litecoin.  The description here is misleading... saying that Litecoin has increased its value from $0.09 to $2.00 is true.  But saying that Litecoin increased its value from $0.09 to over $4.00 and then fell to around $2.00 and hovered around that mark is giving a more accurate picture.

Cars are not currencies.  Gold and silver are not currencies.  Period.  Stop comparing currencies to goods and commodities.  Your logic is *fatally flawed*.
If Bitcoin and Litecoin find a way to coexist peacefully, I'll learn to live with it.  But it will be a worse system for everybody than if there was one standard currency.

Why would anyone stick their neck out to support Litecoin when Bitcoin is already doing so well?  Competition between currencies is a *bad* thing for everything but speculation.

You're right, the value of Litecoin rises and falls just like any other currency.  I was refuting your statement that it does nothing but continually rise.  That's just not true.

Silver and gold don't strengthen each other.  Their values fluctuate independently of each other based on supply and demand of the commodity.
The goal is to make these coins legitimate currencies, not commodities to be bartered with.

Litecoin jumped to over $4.00 and has steadily fallen in value since then.  Your statement that Litecoin does nothing but continually rise is demonstrably false.

Again, the goal is not to strengthen cryptocurrencies as commodities.  The goal is to have them supported as legitimate currencies.  It's in the name.
Imagine if the USA adopted the Chinese Yuan as an alternate currency.  Some stores accept only dollars, some stores accept only yuan, some accept both.  What good could that possibly do anyone?
