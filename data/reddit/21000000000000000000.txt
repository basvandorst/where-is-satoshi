If everyone started using segwit addresses only, I think we could get another 6 months to a year out of the current network as-is. But after that we need some legit scaling roadmap, including an honest discussion about a 2MB block size. If Satoshi had started with 2MB blocks it would be canon and no one would have a problem with it. 
I'm hopeful but not holding my breath that the lightning network is as groundbreaking as expected. It's also a new piece of technology and I won't be surprised if there are hacks/exploits found that result in loss of funds. I personally won't be moving my funds out of cold storage until it has been field tested for at least a year.
Over the next 18 months I expect money to flow from BTC to BCH and equalize a bit. That will have 2 effects: It will alleviate stress on the BTC network, lowering fees, and fees will start creeping up on the BCH network, highlighting that block size increases alone won't be a viable long-term solution.

@_date: 2017-12-20 15:15:32
Both. it's less centralized and it's a stop-gap solution. I don't have a problem with stop-gap solutions as minuscule as a 2MB block for the time being. But the common response is "We already have 2MB blocks if everyone would just use segwit". 
Well ok great but that's not realistic because very few exchanges and wallets support segwit yet. And with segwit and a 2MB block we'd really have 4MB blocks then. Even better in terms of network capacity. 
I was/am opposed to the segwit2x execution because it had shit dev talent and was rushed. I think many people in this sub would be fine with a 2MB block size if core threw their support behind it, but it's not a trivial change.

This is a good question to be asking but I believe the answer is "nobody but coinbase knows". MtGox was in a similar position and the answer for a long time was clearly "Nope".
If you buy "instantly" via credit card, you'll see how your balance of coins increases, well, instantly. This is fundamentally impossible if it were a true blockchain event, so the only explanation is that they are simply moving assigned coin amounts around on their internal systems. This by itself is not necessarily anything to worry about, however.
Beyond the issue of an audit of their coins, I sometimes worry about their liquidity. If you have purchased via a ACH bank xfer, you'll notice that when you make such a purchase the price is locked in and then you get your coins when the money is transferred. There are 2 explanations for this that I can think of:
1) They buy coins for you up front at the locked-in price and then reimburse themselves when your money comes through
2) They wait for the money to come through and then buy the coins at market price. 
It all comes down to trust, which is ironic, but as others have pointed out, if you don't know your private keys, you don't own any bitcoin. All you have from coinbase is an IOU. 
This was a lot scarier when things were less regulated, but I still only keep a little on coinbase and move chunks to paper wallets when I want to add to my cold storage.

Most people can't balance a checkbook and although I'm bullish on BTC I do worry about adoption. The average person is just way too stupid to manage things like private keys. We can't even manage passwords.
The problem with this is that eventually I fear it means people end up just trusting a third party to manage it, like some bitcoin bank, denominated in satoshis maybe, and fdic insured perhaps. But to think that the world is going to move to a trustless model where you are one fat fingered mistake away from exposing a QR code that let's someone drain your net worth in a millisecond is ridiculous. 
The notion that ownership in the bitcoin model is based on knowledge and not assignment like in the current system is not only a mindfuck for most people, but incredibly scary when you start talking about putting your entire life's savings into what is essentially a random number that you hope no one ever discovers. 
blockchain based money is the future, but it's going to be just absolutely layered with regulations and APIs so that the average person interacts with it the same way they do PayPal and Venmo.

jfc people,
The amount of energy CONSUMED by bitcoin currently, and the amount of energy NEEDED TO RUN bitcoin at any moment are not the same thing.
Bitcoin consumes X amount of energy because people find it profitable, it heats their home maybe, etc. But it's not NEEDED to actually make bitcoin function at all.

Depends on how you generate a private key. You can't prove a negative so I can't prove that the government secretly doesn't have a backdoor in the Nano. I can't prove that the Nano has a bug that sometimes exposes the private keys in some way as to be steal-able by a third party, etc. Did you know that you can sometimes determine what a CPU is doing by the *sounds* it makes as electricity flows through it? I'm not talking about real-world security btw, but theoretical security. Maybe the nano has such side-channel attacks we just don't know about yet. 
Secure private key generation hinges on a simple question: Are you the only human who has ever seen it? How do you know the Nano doesn't just hand out private keys from a pool they pre-generated and in 5 years they wipe everyone's balance and disappear?
Every third party you introduce into the holding of your keys is a security risk.

That too. I personally don't believe in true 100% randomness but for the purposes of this task, flipping a fair coin 256 times and using the sides as bits and running that through software you personally wrote to generate bitcoin keys and addresses from on an airgapped computer is about as safe as I can think.
And incredibly unrealistic for 99% of the people here.

**HOLY SHIT**
**I FOUND IT!!!!!!**
SCAN THE QR CODE OF THIS IMAGE:
(this image is one of the first google image search results for "electrum seed")
The QR code is the 12 word mnemomic that was used to generate this private key. (see OP's edit5)
OP, is this your photo? Did you not realize that redacting the text but leaving the QR code essentially exposed this key? If this image is not yours, how the hell do you have the exact same menomic?!
edit: So given all of the information up to this point I only see 2 possibilities:
1) This is the strangest malware ever
2) There was a bug with electrum that caused it to re-use the same seed that just so happened to be also exposed online in google images... jfc I can't even fathom how unlucky this is if it's the case.
@_date: 2017-09-25 19:02:26
To elaborate -- a paper wallet is the only trustless method of storing bitcoins. Hardware wallets are very safe, but they are provably not as safe because PRNGs are not "as-random" as true randomness. And, you are trusting the manufacturer of hardware wallets to not have any backdoors, and to have implemented all their crypto properly.
This is not a trivial task. Poorly implemented crypto has meant there were bitcoin addresses that could be REVERSED TO THEIR PRIVATE KEY based on the publicly available signatures. 
Look, the bottom line is this: To understand bitcoin fully means understanding what you are really doing: You are hiding money in a number between 1 and 1,461,501,637,330,902,918,203,684,832,716,283,019,655,932,542,976
It's secretly, randomly, trustlessly picking a number in that range that is the hard part, as trivial as it may seem. 
What I did for the most secure BTC storage: implemented my own library in python that converts between various forms of private keys and generates compressed/uncompressed/segwit addresses. Then I flip a coin 256 times (yeah it gets compressed from 2^256 to 2^160 but thats a technical aside) and use those H/T as the bits. I run the bitstring through my software (offline computer that I wipe before and after) and now I have a bitcoin address that I can safely send money to.

3) If I run core is that it or do I need to open my firewall to allow outside connections and port forward to my node?
4) What will happen if the HF happens? Will bitcore stop being a block-explorer for the legacy chain and only be for the BTC2x chain??
SO MANY THINGS GOING ON.
@_date: 2017-09-27 22:29:55
My understanding is if you make your first post-fork transaction on the legacy chain a transaction from yourself TO YOURSELF (different address you control) to an address not used on the forked chain then....

When people say private key they mean the number between 1 and 2^256 that gives you the ability to sign transactions on a given bitcoin address.
Your 24 word seed is a proxy for that number, and numbers deterministically associated with it, that together make up your "wallet".


I don't have a hardware wallet so correct me if I am wrong but no -- if someone knows your 24 words, they own all your bitcoin too.

I've gone through all of the google images looking for exposed keys such as this. Then it's just a matter of importing them into electrum and exporting them, and then finally re-importing them into a rainbow table.
But because rainbow tables are built mostly by pre-computing hashes from dictionary words, when I saw that I had this key I assumed that he was hacked that way, from a compromised brain wallet. 
I knew that mnemomic looked familiar!

So like bitcoin, the organization, as a trusted central authority, could print these pieces of paper called bitpapers and then instead of using the network to confirm transactions we would just trade these bitpapers for goods and services? And maybe for a while, just to start, the bitpapers could be backed by the actual bitcoin in the ledger?

Bottom line is: You are too late to make "large sums" of money. If you want to LEARN about bitcoin I would recommend this: Take whatever money you can afford to lose and buy that much in bitcoin. Practice sending transactions between wallets you own. Practice making a paper wallet in a safe manner. Practice sweeping paper wallets. Learn about the size of the vast bitcoin keyspace and convince yourself why it works and why having a truly random private key is so crucial. If you're a coder, implement a library of code that generates keys and addresses and such. Get a coin, flip it 256 times and figure out how to translate that into a private key.
There is no way to get rich quickly with bitcoin right now, especially with the average capitalization of a teenager, unless you are willing to do illegal things.
You're a teenager. You should be opening a ROTH IRA and dumping your money into VTSAX if you're looking to invest it.
Learning about bitcoin will give you a new skill that will be important in the coming years. It won't make you rich overnight. In 1994 you should have been learning about how the internet works, TCP/IP, HTML, etc. Not trying to invest in pets.com.

Still trying to figure out how I got this key -- I have been building a rainbow table for a while. It looks like this key was from an old dump of electrum priv keys I did into my table. My hypotheses right now are that the keys were in a file indexed by google (lots of wallets available that way), or it was indeed from an old word list but given where this key falls in my rainbow table I would have expected a collision when adding it...
For the proof: I have signed the message "sorry about your coins hacked123456" for address 1GzYFnuZKf8KwfWcvvonwxcbLuSobfV11G:

Does your "private key" start with a 5 or a K or and L? If so, run the website from bitaddress.org on an OFFLINE computer (so download the source code and run the html page in a browser on an offline computer)
See if the bitcoin addresses it generates are the same as what you posted above. If so, I'd say your outta luck. If it's a new address with a balance, then you can access those funds.

If you're going to use a hotwallet it needs to be something similar to the security level of using electrum in a TAILS live ISO. Stop using Windows and stop using your everyday browser for these types of transactions. You know how people say "use a dedicated browser for online banking". That advice should be shouted 100x louder for bitcoin work in the browser.
Anything less than that and you're playing with fire.

@_date: 2017-10-22 19:09:12
Sounds like maybe 2FA backup codes to me. I'm still confused as to why you think you had 3 BTC. I still can't see how you ever had more than .999
And its very strange -- the .999 was moved to the 1Gznet address in 2 blocks, and in the first transaction of .75 BTC, the change was returned BACK to the same 1NFi address. Note that this happened only 14 minutes after you apparently made/moved funds to the paper wallet. 
So another question is ok, how/where did you generate this paper wallet? What steps did you take to ensure its private key was safe?
@_date: 2017-10-04 05:46:05
Confirmed! Wow what the hell. That makes 4 of us that have this private key. Alister, any idea where you came across it?
@_date: 2017-10-05 16:08:06
Alright I'll stop being a dick and do some teaching:
Wallets =/= addresses, they are *collections* of addresses that you have control over. This means your BTC, or more accurately, unspent transaction outputs (utxo's) are likely spread across multiple addresses. Why? Because most wallets use a NEW address for each incoming transaction, and a NEW address for change EACH TIME. 
When you go and look up an address like yours at 
you are looking at just 1 of those addresses. and it happens to be one that has had no funds going either in or out. This makes sense, because breadwallet likely generates a new address every time someone sends you money, and this address is simply "next up" in the queue. 
This address would be one that someone who solved the puzzle would gain access to, but it alone does not prove anything about the funds in any *other* addresses associated with the wallet. 
@_date: 2017-10-07 02:40:09
Lets say you have a paper wallet that is composed of just 1 UTXO. Am I correct in saying that step 1 is already done, but for step two you would want to IMPORT that paper wallet into something like electrum instead of sweeping it? Because the act of sweeping the paper wallet itself would be a replay-able transaction?

what was the bitcoin address of the paper wallet where the funds were?
@_date: 2017-10-08 20:30:27
I don't think thats quite right -- it's a little more nuanced:
It would be good if someone confirmed this -- my understanding is that you should get coins into a single UTXO before the fork. 
Then you need to send a very tiny amount of that UTXO to the 3Bit address after the fork. This makes the returned coins safe from replay attack. To send that transaction though, I feel like you would import your private key rather than sweep. because sweeping is itself a replayable action? 
Once that is finished, replay safe coins on the main chain are at the change address and the segwit2x coins are at the old paper wallet address?
Can anyone confirm?
@_date: 2017-10-03 22:09:38

Thank you! I'm still wracking my brain over how I have this key but I have to say (and this could just be wishful thinking) that I feel like I have seen this mnemonic before. Last night I considered 3 ways I might have found this key:
1) Generated from a dictionary word -- seems unlikely after working on this last night. I could have generated it from some "hex" dictionary words. Still looking into that.
2) Your wallet.dat/default_wallet file was somehow leaked on the internet and indexed. Just a simple search of open directories and open FTP sites reveals at least a half dozen such files. I have confirmed this key is not in any of those that I found.
3) This 12 word seed has been leaked online somewhere and some hacker added it to their bot. I haven't explored this angle yet. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 16:38:58
You are probably looking at 2 addresses that come from the same public key, but in different formats. 
1 private key / public key pair can generate the following:
bitcoin address from the full public key
bitcoin address from the compressed public key
segwit bitcoin address
I'm not 100% sure, but I assume the equivalent hash160 means that the addresses were generated from the same private key?
