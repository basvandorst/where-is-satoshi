I remember when it was climbing to 20k FAST, my brother suggested I buy some coin. The process to so long that by the time the transaction went through, the value went down about half of what I initially spent, and I haven't broken even a dollar profit since. Of course, HODL, but damn it if I wasn't at least a tiny bit disappointed

This is really good advice. Boring ass American kids too lazy to do anything themselves will pay ridiculous amounts of mommy's money for someone else to grind for them. 
My uncle and I used to bot dozens of accounts and then sold them and made a bunch of money both in game and irl. I had a cousin who was the exact type of lazy ass customers we would target, and he most definitely did buy his in game items with real money like a fool.

God damn talk about that FOMO huh?
My older brother convinced me to finally bite the bullet. He had been making serious gains with ETH and BTC so I followed suit and sunk.in a few hundred bones. That next week my BTC cleared and the value has dropped ever since
