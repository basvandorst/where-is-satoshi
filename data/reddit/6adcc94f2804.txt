It could be...
* An upgraded version of Reddit Gold, offered via an ICO held by Reddit. Every single post, vote, etc you've made on Reddit would be included in the Reddit blockchain, and you'll get the Gold if you managed to create the first record on a newly-generated block. Its Proof-of-Work is supported by a computational-intensive process known as shitposting.
* Reddit Gold purchased via Bitcoin.

This is NOT the signature he used by the time he posted it to BitcoinTalk, but a updated, current one.
Want to find historical information? First, do a Google search to reveal the original URL of this post,  we'd clearly find out that the information shown in the screenshot is the updated online version. So, go to archive.org, type the URL we've just found out (change https:// to http:// since archive.org still doesn't recognize HTTPS addresses), get the archived version from February 9, 2014 at 
You'll find his original signature was






Look at the address at blockchain.info:  we can see 4.08176 BTC in total was received, nine transactions, which the last one was made in 2014 (did he HODL?). In addition, he also received 12,621,333 DOGE in total, which is equivalent to 84,562 USD in today's price (but did he HODL?), as shown here, 
To AltCrow, fmlthrowaway48 and everyone who has been fooled by the screenshot, you really need to improve your common sense and skill to gather information from the Internet.
I'm done. Feel free to dig further and do some additional blockchain analysis, anyone?

This is called a trilemma.

**Secrecy** != **Anonymity**
Everyone is posting over an encryption connection, http**s**://reddit.com. But encryption doesn't prevent anyone from identifying you, for example through your IP address, *e.g. I brought a sealed package to the post office at 2pm, then the post office just blew up 5 minutes later, but nobody ever knew what was in my package!*
A brand new account over Tor connection is the only practical solution.
Even so, it's **Pseudonymity**, not **Anonymity**, as you still have a unique Reddit account. Anonymity requires the impossibility to distinguish anyone from a given list of all participants.
It's off-topic, but since pseudonymity is one of the core features of Bitcoin, and I'm from r/Cyberpunk, I think it would better clarifying it to help more Bitcoin users.

perhaps they were just moving their semi-cold wallets?

I'd rather have some ~~Hash~~ hashrate, thx.

First, as a public service - after all, if no one is mining on testnet, testnet won't be able to process any transactions, and no tests can be done! Also to get your own coins for testing.

No offense.
But is there any reason to use this tool at all, when we already have [Diceware]( from ~1995, the Cypherpunk-era, as a famed, proven solution in the first place? It's easy to generate a 128-bit secure passphrase by hand using a dice as TRNG in Diceware, and uses it to derive a wallet. Actually, [BIP-0039]( is based on this very idea.
While I agree using a coin instead of a dice is pretty useful in your scheme.

Of course it's non-euclidean geometry, but it's hard to believe a claim, in r/Bitcoin, says parallel lines intersect at infinity gets such amount of downvotes! It's r/Bitcoin, but still nobody gets the joke, unbelievable! What's wrong with these Bitcoiners nowadays, are they just coming for a Make-Money-Fast scheme!?
In projective geometry, parallel lines indeed do intersect at [point at infinity]( Does it have anything to do with Bitcoin? Bitcoin uses Elliptic Curve Cryptography, and Elliptic Curve Cryptography is built upon some fundamental concepts from projective geometry, including point at infinity.
Read [some basic tutorial]( to grasp the basis here, all your Bitcoins in your wallet literally depend on the (non-euclidean geometry) assumption that two parallel lines do intersect at infinity to exist. [OpenSSL Wiki]( also makes a good explanation.
Those who downvoted the parent comment are damned to have not-working Elliptic Curve Cryptography and lost all the Bitcoins in their wallet.
