By that logic when you tell anyone about any investment you can expect to be held accountable. Because what you just described is them discounting everything they were told and holding you responsible regardless. I don't see how "don't invest more than you can lose" protects against someone prepared to do that.
You would say "i said not to invest more than you can lose", I would say "I never told you to invest". My position is massively stronger. I've said it multiple times now, you're literally telling them how to invest, that's massively more responsible.
Edit: "You told me not to invest more than I'm willing to lose, I did that and I lost. So your advice didn't pan out. You owe me."
"I rushed into it, I should have done more research like you told me to."
Come on, it's obvious which is the better option :-).

This is a literal walk in the park in comparison to things like, I don't know, Mike Hearn made a giant shitpost that Bitcoin was dead and the price dropped 25% in like an hour. Mike Hearn was a lead developer at one point and one of the few people who actually spoke directly with Satoshi when Bitcoin it was first created. 
Go have a look at the second time we broke 1k on the 4hr chart. It was fucking mental. The thought of a 2000USD Bitcoin just a couple of years ago is like the thoughts of a 70k Bitcoin today - enough to get you flamed.

I make it extremely clear that it's no walk in the park, but if I didn't do this, I can see how it could be perceived as some kind of sales pitch. I just never go as far as to specify their parameters of investment, it's none of my business. That's the point I was making initially.

*“A general belief seems to prevail in the Colony that the Indians are little better, if at all, than savages or the Natives of Africa. Even the children are taught to believe in that manner, with the result that the Indian is being dragged down to the position of a raw Kaffir.”*
-Mahatma Gandhi
   &gt; 1.
    &gt;offensive
    &gt;an insulting term for a black African.
Ghandi was extremely racist against Black people. He once complained that Europeans were using Black and Indian children as target practice with their guns - his objection was that it wasn't just the black children being shot and by shooting both it makes the Indians look as low as the Blacks.
Oct. 17, 1896
“A picnic party of European children used Indian and Kaffir boys as targets and shot bullets into their faces, **hurting several inoffensive children** (he means non-blacks). So deep-seated is the hatred that children have begun instinctively to look down upon Indians.” ~ Vol. I, p. 421

Propaganda to steal from the population. Like how they stole the gold from their population. How they discontinued certain denominations of cash without a care for those affected.
The Indian Government are just finding new ways to scam their own population. The worst part is all the population are so trusting they actually believe what they hear from their Government they are willingly getting cheated out of their money. Bizarre.

@_date: 2018-10-21 15:51:26
Have to admit I feel vindicated, because I was saying this was going to happen well over a year ago and was insulted even on this forum.
The next stage is the normal institutions enter, but the normies won't be told what's happening or will be encouraged to stay out. Once all the institutions have taken their positions the every day people will be encouraged to buy in and at the top the hedge funds will begin to sell into them. Logically the ETF should come after this too (after the normal institutions enter), which means between now and Q2 2019 we will see a massive bullrun. From there the price will be held similar to gold.
I have no idea how high the price will be at this point, could be 50k, could be 500k.

In that case I've been doing the talk wrongly. I tell them about how I was an early investor and hit big and that they will too if they get can in at the right time. I'm not lying to them nor telling them what to do. What they do from there is entirely their choice.
If someone talks about a new stock and the frames it with but do not invest more than you can lose, it makes everything said prior look like a joke. If even the advocate thinks it will go to nothing it must be a pile of shit.
That's why it's so obviously idiotic to say it. It's up to the individual to determine how *they* decide to invest based on *their own* thoughts for the investment's future - they don't need such advice, unless you're talking to a child.

The global internet speeds are constantly speeding up, there is no way that a block-size under 8mb is affected by this. You must surely appreciate this?


This is so wrong. The nodes which are actively participating in the broader network are run by miners and exchanges, no exchange is going to shut down because they need more storage - that's completely unrealistic.
If someone is running a *hobby* node, to validate for their *own* transactions. They're already regularly buying new HDD's if they aren't pruning. If they decide not to validate their own transactions its no loss to the network. If you turn off your Email server that serves only you is it a loss to the internet?
No, the only real reason not to increase blocksize is mining centralization. That's the real risk to the Network. But if your post is true, its not really an issue anymore.
But I disagree, irrespective of Moores law hardware is still improving and now there are patents protecting advantages. So the premise of your post is inaccurate and so was Antonopoulos. So our discussion is pointless anyway.

This response is more geared to what I was saying. But look, there are proposals to make Bitcoin more efficient like Schnorr Signatures which are admittedly more than a year away.
So if they're talked about already why is blocksize not allowed to be spoken about now? 
If Bitcoin became 50,000USD tomorrow, how would you open Lightning Channels to do Micro payments? The fee would be like 100USD. How can Lightning work in that environment?
This means that until lightning is fully operational and fully on-boarded that Bitcoin's price cannot go above a certain amount if it is to be used for any thing payment related (average sized purchased). Do you get my point? Not talking about it is dumb, not planning is dumb. The community is forbidding itself from talking about it.

You're 100% correct, people won't believe it until they see it because there is a feeling of hopelessness. But as soon as the market changes direction it's highly likely sentiment will go the other way very quickly and become confidently bullish.
These cycles are visible throughout Bitcoin's "life", it's not like it would be the first or even 4th time we've seen this same type of thing.
If price hasn't reversed and started gaining by mid-december, then worrying would be justified. But right now, feeling great.

This is a common misconception. The "Over the counter" trade *can* be directly with a private individual, but my experience is that it never is in Bitcoin. The OTC just means you don't have to manage the trades yourself and they are better at this than you i.e they get you more money for the Bitcoins and don't accidentally market sell the lot. The liquidity provider is just a group of publicly trading exchanges that the OTC commonly works with and buys and sells *directly* and *immediately* affect the price globally.
The real question behind this thread is if BAKT will pump the price, the answer is almost certainly a resounding YES. It's impossible for it not to. Which makes it hilarious that there are sells on the order book from normal people right now, they're being played.

That's when you realized? What are they putting in the water over there? Oh yeh, flouride, my mistake. It's working.

Thanks for the insight. How would I gain access to a mailing list to be able to discuss this, or at least see what others are discussing in terms of progress? It's a little embarrassing after all these years of being involved I don't know this.

When everyone's making money, what's money between friends? When everyone's losing money every unaccounted penny is them trying to cheat you.
We're all the same, really, lol.

*Now* you need staff lol. Beautiful though.
@_date: 2018-10-17 08:35:30


No there won't. Srs.
@_date: 2018-10-18 13:04:46
Then the reward halves. Yeh, not getting involved.

Yes, I have. The marketing campaigns stopped about 3 weeks ago. Up to that point there was relentless bullshit in this sub which was painfully obviously trying to take the market sentiment down.
Now that BAKT etc are coming the FOMO posts will begin. Enjoy to all who held, you earned it. To those who sold, pussy.

Of all the photos I'd want of me on the internet....
@_date: 2018-10-25 16:19:32
It's basically empty :(
@_date: 2018-10-29 14:28:25
lol. I did the maths on it and realized what I just told everyone on the internet.

Martin Luther King obviously didn't know he hated blacks...

Maybe you are?

Hi guys, can you make one which fits multiple Seeds into it? Like a 2 or 3 wallet version?
I don't want to have to buy and manage the location of multiple and I don't want to keep my seeds in their actual order. I hope no one does.
@_date: 2018-10-17 07:44:23
I was just playing around with that bit really. Unless you admitted it. Then I meant it.
@_date: 2018-10-30 08:20:15
If that's true then the argument against larger blocksizes (mining centralization) completely fall through. The whole principle of larger blocksizes centralizing mining comes from the fact that there are technological advantages certain miners have over others. So if they all end up with similar Tech, as your post implies, there is no reason not to increase the blocksize anymore....

Nice one

You fuck!!! You actually called it!

Angry 12 year old over here, lets not upset him.

Except that they don't.

I'm not hinting at the moderation, I've never been banned from here talking about anything here. I know why that is, its because I'm sincere.
However, even when I present original and pertinent points I get people talking absolute nonsense at me. I'm shocked that I have received a coherent response from yourself - not insulting you personally just because I expected insults.
I guess what I take away from your post that that I shouldn't expect r/bitcoin to be the place to engage too seriously on too complicated a topic. Again, not as an insult to this sub but because there are /have been too many trolls insincerely discussing this.
@_date: 2018-10-17 07:24:48
"As an alternative to actually receiving their  USD"
@_date: 2018-10-25 04:30:46
LOL you're clueless.

Erik? Vitalik?
Are you kidding? ROGER VER.

My best friend was from India....I know :-)
@_date: 2018-10-16 13:25:48
Did you just become *best friends*? Time to make bunk beds. There'll be more space this way for you to practice karate.
@_date: 2018-10-29 06:33:23
You're right, but Ver is the scammiest fuck I have ever seen in my life.

Their assessment/perceptive ability isn't so credible since they thought they could use known GRU agents to poison someone in the UK, claim the guys were tourists, put them on TV claiming it personally, and get away with it. 
Bitcoin is "fading away", meanwhile Malta tells the UN its the future of finance. BAKKT around the corner, Fidelity around the corner, Goldman joining the ranks, 1 in 5 new hedge funds is for Crypto.....Russia you just did it again.
