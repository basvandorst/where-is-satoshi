I agree, bitfinex is just one o a long line of hacks. Security is a relative game. The more one is invested in hacking you, the more chance they have, and with bitcoin the incentive is huge.
Centralized exchanges are a fundamental security issue, we need to find solutions.
@_date: 2016-08-06 04:00:02
It's much more then bad security.
Exchanges are honeypots, and given the incentive it becomes clear that somebody will find a way to get to the hot wallets.
If bitcoin is to survive we need to find a solution
@_date: 2016-04-23 05:19:49
Well, we all would, but consider the limitations.
The bitcoin blockchain is transparent, meaning you expose data and metadata (meta can't be encrypted on bitcoin blockchain). Also costs and speed may be an issue. More then that? You can costume it to fit you perfectly. All you give in return is a security advantage.
If you can make it 'secure enough' won't you go for private blockchain?

Like the way the report ends: "The application of decentralised technology to this platform of digital information could have far-reaching implications, other industries whose products were digitised have been reshaped by new technology. The impact of the distributed ledger on the financial industry could be much wider than payments."

The only way Chinise overcome capital control is by mining bitcoins, the exchange does not effect that, it just spreads it around.

In the case of bitcoin i can see this etf more akin to an ipo.
The bitcoin exchanges cannot handle an order of magnitude higher trade. I think this platform has been pushed to it's limits and it is imperative to have an etf.
Yet, we have to consider the how of the transition period.
I do believe the time is now, if we wait the transition problem might grow.

You neglect the fact that bitcoins produced in Greece are produced with local electricity, paid with local currency within the existing financial 'boundary.' They are impervious to sanctions and financial controls since they can be sold face to face.
If you produce bitcoins in china there is a need for capital to be converted and sent to cover the cost and a market to facilitate the exchange.
@_date: 2015-07-11 20:55:00

Like the title... Sound a little like 'Dr. Strangelove: how I learned to stop worrying and love the bomb'
It is not clear enough to people talking about bitcoin that the 'Coin' is part of the 'Blockchain'. There is a very delicate 'checks and balances' system working on in the protocol that uses game theory to allow bitcoin to remain truly p2p and decentralized. The fact that the token in the system is the reward that the miners get ties it all together.
People talking about 'Blockchain' without a 'coin' are merely speaking of digital signatures as a structure... A very interesting tech, but nothing that 'new'.

I am writing from bitcoin embassy in tel aviv. We had the privilege to see Nadav build this system, and we enjoy seeing the result.
