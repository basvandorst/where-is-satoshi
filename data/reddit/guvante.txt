No the current implementation leans that way, but there is nothing fundamental to stop regulation.
Additionally it certainly wasn't attempting to allow unregulated exchanges to exist.

To be fair, most of the people fighting against online sales tax are doing it due to the complexity of handling it. Amazon has enough revenue to not have to worry about it, they would probably do it voluntarily if it didn't give them a competitive disadvantage to do so.

Or it could be that they way banking regulations work you are either in compliance or not. If you are not in compliance all of your business partners could potentially be brought out of compliance by working with you.
So as a business they need to decide if the impact on their partners is minor enough to be okay with it.

If you mop the floor and fail to put up a wet floor sign and someone trips, they could potentially sue your store for $200,000 or more.

That is actually fairly hard to do, and may become impossible depending on where fees go and how good of algorithms are developed to untangle laundering rings.


I would bet that a lot of regular users have become accustomed to the wide range of products that can be purchased. Those shops live off the exchanges. Losing the stores is what I am saying will be bad for Bitcoin, not the exchanges themselves.
@_date: 2013-04-20 00:18:48
If you say so, you say that to not personally reimburse $100,000+ of other people's money is criminal, I say that is a silly thought.
Could you have done the same? Would you consider yourself a criminal if you failed to pay up because you didn't have the money?
Hiding behind "its my opinion" is done too often, so I tend to ignore that line. The point you were trying to make is what is being discussed. When talking in person not remembering the ability to have opinions leads to people being steamrolled, not much of a problem on an internet forum where neither party will discuss again after at most 4 posts back and forth.

Who do you buy it from? There are hundreds of stores that accept bitcoin, but name 5 that don't convert the majority into Fiat on sale. (Except companies selling mining hardware, since they would be much more willing to ride the currency)
Bitcoins can be used to buy things because they have liquidity right now, without that the current huge number of uses for it would disappear. Sure there are a couple of communities out there that might keep it, but very few places that accept bitcoin actually want bitcoin, they are just redefining their price in a different currency.

Most of the hate on credit card companies is caused by people using them irresponsibly. And like most financial institutions they tend to stick to their guns on penalties.
But being able to swipe a card to give money and have basically no risk of illegitimate loss is pretty awesome.
Similarly the lack of chargebacks is awesome for stores, but bad for consumers.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:43:57
As long as the difference is within 5% it should be fine, but if you lose 10% or more you just cause a scare and everyone jumps off, making the fee go even higher and reducing peoples faith in the system severely.

I don't think people are hating on Bitcoins, they are hating on the speculative commodity nature of them at the moment.
I don't have anything against Gold, but I think the silly price spike caused by speculation (The dollar is going to end soon) made me unlikely to invest in it.

Nothing you said disagrees with what I said.
If it wouldn't hurt sales Amazon would collect sales tax, because it would get the state governments off their back. But of course it will affect sales so they were working against it. I didn't mention why they are for it now, but that is a pretty obvious eventuality of why people are working against it (and why I mentioned that same problem doesn't plague them).


Again you aren't disagreeing with me, just putting a negative spin on the situation. Whether it is necessary for everyone to collect sales tax is a debatable point and Amazon is correct in saying it would be more fair from their perspective if everyone had to charge the same amount.
@_date: 2013-04-17 20:15:10
Amazon isn't interested in a currency that where they can only guarantee a price for 15 minutes.

Bitcoin is in a dilemma, private keys were never designed to be handled by humans, so the protocol was designed with wallets that would handle that complexity for you.
Similarly the default client does this as well.
Technically the protocol allows you to send the change to wherever you want, including the original. When using a wallet there is no benefit (and there are slight security issues with) using the same private key again.

But loans aren't paid in full, you could have 42 million worth of loans and have them all paid back eventually, it would just take time for the coins to circulate.

They have already said they are taking actions to avoid hitting 51%. They currently sit well below 40% total hashing power, but if they get to that they will be "sanctioning" people to encourage them to move on their own. Including locking out new members in certain conditions.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:05:59
I was talking about being able to do the BTC -&gt; USD conversion in a distributed fashion without requiring access to the Fiat currency that second. Ripple is an example of that (although it introduces another "currency" that doesn't solve my second point).
Say you had a P2P system that allowed virtual dollars. You could go to a gateway, give them real dollars and get virtual dollars (probably with a fee) you could then trade those virtual dollars for other things in a P2P fashion. Then when someone wanted to cash out, they could take their virtual currency to a gateway, pay a fee, and get real dollars out.
Ideally this would allow virtual dollars to be pinned to real dollars in some way, but again I wouldn't know how to do that.

You have now switched gears. I am not trying to say that fractional reserve banking is good (although I believe that, I did not mean to argue that point). I am simply saying that it is completely possible.

Bullshit, don't speak anecdotes are reality. Stolen credit cards are incredibly common.
I would agree that it happens, but it isn't the primary function.


But here is your problem, how do you convince people who currently use credit cards to use it? I never use cash, I just use a credit card everywhere. What point would there be to use an alternative that provides fewer protections?
I am not saying you have to convince me, just reminding you that missing features are missing features. **Especially** in today's world of relatively frequent viruses going around.

You have to do a ton of transactions to get a digital sale for less than 60 cents.
And assuming that the fee when BTC is $120 will be the same as the fee when BTC is $12,000 is a bit of a simplistic viewpoint.
@_date: 2013-05-10 15:37:51


Actually no, they lose boatloads of money if you default. At 27% interest rate calculated monthly and a 2% minimum payment you will pay them $1,214 and owe $5,114. If you now decide to stop making payments and they only wait 3 months to send you to collections they would probably get $1,339 or 25%.
At this point they loaned you $5,000 and got half of it back 15 months later.
Now if you have someone who sits on a balance for 2 years before paying it off you are right, they make good money off that, but don't think that collections is a magical fairy to fix their issues.


Except you provide zero evidence for this, since you don't mention anywhere where you need to use the credit, just where it is available.
@_date: 2013-05-21 22:02:39
Are we talking about Bitcoin as a currency, or as a commodity?
As a currency the entire value lies in how much it is traded. Currently $50 million a day, or thereabouts from what I have heard. If conversions to and from USD stopped, I would estimate more like $100 thousand. That would spike the value of the currency by about a factor of 22 (SQRT of 500), bringing to to $7.
As a commodity its value is based on what it can be exchanged for. Similarly the inability to exchange into fiat is very painful, as that means almost all of the current stores that accept it will stop, so the ability to get anything with it will be greatly diminished.
@_date: 2013-04-19 22:55:44
Doesn't matter, that is asymptotic to the fact that inflation is good (except its impact on interest).

Most who complain about fees that low don't understand the costs involved in handling money. Cash is actually fairly expensive to handle when you consider time involved.
Now the complaint about sometimes charging 5% is valid, since others are charging less.

Nothing, only one piece of work per 10 minutes becomes something useful (a new block) the remainder is useless.


If you want to call it that. Nothing.
Basically you are just doing what is called a proof of work. "I tried really hard to find this". However it is really easy to verify the work. This is most easily done when the result of the work is unimportant, just that you can verify the work.

Bitcoin is currently doing what, $50 million a day in fiat transfers? Do you know what going from that level of liquidity to $100,000 would look like?


And electronically transferring currency from any of those nations into USD (or most other NATO currencies) is very difficult.
Remember bitcoins is doing well due to its liquidity, if that disappears bad things will happen.
@_date: 2013-04-18 23:20:44

The entire reason the currency is getting light is the ability to transfer between Fiat. If countries wanted to they could stop any organized attempt to convert between Bitcoin and their fiat.
Sure Bitcoin could survive since the underlying protocol still works without a fiat conversion, but would anyone care about it at that point?

You are assuming a positive net worth. If you have a negative net worth than your debt becomes cheaper with inflation.
And you can't make any assumptions with a outflow rate of always 100%. If that is your baseline assumption than analysis can't do you any good, since the only possible outcome is "they spend all their money".

I think the biggest issue with a P2P exchange will be liquidity. How do you ensure you have enough gateways to avoid anyone getting locked out.
Also avoiding the problem of "I got $100 a few days ago, and now I want to withdraw" and actually getting close to $100, not something like $95. (Or worst case some dismal amount)
@_date: 2013-05-21 20:24:22


I wouldn't have to, the problem would solve itself.


Who is going to trade for goods? 99% of bitcoin stores out there use Bitpay or some kind of intermediary to immediately convert bitcoins to currency.
What you talk about would happen, but I would be surprised if Bitcoins had parity with the USD after a complete Fiat block happened.
@_date: 2013-04-25 22:51:09


Is a strong word, and does not apply here at all. Especially when the backbone of the entire prediction is that Bitcoin captures 1% of a particular market.

If deceit is involved I would agree with you.
For instance banks bringing in zero % credit cards onto college campuses (and the college campuses getting kickbacks to allow it) is reprehensible. They are specifically targeting a weak section of the population with carefully worded adverts that avoid all of the problems with credit cards.
However if you are adult and someone tells you "I will loan you up to $6,000 at a rate of 24%, and can explain in detail what that means" and you go run up the credit card, then you can't exactly complain when 3 years later making the minimum payments you still owe $4,000.
Now if you want to bring in the working poor into the equation is does get more complicated I will agree, but I don't know if it is a companies job to encourage its clients to be smarter about their finances.
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:23:31
There isn't really a good way to do 3 peer to peer. The problem is the moment you start talking about Fiat currency you need someone to hold onto said Fiat currency (they also typically hold Bitcoins that are being sold).
If the P2P network says I have $150 and I want to withdraw, who do I get the money from?
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:55:09
Looked at Ripple, looks like an interesting premise, but I am curious about how you would manage it without managing it.
My only fear would be the problems banks in the US had before insurance was mandated, a minor scare could create a cash shortage very easily. Assuming that price is mandated by the gateway they could also drive the price down really fast as they tried to avoid running out of liquid fiat currency.
@_date: 2013-05-22 16:03:00
"Other people can move money illegally so Bitcoin won't care if it can't move money legally" is a logical fallacy.
A Bitcoin won't be worth a dollar if you can't do an online transaction to convert it to fiat. Remember everything you can do with Bitcoins right now is facilitated through an exchange. All of that utility would disappear. What value would it hold then?
If bitcoin all crypto currencies are targeted equally, then Bitcoin will survive by means of being part of an interesting market. The current market value will mostly disappear, but it will survive.
However if Bitcoin were singled out it would not, there are too many alternative crypto currencies to try and right a dying ship for the average person.
@_date: 2013-05-07 19:56:11


I was quoting the cost at $12,000 per BTC. If no miners have updated by then, then a bank transfer is cheaper. The actual cost to the bank to do a money transfer is much more than 60 cents, they just eat the cost.
Hardcoding is the reality in this kind of situation, the code being changed has to be hardcoded as it doesn't have access to enough information to determine a valid value. They don't know the volume, they don't know the value of a BTC, they just have to have something.
@_date: 2013-04-19 22:16:14
Since the transaction history is distributed, there needs to be a way to disambiguate two branches of history. The primary point of disambiguation is complexity in getting to it. The hardest to obtain history is the "correct" one.
If you can generate blocks faster than the rest of the network, you could create your own clone of the block chain that isn't published. It could have a higher complexity than the one everyone is authenticating from. This allows you to change the blockchain history after it has been "confirmed".
@_date: 2013-05-22 20:18:53
Again, the same applies to USD. Every time a loan is repaid money is destroyed. If you have 10 currency and deposit in a bank which then loans out 9 currency, 9 currency has been created. If you then try and get your 10 currency, the bank goes into default since it only has 1 currency.
There is nothing magical about reserve banking other than the fact that it is allowed by otherwise strict banking law.
@_date: 2013-05-22 17:44:42
Yes, yes they can. People don't seem to understand how fractional reserve banking actually works.
Remember with the "creating money" logic, you have to count money held as being worth the full value still. So in this example you bring in 10 BTC and end up with 19 BTC. Eventually you would have 90 BTC worth of deposits if you kept up the loaning scheme.
Sure if everyone tried to get their money there would only be 10 BTC, but that is how the real world works too. Banks are insured by either the FDIC or NCUA to handle this circumstance.
