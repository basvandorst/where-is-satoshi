Agree, but we are also not drawing any conclusions - we build tools &amp; APIs for you to analyze and retrieve data from the blockchain and draw your own conclusions.

Yes, but not only. One other form could be a category, let's say an 'exchange'.

Our goal is to provide the best tools to access data from the blockchain, make it easy to understand and provide insights to our customer's questions. Adding meta data to it in form of tags, categories, etc. is part of it, yes. But compared to Blockchain.info for example we are not focused on crowdsourced information.
@_date: 2015-03-01 05:03:00
Potentially, if that information is publicly available. It is not our primary focus though. Yes, I know - it is not just a simple yes or no answer. Our framework will allow a customer to link their own proprietary data and leverage their own information through our platform. In which case we are not directly linking an address to an identity, but rather expanding the knowledge.
Nonetheless, if we can identify entities like an exchange or payment provider, we might add that to the publicly available service, like the walletexplorer for example.
I hope that answers your question.

how is what is described in this article not the complete opposite of net neutrality?
**not** prioritizing data-packages with higher payments attached is exactly the point of net neutrality, so that a startup with little resources has the same chance to reach a customer as a multi-billion dollar company.

We have implemented the first heuristic, meaning we are looking at shared inputs of transactions. You can find a more detailed explanation in the research paper:

I guess those licenses come handy if they ever reveal a P2P money transfer feature in the messenger

The [Blockstem API]( is the public service on top of our backend infrastructure which we are using to develop our intelligence platform.
Anything specific you are looking for?
@_date: 2015-02-18 00:50:56
no it's not open source, but feel free to test the API during the free beta program and we will also have a free tier in the future
