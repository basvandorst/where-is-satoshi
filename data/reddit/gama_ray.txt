I love the look of this, but have never sued github or BTT. How exactly do I set this up? I've followed the directions on github, but nothing is appearing on my touch bar.
Also, Aion would be a great coin to add!

I am fairly new into the game, but I have heard countless issues about kraken making people lose money and causing headaches for users. 
I have not heard the same about bitfinex, so I would move there if I were you.

Can someone explain this depth chart to me? I see it on GDAX, but have no idea how to interpret it.

This is working great! sorry to bother you again, but I was looking into doing this with ethereum and litecoin as well, but the same method does not seem to work. Does google finance not support these cryptos yet?

That is part of it. As the pump and dump has subsided and people that ran to BHC realize that their vision of killing BTC did not work, they are returning. 
The announcement of square cash implementing bitcoin usage has also caused a bit of excitement.

I see that now thank you! however, the fees are raised even higher on a site with already high fees so I was looking for a way to avoid that.

Oh man sorry to hear that, but would you say computer science is the best path for someone looking to have future career involving block chain technology?
