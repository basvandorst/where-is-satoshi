If you are playing with margin. Make sure it is not a huge pip and have stop losses in place.
It literally is just financial gambling.

Or just refuse to pursue materialistic lifestyle.
Honestly, a car gets you from a to b. Thats all.  Live a minimalistic lifestyle and build for retirement. That's why we invest in bitcoin in the first place.
It is just one of many investment vehicles.

You got to look at it from a womans perspective.
Once bitcoin becomes involved in things women are traditionally interested in. Like fashion, performing arts and entertainment will you then see a more gender neutral turn out to such events. 
Bitcoin movie night would be an interesting concept. Make every transaction bitcoin friendly. Have the movie a documentary movie of cryptocurrency.

... we engineers do that all the time.
Its called being pragmatic. Bad engineering practice is building something that isnt fully utilised.
Scalability is great.

Rofl to think he is a professor of economics. Ironically can't even get his research and facts straight. That response wouldve scored 0 in an exam question about bitcoin.

so the bot can buy low, and sell high. Check out high frequency trading.

wait, is bitcoin a currency or a stock to hold/trade with? problematic much
@_date: 2013-06-12 16:00:25
ponzi scheme alert! seriously though, the amount of people who got burned by bitcoin, these so called 'angel' millionaires better be doing something good in return.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:33:18
You are correct. Someone is doing high frequency trading. 
Basically, using his computer to buy/sell at a much faster level, with more information than any human being can. 
HFT should be banned!

easy. Look at what the charts are showing. 
is this right? The selling point for us common folks is $120.00, which gets instantly bought out. Yet, when we try to buy, we are still paying $170~.
How can that be so? Only a really fast computer can be beating you for speed of transaction!

welcome to the world of high frequency trading. It happens on NASDAQ with all trades done by these super computers. From basic understanding, what the computer is doing here is trying to find the lowest point someone is willing to sell at by executing a buy order whenever someone issues to sell. It creates panic, person issues a sell order then the computer buys it. Rinse and repeat until it reaches the lowest point someone is willing to sell. These high frequency traders are both dangerous and helpful at the same time. If it bounces back, Bitcoin  will prove to us that it is a very resilient currency. I feel sorry for those who panicked and sold.
