There are good products and bad products produced everywhere.  I think the issue for many Americans is that for many years "Made in China" was synonymous with a lesser quality product in the American mindset because the Chinese can/would produce things at a lower price point which may inherently cause a product to have flaws.  This led to American's of a few generations to have a mindset that "Made in China" means the product is a lesser substitute.  I was taught this viewpoint as a child and I am 31 years old.  I now don't think anything of contacting a Chinese company directly and ordering things.  I even have a small import business.  祝你生活愉快

I think ePacket would be acceptable to many US users with the option to upgrade to DHL or Fedex IP for faster service.  Also consider an eBay store which will give you easy reputation and payment service (PayPal).  I see many Chinese sellers on eBay now.  Just some ideas.

Do you know where you saw information that they were not?  I was trying to find it myself.
I found this at  but it's basically the same information as found in on linux-usb and may be exactly the same.  USB-IF doesn't provide an official list to nonmembers.
