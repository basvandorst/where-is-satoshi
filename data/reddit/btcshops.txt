We accept payment only via bitcoin for the toy shop so everything is already included in that price.

We didn't even know about that! Will look into it. If a client needed a more involved integration we'd certainly be up to it, of course the price would increase with the complexity. 
@_date: 2014-08-12 19:32:31
That's exactly what I used at first when we were contacting only woocommerce sites!

Sometimes we do mention it, other times we don't. Unfortunately there seems to be some major misconceptions about Hong Kong.     
Just reminding everyone that HK is not exactly China [CNBC- the most expensive city to live and work in]( :-) We have employees around the world working remotely but not a single of them is based in mainland china.  
When they were paying us, paypal immediately informs them our HK address so surely they must have known at that point, but they never asked or said anything. When scheduling our meeting w/ them we mentioned the time difference and they were a little surprised. Without an established business relationship asking for a higher amount of money would surely require more due diligence on their part. I think for $400 it was easy for them to part with after we did show them example bitcoin sites we had done. 
@_date: 2014-06-30 13:33:08
Wow those are some impressive pics. At first I thought you weren't going to respond to the guy as our company does not have a physical office in the Philippines even though most of our staff is there. These days with technology companies such as yours it sometimes doesn't make sense to have an office. Only 2 of our employees live in the same city as PH is pretty spread out. 
People on the internet are always asking to see the office, like it makes companies more real, but we found an office to be quite an expense when everyone prefers to work from home. I'm guessing most of your 1000+ staff works from home as we found most of our employees are in various cities taking care of older parents or they are single mothers. 
@_date: 2014-06-11 18:18:33
ha good question, the business line that these screenshots were pulled from has been in biz for 1 year. Unfortunately we were looking at expenses like employees and paying out suppliers, but our excel financial model had a very inaccurate 2.5% paypal fee (based on an old excel file from one of our other companies - which incidentally was always wrong).  
Pretty embarrassing I agree. All this aside things, businesses is doing very well and lots of reserves to pay staff, etc, and we have not been paying ourselves and only re-investing into the company... so we didn't notice that what was in the account was starting to slide from what our excel reporting said (and with the huge reserve it's not like we can withdraw to our bank account often). 
@_date: 2014-06-11 10:09:14
Definitely not in dildo sales!! Lol this was from other business lines as well - you'll see that our toy shop only accepts bitcoin payments so this is not from that shop but yes the next headline I post is "$250,000 in Dildo Sales with Bitcoin and NO Fees!"
@_date: 2014-06-11 12:53:00
Yep definitely agree - for this new business we're only processing via bitcoin. For our legacy companies (6 companies) we will starting today, (because of you) give a 12% discount for paying via ฿. Until we did this calculation last night we had no idea how much we were loosing. If anyone pays via ฿ we cut out both paypal and the seller platform middleman, not to mention help out the community since we **hold** and do not cash out to fiat. Don't want to list the companies here cause if we were to link up the toyshop with our normal biz lines, never know if paypal would shut us down due to that silly *operation choke point* we read about in the news. I will go update our other sites to reflect this discount now.
@_date: 2014-06-30 13:27:55
I'd say it's a good answer cause as the owner of the company they can make a decision at that point how to handle it. Surely they registered with some exchanges to obtain bitcoin in the first place. No doubt they have bank accounts outside of Philippines, and could easily sell bitcoin off at Bitfinex or Bitstamp. All they have to do is have the accounts setup in advance to get through AML procedures then when they run low on Pesos, they just sell some btc off in advance as it will no doubt take a long time for fiat to come from Bitstamp to bank.  Either way if they employ 1000 people they know what they are doing when it comes to payroll and likely have lots of capital on hand. 
@_date: 2014-06-11 10:15:27
We started accepting BTC in our other business lines a few months ago, only one of our normal customers contacted us to pay via BTC though, and at first I was really excited but then he asked "how can I tell how much BTC I have?" so I prepped a tutorial for him, etc how to pay, and asked him "where is your wallet, software or hosted at coinbase/blockchain.info or where did you acquire your bitcoin?"....  then he sent me a link to a free faucet, so he had like 6 cents worth of btc for a $150 product so that didn't work out.  The biggest problem I see now is customer education about btc, so I try to spread knowledge with every email to our list. 
@_date: 2014-08-12 17:39:32
Very glad to hear it! I hope you have even greater success than us. Please do PM me about it or post here, would really love to hear you made some sales today even!  We did promise this client we would not bring bitcoin integration services ourselves to any other Lawyer in Miami. (after all there are plenty of other cities and niches for us to bring bitcoin to). But by all means I encourage everyone here to do more!
@_date: 2014-06-11 21:28:40
Appreciate that and I totally understand! Will PM you privately with info about our other businesses!
@_date: 2014-08-12 23:06:36
Good question, that was what we discussed with them on our screenshare with them. We don't want to get in the business of managing their scans or docs so that was the point we turned the account over to them. They changed the password and we simply explained to them what they needed to submit. The rest of up to them. If they get stuck they can ask us for help. The same way businesses must send in their docs to paypal, the client (law firm in this instance) will have to verify. They will have to do more than 1,000 a day. Luckily lawyers have paralegals who are experts are scanning and sorting out documents so they will not get stuck on that part if you want to call it "technical"
@_date: 2014-08-12 17:46:10
Thank you very much for posting this. This is so true. I know when we had to hire a lawyer recently we had many to choose from - and instead of  hiring the $500 one, we hired the lady who was $5000 due to her specific experience with similar IP issues.

@_date: 2014-08-12 15:04:02
ha, was a little worried about it but we have a very good relationship with paypal with a dedicated business support person. We have been in business many years and our paypal account has had lots of money put through it making paypal very happy. Of course we know paypal could shut us down always like a bank account could but we are not violating any rules of theirs as we are not selling bitcoin, just a web dev service. But I know what you mean, I'm sure paypal has a special filter that immediately flags the word bitcoin ha!
@_date: 2014-06-11 09:57:23
PayPal still has a monopoly with our customer base. We try to educate our customers about bitcoin and we would even use other ways such as merchant accounts but conversions do drastically go down; however, for our next business endeavors we are willing to take any decrease in conversions and just stick to it - bitcoin is the future and customers will soon realize this as well.
@_date: 2014-06-11 12:43:42
I agree PayPal is dead easy and bitcoin still has a long way to go before it is completely customer friendly. And everyone has a PayPal account.
Now regarding converting fiat to bitcoin if you do it via an exchange it's not that bad. For bitpay I calculated it and the exchange because of the bid and ask spread is about .3%.
What do you mean regarding time delay?
Agreed that bitcoin has not hit it's critical mass but I think there are a lot of people and companies ready to make sure that it will hit it's critical mass within a few years.

This is very true. I was motivated by someone on reddit who said they once made $200 and it took them 30min to remove some virus someone had on their computer. They simply installed some free antivirus. I am both consumer and consultant. There is plenty of stuff our business has to spend massive amounts of money on, accountants, lawyers, etc. For something we have no knowledge how to do or isn't part of our core business we are willing to pay a lot. Once we hired a zendesk consultant and paid them big bucks just to configure rules in our desk. The rules were simple (if we knew how would have taken us 30min)... it was knowing what rules really would help us due to the type of tickets and workflow we were doing that we didn't know. Well worth as we determined our cost per ticket is $1
@_date: 2014-06-11 10:01:53
It's not our partner - it's a platform we use that does affiliate tracking, stats, analysis, product delivery, etc. 3rd party payment processors such as 2CO or others offer better rates but still it's a 5.5% fee so if we integrated that with our platform then it would still be pretty high...unfortunately they don't offer that integration. But yes there are some other solutions but each has it's pros or cons...we'll let this business run this way even though we're going to continue to get hit but process payments via bitcoin only with our future ventures.
@_date: 2014-06-11 12:57:27
Already working on it - got a prototype ;)
@_date: 2014-08-12 17:32:41
I too used to have this limiting belief. We only did not contact other EU countries since we do not have anyone on staff that speaks German, etc.    We have an office in the EU as well and have been to EU bitcoin conferences before. Bitcoin might even be more popular in EU. There is a whole street in Germany where many businesses take bitcoin.  is spanish, localbitcoins is finnish. All it takes is someone hitting a local business in their country. The ah-ha moment for these businesses is when you explain they have the option of receiving fiat or holding bitcoin (bitpay can cash out to their local fiat flavor or btc).
@_date: 2014-06-11 10:03:21
Also another solution is to have a bank account in the US so even if you're incorporated outside of the US as long as you have a bank account in the US you can avoid the FOREX fees just in case you're in a similar situation.
@_date: 2014-08-12 17:14:29
Assume many of these smaller local businesses are running wordpress sites, so some basic wordpress knowledge helps. If they end up having something more complex then you could either learn quickly about their existing systems or turn down the work and provide them with a referral. One of our clients were using magento and that was pretty easy to integrate with bitcoin as well. 
@_date: 2014-08-12 17:19:22
This - I'm so glad you made this comment. In our companies we have made it mandatory policy to use pgp for internal emails cause why not? Even if there is nothing sensitive about the emails it helps employees start to understand encryption and crypto-currencies. Not a single lawyer had a pgp key published (and I doubt they would have any idea if we asked for one).  Maybe that's another service to sell, but it's a bit like antivirus &amp; backup software, some people just don't want to invest until it's too late.   
@_date: 2014-06-11 13:52:26

Amazing work, I'm sure we'll be seeing this one on the front page of some newspapers/magazines soon!
@_date: 2014-08-12 11:09:35
That's great you emailed them that. Really helps support take that communication to the decision makers so they can at least feel good about their decision to take bitcoin. I also worry that the person in charge might get in trouble with his boss if there isn't a huge influx of bitcoin purchases, so your comment might help to save their butt.   
In this particular case study only one guy in the organization fought us. The head lawyer made the decision but the marketing guy was worried we were after his job (rightfully so) so he was constantly trying to paint us in a negative light. 
@_date: 2014-08-12 11:07:03
That was something that none of the people we contacted said so far, but our web dev friends said this as a possible rebuttal, so we prepared for it.  That's like saying - hey isn't facebook free? But everyday we sell social media services. Isn't google free? Everyday x law firm pays people to seo their sites, etc.  Also they could say wordpress is free and web development is free (if you know what you are doing) but they still hire web design companies.  So yes they are all free, legal advice could even be free, but if you want something good... you gotta pay :-)  
@_date: 2014-08-12 20:50:26
Yes! This is what they were planning on doing. We recommend it as well. This was a major part of why they wanted to accept bitcoin. Anything to differentiate themselves from all the other lawyers out there. Similar to overstock (where I think btc is less than 1% of their transactions), this lawyer does not expect an influx of business overnight or any new clients necessarily. They did this cause they like the idea of bitcoin, and 2) possible free publicity. 
@_date: 2014-08-12 10:04:37
Thanks! First we called up every type of business that had a woocommerce based shop, all were very receptive. While we have yet to identify a specific niche that does better than the rest, we found it good to focus on one niche per day. The key thing that predicts if they will buy your service seems to be how much money they currently spend on seo/advertising/adwords/their site. So the more they spend on their web presence the more likely they are to invest in your service. 
@_date: 2014-09-01 09:16:19
That is actually pre-requisite   post picture 
@_date: 2014-08-12 11:20:48
After that client we actually decided we should have charged more :-)  
It's true all the things we did were *free* to us. We usually charge a lot for web development and design more Saas products than websites for customers so this was more of an intro service to later sell them on other services that we can provide. We hired a uk intellectual property lawyer this month for an IP issue. They charged us 3000 GBP ($5,035 USD) and all they did was write an email for us!  
So yeah we agree that it was free for us to deliver, but to be worth your time I recommend charging as much as the client is willing to pay as they will always bug you down the road for more support and communication. 
@_date: 2014-08-12 10:58:38
ha that's a great article! Will tell my friends. I guess people go to the plastic surgeon then turns around and hire the lawyer for personal injury law suit right? We showed all the law firms this article (not our article) and that really helped when they saw social proof of other lawfirms accepting btc: 
@_date: 2014-06-11 21:52:04
Yep definitely - just some people here also have other platforms and things that they need to take into consideration. Even without that the fees are pretty high.
@_date: 2014-06-11 10:05:41
I agree that sales will be much less with the bitcoin only business ventures such as the toy shop - we added bitcoin options to everything we do unfortunately in those niches no one took us up on it yet...
@_date: 2014-06-11 21:37:49
Hey man - at this point all bitcoin that we are accepting will not be converted to fiat but will stay via bitcoin because we have enough money to make sure everything is running smoothly; however, if it does take off beyond wild measures then we'll just keep profits in bitcoin and the rest will be recycled for operating costs.
By the way to be transparent even though we are incorporated in Hong Kong the products are not cheap goods from China - we do use a dropshipper but they are US based and all the goods are shipped from the US.
@_date: 2014-08-12 20:47:10
Yes that part made me sad as well. We thought about telling them to make a coinbase account then sending us btc but figured they might have gotten stuck over email. Now that we have the relationship and have trained them we would try to get future services paid via bitcoin but 1 step at a time.   :-)
@_date: 2014-06-11 10:37:47
Nope it isn't but thanks for the link - definitely going to look at JPMorgan's and Goldman's views on bitcoin...great link appreciate it
@_date: 2014-06-11 12:49:57
With this I would disagree. We have been selling a lot of products online and I think that it's not the customer that gets scammed - it's actually usually the vendor when it comes to micropayments. Customers feel that they can get a refund for everything and they have no repercussions for chargebacks. Now if the vendor is a reputable one then the repercussions are HUGE even if the customer has no protection because they can severely damage the vendor's reputation. We always give immediate refunds if we don't deliver our end of the bargain and even if it's not our fault we usually let it slide and refund the money anyway just because we feel it's the right thing to do. If we didn't do this or if any vendor didn't do this they would get flamed online and an easy google search would show all these bad reviews (you should always do a search of "name of vendor" + scam) and you would know not to buy from that vendor. It's crazy but we have lost money to chargebacks just because the customer knew it's an easy solution and it costs us like crazy; however, if they reached out to us before trying to do that chargeback we would have refunded them no problem. Just my 2 cents because everyone I talk to about bitcoin always says that this is a problem with bitcoin but I think as reputations will be more visible online it won't be a problem
@_date: 2014-06-11 09:54:49
Yea we've been investing in bitcoin since it was $12 and it's amazing how far along it has come but it still has a super long way to go. I can't wait until the day that people make more payments via bitcoin than they do via paypal. Just like the internet disrupted many industries, bitcoin will too and this time it will be the banksters that will take the hit.
@_date: 2014-06-11 21:51:14
Don't want to start a war here but yes we do run a business that does this kind of revenue and it is probably 60%-70% of our revenue at this time - this specific software company. Like we mentioned below, we don't want to have our sex toy shop linked up directly with those companies.  
In my opinion the forex fee is kind of hidden and sometimes you don't realize the exact rules until you go through it. I realized that they'll take a cut from the forex fees immediately but I went through the process of trying to set up a USD current account in the place I was incorporated in at that time only to find out after I set it up that I couldn't withdraw to it. It really ticked me off because I went through a lot of BS to get that setup.  
Regarding the 5%, some people here experience further fees from middlemen so wanted to illustrate that point. Regarding "stop being an idiot" I won't respond to that.  
This story hasn't really gotten us any "targeted" publicity / sales and that's not a problem - we were ok with that.  
And like I mention below yes we will keep the bitcoin. My business partners and I keep about 60-80% of the liquid personal reserves in bitcoin and I plan to continue adding to that.  
@_date: 2014-08-12 20:43:39
Robotman - you are exactly right! The same way many small businesses hire a company to setup their social media or develop a mobile app for them, bitcoin will be the next thing. The bulk of our local client experience is doing social media services for them. We've had many portfolio sites for that but no sales page/call to action for the bitcoin service yet. We will develop that out for sure and see what we can do to make that a resource for other fellow web devs. Thanks for the kind words. I wish bitpay or someone else offered a white label service so we could "become bitpay". 
@_date: 2014-08-12 09:35:33
To really take bitcoin to the next level we need to ramp up local business adoption. Awareness of bitcoin will be high when every restaurant, lawfirm, plumber, or doctor you encounter takes bitcoin. Even though we redditors know the use case for bitcoin for merchants, you would be surprised how almost every business we contacted had heard of bitcoin but they didn't know why they would ever want to ever accept it.  
We are a Hong Kong company and we sold our "Bitcoin integration service" to USA, UK, EU local business - so its something you should be able to do even easier (if you live in any of those markets or have better english than us). Our friends and Web Developer customers found it even easier to sell to businesses local to them by walking in or speaking to the local business over the phone.   
Every single business we called had indeed heard of bitcoin in the news (great sign) but none of them knew the benefits to them (no chargebacks, saving on processing fees, publicity, etc).  It was really fun calling these businesses up as none of them treated us a cold caller but all were legitimately interested in bitcoin and wanted to know more… it was clear that noone had ever contacted them to offer bitcoin integration services.  
In the screenshots we show what we found to be the quickest method to get paid in advance for a simple "bitcoin integration service." Delivering the service consisted of simply creating a bitpay account for them and editing their website, then a training webinar to teach their people and the lawyers a little about bitcoin and how to facilitate payments.  We demo'd a test purchase with them live on a call, it blew their minds.  
At first we were going to use coinbase but since we serve clients worldwide we went with bitpay as we wanted to be consistent in our service offering and training.  We were paid by the client via fiat money/paypal so next time we'll see how we can get paid in bitcoin, in either case we quickly converted it to btc for holdings.  
I'd love to hear comments how you have started a convo with a business you frequent about bitcoin and eventually got them to accept bitcoin (and maybe you did the integration for them).  
**TLDR:** If you want to make quick money while simultaneously helping bitcoin community, reach out to local businesses to do "bitcoin integration services".
@_date: 2014-08-12 17:26:57
So far we haven't built out a site to advertise it (and the link for the client to pay was simply a direct paypal link). Instead we did provide links in our emails to some other bitcoin sites we created (woocommerce sites)  
  NSFW  
It always seems to capture their attention. 
The law firm had many competing priorities so it was very difficult to nail everyone down on 1 day to meet. I found lawyers to often be the least technical type of business owner. They had never attended a webinar and were not able to get the gotomeeting audio working so eventually we just called a phone there and they put us on speakerphone. It was very much a Q&amp;A and everyone was excited to tell their friends they worked for a firm that accepted bitcoin. I almost got the sense the main lawyer was going to go golfing w/ his buddies and brag that he beat them to accepting bitcoin! 
@_date: 2014-06-11 12:53:37
No problem understand.
@_date: 2014-06-11 10:28:45
I would love that or if payment processors integrated bitcoin into their payment options. The cool thing about bitpay nowadays is that they changed to a SaaS model so you won't even pay fees other than the regular bid ask spread if you cash out to USD. But like you said they don't allow customers to pay via credit card and we could integrate that into our Toy Shop but at this point we're going to stick with BTC.
@_date: 2014-08-12 14:35:26
Agreed, we do urge the lawyer /business to offer a special discount. They did not want to advertise this and said they'd treat it on a customer by customer basis as they would with other discounts they might give. I know as someone who only wants to buy stuff using bitcoin, it would be a big help if everything I wanted to buy had the option to pay in btc. For my friends who don't use btc yet, everytime they see another shop that accepts payment they ring me up and tell me, and they get that much closer to believing in btc. 
@_date: 2014-08-31 10:30:45
Appreciate the comment. To some $3m is a lot. To others who are making a ton it isn't but I don't think those are the type of people that are interested in the opportunities that we offer. Regarding the comments, please see below:
    Start their own profitable Bitcoin mining operation


 
What we want to provide is the right information - a 5 hour course that studies current mining operations, pools and gives you a breakdown of the suppliers, realistic profits or how much bitcoin will have to go up in the future to make it profitable, etc.
    Whitelabel an exchange in their country


Again, this is an information product business. The courses this company will release will talk about legal complexities, incorporating within that country vs offshore, bank relationships, etc. Plus I do know people trying to start exchanges that would provide feedback.
    Do angel investments into Bitcoin startups


I would disagree. There is a Bitcoin craze right now and people are throwing money at Bitcoin startups that have no monetization plans but then again this happens again and again with VC funding. How do I know? Because outside of our incubator I am also a angel investor and it's been a huge learning process. Plus quality deal flow and access to the best deals is something that takes a ton of research and relationships. Once again these are information courses and I know that people are looking for good information about these topics if synthesized correctly. 
    Start a Bitcoin integration business for local businesses


Yes - we have done this personally.
    Trade Bitcoin profitably


There is no guarantee for anything. Definitely not trading. Coming from finance people lose their shirt all the time. But once again these are info products so interviewing successful traders, trading moving averages, comparing volatility of the Bitcoin market vs. regular financial markets and things of that nature to show people how to possibly invest and if they want to invest if they should just buy and hold or try to trade price swings.
    Buy and run a Bitcoin ATM


Yes but it is more complicated. You also need to be able to find a good location, potentially get licenses, figure out how taxes/VAT and everything else works and that is why in my opinion good and detailed courses about these topics will be popular.
@_date: 2014-06-30 13:20:12
Another use case for your service is overseas companies using this to pay their Philippines employees!  
We own a number of companies all incorporated in Hong Kong, but 24 employees work remotely from the Philippines. We usually send them money via paypal and they get hit with massive fees (which we don't cover). As a company we hold BTC and we could use your service to pay employees out without them incurring any fees. Be sure to advertise this, and have Philippines remote workers let their online employer know this. 
@_date: 2014-08-12 11:26:56
So true! Yes, the toughest part was getting credentials for their wordpress site. If we had everything we had needed right away we could have done the whole thing in 30min but we instead had to navigate their organization and play politics with their marketing director (who was worried we'd steal his job) and then he put us in touch with their external web dev team, then we had to explain and finally they gave us limited wordpress account credentials. Then we also had to spend a lot of effort to get the banking details from them just so we could input it into the bitpay system. Experienced web developers know you would only offer this steal of a deal if the purpose was new client acquisition. For us it was worth it since we won the bet, and we love bitcoin (we would have done it for free even!) and hopefully we'll be able to sell the client on our much more expensive services (in talks now that we've won the marketing director over).  
@_date: 2014-06-11 10:35:24
My belief is that the bitcoin community is made up of like minded individuals who are enraged by what's going on with paypal, financial institutions and other industries that have been controlled by a few players and this new wave of bitcoin entrepreneurs are introducing new business models, more in touch with customers and this will propel bitcoin...
@_date: 2014-08-12 15:01:05
cool that makes me really happy to hear. I know a lot of bitcoiners are also skilled with basic web dev and without a doubt it can even be done as a hobby thing. I wanted to inspire everyone and maybe in a few months coinmap.org will have thousands of new biz :-)
@_date: 2014-06-11 21:40:22
Appreciate the support - yes that is the case. Publicly I do not want them to be linked. The other businesses are software product businesses and they are not ecommerce stores so they are completely unrelated. We are planning to potentially launch more bitcoin ecommerce stores and if we do then those we don't mind linking up with each other.

I had a similar experience with **Gemini** this month and was going to make my own post when I saw yours.  I really respect the Winklevoss and run my own software business so I know how hard it is to have your team stay on top of support tickets.  
 Timeline  
- June 4th Submitted Institution (Business Registration App). The app requires them to get back to you. 
- June 9th All business documents requested were submitted
- June 12th Fully approved by Gemini 
- June 12th Bank Wire sent from our business bank account
- June 12th Email stating they seemed to have made a mistake. Even though we applied as Institution/Business they had us down for a personal account, but they would resolve.  
- June 13th Gemini Asking for more info. 
- June 14th We responded back with the additional info that was requested. 
- June 20th They mentioned they are looking to approve our account still, Bank Wire was never sent back.  We ultimately don't want the bank wire back, we just want to proceed to use the exchange and were sure to let them know this.  As we were approved relatively already, now it seems strange the timeline to correct their error. 
We too tried to call and have emailed in everyday regarding this. Their communication has seemed better than what others on reddit are saying about other exchanges in all fairness. I do know they are swamped but worried my account has fallen through the cracks due to the issue that initially happened where they sorted my account as personal instead of business for some reason. 
Any advice is appreciated on how we can escalate this further.  
 
**Update** - This is now resolved, my business account has now been activated as on Monday June 26th 2017
