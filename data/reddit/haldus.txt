Yea sorry good point, I hadn't really thought it through. I suppose I was saying that these large ups and downs tend to happen over reasonably short periods of time with longer periods of reasonable stability in between (admittedly at substantial differences in price). And then that those using bitcoin for buying commodities rather than an investment know the market is volatile but look past that, sometimes the USD they put into bitcoin can buy them more and sometimes less but that is the risk they have taken.
So would you say that bitcoin won't be truly stable until it basically has its own stand alone economy so to speak? With people being payed and things being bought on a large scale all solely in bitcoin?
Reading over this and it doesn't seem very clear but fuck it, it's late and expressing myself clearly is hard

What makes you think it is low atm, why wasn't it insanely overvalued before? For a long time everyone thought $3 was high then $80 then $250 then $80.  After the massive surge to $1000 everyone seems to think $900 to $1000 is about right so below that is buying time. Why that figure though? I'm genuinely curious

haha good point, no one ever specified where the moon was! God damned ambiguous and totally misleading!

Oh I agree, I don't see this lasting but how long until those things happen and how far will it drop in the meantime?  Obviously if it hits $1000 dollars again everyone who held is happy, but if it dropped to $100 first and you sold and bought back you are laughing all the way to the bank

what exactly does confirmed by sources mean? How can anyone really know?

It depends on what your aim with bitcoin is.  If you want bitcoin for day to day purchases then this doesn't matter.  If you are a "to the moon" believer then this doesn't matter because bitcoins are going to be worth $10000 each (or so many a poster here seems to believe anyway).  If you are looking to make a return on the investment you made in a volatile uncertain currency market it would be a good bet that the price will drop further and potentially by a lot. So you should sell now, then buy back in when you can't take the stress of your gamble any more.

I made some sacrifices at the oracle, all I'm saying is I don't hold any bitcoin atm :P
