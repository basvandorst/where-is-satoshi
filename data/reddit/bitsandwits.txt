No one should use web wallets.

Yes, I send from [LibertyX]( to them all the time.

Seegwit2x is dead.
Bitpay will come around when they have no choice. Coinbasee offers the same merchant features.

Steam uses bitpay. Bitpay doesn't support segwit.

The end goal is they don't even know they're using LN I think. Steam uses bitpay. If bitpay had an LN channel open with a bunch of wallets it would be the same UX from the customer/steams perspective.

I think more so core's new fee estimation algo. Personally, I'm paying about half using core than electrum, and always get in the next block.

Anyone on P2P platforms typically pays a premium of 10-20%. So this isn't impressive. 
There's a guy selling near me for $4,715.00 a coin. 14.6% at the current rate of btc.

I've used bitcoin with them for about a year now.

I'm a rich man.

I feel pretty good about no one hacking me now, since it's been stuck syncing for 6 hours. 
Can't hack me if my wallet don't work.
@_date: 2017-09-27 16:19:45
Oh ok, I get what you mean. Yeah they were really late to the party.
@_date: 2017-09-27 16:16:35

@_date: 2017-09-08 14:18:40
Thank you
@_date: 2017-09-08 19:30:35
For users, that is true.

I would have her contact [DigitalMint]( -- they shouldn't be letting old ladies come into their stores and do $2000 in a transaction to a scammer with no safeguards or warnings.

lol is lower better? (I know nothing of mining chips)
