Oh so then Greece isn't about to default, Puerto Rico's default was a complete hoax, and the entire world financial system is actually all hunky-dory with no worries?
I wish I had some of that wool you're using to pull over your eyes.

If the devs keep up their incessant bickering and indecisiveness, I'm sure soon enough they'll have the same approval rating as Congress.

The thing is though they've been in bad shape for several years. I've heard about the PIGS (Portugal, Italy, Greece, Spain) in financial talk since 2009. And then curiously the world markets ended up having one hell of a prolonged rally for the following half decade.
So... are the cards finally just now falling, or is this crisis going to be held off for another half decade through some kind of financial sorcery? Believe me, I know the tricks being pulled to keep Greece afloat are ultimately unsustainable, but the exact timing of collapse is impossible to know for certain. For all we know this could go on for another half decade.

Or maybe people want mass adoption because they'd like to see this currency succeed globally rather than stagnate and cater to a fringe minority and end up having very little common use. An increase in value is also nice, but that comes along with mass adoption.
It's fine to criticize people who want mass adoption NOW because they foolishly put their life savings into bitcoin when it was at $1000. But not everyone who is in bitcoin did that, and people like me are perfectly content waiting several years before we get mass adoption. I'd rather bitcoin be ready for it. As things currently stand, bitcoin is not ready for mass adoption.
Raising the blocksize limit is one of the things that needs to be done, however. Anyone who thinks bitcoin should stay at 1MB forever is a fucking retard. And the people who think it will be detrimental to bitcoin to raise the limit sooner than later are either fools, drama queens, or have some kind of alternate agenda.

Actually I'm glad Satoshi made this mistake. Putting in a hard cap that can only be changed with a hard fork has given us a preview of what the politics will look like whenever a Bitcoin hard fork is proposed. If there can be so damn much debate and mudslinging for something so goddamn trivial as block size, just imagine how impossible it will be to do a hard fork for something that actually *is* controversial.
I've never thought an altcoin could one day overtake Bitcoin, but since apparently Bitcoin is no longer allowed to evolve by way of hard forks, eventually a better developed altcoin will take bitcoin's place (if the devs continue to keep politicking for the rest of bitcoin's life rather than evolve the protocol when it demands it).

Traders. The goal is to take some profit (sell) after a run up and re-enter before the next run up. A trader is the exact opposite of someone who buys and holds. They add liquidity to the market so they actually do the ecosystem a lot of good.
@_date: 2015-07-22 14:59:05
The only reason we have to do a hard fork is because Satoshi *screwed up* when he decided to make 1MB a *hard cap*. We're fixing a mistake Satoshi made. The hard fork is necessary for Bitcoin's future, as the 1MB cap was never intended to be permanent, even in Satoshi's own words. It has to be raised eventually. Let's do it sooner rather than later, ok?

He was probably just lazy and didn't want to have to countdown his drawer at the end of his shift, or was having some sort of issue with his till, or didn't have enough change and would have to call someone over to bring a roll of quarters or something.

I suspect if things get really stagnant with Bitcoin Core, companies with a lot of clout and trust like Coinbase will release a new version of the Bitcoin software that most users, investors, and miners actually want.

If I had a child, who is completely dependent on me, work for me for $0.15 an hour, I think most people would call that slavery. But if it's an adult who is completely dependent on a corporation for their income, and they make $10 an hour, we call that an acceptable job.
Yet if the parent with this slave child was a "CEO" that made $30,000 a year, paying them $0.15 an hour is far more generous than a CEO making $3,000,000 a year and paying an adult $10 an hour.

The pro do-nothing-ers seem to have a habit of throwing out evidence like that. And a 8MB increase is "wild"? Oh please. What was the average size of a block when Satoshi imposed the 1MB cap? Wasn't the 1MB cap at least 8x larger than the average block of transactions at the time?
Some people like to make mountains out of molehills. I really don't get it.
@_date: 2015-07-23 19:57:35
That's... not a very good metric to determine if something is a good store of value. In fact you want the exact opposite with a safe haven commodity. I don't know what percent of copper is used industrially, but it's way way higher than gold. But this means when an economy collapses, copper loses more value because industrial demand plummets, and therefore the price plummets. You want a price that rises during economic turmoil, which means the commodity should have very little industrial use.
And by the way, Bitcoin has 0% industrial uses. Does that make Bitcoin not a very good store of value, too?

True that. Even if Bitcoin succeeds in becoming the most adopted currency in the world's history, it won't stay that way forever. See: colonizing other planets and the latency problem of mining the blockchain from other ends of the solar system. Unless we figure out a way to send information faster than the speed of light...

When those of us in the peanut gallery give the Bitcoin devs criticism or share our grievances with some of them, others in this community make it out to sound like we're ungrateful bastards who are attacking the devs. But I think quite a lot of our talk is warranted. So many of us here are literally invested in Bitcoin. We want what is best for Bitcoin, and it is so incredibly frustrating to see the devs putting real issues on the backburner or not acknowledging them at all, or even worse, engaging in petty politics rather than doing what needs to be done. If things get so bogged down in red tape with Bitcoin, talent and money will move elsewhere.
I want to see Bitcoin fixed. How long will it take for the devs to implement Coblee's fix? Likely several months, and after much bickering. I get it, software development on such a project ain't easy. But we've already got a real world example of the fix working. It really should not take a long time to implement it into Bitcoin. And yet it undoubtedly will take a long time.

I think it's fair to say Bitcoin itself was unaffected by the spam attack, however Bitcoin *users* were indeed negatively affected. Some people around here are idiots and think we don't need to care about Bitcoin users. And yet, those idiots completely fail to realize that Bitcoin has no value if it has no users. User experience is very important to Bitcoin's future and well-being. The fact that Bitcoin can be attacked relatively cheaply in a way that harms user experience is not good for Bitcoin.
It's all pretty obvious if you ask me, but I guess common sense isn't common enough.

That is the dumbest thing I've ever heard. The trolls come out when the price drops, and the idiots come out when the price rises.
Please think logically for just one minute here. With the weakest BTC wallet, you lose everything. All your bitcoin. Gone. With "statist dollars" you lose some to inflation, and in a worst case scenario you lose most of it. But rarely all of it, and all at once, like you would with a weak BTC wallet.

So true. Few people realize how wealth can be created, or what wealth even is. Any time energy is put to work, and that work is valued, you've created wealth. This can even happen outside of human society. Plants can put the sun's energy to work and create fruit, and other animals value the fruit. The existence of this plant and the work that it does adds a kind of wealth that otherwise would not exist.
So when evaluating Bitcoin, the question comes down to what kind of value can this system of money add to society? Electronic cash that can be sent anywhere in the world almost instantly and with little friction, that no one controls yet everyone controls, and is backed by an immutable ledger, a record that is forever etched into human history and cannot be changed... sounds pretty valuable to society if you ask me.
