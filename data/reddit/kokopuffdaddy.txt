Not even 10 minutes. I was watching it live and it was maybe 2 minutes that it broke 19k. Most charts don't even show the ATH as 19k let alone 18.

So when did this sub go from informative to a rivalry against another sub that's meant to be for the exact same thing?

Dropping $100 in an hour is normal even when the price is on the rise. $100 is nothing to worry about because the next hour it could rise $200

Right? I don't see anything I haven't already seen 12 times in the last 6 months.

Add more accounts. My limit is $5000/wk from my checking account and $750/wk from my 2 credit cards

It's only down 12% over the last week. This is nothing.

I'm not disagreeing with you, but wasn't there also large support for websites before the dot-com bubble?
Also, saying "because it's not" is a fallacy and that argument doesn't hold up. It's like saying "because I said so".

How much could the interest have been over 3 months

And that's how millionaires are made. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 16:28:36
Probably about 100 times in the last 6 months
@_date: 2017-09-04 16:38:06
No. SELL SELL SELL
So I can buy at 3k

I can't tell if you're trolling or not.

You were probably blacklisted since you've already been banned from one of their banks, which I have no idea how you managed to do anyway but that's the only reasonable explanation. 
But since you were rejected from an energy company as well, I seriously doubt it had anything to do with bitcoin.
