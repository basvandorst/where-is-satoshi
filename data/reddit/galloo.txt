the key issue IMO is that there are already innovations (proof-of-stake, checkpointing, mining limits and rejection) that can be added to bitcoin to mitigate the risk of the 51% attack, but these will be difficult to introduce to bitcoin because ultimately the miners all have to agree to update their software.
if you had a chance to become the "federal reserve of bitcoin" would you upgrade knowing that this would put a stop to your activity?
why has nobody mentioned the altcoins that have specific adaptations to deal with the 51% issue in this thread? are moderators not allowing it... or are people just putting all their eggs in the bitcoin basket? have you not looked at peercoin PPC or goldcoin GLD?
either copy these adaptations into bitcoin, and try to get everyone to upgrade, or invest in the altcions that already have these safeguards in place... and let's just get rid of all this uncertainty!

wow! i would love to read more about this - do you have any good sources for this information?

it never ceases to amaze me that when an encumbent entity is faced with an existential threat, it usually doubles down on the very activity that has made it vulnerable in the first place, instead of embracing the disruption to their business model and changing themselves so they can survive.
the only tangible effect these 'regulations' will have will be to exclude new york from participating in the digital currency revolution... and this will actually HASTEN the demise of the existing financial hegemons.

Very well put sir! 
Reading this made me want to "follow" your username so I can keep up to date with your posts, but I don't think that's possible with reddit.
The only thing I disagree with is the bit about "political discussion". Replace the word "political" with "community" and you're spot on!

this thread has made me very paranoid. could there be an "arms race" in bitcoin mining... for people who want to control it? a "cold war" even?
@_date: 2014-06-16 20:25:47
same here... i'm really worried now
first, take control... then deal with the backlash from the community by forming a cabal to deceive everyone...

hats off to you, brave internet person... yes... you speak the truth!
the question i must ask you is if you believe that other alt-coins might contain fixes to these flaws, and ultimately win out... or do you believe that cryptocurrencies will never succeed?

"Bitcoins" are money... if you own 1000 bitcoins, you are rich because 1 bitcoin is worth about 600 dollars!!! Congratulations!
It's not like paper money in your pocket - it's digital money... like the difference between a paper document and a digital document on your computer!
To stop people "copying and pasting" bitcoins to create more money, the "Bitcoin" technology uses a huge list of very long numbers shared on computers all over the internet called the "Blockchain"... to keep track of everything. The blockchain is like a big ledger, keeping track of who is sending money to whom!
It's a long list of "Addresses" that contain a balance - of money. So as an example: Address 11111111111 can have a balance of 10 in money... Or, more correctly in this way: "The Address 11111111111 contains 10 Bitcoins".
Each address has one unique "unlock" number - like a key - and only this number can unlock the address to get it's contents out. So the "key" for address number 11111111111 might be the number 898989898989, and if you know it - you OWN it - and can spend it! This is your "secret key" that gives you ownership of this Address... and the 10 bitcoins in it!
You use a piece of software on your computer or phone to remember the numbers for you. This is called a "Wallet". It holds your addresses and unlock keys and this must be kept secret.
Spending Bitcoins is done with a wallet command like: "Transfer 5 Bitcoins from Address 11111111111 to Address 33333333333". This is published on the blockchain, so everyone knows that it has happened, and they can verify it.  Once you spend this 5 bitcoins by sending them to someone else's addresses, you can't spend them a second time - makes sense!!!
Always be careful... Bitcoins are real money... so do your research on safety/security first - the same way you would prevent someone stealing your cash - make sure you keep your bitcoins safe... and have FUN!

i agree 100% - other altcoins already contain very innovative solutions to many of the weaknesses in bitcoin - while introducing these to bitcoin itself would be virtually impossible because the miners have no incentive to update their software!
it will be one experiment after another, until we find the winner(s).

I've heard about tumbling coins. Is there a safe way to do this?
@_date: 2015-07-19 07:54:01
100% correct. This is exactly what HAS ALREADY happened!
