It's possible that his money was seized when the silk road was shut down. 
If you do end up looking for them, just tell the family that you think he had some Bitcoin on his pc, you don't need to tell them what it was for. I would say it's not unethical to go looking for the coins on his pc (I don't think he would mind), but it would be unethical to keep the coins (they should belong to the family now). If you find some, explain to the family that they might be worth more in the future and they should consider keeping them.

Yes, if such an episode were to air it would definitely be a satire, but think about the potential exposure! They would probably use a different name than Bitcoin, but I think if they did it right more people would look into the concept and discover the potential of crypto-currencies.
Thinking about buying some more coins on the off chance they do release a btc episode...

As the buyer all you need to bring is the code sent to you by Localbitcoins. Don't show this code to the seller. The seller will count your money then release the funds by sending a text to Localbitcoins. Localbitcoins then sends them a message with the same code you have - if the seller shows you the same code, you know that the funds have been released to your Localbitcoins account. You shouldn't need your laptop but you can use it to verify if you'd like. 
I guess there is always risk when meeting random internet people online, but the risk goes down substantially when you are dealing with people with a little reputation. I've had nothing but good experiences selling bitcoin locally. If anything, I wish I could have gotten to know some of the people better, they are my nerd bretheren.

If you have an android smartphone you can try installing a mobile wallet such as Blockchain. When you've got it all set up, try sending over a small amount. This serves two purposes: Helping you see how bitcoins are sent and received, as well as allowing you to easily carry some bitcoin with you everywhere you go! I have yet to encounter bitcoin in the wild myself, but you can bet that when I do I will be ready! 
As for the ELI5, it goes something like this: 
* Create your own personal wallet using one of the applications / services found [here]( (I recommend blockchain.info).
* Log in to coinbase
* Click "Send Money" in the top right corner
* Copy and paste your wallet from the first step, then enter the amount of bitcoin to transfer. (you may want to double check that the address is correct (and that it is one you control), and don't send the full amount of btc if it is greater than $200 worth)
* Don't worry about the message field
* Give it a few minutes, you should see the amount disappear from coinbase and appear in your wallet shortly.
That's it! It's addictively easy...

Alt coins are just crypto currencies other than Bitcoin. You can check out [altcoins.com]( it has a list of some you can check out. I think you should at least be able to mine any of the SHA-256 coins with a BFL miner. Yes the difficulty will be much lower, but the coins are worth much less. I can't even guarantee that this will be a profitable venture, I just know that it's possible. 
You can also check out [dustcoin.com]( Fill in your hash rate and power cost and it should show you the most profitable coin to mine. 
I've never done this myself, just read about it. Seems like a slightly better use of your device than as a doorstop. :)

If you're willing to wait, you might as well get started with the registration process on an exchange so you can buy Bitcoins in the future without waiting a week. From there just buy btc right before you make your order. You won't lose money, but you won't make money either. 
If you're wondering, I think the price will continue to go up. Then again, I held all the way through the last bubble...

As a seller:
* Wait for someone to respond to your sell offer
* Send the appropriate amount of Bitcoin to your Localbitcoins address
* After making sure the person actually wants to meet (some people just have questions) click "fund transaction"
* After you fund the transaction you will receive a release code. Text this code to yourself. I also take a picture of the code just in case I need to double check it at the location
* Save the phone number Localbitcoins gives you
* Meet up with the buyer in a public location (I've had success with random Starbucks- they're usually easy to find, even if you're not familiar with the area)
* The seller should make it apparent that he has the cash (I think the person with the least rep should transact first. If you both have zero rep, get his cash then continue).
* Text the release code to Localbitcoins (I find it easy to copy/paste the code I texted to myself earlier)
* Localbitcoins replies to your text with a message saying that funds have been released, as well as giving you a buyer code
* Show the buyer code to the buyer. He should have the exact same code. This is so the buyer can verify that you have released the coins (Localbitcoins would not give you the code if you hadn't released them)
That's it, most transactions take less than 5 minutes once you get the hang of it.

How does Eve know John's address? It's pretty standard procedure to use most addresses only once. Even if you were recycling addresses do you really think Eve could know any one of John's addresses? The only way she might would be if she was the one who sold him the Bitcoin...

As a buyer all you need to bring is the cash, and the verification code provided by Localbitcoins. 
Here's a quick step by step of the process from the buyer's perspective:
* Meet up with the seller
* Show him that you have the appropriate amount of cash
* Seller will send a text to Localbitcoins to release the funds. Seller may opt to use a laptop to release the funds instead, the result is the same.
* Localbitcoins replies to the seller with a text containing the same code you have.
* Seller may show you his text or just read the code out loud to you.
* Verify that the code you brought is the same one the seller provides.
* If it is the same code, you know he has released the funds and can go on your way.
The Bitcoin should appear in your Localbitcoins wallet immediately. You don't need to double check - the verification code should be enough. Should be a very quick process.

Great! Two more things you might want to keep in mind: 
First, You should add 2 factor authentication (2FA) to your coinbase account, as well as your wallet if it supports it.
Second, learn how to create a backup of your wallet. Store your backup where it won't be lost if your computer fails. 
Also, If you plan on storing your bitcoin for the long term (4+ years?) you should do some research into paper wallets.

A combination of: 
* People will pay a premium for anonymous Bitcoin
* People don't have bank accounts but still want to buy Bitcoin
* People don't want to wait a week+ to get registered and start trading (we'll be *past* the moon by then)
and probably some other things I'm not thinking of.

Like Cowboy_Coder said, China. 
Also, an early Bitcoin adopter discovered he had an old wallet with 800k USD. A lot of users read articles about him (it went to the top of Reddit) and thought this was an easy way to get rich quick (it is, but that's not the point). I think those articles was responsible for a good chunk of the 10k users we recently acquired. 
If you want to forget about Bitcoin again you should buy a few before you forget about them this time!

I honestly am not a fan of the other cryptos, but I am heavily biased being fully invested into Bitcoin. :)
The other coins have some different features than Bitcoin such as faster confirm rates or different total number of coin. I do think it is important to experiment and discover a potentially superior coin, but none that I have looked at seem that much better (I haven't looked at them all though). The only other coin I'm interested in at the moment is MasterCoin (which can't be mined anyway. Also if there were some revolutionary idea discovered that was sure to make Bitcoin obsolete, the Bitcoin devs could always add that code to the Bitcoin protocol. 
So what *I* would do would be mine alt coins then trade them to Bitcoin. Nothing is outperforming Bitcoin at the moment, but that could change some time soon. You could also short Bitcoin by investing in alt coins. Just trade the alts back to BTC when you think it's at the bottom of the dip! There is a coin to coin exchange you can look for if that interests you.

Thanks bro.

Sounds like you got phished. Clicked a link you thought was going to blockchain.info but actually sent you somewhere else. They enter your info on the real site as soon as you hit enter. You enter your auth code and they will be in your account immediately (could be automated). 
Possible clues: Check your internet history and bookmarks. Check your email, spam folders included. Do you remember clicking on an unsolicited blockchain email? Sorry but there's not much you can do. 
Because 2 factor is time sensitive they probably first accessed your account around the time your coins disappeared. If you haven't accessed your blockchain account in a while it's possible they removed the 2 factor at an earlier time but I highly doubt it.
Just some food for thought. 
@_date: 2013-09-19 12:37:13
You seem to think this is a get rich quick scheme that you missed out on. You wish you had bought in at $15 not because you thought this revolutionary system was a great idea, but because having an extra few thousand bucks would allow you to live for a few more months as an unemployed mooch. The truth is that even if you *were* given a free bitcoin, you would just spend it without thinking twice about how to acquire more. Of course people that produce nothing of value think capitalism is evil.

I've never heard of a 90 minute window, perhaps that seller's time is very valuable and he wants to make sure the transaction happens quickly? 
I've had orders stay open for a few days before while the buyer decides whether or not they want to proceed. When this happens I just tell them to open a new order so that we can do our transaction at current market price. Perhaps this is what your seller means? He doesn't want the price to fluctuate too much so he tries to get the sale done within 90 minutes?
@_date: 2013-10-08 04:36:34
The transaction process is as follows:
* You find an ad on Localbitcoins and initiate a purchase
* The person you contacted finds your offer acceptable and funds the transaction
* You receive a code of random numbers and letters
* You meet up and give the person cash
* The person sends a SMS to localbitcoins, releasing the funds from their account to yours
* Localbitcoins replies to them with the same code you received
* The person shows you the code they received, if it is the same code you know the funds have been released. 
Basically an escrow. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 04:27:27
Sorry bro I can't really say what else it could be. Possibly your computer is compromised? Does your blockchain login match any other login you have ever used online (especially any bitcoin related site)? That wouldn't explain how they got around your 2 factor though. You could ask blockchain for the login records on your account, odds are they will most likely be behind 7 proxies though. Sorry again man, I wish you the best.
