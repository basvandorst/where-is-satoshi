So as a LN node, it can charge transaction fees ? (regardless of how small) 
 and how would BTC staked on LN nodes in the network would work when peer A goes through the LN nodes to make payment to peer B ?

consistently getting "unable to make connection because target machine actively refused it " or times out ...tried several nodes 
Is there something wrong on my side ?

I am trying with zap and lightning apps ...both seem to be flaky
yesterday issue with creating a channel (timeouts or denied)
today my Zap wallet is not loading 
tried with lightning app and there shows 0 testnet BTC...i had 11000000sat
Is my set-up incorrect ? do I have to reinstall the zap-desktop or lightning-desktop apps ?
do any of my problems have to do with firewalls?

did some changes and i have my channels now..maybe firewall issues

ok I got it  - so that is what they mean by LN nodes provide liquidity.
So more money you can put on the LN channel will give you a higher profist. 
Any links to more info - like risks from bad actors ...etc 
Thanks

or just store them on paper wallet till 
after the dust settles and migration plan is in place. It seems like the way forward is not not settled yet.

yes i agree - 
keep on cold storage till migration after fork is in place. However there is also another safe option - sell BT before fork and then buy again after the split. Not a bad option, since  most likely price will be split along with the fork(Andreas' prediction) , and probably fall further due to temporary  volatility.

thanks, the article basically confirms what i thought.
