So one day in the future Bitcoin will just flip from being property to being money? It will still be the same Bitcoin only the perception is changed. What you hold is a private key which is just a very large number. How can a number be property? That is the same as saying I own the number '3'. Nobody can own the number 3 can they? 
For Bitcoin to become money people need to be able to use it and stop using government money. That will require the government to make huge changes in the the way they work. They will fight crypto every step of the way. Bitcoin is the worlds best chance of achieving sound money. It will only succeed if Bitcoiners grow a back bone and demand the changes we want to see. We are here for the revolution. You are either part of the problem or part of the solution.

An appropriately sized government where your tax money is being used efficiently is fine. The problem is governments only ever get bigger over time. They make mistakes like unnecessary wars, bailing out losers and end up paying for it with increasing piles of debt and taxes. They become focus on extracting more and more taxes and offer less and less services in return. This happens over and over again in history until a systems collapse occurs. How far along you are in the process is anyone's guess but some people notice it more than others.

There is no such thing as investing without risk. Wherever you put value there is a chance of loss. The human mind gets preoccupied with all the worst possible things that could happen and use them as reasons not do certain things. Trying to get some idea of the level of risk is a good thing, but this should only inform your position size and not be a reason to avoid something entirely. 
Bitcoin is an internet protocol. The Internet has designed specifically to survive any attack and even nuclear war. Bitcoin is just as strong as they are both decentralized with no single point in which it could be taken down. Bitcoin will continue to exist as long as the internet exits. Sure, its value could go to zero but what reason would you base that on? Maybe we find a better way of doing internet money that was 10 times better. Even then it would take many years for that new system to grow with plenty of time to see the change coming. Instead of guessing what could happen, instead look at what bitcoin is today. It has been here for 10 years now whilst being the fastest, highest rise in value of any asset in human history. The best performing asset of the last decade and no signs it is slowing down yet.

Yes you can do that. So long as you keep your 12 or 24 word backup phrase you don't even need the wallet as you can restore it on any device with any wallet software that supports BIP39. In fact, the wallet software is just generating a key pair using an algorithm. This can be done on an offline computer and bitcoin can be sent to the address without any wallet being downloaded at all, until you wish to send from that address of course. Test out the algorithm to generate addresses on this site [
The best practice is to install a wallet and send a very small amount to it first. Then delete the wallet to see if you can correctly restore it from the backup seed words. This will give you piece of mind that you can always access your bitcoin even if you keep it offline in cold storage.
Using Electrum or Wasabi on a thumb drive is still a hot wallet and not really any more secure than just running on your hard drive except I guess its not plugged in all the time. Trezor and Ledger have secure hardware element to sign transactions which is isolated from the system it is plugged into.

How exactly does a new asset go from zero with only a few people knowing of it, to a global currency used by billions of people with out massive upside volatile? You don't get adoption from being accepted as payment, you get it by regular people wanting to hold their money in this asset. First it starts as a speculative asset, then a store of value, then it reaches stability through being a financialized currency with deep order books, hundred of millions of holders and far higher valuations. Only then does it become a convenient median of exchange. There are no shortcuts only people making false assumptions of what bitcoin is for and where we are in the journey.

Bitcoin in the only innovation. You don't get the properties of Bitcoin from simply using a blockchain. Bitcoin works as you, me, everyone can validate every transaction from genesis using a basic computer. This is essential for a decentralized system. You can do this as the ledger is constrained and designed to be used as a base global settlement layer. If you needed large computing resources to run a node then it cannot possibly stay decentralized. 
Any talk of high TPS, Turing complete smart contracts, or putting the internet on a blockchain is a load of bollocks. If you have to trust someone to validate the ledger for you, what exactly have you achieved? Just trust a bank's ledger, it is far more efficient that using a blockchain. Anyone pushing alternative cryptocurrencies is either a scammer, or hasn't grasp how bitcoin works yet.

Well there is 18 million BTC in circulation, 1 - 4 million of which are lost forever. Many holders and institutions holding more than 1 BTC.

Price is the most important communication signal we have. A truly free market is the only way to allocate resources efficiently. If the demand for something grows for whatever reason, then price should rise. That way entrepreneurs will find a way to deliver a greater supply to chase the increased profit margin. If the pricing signal is warped by bureaucrats manipulating the supply of money, that can only lead to waves of credit expansion followed by the inevitable bust. The economy is organic, the very idea that humans can bend it to their own will is child-like thinking.

The Bitcoin network is a final settlement layer built to be maximally secure and decentralised. Equivalent to central bank reserves or holdings of gold in large vaults.

Bitcoin can always be lost, but also new bitcoin are being mined everyday. In the early days of bitcoin large amounts were lost or forgotten about as it had no value at the time. As the value grows people look after their coins better and the UX improves to make it easier. So less bitcoin is lost, whilst less bitcoin is mined over time. The overall supply is made to be as stable and fixed as possible, to be used as a measuring stick which all other assets are priced against. 
In theory the purchasing power of bitcoin may increase in line with global GDP. So instead of your money losing 2-3% of its value to inflation every year, your money will become 3-5% more valuable each year rewarding people who save.

Sure, everyone puts their money into index funds. Inflate every stock on the market which are already over valued by the unprecedented amount of money printing that has gone on. Then when the elites with insider knowledge pull out just before the collapse retail investors are left holding the bag again, happens every time. Rinse repeat every 10 years or so as people have no memory. You are the classic example of dumb money. Learn from history, not contemporary sources who are only manipulating the masses for their own ends.
What about the working poor? They cannot afford to buy assets. Their only option is to save in the national currency where inflation is constantly eroding away their hard earned money. So if they try to pull themselves out of poverty you would have them walking up an escalator that is going down?

Gold is valuable because it is the scarcest element found naturally in the earth's crust. What do you think happens to the value of gold if you found a magical way to increase the supply available? The innovation of Bitcoin is digital scarcity. Bitcoin is valuable because the supply is dis-inflationary.
Yes there needed to be some way to initially distribute the coins in a fair as manor as possible. The reward period lasts for 132 years. Most of the supply was released in the early years. But the security of the network relied almost entirely on the block reward, so either the early adopters are greatly rewarded, or it would have never even have lasted till today. Is 10 years not long enough for people so start paying attention?
Because of mining difficulty adjustment, the hashing power supporting the network is always relative to the value of the network. If price goes up, more profit to be made, more hashing power added to chase profit. If price goes down, less hash-power is necessary to secure a lower value network.

Nobody is ever too late. We still have 200x gain to go before bitcoin becomes money. It may take over 10 years and the speed of growth slows down as we get to higher price levels. But you are still buying into the best performing asset in human history.

Why would I blindly believe the stock market is less risky? That would be gambling. Investing is coming to your own opinion of the true value of an asset. I already told you traditional markets are in the mother of all bubbles from the fake money printing since 2008. We are in unprecedented times never before seen in all recorded economic history. People talk of QE and negative interest rates as if they were anything but complete insanity. There is systematic risk everywhere. There is an economic experiment going on and it is not Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is the most resilient computing system ever envisioned. I'm a computer engineer and studied this technology for 8 years. I'am confident it will keep producing blocks for as long as the internet exists. My slice of the 21 Million bitcoin will never be diluted and nobody can change the underlying consensus rules without majority consent. 
It will take a generation for the rest of the world to slowly understand the value of bitcoin. But bitcoin is going nowhere.

Understand you will have counter-party risk, but for many people that is the safer option for them. Especially if the crypto is insured.

The bitcoin network is not a payment system, but a final settlement layer for a new system of money. People compare it to the wrong thing. In the future it will be more equivalent to bank reserves who settle with each other infrequently. 
The network is never overloaded, only you can pay a higher fee if you need to get into a block sooner. Time is not an issue when you are batching a large amount of off-chain transactions into a single on-chain settlement transaction. 
When you pay for something today with your Visa debit card, that payment is not complete when you walk away with the goods. The transaction is registered in the system and may not be settled between your bank and the merchant's bank up to 30 days later. Bitcoin does this same final settlement in under an hour. There will be dozens of ways to do payment transactions with the currency of bitcoin. That is a separate and easier problem to solve compared to the problem of non-sovereign money.

The act of exchange doesn't magically imbue a digital token with value. People exchange goods and services for money because it is already valuable, and have high confidence it will hold its value over time. Until bitcoin proves itself as a store of value it is just needless friction, and no merchant in their right mind would except bitcoin. The monetization event is decades long. There are no short-cuts to an entirely new system of money that started from zero. I would only encourage people use bitcoin as a savings technology, payments are the secondary use-case of money
@_date: 2019-11-26 12:53:53
So many people think they can magically imbue value into a digital token simply by using it in the act of exchange. **NO**, people exchange goods and services for money because money is already *valuable*. Money only has value if it is a scarce resource that people are willing to hold as a store of Value. Bitcoin started at zero, it will only become valuable in the eyes of everyone if people constrain the supply by HODLING!

Governments take time to catch up to new technological developments. Have you seen legislators issue new tax frameworks on crypto? No, the IRS are simply applying the current tax framework by treating it like property for now.

Transaction time is not an issue as many others have already explained here.

So it doesn't matter what profession you are; doctors ,teachers ect, they must all learn to invest? Or at least pay someone to manage their capital? Put all the money in the market, take on risk to simply hold value and beat inflation? 
It is a very basic human desire to have a nest-egg stored away for a rainy day. Just the arrogance of governments and people like you who say no they cannot even have the dignity of a little security. The primary role of money is to transfer value through time. A store of value. If fiat money can't even do that it is useless, only the ghost of money.

Bitcoin is a digital ledger secured with energy from the physical world though hashing power. BCH currently stands at 3.1% of BTC's hashing power. That makes BCH very susceptible to being attacked from many large bitcoin miners. When it comes to money the security of your savings should be top priority. BTC is secured by the most powerful computer network in the world. Only a fool would hold their money on the BCH network.

In a sane world prices of goods and services would tend to decrease over time anyway due to better technologies and increasing efficiencies. Not consistently across the board but in most industries. As things get cheaper people are able to consume more not less right?
Money simply moving is not a measure of a successful economy. It's whether society is getting true value from the money they spend. It's the [broken window fallacy]( Even value destroying activities are added to GDP numbers.
@_date: 2019-11-06 11:26:06
Bitcoin started at zero value. It can only become money by attaining a sufficient monetary premium. Going from nothing to a multi-trillion dollar asset in anything less than 20 years would be obscene. It is doing extremely well in this aspect being the fastest, highest rise in value of any asset in history. The monetization event is this new asset becoming the most salable good in society. Of course that takes a couple decades as knowledge spreads and liquidity grows. Any faster and I couldn't even imagine what that would look like.

Absolutely. It takes most people a really long time to understand new technologies. Even most involved in crypto have yet to fully understand why Bitcoin works.
Ethereum: moving to POS. All POS coins held by 10% founders, 20% Binance, 20% custodial staking service for example. POS is clearly a scam.
Monero: non-starter if you cannot audit the blockchain.
IOTA: With no constraint on transaction through-put, who will have the computing resources to process and store an infinitely expandable bloated ledger?
Bitcoin chose the optimal trade-offs to ensure decentralization and security. Compromise either of these two properties for user features is the road to failure. I wouldn't trust keeping my pocket change on any of these other crypto projects.

If people didn't like the node software the devs are building they just wouldn't run it. You can keep using older versions, write your own software, or competing devs will build the software people actually want. 
It is open source entirely transparent with hundreds of eyes watching every code merge.
You will not find the decentralization anywhere in the software. Bitcoin is whatever the market chooses to be the legitimate version of the ledger by voting for it with their money, and holding the asset they believe in.
Bitcoin is not controlled by anyone. The consensus rules are easy to change on a technical level, but you need the social consensus from the majority of bitcoin users to actually get any changes to be adopted.

Bitcoin is internet money. A new global standard for currency to replace the central bank system of enslavement. An end to the Cantillon Effect where those closest to the money printing presses benefit the most. Obviously an entirely new system of money doesn't pop into existence fully formed. A few decades of growth, knowledge and price discovery is taking place. Bitcoin is still an infant, but money is the foundational technology of society which everything else is built around. It has only changed 4 or 5 times in all of human history, so it will be the most momentous event of the 21st century. A digital money for the information age.

Bitcoin is not a product, or an app you just download and use. It is an internet protocol, and a potential new system of money. Before it becomes money the asset must attain value and disperse coins far and wide. This isn't going to happen overnight.

The incentive to pass on fake goods no longer exists if you must also sign a message to an immutable blockchain that identifies your organisation.

The price doesn't follow the stock to flow model. It is just an accurate correlation of price history until today. A model is useful until it isn't. At some point I'm sure it will diverge and long before it goes to infinite. I think when a significant percentage of people hold and use bitcoin the price till diverge permanently as mining supply will have less and less effect on its value.

BTC is the only innovation that has occurred. You think nerds experimenting with code, and printing their own alt coins will be here long term? Even if they stumble on something innovative, it is open source code and can be incorporated into BTC someday.

I'm not saying it's not possible just improbable. There is a myth of Satoshi that everyone is trying to perpetuate. But I think he was not so different to many pseudonymous open source contributors.

We have an effective block size of 4MB now if everyone was using Segwit addresses. If you combine a block size increase with schnorr signatures, which further increases efficiency, you can probably get to 50-60 transactions per second. 
It is not really such a big issue as I see it, one day 99% of transactions will occur on second layer solutions, with the base protocol only needed for large transactions or opening/closing channels. It was never designed as a payment rail but as a final settlement layer and an anchor for digital trust. Just like TCP/IP was never designed to stream 4K Netflix but that feature can still be built on higher layers of the Internet tech stack.
@_date: 2019-08-08 22:12:11
The value of Bitcoin is very predictable on a macro scale. The correlation of price with the [stock to flow]( model puts Bitcoin at &gt;$100 K in the next couple years. 
Attempts at digital currencies in the 90s all required centralised solutions to solve the double spend problem. Any single point of failure means a system of money cannot really be trusted at scale. The first proof of work idea was used in Hashcash in 1997. So it took another 10 years for Satoshi to pull all the ideas together into making Bitcoin. Maybe it could have been solved earlier but timelines and inspiration are the random nature of history. 
Who knows what Satoshi did for a living. He never discussed personal information. Certainly not a professional coder. The first version was a monolithic block of code. Not enterprise grade or using industry standards.

Stock price is always green because we use inflationary currency? Actually I think you are on to something, but only because the fiat monetary policy is warping price signals. If stock prices are going up because the currency is being devalued is the value really rising?
The problem is not a question of inflationary or deflationary. It is the unknown in the supply of money in the future. Bitcoin is transparent and ultimately fixed at 21 million BTC. The value of dollars is changing on the whim of every Central Bank meeting making the valuing anything else in the economy impossible.

History happens. Empires fall, new paradigms emerge, technologies change the world. The position of the USD in world affairs is just a holdover from WWII when the US was the only large economy left standing. That position is long fading away with the world fast becoming a multi-polar world. The last 5 reserve currencies each lasted around 50 years. If you think the USD is something special when you say yourself, they could print any amount they want, hyper-inflating it to insignificance. The hardest currency ever seen is absolutely going against the softest currency ever seen, no matter how that makes you feel. USD doesn't stand a chance. BTC is not vulnerable, it thrives on people attacking it, proving its anti-fragile properties.

1. The number of possible private keys is largest than the number of atom in the universe. It would take all the computing power on the planet longer than universe has been in existence to bruteforce anyone's private key.
2. Money has been inflation resistance for most of its 5000 year existence. We've had inflationary fiat currency for 48 years. Average life of a fiat currency is 27 years. We have unsustainable public debt problems and the 1% have accumulated all the wealth in society. It is not good money, we don't need inflation.
3. That is why you have transaction fees to pay the miners.
4. Bitcoin is infinitely divisible. A scarce asset becoming more scare only makes it more valuable.
5. Bitcoin is the hardest money ever seen competing against government money, the softest money ever seen. Fiat money doesn't stand a chance. Do not trust anyone, verify for yourself. People in here are just expressing their opinions after doing thousands of hours of research on the most important invention to impact the world in their lifetime. It is up to you to do the same and come to your own conclusions.

Lets do some back of the napkin calculation. Bitcoin hashrate is at 80 Ehash/sec. The best miner on the market does 53 Thash/sec. That would give you a 1 / 1,509,434 chance of finding the block first every 10 mins. But that is using the best ASIC hardware available.

Bitcoin is not a product or an app. It is an internet protocol, and a new asset that one day could be used as money. First, the new system has to be bootstrapped from zero to being valuable and highly liquid. Who would accept money that wasn't valuable right? We are still early in the process but it is succeeding exceptionally well. Bitcoin is the fastest, highest rise in value of any asset in human history. Bitcoin is a speculative store of value.

Yeah the SVP thing was a non-starter after further research. People put Satoshi on a pedestal and treat the white paper like a bible. Bitcoin is a great new innovation but he wasn't the best coder and his writings are far below academic level. There is a number of errors in the white paper, and the code has been totally overhauled since. That is the nature of engineering where an initial idea is perfected over time with many minds adding to the project. Satoshi had obviously been thinking about all the issues for a long time, but even he just put this idea out there as it may or may not work. It was just a crazy experiment that took on a life of its own. People seem to want to create a myth of Satoshi of creating some perfect invention out of the box.

You must be new around here. Money is already the religion of the day. We are just monotheists and other people are polytheists. The flaws you think you see are just misunderstandings about bitcoin we all go though on our multiyear journey of understanding Bitcoin. Transaction speeds are instant on higher layers of the tech stack. Bitcoin network is not a payment tool, just as Visa is not a money. All markets are manipulated and are only a function of current market size and liquidity. The issue solves itself with higher prices and more players entering the market as it opens up to institutions. 
The level of risk has more to do your level of initiation than with the asset itself. Everyone thinks new things are risky compare to things that have been around all their life.
A great flippening is approaching.  
More investors flip everyday to realise that quantitative easing, negative interest rates, fractional reserves, the elimination of cash, mass surveillance, currency wars, and inflation are all the frightening experiments, not bitcoin.

Bitcoin is the best performing asset of the last 10 years. The fastest, highest rise in value of any asset in human history. We are at 1% or 2% adoption with asymmetric upside potential. As a hedge against the banking system which completely collapsed in 2008, there is no saving them in the coming recession. 
Bitcoin is the hardest money the world has ever seen, competing against government money the easiest money ever seen. Printed out of thin air and backed by insolvent governments. You either buy bitcoin before your currency collapses or after, you just get more if you buy before.

There are loosely held beliefs and there are strongly held beliefs. People can readily change a loosely held belief when presented with new information. But a strongly held belief like "government money is the only real money" is something they have just accepted all their life.

People have been using money without any financial records for 5000 years, and civil society has functioned well enough. It is only in the last few decades where the state, along with the help of the banksters, have they pushed for total financial surveillance. The encroachment of the surveillance state and the war on cash is what bitcoin is here to fix. If you think the world will fall apart just because we don't have the record keeping that has only recently came into being, then you have fallen for the trap the psychopaths in power want you to think.

You need some way to be provably decentralised. No single actor having control of producing blocks.

The value is based on supply and demand. Supply is constricted by people hodling it, keeping it away from the market. Demand is more people and capital wanting to buy some. Bitcoin is a speculative store of value. It is not trying to be money today as it is only 10 years old and needs to attain value and liquidity first. People buy some to speculate as Bitcoin has the best traits ever seen for a possible form of money and the worlds best chance of achieving sound money. 
Adoption occurs simply by knowledge and understanding spreading which drives demand and therefore price goes up. The earlier you adopt the more bitcoin you can afford. This is just the bootstrapping phase in Bitcoin's life of coin distribution and price discovery. A new system of money will not take hold in less than 20 years from inception.
@_date: 2019-08-16 21:12:56
I don't know. I've heard it said and it seems likely, but I wouldn't know how to verify it. Bitcoin being a monetary asset and priced close to inception is unique. I can't see how anything else has risen over 6,000,000% in 8 years.

Of-course blockchains don't scale. That was the very first response by Hal Finney in the cyberpunks mailing list. It is as true then as it always will be. Bitcoin only works as you can validate from genesis. If you expand throughput in anyway, this initial sync will also expand at an unsustainable pace. If it takes you six months to bootstrap a node, how many people do you think are going to be able to participate? Big blockers are an attack on bitcoin to centralised the system.
Luckily you can gain infinite scalability on higher layers of the tech stack. The Bitcoin network is built to be maximally secure and a decentralised anchor for digital trust. It can be used to hook into for all the user features you want on other layers. Keep your protocols simple and add layers of abstraction on top. This is the way all computer science has been done for 70 years. Why would Bitcoin be any different?

You know you have a negative bias mind don't you? You assume everything is BS until proven otherwise. You are not a technical expert, unqualified to have an informed opinion, so everything that isn't already popular is bollocks so you don't look stupid in-front of other lay people. Well, nobody ever made any money doing what everyone else was doing.
Nothing else has risen over 8,000,000% in 10 years. Manipulators can only move price a small percentage in the short term. Only an increasing number of hodlers can raise the value of an asset that has over $1 billion daily trade volume.
Credit card fraud is giving $8 billion a year to criminals in the US alone, just for you to have the convenience of a technology designed in the 50s shoehorned into the internet age. We all pay for that cost as the banks pass it onto merchants through fees, who in-turn pass it onto us with higher prices for goods and services.
If central banks create their own digital currency, then they compete with the commercial banks each also creating their own monies. (JPM Coin etc). We had this situation previous with private banks issuing hundreds of competing currencies. The issue was solved with having one central bank issue the coin. Is the banking system really going to go backwards and ignore the history of why central banking was created in the first place? Plus bitcoin is a single global currency. No central bank can facilitate global trade better than a bitcoin world can. The separation of money from state is just as needed as the separation of church from state.

There is already a battle going on between the people in power. The elites of this world have formed into 2 camps; those who are desperately holding on to the way things have always been, and those who see the world they are presiding over as unsustainable. Top down centralised control doesn't scale. The people are becoming informed and have access to non-censored information for the first time since the printing press. Control over all the people is no longer a viable game for them to play. 
How this plays out is anyone guess. Your scenario is a possibility. Although it is no longer the powerful against the weak. For every crazed power hungry oligarch, there is another working to release responsibility onto the people. Bitcoin is a ground up emergent phenomenon. Money by the people for the people. 
We can either cower away and live in fear of what may happen to us. Leave the next generation to suffer the same. Or take the opportunities presented to us and use the tools available to change the way the world has operated for thousands of years. Hierarchical governance is suited to small tribal communities. Decentralised power is suited for large colonies. The human spices is global and the internet has made the world far more connected. It is long past the point the adaptation should have been made.

Bitcoin is already optimal. The most efficient way to achieve sound global digital money. There has already been  10 years of study on other ways of doing this, and they all fail by compromising decentralisation. Bitcoin only works because you can verify from genesis using a standard computer. This is the essential element for a decentralised system. 
Any talk of on-chain scaling, high TPS, Turing complete programs, or putting the internet on a blockchain is a load of bollocks. User features can be serviced by higher layers of the tech stack. Bitcoin is the anchor for digital trust. It is already perfectly suited for what is was designed to do. A global settlement layer without any central authority. Secured by the most powerful computer network on the planet.

The point of any money is to store value between the time you earn it and the time you spend it. If it doesn't even do that it is worthless. Gold is not a scarce asset in the universe. The nearest asteroids hold more gold than has ever been mined out here on earth. Investment money is pouring into the possibility of mining those bad boys. It may not be soon but I don't see gold being a viable candidate as a SoV for the rest of my lifetime. Bitcoin is the hardest money ever seen. Of-course it has to prove its store of value properties over many years before anyone would consider using it as a medium of exchange.

True. Things could play out differently. If you can't get all the full nodes to update then you end up with a chain split. One chain that got rolled back and one that still carries the bug. We have also seen multiple times what happens when you fork bitcoin. The market values the most legitimate chain by people holding fork they want and dumping the fake Bitcoin.

Money is the most saleable good. You think an new asset can start from zero and become the most saleable good in just 10 years? ��
It is very much on track. Bitcoin is the fastest, highest rise in value of any asset ever. What faster adoption would look like I cannot imagine.
No copy of bitcoin will be accepted as bitcoin by my node. That is like saying the printing of Zimbabwe dollars is inflating the supply of the US currency. 
Money is an accounting tool to transfer value through space and time. Tens of millions of people are using it, and it has been working for them just fine. Their purchasing power has increased so much so that simply holding for a few years has allowed them to retire. No government money can ever do that.

To have the hardware to pull it off you have already sunk billions into this venture. Wealthy people are wealthy because of a thing called risk management. Nobody is ever 51% attacking bitcoin. It is beyond the risk/reward of even a state actor. 
Even if they somehow succeed in a chain split, the community always have the option to fall back on social consensus. We see the double spend, Core devs puts a patch out that ignores the malicious chain, bitcoin carries on regardless. All the attacker has done is bankrupted themselves to own a worthless digital asset on dead fork that nobody considers to be bitcoin. See, no one is putting up the money for an attack that has almost 0% chance of paying off.

Bigger blocks is ultimately not a scaling "solution" you are just pushing a problem down the road. If you want to become a global payment network you hope one day get to a couple Billion people using Bitcoin. Lets say on average they make a 2 transactions a day. The smallest transaction size is 250 bytes, that means the block size would need to be 6.5 GB to service that many people. 
When you get much beyond 64 MB you risk having syncing issues as you send this data around a global network of nodes and can have unintentional chain splits like we recently saw with Bitcoin SV. The laws of physics and network limitations are real but there will always be some people who insist on magical thinking.
The block size limit is there for a reason, to enforce a fee market on transactions to subsidise miners. The block reward is going away and the network must support itself somehow. In the future I believe there will be consensus to increase the block limit up a little. Only when it is really necessary and within reason.

I believe Bitcoin was a culmination of a lifetime of thinking about the issue of money and little to do with the 2008/2009 financial crash. That may have just spurned Satoshi into putting the idea into practice. He was definitely a skilled cryptographer which used to be quite a niche aspect of computer science. There is a small field of people who work in cryptography and most of those are for intelligence agencies. It is a certain analytical mind that enjoys cryptography which also leads solving complex problems as a hobby.
I think he was a middle aged guy that lived though the removal of gold backing from the US dollar in his formative years. He would of been similar to a lot of gold bugs who really want to see a return to sound money that directed his thinking on the topic over 3 decades. He is no one special, but people can have original ideas within their area of expertise. Some times they go nowhere, sometimes they can change to world.
I was thinking the other day that people often dismiss the idea of Bitcoin as a hoax at first, as it didn't originate from a standard route. All new technologies start in a corporate research lab or from academia. But open source software development, linking random anonymous strangers over the internet is also a new novel way of working. It was bound to throw up new software innovations sooner or later. ‘Bitcoin is of the Internet’

It's the fact banks knowingly launder money and continue to do so regardless of fines. Those cases brought against HSBC for example, involved installing anonymous drop boxes into banks specifically for Mexican drug cartels to deposit suitcases full of cash, and did so for 10 years.

If it wasn't profitable some people would turn their mining machines off, the hashrate would fall, difficulty will adjust so it is profitable for the miners still operating. People will then see that it is profitable to mine again, so turn their machines on and invest more into new equipment starting the whole process over again. Profitability will always tend to zero, with some lead and lag time causing variance in miner profitability.

If you hold money in a savings account it may sit there years not doing anything, but is it still offering some utility to you? Are you using it everyday to transfer value through time? That is all money is, an accounting tool to store value. Bitcoin may not be money today according to everyone in society. But individuality it can be money to us, as we choose to store our earnings in an asset that can never be diluted by governments. Those who do not adopt the hardest form of money available will be out-competed by those who do.

Yes. Money is the most saleable good in society. Nothing is going to pop into existence and be the most saleable good from day one. Do you expect some new asset to start from zero and become a multi-trillion dollar asset without massive volatility for the first few decades of its existence?
No market moves in a linear fashion, or is priced at its true value before people even understand what bitcoin's value proposition is. Bitcoin is a speculative store of value that could one day in the future become money. Expecting it to act like a stable currency before the monetization event is complete is where you are going wrong. Disperse the coins and educate the world first.
When we reach saturation it will be far more liquid than any national currency with deep order books. It is a global currency and not subject to the economy of any single country. With its fixed and transparent supply it will eventually become the most sable form of money there could possibly be. Even harder than gold. A anchor for global trade that is immovable by any political turmoil, so money can return to being a true measuring stick which all assets can be accurately priced against.

Nobody in bitcoin is making any decisions that other people are compelled to follow. Just millions of people making independent decisions and bitcoin is the function of emergent behaviour. Bitcoin is just extremely hard to change. The consensus rules are still the same today as the original release from Satoshi, not because people haven't tried to change them, that is what all the forks of Bitcoin are. But the market rejects them. If some fork really had better qualities than BTC, then that would get the higher market value, the altered version would become the conical version of bitcoin. Your supposed centralised governance can do nothing to stop it.
@_date: 2019-12-12 15:13:50


Decentralised doesn't mean no rules, it means no rulers. Of course a system has rules else it's not a system, it's just random chaos. Governance is changes to rules. Since BTC is backwards compatible with Satoshi's original release with no hard fork, then there has been no rule changes therefore no governance. Only a soft fork which is a tightening of a rule, it is voluntary so you are not compelled to follow.

Most people believe being able to assay the coin supply is far more important than having strong privacy on the base layer. Both would be nice but no technical way of doing so is known. If there was an inflation bug in Monero or Zcash we may not find out for years, or ever, as there is no way to see the transaction amounts you cannot count all the coins. Can you feel confident using a system like that?
Bitcoin is pseudonymous so does not give absolute privacy by default. But if you are careful with coin control and not link your transaction history to your real ID, then it is possible to preserve your privacy. Just takes more effort and use things like coin mixing, avoiding KYC exchanges, and using Lightning Network for everyday transactions. More privacy preserving tools are coming in the future. Also simply having far more users increases your anonymity set. If only a few thousand people are running a privacy coin's protocol, maybe their internet traffic is worth surveilling by intelligence agencies.

Yes it is stupid to spend bitcoin before the monetization event is complete. Money is the most saleable good in society. Nothing is going to pop into existence to be the most saleable good overnight. It will take a generation for knowledge to spread and for people to understand the value of Bitcoin. 
People buy bitcoin today if they feel there is a non-zero chance of it becoming money in the future. Picking up a little bit in-case is catches on is the only sensible action. This creates a self for-filling prophesy as the coins are held by more people the value of the asset rises, attracting greater liquidity, all of which is propelling bitcoin forward to becoming the most saleable good.

A node is either enforcing the original consensus rules or not, if you are outside the consensus rules you are on a forked chain. Forking is fine if there is a contentious issue like segwit. Then both versions of bitcoin are listed on exchanges and the market decides which policy they prefer with their money.
The shit version of bitcoin which kills off possible future development on second layers, and compromises decentralisation with big blocks then gets dumped by everyone which falls to only 2.8% of the real bitcoin's value. Then the losers cry and moan about it for 2.5 years. At no point does a majority of nodes decide what bitcoin is, nor miners, nor developers. The market chooses the conical version of the ledger.

How long new technologies take to reach their full potential is always the hard part to predict. If you think of other major tech like electricity, the internet, or motor cars, they all take ruffly 30 years from inception to wide spread use. 
External factors can also play a major part. How long will people keep believing in a form of money printed out of thin air, backed by a government $23 trillion in debt, and desperately inducing inflation with QE infinity just to avoid default. A banking system that entirely collapsed just 12 years ago and was only saved with a tax payer bail out. A system that was too big to fail is now even bigger and more leveraged.
Individuals can choose to make use of new technologies whenever it is within their means. I've been using Bitcoin instead of a savings account for 20% of my life. Volatility doesn't bother me as it has stayed in a well defined channel of exponential growth. No other asset has performed better of that whole time. Money is primarily a tool to transfer value though time, a medium of exchange is a secondary purpose.

This is misleading as we don't have 121 years before we need a fee market. Once the valuation reaches saturation in say 10/20 years, you cannot expect the price to keep doubling every 4 years to maintain the equivalent security budget from the block reward alone. Even in 10 years people will not feel comfortable storing value in Bitcoin if the future security of the network is seemingly not assured.

Yes, fork the code see if you get consensus. Bitcoin is whatever the majority chooses. No one can speak for the majority. There has been no hard forks of BTC to date.

Well instead of having a central bank attempt to tame the business cycle with monetary intervention, the Austrian school says to allow free markets and individual human action to find emergent order from an organic economy. So instead of expanding and contracting the money supply and setting interest rates, Bitcoin's supply is transparent and fixed, no more than 21 million units will ever be minted. The hardest form of money ever seen. So money can then be the measuring stick which all other assets can be priced against.

"If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks and the corporations which grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered."
As we have seen the 1% now control 90% of all the wealth. The game is over, the working poor and middle class have lost. It's time to play a different game.

If you believe bitcoin will hold its value better than your local currency over the long term, it is still a better money to hold. It doesn't need to moon to be a good store of value, just better than the alternative. 
If the market price rises to quickly in some irrational exuberance then you will likely get just as harsh a correction. That is why you look to the yearly lows for the real value of the asset and not the highs.

Bitcoin doesn't have governance. Fork the code, fork the chain, make any changes you want. The market will decide which version they want by voting with their money. If your change is better and people agree, then that will become the conical version of the ledger. It's an Anarcho-capitalist system.
@_date: 2019-12-10 23:22:34
I don't think it would be the case of a county replacing its currency with bitcoin, more likely a country would choose to back it's currency with bitcoin. Just as countries left the gold standard during the world wars then reestablished later, there's little disruption to people's daily lives. A countries central bank would be quietly accumulating bitcoin initially, then one day they declare a fixed redeemable rate between bitcoin and their local currency. It would instantly give them the most credible monetary policy out of all the countries. People can continue using their paper bills, but would also be able to use bitcoin directly only if they want.

If the price of goods and services is going down and the purchasing power of your savings is increasing, don't you think people will consume more not less? We have been told repeatedly all our lives that inflating the currency incentives spending, but we fail to run this idea past our own basic logic. 
As the price of things in shops are increasing, and people fall deeper into debt, they tend to spend less not more. They try even harder to save and cut back on all but necessities as they scrape by on wages that have stagnated for 40 years. Maybe, just maybe there is an ulterior motive for printing new money all the time. If you repeat a lie enough times people tend to accept it.

Do you believe the banks will give you access to all your money if the internet is switched off? The financial world is far more reliant on the internet than Bitcoin is.

Immutability is an emergent behaviour of bitcoin, not a property of blockchain. Digital scarcity can only be invented once. If you can just create a new digital token then that is the opposite of scarce.
Bitcoin is disrupting the largest market there is; money, one half of every transaction. The hardest form of money ever envisioned will systematically devour all the government fiat money in the world. As that has been the case every time in history when a harder currency has entered a region a softer currency was being used. Do not waste your time with the pretenders, they have no product market fit and their technology is a fraud.

Money is not an app you simply download and use. You cannot throw out all economic principals and expect a new system of money to have formed in just 10 years. Bitcoin must for go though a bootstrapping phase of attaining value, and distribution of coins. We are still early in this price discovery phase and yes it is a speculative growth currency. 
Some of us have been researching bitcoin for many years and have seen nothing but growth and adoption. The Bitcoin network is unstoppable, the properties of bitcoin make it the best form of money ever seen. Of course do your own research, though to some of us, it is not an investment anymore but the safest place to hold your savings. 
A great flippening is approaching.
More investors flip everyday to realise that quantitative easing, negative interest rates, fractional reserves, the elimination of cash, mass surveillance, currency wars, and inflation are all the frightening experiments, not bitcoin.
There is risk everywhere in life, only by studying every aspect and finding where it lies can you mitigate those risks. Depending on your age and circumstance you can have a higher or lower risk tolerance to others. Diversification is to protect wealth, concentration is to grow wealth.

Bitcoin doesn't solve inequality. Doesn't say anything about solving the human condition in the white paper. So long as money is a thing in the world, there will always be large holders and the less well off. The question is if there is a relative benefit to the status quo. 
Most generations have very rigid social mobility. If you are born disadvantage the odds are massively stacked against you. We will live though a fairly unique period of history where wealth will transfer from the disinterested to the curious. Money can flow from the produces of value direct to the consumers without any rent seeking middlemen extracting all the wealth of society. There will absolutely be winners and losers in any disruption. But the reason for succeeding is simply accessing freely available information online, compared to someone's ancestors killed more than someone else's in past global wars.

It is impossible to have a medium of exchange coin that isn't a SOV first. Unless there are people somewhere willing to hold the asset it cannot have any value, and so useless for commerce. MV=PQ. 
A pure exchange token like XRP, if it was actually used, the velocity would approach infinity so the price would approach zero. It is just common sense, nobody would except a currency as payment unless it has value to them first. You think you can just put the cart before the horse?

Bitcoin is past the point of no return a few years ago. It is unstoppable now and will continue producing blocks for as long as the internet exists.

It is far more likely for you to lock yourself out of your bitcoin than having it stolen. Adding complexity is the dangerous element. Just write the 24 words down and have it encrypted with a bip39 passphrase. Then you are just remembering a single passphrase and it's still safe if someone gets the 24 words. A step up in security is a multisig 2 of 3. The hardware wallet is one key, a second key on the computer, and a third backup key stored someplace else.

Nope, definitely could not say the past performance is anything like the tulips bubble. A bubble goes up and crashes to starting value or below, never to return to previous highs.

Then don't use the companies offering payment services in bitcoin. Lightning network is the trustless P2P payment tool. I'm just pointing out there will be many options available. Different use cases for different people. Some people may want the customer service that a company will offer. 
The Bitcoin network itself is the only thing that needs to be maximally decentralised to ensure digital trust without any central authority. To give assurances your bitcoin will never be diluted, and you can hold your savings in a seizure resistant, censorship resistant, non-sovereign currency. If you load up a couple hundred dollars spending money into a centralised service for making easier payments, it's not the end of the world if some failure happens on the higher layers of the tech stack. You can just use a different service.

We are still deep in the experimental stage. We are not expecting the masses to come in and use this technology as it is still beta, with risk of losing money.
It's not like Satoshi released the network code and expected people to use it as money right away. It started at zero, and must attain value before it is usable. 2 or 3 decades is a reasonable amount of time to go though the bootstrapping price discovery phase. Bitcoin is the future of money, anyone can get exposure to the rise in value. We are creating an entirely new global system of sound money to last for hundreds, or even thousands of years. Today, Bitcoin is securing $150 billion of people's money. The mantra is move slow and don't break anything.
The tools being built around bitcoin are being built today to solve future problems. Development time takes years for applications that have never been built before. Bitcoin is not here to serve your needs today, unless you live under hyperinflation or strict capital controls. It is up to you to lower your time preference, and just enjoy the benefit of being involved the best performing asset in all human history. The greatest transfer of wealth of humanity will ever see. Why nitpick about not being ready for general usage today? You are just early.

The removal of the gold backing from the dollar was a temporary emergency measure. 48 years of a currency where the 1% have accumulated all the wealth of society, and backed by a government that is $22  trillion in debt. All fiat currencies have been detrimental to the countries that have tried them. 
If you think hard assets can go to zero you really are economically illiterate. The value of gold and everything has nothing to do with the amount of paper bills you swap for them.

Put all you money into altcoins then if you are so sure of yourself. These scammers who say they have "fixed" Bitcoin by removing the artificial limit on throughput are just preying on computer illiterate noobs. It is not a hardware or network limitation that keeps bitcoin slow, it is 2 variables in the code that are there for a reason. To ensure maximum decentralisation by anyone being able to run a node, plus long term viability to pay the security budget through tx fees as the block reward reduces. If you only learn about bitcoin through shitcoin marketing you will be relying on baseless information. Nakamoto consensus secured through proof of work mining is the only innovation. No other network can ever give the security assurances that Bitcoin gives. We are not building the 21'st century digital economy on some second class technology built purely to make the founders wealthy.

Well, it won't become useful as money until it is a multi trillion dollar asset. You cannot transact billions of dollars of economic activity on an asset that is itself only worth $145 billion. Money is valuable, we didn't trade with rocks in the past, we used gold as it is expensive.

There are plenty of industries that use lot of electricity. Are they going to search every gas station, residence, warehouse, farmhouse, henhouse, outhouse and doghouse in that entire country? Boxmining did a video on Chinese miners a while ago, saying there are lots of small scale operations running out of small mud huts. Mining is permission-less, anyone with access to cheap electricity can setup a rack of ASICs anywhere. 
Millions of people circumvent the great firewall everyday. You can use Tor, VPNs, satellite, and radio connections if necessary. If the firewall was able to block miners it would have been used already.

What is safer is hard to objectively quantify. With the nature of bitcoin being a bearer asset, if you put thousands of bitcoin under the management of one entity, that becomes a honeypot for theft and hackers. Of course Bakkt will have strict operating procedures to secure the bitcoin, but you are introducing counter-party risk compared to holding your own private keys. They are also insured to the tune of $125,000,000. 
Regardless, this is all a legal requirement whenever fund managers are trading other people's money. They are applying old rules to new technology. It may never become an issue, but imagine if one of these "regulated" exchanges were ever compromised for hundreds of billions of dollars worth of bitcoin, we will all laugh at the naivety of Wall St and the problems of centralised points of failure.

No, you would change the algo and brick the hardware. This alone ensures it will never be attempted. The bitcoin network is the most powerful computer on the planet by an order of magnitude. Something like 500 super computers of comparable power. The logistics for an attacker to even create a greater amount of hash-power would take months of construction, consuming the manufacturing base, preventing regular industry from operating.
 Impossible to do in secret, and even if some dystopian future regime took on the task, they would be gambling billions of dollars on hardware that we know will be bricked by a simple algo change. Bitcoin continues because the network is anyone who runs a node, not the miners who are just mercenaries suggesting blocks.

1. Mining pools do not own the hash power directed at them. Each one is made up from thousands of miners all over the world who can switch as simply as updating their config file.
2. Anyone can mine. It is permission-less, Just need cheap electricity and to buy an ASIC. More ASICs just means more bitcoin, but also greater risk from the up front cost.
3. Mining profitability tends to zero so new bitcoin must be sold to pay ongoing costs. This means everyone has access to the new issuance at current market value. 
4. Any advantage of miners being closer to the issuance of bitcoin is offset from the risk of locking up value in hardware that is obsoleted within a couple years.
5. Government's work for us, and they never work well together globally . If a government does not accept our choice of money, there are plenty of other counties who will welcome the tech workers and newly minted millionaires.

Nothing will change for most people. Although you can use bitcoin in a self sovereign way, that won't be the most popular way for the first few decades. When the gold backing was removed from the dollar this was a temporary emergency measure. Fiat currencies always return to their inherent value of zero. The world was always going to return to hard currency. Just this time it will be backed by Bitcoin instead of gold as it has better properties of money, being more easily stored and provably scarce. 
They will hold their bitcoin in a bank, and new paper currency will be redeemable in bitcoin with 100% reserve status. They can continue using all the services they currently do with no noticeable change, only we will have taken the printing of money from the hands of the banksters.

I disagree with how a reddit should be used. People are free to completely ignore any question. If someone takes the time to answer simple basic questions, that is not wasting anyone's time as they are freely choosing to help. There is no resource being consumed by opening a new thread on something that has been asked a thousand times before. No paper is being used on the internet. 
Compare it to a community in meat space. If someone came along to a meetup and knows nothing about the subject, their basic questions would be gladly answered. They wouldn't been turned away to do their own research before they even try to meet up with others in the space. An online community is no different. 
Sometimes using a search function doesn't get you the results you need straight away. Sometime you don't know the specific lingo to ask. A simple question is how people have acquired basic knowledge for as long as humans have communicated. It is never is deserving of a harsh response.
