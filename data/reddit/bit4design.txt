What title do you suggest, seriously. I didn't know what to put as title. 
I just wanted to offer myself to design custom bitcoin giftcards, I don't understand what's the problem with this title, I thought it was funny, it is just ironic I think.

I've put pictures of me with the people I give them to.

Tip me and I will do it as you want.
Just show me a picture of a sketch made on paper or paintbrush as you would like it

I can make as you want, also I don't think there are more languages to write the word bitcoin, but I'll put even klingon, just ask
@_date: 2013-12-20 21:44:31
whatever you offer will be ok

NO! I just give you a design without the codes, with a blank space, the codes or keys you put them yourself. It's really easy with any software wallet.
These are just examples, but I can do them as you like

Hi, I made this, if you want just send me a picture or tell me how you want it.

Hi, I made this to give as a gift to friends and family. I always carry some in my wallet and I can charge them from my android phone app. They get shocked when they see some banknotes with my face or theirs. I tell them I whorship who I want to, I don't want in my money kings, dictators or idols I don't care about.
If anyone is interested, you can send me a picture and tell me how you want it or the words you want on it, and I will do it for a tip. Contact me here or through gmail/xmmp(otr) to that same username. You will just have to add your own QR codes, but that will be really easy, you can just export them from any wallet software and paste it on top of the image with whatever program you want (paint, gimp, photoshop...), or just write the keys in the 2 blank spaces
I will give away one to my family on January 3rd, the day bitcoin started on 2009 I think. On the back I wrote the conditions, they will have to wait 4 years to spend it and they will have to give up smoking tobacco 2 years before :) nice motivation, I hope bitcoin rises in value
