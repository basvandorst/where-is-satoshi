Thank you, that's an interesting service.  It seems to me it can be used in place of the state copyright system to prove earliest ownership of property, including intellectual property.  I.e. you make a record of the original work and archive it, release a slightly modified version, you are forever able to prove you hold the earliest public record of the work.
Do I have it wrong?

The Fed is trying to end QE with interest rates already at zero. Let's guess how that's going to work out for those holding cash.

Nice article. I've been interested in these thing since here in the US we are headed for capital controls soon too.
The Itanian student story sgornick mentioned here in the comments is interesting too.

Spent the day looking into BC's signing feature. I came away with the impression it was enough for contracts. Basically Party 1 sends the potential buyer a message/email with the Bitcoin address to send the payment and the account the payment will be applied and signs it. Party 2 verifies the message, saves it, sends the payment and when it becomes part of the blockchain is proof, altogether avoiding any possible 'he-said she-said' by either party.

I think he was being sarcastic. If you can facilitate the transactions, there is money to be made. You need to find connections with people outside the country who want the non-rials currency you'll be accepting and mail the money to them. When they get the money they will transfer the bitcoins. Obviously you need to try and find outside people you can trust, people that have cultivated a reputable reputation.
There's a guy/girl everyone keeps recommending around here. You can try him/her. You could also ask on IRC's  channel for people recommendations. The bot there also keeps track of user reputation levels and can assist you.

Well, pretending that history doesn't exist and the innumerable examples of what happened to all the preceding nation states that were doing exactly what we are doing now, we still have the following.
Interest rates have been nailed to the floor at zero percent for four years now. Bernanky has promised they will remain so at least through '14.  The reason they can no longer be allowed up is the debt is so high that even were it allowed to just 10% (it needed 18% to correct the market in the '80s) the total revenue the US brings in through its taxes is not enough to cover the interest owed.
We have the recent headlines of the laws being passed to stop the wealthy leaving and taking their wealth by methods such as demanding huge percentages of it and threatening they can never return. We have the lowering reporting laws, with the amounts you're allowed to leave with being lowered lower and lower.  We have the Hispanic segment of the population now leaving in greater numbers than are entering the US. We have the Chinese, who hold the largest portion of our debt, now starting to leave because the taxes are lower back in China.
We have the new international mandatory reporting laws that all world banks of US citizens anywhere must report their holdings. The US is one of the only countries in the world that demands its citizens pay taxes on income earned outside the US.
Why all this and more? Because the US can no longer meet its obligations. Its only means out at this point is to try and tax more from all sources.  Obamacare was pronounced by the courts themselves as just another tax.  The increased US corporation taxes going into effect next year are being called Taxaggeddon by the press. People are fleeing these burdens and the brutality ramping up at the boarders reflects the boarders restrictions being put in place.
If you didn't know this stuff by now it's not because it's not out there, it's because you didn't want to know.

You need to remember that the gold and silver equivalent value was stored and kept for every one and could be redeemed at any time.
@_date: 2012-10-26 06:45:07
As I'm sure you know, precious metals are a store of wealth.  In more words, when gold/silver 'go up' it's not that they are so much as going up, as fiat is dropping out from under. An ounce of gold buys you the same amount of stuff today as it would have in 1900 and it's the fiat losing 98% of its value over that span that makes it appear to have gone up in value.
What it says on a $20 Liberty note (warehouse receipt) is that the bearer has exchanged it for 2 troy ounces of silver at .999 fine. At any time the bearer can return the receipt and get the two troy ounces.
To cover costs of vault storage (which was transparent), you paid a bit more at the time than a troy ounce was worth.  I remember the amount was small enough that I don't think he was even doing it for any profit.
Now do you see why it must have been something like a kangaroo court to find him guilty of said 'crimes'?

This is going to happen regardless, even if the state has to false flag it.

But, also throwaway-o, I want to add, I think we need to remember to make an effort not to drive away or alienate even statists from using bitcoin.  We need all users. When we see someone responding out of fear it may be best just to agree that we don't agree and let it go at that.
I mean, as long as they are using bitcoin, things are going down the road we want, so we come out ahead even if we cannot get them to see our views.  I think you agree?

Fiat is up and some think, 'hmm maybe I should be holding dollars' so they are selling. But the dollar is only artifically up for the coming US Election. After that it's going down and people will be thinking the opposite.
@_date: 2012-10-26 02:45:50
No, the crux of the issue is that nation states can and do brutally protect currency monopoly. When bitcoins become enough of a threat the 'laws' will be changed to attempt to exterminate it.
They'll likely say something like, 'Bitcoins are a tool enabling terrorism and used by terrorists and present too great a threat to this country. It is for this reason they will now be illegal.'
I don't mean to scare anyone away, I just think we need to be realistic and know what the nation states are going to do so that we are ready and expecting.
And, keep in mind that even with passage of such 'law(s)' in particular nation states, they still can only drive Bitcoin down to a person to person level because there's just too much reason to keep using a money that is international, decentralized, non-inflating and requires no middle-man.

Well, keep in mind the guy in the canadian student thread said 'everyone' in Iran saw this coming and converted their savings into dollars and euros a while back. And while that can't be literally true, there might be a lot of dollars and euros floating around in there.

Also, a company not paying taxes has a lot more capital to put towards gaining market share from those companies that still do.

And to summarize the article, it's the idea to replace the traditional contract system (which requires a third party enforcement - which comes with a slew of problems and costs, as we are learning), with a reputation based contract system.
The former's 'security' is done after the contract while the latter's 'security' precedes the contract (following the axiom: an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure).

Have you checked if there is someone local who regularly sells? It could become a regular thing where you send him/her the cash and they transfer the bitcoins. You're not likely to find a lower overhead plus privacy.

Ok, I can see how GPG can be used to create formal contracts. And, I can see how there's a bit of incentive for the parties not to default on them after putting a time investment into it.  But, what I don't see, yet, is what having one is good for after this.
How does the reputation get involved and how can it be affected in any way?  I see how the GPG finger-print becomes entwined with a bitcoin address or vanity address, but how does reputation work into it?  I see two:
1) The number of bitcoins of an address can indicate a history of business success.
2) The number of bitcoin transactions associated with an address can indicate a history of business success.
Are there others I missed?  Can we come up with more?

They were 'warehouse receipts' and at anytime could be exchanged for the represented value that was held in storage for just that purpose.

In the US they are massively pumping dollars into circulation to make the economy look healthy for the coming elections.  They do this everytime. Two months after the election the markets will crash back down and things like metals and Bitcoins will jump up.
For them it's all about appearances.

I keep my wallet in a hidden disk volume via [TrueCrypt] ( Then I can disconnect from the net and mount it when I need to access my wallet and unmount it when done.
I'm going to see if I can keep the encrypted volume disk image in my DropBox so that when I start using my iPad/iPhone around town, I can access it with the help of the app Disk Decipher.
I've also felt it a good investment to get the key logging confounder [KeyScrambler] ( for my desktop in case I pick up a Trojan w/ a key logger.
I haven't yet found an app to scramble key logging on the iPhone/iPad, which I feel will be in demand soon, for any programmers out there looking for a nitch to fill.

It didn't seem like gloom to me at all. It was just laying it out plainly, and useful in that it will help ameliorate the surprise later because people were made aware of the situation and have had time to think about it and build more informed decisions appropriately. People react better when when a bit prepared and understand a bit more how things work and why it is things are happening.
It may not have given you what you didn't already know, but I think it does for the other 95%.
