So is the goal to sell what you have when it goes back up and then buy again when it goes back down like right now? Or should I just hold whatever I buy into bitcoin?

If I buy $100 worth but it won't be in my Coinbase account till Sunday will I still be making money if it goes up even if it's technically not showing in my coinbase account?
