I don't think only deflationary currency is the answer either. But I don't think *inflationary* currency is a necessity. We'd be fine having cryptocurrencies as well as a perfectly stable fiat legal tender (imo).
I agree that economically representing externalities with taxation is a possible way to address some of these issues also.

I really don't understand what people making these arguments think the US dollar is. At least Bitcoin doesn't frivolously print/digitally create an endless supply of currency and lend it out at a 9:1 margin rate.

The issue is that spent money doesn't necessarily equal created value. People end up throwing away money on stuff of little genuine value which has staggering external costs, instead of making more careful choices, when legal tender is inflationary. This notion of economic prosperity being measured in the total number of goods moved rather than the total *net* useful value of goods moved is wrong thinking derived from a broken paradigm of consumerism that's destroying the planet. More consumption does not create the best society, particularly given the level of health and economic consequences that are now being caused by pollution created from making all of this useless crap that people buy. If people are more hesitant to spend money, then it forces businesses to make products that actually have more valuable benefit to people relative to the true cost of production.
edit: to clarify, I don't think doing away with fiat legal tender is what needs to happen. I just think having the prime currency as fundamentally *inflationary* is damaging, within the context of current currency, economic, and environmental conditions. Having a US dollar that's stable, alongside deflationary cryptos, to my mind at least, should work better than the current currency system.
