I think such action isn't warranted. Today you are creating artificial demand by misleading GoCityHotels.com.  GoCityHotels.com. necessary to provide technical equipment for receiving Bitcoin and it is an additional investment. If GoCityHotels.com. agree to accept Bitcoin and new customers won't appear GoCityHotels.com decide that using BTC was fail.

I'm pleasantly surprised! I always thought that Ashton Kutcher is an ordinary actor  whose interests are hangouts rather than innovations. 
No wonder he played Steve Jobs in the movie "jOBS".

P.S.  I've never thought that Akon is interested by Bitcoins. It would be nice if we'll be able to buy Akon's albums using BTC
