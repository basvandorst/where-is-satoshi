I don't believe that 67% number, just because progressive collapse is much more complicated than a single number. Once you have parts of the building collapsing they can bring the rest down even when the rest is structurally sound.
It did actually get hit by quite a bit of aircraft and building debris. 
The twin towers were built to survive wind loads, but not while severely weakened. It's also worth noting that wind loads are lateral and loads from the buildings' weight are vertical, so it's a totally different set of stresses.
The buildings were designed for an impact from a 707 or smaller, unfueled. The empire State building was hit by a lost b-17 coming in for landing in the fog, so designers assumed a similar set of conditions but with an airliner available at the time. The actual planes were the much larger 767s, with much of their fuel still on board. 
My impression was that the van bombing might have been enough to take down a tower if it was done in another section of the parking lot closer to the foundations.  The explosion punched through a huge area on three or four floors. 
Your source states that no high rise has collapsed from fire, but they fail to mention that other high rise fires started from a point and spread outward, not lighting an entire floor on fire at once and destroying significant amounts of the insulation that would prevent weakening for a normal fire duration. I'm pretty sure the micro thermite was later disproven, but I don't have a good source for that because I'm on my phone.

Yeah, lunar orbital velocity is less than Earth's so you do have a better shot at getting something to survive the landing. The no atmosphere thing still makes things hard.
I like the impact crater idea, very Kerbal!

From wikipedia, referring to the lasers used for lunar rangefinding: "At the Moon's surface, the beam is about 6.5 kilometers (4.0 mi) wide." So that's probably out unless you can get the laser into lunar orbit.
You'd probably spend as much ensuring that the key survives a hypervelocity impact (the kinds of speeds where metals flow like liquids and small objects just vaporize into nothing) as you would building a landing system, but there might be a middle ground between the two that's relatively cheaper so I'll give you that one tentatively.
Geosynchronous lunar orbit (selenosynchronous?) isn't really a thing, but you could put the key at the L1 [lagrangian point]( and it would be both behind the moon and far enough away nobody could read it without sending something up there anyway.

I'm pretty sure this is an Indian Space agency launch, if anyone was wondering. There's a subreddit for information on tech and future launches at @_date: 2017-08-30 03:06:49

Not to be confused with the competing update, "spoon," or the future merge, "spork."
We don't talk about knife.

I used one of these ATMs to get bitcoin once. You set up an account beforehand, then verify your ID when you use the machine. Then you go to your account online and access your coinbase wallet, where you can send it just like any other bitcoin. I sent it to my personal wallet. 
Between fees and unfavorable exchange rate I lost more money than I would like, but I've since doubled my original investment (before fees) and then some so YMMV.

It's better than doing nothing with the heat, but it's not as efficient as something like a heat pump. And it doesn't really help you in summer unless you live in Antarctica, lol

A lithium mine basically looks like [evaporation ponds]( or a [pump building]( a lot of "lithium mine" pictures are actually copper mines. You have to transport gas halfway around the world every time you fuel up your car, but the lithium only gets moved when the car is built and the car is destroyed. For the lifetime of an electric car you still end up coming out ahead when you [take everything into account]( Some manufacturers are also avoiding rare-earth magnets through different motor designs, so that's not a given either. 
I mean, it would be better if we didn't expend power to extract lithium or have to take up space for evaporation ponds, but it's way better than the alternative.

Hey, don't knock on steam turbines. We still use them because they work super well! 
Powering the with coal, on the other hand...not so great.

Buy "buy BTC" license plates! Just imagine how much they'll be worth when everyone owns BLP.

Wait, what? You have heard of FDIC insurance, right? Any FDIC insured bank will reimburse your funds in case there's a run on the bank and they can't get all the cash together right when everyone needs it. Your bitcoin could lose 100% of its value tomorrow and it's not protected by federal insurance at all. Banks also allow people to buy stuff like houses, start or expand businesses, and do all kinds of stuff that keeps the economy running. You should think of Bitcoin as more like stock or any other high-risk investment rather than like a bank.
That said, there are a lot of shitty Banks. If you do use a bank, I recommend a credit union where the bank customers have more control over the bank and the bank isn't just trying to nickel and dime you with fees. If you're not in the US or Europe and your banks/government works different then the above paragraphs also may not apply.

Yeah, I definitely muddled some stuff together in there, you're correct. I was more reading to the "Bitcoin is safer than putting your money on a bank" part, which is pretty much as true as putting your dollars in a safe under your bed (disregarding that you can keep your keys in multiple places in case of house fire or whatever). Exchanges aren't regulated the same way banks are, so although it's similar conceptually it's much less safe than a traditional bank.

I bought a little bit of Bitcoin for the first time today, came on here and was pleasantly​ surprised I had accidentally bought the dip! I'm off to a good start haha

Well, you could have a ton of pissed off users (because they can't sign up) and none of their money or some pissed off users (because they have a problem and can't get customer service) and lots of their money. I would be surprised if a company picked the former. 
Not that I'm excusing them for poor service, but you can't blame them for wanting to be popular.
