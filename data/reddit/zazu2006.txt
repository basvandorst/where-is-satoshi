odd like 3 years ago the economist was talking about it... I guess I am on the fringe.

The Economist is a huge publication. It has been called the best english language magazine publication.

Except it isn't a reserve currency because it doesn't hold its value against other currency from day to day, much less in times of crisis...
It isn't very liquid either.

But is it fanboy resistant...

I had taken time to look up info on each metal and wrote a long response to this before my comp crashed. If this is a serious question, because you have avoided every science class since grade school I will rewrite my finding.  However, I think you are being confrontational because nobody that has managed to get online can be as obtuse as you seem to be.
@_date: 2018-05-23 11:05:41
Don't bother. I have been saying this for years and all I get are downvotes...

No shit.  Rocks are straight up better for many things too. However, if you combine the properties of gold in a single element, say.... gold, it is more valuable than other things.

Worry not! It is normal, possibly a bit archaic, but normal. By using your vocabulary you are doing ~~gods~~ work.  But seriously, using precise words correctly is good.

If they are transacting they are consumers... Not of "bitcoin" but of something. facepalm facepalm.

The circle jerk on here is so fucking strong it could rip a mans cock clean off.  Honestly, the dude is right.  Bitcoin is fun for speculating and good for buying black market shit, but is less liquid than cash and more volatile than cash. Also, if shit goes tits up like half these doomsday dollar crumbling people are saying it will you won't be worried about bit coin because in all likelihood you will have to be worried about band of roving thugs a la Mad Max and quite frankly they aren't going to want your 1's and 0's.
@_date: 2016-01-05 14:25:48
One does not manufacture gold... Gold can be used for industrial purposes.  The current market infrastructure supports gold and gold is very liquid at the spot price.  Bitcoin is fun but viewed as funny money to most.
@_date: 2016-01-19 16:36:26
Bitcoin is not unique in its "uniqueness." As far as its security and robustness... well I simply can not talk to that. Lets hope its future is brighter than its past.
@_date: 2016-01-19 02:21:44
This is a question I find myself asking constantly.  I can't find any retailers or transactions that I want to perform in bitcoin so for me it is just a weird commodity that sit there waiting and wanting to be used with no place to go.
@_date: 2016-01-19 15:07:55
There have been thousands of currencies that have come and gone.  Would anyone be surprised if the first serious crypto died?  All things do come to an end at some point. 
I am not saying now is that time but it will come.

Ok Ill bite, why is it superior
@_date: 2016-01-05 23:02:37
Keep drinking the koolaid my man... I am going to work, live within my means, and keep using the dollar.  Bitcoin is really only useful for black market transactions within a country, or for speculation.  I haven't seen any other real life applications.  I live in the largest city in my state and there isn't any place locally that will take my bitcoin as payment. That is the reality of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-01-19 05:16:48
I think you replied to the wrong comment.
@_date: 2016-01-19 20:21:55
Gold easily workable non reactive metal with favorable electrical properties.  While I agree that is mostly a store of value, at least it is a physical object that has actual utility.   As far as the end being nigh... well the dollar has been rising in value again for quite some time. The dollar is a reserve currency and while the oil market has something to do with it you have to consider that all other commodities markets are also struck to the dollar. China would have nearly as much to lose if the dollar lost value as well because most of debt that they hold is in dollars.  
I have had people for 20 years tell me that this is it, its all over but the crying.  The cycle happens and there is a downturn and they say see I was right, there is no coming back then when the economy rights itself they say well next time we are all fucked for sure...  No democratic top ten economy has imploded like you are predicting, Japan would be the closest with its "lost decade" and by all accounts the real reason for that is the fact that Japan has seen near zero population growth and that stagnates economies.   
In short the dollar is where the dollar is going to be for at least the mid term future (20-50 years).  If the only thing bitcoin is hinged on is the destruction of the dollar and most likely the collapse of what would be the failed US state, then well, I guess I am not on board.  
Ill hold my bitcoin I mined back in 2013 until I find something I want to do with them or until they are worthless I guess.
TLDR LOL US dollar isn't going to fail, and even it does, the US will be a failed state and you wont have to worry about bitcoin because you will be living in a mad max style distopian future.

The public is paying that bill. Similar to welfare.

I guess investing in shiny monopoly money just doesn't seem like a good investment to the public right now.

This.. I just flipped a house from the 50's... 60 amp service 1 story 910 sq ft no central air, 1 stall detached garage. It was a two bedroom and the original owner had 2 kids.  Life has gotten more expensive but better.
@_date: 2015-07-27 17:57:45
Well it kind of has to be top down... Individuals and even corporations have little to do with determining the reserve currency.  A reserve currency is chosen by being, first and foremost a stable store of value. It doesn't have to be the most valuable, just one of the most stable.  Second it needs a high volume of transactions, thus being very liquid asset at or very near that stable price.  The liquidity will always be an issue because with bitcoin you are forever dependent on not only an internet connection but you are at the mercy of the speed of conformation of payments (double spending is an issue).  Fiat has had these issues as well but, there is a reason why people don't take checks anymore.
Also I just used my anecdote about 9 years ago just as an example this debate has been going on since the 1940s when the dollar became the dominant reserve except then it was the Mark, the Pound, and the Franc.
@_date: 2015-07-27 15:30:41
That is because computers even then had way more utility than bit coin... oh you live if the rural US and you want to use your internet funny money on anything not online... not going to happen.
@_date: 2015-07-27 15:36:56
Take a deep, deep breath.  When I was an undergrad in econ 9 years ago they were crowing about how the euro, the yuan, the IMF basket currency and 100 other things were going to replace the ever crumbling dollar.  Prognosticators will prognosticate.
@_date: 2016-02-10 14:20:09
Honestly Id sell you an option to buy 1000 bitcoin at $4000 at any point in 2020 for like $1000. Honestly less... which would put my guess at less than .1%.
@_date: 2016-02-10 14:03:23
Hell I check in regularly to see how you funny money people are doing and I didn't know about it.  So even as a fringe community member it didn't reach me.

ehh when I was in Spain 05-06 there were more 500s in circulation in the country than 5s.  Of course you never saw one.  The is a lot of drug money that flows through Spain and the 500 euro note does help facilitate it.  The 1000 and 500 dollar bill were done away with for the same reason in the US.

@_date: 2015-09-14 05:22:45


There, because everybody is butthurt about the word fiat... In economics a fiat currency is a basically a worthless chit or a pile of 1's and 0's in this case that people have decided that has value even though the object (real or virtual) has no intrinsic value itself.
@_date: 2015-09-14 01:39:21
Dude bit coin is fiat... virtual but still fiat. 
Hey cunts I am an economist, here is the article from wikipedia.
Treatment in economics[edit]
In monetary economics, fiat money is an intrinsically useless object or record that is widely accepted as a means of payment.[3] In some micro-founded models of money, fiat money is created internally in a community making feasible trades that would not otherwise be possible, either because producers and consumers may not anonymously write IOUs, or because of physical constraints.[7][8]
@_date: 2015-09-14 05:43:36
I thought bitcoin was a currency at heart, not a ponzi investment vehicle...
@_date: 2015-09-14 17:42:11
Did you read any of what I put down.  Fiat money is an intrinsically useless object or *record* (paper money or virtual bitcoin are prime examples) that is widely accepted as a means of payment. Fiat money is created internally in a community making feasible trades that would not otherwise be possible.  This is every currency.  The barter system is basically the only way you aren't going to be using fiat.
@_date: 2015-11-30 20:29:33
Here is the thing. Bitcoin is fiat.  It has no intrinsic value the only things that gives it value is its scarcity which is governed by they difficulty of mining and a social contract that they have value.  The idea that because a state doesn't control it doesn't make it inherently better than a state controlled fiat.
