You got an answer?
@_date: 2018-01-05 09:13:42
That's quite cheap. Where are you based?

Well, we all certainly hope he is wrong on this one. Lol.

I think we have found great resistance at this level. I don't see it going much lower.
@_date: 2018-01-05 12:00:48
Wait at least a year. Then whine.
@_date: 2018-01-30 00:08:41
Yeah, that's what I intend to do, because lately I have just been feeling like checking up helplessly on a baby in an incubator, just hoping it will get stronger rather than weaker...
@_date: 2018-01-16 11:39:02
Yep. Still up 30% since December 1st.
@_date: 2018-01-25 11:43:38
Better say "you should receive it in a couple of days" so as not to hurt your credibility.

I'm a heavy BTC supporter. I don't care about BCH. Stating that it is useless as payment method is just being real about it. I may love my mini dog but I know he's useless as a shepherd.

Volatility seems to be much lower nowadays than in the past. It takes at least 24 hours between checks to see any minor differences.

That's nice, even though BTC is useless as a payment method.
@_date: 2018-01-26 00:43:27
You were lucky to sell your BCH at 3K. As times goes on that number seems further and further away for it.
@_date: 2018-01-21 12:50:10
How is BCH less secure than BTC?
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:55:07
So, like every other single trading market ever.

These guys made their fortunes on the traditional banking system. Of course they will dismiss anything radically different. It's basic cognitive dissonance.
@_date: 2018-01-04 13:50:23
Is it still profitable to mine BTC at home?
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:53:34
Rumours cause dips and crashes in all markets all the time. Irrationality is consubstantial to them.
@_date: 2018-01-03 11:48:00
Nope. They go up from where people are standing. Just like BTC.
@_date: 2018-01-02 14:42:10
Ok, so lightning is already here, but when will it make a noticeable difference? Particularly for layman users who just want to buy a cup of coffee with BTC and without paying ridiculous fees?
@_date: 2018-01-26 00:39:01
Useless as a payment method, nobody said worthless.
@_date: 2018-01-01 14:41:43
Simply leave your private keys to whoever you want to own it after you pass away.
@_date: 2018-01-21 13:06:11
That is all true but didn't mean transactions in BCH are less secure.

You're obviously a troll and I love you.
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:07:59
They're forced to lie since they know customers will come asking to invest in BTC, which they don't offer and thus they have to dissuade them with shitty arguments like those.
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:04:22
You can always memorize your private keys. People have memorized the whole Bible, learning a string of characters is not that hard but we don't even try.

What's that? Couldnt read ya cuz Amber is distracting me with all the cock sucking.
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:25:34
Does a wallet that supports segwit allow for noticeably less time and lower fees than others?
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:17:23
I see, however Visa or MasterCard are definitely not cheaper. I'm a merchant and their fees range from 4% all the way up to 15% or even more depending on several conditions. That can be a lot of money particularly for larger amounts, in which BCH fees wouldn't be affected.
@_date: 2017-12-01 11:23:57

@_date: 2017-12-24 09:03:32
I meant you can register them and save them but ALSO memorize them so that even if you lose your paper or ledger you can still count on your brain.

@_date: 2017-12-10 11:41:23
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:18:09
So why don't we have that on BTC instead of the ridiculous slowness and high fees?
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:22:51
Lol. That's why you scroll and jump directly to the cowgirl. ��
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:23:41
Mexican here, Spanish is my first language. The order of the adjective varies greatly. For example, in English you'd say "good example", but in Spanish there's a subtle difference between "buen ejemplo" and "ejemplo bueno". The latter would be more emphatic.
PS. Notice also, how the adjective "bueno" loses the O at the end when it's placed before a word beginning with a vowel.
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:15:38
But will it bend like Amber does?
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:12:04

Sure, but that's only better towards building BTC awareness.

Lol, my dad also finally began to act on the investment advice I gave him long time ago. Not on BTC actually but on something else he had dismissed. It's like the success of BTC gave me credibility.

Can someone enlighten me as to why don't all exchanges simply implement segwit if it's so good and needed for the future of BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-01 11:20:17
25 Bitcoin? Man this must be 2010 or you must be filthy rich.

@_date: 2017-12-26 13:20:16
Why isn't segwit adopted fully right away if it's the solution we need?
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:36:03
If so, how can anyone argue that BCH is shit when at least they already have a fully implemented, albeit not perfect, solution?
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:55:18
I'm very pro BTC but this is ridiculous. Only BCH would work in this case.
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:00:50
Isn't the Ledger somewhere around 100 bucks? Don't spend more than 10% your BTC worth in a wallet...

Just forget about it. Don't even follow the news. Check back in one year. We'll be closer to 100k.

This. When Reed Hastings created Netflix in 1997 he had the vision that movies would be streamed. It took more than 10 years before they got to that point but now everyone streams everything. And everyone wishes they would have bought shares of Netflix back in the day. We are just beginning!
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:01:46
I don't have any idea but BCH Is around 3K and Gold is at about 300. So they're not worthless.
@_date: 2017-12-09 09:38:24
I'm pretty sure it's blockhain.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:44:33
A better example is "perro grande" means "big dog" but "gran perro" means "great dog". 
Come to think of it, even "better example" is a great example. "Better example" would be "mejor ejemplo" but "ejemplo mejor" would be "best example". 
@_date: 2018-08-28 08:29:46
6,800 + 12,000 = 18,800 not 20k. Many people bought at that level. It was exactly when everybody thought moon was real and those were the millions who drove it to beyond 20k.

Like any purchase it is a buying funnel. This will be the conversion step for many who may have started their process some time ago.
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:17:51

@_date: 2017-11-30 09:56:24

@_date: 2017-11-30 13:07:19
It still helps in order to make BTC a household name.
@_date: 2017-11-30 09:44:05
Some won't, some will. The latter are those who interest us.
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:52:09
Yeah, when you are a long time holder any dip is still 1000% earnings over your initial investment.

I know some guys who will invest their wives then. XD
@_date: 2017-11-30 09:40:14
Yes, I agree it will be a gradual raise but bear in mind there are a lot of "warm" users out there who got their accounts months ago and never bought anything. This episode will give them the extra push they needed. We must remember that buying into BTC is like any other purchase funnel, for most people it's a process, and for many it's a process that began months ago and will turn into a conversion with events like this TV show.
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:23:27
Typical noob mistake to panic about "crashes" and "corrections".
Any time the FUD begins to set in, just remember where we were 6 months ago.
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:10:56
I agree with everything in this post but feel the need to mention that I have read a lot of warnings about an upcoming "correction" or even "crash". They talk about BTC's value going to 5K as if it were the end of everything. Let's all bear in mind that if BTC "crashes" tomorrow to 5k, it would still be a 500% gain in a Year to Date basis. They key word as always is: HODL. Even with the large swings, don't try to get rich instantly, good things come to those who wait. If you buy now and sell in 5 years, even after a huge "crash" you will have still won massive returns compared to the present. That's a great investment in my book. Don't worry about "corrections" or "crashes", worry about the long term trend. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:28:25
Totally agree. Most pseudo experts go around saying "never buy at all time highs". That BS. Old rules don't apply for BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-30 09:42:01
I agree, but any publicity is great publicity, and all media attention helps grow the user base. I know many of us got into BTC after it made headlines for being used in all sorts of criminal activities, none of which we have ever done.
@_date: 2019-10-11 11:55:45
Just add 4% on top of the bills of those paying with cards.

@_date: 2017-11-30 04:24:50
More like several guys... Shame on them. 
Rule of thumb: Never invest what you can't afford to lose and with that, you will never have to sell at a loss. Just HODL and wait for the next bull.

Hold you breath and think as hard as you can, visualize it going green. Do that for 10 minutes straight and it will happen. That's how we go to 20k last year.

Not necessarily "unproductive", they're still a means of transportation and much more important, they are a status symbol which is high in the list of necessities of many people. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 21:33:15
I see your point and I want to agree but "Supply comes first" is not some sort of economic rule that designates success. Many things have high demand and no supply like a cure for cancer, for example. And many other things have been offered (supplied) just to die in oblivion, like 3D televisions.

Unfortunately I reckon it'd be almost impossible to find exchanges where all those or even most of those forks exist, right?
@_date: 2018-11-28 09:15:20
I agree, but in order to short there has to be a large, stable market, much like the stock market, and this is just the push for stability we need. They will make money shorting but also the other way around, and this kind of things give BTC the credibility it needs to position itself. It is better to be there to be manipulated than to not be there at all.
@_date: 2018-11-21 11:06:33
What wallet do you recommend to turn my paper wallet into current BTC?
@_date: 2018-11-21 21:28:31
This is actually very useful, thanks for sharing. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 13:16:06
It also can simply never recover. This theory going around that everything low must eventually go up is ridiculous.
@_date: 2018-11-26 04:55:53
I never said it is doomed. I say it just as possible for it to not recover as for it to do so. Everything is possible, not just for it to go up. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 11:04:43
The problem with these quotes is they are referring to the stock market or at least shares of major corporations. Those are not gonna disappear and if they're low they're bound to go high later. But BTC is nothing like that. It could very well be worth zero next week.
@_date: 2018-11-20 13:40:46
Nobody can be an expert on this.
