The block size is already in place and was put there by Satoshi Nakamoto.

All this shitalking about the rapist is only making him more popular!

What a difference between the two sides. The BU side believes that the miners are in charge, and the Core side believes that the users are in charge. I think I'll choose "users are in charge" over a handful of big miners in China.
I don't see how the two sides can "compromise" when they have such different philosophical ideas of what Bitcoin is.
@_date: 2017-03-17 00:36:06
The devs deployed SegWit, a capacity increase to 2MB, months ago! The community has deployed it, but it's now up to the miners to activate it.
@_date: 2017-03-17 00:58:24
 SegWit does that....
@_date: 2017-03-17 00:37:08
It's done that before. It'll go down again - nothing goes parabolic and doesn't crash afterwards.

Price is everything. It is an efficient signal of the system's health that combines a multitude of factors - ones that you probably aren't even aware of.

No because Bitcoin is the current set of rules being run by the economic majority of nodes and businesses.
@_date: 2017-03-17 00:28:42
Just ask the Bitcoin exchanges and companies running if they run a BU node.

It's useless with these people... they think hashpower is magic and can turn an altcoin into Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-17 00:40:28
They're all concern trolls. Very frustrating.

And Core has the major disadvantage that it isn't a cohesive organization that can spend a lot of money on PR to correct the misconceptions and lies being deliberately spread by Roger Ver's PR team.
@_date: 2017-03-19 09:32:41
What are you implying? That somehow Core developers got the exchanges to issue the joint statement?
@_date: 2017-03-17 00:39:02
Is Domino's trying to be censorship-resistant money?
@_date: 2017-03-17 00:44:29
But that isn't what BU is proposing. That want to hardfork when they get 75% hashpower without consideration to what the rest of the nodes in the community are running, and they want to call themselves Bitcoin. That is the problem.
@_date: 2017-03-11 04:20:53
But the evidence contradicts everything you're saying. Bitcoin continues to utterly dominate the cryptocurrency space. Adoption continues to grow. The price has been steadily climbing for well over a year (it's up from around $450 a year ago). That "other" sub continues to be seen by the greater community as a conspiracy-ridden shitfest.
Are you sure you understand what's going on?
@_date: 2017-03-29 06:48:35
It's an entirely different kind of flying.
@_date: 2017-03-11 04:17:25
Great example, thanks!
@_date: 2017-03-17 00:42:12
Who cares? Altcoins pump and altcoins dump. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 00:30:47
SegWit would provide immediate relief...
@_date: 2017-03-14 05:50:37
 &gt; It probably comes from a barage of alt coins trying to disrupt bitcoins progression by paying social media influencer companies.
This is **definitely** the case and that's why OP out to lunch.
@_date: 2016-01-18 07:29:31
No one is saying "all praise" to the Core team. You are arguing against a straw man. The Core dev team does happen to have a reasonable scaling proposal that minimizes forking risks and DOS attack risks. These guys are the experts who have been living, breathing and eating Bitcoin for the last several years. It isn't giving "all praise" to recognize that. 
I would rather have a heavy lift rocket built by an experienced team than by a hastily assembled new team.

You're crazy. He's a shining light in the space and we're lucky to have him.

There was never a hardfork to roll back stolen funds. What Ethereum's community is considering will destroy the entire rationale for their existence.
@_date: 2017-01-27 03:29:36
Luke stands true to his convictions, you have to give him that. But this proposal is... silly.
@_date: 2016-10-11 06:41:16
This is what I think the true reason. The drop in new coins is finally taking effect. 
@_date: 2016-10-24 09:34:27


What the... yup, I got that mixed up. I was certain of it, too! Amazing how faulty memory can be. 


Amazing. Such a shame that he's gone.

In the early days of Bitcoin, a lot of blue-sky visions were spun by eager and vocal enthusiasts, long before anyone had a clear grasp as to what *actual* problem Bitcoin was solving, and what its technical limitations were.
One very widely shared vision was that Bitcoin would compete with existing payment systems. ~~Satoshi himself wrote of this possibility in his whitepaper by discussing how Bitcoin could achieve Visa-scale~~ *[edit: my mistake, that's not actually in the whitepaper]*. And so it was taken as inevitable by many that Bitcoin would be used to cheaply process everyday transactions such as coffee. 
As the years went by, it became clear that Bitcoin couldn't achieve Visa-scale at the base layer without sacrificing decentralization. Obviously, some people vehemently disagree, which is why there's so much infighting. 
Fortunately, the Core development community understands that scaling will come through a combination of major efficiency improvements in the client software, and through the use of higher-level protocols that sacrifice a some decentralization for visa-scale transaction rates.

Bitcoin is not a product, it's a value transfer and storage mechanism for the internet. Censorship resistance is its highest priority, not satisfying market demands. It is primarily a technical challenge that requires ideological clarity to remain true to the principle of censorship resistance. 
If TCP/IP was created democratically, there would be no internet. 
@_date: 2016-07-17 06:27:20
Sorry, but with its own token, it's a competitor. Too bad! It could have used Bitcoin, and then we'd be on board.
@_date: 2016-07-19 06:58:23
Ethereum to 25% of its community: fuck you. Nice consensus.
@_date: 2016-07-19 06:56:34
The company that was created by a handful of core devs to fund their development, because companies like *Coinbase* weren't chipping in! Why the fuck would Blockstream be criticized for that?
