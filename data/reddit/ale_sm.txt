Socialism didn't fail... Basing your governments budget, currency, etc. On ONE (oil) commodity failed.

The real issue here is that it's Wells Fargo.

Why would I ever need to send that amount of money internationally? Am I importing a car or something? Or laundering money?

Never had any hidden fees either, but I did pay an overdraft fee once! ��

I never said that, but serious question how many people do, especially internationally? How many people even have that much disposable income?  
Bank to bank is understandable, but like I previously said I've never paid a fee for that and others don't either. In my personal experience banks also have international partners and/or their own presence so those fees don't happen. (Hell my credit/debit cards don't even have ATM or international fees anymore).  
Person to person would most likely carry a fee (wire transfers, international, etc), but the only example I can think of is migration or sending money to family in another country. That fee is usually the price paid for insurance on the money as well and clearing House fees to make sure the money isn't being used for laundering purposes or illegal goods. (Sanctions and other stuff.)  How many of those people have access to the block chain or places that accept it? What's the point in Bitcoin if they then need to take the extra time to go exchange it for local currency? If there are fees many people, like myself, don't care to pay the small fees anyway.
What about loans? Eventually if the block chain comes to it's full potential, how will loaning money work? What's stopping the banks from loaning money with high fees and APR to maintain profit margins in a post Fiat currency world? You'd still be legally required to pay the bank or creditor back so no escaping that part.
The block chain has built in security and a written history of transactions that can be traced (From my understanding at least), but block chain technology is being used for illegal goods like drugs (silk road anyone?) Or bypassing sanctions (looking at you Venezuela and Russia). At least for the moment until sensible regulation comes in and stops that.
In my personal experience I've had trouble convincing people to drop traditional banks with high fees, let alone throw all their money into a virtual currency that they've had no experience with.
End rant.

Uh? My bank transfers are free and have been for years.
