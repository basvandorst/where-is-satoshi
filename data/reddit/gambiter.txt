Let's take any coin that's worth less now than it has been at some point in the past, pretend you bought at the worst time in the coin's existence, and then use it as 'proof' that buying anything other than BTC is a bad idea. ��

It seems you're using the term 'wrongthink' sarcastically.
So just to be clear, you believe the school shootings are all hoaxes and people should target the students who are really 'crisis actors', correct? Because that's what you're defending.

Not to mention it has support for things like slots, where you can run multiple versions of the same software package. Not helpful on a personal machine as much, but in a live server environment when you need to do things like A/B testing, this can be helpful. 
That said, things are going the direction of VMs everywhere, so this was more of a selling point from the past. You need a very specific use case to justify it.

I see a lot of people pretending to be 'woke' and scoffing.
For what it's worth, I read this as pointing out their hypocrisy. Banks have shat on crypto for a long time, public figures claim crypto is used by criminals, etc. All the while, the legit institutions are getting insane fines for allowing the things they were projecting.

Unless I'm misunderstanding the context, it looks to me like he's just saying there isn't actually a 21 million coin limit, which is a myth I'm sure a few of us have seen parroted. He's saying since a full BTC can be divided, there is a higher limit, and it's the equiv of 1 satoshi being 1 coin, which is technically correct.
Am I missing something?

I'm not sure if you just believe all the memes or if you were too lazy to watch the presentation?
First, the monitor and stand aren't intended for consumers, and there was nothing in the presentation that implied Apple is trying to get fanboys to part with their money for it. Every bit of it was presented as a tool for professionals, including the price.
Second, there's a VESA adapter. They could have gone the route of insisting you can only use the monitor with their stand, but they didn't. If you're a company buying $5000 monitors for your employees, having the option to either buy a stand *or* an adapter is a welcome thing.
I'm not a fanboy, I'm just weirded out by the echo chamber hate that's going on. HURRRDURRTHOUSANDDOLLARSTAND!!!1! It would be like if Buffet's 'rat poison' comment was made into a meme and people started hating on Bitcoin because they couldn't be bothered to do even a basic amount of research.

It's more that it seems like you're hinging it on very specific issues that aren't really issues to most people. That's why I used the Tesla/Jeep analogy. I get that it's not exactly the same, just trying to convey my side of the argument.


I would argue that it's not the 'exact same' hardware. Apple had multi-touch and clickable trackpads before anyone else. They have the touchbar, which can be surprisingly useful. Their phones have better screens than most, better cameras than most, etc. I don't think anyone can really argue those points. Yes, at the core it's still an Intel chipset, but it's not *all* about that. So you take what is generally a unique combination of hardware and add an OS that takes advantage of it all, and you get an experience that you can't really replicate easily. That's the attraction.


You're right. I'm not trying to be dismissive, just pointing out that your points seem very slanted. I'm sure my defenses are too. I'm not even that much of a fanboy, tbh... it just seems we each draw our lines at different places, which is entirely acceptable.
Take care!
@_date: 2019-01-04 16:54:03
Ehh, maybe more accurate would be to say that I think their devices are worth 20% less than they sell them for. I'm taking the hardware, OS, ecosystem, and ease-of-use into account. I have one Macbook Pro that has lasted longer than 2 laptops, one of which was a $2400 Sager. I know it's anecdotal, but I've had nothing but success with Apple hardware... their QC seems to consistently put out stuff that lasts.
@_date: 2019-01-11 03:10:58
If you were genuine, you wouldn't make such weak trolling attempts.
@_date: 2019-01-04 16:42:48


I can understand that. Apple has always required their hardware to run their OS, and I agree that it's not cool. Once they switched to Intel, there's no reason it should be so locked down. I guess I just accept it at this point. I don't feel like it's a deal breaker, but again, subjective opinion.


So the conspiracy theorist in me wants to believe that they really are being dicks and were trying to sneak in planned obsolescence, but at the same time, their explanation about older batteries makes technical sense to me. I've never really cared a lot, because I tend to get a new phone every couple years, but if I were stuck on an iPhone 6 and saw it slowing down, it would definitely annoy me. I'm not sold on them definitely being evil about it, but I don't know that anyone on either side has enough information to say for sure.


The gauge for a good OS isn't necessarily about how much hardware it runs on. Linux will run on anything, which is awesome, yes. And as you say, you can go nuts with the kernel params and compile a custom one, but most people will never need to, and it really doesn't make a lot of difference anyway (these days). Windows will run on... PCs... but I can't install it on my router. On the OSX side, I just don't really mind... like I said, I've just accepted the situation that certain things run on certain hardware. I have also accepted that a Tesla, despite it costing waayyy more than a Jeep, will not run on trails.


Hmm, I don't get that impression from it, but again, subjective opinion. I take care of my devices... not otterbox protective, I just make sure to carry them correctly, not sit on them, etc... and I've never had an issue.


Apple releases iOS updates for [MUCH more]( than their latest phones.


If you don't like the form factor, why are you arguing then? Don't buy it. Otherwise, as I said above, I'm not convinced they are intentionally trying to hurt consumers who don't upgrade. If they were, a $60 battery replacement wouldn't return the device to full speed.
It seems like overall, you just don't like Apple. That's perfectly fine, but your comment doesn't really convince me it's a logical choice as much as a justification for your pre-existing hate. I don't really mind though... everyone is entitled to their opinion.
Have a great day!
@_date: 2019-01-04 20:12:03
Yeah, I get what you mean. I mean, at this point, they could choose to sell all of their devices at a loss for years without going into the negative. The biggest thing that annoys me is their use of tax shelters... I get it, their focus should be on profits, but not by (arguably) cheating the country.
At the same time, I think there's a case to be made for that being okay... they're making insane strides on their chip fab (the latest iPad is evidence of that), they're always working on the next iteration of their devices and UI, plus they're working on self-driving tech, etc. Who knows what they have going on, but it's certainly an interesting thought to let a ludicrously rich company spend money on R&amp;D.

Either you're being disingenuous, or you haven't seen enough of what Peterson says.
People can both give good advice *and* make pseudo-intellectual, conflicting, and intentionally provocative/misguided statements. When that happens, that person can be criticized. If you're arguing that a little good justifies everything else, then maybe you should reexamine your world view.
@_date: 2019-01-04 15:07:39
Why exactly would you choose Linux first and Windows second, when OSX is basically BSD underneath, and comes with many of the same tools you'd know from Linux? It doesn't make a lot of sense. I understand that opinions are subjective, but they should at least have some sort of logic.
I'll be the first to admit Apple charges too much for their hardware. I'd say on average, Apple charges 20% more than they should. That said, OSX is a fucking excellent OS, the Macbook Pro is superior build quality than most laptops and will both last longer *and* hold it's value longer than competitor devices. iOS is simply more polished and less vulnerable than Android. Yes, across the board you give up some customization ability, but it's obviously not a big enough deal for the vast majority of people, including developers. There's a reason you see so many Macbooks at dev conferences.
I'm not saying there's no other option. I have a dozen Linux servers, a Windows laptop, and several Apple devices, and it's a great mix. In my opinion (which, yes, is subjective), anyone who comes down on the side of 'never Apple' or 'never Windows' or whatever else, are just being closed minded, and don't know enough to understand you need different tools for different jobs.
@_date: 2019-01-11 02:30:35
So you're disingenuous then.


I have no idea who this make-believe criticizer is, but you're obviously not talking about me, so I have no idea what you're trying to get at.
[Here's something]( that explains it better than I can in a comment on Reddit. Based on your comment, I doubt you'll thoughtfully consider the points, but I'm at least posting it for others who might be interested.

He says insane things because it gets him donations. He's specifically said that in conversations before. That why he makes outlandish claims (like atheists believe in god whether they want to admit it or not). He said when he makes statements like that, he gets a backlash, and his donations go up. He's a con man, just playing a part.
@_date: 2018-12-28 02:15:44
Plenty of people through history have developed groundbreaking ideas/theories/technologies, while still having insane ideas that no one should take seriously. Peterson is obviously a smart guy, but he's also veeerrry stuck on his assumptions about many things, and likes to assault people with word salad explanations when his more crazy ideas are challenged, in the hopes that they'll give in.
The point being, you and the person you're replying to are both right, but in different ways.
@_date: 2018-12-28 02:56:06
I think the alt-right label is quite stupid indeed. I've honestly never heard anything from Peterson that indicates an alt-right leaning, unless people are simply overreacting to his views on gender. If that's the case, they are clearly wrong.
On the pseudo-intellectual side though, I think it's apt. The reason being, he uses high sounding words and speaks with confidence, but when you unpack his ideas, they are exposed as conflicting (and sometimes outright fallacious) overgeneralizations. There's just so much online from him, it's hard to even begin to unpack it all, but [here's a good video]( to start.
Ultimately, I think that's why people refer to him as pseudo-intellectual. It's a lazy label in a way, but there's almost no other way to do it. His speeches and debates are filled with some good stuff and some wacko stuff, and it's difficult to do anything other than pass him off as disingenuous.

@_date: 2013-12-10 13:46:54
It's a different way of looking at it. You're suggesting that those who mine are doing it only for profit. Essentially, you're encouraging speculation in BTC. That's fine, to an extent, but it's not for everyone, and success heavily depends on when you buy.
I bought a bitfury miner about a month ago that does 2.3 GH/s. I mined for a couple weeks, and in that time I have learned a LOT about the way Bitcoin (and alt coins) work. I have a deeper interest now, one that I wouldn't have had if I had just 'invested'. Now I'm selling the miner for more than I paid, which takes the cost of the miner totally out of the ROI equation.
So now, not only do I have extra money from the miner sale (that I can either use to buy a faster miner, or invest in more BTC), but I have a balance in my Bitcoin wallet that isn't tied to 'making a profit'... it's essentially free BTC that I can watch to see where it goes. On top of that, I have a MUCH deeper appreciation for the technology. Personally, I wish more people would take this path, because that appreciation for BTC will allow me to make much more informed decisions in the future.
@_date: 2018-12-28 04:24:20


I do think that's part of it. I mentioned in another comment that he outright said he makes more money when he makes controversial statements, so I do think he intentionally says things in the way he does.
On the other hand, and what you'll see in the video, is that he makes conflicting statements, and redefines ideas without telling his audience so, all the while using language that is (intentionally or not) convoluted. He avoids stating what he believes in *clear* terms. So essentially, two people with different views can come away from watching a Peterson debate thinking he agrees with them.


For sure. I don't think it's all about money. I think it's a bit about money (maybe 10%), a bit more about narcissism (maybe 30%), and the rest about wanting to make a cultural change.


Right on man, I definitely agree. There are things I've agreed with Peterson on. For instance, in his conversation with Sam Harris about free will, I largely agreed with Peterson rather than Harris. I thought he did a good job articulating the points, and I thought Harris seemed dogmatic. So it's not that Peterson is 100% wrong, but more that he says some truly crazy things, and it's hard to get a clear picture of where he stands on some issues. Combine that with his statements on controversy and donations, and I just get a sort of con man vibe from him.
@_date: 2013-12-10 15:32:19


You were explaining the 'mining fallacy' to ca3ru5 in the post I replied to. Maybe I misunderstood, but your tone reminded me of the recent "mine or buy" discussions, where the same points get brought up. By saying the person is better off buying than mining, you ARE encouraging speculation.
Otherwise, I agree with you. If you're in it solely to make a profit, you're certainly better off just treating BTC like the stock market. I (probably naively) hope, though, that more and more hobby miners will get involved.
