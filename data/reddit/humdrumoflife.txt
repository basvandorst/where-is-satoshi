I think the problem is that what was once a fraction of their portfolio is suddenly not so small after a while.

These things are ridiculously expensive, like 10-15%% markup in my city. Never will use an ATM, as much of a good idea it was.

Thanks for the replies. I just thought putting it on any kind of device like a phone or pc that is able to send and recieve information is going to always comprpomise security. My idea was to just buy them and keep them cold stored. But I think realistically I would like to put all my atm bitcoin into one wallet, but I don't even have an android phone or anything like that.

Newbie question alert-
Can someone tell me how ownership works.
Lets say I own 0.1 bitcoin and keep buying 0.1 until I have a full bitcoin.
I am finding it hard to conceptualise how all those fragments are now 1 bitcoin, my address will say 1 bitcoin but what links my wallet to those bitcoins transactions? I think my don't physically own the bitcoin, just that I have the necessary keys to be able to move them?
Basically when you buy crytpo, what do you own, and how does ownership work and consolidate in your wallet?
When you look at my address, how does the system know this address has x y z? is anything physically sent to that address?

Thanks for your reply. To me it just sounds like a fragmented hard drive, does this not slow down the network?

can someone tell me how you pay with bitcoins, i mean does the menu have a set bitcoin amount, or do you charge according to what bitcoin in worth at the time?
