Someone's salty.

"At least learn basic TA" in a market where that's literally useless because of how volatile it is. Right. Thanks Mr. Expert lmao.
@_date: 2018-09-05 23:47:43
Congratulations on continuously playing yourselves lmao. The progress of nearly two weeks lost in a matter of hours. Glad I pulled out a long time ago lol.
@_date: 2018-09-06 00:50:18
It's tanking even harder than it was an hour ago. LOOOOOL.
@_date: 2018-09-06 01:01:06
Yeah dude. In a wheelchair.
@_date: 2018-09-06 00:38:04
"This pull back is expected." What every naive bitcoin enthusiast says to make themselves feel better lol. It's plummeting even harder. Have fun.
@_date: 2018-06-24 19:17:10
Nope. Already sold all I had lol. I'm good. 
@_date: 2018-06-30 01:53:55
Or, y'know, unless it keeps going lower and lower...
@_date: 2018-06-24 21:15:11
No rebuttal proves my point...
@_date: 2018-06-24 18:55:53
"You come on to a reddit thread dominated by people who are well versed in the space..." stopped reading after this. How stupid are you really?
@_date: 2018-06-29 19:20:06
So, bitcoin still doesn't seem to be doing well. That must suck for all of you who are HODLing.
@_date: 2018-06-24 19:06:17
The only thing he's right about is that speculation is pointless and so is applying trends to graphs to "predict" price action.
@_date: 2018-06-24 16:26:22
This thing is dead. You're all so incredibly naive it's sad.
@_date: 2018-06-24 19:58:56
You realize nearly 75% of its value has been lost in six months, right? Your point is completely invalid lol. Take a seat.
@_date: 2018-06-24 20:12:53
When bitcoin has lost nearly 75% of its value in six months, an 8% increase, especially since there has been a negative trend for so long, means absolutely nothing. To answer your question, I'm not stupid nor am I naive. I look at things objectively and I'm realistic. Sorry that displeases you in your fantasy land. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 17:17:34
As if such a small jump actually has any significance. How stupid are you? Have you not seen how poorly bitcoin has been doing over the past month and a half?
@_date: 2018-06-24 17:04:26
It's objectively not actually dead, yes, but it's not flourishing or having any positive price action. The hype is over. This won't be going to ATH's. John McAfee is wrong.
@_date: 2018-06-30 01:26:30
Get out when it was good like I did.
@_date: 2018-06-29 18:46:05
Still an inaccurate statement lol. You don't know how well or not well-versed I am based on a handful of comments on a website that's a cesspool for stupidity. You're full of bad points...
@_date: 2018-06-24 21:28:51
You clearly didn't read my comment so I'll say it again. In \*six\* months. Bitcoin has lost. Nearly \*75&amp; Of its value.
@_date: 2018-06-24 21:44:35
That in less time it lost more...
Your point?
@_date: 2018-06-24 16:39:54
Can't remember the last time I actually called someone a loser so that's an inaccurate statement.
@_date: 2018-06-24 15:06:20
Tell me how great bitcoin is doing. Oh wait...
@_date: 2018-06-24 20:27:38
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-06-24 18:45:03
Because on my other account I was banned from this subreddit so I wanted to come back and keep shitposting.
@_date: 2018-06-29 18:08:29
You realize most of the ATH's of last year barely lasted any amount of time, right? 'Cause you DO know bitcoin was parabolic for most of the year, right? Again, your point is invalid and mine isn't lol. Thank you though. You can run along now.
@_date: 2018-06-24 16:52:14
Nope.
