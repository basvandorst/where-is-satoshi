With a state the richest people have a direct route to the top, by way of the state. 
Also apply that to the state system.
It all depends on the situation. Much better than an inefficient clunky slow judicial system rather than a streamlined efficient judicial system. I choose the private one :) One that in fact cares for my well being rather than I have to stand for the Judge when he walks in, I'm the customer.

The point is that fact that you have to sell away your soverignty and descion making power that you yourself innately have to a politician, and therefore that politician can enforce his arbitrary will on you, and of course without consent.

Ah I see. Sure you can, if the market wants it, it gets it. This is an incentive to provide just crimial punishment or rehabilitation. Whatever the market wants. If there's a need theres an incentive to make a profit.

You want to f poor people, wow.
Well I mean you support their exhortation so I get that. 
No you cannot murder just because the police stop getting their monopoly doesn't mean mass murder by rich people lol. That's what a state does, exhorts and steals from the poor. 
There's a market for every one of your concerns, which means every company will do anything to stay favorable in the eyes of customers. You want a fair trial right most customers do, defense companies agree to contracts liket this to keep favor with their customers.

When something isn't provided by a monopoly, the quality only goes up. An enforced judge by the state? Judges can be private and a lot better at that.

While I don't know what he said, I recommend Anarcho-capitalism.

A judge which is enforced by the state, oh ok I see, therefore, impossible to have a private market judge, there's no differnce except extreme accountablity

I know right I hate democracy
@_date: 2015-03-01 14:36:40
Yeah, democracy's a scam.

First of all, there are private courts nowadays, and what you're proposing do NOT happen.
For example the AAA hears over 2 million cases each year, and hundreds of thousands of cases are heard every year by other agencies and individuals. There's a market for fair just trials, no matter what.
Also things like the NPB.
