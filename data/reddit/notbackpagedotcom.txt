Can people purchase bitcoin or litecoin via coinkite?  That's the driving reason Paxful and others are getting the press with backpage.
Now that the learning curve has been scaled by a large number of their customers, wallets only services aren't such a large leap.  However, the issue for most people that don't mine is converting fiat to btc easily and being able to use those coins to purchase goods and services.

Thanks for this.

Isn't this the kind of crap Bitcoin is supposed to free us from?
Use celery.com, their markup is much cheaper.  It takes a few extra days but at least they won't discriminate.

I'm not in NY but I want to help.  How can I be of assistance?

Look at this discrimination!
These fuckers are doing the exact same thing that Bitcoin is supposed to be free of.  Why is no one upset about this?
This is discrimination.  There are NO financial regulations against using YOUR money on backapge.com.  This is pure bullshit.

I'm going to keep posting links here as I'm told that backapge customers are being told to look to r/bitcoin for info on how to buy &amp; use bitcoin.
If anyone else knows of others, please post themn.  I want to help this company fight against fascists like seriff dart.  He's drunk on power and believes he can reduce "human trafficking" across the globe.
How about you take care of the gun violence in Chicago.  Wait a tick, nope they probably wouldn't vote for you so you could care less if they died.

You sir are a fine gentleman to help them!  Can you share any info on how you did it?  I'd love to help out as many as I can too.

Then what should people do when they want to purchase BTC?  Isn't coin cafe a place to do that?  I realize that you can trasnfer to your own wallet after purchase but I think this discrimination is the kind of thing that BTC is supposed free us from.

What 2 consenting adults do behind closed doors is their own business.  They have always worked with law enforcement to bring those that harm and abuse the helpless be brought and tried in court.

I bet you were rejected by one of those "whores".  You gonna cry?  Get some respect for yourself and move out of your moms basement.
@_date: 2015-07-17 20:08:44
Let me know if I can be of assistance with that.

It's not really Visa cutting them off per se.  They have to work with a bank that is the middle man to Visa and MC.  Visa tells that bank to stop processing payments from this customer of theirs.  If they don't comply, they will lose their ability to process Visa and MC for all of their customers.
This is basically like black listing a person with the casino community.  Once you're there, no one wants your patronage.  You can see they are refusing to close and refusing to modify their site for some misguided, misinformed sense of "justice" that a 2 bit sheriff who hasn't worked with his local law enforcement agencies in over 2 years is trying to use to get himself re-elected.  This isn't the first time Backpage has had to deal with this shit.  It won't be the last.  They will continue to fight.  That's why I want to support them any way I can.

Damn reddit won't let me post this link as a new topic.

Can you recommend anyone else that is as helpful as Paxful that Backpage could also reference?  I think they are looking for means to integrate paxful and other similar service providers are payment options on their payment page.  I'd be grateful for any suggestions and can pass them along to the proper people.
The primary thing is that their customers are intelligent people even if they aren't computer savvy.  One you explain it to them, they will take it and run.
