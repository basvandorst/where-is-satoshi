True, but they have to have sellers to buy from right? If those private sellers could get more on the exchanges than from the large buyers they would so this argument doesn't stand up. Arbitrage opportunities do show up, but they appear in both directions. 
This is related to the fallacious saying that, "there are more sellers than buyers." There can't be more sellers than buyers. One of each per transaction. There may be more people that want to sell at a certain price than want to buy, but that is constantly changing as the price changes and a person that prefers to sell at $400 might turn into a buyer at $399.

Loans are a representation of time preference of money. Some want money more now and will pay a premium (interest). This won't go away with a Bitcoin world. 
Interest rates would be a function of appreciated value and default risk, same as its supposed to be now. But in the dollar loan market there is an implicit protection of default by the Fed so the risk is not properly understood. Interest rates will probably be offset by new types of digital collateral. As for a number prediction, higher than today.

Transactions are included in the valid block. Transactions not confirmed are recycled into the new block process. Adding transactions after a block is confirmed is not possible. 
What transactions to include is totally up to the node. The problem arises that hashing transactions takes time, hence the incentive or fee to include them in the valid block. It's a balancing game between should I take the time to hash the transactions or not. 
There is room however, (I think) to hash the transactions and block separately. This would be accomplished by a multi-node operation, where one node hashes the incoming  transactions and another finds the block solution. At say 8 minutes the transaction node transmits it to the block node (saving it time).

There are two forces at play in adoption of bitcoin. One for merchants and one for consumers. Merchants can be sold by stating the obvious benefits over CCs, etc.
Consumers will be sold, not by merchant adoption or the easily stated benefits, but by price appreciation, or fiat currency issues (bail-ins and printing), because 99% will see the barriers to entry as not worth it until then. They will buy bitcoin, not to use it, but to save it, so they should properly be call investors.
When the market cap gets into the 100s of billions or so, merchants will compete more to get their hands on savers' bitcoin and offer great deals to separate people from their bitcoin. Offers they can't refuse, so to speak.

Dare I say, you are naive? Gold (and silver) were currency before they banned it. As govs around the world oppose new things, those new things expand. The US dollar has been immune to this for so long, people have forgotten. But it's changing.
If bitcoin acceptance and usage were made illegal, they'd be unconstitutional and face challenges. This process would take years (see Obamacare). By that time it will be too late. 
Your views are based on the miniscule adoption of today. However, there is a tipping point that we are approaching. As adoption nears only a few percentage points, massive adoption takes place. There is nothing to enforce the laws once the gov can't pay it's employees.

All your examples were voluntary exchanges. There is no voluntary exchange with the government. Would anyone care what the gov said if they didn't have guns, prisons, and courts? They rule by threat of force not peaceful competition. By contacting them, you are validating their rules and punishments, whether you ultimately think they are right or not, and doing a deal with the devil. Vote? So you can choose between the gov approved choices? 
The best thing for Bitcoin is just to ignore them and go about offering value to your customers, and let them self destruct under their own weight of debt and regulation.

Great letter. I'd add that a miner might have operating expenses that exceed the reward. Yet the reward is counted as income. A miner, like any business should be able to deduct expenses right? This could be huge as a loss leader for  miners and add another incentive to add your power to secure the network, so you can deduct your cost. 
A new twist that has also come to my mind recently is the ability to apply 1031 to BTC to metacoin asset exchange. The assets are digital tokens of value and live right next to Bitcoin on the blockchain. Again, this could be huge because investors could have very low friction within the BTC ecosystem. 
I like the idea of applying the rules in best faith toward the optimistic interpretation, or version, in the future. Pessimism will be self-fulfilling.

It is hard to say, of course, in dollar terms. The dollar is bound to devalue greatly in the next two years, and as big money moves out of negative real return USTs and into hard assets, bitcoin should ride that wave. 
Gold us the better measure here. Currently btc in gold oz terms is 0.5 (btc/gold). I expect this pair to be of extreme interest starting by the end of this year. A value passing 1 by early 2015 and approaching a solid 3 (or 4) by July 2017. As the value of the dollar declines that could equal a 5-10k dollar price. 
This market cap of btc will have to grow in definition by that time though. With all the user defined assets bound to appear in the next 12 months. I could see a market cap for the blockchain in general being half a trillion or more (about 1/10 the gold market total).

The only risk in dollars is how fast will it inflate? Everyone knows dollars will move in only one direction in the future, down in value. 
Holding $1000 cash over five years, we all know the outcome, &lt;$1000 purchasing power (maybe even down to $5 purchasing power or so). Cash, held in dollars, will be the worst place for money over the next 5 years. The value of Bitcoin COULD go up 100x or more in that time. It's a risk, but the dollar will definitely lose value.

The fact is that most people miss crashes (even experts in any camp). If most people think that there is no risk, there mostly likely is.  There are plenty of charts out there that show, as optimism is at relative highs for stocks, stocks slide down. If you buy the "most shorted" stocks (especially in 2013-14), you would come out ahead. It is something you have to discover on your own. You would just contradict everything I said if I linked things, or tried to show you. If one was curious and competent they'd research these ideas on their own. We only have history and logic to learn from. If history proves a logic (like the Austrian call of communism) then it will prove itself to unbiased thinkers. 
History tells us monetary orders only last for an average of of a few decades. When you look at the last 110 yrs, we had a gold standard (corrupted and killed), a dislocated gold standard with pegs (corrupted and killed), and a fiat standard (corrupted and dying). The doomsdayers you site, are historians. 
How do you measure inflation? The price of gas? The price of a 55" TV?  The prices of individual goods will differ. Even in hyperinflation the price of goods differ in the intensity of increase. If you look at the price of chicken breast, it's gone up an average of 50% the last 4 years (for me at least). The CPI has changed its metrics many times, even in the last 20 years. 
You probably aren't still reading this, but the austrian/conspiracy people have been proven right time and again in the last few years. (LIBOR manipulation, gold manipulation), don't think that the sovereigns aren't watching, too. (China / Russia gas deal, US out maneuvered in Syria and Ukraine, the impending crisis in the south China Sea). Governments ruin everything due to the mal-inventives of power. Gold was the first decentralized monetary weapon which has now been mostly centralized (and manipulated). Bitcoin fills that role post Internet, it actually is the unseen hand behind the invention of Bitcoin itself. There must be some questioning of authority in you to be a proponent of crypto.

OK, the merkle root is a static size, but that doesn't say anything about the work involved or the contents. The work comes from the block solution, not the transactions hashing. It takes a fraction of a second to hash transactions into a merkle root right? Transactions and solution are separate, in other words there can be a zero transaction block. 
My add on point was that a single node could save that time by outsourcing the transaction listening and hashing, which is included in the valid block.

Now that the Japan Central Bank has pulled out all stops and is buying over 70% of the country's debt issuance in a desperate attempt to increase liquidity (read inflating the hell out of the yen), spending in Japan is at a 32 year low. 
I recommend not believing in the deflation boogeyman. Inflation leads to mal-investment. People cannot calculate economic factors accurately during inflation, because inflation is not consistent throughout the economy (heard of bubbles?). How is a fat cat supposed to know where to invest their money, unless they have connections in the very government that is pumping the money in? How is the average Joe supposed to know what rent is fair, or if that 100th toy for his kid is worth it to the balance sheet? They can't, because inflation makes economic calculation impossible. 
Paraphrasing one person in this thread who wrote, 'Modern economics is based on measurement and science, not thought experiments.' Whatever! Measurement is not possible during inflation. Human activity and value judgements are way to complex and ever-changing for a formula. Ever heard of logic? That's where things have to make sense in a thought experiment. I do agree that modern economics and logic don't work together.
Decreasing prices (as opposed to deflation, which is the shrinking of the supply of money) makes people more conscious of the decisions they make economically. It makes the labor they put in today worth more than waiting until tomorrow. It rewards handwork and thrift, not laziness and excess. If absent government inflation, prices would tend downward due to increases in technology. Bitcoin is a great example. 
Bottom line, the grand inflationary experiment will fail due the very things that touted as strengths, namely increasing liquidity and stimulating debt while inflating that debts burden. Stable money supply (which leads to a decrease in prices) is the only way to have accurate economic decisions.

The state sure has done a great job in enforcing drug laws. They can't do much if we choose to resist. Bitcoin has a moral high ground that is not assailable if we don't give in. There is little they can say against it, other than 'it's not under our control so you can't do it.' That is super weak and won't stand in the world of public opinion.

What people like Rand don't get yet is that the government is stopping people from issuing stocks on the Bitcoin network by way of counterparty etc, because they regulate stock offerings. Those companies existing on the network would "back" the network. The catch 22 is that we must disobey the current laws to get support from politicians (maybe) to change the laws, and maybe get prosecuted in the mean time.

Those aren't real returns I take it. Minus inflation? It's funny how when we compare dollar values we use a base year, ie 1998 dollars, but when we calculate inflation we don't, ie 1998 inflation metrics. Those metrics change almost every year, and would be well over 5% today. 
Only 5% of mutual funds out performed the S&amp;P in 2013. And they averaged 6% return, not real return. 
Also, if the Fed didn't distribute free money to the TBTF the crashes would be much worse. The whole thing is a bubble ready to pop, waiting for Saudi to shift oil pricing out of the dollar, or foreign investors to lose confidence.

A bitcoin rise won't happen in a vacuum. Most likely it will coincided with a huge devaluation of the dollar itself. Those ATM operators won't want to trade for dollars at that point.

This is called marginal cost in economics. I think difficulty leveling off or decreasing is what will signal a price turn around. This happens in precious metals all the time too.

Yep. It goes in cycles. However, I think each cycle represents a phase of growth. The next leg is institutional investors getting in, which I think will happen by the end of the year. 
Money velocity theory is also applicable here. As money moves faster between hands, like a hot potato, prices tend downward all else equal. As new people come into the market, like investors, velocity will slow, which tends to move prices upward.
The BTC dollar price is also affected by dollar movements. Which has been strong the last 6 months. I also watch the btc/Gold ratio which one would expect to move in a similar way.

History is replete with examples of failed currencies of over confident powers. No other evidence is needed. The only question is timing. The longer we go without a "collapse" the more likely it is to occur sooner. It is the height of hubirous to think the laws of economics that have caused others to collapse don't apply to the dollar. That is why I say, your position is the one without standing. Until you offer evidence to show that what happens 100% of the time, won't happen to the dollar, the burden of proving a position is with you. 
Never said the US is not about to fall apart. The dollar is, and is going to continue to devalue, just as it has the last 100, only at a slightly increased rate. Good luck with your long USG debt strategy, I hope you are right.

All of what you say is based on today's definitions of those things. For example, if bitcoin succeeds the IRS will cease to exist.

Even citizenship will be more gray.

You are right. But what percentage of people pay all their taxes under the dollar? I mean a large portion of the federal budget is spent just enforcing taxes. That must mean that a lot of people out there try to avoid them. Bitcoin just makes it 100x easier to do. How many people claim all their tips? Small businesses give discounts for using cash many times, why? 
It will happen in steps. First 5% of taxes are lost, then 20%, etc. And it will be financially restrictive to go after tax avoiders, because they can't confiscate the money after arrest like with dollars. Step by step, the gov will lose each round, until they shrink to a impotent size. Walmart and alike will pay all their taxes, yes. Which actually will put them at a huge disadvantage to the small mom and pop businesses who are more nimble and stealthy.

Metacoins (or project tokens) are not it's own currency, at least how I understand them. They allow a project (company) to use an internal decentralized economy unto itself, a micro-economy if you will, while harnessing all the benefits of the Bitcoin network. They can connect with, and offer value to that micro economy. It adds ties between participants like real social interactions. Metacoins really add a socio-economic layer to Bitcoin and allow for a decentralized yet social experience.

The marginal cost should provide a pretty hard floor on the price. That's the cost to mine the next block divided by the reward. This often marks the floor in the precious metal corrections and have been understood for many decades. If prices go down its harder to mine profitably making some people stop mining or not upgrade equipment. The increase in the difficulty is the canary here.
If we have a slowing of the growth rate in difficulty, that should signal the turn around in price.

Multi-layered, time sensitive question.
Governments will fight for fiat, outlawing/confiscating gold/silver/bitcoin, shortly leading to hyperinflation.
Next they'll want a gold standard, because many governments hold a large amount of gold as reserves. With those reserves they still have some control. (I think that the tide could stop there for several years)
Next, gold and silver will lead to a more accurate measurement of the economy. Bubbles will be exposed along with stupid tech advances. Bitcoin and blockchain tech will emerge as successes in a fabulous fashion.
Strategy: hold physical gold and silver in large percentages of your savings. And diversify into bitcoin smartly and over time.

Bitcoin will collapse in value with a huge deflationary shock, like gold in 2009. So cash is king in the short term. But as fiat continues down gold and bitcoin will bounce WAY up.

@_date: 2014-07-02 00:53:50
Merchant adoption will not drive consumer adoption. The consumer is king, and Bitcoin does not live in a bubble. Outside forces like dollar inflation, etc mean a lot. 
Absent a dollar collapse, I think assets from counterparty and mastercoin could be the catalyst for massive adoption. We need more clients to support support these assets and Vennd to be integrated. Consumer adoption is 12 months away because of the time it will take to make the network "multi-app" (as opposed to single app, bitcoin only).
I expect the price to increase 100s of % per year (not 1000s) with periods of pull back and consolidation. This process will happen for the next 3 years or so. 
Just my two bits.

All those protections come at a price. It's not free to insure your funds or replace them if stolen or lost. That price is paid implicitly by every holder of dollars. 
With bitcoin those costs are explicit (but new open source software is coming out all the time to solve these issues). When people lose bitcoin it actually helps all other holders of bitcoin because the supply is reduced. 
Plus doesn't all the hand holding offend you as a grown adult? It's like they tell you are so stupid that you can't protect your own funds, and then of course people become dependent on the hand holding.

You are correct that the fees for consumers are slightly higher using btc, especially if you include some of the reward programs with CCs.
HOWEVER, as more merchants accept bitcoin and have to compete on price, they will lower prices to attract customers. Then consumers will have a direct benefit. We already see this now with some big discounts from merchants. 
Eventually, merchants and consumers will equally split the benefit of lower fees, and legacy payment systems will disappear.
