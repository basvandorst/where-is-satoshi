Can anyone confirm this? If I use btc to buy a car and then sell the car for $ - would I have to pay capital gains tax?

I don't follow the logic here. The reason that the price of prohibited drugs increases is because they become more scarce as the cost to make, transport and distribute them increases. Those same factors not exist with BitCoin

    I’m your facebook friend,
    I'm not your only friend
    but I’m a really trolling friend
    But really I’m not actually your friend
    But I am

    Make a little trollhouse in your soul
    Not to put too fine a point on it
    Hey I’ll deride if I aint in on it
    Make a little trollhouse in your soul
    I have a secret to tell
    from social media hell
    If you bought some bitcoins you're a dunce - it's time to shut up and sell
    Though I sure don't comprehend the
    value of cryp-to-cur-ren-cy
    That won't stop commentary
    From the band T-M-B-G
    My ego’s infinite!
    Like Max Keiser’s pompous wit
    It doesn’t end

    Of my primitive ancestry
    Ignorant luddites who
    would spurn any new tech-no-logy
    Though I respect that you see
    I am an artist - not a genie
    All I know is pundits say that I should from the BTC flee
    Who cares - I’m ignorant
    with a default fiat bent, always fear..

Here is a brainwallet secure strategy:
1. use what ever pass phrase you want.
2. SHA 256 to generate private/public keypair
3. concatenate the resulting private and public key with some other passphrase inbetween (or some some other obfuscating method)
4. SHA 256 that string to generate a new private/public keypair
5. repeat this or some variation thereof an arbitrary number of times. 
Now you have to remember the passphrase as well as whatever unique algorithm you made up to generate the final key pair - but there is no brute force language based attack that your pair is susceptible to.

this sounds like a plausible solution - so long as that service finds a way to obfuscate their process from even themselves.

How will mining profits be reduced? 25 for a mined block today is valued higher than 50 bit coins were for a block mined a year ago. Also, once coins run out, transaction fees will provide mining incentive.

Is there a way to have the iPhone play mp3's over Bluetooth? I have wanted to do this for years but have never seen a solution...

Funny - demand doesn't change the rate of coin production. Neither does number of miners given auto adjusting difficulty.

I just want a widget with the price as well as a simple graph.

If this is true, then they are priced way too low and the company selling them has not done a proper opportunity cost analysis.

i didn't mean it was literally funny. I just mean that encouraging more miners does nothing but reduce the amount that each miner stand to earn. It is funny (as in odd) that he would choose mining to be the thing that he encourages. 
What would really help bitcoin is to encourage more buy in and more exchange and more merchant support.

Dont do it - if it crashes or fails they will blame you. You can educate them as much as possible - but you want the decision to be their own so that if there is a loss they can only blame themselves.
 Just work hard and take your own earnings and if you believe it is a good risk - then risk your own wealth on it.

If I sell you product A and give you a public-key as part of that transaction you can then look at the block chain and see where that transaction is and Then follow the money to any subsequent address that it is sent to. It's mostly anonymous but not completely so.
 If the entry that is placed in the ledger is encrypted then even though you make the payment to an address that you know you will not be able to identify which entry in the ledger corresponds to that particular payment because the hash is not predictable from the address.
It may be that a third party service could devise a way to fulfill this function.
