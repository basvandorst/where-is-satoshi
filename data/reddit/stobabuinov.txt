Cops search a man's apartment and find a moonshine distilling apparatus.
"Nice", says the cop, "You're going to jail for illegal alcohol distillation."
"I'm innocent!"
"But you've got the apparatus!"
"Then charge me with rape."
"Did you rape someone?"
"No, but I've got the apparatus."
(Russian folklore)

(Another, pithy one)
A policeman spotted a criminal... but he was outranked.

I'm surprised that's a question and even more surprised at the lack of a good answer.
Spending bitcoin is the best thing you as an individual can do for Bitcoin. If it's not used for business transactions, it's not much of a currency, really. By spending/earning in bitcoin, you are reaffirming it as such and increasing its acceptance and value.
Vote with your money. Vote with your choice of currency. Reward those who accept Bitcoin.

BTW, I'm in the same boat. Just got into it last week with a small amount and fully share your excitement. This stuff is the future. I shouldn't have been dismissing it out of intellectual laziness for so long.

The crowd suddenly pulled back, he was left alone for a few seconds. Happened a couple of days ago in Moscow.

Judging by your comment history, you seem to be a sensible person. I have no idea how you got this one so wrong. All of the Kirovles court documents are [online]( I suggest you read them.

Don't praise it either.

Do not underestimate Georgia. It is small and poor, but it has a lot of substance as a nation. Not counting the Baltic republics (they were different to begin with), Georgia so far is the only success story in ex-USSR.

Install the wallet software from [electrum.org]( Run it, carefully do what it tells you to do (create a mnemonic phrase so that you can restore the wallet if something bad happens, write it down, store securely). Once set up, go to the "Receive" tab - there you will find the address to send to from Coinbase. Send the money and wait anxiously for 10-100 minutes to see the transaction go through.
Edit: Perhaps the most important thing to understand is the only asset here is the **private keys**. Your bitcoin balance is recorded on the blockchain and does not exist outside of it. A wallet does not store bitcoin, it stores the keys. The keys allow you to sign transactions, i.e., to change your balance on the blockchain. Right now, Coinbase has the keys to your money.

Boils down to: should you entrust your valuables to a third party? Right now, your money is not in your wallet - it is in Coinbase's wallet which Coinbase says is yours. Legal ownership is not the same as physical control. If Coinbase fucks up in some way (gets hacked or suffers a techical issue), you may never get your money back. A personal wallet is insurance from that, but now the responsibility not to fuck up is on you. As Andreas recently stated, the best way to store Bitcoin is probably hardware wallets because you can have full control while eliminating most security risks, and you don't need to be a security expert for that.

In principle, yes. It is just less secure* and thus not a wise choice for long-term storage, especially for large amounts. For now, you will probably be fine, but you should at least learn how to store your money in your own pocket and not somebody else's.
*Why less secure? Basic economics of theft. A centralized exchange is a lucrative target for hackers - little risk, high rewards. If someone finds a vulnerability in Coinbase security (which surely exist, as they do in any complex system), they will sweep all the accounts they can. On the other hand, if you have a personal wallet, the potential gains are tiny in comparison, and the costs are large: the attack would need to be targeted, they would need to access to your specific machine, and in the case of hardware wallets, they would need physical access. Not really worth it in most cases, and outright impossible if nobody knows you have bitcoin.
But Coinbase is probably better than a software wallet on a malware-ridden personal machine.

This man reminds me of that seagull from Little Mermaid who was held by Ariel to be an expert on man-made artifacts but was making stuff up on the spot. 
[Scuttle]( I haven't seen this in years, this is wonderful!
