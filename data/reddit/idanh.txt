Patent trolls will hunt you down, it's never about winning in court (altho if needed they will take you there) but more like drowning you with legal fees until the choice of paying them seems attractive enough.

I have a suggestions for this sub, maybe cut down posts like that which only have the world "bitcoin" in them, that in my opinion, does not contribute anything to the community expect some laughter (which can be obtained from and also cut down posts of this kind "I suggested bitcoin to my ice-cream seller and he said he will maybe think about it!!". 
I know what upvotes and downvotes are, and I believe that there are many people here in this sub, that are excited about seeing the word bitcoin or talking about bitcoin or sharing pictures of bitcoin machines spotted near a lake, which makes this sub a little (no offense) like r/aww for bitcoin...
I don't want to start a fight that's why I'm choosing my words, and only trying to get the point across. is maybe a good example of a well-known large subreddit with mostly great, informative submissions..

Dude some common sense please. You made a wrong statement, and after others trying to educate you, you retreat to say it's phrasing.
It's not and you don't have to admit it, just stop replying with false information.. also common sense here would dictate that you can at least Google what others are telling you.

If it's not tracked you cannot insure it. Maybe for you with a wallet of $10,000 is neglegeble. Maybe you aren't afraid that someone, digitally or physically steal your money (many ways to do so), but with enough money I bet you wouldn't store it all in an uninsured wallet. Same reason you pay for home insurance. Bitcoin is cool, no doubt. And buissness all around the world need to use it. An ecosystem should evolve around it. Did you know that actual bills are begin transfered all around the world all the time? Millions of dollars. Think about it, why not just use a database and print/shred money?

Sure. But the forms you're going to fill are longer, don't you agree? You need to identify the receiver, the sender, insure both sides, make sure the transaction is not fraudulent, and million other things. 
Doing bank to bank transfers is mostly "fill name and account

You've just compared sending cash money internationally and sending visual currency. If I'm sending money from bank-to-bank, without withdrawing it, depending on the bank it can take from 1h to 3 days.
Withdrawing bitcoins to cash may take the same amount of time.
It's also very simple to transfer from bank-to-bank, while transferring bills and insuring them may costs a bit more and is more complex.

Just... Ok. So when you do a transaction on any platform, it's independent from the way that platform makes new money. You realize that mining is a way to make new money yes? Maybe you mean validations. If so, you are still only partly correct. Transferring money from your US bank to a bank in Cuba, could potentially take days.

You just throw around fancy words like mining and hoped they'll work together, didn't you?
