Very good. I'm very much interested in this, although the rates for paypal are really steep, but I get that.

did a restore on my phone and google authenticator does not save through a restore and I lost my token. had to contact support but they helped me out.

what do you do to handle risk for paypal/credit card chargebacks?

Hrm.. yes that's true. I didn't give much thought to it. With the current spartans, could you dedicate several different parts to performing a hash each cycle and have a part to delegate the work to the those and handle communications to the outside?

I don't know a great deal about FPGAs or this protocol but it's my understanding that the reason GPUs and FPGAs are ideal over CPUs to begin with is because they can do embarrassingly parallel computation which means exactly that -- do several pieces of work and get back to me  when any one finishes so I think this may already be done. Also I believe that with FPGAs, you can set it up so that a single instruction exists for performing a hash, so each hash uses a cycle. Thus if you have an 800mhz FPGA core, the max processing you can get out of it is 800 mhash/s (and I know butterfly labs advertises that figure too) if they are using one instruction for a hash. This also means the chip is not idling with that rate so it's at full efficiency. Does that sound right?

actually, having a gpu setup and paying for electricity, it pays for me. not a lot, mind you.

excellent use of space too! everything's tightly packed and well organized. looks like everything is assembled on it too, just missing the precious.
