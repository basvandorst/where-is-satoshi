Yes, here is a very good explanation of this idea:

Most of the Bitcoin users never sync the full blockchain and they never will. Most users use lightwallets. That is perfectly fine. Only a small percentage of the users sync the full blockchain. But again, hundreds of millions of users could sync 20Mb blocks every 10 minutes if they wanted without problems, but we must believe that 20Mb blocks is what causes centralization of Bitcoin when we already see right now with 1MB blocks that more than 51% of the hash rate is in control of a few companies in China.

The line between 0 and infinity is the highest number you can think of.
The idea that we cannot have 20 MB blocks because mining would be centralized is ridiculous. Hundreds of millions of homes around the world can cope with 20 MB every 10 minutes. With 1MB blocks right now, mining is controled by a few people (a few miners in China have more than 51% hash rate). Because the barrier to entry in mining is already huge. Long are gone the days where normal users could mine in their homes. But somehow, I should believe that the problem of centralization is Internet speed that even normal users can have in their homes.
The more transactions the Bitcoin network can process, the more useful the Bitcoin network, the more total fees will be collected and therefore the more secure the Bitcoin network.

Gold has a cost too. Storing gold cost millions every year. Millions have to be spent to extract gold from earth and then millions have to be spent to bury gold in heavy armored and protected facilities.
"Gold just sitting there" has a cost too.

Mycelium is awesome. Electrum is awesome too.
You cannot use mycelium seed in electrum because electrum does not comply with BIP39 standard. I hope electrum in the future will implement BIP39.

I agree with the idea that free supply and free demand and free market should determine the size of the blocks and the size of the fees. No need for central planning from a few people to decide arbitrary limits to the supply of blocks. Developers should try to remove as many barriers as technically possible, push the limits as much as possible, not impose limits.

Thank you for fully supporting [BIP39]( 
Your implementation is a pleasure to use. Mycelium helps autocompleting the words and the fact that you support restoring mnemonics up to 24 words plus a password is remarkable. It is really top notch.
Your implementation of the BIP 39 standard is one of the reasons I prefer Mycelium over non standard mnemonics like electrum's own approach.
Thank you very much.

Coinkite, greenbits and hive use BIP39 too. Schildbach's Bitcoin wallet is going to support BIP39 too (maybe already supports it).

You are right. You could even have a script that automatically push this button for you every month.

Edit: On top of that, people are paying using paypal which allows chargebacks and that's why almost nobody sells bitcoins for paypal. I am the one that could be scammed if users reverted their payments.

First of all, What about sideways?
Senconf of all, I don't know if it is going up or not. Therefore I cannot say that it's going down.
Do you know if it is going to go up or not? Can you see the future? I think you can only see the past. Do you think that because price stopped rising before $300 that means in the future will never pass $300?
I don't follow your logic.

"One person in a million" means that if there are 7 billion people total, then there are 7000 like you.
"One person **of** a million" means that there are 1 million people like you.
According to ([his comment here]( you are not "one in a million", but "one **of** a million".
Edit: Terminology is important when I am not sure what you mean. However, in this coversation, terminology is not important because I understarnd what you mean.

I am not sure I understand.
You said: "You need 21 btc to be one in a million"
Therefore, If I have 0.021 BTC, am I one in a billion?
What is better, to be one in a million or to be one in a billion?
This problem has already been pointed out. This is what other users thought:

BIP39 is pretty good... Nothing is perfect, but I see Mycelium implementation and it's really a pleasure.


Not true. Future versions can have a version number. If you see a seed without version number, you know it is this first version.


Any seed is valid. There are no wrong seeds because the seed has no checksum. Nobody is going to type a seed (128-256 bits) manually. However, people are going to type mnemonics, that's why the checksum is encoded in the mnemonic seed phrase. To validate the mnemonic and to help the user with type prediction (exactly what mycelium does) you need the list of words anyway.
In any case, nothing is perfect, but I think it is better to try to improve a bitcoin standard joining forces than to impede the interoperability of wallets dividing forces. As much as I love electrum, if I make an electrum wallet, I know for sure I will be stuck in electrum **forever**. However, if I make a mycelium wallet I know I can switch to any other software that supports BIP39 standard. That's the reason standards are created, so you don't get **stuck with one piece of software forever**.

You should say that clearly on your website. Just saying "My Wallet List" did not make it clear, at least to me. From your website It looks like the best Bitcoin wallet is coinkite. You should explain that electrum or mycelium maybe are good too, but you did not try them (for some reason).
