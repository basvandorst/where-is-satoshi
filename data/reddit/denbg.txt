You need to double your bonus and get $100. After doing so you could pick any gift card on that sum. We'll have gift cards starting from $100 up to $2000. Thanks for your interest!

Because sign up is easiest and fastest way to show the interest. Not all people have time or like posting comments on the product, but if they're giving email it's clear and understandable proof of interest, and we'll love to reward this kind of people after our launch.

I understand your point, but we just want to see if this kind of service is interesting to someone, to get the feedback. It's well known and good practice to check the idea of the product on real users, show them what we are developing and get some reaction. What's the point of trying to scam someone like this, especially now, when anybody could download hundreds of thousands of leaked emails from popular bitcoin services for free?

Right after the launch we'll have blackjack, and some time later we will add more games like poker etc.

This link is just pre-launch page of our service, so don't expect to be redirected to your profile or something like that. When you enter your email you get notification below it if sign up was successfull.

Thanks for your comment! For now this is just a page for getting some feedback from interested users, not an actual functional platform. To get a gift card from this bonus you'll need to play some games and double it, because our gift cards are started from $100.

We want our platform to be really fun, interesting and easy to use. That's why, unlike other bitcoin gaming services, we'll focus on social interactions, gamification elements like leaderboards, achievements and badges. Also we'd like it to be really competitive, so there'll be such things as tournaments with cool prizes, progressive jackpots and much more in the future :)

At first there'll be Blackjack, and after some time we'll add poker and other games.
@_date: 2015-04-08 19:12:56
For now it's $100
@_date: 2015-04-08 20:21:18
5 chips to try the game
@_date: 2015-04-08 19:24:20
For now we have only poker available. But soon we'll add BlackJack and other games, as well as new badges and cool rewards :)
