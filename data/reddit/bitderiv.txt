Lol, so you admit you're talking without knowing anything about what's going on.
Regardless, to other bitcoin addresses, for a tx fee.

Only if it's actually funny.

Damn, it must take a lot of courage to be this stupid in public. I mean, wow you're literally an idiot and don't care. 
@_date: 2018-09-15 16:30:50
The data clearly shows you have no idea what you're talking about. But by all means, continue to embarrass yourself!

For sure, I'm planning on releasing a series of graphs around this over the next couple weeks. 
Be on the lookout!

And you guys really don't realize why everyone in the Capital Markets thinks of bitcoiners as annoying...
You can't act like 10,000 BTC/day in volume is even remotely significant either. Daily notational traded for a single major fund is well in the $bn, bitcoin is not even close to a drop in the bucket at this point. 
Get off your high horse there buddy, you're just as low down on the totem pole as the rest of us.

Lol, yet you haven't rebutted a single point of mine. It's ok, I'm optimistic maybe one day you'll actually add value to the discussion!

That's not how any of this works. Trading volume is considered what's called "off-chain" as it occurs on bitcoin exchanges and not on the blockchain. As long as fees are paid, it's generally not considered wash trading. Wash trading also has nothing to do with arbitrage.
The volumes provided in the chart are for "on-chain" transactions sent directly between bitcoin addresses.

Data from the IMF, bitstamp, bitcoincharts, and BC.I.

A hedge fund manager who allowed one of their traders to place capital into a foreign domiciled entity, without a prime (broker) even in place would have his entire AUM pulled out from underneath him overnight if a single investor found out.
The best western traders that any Chinese exchange is seeing is most likely some sophisticated retail arbitrage traders moving small amounts of capital in and out quickly (via BTC). Nothing personal there man, just being a bit realistic.
&amp; I've met most of the team at Coinsetter. They actually remind me a lot of the guys over at IEX Group, similar mentality and insight on market structure. Guys are no joke.

For sure, although technically similar in terms of states within the USA.

UTXOs are the primary product of the bitcoin economy. Value of UTXOs is effectively what's represented here.

He clearly says public blockchains shouldn't be used outside of niche use cases. 
And idk if you've been around many finance people, but they're not exactly known for being overly well mannered. While their insults tend to be less focused on physical appearance and more on intelligence and significance, they still spew them left &amp; right.

"Yet if researchers empirically observe that the failure risks associated with various public blockchains is within an accepted risk profile – in certain niche use-cases – it may be the case that some institutions will consider conducting additional proof-of-concepts on them."
Even worse, they may only then use it just for PoCs.
