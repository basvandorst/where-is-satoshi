What part of Africa are you talking about...?  I'm in Nigeria,  and it's gross individual adoption has been nothing less than applaudable! Bitcoin's become so popular here it's incredible. People buy mainly for storage and exchange purposes as its adoption by stores or any retailers is on the decline, so hodlers still have to sell to fiat in order to make transactions.

I was talking about MY EXPERIENCE with segwit. I haven't made use of LN, but I'm certain that  it'd be mind blowing when it starts to get widely used!

Absolutely! There just has to be a mutual understanding of the processes, Like what wallets and exchange platforms to use so as to send, receive and utilize the bitcoin in any form. Just read up on bitcoin exchanges and conversions, and you'd be amazed what amazing possibilities await you and your family in adapting bitcoin for such purpose!

I like this explanation! Very elementary, very understandable! 
@_date: 2018-02-14 22:25:07
With bitcoin, you really can't tell where the top is anymore. It was once 19.8k and just 24hrs ago, it was 8.6k...in order words, it's your risk to take, bro!

We shall all be inheritors of the riches that come with bitcoin! 
@_date: 2018-02-14 15:40:02
Well, let's just wait and see...
But personally, I liked what happened with the 8k mark. If THAT happens with the 9k mark, then we are in the right place, with, I suppose,  very minimum Wall Street manipulations.
@_date: 2018-02-12 11:42:12
Good luck bro! Good choice! $9k is the next stop for BTC! ��
@_date: 2018-02-14 14:55:42
As much as that would be exceedingly exciting, I'd prefer it gets back up with a slow motion. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 14:57:32
Love the flow of this thought/projection! 
@_date: 2018-02-15 09:31:26
WHAT THE HOLY FUCK! ��
@_date: 2018-02-14 15:12:14
THIS is a slow and steady growth! 
It's been nearly 2weeks (If not up to, I'm unsure) since the price swerved off the 6k mark. If the market was going to be an imbalanced boom, as in the precedents set by its movement late last year, we should've been looking at the price being everything beyond the 10-14k level by now!

Hodling for, say,  another month would've given you the joy of your investment, as in, put you "in the money" as you deserved. And yes the trajectory sure does look good. 
And if you aren't so grieved, 9k upward sure does look safer than 11k downward. It's a risk worth taking (again) I suppose!

Who's buying bitcoin big in anticipation for a probable weekend hike? I know I am! 
@_date: 2018-02-12 11:44:46
Not until we cross $10k and stay up there! 
@_date: 2018-02-15 06:08:03
Understandable, time to lick the wounds...totally understandable! You'd be alright though! 
@_date: 2018-02-14 22:27:38
Hahaha...i like the spirit, but let's be real!  Haha
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:07:28
Well, there you go! You're happily making some gains now! Just hodl and we'd all be fine! 
@_date: 2018-02-28 16:30:11
Well, isn't this just nice! This shows that a whole lot of people, me included, are making bitcoin transactions. I made a segwit to segwit transaction yesterday! It was glorious! Coins were received in a mater of seconds in contrast to previous waiting period of mercifully, minutes, hours, or worse, days!
@_date: 2018-02-14 18:05:01
Hahaha...word!! 
@_date: 2018-02-15 06:11:57
It's fine! We're in the crypto currency market after all. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 15:34:09
The perfect time was down at 8.2k, but indeed, this is the right time!! 
@_date: 2018-02-14 22:21:28
 Technicalities have limitations, my friend. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 17:58:47
No mate, just bad timing of things! Sorry for your little lose though! 
@_date: 2018-02-14 15:51:41
Indeed! 
@_date: 2018-02-14 12:47:15
Those experts need pats on their backs! 
@_date: 2018-02-14 12:56:28
Haha! 
@_date: 2018-02-14 15:15:00
Hhaha...Guess your balls are larger than mine! ��
@_date: 2018-02-14 12:44:05
Well,  so far, it's proven to be bullish from the 6.5k mark! 
@_date: 2018-02-14 15:50:31
I'm real sorry for your lose.  But, not to make you feel any worse, apparently you should've hodled a little longer! Doesn't seem the present results would make you any happier! 
Did you buy at the 6.5k low? 
Full Disclosure: I try as hard as possible to buy at every dip, because one thing is for certain, IT WILL GO BACK UP!  
@_date: 2018-02-15 13:49:52
Haha, of course mate! 
@_date: 2018-02-14 15:06:06
Word! ����
@_date: 2018-02-14 15:04:46
I suppose it has dipped enough. This, I mean what is happening now with the price, is the upward move back to its ATHs. We'd experience market fluctuations definitely but still, these fluctuations are going to support the market's rise, not damning it! 
Take what happened with the 8k level for instance...
@_date: 2018-02-14 18:07:45
There's still enough space in that train for you. You can still buy now, and watch it shatter the roof next week!! 
@_date: 2018-02-09 21:49:05
Nice one! I actually had to go back up, have a closer look, and then have a laugh! 
@_date: 2018-02-14 17:57:02
Good man! ��
@_date: 2018-03-01 08:30:04
Exactly!  ��
