Yup! Waiting for the other shoe to fall. This makes every other run this year look like small peanuts.

I just happen to find idioms interesting so I point these things out, not so much a correction as an interesting tidbit to share. Plus, your link actually agrees with me.
He didn't write Hum and Haw. He wrote "umm and ahhh" which is the lexical equivalent of saying "should of" i.e. using something that superficially sounds correct. Yes, I am super fucking fun at parties.

You were actually hemming and hawing.

This is exactly what concerns me. Given the futures on the horizon, this massive gain seems suspicious as hell to me.

What a moment

Coinbase is not for buying 20 euro and selling for 3 euro profit. The platform is not without issues, but it is clearly not designed to be used the way you describe.

It's a dog that has a leaf blower pointed at its face.  
Dog *fucking loves it*. I bet it makes the pup feel nice and cool, what with the lack of sweat glands and all.

No, definitely not. I use myself. But I am aware of the laws of the land I live in.
@_date: 2017-06-15 22:15:55
This sounds like you would like to live I a world where laws aren't a thing to be reckoned with. I feel that's not a very reasonable goal but would be interested in hearing why I'm mistaken

Haven't followed the trial. What was unfair about it? 
@_date: 2017-06-16 02:32:53
Thanks for the detail
@_date: 2017-06-15 23:10:13
Nope, I'm just trying to as an honest question. Not got a lot of honest answers though 
@_date: 2017-06-15 21:58:28
Do people in the btc community thing that guy shouldn't have been prosecuted? Or that prosecutors are villains or something?  
Honest question.

That's...not at all how things work. Juries convict. Prosecutors prosecute. District attorneys decide what charges to bring. 


This is the kind of thing that brings me back to the top i.e. acting like laws aren't a thing. 


I see laws being enforced. Disagree with the laws, god knows I think the drug laws in this country are draconian. But don't act like they don't exist and then be shocked when they're enforced, IMO. "Special Interests served" maybe you could unpack that idea a bit so it doesn't sound like a vague conspiracy.
@_date: 2017-06-15 23:10:26
That'd be cool. 
@_date: 2017-06-16 00:58:30
Seems that way based on the tenor of some replies. 
@_date: 2017-06-16 16:38:00
Probably because Craigslist is used for lots more than just illegal activity and also because when law enforcement made them aware of the exploitation of their platform they took steps to mitigate? 
That's not even a hard one. 
@_date: 2017-06-16 00:57:45
Disagreement does not confer immunity, though 
@_date: 2013-10-03 19:17:24
Yes that seems to be the mental gymnastics at work here.
Not sure if it's more amusing or more sad.
@_date: 2013-10-03 19:07:16


That seems very unlikely to ever happen on reddit.
