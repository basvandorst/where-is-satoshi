Climate change denial is the most surefire way to identify someone is retarded. Even if you believe something as idiotic as that, don't admit it: it lets onlookers know that you are half a root vegetable and that everything else you say should be ignored.

 In 2025 Goldman or China will have found a way to extract every last penny from you in some illegal 50% attack, but I love this meme anyway.

Which is how many this should have gotten.

Assuming crypto doesn't belly up, someone will write a UN statute about them.

Oh boy. Every time I see a delusionally optimistic post, it's you.
I seriously hope you didn't lever yourself to buy BTC.

He's talking about the balance sheet of the US.
Yes, there's $22T of debt. But the US net worth is colosally, astronomically positive. The total land mass of the United States is certainly worth more than $22T, for example.

Do yourself a favor and don't spend the money until you have it. Because if you've been following what's been happening in New York, you should begin to suspect that something is up with Tether.

You should really temper your expectations. Way more people have lost than won on dreaming big in markets, and there is ample evidence of fishy behavior in BTC.

It's about managing your risk. The ultimate realized value is the wrong thing to make decisions on.
@_date: 2019-06-28 11:58:19
That's one risk management decision. But I suspect most of the people choosing to manage their risk that way did not arrive at that decision via a sophisticated viewpoint or method.
Selling and realizing gains is inherently low risk, and "knowledge of trading and markets" is valueless, as the weak form of the EMH is validated time and time again.
You're taking a big risk holding when you could just cash out and take a chunk out of your mortgage. Your choice, of course.

I'm also confused. He's nay saying but talking about a gain of an order of magnitude.
Which is it?

Institutions are net short.
