why isnt he being arrested, or at least investigated? i guess its a crime in whatever country he lives
@_date: 2012-08-17 12:56:54
uh..If you're to throw rumors and then not give any source when asked about it you should just shut the fuck up about it to start with...
@_date: 2012-08-30 06:48:14
ah, i still dont get how it works though, and their website isnt too helpful
@_date: 2012-03-26 04:37:09
interesting read. He makes some valid points, for instance about deflation, but still way over simplifies it IMO. Some parts showed painful misunderstanding of the subject though. And I feel like his mind was set before he did any research and were just trying to make a point, he calls it a categorical scam without really explaining why.


this part made it sound like the author didnt do that much research into  bitcoin though
@_date: 2012-04-17 21:40:08

its just a publicity stunt
@_date: 2012-07-30 16:29:56
you made a very good point in the first part
@_date: 2012-08-17 21:17:33
you rly think the crash was caused by pirate?
Why do people give so much relevance to this guy?
@_date: 2012-04-11 15:14:39
I just dont understand why the harper government would do this. I cant help but being suspicious, this guy always has a twisted objective when he does something, I cant imagine he would give up the control of centralized currency for nothing.

Debt-free currency
However, the biggest development may in fact be the creation of a workable, socially sovereign, debt-free currency called Bitcoin.
Started on January 4, 2009, it already has developed an impressive ecology of operational support infrastructures and services. At this point, it is already working as a small-scale global reserve currency. Bitcoin draws its value from peer-to-peer network dynamics and mints new currency not through debt but raw computational activity. You can buy many different goods and services with Bitcoin, exchange it with other currencies, pay salaries, etc.
It works without any difficulty on a global scale and solves the scaling issues that plagued local complementary currencies. Hence, it is symbolic of the shift of our world system to a "post-Westphalian" phase that goes not only beyond the dominance of the nation-states, but also beyond the private global powers that have hijacked global governance, such as the financial system of the 1 per cent.
It is a true p2p monetary system - perhaps even a shadow banking system for civil society - and exists by virtue of its social creation and the social trust of the global hacker community. It protects their elective communities from global financial storms.
If debt-free money is indeed the problem, then we can now embark on the journey to return to a sane monetary system that requires neither infinite growth nor the impoverishment of many, not by waiting for the agreement of the 1 per cent and their institutions, but by creating the conditions for change on the different scales where citizens can act right now.
