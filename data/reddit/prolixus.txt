But we know from economic theory that is the inevitable consequence of Bitcoin mining being a commodity. Without eradicating the permissionless nature of mining, for example requiring miners to acquire permits from the Bitcoin Foundation to mine, mining pools will naturally converge in a quasi-stable arrangement of that nature.

Yes, the ETN will acquire Bitcoin off of the exchanges to back their notes. If there's enough demand from buyers they'll buy more bitcoin and sell more notes. On the other side if sellers are depressing the price the notes can be redeemed and it will result in bitcoin being sold on the exchanges.

No, if Coinbase's hot wallet is compromised customers aren't going to see any losses. If I have a 1BTC balance on Coinbase that means they owe me one bitcoin. If they lose 1000 bitcoins one day through a hack they still owe me one bitcoin. Unless the company fails completely like MtGox I'm not going to see any loss. The insurance allows them to rebuy so they can fulfill their obligations to their customers in the event of a loss.

Your two best choices are to buy a Mycelium Entropy when it's available for sale: 
Or to buy a Trezor, which is available now: 
The Entropy is a usb device that generates paper wallets and the Trezor is a secure key storage computer that signs transactions without exposing your keys. If all you want to do is store a private key in a safe for a few years the Entropy is probably best, but if you want to keep your balance secure and be able to use it the Trezor makes more sense.

1. Because all the information it needs to work is derived from the Trezor's public key. 
2. Related to the first, the Trezor uses a deterministic sequence of private keys so the addresses are derived in a completely repeatable way from the master private key stored in the device. Your wallet software then scans the blockchain for addresses it knows.
3. No, you'll need to import paper wallet into another program and then transfer the bitcoin to one of the Trezor's addresses.

I think a better direction to focus thought in is rather worrying about an existing pool with too great a percentage of hashing power is hardening the protocol in order to detect and mitigate an attack if it occurs. 
What if China builds a mining pool that has 60% of the current network hash rate and tries to destroy Bitcoin with it? Keeping GHash below 50% isn't going to do anything to protect from a real attack.
What I think would help in resisting an attack:
1. Keep orphaned blocks in memory for a day or two. Allow the user to designate a particular orphaned block as part of the "true" chain so in the event of an attack they can try to ignore the attacker's blockchain.
2. Automatically reject any chain reorganization that would result in a transaction that conflicts with a previously confirmed transaction being confirmed.
3. Automatically reject any chain reorganization that results in more than some specific number of blocks being orphaned at once.
These rules would allow the mesh network to resist an attack and reach a human consensus on the correct blockchain.

Read the blog post. Coinbase is the beneficiary of the insurance, not their customers.

WSJ Money Beat article on BitReserve:

I'm assuming that the quantity theory of money MV=PT (M is quantity of money, V is velocity of money, P is price level, T is real value of aggregate transactions) applies to bitcoin. The value of a unit of bitcoin itself is directly proportional to the inverse of the price level, so B = 1/P, market cap is unit value * quantity so I can substitute market cap C for M/P. Solving for C gives C=T/V.
Qualitatively it tells us that increasing the size of the bitcoin economy is necessary to drive the price up, but this is kept in check by the velocity of money. Which means that a retailer like Overstock that uses a payment processor doesn't increase the market cap because the transactions are offset by the increased velocity of selling that bitcoin for cash.

The US had a deflationary currency and economic growth during the nineteenth century, the only times you had something like a deflationary spiral was in the immediate aftermath of a banking panic, but as soon as things recovered you had economic growth again. Similarly the argument doesn't hold up compared to observed human behavior. 
If the claim that no one will spend a deflationary currency were true then you would never see anyone taking profits from an investment such as a stock that they expect to continue to do well in the future. But people do take profits and spend them on cars, houses, vacations, and other things.
These arguments against Bitcoin aren't based in economic science but are just-so stories intended to promote a particular political position.

To be clear this doesn't allow you to reliably double spend because the Bitcoin network has chosen to not implement Peter's replace by fee patch. His examples only worked because one of the outputs in the first transaction was a known blacklisted address.
Given the current state of the network zero-conf transactions are still reasonably safe if certain conditions are met: low value, proper transaction fee, no non-standard outputs, no blacklisted outputs. The hard part for a POS system is determining the response from the cashier if someone broadcasts an iffy but valid transaction.

Since the Robocoin thread is a mess I'll offer some general thoughts on the controversy here.
First it appears that both companies are in over their heads. The customer clearly expected that they would just receive their order, plug in the box, and start making profits. Pre-ordering first generation bitcoin hardware is always going to be risky and if you can't afford to take that risk you should wait for things to mature.
Robocoin could have saved a lot of hassle by offering to cancel the order for a full refund as soon as they knew delivery would be delayed.
The Robocoin support chat logs that were posted really make the customer look bad. Robocoin support was clearly trying to work with them to get the machine running properly but the customer didn't do any basic set up such as providing reliable internet access prior to installing the machine or understanding how to get their Bitstamp API tokens.
Lessons to takeaway:
1. If you preorder Bitcoin hardware anticipate delays. If you can't handle a delay then wait for the device to be shipping from stock.
2. If you're selling equipment offer a full refund as soon as you know a delay will occur.
3. Don't be unreasonable in your demands or expectations.
