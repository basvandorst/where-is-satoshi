i've just managed to send a tx with total fee of 141 sats:  
but anyway, agree with you.
also, you can make lightning deposits to any (on-chain) exchange, using  or 
@_date: 2019-07-26 06:24:22
Lightning? There is no easy way to determine for you what is my balance, or how i spend my coins, even if you are payment processor. I pay over LN for conference tickets, transaction is not recorded to the blockchain and is not public. Hard to say that transaction is completely private but LN imo is perfect trade-off with very high privacy.

1. post your exchange account BTC/LTC address
2. input amount you want to deposit (0.01 BTC max)
3. make lightning payment and become a part of batched transaction
4. ???
5. you get privacy and pay less in fees

We will see, what will happen :) But anyway, to decrease  risk of fund loss (who knows what may happen) we are limiting tx value to 0.01 BTC. But yeah, you should understand that funds completely belongs to 3rd party (me) while swap is happening in case of using this service.

If you want to get bitcoin over LN this service is what you need.
1) paste LN invoice  
2) make on-chain payment with BTC/LTC/altcoin
3) after payment confirme, your LN invoice is paid
4) fee is just 99 satoshi

Yes, sure. Even big companies like [bitstamp are playing around]( with LN.

There is Wallet of Satoshi as well, but i dont know do they charge fees on top. It seems more like yes.
But, with bluewallet you can easy add  on telegram, by typing /bluewallet command. so you will have custodial wallet (which is maintained by bot developer), but without the fees.

I would say, actually, Libra can be really more stable (and this makes real reason to use it in general) compared to fiat. It is backed by couple of fiat currencies, and in future that may change in any direction (what about backing with FB shares?). But even if we stay with those 4 currencies, I believe that if there are good economists/scientists in the team, they can create really dangerous thing for current financial system - people will choose let's say corporations money, which is resistant to gov. issued fiat inflation...

it actually is centralized batcher. there is a percentage shown on webpage, how much on-going transaction is filled. that depends on current fee market mostly. on average \~7tx on BTC to trigger tx.
That gives you around 85% discount on medium/high-priority tx fee. Such service is very useful, but needs certain amount of users to be comfortable to use. So there is an API, so wallets and apps can integrate.
@_date: 2019-07-08 22:25:49
Maybe some kind coinjoin, but you need then software on user-end i believe(due to nature of cryptography). Anyway isnt that easy to implement.
@_date: 2019-07-08 21:08:01
hmmmmm.. actually very good point! will think how to implement such thing
p.s. you can actually use multiple payments (divide your own into 2-5 txs) so you fill the queue.. omg.. nvm
@_date: 2019-07-08 22:13:02
Those services are related. There is a telegram bot which uses both API. And the community chat is same for all these services :))) even banner on top of each page ;)

Hmmmm.. while i am sure there is automation behind, i think that there are tens/hundreds of human-bots :D because as i noticed, on weekend (out of working hours) there is less downvotes compared to what happens during working days. 
Also, i noticed they are downvoting the whole threads (even was upvoting before discussion started) where there is a discussion which makes look bad their altcoin.
It is interesting, how many users there are actually real. Are they completely blind and don't see manipulation with votes etc? weird..

some time ago i was searching chess-game websites with betting options. i came to conclusion that such projects can't be successful because it is not possible (maybe for now it is, i dont know) to prevent (or at least detect) that player on opposite side is not using automated bots. In such games bots are way more powerfull than humans.
This does not apply to games such as Go, because there are no bots in wide cilculation for such game.

from my personal experience:
Using two types of bitcoin storage - Trezor and Tails LIVE USB (with persistence).
FIrst was using Tails only (pretty secure), for diversification bought Trezor (now part of my btc stored on Trezor, another part on Tails).
Never (for 2+ years) got any problems even with high volume of btc.
First, read about the options:
1) Hardware wallet - 
2) Paper wallet - 
3) Software wallet -  (also: Electrum, Mycelium, Jaxx)
4) For rich geeks - 
5) Live operating system (live usb) - i would recommend Tails  (security hardened and preinstalled Electrum wallet)
So it can be:
1) Plain text on a peace of paper or even steel. The text may be a private key or a seed (human-readable words that makes possible to recreate your private keys). Both private key or seed need to be generated on a electronic devics (in normal use case).
2) A software on your PC or mobile phone. It can be old laptop with new (empty and well-working) hard drive or your old/new phone.
3) Special device called hardware wallet, it looks like a tiny flashdrive for easy and secure way to use and store your coins
Then, you need to understand few simple rules:
0, main one) Use AT LEAST TWO TYPES of storage, they can be the same or in best scenario different. This gives you possibility to recover your coins if something goes worng. shortly: BACKUP YOUR WALLET
1) if you want to store long-term: NEVER use/recover/backup ALL YOUR COINS on a system that is directly connected to the Interrnet (or any online network) or in some way is connected/linked. btw, i am using Tails with connected WiFi thought (so i can send coins). This way is not true for paranoid.
2) UNDERSTAND that absolutely every software may have bugs. Even Electrum or Mycelium, or Jaxx (had security hole few weeks ago, btw using all of these but not affected) or any ther software/hardware wallet.
3) Not only software authors are responsible for bugs/holes, there always is possibility that compromised is your other software on same pc, operating system or even hardware (spy games). The main point is - less software you are using, more secure storage it is (for this reason hardware wallets are most secure digital way to store coins, because there is minimalistic, task-focused low level code/functionality)
4) PAPER/steel wallet still is most secure way to store. DO NOT use/create paper wallet, if you aren't experienced IT-guy, because there are high risk to print it/generate seed in insecure way. For best security you should to create it on a live system with hardened security settings and destroy your printer after printing paper wallet.
5) REMEMBER - virtual machine (when you're running Virtualbox for example) has same security level as your host machine. I don't recommend to use this option for storing coins. Maybe it is usefull in case of sending coins, using anonimized network connection or something similar, not as a coin storage.

I know this :) I actually dont use this app. downloaded and then putted lowest possible rating. removed after.

used Xapo for a while, but one day my card become blocked for no reason.. the main issue was that card was declined while purchasing, but coins in wallet was spent.. wrote to support, pasting answer:
Thanks for reaching out! Looking at the declined transactions, it seems that your card is being declined because you've reached the spending limit set for the card. However, in your case, you actually haven't reached the spending limit yet, which means our card issuer is incorrectly causing your card to be declined. I'm working on this with them, as there are other cases similar to yours, but it could take some time to resolve.
As a suggestion, I would actually recommend that you upgrade your card's spending limits in the meantime. You will have to do it eventually. 
To do this, I kindly ask you to provide a copy of an official ID and a proof of residence.
coins never returned, now xapo asking for account verification and i cant use my card. sent all bitcoins from xapo, using alternatives
Any comments, Xapo?

Mastering Bitcoin is more focused on developers and bitcoin usage in IT world. This book is very valueable, but i can suggest Princeton's book "Bitcoin and cryptocurrency technologies", that gives more "overall" information. 
Link here: *removed the link for pdf* , its very easy to google the pdf if you want. But better buy it. Official link - 
BUT, it is worth to buy both books, seriously. I bought the second one, after reading a pdf :D Authors made great job to bring good explanation of all Bitcoin aspects to wider society. Truly amazing work.
@_date: 2018-06-30 21:57:18
Cool project! Didn't know about that. Big respect for your contribution to the ecosystem! Definetely will try it.
Anyway, it's hard to me to understand in what way 'integration' makes things more complicated in any way. Receiving payments to the wallet via "web-interface" or via "email" makes no difference at some point of processing. You can simply continue to check manually transactions in the wallet and issue tickets via email (which one is asked when paying order) even in manual way as well, while end-user gets easy and pretty way to pay with crypto. Moreover you have so experienced developers.
Of course, it's always up to you to do something or not. And of course, there may be some reasons you dont want to disclosure. But communication with other community members instead of ignorance would be a good step forward for all of us, because we are so tiny part on the global scale and must be united.
P.S. i like very much HH project idea and BH conference as well. great job! keep it doing.
@_date: 2018-06-30 20:50:38
mhm.. i've wrote when ordered tickets that we can provide interactive payment gateway (for free) for you that requires one simple HTTP POST message to request a payment invoice for addresses, where private keys are stored on client (your) side. It takes 10 min to integrate even for person who isn't programmer. More over, we could offer technical advices. Got no response. More time takes manual request processing. c'moon, guys..

THank god someone gets how bitpay is robbing users. I am sure they receive coins already to an exchange auto-sell address. There is no reason to do that other way (as they r describing in their faq)
@_date: 2019-06-05 19:48:50
What a bullshit. where is the problem to receive directly to an exchange address? there is no need to receive coins on temporary address and "move" it to an exchange. it is pointless, i dont think BitPay devs are so dumb that they do so. What they are telling can differ from what they actually do.

Learn about risks and IT security basics. Take a look on wallets and simply try to use crypto, learn how it works from your personal experience.

bitcoin is store of value. use litecoins (change small amount, for 10-15 coffee cups, of btc for ltc) or other altcoins for micro-payments. what's the problem? 
p.s. i am IT engineer and watching the bitcoin project development for many years, just wondering why we need, and why people think we need Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Unlimited, BCash, BGold, S2X and other "bitcoins".  (of course i understand why all these "inventors" need them)

0, main one) Use AT LEAST TWO TYPES of storage, they can be the same or in best scenario different. This gives you possibility to recover your coins if something goes worng. shortly: BACKUP YOUR WALLET
1) if you want to store long-term: NEVER use/recover/backup ALL YOUR COINS on a system that is directly connected to the Interrnet (or any online network) or in some way is connected/linked. btw, i am using Tails with connected WiFi thought (so i can send coins). This way is not true for paranoid.
2) UNDERSTAND that absolutely every software may have bugs. Even Electrum or Mycelium, or Jaxx (had security hole few weeks ago, btw using all of these but not affected) or any ther software/hardware wallet.
3) Not only software authors are responsible for bugs/holes, there always is possibility that compromised is your other software on same pc, operating system or even hardware (spy games). The main point is - less software you are using, more secure storage it is (for this reason hardware wallets are most secure digital way to store coins, because there is minimalistic, task-focused low level code/functionality)
4) PAPER/steel wallet still is most secure way to store. DO NOT use/create paper wallet, if you aren't experienced IT-guy, because there are high risk to print it/generate seed in insecure way. For best security you should to create it on a live system with hardened security settings and destroy your printer after printing paper wallet.
5) REMEMBER - virtual machine (when you're running Virtualbox for example) has same security level as your host machine. I don't recommend to use this option for storing coins. Maybe it is usefull in case of sending coins, using anonimized network connection or something similar, not as a coin storage.

My point was rather that filling node with real coins isn't the only practical usecase. Even using fullnode as a wallet-only for tiny daily payments isnt too rational imho, we have many good SPV solutions out there. But i agree with you that you should run node when you at least understand what you do and have incentives for such activity. Beside technical side, in this case it will be great influence on overall adoption. Learn -&gt; Decide -&gt; Do

even empty node helps network because it delivers verified information to new nodes and allows you to research network activity.
