That's what I'm afraid of. Noone was using Bitcoin for commerce 1 year ago although it was pretty good to use back then. I don't think without onchain scaling it will work (I don't mean bcash)

This is naive on so many levels. 
Right now most people invest in crypto not because of "adoption" but because they wanna get rich quick. Nothing else. Maybe you and me are in it "for the technology", but most people certainly are not. 
Shitcoins are pumping like crazy, hell even doge has a 1 billion dollar market. This altcoin shitshow is gonna come down fast at one point and people are gonna loose alot of money. If you think this will be good for Bitcoin you're delusional.

Blockstream is a profit-oriented company so it's understandable that they prefer a design allowing them to collect fees from users instead of a true P2P solution.
@_date: 2017-02-22 16:50:55
So the number of pruning nodes is an indication for "fake nodes" cause a a real full node wouldn't care about the few GBs of space that the full block chain requires?

Can you elaborate how exactly it changes the game?
@_date: 2017-03-06 21:53:42
Not if the price immediatly halves (or worse)...and this is gonna happen for sure with a fork.
@_date: 2017-03-19 15:40:10
any evidence supporting your claims?
@_date: 2017-03-31 13:07:14
oops. I'm sorry. Probably misinterpreted. SegWit is incorporated in Litecoin core but it hasn't been adopted yet by a majority of miners: 
@_date: 2017-03-27 22:33:54
I seriously don't understand this mentality. This approach might be great for agile development of a GUI-heavy application without much critical business logic. But not for freaking cryptocurrency worth billions of USD! How is it possible that people just don't care whats happening to THEIR money and seriously support devs like this?
@_date: 2017-03-22 21:41:12
wasn't me.
@_date: 2017-03-24 00:14:41
Your argument doesn't make much sense. The pools supporting core/segwit are also profit oriented. If mining on the minority chains becomes harder and therefore less profitable, there is a realistic chance that they won't wait very long and also jump the ship, making the chain even more vulnerable. 
That's why we definitely have to think about a pow change (as a last resort of course)
@_date: 2017-03-13 23:24:55


    
If that's true (hope so) someone should update the list here: 
@_date: 2017-03-05 23:12:23


     
That's perfectly fine of course. But what I mean is, what would happen if all the major miners (=competitors) agree on a common minimum fee to forcefully increase the price of a transaction.
This kind of price fixing is normally frowned upon in a free market and mostly illegal, enforced by government institutions(see [here](    
    
Of course we can hope that miners won't do that. But because they are profit oriented I doubt we can completely rule out that possibilty.

@_date: 2017-03-13 16:44:37
wow. this is so bad.   
I actually believed BU in its core (no pun intended) might be reasonable, that the devs are maybe a bit inexperienced but have good intentions and don't actually care that much about all that conspiracy theory/cencorship bullshit.
But this just proofs they are exactly part of the toxic community that is What the hell, really. I hope all this BU shitshow will be over soon.

To be honest, it's just one big shitshow. Yes, the moderation here is ridiculous. I also had posts removed already. But that also happens on And additionally, on you have a completely toxic community full of hate, conspiracy theories and lies. So although less moderation is happening there, I wouldn't call it a place where open discussion is possible cause whenever someone posts something slightly off the standard narrative, they are downvoted to hell.
    
So yes, I think is the more reasonable sub cause normally the stuff posted here is a bit closer to the truth and base on facts. That doesn't make it a good sub though.
    
So honestly, if you want open, respectful discussion, stay away from both of them. You will only get frustrated.

@_date: 2017-03-24 14:43:11
I completely agree with you. This is the way mining SHOULD BE.
But believing that the big mining pools will all be as idealistic as you is naive.
@_date: 2017-03-06 23:47:14
I have...still so many questions.
So after a fork I basically need 2 wallets? 
A BU wallet for my BU coins and a core wallet for my core Coins?
If I want to transfer core Coins to my friend Bob, what's gonna stop a BU miner from just mining that transaction? If that happens, will my BU coins be transferred or my core Coins? Or maybe both? (I guess my transaction could theoretically be mined twice then...)
Or is there some Mechanism which immediately separates the two chains completely?
    
I just can't wrap my head around how it would actually look like if a fork happens.
@_date: 2017-03-04 01:38:31
In my case there is no immediate incentive to run a full node except "wanting to contribute to the network".
    
If you are using a light wallet, you are basically using the network  provided by other people. You depend that they are doing the job for you. With a full node you are actively part of that network by validating blocks and transactions and relaying them to other nodes.
    
Furthermore, because of the unfortunate political situation around bitcoin right now, running a specific node (Core or Bitcoin Unlimited) can also be seen as sign of agreement with one way or the other.

@_date: 2017-03-27 07:56:03
Joseph Poon was talking about it being enough if every person opens like 2 channels per year. Every thing else would be hidden away from the user and handled by the LN. As far as I understood the user experience would be kind of like a prepaid system. You are putting dedicating funds beforehand and after that you can do whatever you want with them. Sounds pretty straightforward to me, especially if the wallet support is good and user friendly.
@_date: 2017-03-22 20:41:55
Not if you run a node with default settings.

Where is Gregs response? It was there yesterday but now I cannot see it anymore?!
@_date: 2017-03-25 16:29:27


    
No it was not. You didn't explicitly ask about the hardfork and therefore also shouldn't make any assumptions what the people think about that topic. Furthermore you interpretated a 2mb Blocksize support as a support for a hardfork which is completely speculative. Many people could understand that 2mb as the blocksize increase coming with Segwit anyway.

@_date: 2017-03-03 23:38:21
great article!
   
But I'm using a Ledger wallet to store my coins. So I guess it's not really possible to use the node to validate my incoming transaction, right?
@_date: 2017-03-31 07:20:11
@_date: 2017-03-07 00:38:37


    
But why is that? Isn't BU "backwards compatible" to core? ... meaning that every core transaction would be a valid BU transaction as well. Why wouldn't it be possible that a BU miner takes my core transaction and Incorporates it into the BU chain?
@_date: 2017-03-26 16:56:18

dear andrew,
Is there any serious testing happening for BU?
@_date: 2017-03-29 11:12:22
that means given the current situation, there would be an immediate chain split?
Segwit nodes would reject blocks mined by Antpool&amp;co and whereas BU nodes would probably accept them.
Or am I missing something?
@_date: 2017-03-25 14:53:50
Slow down a bit. You do understand that there is a difference between public and personal opinion, right? u/CBergmann is entitled to an own opinion even if his readers don't share that opinion. His article is much more honest than most other "surveys" that popped up lately. I think it actually deserves some praise that although him being a BU-fanboy his survey interpretation is pretty objective and clearly states that the result doesn't match his personal opinion at all. That being said, the part where he talks about the hardfork support is obviously pure speculation and shouldn't be there. That's why I can't follow your argumentation why he suddenly should stop supporting BU just because of this survey results.
   
(I am strongly opposed to BU)

@_date: 2017-03-24 15:58:14
I also think the discussion about it should be more careful. But in the end it's good that the network has this option in case of an attack. And right now prominent BU are not even hiding it anymore that they plan an attack on the original chain in case of a fork.
I feel sorry for you, but it's good that we still have this option in or pocket.

you basically only have to install bitcoin core and probably set up port forwarding. that's it.
      
I don't know about Trezor though. I'm keeping my coins in a Ledger wallet that is not linked with the the full node.

In times like this there is no "common sense" anymore. If you look at the other sub, for the people there it's completely clear that all the nodes were back up that fast because the support (and the commitment) for BU is huge.
    
That's why we need to argue with numbers. Numbers only.

Litecoin's average block confirmation​ time is 2.5min in contrast to bitcoins 10min.
That means litecoin has already 4x the capacity of Bitcoin.

This is such a stupid argument. The same argument is used by bitcoin critics to deny bitcoins usefulness. Just because litecoins adoption is not as big as bitcoins doesn't mean it cannot grow in the future.

@_date: 2017-04-14 22:48:42
no of course not. there are certainly some serious problems.
   
But still I'm a bit fed up of certain people calling bitcoin broken and unreliable. Because it's none of these things.
@_date: 2017-04-10 18:04:48
Looking at the recent developments in litecoin, where it seems like that certain miners drastically increase their hashrate in a very short time just to block SegWit activation.
   
..Why do you think something similar might not happen for a UASF? These groups have alot of money and it should be easy for them to setup huge numbers of (non-SegWit) nodes in a short time.
@_date: 2017-04-28 20:14:51
Maybe. But still it should be possible to have a polite and civilized debate with each other.. 
@_date: 2017-04-02 16:40:49
In fact it does not. After a PoW change all the previous existing hashpower becomes useless and doesn't matter anymore. That's why it can be used to defend a minority hashpower chain against attack from a majority hashpower chain.
But of of course all of this would be highly unfavorable.

@_date: 2017-04-23 01:16:36
How do you define "actual value"?
Litecoin is doing pretty good. Gets traded alot, gets more and more adopted and will have Segwit very soon.
Of course you can stick your head in the sand but that doesn't change the fact that there are other (valuable) things out there. Bitcoins current status and network effect is not god-given and can also change very quickly...
@_date: 2017-04-23 12:48:41
This is disgusting.

@_date: 2017-04-29 08:23:43
Your post might have been true in 2013 but LTC is going to have Segwit soon. Hopefully LN will follow soon. How's Bitcoin doing in that regard?

naaa! bitcoin is broken, haven't you heard?
   
@_date: 2017-04-10 18:36:08
so individual nodes basically don't matter at all? just "important" ones like exchanges?
@_date: 2017-04-24 20:51:52
ok. It didn't work. Sorry to ask too much of you.
Let's try the following:
Imagine 2013. Noone is using bitcoin except some drug dealers. Bitcoin is a joke in the public opinion. Everyone's just laughing at bitcoin because its "not real", a scam and a pyramid scheme. And most of all: you can't buy anything with it anyway. What good is a currency that you cannot use to pay with, right? Some people even make claims like "Bitcoin has no adoption and it never will!!!111".
     
@_date: 2017-04-02 15:31:38
But a UASF also requires a hashpower majority if we don't want a chain split.
@_date: 2018-02-04 09:54:29
I don't think anything changed honestly. Most Bitcoin related news was and still is about the volatility and the dangers of investing in it. I believe most people knew what they were getting themselves into and knew about the risks. So once price rises again, it won't be any different.

Dude... calm down. Let's stay civilized without any personal attacks, ok?
      
It's NEVER ok if certain parties try to force a protocol change onto a community which does not support that change. And at the moment that doesn't seem to be the case.
I don't know if 2x is gonna be successfull but even though the majority of nodes is running core at the moment (and won't magically update as you stated correctly), there is a chance that the majority hashrate in combination with a few key players (exchanges, payment processors) will in fact successfully take over the bitcoin "brand". 
I don't think and don't hope this will happen, but it is certainly possible.
And no matter how you look at it, this change won't be induced by the community, it'll be  forced onto the community.

take a closer look at vertcoin.
it's pretty close to bitcoin but with asic resistance as main focus.
IMO most of bitcoins problems come from the extreme miner centralization.
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:45:17
Yes. Like Heroin.
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:04:30
That's actually pretty high.

Except for the dumbfucks selling their coins now. Srsly who is doing that?
@_date: 2017-10-23 15:44:32
Sorry if I wasn't clear (english is not my first language).
I didn't want to say that bigger blocks will put the power into the hands of a few important people.
What I tried to say was that the upcoming hardfork (2x) might result in this centralization of power. 2x was decided by a small group of miners and other big players (exchanges, payment processors) but is not widely supported by normal users and node operators. If you look at the node statistics, you will see that very few users actually run 2x nodes.   
     
Bitcoin is supposedly a decentralized, cencorship resistant network. If a few big players can just come together and decide the fate of bitcoin without any community suppoert, that means the decentralization doesn't exist anymore.

@_date: 2017-10-23 08:16:51
Biggest risk is 2x in my opinion.
If it succeeds it might mean the end for Bitcoin as we know it.
Not because the fact that it is a block size increase but because it would mean that a few important people can do whatever the fuck they want.
@_date: 2017-10-23 15:29:50
I think you have a wrong perception of what core can or cannot do.
People can decide anytime to run different software.
Furthermore they never tried to push a hardfork.

@_date: 2017-10-23 20:13:53


Maybe my description of the possible outcome was exaggerated. That's not at all what I was trying to say.     
     
Regardless, I do believe it's a very bad sign for bitcoin if a small group of individuals can force a hardfork, although there is obviously no community consensus about it right now. It means bitcoin is ALREADY far too centralized.

it's just politics.
     
Miners want Segwit without admitting that the existing solution (bip141) recommended by core was the right way forward all along. With Segwit2x they can kinda save face because now they get their "compromise" including a hardfork (even if it's unlikely that a hardfork even comes...)
