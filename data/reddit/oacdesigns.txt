Congrats! Next level up is to go into a place and physically buy something with Bitcoin ;)
We're quite lucky here in the Netherlands; there's plenty of pubs, cafes, and restaurants that let you buy your food and drink with Bitcoin.

You could look into using node WebKit to make it easy for any merchant to install and use this like a normal desktop application. No need to know how to run your own server.

hey, no worries man. 
The "wallet PIN" is so you don't have to type your full password every time you want to send bitcoins. It makes the wallet easier to use without making it completely insecure - someone else wouldn't be able to send your bitcoins if they got hold of your phone without also knowing your PIN (I guess there should be instructions on that screen to explain this).
On the setup screen choose 4 or 5 easy to remember numbers, and repeat them in the second input box to "confirm" them.
Here's a screenshot for you, hope it helps.

Hey, I'm one of the developers so I'm afraid I might be a bit biased....but I'll try and highlight some of the differences in an objective way for you (and apologies if I'm making any assumptions about your bitcoin knowledge).
**Firstly are the features...**
on the mobile app we believe we have created a very user friendly interface that we hope should allow anybody to start using bitcoin. We have some nice features that blockchain.info lack, such as the ability to send to contacts in your phone without having to ever request an address from that user (one is generate automatically for their wallet). We also use the names and profile pictures of your contacts so you can easily see who a transaction was sent to or received from. 
Another nice feature is on the transaction display. You can see what the value of the transaction was at the time it was sent, and compare it to the value now to see how much it has grown/decreased in value in your local currency.
The wallet also supports bitcoin URIs, so if you click on a bitcoin hyperlink it will launch the app automatically and fill in the address and amount on the send screen. We also have dynamic fees integrated, so when someone decides to do a stress test on the network your transaction will still have a higher chance of getting into the next block.
What else....we're multi-platform ( iOS, android and web browser...like bc.info), have a qr scanner in the app, generate new addresses automatically whenever you go to the receive screen (which you can copy, email or sms to someone). Oh and you can specify the amount to receive and the generated QR code will include this.
**And now the technical aspects...** 
Firstly bc.info is not an HD (hierarchical deterministic) wallet. So for every address you generate, you need to backup the private key separately. If you ever lose one of those backups you have no way to recover the funds held in that address. You also end up with an insane amount of backups (as you should not be reusing addresses, and generating a new one every time you receive funds).
With our HD wallet you can create a near infinite amount of addresses and only ever need a single backup of a master private key.
Another advantage to using HD wallets is that we are able to generate new receiving addresses for a wallet without even needing their private keys. This allows you to never have to reuse addresses (which is bad for both parties' privacy) and still be able to send to someone without needing them to manually generate an address and send it to you.
Then there is the fact that we're using multi-signature technology, 2-of-3 to be specific. There are a lot of security advantages to multisig and features that we'll be able to add (such as spending limits, kill switches, address whitelists, etc) that will help you have greater control over your bitcoins and security against theft and hackers. It also means that you can use blocktrail as a service without ever having to give us access to or control over your bitcoins, and if anything were to ever happen to blocktrail you'd still be able to access your bitcoins and send them to another wallet. This includes if we get hacked. The hackers wont have enough information to do anything to your wallet, unlike with bc.info in which case they have an encrypted private key which they could brute-force attempt, rainbow table or use some other method to crack and then empty the funds in your address.

I've been meaning to give Kraken a go, just haven't gotten round to it yet. I've heard good things about them too. I need to check out their fee schedule, and see what kind of tools they have first (Bitstamp has some really nice tools for limit orders and trailing stops)
Bitstamp also lets you so SEPA transfers, so no problems if your European. I also find it easier to deal in dollars when it comes to Bitcoin (just a personal preference) as a large amount of media and other Bitcoin services are US based.

Blocktrail just released a new Bitcoin wallet for android, iOS. You can download it, create a wallet, and use their special launch promo code "moon" to get some free Bitcoin deposited directly into your wallet.
You can also paste an address here as mentioned already, and i'm sure people will be happy to send you some starter coins :)
Good luck,
And welcome to the world of Bitcoin!

I've personally had a great experience with Bitstamp. Made some money, lost some money...all in all I've found it to be a good place to experiment with Bitcoin trading, or just get your first Bitcoin investment.
You can do a bank transfer in a couple of business days, and then instantly place a buy order. 
Once you have your Bitcoin I would recommend you withdraw it from the exchange (incase they get hacked/go rogue) and keep it safe in a wallet you control...and make sure you keep a backup of that wallet! 
Then, a year or so down the line when you want to liquidate your investment, you just transfer the Bitcoin back to the exchange, wait for X number of confirmations, and then place a sell order. Once your Bitcoin sell (pretty much instantly, they have good volume) you'll do a USD bank withdrawal from Bitstamp back into your bank account.
Of course if you want to do some active trading (i.e. take advantage of Bitcoin's volatile price and buy and sell every couple of days/weeks), then you're better off keeping some/all of your Bitcoin on the exchange so there's no delay in placing the sell order.
By the way, the startup I work for just released a multi-platform wallet app that gives you a HD wallet so you only need one backup document to recover your entire wallet and all future funds. Also it's multisig and gives you full control over your wallet, so if we get hacked or disappear from the face of the earth you never lose your wallet of the bitcoins you own.
I hope you check it out:

something you could do, until the bug is fixed, is sign up and create your wallet through the web version. That'll let you download the backup sheet directly to your computer. Then you can log in on your phone to load up the same wallet.

hey, I'm one of the core developers working on the wallet app.
We will be releasing the source on Github this coming week.

I think OP must be European. A lot of countries here use a comma instead of a decimal point (I have no idea why...just to confuse the hell out of foreigners I think)

Hi, one of the app developers here.
You're right, a lot of the permissions aren't even used by the app (some may have been added in when we were trying out experimental features). We're going to go through it and remove as many unnecessary ones as possible.
When we open source it we'll also explain exactly which permissions the app uses and how it uses them.
Just to go through a couple of the ones you mentioned:
Contacts: one of the wallet's key features is the ability to send to your contacts. The wallet needs to check if a contact has an existing blocktrail wallet (using a hash of their phone number). Then when sending to a contact it uses their phone hash to request a new bitcoin address for you to send to. You can choose not to sync contacts during the setup process (we'll also be refining this feature, possibly allowing people to disable syncing at a later date and remove all synced data)
Photo and Files: Access to Photos to allow you to set a profile picture, something your contacts would then see in their wallet when you send to them and vice versa. Access to the storage is so that the backup pdf can be temporarily stored on the device to allow you to open/save it in another app or attach to an email to email to yourself.
Camera: as you mentioned, to scan QR codes and also to take a profile picture.
The others I believe should be getting removed as they are for features we probably won't be implementing any more in the app.

I took the photo here in Amsterdam Zuid, below the train tracks in the commercial district (all the huge banks and their sky scrapers are just around the corner).
Caption from the Photo:
"Bitcoin enables freedom from traditional currencies and financial structures, including their controls and abuses, their corruption, and the suppressive nature of those who control them. With bitcoin you have the power to transfer value in an unrestricted, trustless and private manner. This photo captures the frustration of people in regards to fiat currency, and provides the solution: Bitcoin."
