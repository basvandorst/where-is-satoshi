It hasn't yet.  Only when they refuse to change there corresponding bank to one that 'accepts' crypto, then it will have changed.
In this case a third party has screwed over ther credit union IMO, and they have a chance to change and make things right by ditching the third party.  It's only when they fail to do that when they will stop being good in my eyes.

Well, with a credit union the 'bank' is owned by those who have deposits and loans.  So it's not like a stock market listed bank in the same way.

at some point, you can expect a different method of cashing out to appear for uk customers.  No need to be beholdent to coinbase as transfering crypto from one exchange to another is a very simple thing to do!
So as long as you don't think the government will crack down on all UK fiat payments from exchanges longer term you should be ok (that's the approach I'm taking at the moment)

I've been with nationwide since I was a child, and my parents have been with them thier my whole life.  They have been a great credit union.  I'm definetly going to try and get them to change to a different correspondent bank before leaving them with none of my money

Huh, interesting!

No not really, states want people to use their paper money as a medium of exchange much more than a store if value.
I do agree with your other point though.

isn't it nessasarily difficult to keep a lightning network open for years.  You'd need consistent internet, consistent up time and that's not going to be secure due to zero day discoveries.

Who is this H who I trust to make payments to me?

coinbase is insured bro.  It's safer than any hardware wallet

Nah, shit like bitconnect exist

so will this not be more useful only for larger entities that often transact between each other (like say Binance and Coinbase).  
As I can't reasonably have enough funds to have many open payment channels.
It would reduce on chain load, but there would still be a block space premium.

Only if people belive in it as a store of value. If people start only wanting gold for jewelry and not hoarding its value would plummet.
Also, you aren't supposed to (by design) just keep your dollars or gbp and hold them fit face value, so it doesn't really mean much as a comparison
