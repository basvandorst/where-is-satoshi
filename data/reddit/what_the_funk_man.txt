Ok, that is true. But it is a new wallet.dat.
The old one may still exist. There is no rule that says when you create a new file, any old ones with the same name will disappear.

Their problem is that they do not yet know enough. They know what they only what they are told. I saw a recommendation for Paypal as a form of electronic cash.
Of course, we suffer from the opposite problem.

If you are being serious and not just fishing for tips then you need to stop using your computer immediately as there is a chance for you to recover your wallet still. 
Any further use of your PC will increase the chance that your wallet.dat will get overwritten. Right now it is probably NOT overwritten. The system has just tossed the info that allows it to know where on the hard drive it is stored. 
Again, if you are being serious, stop using your computer immediately. Get a recovery program onto a USB stick and use it to find your wallet. 
If you are just fishing for tips then stop wasting our time.

If using that program I believe there is an option for a 'deep search' or something of the sort. That might make the difference. 
If not there are, I believe, better working programs for what you are intending to do.
Alas, this is where my knowledge of this area comes to an end.

Better to scan the whole hard drive, instead of just checking in a certain subdirectory. There is no telling where the remnants of the file may be.
Once done, limit the search to just .dat files. If it exists, you will find it.
It may take some time, but if it works, it will be the easiest 1000 dollars you will ever make.

The mouth of Karpeles is stronger than any other current forces acting on the Bitcoin market.

That's terrible news. It seems as if the BTC are gone forever. 
It may be in your best interest to disregard what I said and research more advanced ways of restoring your data.
