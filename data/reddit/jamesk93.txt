Im trading from the UK but Im guessing its the same right? For the life of me I cant find it on the site. Do you mind giving a step by step on what to click on to get to it?
EDIT: Right I have [found it]( but it is greyed out for some reason. I have my passport verified and my driving license.

Do you mind walking me through that? I have coin on Coinbase and also block chain Id like to transfer across. GDAX seems like the best place to hold and sell if I want

what about technology improving to help mine faster meaning that it might be less than 100 years?

The reason I want to buy off GDAX is because Ive heard it has lower fees than Coinbase for buying. If they are both linked, is that still the case?
How do I go about topping up my wallet with USD on Coinbase then sorry?

Nobody knows what it will do

Off topic Q about GDAX - For some reason, I cant buy off the site. It keeps saying I have insufficient funds when I have my bank details in my Coinbase account. Right now I have just been buying off Coinbase which is annoying since they have expensive fees. You know what the issue might be?

If I had the answer to that question, Id be a Multi-millionaire by now 
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:46:33
Verified as in have I uploaded my ID to them to check? Yes, I have. I have been buying from Coinbase but Id like to start buying from GDAX due to there being less fees to pay but it doesn't let me

I need to top up my Coinbase wallet with USD to buy from GDAX?
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:38:55
Is there a way of seeing my coin on GDAX that I have bought on Coinbase? or would I need to transfer it over? Is there a fee for that?
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:52:08
It was doing that for me and I closed it and it was all fine. Just check to see if you got your confirmation email maybe before you do
