Yeah and pretty much everything stated in that review is not correct. There are definite reasons why the author posted that, competitors paid him off maybe?

A trap? The bitcoin community most have some paths they are afraid to share. The fuss about not wanting to prove who you are is comical.

I totally agree with you. Most of these comments here are stupid and naive.

Why? are you hiding something? You must have bad intentions if you can't upload a piece identification after making a series of deposits? The utility this company is bringing to gold is phenomenal and you're whining about not wanting to prove yourself after depositing? Come on, son... are you 15 or what?

Hey Holographics, shame on you for trying to deprive a clear and great response from BitGold. Bullshit excuses? There was no excuses in the content you meathead. It simply states they follow standard KYC and AML policies (without disclosing information of case of that specific user.) Do you have a bank account? How would you like it if someone hacked your savings and the bank just said "Oh well, nothing we can do... see ya later" Shame on you for lacking basic thought and substance in your previous post as your totally discrediting the fact "KYC" evaluation serves your best interest unless your a thief.

I have never had an issue... upload a piece of identification and your set to go..  this ruckus is totally unnecessary and a typical move by  scumbag writers here. Maybe this person  was some heavily sought after criminal that deposited his/her bitcoins and finally got caught?  wouldn't that be great news to this community?  probably not. Most Bitcoin bugs are  going to wreck this movement due to unprecedented  deceit/ and swarming hatred towards anything that is in competition with your mathematical token (which I own btw)..
You should actually appreciate "KYC"  policies  as its out to protect you not get you.

I find this all absolutely ridiculous, I am a long time bitcoin supporter but I am very disappointed with the community that is being shaped around it. Just because a company doesn't operate under the blockchain/has a central authority you automatically assume that the entity is at fault.  I have been a bitgold user for months (alongside coinbase) and have never had an issue, personally depositing over $7000 and successfully withdrawing or spent (on prepaid) the amount as well.  With regards to this case it's pretty evident (with anyone with a brain) that the user that issued the hit piece on bitgold was not being KYC compliant which is a no-no in any financial institution that isn't decentralized. It's quite evident that none of you have conducted any  due diligence on this company.   
Let get back to talking about bitcoin.

valid points.. but I do not see the problem with just uploading a piece of identification to prove who you say you are? It should not be a big deal, when I first started I loved that I could just sign up and deposit 20.00 and just learn about the platform (send,receive,requesting prepaid card to spend, redeeming in physical gold).. before buying larger amounts of bullion *Then subject to upload ID ... Your dealing with physical gold bullion here fully reserved with them picking up the storage costs... Btw, I don't think they treated the customer bad. By the sounds of things he/she was breaking protocol which needed further investigation.

what happens if the authorities were checking in on this user due to illicit funds? then what?  what would you be saying if the accused funds  that bitgold  is withholding were actually yours deposited by some random dude you never knew?  would you still be saying that there is no merit to them withholding these funds?  they went public to address you scumbags...  which obviously was a waste of time on their part because most of you are  anti-anything that isn't fully decentralized…

and your a moron. it's very easy to understand the way this company functions. Simply upload a piece of identification once you hit a certain threshold, get verified status and you can successfully redeem and deposit fluently. 
maybe instead of following the herd here,  you should check out the company and expand your brain by first fully learning / understanding the company  before you make senseless  remarks

They only take the funds if your subject to an investigation or have not submitted sufficient documentation to prove your identity. I have never had a problem in my months of using the service | I love how you emphasize so greatly on [[ "How about making someone verify all their bullshit BEFORE generating them a deposit address" ]] what the fuck is the big deal.. just prove your identity?(for your safety.. and 95% lose if they  verified before deposit? LOL- 1% over spot is unprecedented to acquire gold. They would be more then fine    ... this is a finite encrusted element we are talking about here not some finite mathematical digital token...  
@_date: 2016-06-03 02:44:33
once you  finalize your sign up  your automatically agree  to its terms and service (like anything).  like you say it's not rocket science,  I don't understand what your premise is here. defending a dude that probably got caught due to illicit funds?  why are you so touchy? is it because you do this with bitcoin? 
@_date: 2016-06-03 03:58:50
What barriers? you must be riding the coattails of the original post as once you achieve verified status (do you even know what that is pal?) you can quite easily extract funds from the network. 
@_date: 2016-06-03 04:42:40
Read the t/s before then? I lost some gold but i understand they are not going to just hand out the centuries best performing currency without some ROI.. Don't trust service? that's fine. me and 1,000,000+ do and deriving huge benefits from the platform. Your loss.
