Not bad indeed.

Dat's a weird comparison. Niche doesn't mean no market though. Only that it's not for everybody :)
@_date: 2015-04-06 15:01:25
Indeed you can. But you cannot find an exceptional whiskey at that price.
The whole point of this is to offer only a very few whiskeys, but selected carefully to be exceptional. Then, everybody have different taste, but a quality whiskey will have notes that makes it unique.
Feeling the notes requires education, like for coffee or wine. Most people can differentiate good from bad relatively, but nothing more. I would not recommend to offer a $1000 bottle to somebody that don't know whiskey, of course.

Why that? :) I do actually
@_date: 2015-04-06 14:00:07
I can prove you wrong, dear sir!

That username looks familiar...
@_date: 2015-04-06 14:05:38
True. And OP didn't says it's a "business" as such, more opening a shop by and for whiskeyholics.

Alcohol has always been popular

That seems to be the majority of posts here :) I don't understand why people all think against niches, especially here.
Premium products are especially good for niches. Bitcoin here is a tool, no chargeback on a high value/online purchase good is really not negligible.
But you might be right!

Guys, you are amazing. We might seriously make this happen :) Thank you Reddit!
@_date: 2015-04-06 14:29:06
Thank you sir!
@_date: 2015-04-06 15:35:40
Competition is good!

Never said we weren't drunk.
But I do believe lot of choice and low price is not what our niche is about. Offering 3 whiskeys, at 3 price range, from very limited batches. Every time a batch runs out, we source a new one.
It's not for the common whiskey buyer though, talking of rare stuff here. Bitcoin is just a way of payments. I posted here to know if some Bitcoin users were also whiskey drinkers, I was wrong, but that's the all point of posting!

To push the troll: you can find specific whiskies in other regions, from other malts.
For example the EDDU, in France, 100% buckwheat

maybe indeed. Or maybe we can do it better, but that's not the topic here, it's not an investor pitch.
@_date: 2015-04-07 00:21:09
Maybe selling when it become good enough. In about 15 years? :D

Let's say a "cheap" quality bottle, at around $300, would you buy? For a gift for example, or for personal consumption?
@_date: 2015-04-06 14:42:18
Indeed, who would imagine a whiskey topic starts a troll on Linux :D
@_date: 2015-04-06 13:59:28
Yes, it's exactly a niche market. I did not say Bitcoin only though.
When dealing with high quality products, it's better to keep a community approach, as you can exchange with your clients and build a relationship much more easily.
Bitcoin in that case is a great form of payment, as whiskey is a low margin product, and the risk of chargeback is high as it will be high value transactions.
