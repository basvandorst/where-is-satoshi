Hey Crypto556, thanks for all info and answers.
I have another question, from looking here,  ,  Electrum,  BitcoinWallet and breadwallet all have the same level of control, security, validation and so on, is there any benefit that separates one from another, or is it just user preference, seing that they all three are so similair?
I might keep coins on an exchange, but i think using a real wallet, whether it is on PC or smartphone might be something i'll do so i can see how a actual wallet work =)

Hey streeetcornerkid, thanks for your input.
I appreciate any answer with advice on how i can proceed with this, thanks! =)
I will see, the idea of just buying some € worth of bitcoins and make some long-term saving on USB or similair and looking back in a few years sounds very appealing, i might do this regardless if i buy/sell anything for short term now.

One extra thing: Should i never ever mention what wallets i use, what coins i have or the amount?
I know PC can be valuable and cold-storage are always best, but since my amounts of € were so small i felt comfortable sharing with you, but maybe this is naive/ignorant/not relevant to the topic?

As i said in post i have a few dogecoins and have secured them in case of computer loss or house fire, but thanks for mentioned it, taking precautions for things that might happen is allways good. =)
