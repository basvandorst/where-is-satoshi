Since I agree with you and am always trying to poke holes in my own beliefs, I've got a question to add to the argument :)
Hypothetically, is there a threshold where this no longer becomes an issue?  The bitcoin network could become so valuable at some point that no asset in the world would be worth more than destroying the network correct (assuming the asset was stored on the main chain and not some less valuable sidechain, extension, etc)?  Or is there some aspect of the game theory I'm overlooking and it's fundamentally a bad idea at any level?

Not trying to start a war here, and I'm definitely not an expert, but I don't think you're understanding his argument.  The issue he brings up IS a protocol issue, fundamentally, because it skews the game theory.  Bitcoin is designed in a way that makes attacking the network a huge financial disincentive.  He's saying that hypothetically, if there are assets represented on the blockchain that are more valuable than bitcoin itself, it may then be worth it for someone to destroy the whole system just to gain access to them.  It's not about protecting the value of bitcoin (well, I guess it is at least indirectly, in the sense that if it doesn't work as a protocol it will be valueless lol), it's about making sure bitcoin stays secure.
Like I said I'm not an expert so I couldn't tell you if he's right or wrong about this, but either way I think it's a really interesting point that I haven't really thought about before.
