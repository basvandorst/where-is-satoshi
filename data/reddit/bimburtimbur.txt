next thing you know you will be claiming its anti semitic when someone states something factual like jews owning banks or the media.  both are true. 
and saying either of those things gets you labeled as anti semitic.

IF you can trust Trezor.
I think a Piper Wallet device is the safest way to store bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-12-23 20:44:12
I may not.
I was originally told bitcoin would not have fees I remember this.

mind explaining why you are not concerned about this?  when you say handle transactions wouldn't there be bitcoins stored on the private keys within the trezor?  and then my trezor keeping track of these transactions?  Or am I incorrect that when you use the Trezor device with Mycelium on your phone that MyTrezor part cannot see that transaction?
Are you storing your coins in cold wallet (off computer on printed out wallet say from bitaddress.org )  
and then when you need to spend you transfer X needed funds into the trezor's keys?
And then complete the transaction with Mycelium using Trezor?
Is it that you don't trust Mycelium, and want hardware wallet?
sorry for so many q's.  I just want to secure my bitcoins.  I like keepkeys 12 word seed.  trezor is very trusted.  but then ledger is really cheap.  not sure which to get.
then there is piper wallet which seems the safest but kinda impractical unless you don't mind printing out a to of paper receipts and then shredding / burning them.

*People often claim that with Bitcoin "you can send money between any two points on earth for free". While that is true in some cases, sometimes a transaction fee is required. The fee, when it is required, is usually worth less than 40 US cents.*
bitcoin transaction fees are to high now if you use priority...

When I thought about it Piper Wallet, but its expensive so I have held off on purchasing it for right now.
basically a rasberry pi attached to a thermal printer.  You can hook it up to a monitor if you need to make passwords for BIP, or need to configure the paper wallet.  Or it can operate without a screen attached to it where you just press the button and it generates a random public/private key and prints it out.
so they are charging you like $200 or so and their cost is like $110 perhaps less. 
it is an off line computer (rasberry pi) that can print you out ALL types of wallets 
    *Print BIP0038 encrypted keypairs with a manually entered password
    Print bulk wallets
    Print unlimited copies of wallets
    Generate vanity addresses and set the address prefix that Piper will use when generating your keys
    Split your keys (or any secret) up into n-of-m shares using Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme
    Add new alt-coins that are not already present on Piper
    Use Armory or Electrum as a cold wallet
    Create paper wallets using the local copy of bitaddress.org
    Print miscellaneous text or encode and print as a QR code
    Choose to print traditional addresses or BIP32 addresses
    Print anything using your own USB printer*
*Shamir's Secret Sharing is an algorithm in cryptography created by Adi Shamir. It is a form of secret sharing, where a secret is divided into parts, giving each participant its own unique part, where some of the parts or all of them are needed in order to reconstruct the secret.*

One of the things that attracted me into bitcoin is that I would receive bitcoins, the customer could not issue a refund, and there would be no "third party" in the middle jewing me down so to speak.  
Now Bitcoin charge the customer a transaction fee, essentially allowing a third party to jew down my potential buyer.  Who in turn could pay me with Visa / Amex / Mastercard and get CashBack savings reward, can issue chargeback etc.
I want to do business.  And if customers choosing to pay me with Visa / Amex / Mastercard and get CashBack savings reward well Bitcoins aren't helping my situation by charging this fee to customers!


Does this benefit the "third party" miner more so then the majority of bitcoin users?

I know that all the transactions are recorded on the blockchain.  but they don't know who owns the keys.
With MyTrezor do they know you own this key , that key, the other key etc by keeping track of the keys you use when using MyTrezor (or maybe some how all the transactions get routed through MyTrezor)

It didn't use to be like this and having no transaction fees would have allowed me to have **more** customers when there were no transaction fees.  
Now this is not the case, and it in fact cost my customers more to pay me in bitcoin.  They can't take advantage of the cash back offers from the visa/amex/mastercard etc

KeepKey has a 12 word seedkey.  So you can just remember those 12 words, then wipe the device, restore the device from those 12 words etc.
That way your private keys with your bitcoins only exist in your head.
Trezor is more trusted but way longer seedkey list , 20 words.  and has small screen compared to keepkey's nice OLED display.
Ledger is cheap.  i don't know enough about it.. can you inform me or link me?
did u go with ledger over trezor or keepkey?
I do like how slim ledger is.  but are your transactions getting tracked with a ledger?
@_date: 2015-12-25 17:06:29
Other than the cost why didn't you go with KeepKey?
Are you worried about being tracked through MyTrezor or through the device some how?
@_date: 2016-02-03 02:37:21
take a look at piper wallet
you can create keys and then chop them up into three parts so that the key will not work unless all three people bring their part of the key together

2) exposure: Linux is far more widely used
This doesn't equal a more secure operating system.  If no eyes are auditing the code, just because a lot of people are using it doesn't mean anyone is actually looking at the code to make it secure. 
Is Linux really secure out of the box?  Or is that something they just proclaim.  
What code has come from Linux into OpenBSD's base operating system?  Now what code from OpenBSD has gone into Linux?

I am a bit worried about sighning up and geting billed .02 bitcoins or whatever if I just want to be a reader i.e record myself reading articles and then uploading them hoping i get upvotes on your site and then bitcoins
i wish there was a way to make a records yourself reading account vs a normal listener account
because once the trial ends i don't want any btc i earn being eaten up by fees.  I just want to read.  I don't even want to listen to the audio other people record.

what are the steps of doing it right. 
i went to bidaddress.org
when you say have the skills
how do you manually send bitcoins from one address to another from the command line interface using your private key.
should you send out chunks from your private key and the chunks being the amount you want to spend to other private keys you make for example at bitaddress.org
then spend those chunks by sweeping the full amount
?
