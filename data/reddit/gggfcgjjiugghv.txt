There's the time warp attack to increase block frequency.. could go to 1min blocks.. especially once everyone has gigabit fiber and 5g.

If it's not a replace by fee, it probably won't get propagated by most nodes that saw the first one, but you could send it directly to a miner and maybe they take it.. or else you could mine it yourself. A simpler way though is to broadcast both transactions at more or less exactly the same time to different parts of the network, ideally half sees one and half sees the other. You can't really control which spend ultimately gets confirmed, but you can be sure that half the network initially saw one transaction in their mempool and then saw it invalidated by the other one being mined into a block.

Really hard unless you're one of the top three mining pools. You don't need 51% either.. they regularly score 4 blocks in a row.. so really at most they just have to be able to pay for a few days mining effort while attacking.. maybe could do it for $2m.. but it might be tricky to structure the double spending such that you won't be attacked through the courts for "stealing".

Banks are kind of in trouble anyway.. branches are basically going away, so you're just left with a website and those don't actually cost much.. various startups have done it (replicated online banking) for a few mere 10s of millions.. they can't charge for basic banking when startups are giving it away and with noone going into the branches it's hard to pressure people into buying unnecessary insurance and other such nonsense.

Well it's the dirty coin sender's channel partner's problem not the payment recipient's. The solution will probably be to kyc your own channel partners.

Maybe some kind of paid blogging / vlogging platform.. like YouTube but with micropayments.. lots of people make a living that way, and maybe with micropayments it could expand a lot more.. I guess some jobs will exist to support bitcoin technically and integrate it into new products, but that probably won't really be a huge number of jobs.. maybe similar or less than currently exist (there are tons of startups, most of which will go bust).

Tbh I thought the website was clear, whereas this clarification isn't. Presumably if the price is at 2.00001x at loan maturity you nolonger get the full value back. It's basically a leveraged put option.
@_date: 2019-01-12 07:02:13
So how do you know if your payment was delivered if there's no preimage of the invoice hash? I assume the recipient still has to be online? They just sign something with their nodeid that says they got a payment for some amount?

Each loan will be pegged to a price ceiling at loan maturity, meaning the secured collateral will be redeemed for USD payable to the borrower if the price of the pledged collateral exceeds the price ceiling at loan maturity (for example, the price ceiling of the loan program ideal for Bitcoin holders will be between 1.7X and 2X of the Bitcoin price at the time of the loan).
So if the price goes up more than 1.7x you lose..

That isn't exactly how it works, the recipient always receives BTC from their channel partner.. they choose to set up that relationship. The sending BTC are not related to the BTC received.

Onchain atomic swaps do not anonymize your coins as people can scan both chains and see which utxos were swapped.

Assuming you are genuine and not knowingly shilling for the "Ross project" just keep an eye open and maybe you'll see it. On the other hand many people have built successful careers supporting lies whether knowingly or not so maybe it doesn't matter to you anyway.

Too bad about the fees
@_date: 2019-01-21 10:52:43
For the purposes of exchange funding, it probably doesn't much matter.. liquid does have more or less instant blocks and the big disadvantage of liquid for BTC is that you can only withdraw real btc by going via an exchange.. but with a stable coin you could only ever do that anyway. Erc20 may be good if you want to interact directly with a smart contract without using the atomic swap protocol and the same can be said of other blockchains - if there were some other asset there that you wanted to trade against onchain. But for centralised exchanges it makes no difference what chain each asset is on.

What sort of "things"? I mean I could read the src, but I'm pretty lazy.. and probably won't. Lots of people are lazy.

You're thinking of a sidechain.
@_date: 2019-01-02 22:39:59
No. The two transactions just need to conflict by spending at least one of the same inputs. The miners could choose to use the higher fee transaction if they see it (but they might not - it's entirely up to them) and they might not see it. If you just broadcast both at the same time most likely most miners will only see one or the other transaction so the miners that saw the low fee one will continue mining it. If you send both transactions directly to all the main mining pools then yea they at least have the opportunity to use your high fee tx but maybe some of them still won't.
@_date: 2019-01-11 09:52:18
That won't help much since signatures are already segregated.

@_date: 2018-12-26 17:55:58
The recipient only really has to be happy with the payment and reveal the secret.. they could choose to do so for no payment at all if they wished. There may not be any rendezvous nodes currently, but I guess you could just falsely advertise a normal channel to the recipient that doesn't really exist in order to make it work with the current src routing. I enjoyed reading your thoughts on fees.. I guess the fees will always have to cover expected volatility, which could really limit the use of small cap coins.. could be an area where bitcoin does have a real tangible advantage. Thanks for the detailed reply
@_date: 2018-12-25 14:39:04
It actually isn't. When you pay a lightning invoice, there are not BTC addresses in the invoice, it is a ln node endpoint identifier. You have no way of knowing what currency the recipient is using.. all that's required is that there is a path of payment channels that will commit to delivering your payment to them. The nodes along the path may in fact be converting the payment from one currency to another at each hop.. there's no way you can even know, so yea ln is basically compatible with every Blockchain, or even centralised payment systems.. there's no fundamental reason why banks can't issue invoices that pay into their accounts.. as long as some node is willing to do an exchange.
@_date: 2018-12-25 17:12:52
Yes, I kind of said that BTC might end up being the standard denomination.. but that assumes that some other ln like system doesn't become dominant.. obviously bitcoin ln will always use BTC and if everyone else integrates with and uses BTC ln then all invoices will be in BTC, but someone can make a different ln with some other base currency that bitcoin could also integrate with...
@_date: 2018-12-26 08:41:36
Again I'm not sure what point your disagreeing with or trying to make..
@_date: 2018-12-25 20:41:58

So has Ethereum in raiden.. but neither are as widely deployed as the BTC one.
@_date: 2018-12-25 15:27:14
If you want atomic swap guarantee then yea you need some compatible smart contract like functionality, but if you don't care or trust your bank then that would work too. If you had a payment channel with an exchange using bch then you might trust your exchange to not mallate your transactions and (less likely) they might trust you at least for some small amount. Bch can't be mallate by random 3rd parties anymore, just by the channel partners maliciously re-signing a transaction (it requires access to the private key) so if you trust your channel partner it's safeish.
Of course there are many coins that do support offchain smart contractual type transactions such as litecoin and any other bitcoin derived alt that implements segwit.. and of course etherium and it's derivatives and probably Eos and nem although not sure tbh. Anyway those should more or less work perfectly with ln. Really, the only thing where BTC might have a slight advantage is if invoices standardize on using BTC denominated invoice amounts... I could see that happening, but I guess there's no hard reason why, other than it needs to be something, and right now it's BTC.
@_date: 2018-12-25 20:32:55
It doesn't have to be. Your wallet can have an LTC payment channel and pay an invoice denominated in milisatoshi as long as there is some node willing to route a bitcoin payment for equivalent LTC. Similarly the recipient of the invoice might be paid in some other currency. Also all the hops between them could be using Ethereum. Just because the invoice is denominated in satoshi doesn't necessarily mean there are any satoshi.

@_date: 2018-12-25 18:56:30
The unconfirmed bitcoin transactions are exchanged bilaterally with your partner.. each one updating who owns how much of the payment channel utxo. At any time either party can drop the current most up to date transaction on chain and after a certain number of blocks it should confirm without the other side having to do anything. These unconfirmed bitcoin transactions are bilateral and are never shared with anyone unless they are published onchain.
@_date: 2018-12-25 18:15:14
They don't move beyond you and your partner.
Edit: what does get passed around is the payment proof which is a preimage of the sha256 hash in the invoice. This hash is used in the smart contract locks, so it's part of the bitcoin transactions but it's only the hash and preimage that get passed around, so basically any Blockchain that can verify a sha256 is ln compatible.
@_date: 2018-12-24 22:00:19
Imo it won't be a big deal.. but later some settlement problems may be uncovered in traditional banking and we can look to this and say hmm maybe Blockchain is better..
@_date: 2018-12-25 18:03:41
It doesn't pass them around, you have a channel with a partner. You give your partner a bit of your channel if they can deliver your payment. You don't know how they do it, they could visit the guy with a bag of cash.. but they have to get a proof that the invoice was paid or else they don't get the part of your channel.
@_date: 2018-12-25 09:09:23
It breaks offchain transactions.. that is transactions that haven't and might not be committed to the ledger. If you want to make transactions that spend another uncommitted transaction you need to be sure that the transactions you reference can't end up being committed under a different txid that doesn't match the one you used. You might not be able to create a new version of the transaction using the new txid since it might require a signature from another party who might not be around anymore or uncooperative / adversarial.

NFC is a wireless protocol usually used to communicate with sim cards. In order to pay for something usually the payment terminal attempts to access a visa/MasterCard app on the payment card or an emulated one on a phone. AFAIK most phone oses such as Android and iPhone don't make APIs available to developers to emulate the payment app. Only certain blessed apps are allowed to do it. You could make a root access app to present a prepaid debit card number, but obviously that isn't really a path to a useful product since few people would be able to install it. Maybe someone will do it anyway.. but otherwise you're waiting for google pay, applepsy, samsungpay to implement it. You could add a real bitcoin debit card to one of those apps (maybe). 
It would also be nice to not use the visa / MasterCard SIM app over NFC and instead use native ln. That would require support on the merchant terminal side too though, so it might take a while before that's widely supported. Again though I'm not sure if enough nfc functionality is available to non-root developers. The normal BTC payment request over NFC just uses NFC URL/tags which are easily available through standard APIs but it's only able to communicate a URL in one direction - from the NFC terminal to the phone.. you could probably do something crude that just takes you to a btcpay checkout page, but then most of the interaction is taking place over the internet and not over NFC.
It might also be possible to setup your own Telco and issue your own SIM cards with a payment app on the SIM. I think phones will allow the SIM enough access to the NFC even though phone apps don't! Maybe virtual Sims could offer a kind of backdoor here too.. like install a second virtual Sims that isn't even for talking to a Telco but just relays payment app requests back to an unprivileged phone app

There are some other situations.. for example people frequently make chains of transactions by sending to a wallet and then sending from a wallet before the first transaction has confirmed. With tx malleability, anyone who just wants to fuck with them can mallate the first transaction and cause the second one to fail.. not a big deal in most cases, but mtgox did actually lose a few hundred or maybe even thousand BTC to this kind of attack, because their software mistakenly resent the apparently failed transactions. You could maybe do something similar by exploiting human gullibility as a con artist.. and at best it's still pretty annoying that random assholes can fail your transactions unless you wait for each one to be confirmed first 
@_date: 2018-12-27 16:35:13
Looks like it's out of date.. prior to Android 4.4 and the introduction of host card emulation it was more or less right.

You will probably discover that you can't transfer from TransferWise to a bitcoin exchange. I would suggest converting it to euros in your revolut account and send that to coinbase by sepa. You could probably use GBP now that coinbase supports that if it's easier. Basically you probably can't do much with USD in a TransferWise acct. I'm not sure if revolut USD would be any better as it may not show your name when sending to the exchange.. also coinbase may not accept USD for non us accounts (not sure). If you really want to avoid converting to GBP or EUR I would say open a real foreign currency current account at a high Street bank and send to bitstamp.net by swift.
