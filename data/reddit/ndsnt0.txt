Is an anti-trust lawsuit launched by the btc foundation against apple mature enough for you? I find it funny that when suits throw mud at each other, it's "mature" but if it happens on a forum board it's called childishness.

We entrust the government to manage money. If they become corrupt &amp; influenced by corporate interests &amp; then work AGAINST us, who is going to point it out ? The only group that benefits from a bitcoin ban is the current big players. Read that sentence again. There are laws against stiffling innovative new technologies &amp; they are breaking those laws but since they write the laws, no-one will come knocking on their door.

@_date: 2014-04-13 00:06:21
exactly! One blockchain is a single point of failure. Plus you can't have a 30 second confirmation sidechain running on the btc blockchain because bitcoin is 10 minutes per confirmation, +/-. You couldn't have a different hashing algorithm either since bitcoin miners hash SHA256 only. There a lot of things sidechains can't do, altcoins are here to stay.

Hmmm, This is news to me, I mine Darkcoin on p2pool. On darkcoin.kicks-ass.net:7903/static/ p2pool node... (1) Even the tinyest CPU miners will get on the payout list within a day or two &amp; then get regular payouts according to their hashrate contribution. (2) Tracking services are plenty &amp; as good as any centralized pool. Even better because it is all on the one page &amp; all p2pools have the same standardized, easy to view stats. (3)  I *do not* have to run a node, I just join an existing one. There are tons &amp; it's easier to set up than a centralized pool because with p2pool you do not have to register, you just receive payouts directly to your coin address. I'm surprised it would be such a different state of affairs with bitcoin... Are you sure this is the case ? P2pool has a 5% or so percent of the hashrate on Darkcoin.

hehe it's a milestone when starts hating on drkcoin. A seperate blockchain is *absolutely* necessary. Darkcoin is mined on computer graphics cards, just as btc was 3 years ago. A single point of cryptocurrency failure is not a good strategy for us to have. Drkcoin is *not* a coinjoin copy, the darkcoin devs are developing the software that is darksend. Masternodes will allow anonymous sending for all. Not as an after-thought as it is with bitcoin, but built right into the foundation of the coin. Evan is an extremely competent dev &amp; the price increases reflect poeple's faith in darkcoin. Drk may soon eclipse the lite... Cryptos are one family - darkcoin's innovations  help the entire cause of decentralized money. Darkcoin is *not* Bitcoin's enemy.  lol

There is no borderline about it... You are using logical fallacies to smear a well spoken member of the community. That's the only weird thing here. 
Rights apply to everyone, even "wealthy men". Bitcoin, if it isn't banned by the Ben Lawskies of the world, has the potential to bring financial freedom to the world's poorest people. You should be ashamed of yourself, causing trouble here when you obviously don't "get bitcoin" &amp; are attacking Bruce's Rosa Parks comment when this IS an issue that will directly affect the portion the world's population whose rights are the least respected.

CAvirtEx does the same sneaky BS, my coins were frozen for a month while I proved I was Canadian. But only to withdraw BTC, if you want to deposit they will take everything you want to send them without issue. If you ever want your coins back, you have to jump through hoops. If you don't they flat out admit they will just keep your coins. Too bad. This is theft ! whether it mandated by the government or not, it's still theft. It's high time for decentralized autonomous exchanges to appear on the net which don't answer to these government racketeers. Seriously, this is not OK.

That's because there is no GUI &amp; no-one is sending coins.

edit: wow, just wow, I DO own moneros &amp; I do like darkcoin. Knowing that you are a well known altcoin hater &amp; flamer of the Doge sureddit I'm acutally happy that you've now become an altcoiner... I still think you're a really talented flamer &amp; very skilled at being an asshole, but it's nice to see the King of altcoin bashing end up buying altcoins. I guess the fact that you are even in this thread pumping Monero means a victory for all the people who have had to endure your shit these last months... &amp; I guess it means you're word is BS cuz the very thing you harped on endlessly about ie: altcoins are shit, has been proven false. Welcome to the altcoin world you big hypocrite, glad the "BigMoney" has finally arrived. :)

Thats a bit harsh IMO. Bitcoin is just the name brand, Satoshi's revolution is the technologies underneath which altcoins share. Bitcoin &amp; altcoins are like flavours of Linux. They all improve the space by allowing experiementation &amp; variations on the main btc theme. Darkcoin has just implement anonymous transaction which bitcoin is still working on... The is enough money in the world to support many blockchains... 1 blockchain = 1 point of failure, so Altcoins play a vital role IMO.

Thanks. I feel that discussion &amp; setting our intention to organize &amp; come up with worksarounds IS the solution.

The reason our opponents are so powerful is because they ARE united &amp; organized. We can be too. 
I just want to let this community know that I, for one, will not accept a bitcoin ban. This technology is too important for the world to not stand up for it. Bit License is illegitimate, whether is becomes law or not.

"More surprising than Amazon's limited effect on the local economy is the work itself. The people of Rugeley are not happy. One local said, "The feedback we’re getting is it’s like being in a slave camp."
Amazon's warehouse employees walk a lot. They walk between seven and fifteen miles every day. These aren't casual walks, either. They're high stress, high pressure walks.
Employees carry around little handheld gadgets that look like calculators. Those gadgets tell the employee where to go in the warehouse to grab what needs to be grabbed. Simultaneously, the gadget is measuring the employee's productivity. If you're slow, Amazon knows it. If you're taking a break, Amazon knows it."

I was told if I couldn't prove I was Canadian they would simply keep my coins. what a joke.

In all fairness this could read "I don't see the reason they would go after us." With all due respect to everyone's intelligence here:
1- these agencies are *not* accountable to the public in *any* way.
2- Our views on what they are &amp; what they do &amp; why, is taken from pop culture &amp; the society around us. (friends, family)
3- It's been revealed that they are involved in social engineering. 
Add 3 &amp; 2 together... Your view of "our boys" has likely been influenced, perhaps even shaped by those same agencies. Just pointing out the obvious, that's all.

Monero's worth investigating, but not cuz this FUDer/speculator is pumping it. (disclaimer) I own monero.
@_date: 2014-07-24 22:48:58
too hard. 
ok. 
@_date: 2014-05-09 23:40:44
LOL good one :)

It's an open source project &amp; the devs are not releasing darksend until it is finished.
@_date: 2014-04-10 21:52:20
lol, what agenda do you have I wonder...
@_date: 2014-05-16 13:29:18
Great ! signed &amp; shared.
@_date: 2013-12-10 11:48:38
I feel what you guys are doing is *incredibly* important &amp; is not likely to be fully appreciated until we are further down the road.  I have no questions for you, just Thank You's. Many, many Thanks to Cody, Amir, Vitalik &amp; team. Keep it up.

I feel that most of the world's BS started with "common sense". Religion may be corrupt, but there is more to this life than just trying to get more than the next automaton...

i was enjoying this sub until i got to your "cry baby didn't see this crash coming &amp; now has to take all his rage out on the rest of us who've been enjoying this sub, jokes &amp; all, for a long time. A few Sparta Hold memes, with mandarin subtitles, would've nipped this crash in the bud, but no!, we gotta look serious so others will also buy btc, shiiite. chill out, if not for your own sake then for ours. Some of us increased our btc holdings during this very predictable crash &amp; I'm happy &amp; want to laugh. I could give a rats ass about conversion to fiat. :)
@_date: 2013-12-10 18:15:03
Great news, Thank You Friend.
@_date: 2013-08-05 16:32:11
I guess it's "common sense" if you seek to increase your profit at the expense of the next person. If you look at it from a higher perspective, there are a finite number of us on a very finite planet, if usury/interest is permitted, that extra money has to come from somewhere ie: not everyone will be able to make their payments because the total amount to pay is greater than the total amount in circulation. This is why usury is immoral, because it guarantees mathematically that someone somewhere will end up holding the bag. That's some people out there cannot afford to eat, it's all connected. As bitcoiners *should* know, the numbers don't lie. check out internet vid "money as debt".

WOW, just checked out Bitcoiniacs, fantastic job ! easy bitcoin buying without bank transfers, waiting to be verified or giving personal information... Please open one of these in every major city... of the world I guess. Be safe, dont let the banks find out who you are or they'll just close all your accounts without any reason given. Be safe, &amp; why not post the fact that this store exists to the main page, this is big, good news. You guys deserve your 5 minutes at the top of r/bitcoin. I shouldn't be finding out about this while diggingn thru comments. :)

He is paid by those thugs to defend them. He's off duty at parties &amp; hence just a boring guy.
@_date: 2013-12-07 13:40:50
*brilliant* thank You
@_date: 2013-12-25 13:40:49
still, not bad... Could you write out the Sanskrit version with just one mistake?
@_date: 2013-08-31 21:04:40
I support this 100%, it's very important that this comes out. Be safe.
@_date: 2013-12-17 02:52:01
positive or negative or both, it's by design &amp; it's being done. The math doesn't lie. It's being played off as incompetence but they're not stupid. Bitcoin is a floating city that just happens to be cruise alongside the sinking titanic.
@_date: 2013-12-05 22:11:41
9 months ago this comment would *not* have been downvoted to oblivion. I fear this subreddit will be overrun by greedy day traders &amp; clueless bandwagon hoppers. This subreddit has been populated by *very* intelligent techies &amp; idealists. Time to slide over to r/agorism, while it's still listed in the sidebar...
@_date: 2013-12-14 17:59:59
I'm a "conspiracy guy" &amp; I fell in love with bitcoin at first sight in 2012. I'm also a life-long techie so I "got it". Alex Jones is a zionist shill fear monger. Decentralization is what we need &amp; it's what the old guard would fight if they could figure out how... 
@_date: 2013-12-08 01:43:21
VaultOfSatoshi is Excellent. I do miss LibertyBit though... I suspect the bank that shut them down will ensure they never return.
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:19:20
ya, you're a big asshole altoid. Censorship sucks period
@_date: 2013-12-15 03:06:09
Coinion is great ! love the Obamacoin piece the most lol
@_date: 2013-08-24 01:29:10
&amp; a nice garden :)
@_date: 2013-12-05 22:18:38
Flailling Junk has a point. 9 months ago this subreddit had the highest concentration of *brilliant* techies &amp; idealists while the rest of the world laughed off bitcoin. I'm seeing a high influx of greedy clueless bandwagon hoppers. (not saying you are one) But the intelligence of this subreddit has been dropping as fast as the price has been rising. Just saying, no offense to you please.
@_date: 2013-09-16 17:51:58
Good for you ! Have fun, secure our network &amp; you just might make a nice profit after all !
@_date: 2013-12-23 00:04:25
Excellent, great service, thank you. So tired of proceeding to cart only to read "sorry we can't ship your item to this country..."

Awesome thread, I also followed the r/worldnews bit earlier today &amp; loved to follow 17chku4u pepering the commenters with tips &amp; intelligent, interesting comments relating to btc... Good job community.
@_date: 2013-08-24 01:37:22
There are plans for decentralised user owner/operated mesh networks  that when deployed sufficiently would give bitcoin &amp; the internet no central point of failure or censorship. Please support one of these projects if you can, they could be vital for btc &amp; the internet as we know it in the future. 
@_date: 2013-08-16 01:02:14
We need our own hardware/infrastucture... Satoshi ! help...
@_date: 2013-12-10 04:03:21
Same here, HTC One please.

Not to get too sidetracked, but this is also one of the reasons Gadaffi was taken out. He was spearheading a switch to the golden dinar for a large part of Africa. -Why is truth always voiced into the void?
@_date: 2013-08-28 19:31:45
WOW bring this out ASAP Fantastic ! this, when released will merit a Nobel prize, the sooner the better seriously
@_date: 2013-12-14 02:55:06
Stefan's last 2 videos on bitcoin are some of the best btc vids yet IMO. I think the non-aggression principle is key to a sane, safe &amp; prosperous society. I find myself in agreement with him 99% of the time. His entheusiasm for bitcoin mirrors my own. 
@_date: 2013-08-28 19:12:54
Music producer here too   :) great stuff Oscillicious !
@_date: 2013-08-24 01:26:18
Good for you, it *is* the devil.
@_date: 2013-12-13 15:44:46
no-one can legislate bitcoin, only the exchanges are vulnerable &amp; decentralized exchanges are coming. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 23:16:17
Santa's invested.
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:22:50
circumcise your own intelligent debate, shill !
@_date: 2013-12-11 21:48:45
lol, really? I remember libertarians &amp; discussions of a stateless utopian future but maybe I'm guilty of projecting my self into the world I see. Maybe it really was memes &amp; omg $$$'s the whole time. Either way, thank you r/bitcoin, you've changed my life.
