Is coinrebates legit?  I can't find any reviews.

I second this question.  I wanted to do this too.

Based on your responses, I would be surprised if you have any investors.  You seem to not know much about the regulations surrounding the flow of money.

For the stock market, yes.  For btc there's not enough data (just a few years)
@_date: 2016-11-17 16:09:24
No leads, sorry.   No btc atm either.  For a big city, that seems weird.

Interesting logic but this doesn't sound as bad as politicians offering entitlements or tax breaks "if they win"

I collect currency.  Sometimes I resell.  The best way to do that is buy in bulk.  No way in hell would I ever mess with foreign govts currency.  That's a good way to get killed or jailed.  Seriously, I'm interested

Yep. I already checked there!  I hope someone takes you up on it.

I'll pay double and shipping.  Where can I buy bulk currency?

It's another loophole for politicians.  They can buy votes and we can't, just like they can do insider trading.  You're blind if you don't think rule  of being a politician is setting a different set of rules for yourself and your colleagues.

Fomo, time to sell

Cool!  Where'd you get it?

Crap chart.  You'd miss out on two huge run ups, just hold.  In addition there is now red on the chart but it is on the legend, wtf. 
@_date: 2016-11-17 01:33:53
Minneapolis still nothing though

So has every shitcoin.

Great info, thanks

Interesting.  I understand how they'd be able tax from transferring to fiat - Most places that do it would require the forms be sent to the govt.  If you just buy something, though, how is that tracked?  Is it on the user to self-report?
@_date: 2016-07-19 15:04:24
Do you pay gains by transferring back to fiat, by spending on goods/service, both?  Anyone have experience with this yet?
