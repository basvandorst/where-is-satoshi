you should educate yourself a little more about the notion of validity of blocks
as for your completely false claim about "anyone can spend" - go ahead and try to spend some! You would be so rich!!!
The reality is stronger than words, you know :)
Face it - there are dozens of 0.8.1+ nodes happily working on bitcoin network. Look up yourself 
@_date: 2018-01-10 23:28:50
the point is not to accept any block
the point is to accept ONLY valid blocks
in this way bitcoin is still the same - only blocks which were valid in march 2013 are valid now
So the money people store are still the same

Сеть баров KILLFISH, начавшая прием криптографической валюты в середине декабря прошлого года, заявляет о немедленном прекращении приема Биткойн. 
27 января 2014 года, Центральный Банк недвузначно разъяснил, что сама природа криптовалюты противоречит правовому режиму РФ в силу своей бесконтрольности ( 
Более того, согласно официальному письму Банка России, предоставление российскими юридическими лицами услуг по обмену «виртуальных валют» на рубли и иностранную валюту, а также на товары (работы, услуги) будет рассматриваться как потенциальная вовлеченность в осуществление сомнительных операций в соответствии с законодательством о противодействии легализации (отмыванию) доходов, полученных преступным путем, и финансированию терроризма.

@_date: 2014-08-11 18:21:04
And they have pretty cool description
explaining what bitcoin is, with funny remark at the end:
Make up your own mind: In the opinion of Carl-Ludwig Thiele, board member of the Bundesbank, Bitcoins are highly speculative goods and it could therefore - as with other speculation - in the worst case a total loss, as there is no government guarantees. Meanwhile, there are many millions worldwide proud owner of the digital currencies, believe the opposite and a high penetration rate, high gains and a digital revolution predicted.

because BTC-e offers several simply ways for exchanging russian cash into bitcoins
Beeing in Russia, you can literally insert some money bills into one of thousands of terminals placed overall in major cities, and only minutes later transfer you bitcoins out of BTC-e
By the first time you use a specific way of adding funds to your account, BTC-e places timehold on withdrawals (1-3 days), but after that it just flows.
This kind of operations got harder since the bitcoin ban by russian central bank, in the first line you have to pay larger fees, but in my opinion BTC-e already enables transfer cash to bitcoins in Russia comparable to bitcoin ATMs, which are only starting to be installed in Canada and US

he could sell bitcoins for ~40$ at that time, as you can read in the topic

He was a pioneer of GPU mining back in 2010 as well. Really an incredible man! 
@_date: 2014-02-14 18:17:48
for example btc-e had withdrawals closed for about 1-2 hours, and after that - back to the business as usual

Under 30% SegWit
Over 40% BU

again - it can try this, it's called 51% attack.
There are countermeasures to this, POW change is the ultimative one
@_date: 2017-03-22 10:56:29
No, miners are just nodes with special hardware.
Nodes are network.
Each full node does  validation and will just reject invalid blocks no matter the hashrate. 
And nobody in the world can coerce a node operator to specific client if the node operator doesn't want it.
You seem to miss the central point of Bitcoin, so I won't listen to you.

It does indeed
@_date: 2017-03-26 12:21:04
You spotted it perfectly indeed!
@_date: 2017-03-26 00:30:45
sure, but it this form it is even more impressive
@_date: 2017-03-18 10:51:24
Well, let's consider.
No, Bitcoin has to be trustless, with no central point to attack.
One, two, three or even 100 data centers ARE points to be attacked by state actors, so centralized miners who are preparing to "kill other chain", that is to coerce us the people to use their service are NOT in Bitcoins best interests 
Or have I missed the /s tag?
@_date: 2017-03-28 12:34:42
They have enough hash power to block SegWit, but not BU.
So they will protect Bitcoin against 51% attack by BU camp.
@_date: 2017-03-25 23:46:29
it will not be me implying it
it will be comunity of users, who know that
1) the unique property of bitcoin is censorship resistance
2) if you need paypal 2.1 you can have it without blockchain at all
@_date: 2017-03-22 11:01:14
As the events of last year clearly show, the unwillingness to compromise with technically inadequate proposals is a vitally important feature of Bitcoin reference client development team.
@_date: 2017-03-26 00:23:42
and there are already 11 visible nodes if this flavor
@_date: 2017-03-25 20:49:23
good point!
If I were a miner, I would start do it now.
I even had the idea of buying mining hardware and start mining with intention to lose some money on electricity while helping to protect bitcoin. It's a shame I am too lazy
@_date: 2017-03-13 12:35:33
If fees are high, then the network is actually used. So it cannot be called "unusable" seriously.
@_date: 2017-03-21 22:39:05




no, it doesn't.
It only means BU has more than 80% hashpower.
If BU uses it to fork from network consensus, it creates an incompatible chain and so is altcoin. 
If additionaly BU-camp tries to "kill the weaker chain" as suggested by some of their members, it is performing 51% attack on Bitcoin, leading to all forms of countermeasures, up to POW change.
In neither case is your suggestion sound.
@_date: 2017-03-17 22:18:08
Latest events show to me that core devs were indeed right about the dangers of mining centralisation 
So it could be good for bitcoin in the long run, while clearly painful to watch at present
@_date: 2017-03-08 08:22:29
If the Custodian, in consultation with the Sponsor, is unable to make a conclusive determination about which Bitcoin Network has the greatest cumulative computational difficulty after forty-eight (48) hours, or determines in good faith that this is not a reasonable criterion upon which to make a determination, the Custodian will support the Bitcoin Network which it deems in good faith is most likely to be supported by a greater number of users and miners.

any news about the deal?
@_date: 2017-03-25 23:19:08
I'm sure if there is an attack by BU-camp (or any other centralized group of adversarial actors) and bitcoin has to protect itself by POW-change - mining code will be again included into the client.

Centralized decision making is exactly the problem Bitcoin was created to solve.

It seems like the corporate take-over is under way, with contingency plan named Bcash is already installed by the same party.
It is a pity. 
If Bitcoin can survive this - it will be really great!

At the moment 
BTC 3100$
BCH 245$
Bitcoin is THE crypto currency, while
Bcash will go to nearly zero in under a year
Have a look at history of XT, Classic, EC and other previous takeover attempts - they just fade away
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:11:54
Well, there seems to be an misunderstanding.
Sorry for it.
BCH is an altcoin.
Segwit was implemented long time ago and could be used for 20 weeks already.
But some miners blocked it, until UASF movent threatened them with chain split.
To save face, some men in suits made NYA to copple Segwit with block size increase - against 100% of Bitcoin core developers.
So Segwit will now be activated, but the hardfork to 2MB in November will be an altcoin or an 51% attack.
@_date: 2017-08-18 13:43:51
in this case Bitpay would have to make it clear the suggest to switch to btc1 client
Instead Bitpay lied about "uprage necessary to use segwit"
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:05:19
As for "politically motivated" - I just don't like the idea of some (incompetent) politicians decide behind closed doors to overtake Bitcoin.
BCH is an altcoin, I wish mr. Ver best luck with it

You know, some men in business suits can agree on pi = 4.
And European Parlament recently decreed that cryptocurrencies cannot be anonymous.

Nice read, isn't it?
Exactly as you say - "longest chain" in the whitepaper is always about valid chain.
Bitcoin ist 100% opt-in: nobody can decide for a user which client to run.
So "NYA" ist completely against the spirit of the whole thing, and if the miners decide to try to overpower users - well, it is in the whitepaper as well, under the name of "51% attack"
@_date: 2017-08-21 18:59:36
found it for you
@_date: 2017-08-01 09:50:44
You seem to be misinformed.
Bitcoin is longest VALID chain.
Validity is not decided by some men in suits in some back room.
It is decided by consensus. 
Presently consensus is defined by reference client - see nodes statistics.
No concensus of USERS for change - current status quo is valid, so 2x will be a miners attack to subvert the network.
@_date: 2017-08-16 15:17:45
And publuc reviews are unimportant because?
@_date: 2017-08-18 21:08:59
I really enjoyed reading your post, thank you very much!
As for this comment - I wish I would be so optimistic about the outcome of S2x take-over attempt!
If I do remember right, there were all kind of talks about "killing the original chain" and "sabotaging it for the greater goods of the users" from miners and Gavin. And the decision to not implement any replay-protection seems to go in the same direction.
@_date: 2017-08-18 20:40:11
Segwit2x is an attempt to steal the name, yes.

@_date: 2017-08-18 13:20:46
english is not my first language, sorry!
I am genuinely curious.
I see the situation as extremely dangerous - we are witnessing not just another take-over attempt, but the first one which has chances to succeed, that is - to destroy Bitcoin as trustless system of wealth storage.
The fact that over 90% of mining power with quite a lot of exchanges and payment processors like Coinbase and Bitpay had signed an "agreement" to take over Bitcoin name, label and source code and force all users to switch to their node client of choice is threatening to the existence of Bitcoin.
At the same time there already is Bcash - as a go-to option for the time of uncertainty. Controlled by the same party.
So - it would be good to know, how we users are going to protect our freedom.
At the same time I understand, that it is dangerous to prepare for this fight in form of open source project with public access.
So there is this contradiction.
One point is clear - to use Bitcoin I have to run my own bitcoin full node.
I will do so as soon as Core 15.0 is released
@_date: 2017-08-29 08:21:26

Thanks for your commitment and faith in VB and Co, but I'm not sure this will actually help, if and when it becomes necessarily ))
I'll prefer to stick with trustless model of Bitcoin.

Perhaps they do understand how Bitcoin works?
Mike Hearn didn't, and so he rage quit.

So 1 fact (Coinbase) 1 assumption (poloniex) and many thoughts.
Doesn't look really fact supported to me.

The will wait for 20 blocks on Bcash chain to make sure it will not reorganize.
While Bitcoin is irreversible, Bcash can experience reorgs of arbitrary depth at the moment.
Do you just have to wait until ViaBtc thinks the possibility of reorg is low enough
@_date: 2017-08-07 21:25:35
well, no
1) at the moment  show support %%
Segregated Witness (SF) 87%,
Emergent Consensus 23%,
SegWit2x 21%
2) more important - we don't need "unification". We need trustless system. No way some men in suits can decide for me what client to run
@_date: 2017-08-05 05:49:23
Ad 1: no mistakes!
If you had BTC at the moment in time Bcash was created, you now have BCH.
Read the OP for instructions how to sell it 
@_date: 2017-08-19 07:19:04
The community would reject such update, yes

Any sources for this rather strong claim?
@_date: 2017-08-29 12:36:29
nice collection!
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-08-05 00:18:22
so you actually sold BTC for BCH?
If so - you are my hero for today in "counter-intuitive handling"!
Would be fun if it would work out for you!
@_date: 2017-08-18 13:29:21
I don't agree.
Bitcoin core development team made greatest effort to upgrade Bitcoin network in an backward compatible way.
Up to now everybody was free to use ANY version of bitcoin client, starting with Satochi's - and it would work.
And here comes the NYA-cartell and _forces_ everybody to upgrade in order to use something they WANT us to call Bitcoin.
How is it - "no force"?
@_date: 2017-08-25 10:02:49
This is the power of backward compatibility!
@_date: 2017-08-07 11:53:09
Good point!
@_date: 2017-08-02 19:21:00
All previous attempts were for the name and network effect of Bitcoin.
Bcash is an altcoin with the same address format and transaction history as Bitcoin plus two-way replay protection.
Hardfork to Segwit2x in November will be the next attempt by the same group to get the name Bitcoin usurped at last
@_date: 2017-08-16 15:38:59
"at least" cannot be 2/3
"at least" means &gt;=1 year
For example 8 &gt;= 1 is true, so it could be 2,3,5 or even 200 years))
@_date: 2017-08-04 20:58:56
You see, SegWit actually had pretty overwhelming support. 
Over 80% measured by coin.dance

Now the money is gone on 4th of August
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:19:59
It was never about storage OR bandwidth.
It was always about centralisation of mining.
Which is bad now - see how miners just decide for everybody that we have to change the client we run?
So - no forced hardforks for free people!
@_date: 2017-11-25 06:45:31


The 2X fiasco showed 100% clearly that miners have no pull.
@_date: 2017-08-06 22:13:06
dear you keep speaking about "overwhelming support for 2x"
Please clarify -  shows only 21% support by industry! 
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:40:21
and deliberately NOT using segwit - like shapeshift 
@_date: 2015-08-04 20:06:47


what? "no fees"?
What should that mean?!? They are NOT SIGNED properly!!!
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:44:49
Well, "nobody is using segwit" is just false.
10% of transactions already use segwit.
And now, with B2X attack cancelled, developers at all Bitcoin businesses can work on further adoption
@_date: 2015-08-15 23:31:45
Wow, what a relief to read this!
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:26:38
This would be nice!
I have read a message from their CEO citing the lack of support in core client for not using segwit.
I myself don't use shapeshift anymore, so I cannot check it for myself.

For their attempt "in order to use segwit you have to uninstall Bitcoin client and install btc1 client instead"!
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:37:15
Bitfinex as well((
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:39:17
Do you do understand, that _you_ and everybody else are free to use segwit? 
And at the same time NOBODY can force you to use it.
THIS is the difference in this particular scaling attempt
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:41:52
I hope it will be worth zero.nothing

It is VERY dangerous to let anybody send fully anonymous messages to just everybody! There MUST be something the government can do about it!
@_date: 2015-08-13 14:18:27

Yes, corrupt state power IS very dangerous. That's why I would prefer small government with strictly limited tasks. And prevention of physical violence would be nearly ONLY such task.

@_date: 2019-05-01 04:44:02
You really sound as if you were not around here in the summer of 2017, as a bunch of people mentioned by DesignerAccount did very well planned and executed attack on Bitcoin.
They DID troll on Reddit, claiming to control 90% of hashrate AND 80% of transactions. 
The plan was "BCash IS Bitcoin". 
That time gave me really important lesson why "tribalism" is sometime THE way to fight for decentralisation.
@_date: 2019-05-01 04:54:52
Your argument against "conspiracy theory" of miner spamming sounds like "I cannot comprehend evolution theory so it had to be the creator who did this".
Miners were THE force behind BCash attack and did get a lot of money by spamming the network.
