Yeah, about a snowball chance in hell that happens, lol.

Sure. The lesson is, no matter what kind of bullshit Roger's sockpuppets and proxies are spreading around, Bitcoin still stands strong.

So, what's the latest: will Russia finally ban Bitcoin or not?

Yep, there is no such thing as Zerocash. They probably mixed it up with Bitcoin mixers.

You do realize that the world where Bitcoin dominates is de-facto end of Fed under any possible scenario, don't you?

You're talking about ETC (Ethereum Classic) here. Ethereum (ETH) is fully centralized with just one person calling all the shots, essentially.

Bank-like services like Ripple, Stellar or Waves add very little to cryptocurrency space, and the claim that such system somehow "does decentralise the payments system" is completely ridiculous. All such system do is introduce another centralized authority like Paypal that has complete control over underlying fiat. The only difference, they just use a fancy ledger to confuse some gullible people into thinking they really have something worthwhile.

There are two components to Casascius coin valuation: face value and collectible premium. While the face value obviously increases with BTCUSD, collectible premium most definitely won't. 
Historically, collectible premium on Cas silver tens was fluctuating in $2,500-$5,000 range, depending on coin grade and collectible market conditions. This premium seems to be tied to USD and does NOT scale with BTC rate. So, paradoxically, if you think that BTC rate is going to rise, you should sell your coin for BTC sooner rather than later.
Right now, realistically you can get 7 to 9 BTC premium in addition to face value, but if bitcoin price jumps twice, you'll only get 3.5 to 4.5 BTC premium.

Yes, they totally try to downplay Bitcoin as much as possible and trump up "safe permissioned blockchain" angle. A good starting point, anyway.

Russian-themed rickrolling... nice! ;)

In fact, there are 431 total of silver tens in circulation according to  From my experience, most of them are gold-trimmed, all-silvers are quite rare. And yes, 3xface value was never ever achieved, and with BTCUSD growth the rate will most definitely decrease.

sucks for hapless 'investors' duped into buying 'The Next Great Thing' though...
@_date: 2016-05-07 03:59:13
Ha, interesting. Still, I've seen MUCH more gold-Bs than all-silvers being sold on the market. I wonder what explains this difference...
