What is the point of this? (being serious)

How does one have +3000btc and not know how to use the network? Genuine curiosity, I'm glad you're learning and asking questions
@_date: 2013-04-08 08:54:31
Wow, I would love to see this in use at an actual store someday! Hackerspaces would be perfect candidates for something like this... 
@_date: 2013-03-29 21:21:45
I was just thinking about how cool it would be to be able to send messages to bitcoin addresses! And then I realized how quickly it would probably be overcome with spam, and phishing scams.

Sounds like a BTC "debit" card is in order- that would be perfect for the average layman. But considering most of the people who have bitcoins right now are tech-types, an easy solution like this could mean wider acceptance of bitcoins in physical stores. This would at least show that bitcoin is a viable payment system able to compete and co-exist with other traditional payment forms.

Hello this is "tail girl". I absolutely LOVE my bitcoin shirt and wear it all the time! Thanks a lot and I highly recommend ordering from this guy :) 
@_date: 2013-03-28 07:08:56
It seems likely that most people who are tech savvy enough to be using bitcoin would have smartphones as well, so this isn't an unreasonable requirement at this point
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:52:57
What, giving away their money based on single comments? How about funding bitcoin related projects instead.
@_date: 2013-03-22 08:44:16
Wow, good for him! Every bitcoiner's dream right there :)
@_date: 2013-08-07 03:38:34
Haha, yeah I thought it had rejected my coin because perhaps they hadn't put very many BTC into it to begin with, as it is mostly a novelty/demonstration of concept. Very fun to use, I'm glad I got to try it! Way more convenient than how I normally buy them! 
@_date: 2013-03-28 02:05:24
I just realized-- they used Day-Quil and Ny-Quil, didn't they!
@_date: 2013-03-07 06:38:43
Fuckers. &gt;:( Good on you for seeing past that bullshit. 
@_date: 2013-03-29 23:14:42
Well, yeah, but when you are dealing specifically with a currency, that means people sending you messages KNOW you have money (as opposed to sending an email). *And it was never specified in my post that it would cost anything to send a message, although that would be a good idea.

Localbitcoins.com :) That's your best bet for fast purchasing, especially if you live in a metropolitan area

It is never too late to buy in. Don't kick yourself- think of ways that you can add to the bitcoin economy. There are so many openings just waiting for creative people to come in and fill them with solutions! 
@_date: 2013-05-07 22:58:42
YES. YES YES YES. I have been waiting for a bitcoin logo shirt in that delicious orange color!! Thank you!
@_date: 2013-08-07 03:40:12
It is a fox fur tail. And I am not a furry, it was originally purchased as an accessory to go with my purse, but I thought it looked cute on my pants too.

What are profitclicking gift cards? What are adpacks? Your post is very opaque and difficult to understand. 
@_date: 2013-03-27 23:16:33
I have been including a message about bitcoin with every vendor that I place an order with, happy to see that it is catching on! Etsy seems like the perfect place for bitcoin to take hold

I literally just sent my roommate .01BTC to play around with, and she has had almost the same experience, although not to the same degree.  She has seen my investment grow a substantial amount since I first started talking about it, and it was exciting to help her install her first wallet and explain the different options she had for using her bitcoin fraction :) (right now, mostly sitting on the coin or playing one game of SatoshiDice, haha).

Report them to the Better Business Bureau- it could save someone else from making the same mistake. 
@_date: 2013-03-07 06:35:15
What assholes! Good thing you didn't! What excuse did they give for why they would need you to send them your .dat file?
@_date: 2013-04-05 21:59:09
Oh my god, these things are awesome! Would totally buy a couple for me and my brother; love the bitcoin bag design in the middle of your pic :) Please make a post on here when the site is up and running!

If he's the CEO, does that mean Quora will accept bitcoins? I dont use the site, but I believe it requires paid subscriptions or something, IIRC

Thanks for posting this video! It is strange to see myself on film. I'm sorry the comments turned into such a sexist shitstorm however. :/ It makes me uncomfortable that my gender became such a large focus of the video instead of how cool the technology is.

Just got an email back- DefCon will be cash-only, as always, for this year at least. My email was forwarded to the founder of Def though, so we will see what happens for next time!

You might have more success asking the silk road forums, I will get the .onion address for those if you don't already have them. The people in this subreddit are pretty focused on helping bitcoin become "mainstream", which means ignoring their illicit uses and down voting posts like this.
@_date: 2013-04-13 03:07:41
Thank you so much for doing this. Thank you thank you thank you
