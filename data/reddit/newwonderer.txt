This means 0 fees to convert usd to bitcoin? Or that bitcoin transactions won't take 6 hours like I've heard 
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:16:46
So i shouldn't buy bitcoin with my extra money?

Ahh I see savings account is not a good term because it could crash and I'd be left with nothing. Basically I should call it money I don't need but it would be nice if it turned into a high amount.

How? I want to make more profit but selling it all at a high doesn't seem that smart in the long run. But I'm not a professional

Money I want for the future = savings, extra money = bitcoin?

So i shouldn't be worried that my bitcoin is down because I brought at 17k because it should go back up
