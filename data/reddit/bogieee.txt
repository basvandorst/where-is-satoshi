I gave my two best friends 0.5 btc back in 2013, when bitcoin was around 100$, so they liked it after few months when value has gone over 1000$.All of my other friends I introduced to bitcoin (~5) don't think of it as something that will last long. They see it as some kind of scam. Bitcoin is not really popular in Croatia, but I hope that will change soon.

I completely agree with you. Yes, they are both bitcoiners and I'm glad to have someone to share my opinions with. Most of my friends who don't accept bitcoin are little closed-minded, and they'll probably be sorry because of that. As time goes by bitcoin is more and more around us, and I hope everyone will have to use it someday.
