How do you figure that?  If it had zero value, you couldn't spend it, because nobody wants to exchange goods that have value with something that doesn't have value.

What kind of premium do they charge for that sort of thing?

Care to elaborate on why?
@_date: 2014-08-16 13:03:39
therefore they don't bitcoin.

Do you understand what a currency is?  A currency is a medium of exchange, that's it.  You can say 'it has all the characteristics of a product' all you like, but the fact of the matter is a whole lot of people buy/sell with it, and use it as a currency.
It's great that you are opening a bitcoin business, but just because you think it should solely be property to trade shouldn't dictate how I use it.  If you think you *should* be able to make us all use it the way you use it, maybe bitcoin isn't right for you.

Are there any mixers that you would trust?  I think sending all your money to some wallet with a promise of getting it back seems shady as hell.

Somebody said to me the other day "You'd have to be stupid NOT to invest in silver right now.  It's $17 an ounce, but it's going up to $45 an ounce in a couple of months".
Really, is that the case?  Is that why everybody is selling, and nobody is buying?

It seemed to me like you were saying bitcoin needs government regulation.
@_date: 2014-10-18 21:05:41
Wow, that is not what I thought you meant at all :P  That is very true though.  They wouldn't see it as such a big threat to their system if it wasn't such a big threat.

The licenseplate "bitcoin" next to down arrows.  Maybe it's a sign to wait, prices are going to go way way down.

Comment saying taxes are a form of violence, and you get upvoted. Suggest roads and schools be built voluntarily, get downvotes. I am so confused.

I've bought/sold through Coinbase 17 times with my Wells Fargo account.  I see crap about how awful they are, and how they fuck with people who use Coinbase, but I haven't had any issues at all with them yet.
It seems like they don't go after everybody.

It's not even the specific regulations that are an issue here. The issue is that a group of people claiming the right to force their will on people, whether they consent or not, with threats of violence if they don't comply.

You're still alive :D is pleased.  Also drunk.  Also eating nachos.  Mostly pleased.

Oh, for sure.  On a related note, whenever somebody being mugged ends up getting shot, I always wonder why they didn't just comply with the mugger.

That's right, always keep your eggs in the original carton they are grown in.  They'll stay fresh for longer that way.

Is posting about a bitcoin ATM without filling your title with hashtags allowed?

Now we just need the "to the moooooon" guy, and we can party like it's 2013ish.

The brexit was too recent to really see the effects on their economy. What we've seen so far is just knee jerk reactions based on fear.

I keep mine in a hidden drawer in my nightstand, how safe are YOUR coins?
