Lol don't feel regret. I sold 200 bitcoin last year for 80k. Worth over 2.2 million now.
Feel better?
Someone kill me.

Yup. I was an early adopter of bitcoin and the Mt.gox crash scared me of off even though I was a huge believer in the technology, my coins crashed from $1200usd to almost nothing in days. It took 3 fucking years to recover and I so stupidly sold my last 200 bitcoins for 400 bucks  pop. I had made hundreds of thousands in total profits from trading and was so happy with myself.
Now I'm fucking suicidal to think those coins are worth more than 2.2 million USD and I'm in Canada so add 30% more to that :(
I'd be retired before my 28th birthday

I thought ether had unlimited number of coins? Which is why I know it will never be a store of value like bitcoin but it is great as a currency

Same here :( feels silly to buy in now when I had hundreds of coins before and now I can't afford 10. So pissed I didn't save even a little of them

Hear you. I sold 200 for 80k last year. Worth over 2 million now :(

:( that's me. I really did believe in bitcoins but I was holding so many when GOX crashed and got emotional with my money...sold my last 200 coins in 2016 for only 400 bucks a pop.
Could be over 2 million now. Very hard not to think about

Man I sold 200 last year when they were trading at 400 bucks each and I was happy at the time
If you look through my post history, I am now suicidal
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:17:59
Me too. Made great money trading coins.
Suicidal that I didn't save any considering I had been trading since they were worth less than  3 bucks a pop..
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:51:00
No shit. That's like 1.1 million right now and probably more by the time I post this lol

Don't feel bad. I sold my last 20p last year for "only 80k" those coins are worth more than 2.2 million USD now and I am in Canada so add 30% to that
I literally get suicidal thinking about It and it just seems so stupid to buy back in at this price when I had so many before
