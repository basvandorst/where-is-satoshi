Difficulty began plateauing in [Q1 this year]( See the 9 months chart? The constant ups and downs reflect a tug of war between investment and payoff.

Sweet, I'm going to go to Japan and make digital copies of fucking EVERYTHING. These movies and games are all just ones and zeroes, right?

Please help me understand: why does support Silk Road? Doesn't bitcoin being associated with the selling of narcotics delegitimize the currency?

[So would this be accurate?](
Want to make sure I have it right. Virtual currencies are a kind of digital currency in that they exist digitally? As in in-game currencies?

I addressed this point in my follow-up comment.

It probably should, if it's about price, then... adopters purchase BTC and drive the price up.

That's an interesting point, but no - if by legitimate you mean legal, then I do think all drugs should be legal. However this is a personal stance.
Getting people to adopt Bitcoin is about societal perception, and it seems that most people would be adverse to adopting a currency so often associated with the purchase of substances such as LSD or heroin. 
I know the same argument can be said for cash, and it's true. Cash can be used to purchase drugs as well, but it's about the direct association. Cash is thought of as a medium to purchase many things, and we risk perpetuating the meme that Bitcoin is a medium for the purchase of drugs. They see Bitcoin and associate it with Silk Road rather than Dell or Microsoft. I'm not sure Silk Road is the image Bitcoin wants to associate itself with. Am I wrong?

I'm a researcher, so I'm interested in the history of this pedantry if you can provide a link for it.
