Something something past performance.
I love AMD. I bought AMD when this mining craze was starting. Somehow they fail to capitalize on this and he stock is still just muddling while Nvidia shares are just crushing it. Personally I believe their CEOs have been garbage but I'm a hodl on them because they are the company in GPUs. Xbox, PlayStation, mining. They have to tilt right?

Anorak tech - Google it
There's a few video explanations and bitcointalk.com altcoin mining has a nice step by step guide. There's even a one click tool now but you may have to try different bios settings as each card is a bit different. I started with an Asus card I bought with my amex plat (90 day purchase protection) so if it breaks I'll just get a new one but as long as you lode the right bios, usually your comp will just crash and you need to reflash to a better bios. Also, you can unbrick a card with Linux but I have been lucky sofar where I don't need to do that yet.
TLDR it's easy but first time is scary, when you see your hases go up from 21 to 25 you start getting greedy. I got a Asus Rx 580 4GB running stable dual mining 28.8 MH/s and 600h/s siacoin. 4-6$ / day at current prices

Overstock takes BTC
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:30:13
Stop being rational about this. I'm trying to have fun!
Real talk: agreed
BTC has been overvalued recently as it finds its new identity and now it's pretty mainstream. BTC is the currency of crypto. It's found a new use and it's not going to stop being that for the short term. I think the shit coins might be over now and that's good and the market will decide what actually has value. That investment in good coins will be via BTC.
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:18:38
That's the best part. It's like fantasy football. You can write a narrative in your head and it makes sense but then Sunday comes and you're fucked or your vindicated.

I think of crypto as an investment. I'd rather fail with a plan than win with no strategy because I like to think I learn from my mistakes. 
Ex: I bought Snapchat IPO. Dumb idea. Fuck ICOs. Obviously some IPOs/Icos pay off but my thought process was " I use Snapchat, so it should be good stock" but after I bought it I looked deeper and realized the product is good but not aoneh maker. Did product but not making money hand over fist the way Facebook is.

What are you saying is positive? The lack of negative? There hasn't been any hard stance taken like sombody saying "cryptos are the devil, ban them" so it's a positive hearing?
I heard a lot of trepidation and "we need to keep looking at this" 
I wouldn't expect this hearing to touch on current market price more than the idea that it's super variable, which we have heard and we all know this. So I don't take this hearing as an indication of the bottom.

You caught it from Bitcoin. Right after your first buy you feel excited and happy. 10 minutes later you we're depressed and lethargic. It's been going back and forth for weeks now

Price manipulation is why it's illegal. A company could theoretically have a large buy order to prop their own stock up. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 14:25:10
Eh on the company. My mangers actually told me to stop telling people about the volunteering thing. I didn't even know about it till 2 years ago. Been here 5 years.

Convert to BTC? 
@_date: 2018-02-27 16:15:36
Because everyone is waiting for a major exchange to announce support. Also seems to be a lot of negative sentiment about it. I'm pro BTCP but I see the negatives too:
Lots of firsts: not necessarily a good thing:
First coin to completely have every coin available.
First 2 coin merge fork to my knowledge
Major questions about unclaimed coins. Say 10% of BTC holders get their share. If another 90% have their BTC in non compliant wallets, how will these unclaimed coins work?
right now you can expect the initial amount of BTCP to be somewhere between zcl amount and half of circulating BTC. where will the remaining coins come from and how much will that affect price?
@_date: 2018-02-27 16:16:02
So you're more interested in the other 4 major privacy coins?
@_date: 2018-02-10 07:44:36
The trick is upvoting eveything because BTC DGAF about our posts
Edit: if I listened to eveything reddit said I would somehow have sold my BTC every day for the past week while also simultaneously buying more and hodling. I'd be waiting for 2,3,4,5,6k and then panic selling at 6,5. Etc. 
There's so much info every which way on here.

Banks are in everything that is money related, stocks, mortgage, savings, loans. This is the only thing they don't have a hand in...yet
Tinfoil hat on, banks are pushing BTC price down so they can buy a shit load and then sell their BTC/CRYPTO/BLOCKCHAIN ETF platinum level
If they own enough crypto, they can average out some level of growth. And they are testing how they easily they can manipulate the current market. Either way, once they get their cut, maybe they can calm the fuck down.

So, it's 2100, worldwide BTC is on par in strength they way fiat is in 2018, miners are demanding that the lost coins are added into the ecosystem as additional mining rewards as they see their businesses now have a major hardstop on the horizon. 
What if satoshi planned for the event of lost coins being like a small fund for the future dev team to be allowed to deal with as they saw fit.
This is just a theory, to say it's impossible would be naive considering were only 7 years deep in this shit and there's 120 more years of game to be played.

This a scam website or you're overcharging. Either way wrong sub

Dollar cost average if you're worried about price. If you invest $1000 dollars now you will have one entry point. You could invest $100 every couple of days. If the prices goes down you resetablish your entry point. If it goes up, you can still profit on the rise. 
@_date: 2018-02-19 13:12:26
That's one example but there's many more.

Imagine you have 100 million dollars. You want to accumulate BTC, The exact price doesn't really concern you. You just buy when it goes down and sell when it goes up by setting your bot

Tits is why I don't understand some alt coins. Why would a large, cash rich company use your crypto when they can just make their own and cut your stupid ass out of it.
Similarly, I have become much more reserved about altcoins that are tied to much to another crypto. Prl uses IOTA. Anything that runs on ETH.

I'm in your side. I think my statement was not worded well. She sucks. She stole. But she wanted to tell people she wrote it so she could say she made something. I mean, I'm not a coder, but I could throw some shit together, but that would blow some peoples minds....she would have impressed me with just throwing together a tool and giving credit, but she got greedy and the internet comes for everyone.

It's mostly about how they fucked up the bitcoincash launch/insidertrading/if you sent X dollars and they haven't responded in days posts (nobody's posing about how their cash got in successfully)
Also people had issues getting cash out because it was the end of the year and it was ath. No shit.

The .com thing is very relevant to alt coins. I read the use cases and white papers and it all sounds great but if nobody uses you payment system or desentralized app playform or bird internet, you're fucked. 
Coins I like are ones that have real use cases that fix today problems. Siacoin, it's distributed Dropbox. It's cheaper and I can mine the currency. I like that. IOTA, cool idea? IoT payment platform, far out man, machines and shit. When will this be implemented and useful.
.com had tons of great ideas but execution and consumer/business demand will weed out the good from the bad. DYOR and hopefully you pick the Google's and not the pets.com
