US Government is a Scam: Weak Fundaments / No Roadmap / weak Team / High Marketcap / Giant but not Sleeping / extremely centralized / no IOS or Android APP / jobs only by referral system
Never go FULL bitconnect davor or USgov

do you think 10k USD is enough ? I mean even if it  goes tenfold - thats not even a house.
I am thinking about 25k USD being a siceable amount to go in. Off that sum - if it goes 10x or 20x you can like really create something live changing: House + flat + decent Mercedes

How come nobody sues the shit out of Mtgox?
In my central european country it is a felony to delay an obvious bankruptcy. Punishable by up to 3 years in Prison.
Also a permanent removal or denial of property (and trying to do so) is punishable by up to 5 years in Prison.
Why is it possible that EMPTYgox (allegedly) commits such obvious violations of law without any juridictional consequence? 
@_date: 2018-05-09 11:28:38
if he did this in Europe we would have gotten 15 years tops

My tax-haven living ass couldn't care less about what a foreign government entity in the infamous Trumpistan country thinks.
virtually all governments are spreading FUD, because their scamcoin tokens (USD, EUR, YEN, JPY) are losing value.
Only adoption seems to keep these Scamcoins afloat

The Minister of Finance is a cuck.
He said the reasoning behind this intent to regulate is to preserve the prestige and public perception of the financial sector as a whole.
Can't make this shit up.

i thought about that. If satoshi moved coins to an exchange price would probably flash crash as soon as word gets out and spreads
if he moves it back off - instant pump
that would be exciting
