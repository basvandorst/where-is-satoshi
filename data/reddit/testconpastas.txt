bitcoin is not over save money ( which it does.ex gyft) its about freedom and control your own finances

I guess that in the same way that other mesh networks. 
you only need to "contact" with near nodes (no need of internet, if you use an external wallet) by wifi or BT just like opengarden.
the name coinmesh gave me a hint, but we'll have to wait till more info to be released by devs.

I think that the judge who has allowed a warrant for 88€ deserves be punished by law.
If this judge had an amazon's wish list and anybody send him a gift with a stolen CC . would be he right having a bunch of policemen in his house?  I doubt it....
@_date: 2014-12-18 16:32:03
so 300€ CC fraud is not small crime just like  300€ in a supermarket??
for me its hard to believe CC lobby has their own laws.  but i am not a lawyer neither a thief, so no idea about laws
@_date: 2014-12-18 15:17:35
which country are you from where police enter in your house for an allegedly 300€ fault?  are you telling us all the truth?
@_date: 2014-12-16 12:41:38
I have 10k and no invitation. What should i do to get one?

@_date: 2014-11-06 20:14:01
thank you Sir
@_date: 2014-12-18 15:47:18
because they need a judge warrant and no one gives one of those for a 300€ fault.
are you trolling me?

"Plugging your Trezor into the phone to have it sign transactions,,"
this Is what all trezor owners are wishing to get.
thumbs up  to warm up internal discussion...

when a mycellium server ?( electrum style). I think it should help mycellium network to spread and give more confidence avoiding centralized servers

you are guessing OP is a thief with 3 or 4 complaints ( he said he has only 2 ). what i was guessing is OP did everything legal and counterparty from purse.io is the thief. 
Still weird to me to have a police raid in your house, then all amazon "wish listers" are in danger of police  entering at home.
@_date: 2014-11-13 12:30:58
and no centralized servers. It seems like  a trading mesh net

Free market capitalism doesn't exist in any country. Just like santa, or intrinsic value.
@_date: 2014-12-18 16:07:26
thank you for your response but i dont think in europe things work that way. i cannot imagine police entering in anyone's home and a judge giving a warrant  for a lesser fault.  any EU lawyer?
@_date: 2014-12-18 22:01:05
nobody is buying anything in the street to a shady guy. you are using your real data and one guy is "giving you a gift". ( using purse.io)
i undestand your point but I can never defend actions against personal freedoms . and entering one's home is very "heavy"  one for a "probable cause"

bitID and trezor should be the perfect couple.
Still waiting websites start to use BitId to log in.

in that case I agree, but sometimes depending which country , taxes....  renting is more efficient than buying
@_date: 2015-02-19 12:10:35

You dont have to connect external nodes (servers) giving your xpub key
So more private  (secure)
@_date: 2015-02-02 10:53:23
real state cost you taxes even  if only used for saving value. storing bitcoin doesn cost anything.
@_date: 2015-02-19 12:43:31
thank you

it doesnt seem open source at all. I hope to be wrong if they want to have customers
