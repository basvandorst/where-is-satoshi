I had a convo with someone the other day. I'm an electrician that does gas stations for wawa. The sheer amount of work that goes into a gas station is tremendous. All the way from the blueprints, to the gas station getting regularly filled with gas. An electric station would be a small percentage of that. Power lines are ran everywhere in the entire world. Easy to tap to too, its safer, its cheaper. Why do we still need gas vehicles if it's obviously feasible for everyone to drive electric vehicles. Greedy oil companies?

Cool. So the blockchain is like a bank account network that everybody shares together and everyone's eyes are on It? I typed bitcoin in r/conspiracy last night. They were saying a quantum computer could hack bitcoin because it can solve so many combinations at once and will brute force it or something. You think that's true

Idk man. Bitcoin is the Mecca of all crypto. Theres all these different blockchain technologies and different ideas to utilize this wonderful idea of crypto. Buy them all. Sit back and watch them grow.

Is it a peer to peer network that miners use.

It seems like people are worried about ALT coins where I see  them as useful.

Interesting. So how are we able to own percentages of 1 bitcoin? I'm also not exactly sure how it's stored? I put 400 bucks in my coinbase a month ago so when I transfer my bitcoin to a device like the trevor, that transaction is being recorded on the blockchain which ensures that i physically hold this bitcoin. That ensures the existence of it?

I'm just curious about who is the person or persons that created this. It was one guy. And just created this platform on his computer.

So the blockchain is a website somewhat that someone created? Who is running this site?

Just curious, what would happen if USA gets hit with an eMP

Really cool. Ok so I have no idea how hacking works, but why is it really hard for someone to access your source of bitcoin from your device and transfer it to theirs. You can't replicate it because that can't be recorded on the blockchain, but what if someone got into my device and made the transaction on there.

I don't see your logic tbh. The dollar used to be backed by gold. Gold was a form of money for thousands of years. A bank can store your gold and you can make transactions with a card. Gold is intrinsic unlike crypto. Gold is not an investment, it's a store of value and a hedge against inflation. Silver coins can be used for small transactions. A global metal standard.

Why is gold a joke?

People who follow Ron Paul know exactly what Federal reserve notes are though.

Today we have far more efficient ways to transfer gold that don't even include government intervention so it would not be economically bad, especially if you relate that to all the other awful economic ventures our government takes part in. China, turkey, Germany, and Russia have recently pulled all there gold reserves to bring back home instead of overseas holding. They do not trust the the US dollar and they most definitely do not trust Bitcoin. Gold is intrinstic because you can hold it in your hands not because you can't fucking eat it. It is an object that has a set amount of mass on the Earth. Never more, never less. When the dollar loses all of its value, I'd rather have my trusted bank to store gold for me rather than dollars. Unless complete anarchy spews and its impossible for me to get ( which is personally why my gold is locked up on my property ) Also, society doesn't have to collapse for the dollar bill to collapse. This next financial disaster will cause alot of people to rethink everything, and hopefully we turn to the people that have been predicting this for so long.  The can has been kicked far enough. Lastly my friend, Bitcoin will go to zero during the collapse and has a zero percent chance of ever growing exponentially. Cash out while you can ( if you own any at all ) and buy gold or silver.

BITCOIN WILL GO TO ZERO! NO INTRINSIC VALUE! CUT YOUR LOSSES! BUY GOLD!
