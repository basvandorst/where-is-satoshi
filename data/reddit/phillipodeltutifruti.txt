What is your problem, these things need to be properly tested. LN wil be here soon, don't worry. They are testing the decentralisation first that needs to score high enough on the decentralisation test before you can spread this kind of decentral technolgy around. This is not rocket science, it's bitcoin scienve even more hard. Because there is an entire industry now worth trillions of bitcoin.

This is outrages! So many people are so scared of bitcoin that they are doing their best to destroy it. We should boycott anybody that is out trying to destroy bitcoin. When will they learn? Bitcoin is decentralised, and what is decentralised is strong and cannot be destroyed. Yes they try anyway, haha I want to see the look on there faces when they realize that Bitcoin is decentralised.

Bitcoin is different. Bitcoin has value that the othe coins have not. You can see this because of the congestion. Even though with Bitcoin you have to pay a premium fee to use the network people are willing to pay this because security is worth money. Those other networks are all centralised and at any time the owners can rip people off. With Bitcoin this is impossible because of how high the market price is + Bitcoin is the only currency ever that so far has only gone op in value. This can end poverty and that is why I have bought Bitcoin because I believe in it. And if you thing that what I just wrote is stupid then so is this picture. But it's not stupid, it is the truth!

This a million times. It's ridiculous that in 2018 we still have to go to banks to buy our fiat just so we have money to buy things with in the stores. Bitcoin will be the end of this scam because with Bitcoin there will be lot's of threes that everybody can easily climb in to and get pluck some Bitcoins.

Decentralization will change the word! In fact I good argue that it already has changed the word!

Honest question: All the payments you make directly with Bitcoin right now, are you going to go 100% with LN?  What is the average transaction amount of the things you buy with Bitcoin right now?
