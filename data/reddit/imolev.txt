As an example: Switcheo exchange - telegram group link is listed in the bottom on their official website  when you enter it you see that there is an announcements channel as well: Join our announcements channel to stay updated -&gt;  where there are no discussions, just major posts on projects’ development.

Yep, i believe that 5-10 projects equally divided or 5=70% + 5=30% of assets is a good approach. In-depth research, i personally like what NEO does and NEP-5 projects.

Wrapped BTC is there + i think it is a matter of time, check out atomic swaps, they are really superb with great liquidity! ��

Hi there. I believe that it worth investing in tech, project, if you support the vision and believe in it. There are great blockchain platforms and coins in the cryptoworld.. otherwise you shouldn’t invest. You have to understand the thing completely, in details, in my opinion..

Yeah, that’s what i would do.
