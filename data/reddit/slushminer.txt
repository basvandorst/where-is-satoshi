I was responding to Mark Friedenbach's totally exaggerated statement that BIP 101 will "destroy bitcoin's inherent freedoms".  
I was saying that there is no debate that an actual ddos attack is destructive. Is there some concept there that you don't get?
At least (unlike you) Mark said he disagreed with the attacks.

I disagree maaku7.
I think my freedoms were destroyed when Slush was attacked by DDOS and extorted to stop allowing BIP101 support.

If blocks are allowed to be bigger, I don't see why I should suddenly want to join F2Pool.  Am I being dumb?

We are told that LN is how bitcoin can scale! Does josephpoon not understand that with all the volume, LN and the hubs will "own the customer"? The customer will eventually use whatever coin LN supports / recommends / requires.

Guy_Tell I respect your opinion but mine is different. At this point Gavin is still the only engineer who has actually implemented his full BIP. The reaction to it was very loud.
You and I have different reactions to the reaction. You take the reaction at face value. I think the reaction is a lot of hot air and my personal feeling is it hides an agenda.
It sounds like you believe Blockstream has honest motives.  I guess I am more inclined to believe Gavin does.  That is just how I feel.  I didn't want to base my post on that but it does make a difference to me.

What? Doesn't the whole Lightning design work the same with a different coin? I don't see why it wouldn't.

If you mean XT, that is not really my point.
In your opinion, where did Gavin go wrong? Writing the BIP 101 code? Posting the code? Telling people he thought it was a good idea and miners should support it? These things are not ok?  Or just not ok if you are Gavin?
