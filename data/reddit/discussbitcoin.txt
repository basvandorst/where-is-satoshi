And once again, I'm going to just put this out there:  I'll make a list of all the forums including DiscussBitcoin soon, in case bitcointalk goes down again.

This is legitimate. People I know have lost BTC. Transfer your BTC out of inputs.io ASAP.

BTCTalk is run for free by a sponsored VPS.
The skin is the default "Core" theme.
Custom coding - is about the only valid point here, but those can be one-off costs.
Server and security expert - Ehh, maybe, but I don't think you should hire someone for it.
Community manager - this is **not** a forprofit. We do **not** need a community manager. :S

Interesting. It seems that a lot of those forums are either centralized and created with the idea of profit, though, or "forums" that aren't *de facto* forums. (e.g steam, twitter).

Just found this. Really strange...
Working on it, that seemingly popped up out of nowhere. SMF is very buggy.

Which is why Viceroy made that Bitcointalk 2.0 thread.
And which is why I made  - because people were dissatisfied with bitcointalk.

Oh, true. I thinking from the prospective of a blockchain.info wallet user. *facepalm*

Wait, wait wait.
Someone send the address a ton of 1 satoshi, 0 tx fee transactions.

Being an admin on the chat, I can answer that. ;)
The source code is at 
It's a chatroom where you use bitcoins. Get them for chatting, tip them, donate them, withdraw them, deposit them...

Well, although my opinion is biased, a few people have been using  (jackjack, ente, tysat, me).

Maybe BFL could take a page out of thermos' book. 
@_date: 2013-10-06 19:56:30
The idea is adequate...the way it is run is not.
So no, I don't.

It's probably related to the WhiskChat hacks, rather than inputs.io.
