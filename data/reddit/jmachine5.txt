The line will probably be busy indefinatly regardless haha. If the number of people answering the phone is anything like the number of employees at mtgox..

ur missing the point. that no one knows who satoshi is, it could be anyone. hacker, computer genius, illuminati haha. its a mystery
@_date: 2014-03-02 17:19:50
ahhahahhahah.... this sh*ts getting rediculous

And so we buy more.
@_date: 2014-03-04 03:14:45
and since we think its anti government and believe in it, even when we lose everything we still support it. First thing I did when mtgox collapsed was but another bitcoin on coinbase. and lots of people posted about huge losses but still have faith in bitcoin. people are practically being brainwashed, must be nice to be able to completely rob someone of something they think they owned, but you owned, and then they go and buy more of what they think they'll own, but youll own.

haha I thought at first he was saying it was Satoshi, not the gov. and like thought satoshi was the real name of the creator. but then I realized after making a smartass remark that he was just really saying matter of factly til satoshi was a hacker lol

they would have to pay people back very gradually, cuz if everyone got theirs back today, mtgox would have 0 coins tomorrow. although if it opened up today a lot of new people will BUY gox coins bc the price will probably fall even more. eh, who knows

What does this mean? What can be accomplished by calling that number? i feel like this website helps explain but not really seeingg what the point is..

again I have no answer? were we talking? other exchanges have failed, lost millions, been bought, and were successful again, like Full Tilt Poker. And I don't want to trade on it if it gets bought out, I want to take my bitcoins and run. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 00:06:53
can it text me if mtgox posts an update, or the site changes at all?????

copied from pastebin:
&lt;hrumph_web&gt; i want  to ask some general questions
[23:09] &lt;hrumph_web&gt; a guy whos name i forget is launching a recovery effort. he means to talk toyou
[23:10] &lt;hrumph_web&gt; his idea is to give your company to the creditors
[23:10] &lt;hrumph_web&gt; unless you got a better idea now....this is about the best situation that can come out of this
[23:16] &lt;MagicalTux&gt; you should really lookup more about what we are doing right now and announced on mtgox.com
[23:23] &lt;hrumph_web&gt; MagicalTux is is called daniel kelman...he is a lawyer...possibly one of the few lawyers not out to get you now
[23:23] &lt;hrumph_web&gt; the man i'm talking about he is in japan now
[23:23] &lt;hrumph_web&gt; he wrote this letter
[23:23] &lt;hrumph_web&gt;  
[23:28] &lt;hrumph_web&gt; we want you to go bankrupt and then we will take possession of your company possibly with some new investors thrown in if they're willing....we can't conceive of any other better outcome
[23:29] &lt;hrumph_web&gt; if you try to avoid bankruptcy now you will be dragged down again by creditors
[23:30] &lt;MagicalTux&gt; [13:23:56] &lt;hrumph_web&gt;   &lt;- he basically describes what we are doing, in slightly different (and illegal under japanese law) terms
[23:30] &lt;MagicalTux&gt; [13:29:41] &lt;hrumph_web&gt; if you try to avoid bankruptcy now you will be dragged down again by creditors &lt;- civil rehabilitation allows us to make creditors owners of the company in exchange for the debts

Poker Stars, Full Tilt Poker, and Absolute Poker/Ultimate Bet were the 3 affected by what is known as "black friday" in the poker community. Poker Stars paid back players relatively quickly so I'm not sure anyone sold any of their frozen assets on that site. For Absolute Poker, the exchange rate began at 50 cents on the dollar and plummeted quickly from there all the way down to 1 cent on the dollar. For Full Tilt, the exchange rate started higher but also eventually went as low as 1 cent on the dollar. 14 months after black friday, Poker Stars bought Full Tilt Poker and has since returned all funds owed to Full Tilt players.

and it seems I am incompetent as well. I was just throwing an idea out there. If I believed that I wouldn't have bought a bitcoin this weekend
@_date: 2014-03-02 17:08:41
I cant confirm this- I just googled -mtgox "civil rehabilitation" magicaltux- and the link to this chat came up and its such a little thing to say I couldn't think of a reason why anyone would take the time to fabricate something this small. but, its the internet. so who knows

look at the blockchain that address sends it's bitcoins too..  i just added it to my post. one has had 346,000 bitcoins recieved. this is a hell of a scam!!
