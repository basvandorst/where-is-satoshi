Thank you for the serious suggestion. I'll talk to a couple of my colleagues and see if this would be a feasible solution.

Also, anyone with PR experience that would like to join the team, PM me. As I'm sure is clear, I am a developer(as are the rest of the current team members) and my writing skills and such are not that great.

Would $1 be better? We're willing to work with the community on this.

We obviously do not have the communities trust yet, and we recognise this. Part of the reason for the low price of the initial round is in the hope that people will decide to give us a shot. We also hope that the winner would post back here and confirm that they received their winnings. 
We would like to be in this for the long haul, sure we could just take them and run but from a business perspective running a successful site sounds much better to us.

I respect that, I know there have been many shady gambling sites in the past. I would like to let it be know though that once the site is up and running we will release our source code for community review and hope to be as transparent as possible as well as following local laws and regulations. We don't want to be just another bitcoin gambling site, we want to do it correctly. Once again, we're in for the long haul not for just a quick buck.

No comment on our location until we have everything sorted out but we are doing our best to comply with all local laws and regulations in our area.

It has become clear to us that we need to do some more work on this and build some community trust. So consider this closed for now, we will return any coins sent to that address until we are ready to try again.

We need a way to truly test our system with real bitcoins running through it though. If you have an idea on how to do this in mass without people having to use their bitcoins we're all ears.
And as I said, the website isn't finished. Is there any form of proof the community would want that we could provide? I'm sure a screenshot of what we have so far for the website wouldn't be enough to satisfy(Photoshop and such)..

Yeah, we're beginning to see this isn't going to work as is. I'm going to leave this up for the 48 hours and see if anything comes of it but we're going to work hard to try and finish up the page itself (it wouldn't be hosted on the correct domain yet, we're still in talks to get the one we want but we could still have people use it)
