What I recall reading is the price you see on their charts is the lowest price on their books, but when you go to buy, the price you get is not the lowest price. Not sure why. Seems the only way to get the lowest price is via Gdax.

Some folks have instant purchase available on Coinbase app, which is nice if you want to transfer the coin you bought right away to an exchange. Though CB charges you a fee, and the price you pay always seems higher than the price they display on the app. Robinhood is nice because you have the option of placing a limit order on the app, but your can't withdraw your crypto yet. So if you were looking to just hodl BTC or ETH, and don't mind trusting them to hold your coins, not a bad option. 
For now I'd rather pay the Coinbase fee and have the option to transfer out my coins to an exchange or my wallet.

I was 793,465. Signed up Jan 27, accepted Mar 6. I did have some cash deposited into their account. Not sure if that helped.

I think most people would advise to always have some diversification. I mainly have my money in traditional investments, some that pay dividends and some that do not. Even though I believe strongly the technology behind crypto is here to stay and change the world, I'm not too sure If the coins attached to them will. If you're young and not investing much, you can afford to take more risk because you have more time to bounce back. Still I wouldn't invest 100% into crypto.

Not a monthly flat fee and only charged if you buy via Coinbase. If you use their exchange,  Gdax and place a limit order, there are no fees. Also no fees from Gdax to withdraw. Only catch is you need to have money already deposited into Coinbase/Gdax to buy on Gdax.

In order to transfer the $10 gain into your checking account, you'd have to sell BTC into fiat. Which is also a taxable gain. Plus if the price of BTC goes up to $120, you've missed out on the additional $10 gain, since you had to sell at $110.

Don't forget points that cc offers for each purchase. Only reason I use it over cash for all my purchases

My friend you have been using the wrong cards if you're only getting half a point.  Chase can offer up to 5x pts or as you say 5 pennies. But the real value is in travel rewards if you have the right card.  For example if you lived on the West Coast of the US you could fly round trip to Hawaii on 25,000 pts, which in cash value at 1 penny a point is $250. As you may knows it's almost impossible to find round trip tix to Hawaii for $250. There are way more examples and ways to quickly earn points. I won't go into details here because there are plenty of blogs that explains this. But the point is why not use the CC to collect points that you can turn into free perks?

Oh I definitely will, as long as they keep serving it.
