They replied with a statement which sounds like they will continue to state they accept bitcoin while only accepting coinbase. 
Thanks for your inquiry. We value your business and hope we can find a way to continue to service your gift card needs.  
eGifter is in the process of making some changes to how it accepts bitcoin payments. We have always used Coinbase as our bitcoin payment processor and recently updated to their latest integration, improving performance and security and for those who use Coinbase Wallet, adding convenience.  The result of the upgrade is that we are currently only offering their Wallet as a payment option. We realize this may not be right for everyone and are considering other options going forward.  
We really appreciate your feedback and take it very seriously, and apologize for the inconvenience. If you have any other specific thoughts or questions please reply with them. Hopefully we can can work through our changes quickly and wind up with a payment option that suits your needs in the near future.  We will send emails to our bitcoin customers to keep you posted on our progress.  
eGifter has always been a big supporter and important member of the bitcoin community. We plan to continue our support and ask that you bear with us during this transitional period.  
The eGifter Team!"

**Here is how the plan works:**  Users submit ideas for funding.  The site takes a 10-20% fee.  Most projects/users who do reach their funding goal will turn out to be scams/fraud.  This will generate a lot of press (negative press) which will drive traffic and crypto articles.  Select projects will be funded from the inside (Josh) and published via Press Releases and paid news articles (bribes etc.)  This will offset the negative press with positive press and drive more traffic.   
*Most people would assume that plan is scammy enough sounding on its own.   It's not.*
**The real goal.**  Users who submit projects grant an irrevocable license to their idea to GAW/Josh/CPIG meaning that group can take the idea, delete it from the site and launch it on their own!   It's basically a way to collect free Intellectual Property in order to find that next idea which will stick. 
**The proof is right in the TOS:** (Which is obviously offline ATM)


Also, WTF is database rights?

I replied again with this:  "You understand refusal to remove my personal information is a violation of your terms and my rights?    You stopped accepting bitcoin.  No one should do business with you at this point. "   
They finally replied that they would delete my account.    
Coinbase is not bitcoin.   If you accept coinbase that's fine, just don't advertise you accept bitcoin if you don't.   That's not puffery under any legal sense, that's a flat out lie.

Wait, are they saying Homero Joshua Garza is a scammer?  
The same guy who just released a pre-order for a credit card at  
The same guy who just released a way to legally own all of your ideas for only a 10% fee at  
The same guy who is allegedly fleeing from the US government in Dubai?  
The same guy with a secret project? 
Really? 
A short muggle starting with the online handle josg21 to, allegedly, ■■■■■ about boob jobs (plastic surgeons) and poor service Mr Homero Garza has since changed to the handle GAWCEO. A while later after tainting the handle GAWCEO a change was made to MrCEO and minerorigin which exist in parallel. In order to, allegedly, attempt confusion over his real name Homero Joshua Garza uses his middle name and mixes up aliases so he is commonly known as Josh Garza or Joshua Garza. On several patents held with Mr. Stuart Fraser Vice Chairman of Cantor Fitzgerald, Garza uses H. Joshua Garza as opposed to H. Josh Garza. Various internet Trolls and FUDsters refer to him as Homero Garza or Homero Josh Garza or just Mr. Scam Muggle. Mr Garza, allegedly, started his entrepreneurship with Optima Computers LLC in Brattleborough Vermont (VT) where he then branched out into the, alleged, oversubscription of Broadband service with his company Great Awk Wireless also called GAW High Speed Internet and shortened to GAW HSI. Having claimed to make millions with this service or sale of the company or something, Mr Garza then went on to the cryptocurrency industry where he, allegedly, applied the same oversubscription techniques to ASIC Mining with his platforms ZenMiner and ZenCloud selling virtual products called the Hashlet and Hashtaker. Sometimes referred to as CashLets, CashTakers and Ponsi's. Through the purported success of said platforms under a conglomerate of companies called Geniuses at Work or GAW for short Mr Garza, allegedly, moved on from GAW Miners LLC to a new company which should have provided a clean slate. Business Technology for Cryptocurrency LLC or BTC LLC for short which matches the domain name BTC.com puportedly purchased for 1.1 Million USD, was born. This company launched several platforms such as PayBase at Paybase.com and paycoin known as XPY. The PayBase platform allegedly destroyed the products PayFlash (gyft) PaySave (zincsave) as well as others. The Paycoin "Currency" allegedly destroyed the concepts of HybridFlex, FundSafe, Huh. After much public scrutiny Mr Homero Joshua Garza married to Jessica Garza then set out to not own the platforms Coinstand at coinstand.com (which used an, allegedly, embezzled codebase called zincsave to purchase from Amazon violating the ToS) and mineral at mineral.com (which used an, allegedly, embezzled codebase called coin-swap). These new ventures were purportedly related to Hong-Kong, hong kong, while rumor persists of Dubai being the real location.

They lied.  If the truth pisses them off it's not my issue.    They have a choice to stop lying.  They can change all of their published information to state they accept coinbase payments.

Coinbase is made of vinegar.   
Companies who outright lie in order to attract customers are not worthy of honey.
