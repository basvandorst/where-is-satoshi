I can pretty much tell you, that the US has nothing do to with this issue. 
Pokerstars operates in the Isle of Man jurisdiction and they are the regulators whose rules they have to obey.
I know from a fact that IOM commision has prepared a collaboration with GoCoin  to meet the KYM and AML regulation required by the banks.
This in allready in motion and not only Pokerstars but other online gambling sites operating IOM will start using Bitcoin as soon as this solution is in place.
In my eyes this puts IOM on top of Alderney and Malta as regulators, and will surely increase adoption of Bitcoin.

I have no idea why the article mentions Alderney as BTC friendly, they are caught with their pants down the same way as Malta. 
Both of them during the Bitcoin4igaming conference were just stating - we wait how this plays out and we are waiting for the operators themselves to come with an answer on "how".
I already wrote this into a similar tread. The solution for IOM based operators is a collaboration with GoCoin that the jurisdiction prepared. They stated that the payment processors/banks (who basically dictate the KYC/AML standards) are so far satisfied with the solution prepared.
However there was never any talk about the ETA. And US players will obviously be still unable to play if not using "extra" methods.

I will be attending as a content provider/developer for online casinos. We see Bitcoin as the future of payment systems in our industry.
Feel free to arrange a meeting trough a PM.

I have experience in both BTC gambling industry and the fiat one (since they are starting to slowly merge). 
The edge Bitcoin payments provides to the operators and the savings they gain from seamless payments are often passed to the players in form of higher services and mostly big rewards for VIP players or other direct marketing as giveaways.
But the online gambling sites that aim to cross mainstream with Bitcoin never think about lowering or eliminating the house edge - that straightly defeats the purpose of an online casino.
Not to mention that the casinos do not have control over the RTP since they are mostly using 3rd party providers who dictate that.
