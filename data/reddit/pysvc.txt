Thank you both for the links. It is much appreciated. I had the epiphany a little over a week ago. I thought, this seems like something the market would accept. However, in my ignorance, I knew of neither of these companies, only Gazelle. At least I now know there is a market, but I regret to say that Glyde is pretty slick whereas anything I could provide would be pretty ghetto.

It's funny you being scared of me, when in fact it's you I'm far more scared of. You are so scared of freedom you are willing to put clamps on everyone for fear of a few bad elements, which you have to live with regardless. Yes, everyone should be scared of you not me.

You should probably create some sort of Facebook fan page, or a blog, about this business idea. Make sure to take plenty of good photos of the crates/items. What is the LoZ package? I don't know if I am familiar with that one.

If you only remember one thing, remember this. In the current statist system, I cannot "unvolunteer" so to speak. A statist system will not allow me to peacefully to try my own system of living. However in a voluntaryist system (which is just anarchy with a less tarnished name), you (meaning BBBTTTCCC) would be allowed to live under a statist type of organization. So having said all that, which is more violent, my system or yours? I'm not the one with a gun to your head because I want to live free. You obviously have no idea what anarchism really is, just like most people. You hear the word anarchism and you instantly think no rules, thieving and violence. But the simple fact of the matter is we have those same issues now WITH a statist system. Those who cling to a statist belief system like yourself and won't tolerate those like me who merely want to live my life in a free and independent manner makes YOU the psychopathic control freak, not me.

I already use Fedora on my laptop. I need something for my Windows tablet.

I was one of the lucky ones I guess. My markup want very high, and as a first time purchaser, the seller took my money via western union without jumping through hurdles.

Thanks for the recommendation

I have noticed this on my own account over the last several weeks. I consistently get high double digit confirmations. I don't know what's going on.

When pollsters or scientists put together a questionnaire, they have an obligation to make the questions neutral and not inflammatory. In your "noteworthy point," you admit your bias right up front with your closing words that without government, evil will rule. Worse, you think all people are evil (except yourself?). I know you think you are trying to surround yourself with an air of wisdom, but you are really the worst kind of passive aggressive personality. You are the that to mankind. You may not want to communicate with me, but I'm communicating with you. You want to cover your ears and say "na na na I can't hear you like some 5 year old," but I'm not prepared to let you go unchallenged. The state is the biggest cause of evil in this world and you are defending it. You're a pathetic man.

I'd hate to see what your replies would be if i asked what color car I should buy. You'd end up telling me that the Israeli peace accords saved more lives.

I'd I ever got that email, the sender would have to be omniscient because no one knows my address other than a handful of newsletters who don't even know my real name.

Yes you can buy them

Yea I'm starting to lean towards them. They seem to have the stability and presence I need.

I actually think it's kind of cool. I hope it actually becomes a roaring success and you have to quit school because you're making too much money.
