There is pock.io for UK
as for EU at large, I imagine the unclear legal situation with bitcoin, lack of acceptance by banks (and in some countries like Ireland downright hostility) and more importantly crazy VAT charges of 20%+ make for a muddy situation
@_date: 2014-06-21 14:25:27
1. Hard to acquire bitcoin in most countries, and when exchanges do exist there are delays due to banking system and/or AML|KYC rules, this is slowly getting better with more atms etc
2. Price volatility, 20-30% movements in a day are alien concept in most countries, hence perceived  and/or real risk when people think about it
3. Not enough places accept it, this is rapidly changing thanks to bitpay/coinbase etc
4. Negative publicity due to Silk Road, any time you speak to anyone normal about bitcoin they usually go "ah yes drugs", this image might improve over time
5. Rabid pumping by some early adopters turned some people off, people are naturally used to thinking that if "something is too good to be true it probably is"
6. Bitcoin is very different to what people are used to with cash, banks and credit cards, with alot of new concepts, this will improve in long run, credit cards were an alien concept once upon a time.
@_date: 2014-10-05 17:30:19
Uhm the only way volatility would be reduced is if more people use bitcoin (use it day to day, not just hoard)
You can see volatility in various small countries with own currencies, and sometimes these get driven to the ground by traders.
Unfortunately tho' somehow alot of posters here have formed the opinion that increasing merchant adoption is BADtm
which is f**king stupid, the more people use bitcoin the less volatility, the more utility of the system, the more the higher prices are justified. 
I have used bitcoin for years now from when the price was 1$/btc and in that time things have improved alot and continue to improve, just sit back and look at big picture and stop obsessing over daily fluctuations. The way most people go on about bitcoin its obvious they are in it "to get rich quick" not due to curiosity or interest in the underlying revolutionary technology. In time these would get burned and drop out, in meantime i continue to use (not hoard) bitcoin daily.

Thanks, I checked webhostingtalk where I was a member for 8 years and there aint that many companies that accept bitcoin. 
I should have mentioned that I definitely want to avoid the low end of the market and VPSes, there's no profit there, instead concentrate on 2u or 4u Jumbo servers for those with large CPU, RAM, HD, or bandwidth needs, for example our current equipment for own project consists of 36x4TB drives, 128GB ram, 2x Xeons, RAID with backup and SSDs for OS on 10gbit fiber.
Thinking starting at least 300$ per month (really depends on what hardware is required), the price alone might discourage the worst elements. 
I definitely do not want to accept paypal or credit cards, the fraud risk is way too high in the hosting industry.

Using bitcoin to send/receive payments is far from cumbersome especially when compared to:
1. As a client, Typing out credit card number, expiry, cvv, completing 3dsecure with card payment, in fact for anyone who never paid using credit card online the first time is daunting just ask your parents
2. As merchant accepting credit cards involves complicated apis and handling of edge cases (Stripe to their credit do make it easier!) as well as worrying about fraud (Stripe do not support 3dsecure/verified by visa) and refunds
None of that with bitcoin, compare bitpay or blockchain.info receive api to Paypal or hell even Stripe to see how short and elegant they are
And with new protocols being added paying with bitcoin is getting easier 
The problem with bitcoin is that they are cumbersome to get since the traditional payment providers such as Banks have made it a pain the rear. And likes of Paypal completely banned it.

I used to accept credit cards using Stripe until one day after 6-7 months they said my business is to high risk (a cloudstorage service site, 7+ years in business). Thats despite very low chargeback/fraud rate due to all the time wasted weeding out suspicious orders.
None of that with bitcoin and no worry or time wasted when it comes to fraud/chargebacks
The problem with Stripe and Paypal is that once you are banned from their service thats it for all they care you should go out of business, that is way to much power to be giving these payment businesses!
Bitcoin fixes this "centralisation" problem with "decentralisation" and having an electronic equivalent of cash (but better)
Solving problem  listed in the blog post with a centralised identity/customer relations business seems like a step back not a step forward, hell look at here at what was written:
"As a result, the trust providers will be building a network of vetted merchants and gateways. To make sure only good actors are in the system, they’ll need to set and enforce rules and regulations for acceptable behavior—otherwise their brand will become less meaningful. This brings us back to a world of a few entities who get to set the rules."
You are not inventing anything new here, you are reinventing the wheel, it seems to me from the above quote that Stripe want to become the "Paypal" of the bitcoin world, be careful what you wish for since Paypal are up there as one of the most hated companies in the world.

No do not have the command line tools like they provide in a nice neat bundle, but there is a well documented api with sample codes, few scripts and applications around it, see

If you signup for a bitpay merchant account, you can send custom invoices to your customer, from where they can pay it.
So have a form on your site where customer fills in their details (name, address etc) selects what they want, then you login to your bitpay merchant account and create a "Bill" and send it to their email address, they can pay it from there
Dont waste your $210 until you have a good few sales under your belt for a custom solution.

I would highly recommend opening and playing around with a blockchain.info wallet, and then using blockchain.info to explore the blockchain which you seem to be doing already. Also setup 2FA etc to learn from day one how to secure a wallet, then move onto installing a local wallet but that could take some time download whole blockchain locally.
As such by using coinbase (great site) your are not really in control of your bitcoins, they are and you are putting trust in them not to do a "Mt Gox"
Sites like Coinbase and Bitstamp should be thought of as gateways (they are exchangers), a way for you to convert fiat to bitcoin and vice versa, leaving funds in exchanges is not recommended unless you are willing to put alot of trust in these sites. The whole point of bitcoin is being decentralised and you being in control of your coin.
@_date: 2014-06-22 10:27:46
secondmarket IMHO
if you look at the addresses used you would notice they get bunched into 25 BTC blocks, which is what secondmarket deals in

This whole "bitpay" or &lt;insert_merchant_service&gt; is evil theory going around lately as weird.
The more merchants there are and the more places bitcoin can be spend the BETTER for bitcoin ecosystem, after all yee keep insisting its a currency not an "asset". 
Bitpay allows you to set % of what to be paid in fiat vs bitcoin, there more business accept bitcoin the more each business can pay their suppliers in bitcoin
In business I would love to be able to pay for electricity, bandwidth, collocation in bitcoin for example. In private I would love to use bitcoin in restaurants, corner shops hell even petrol stations.
a "Reverse Bitpay" is an exchange! Yes we need more exchanges that wont scam their users, more ways for people to buy bitcoin, for example Zipzap or bitcoin ATMs installed in more locations
The only way the crazy bitcoin prices can be justified is not by everyone hoarding but by BITCOIN ACTUALLY BEING USED IN DAY TO DAY COMMERCE
once again this whole Bitpay is evil thread of thought going around is just wrong, and more disturbingly gives credence to the theory that bitcoin is nothing more than a pump and dump system not a replacement to outdated payment systems!
I have used bitcoin for over 2 years, if instead of spending these or converting to fiat I actually hoarded them I be rich now, but if everyone hoards then bitcoin is worth nothing.

Apparently too high risk for them (online storage), despite being in business for 7 years (longer than Stripe existed), having low chargeback rate, proper policies, contact, good support etc etc.
Anyways opened a merchant account with bank, and using them now no issues, fees are much smaller too and signed up with 3dsecure and Verified by Visa, which Stripe doesn't offer.
edit: just realised they are testing it with tarsnap who offer online storage and backup at about 100x our price (due to relying on amazon not own servers), sigh

But from my home in Ireland its no longer possible, expedia.com just says "Sorry, We weren't able to complete your booking. Please try your search again", see &gt;

@_date: 2014-06-29 19:19:59
Yep sounds like Stripe, they told us after 6 months that they do not want to work with our cloud storage site, despite less chargebacks in that time than i can count on my hand and being in business for 7+ years. This was before their closed bitcoin "beta" test. Been using bitpay since, much nicer support and lower fees and more importantly next day settlement not a week.
Hell with them they are just another middleman in a long chain for middlemen involved with credit cards ecosystem who will be come obsolete.

I am thinking something like 
I do not actually want to be handling personal document copies!
Put yourself in the shoes of a host, you are renting thousands of euro of expensive equipment that could be used to cause alot of trouble (DDOS, spam, etc etc) and of course do not want any trouble, nor would the datacenter or the upstream network providers.
I already sell €5/month hosting packages and do not require ID or anything of course since the damage that can be done is small and so is the risk. Not the same if renting a whole server for 50x that.
Main attraction for me of accepting bitcoin would be the low fees and not being held hostage by likes of paypal.
@_date: 2014-07-21 21:12:24
... to further, you write:
"The fundamental advantage a Bitcoin gateway ecosystem has over PayPal is that it’s open"
Yet you want to become a gatekeeper and selectively deny access to this open system.
The fundamental advantage of Bitcoin is that neither merchants nor endusers can not be denied the use of Bitcoin.
We have a world now where merchants can be banned from payment  networks like Paypal or Stripe (as can be seen from other posts here) with great ease often over ridiculous restrictions, which Stripe claims come from credit card networks (plausible, I do not think Stripe are evil or stupid)
We have a world where majority of the worlds population are unbanked but with the rise in mobile phone ownership and mobile networks have an opportunity to embrace the benefits of electronic payments with bitcoin

I can easily add 200-300TB of storage to the pool, since we have many 36x4TB servers, my first reaction "hey if this is true it could make us money, like miners have alot of processing power we have alot of storage space and bandwidth!"
Then I read the whitepaper I was inimpressed the whole thing feels like someone is putting together alot of buzzwords and hyping it up in order to setup a scam, and now few months later i find out they are out exchanging bitcoins for some useless tokens they invented
my questions (top of my head) were along the lines of:
1. How does the system handle redundancy, how many times is each file replicated, if split into parts like usenet binaries what happens when some or all of the file parts go missing
2. What happens if a storage node has really crappy upload bandwidth like 1kb/s making it effectively impossible for files to be downloaded, as compared to a proper storage server on 10gbit fiber connection
Basically how does bandwidth factor in, since theres 2 aspects to file storage, storage (space,redundancy,availability) and bandwidth (speed to/from, quality of the line, closeness to the client)
3. How does the whole proof of existence work? what is to stop someone from deleting the file, if the node with the file has to reply at certain time with a hash of the file what is to prevent the node from sending a fake answer
4. How are files encrypted
5. How are complaints from copyright owners dealt with, last thing a node operator would want is FBI knocking on doors for hosting kiddie porn
There were few other problems cant think of now
@_date: 2014-07-19 15:22:05
What we have so far are fancy videos, a site full of buzzwords, a  "whitepaper" that doesnt say much, unanswered questions, demo that doesnt work and people throwing bitcoins at them.
If storj does what is promised then I will personally put hundreds of terrabytes of storage towards the network.
But right now all we seem to have is not much at all to look at.
Anyways what is the purpose of this fundraiser? what are the aims that you hope to achieve?
Close to $280,000 has been raised that would buy you 25x 36*4TB drive servers with hardware raid for a total of about 2500TB of redundant storage, is that not enough space/hardware to kickstart of the project?
@_date: 2014-06-01 13:56:40

You have to realise that alot of people ended up using bitcoin either out of curiosity and/or because traditional payment systems have failed/excluded them, so there a mistrust of anyone offering centralisation as a solution to problems.
As for the future of bitcoin IMHO it will be dystopian, we more than likely would endup with State run cryptocurrencies where the state (or central banks) controls the mining/inflation rates, and where addresses will be tied by law to national identity cards in order to control welfare/taxation and kill the black market (or so it will be sold as), and the law would require the use of this currency as legal tender.

Bitcoin offers quite alot of pluses for sellers (and for that matter buyers) when compared to credits cards, sort of like how email offered quite alot of pluses over snail mail.
No you do not have to use it any more than buyers/sellers don't have to use cash over credit cards, but do despite the many downsides of credit card (fraud, chargebacks, fees, delays in settling funds)
Alot of people might not think its important but its progress in an area of technology/commerce still stuck decades behind, and thats good.

Our filestorage system has been up since 2006 (mihd.net &gt; ifile.it &gt; filecloud.io ) these sites did not exist then.
Recently had to remove the premium system altogether (existing members can renew with bitcoin of course, I was one of those early bitcoin adopters since 2011 ;) ) 
since Visa / Mastercard / Paypal have effectively banned their use on sites that allow file uploads due to fear of being sued by copyright sharks.
What I wonder is how the hell do uploaded manage to collect credit card as payment method when there is a clear ban
They must be collecting numbers and manually entering numbers into terminals in some dodgy eastern european countries which is a big nono when it comes to PCI compliance

It is hard to get bitcoins, but in the years I have been using them, it has been getting easier and easier, with Circle this week lowering the bar even further.
Dont forget a few decades before the internet was hard to use and quite daunting (lol dialup sound plays in my head) and slow actually compared to its modern counterpart. Things will improve over coming years.

This came up on google alerts, 
* Yes the site accepts Bitcoin (alongside others) for months now,
* Yes there is a steep discount since bitcoins are soo much nicer than bloody PayPal and Credit card companies where theres constant risk of fraud and chargebacks
My only wish is that more people knew of bitcoins, dealing with PayPal and other payment providers is a right pain in rear for merchants :(
The bitcoin integration is done using Mt Gox's new checkout button who in turn charge 0% commission as opposed to BitPay's 1%

I remember the email used (and have emails from them) but can not remember for the life of me the password I used. is there some password recovery form?
I do not think I had much in the account since I gave up on mtgox early
But then looking at the confirmation emails received the bitcoin price for test trades was like €9 per BTC back then lol!

That was my response, basically those guys don't have much to worry about having household names and armies of lawyers. Tho' Google is pretty hated by the "media" industry. We live in a world where large multinational corporations exist in a separate universe, governed by different rules and laws....

Can this service be used to pay for monthly server rental bills? Or is it strictly utility bills?

For even more reference (our site filecloud was operational in one name or other since 2005, yes when rapidshare.DE sprung up and starting fucking it up for all) pressure from Visa/Mastercard started right after the first megaupload site was closed. Our own merchant accounts (and Paypal) were closed in last year basically stating the payment networks want nothing to do with any site where a file might be uploaded (direct quote).
I have always wondered how the Mega managed to get away up to now...
BTW this is why I started looking at bitcoin in 2012 or so when they were worth like 3$ a pop, im still thanking Paypal for making me discover bitcoin :D and my own curiosity back then about this tech
