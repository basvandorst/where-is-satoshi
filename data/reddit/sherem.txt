yeah, going to be interesting, what I don't like is that engulfing bar on the daily chart 2 days ago. If we don't get follow through it could spell bad news

Sure, you still have the same fraction of the total pie, so it ultimately benefits those people who have invested in it at the beginning and making very difficult for new people to get their hands on it. So for new people, instead of getting "1" piece of the pie, they are only able to afford ".5" of the pie. In order to buy or get any type of BTC it either takes some serious money (as of right now) or you have to mine them, which at this point you can't do without an expensive computer. Which makes it relative to the person buying it. The value relative to *them* has decreased, just as if there money was inflated away. This is just a rough example and my thoughts late at night, so take it with a grain of salt.

True about the short term. But for the long term, one of the benefits people talk about the Bitcoin is that it can't be "inflated away" But in my view it can, while modern currency can be "printed", the BTC can be infinitely divided down to .000001 or however low it can go, which is just the same, just the opposite direction.

Glad you prefaced the second part of my statement and OPINION on why they need to drop, not my technical analysis of a formation that could potentially be taking shape. I would tell you about my years of experience, but you wouldn't care. 
If you don't think its like other markets, you probably didn't go to high school. Here's a crash course lesson. Price is a reflection of human emotion, it is very much like the stock market. Stocks, currencies, anything with a market are all man made and price simply reflects emotions as humans. 
Not to mention - as a currency bitcion still does not provide the basic function that currency was designed to do. Which is provide a store of value. If you say, well its just going up and you would have made money. It proves you are naive. It is still way to volatile for the average person to risk money in at these prices levels.

Going off of the daily chart at Mt. Gox Volume was 20k yesterday as opposed to 80k during the sell off 2 days ago. Very low volume. First red flag. 
The formation made a DOJI then a red engulfing bar followed by 3 marching soliders up. IF price holds here, we could see another drop tomorrow. Second red flag.
MACD is getting ready to turn over. If it does, big indication for more weakness. RSI is also very weak at this point. Third major red flag. 
You can look at everything I am looking at very easily.
Not my emotions friend, just reading the charts and giving warning. Once the pattern is solidified, I will take action. It already had a significant drop once and price held. The real question is, was that it? Or is there going to be follow through?

On the level 2 screens of bid and ask, there really isn't that many dollars chasing bitcoins. Looking at it right now, you have roughly 30 BTC down the next $5 supporting it. That is very light volume. Price has been making specific formations over the last few days and a Doji candlestick formation on a daily chart is bad news bears, 
@_date: 2013-12-04 06:05:00
Yeah, on a zoomed in chart it looks like it, daily chart still has me skeptical. Worried about this MACD crossing over and poor RSI.

Now Gox is restricting withdrawals to $1,000 in a 24 hour period and $10,000 a month. Sirens should be going off at that statement. Do you know what that means? Gox is probably insolvent. I had a small Swiss currency brokerage account with 5k in it and they did the same thing. Crown Forex if you to look them up. They went Belly up around 2008-9 and I lost it all, I got correspondence from Swiss lawyers about it, and I doubt I will get anything back. Crown got away with a ridiculous amount of money.

Yesterday, according to the largest exchange, mt.gox, volume was extremely low at 20k as was 2 days before that about the same. Extreme high selling volume in between at 80k. Just referencing the charts here.


IMO - This is something the community doesn't get and why bitcoin is still in its infancy and will develop and evolve over time. Bitcoin needs to act more as the definition of currency as a store of value. It is to volatile right now. If you are fresh to the market and buy 10k worth of bitcoins and it drops to be worth 5k with how volatile bitcoin is, why should the person struggling from paycheck to paycheck risk that? No matter which way you shake it, Bitcoin is still measured against USD/EUR etc... and when you purchase $5 of something and its .01 BTC and let say BTC drops, now its .02 for that same $5 purchase. Doesn't matter what denomination you buy, you still have the potential for loss, as you do with gain. 


I don't have a crystal ball and big moves take time- All though if the formation doesn't happen in 1-4 days or start breaking down it will move up again prolly hit $1500 or go sideways, if it goes up more, I still consider it over valued - I will remember to put time frames on future posts.

Could be. Trading is risky and speculative. Long term outlooks are always better, but it is hard to ignore over priced markets when they present themselves like this. Time will tell what happens.
@_date: 2013-12-03 06:40:24
Ah, got it. My bad.
@_date: 2013-04-10 07:58:54
Sure, but what's going to happen when BTC reaches $1,000? Only people with serious money will be able to afford it or existing players in the game. Already at $220ish, I feel a ton of players in developing areas, where the BTC would be most beneficial in avoiding bank transaction fees would be cut out of the loop from having to just enter the game at such a high price tag for just 1 BTC. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 04:35:31
All though we are off topic from my main post. Looks like the BTC is doing some heavy pulling back, so I suppose right on target with my trading analysis, all though very soon. 
 Your gold illustration is a great example, you have something tangible and you always have a piece of it, if you want to mine a ton of it, you can. Very, very similar to each other. Main difference is the BTC would be a paradigm shift of eliminating bank fees, etc... Which I am in favor of. 
The reason for the rub that I have with the situation, (not necessarily that the BTC can be divided, etc... I get that) is that when the BTC was issued a ton of the major players are holding onto the majority right now. A ton of people have massive holdings and are hording it (I read some where that 80% of BTC aren't traded in circulation? if that number is remotely close, that is not good). This drives up the price and makes it artificially high instead of legitimizing the BTC with transactional volume over and over again. Which might keep the price lower, but in the long run it will legitimize it and eventually the BTC will take off anyways and more people with have BTC. Just my thoughts in a nut shell

6,300% increase, I rest my case. Time to take profits. No one ever said "Damn, I only made 6,300%!"
@_date: 2013-12-04 16:37:37
Yeah, MACD still indicates upward direction, but if it crosses could mean a pull back. It hasn't yet and its soon going to be deciding time for this thing whether it continues up or starts to pull back. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 07:05:02
It wasn't much of an attempt, just chop. But there is someone trying to sell 90k worth of bitcoin right now above the ask, that should prove interesting. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 06:16:59
I am mainly comparing it to high volume sell days and buy days over the last 30 days along with how the candles are forming. With my trading experience in stocks and currencies, I got pretty good at trading. If it forms 2 more candles and breaks the previous high, it will go higher. But if it forms 2 more candles and it does not, it gives it room to test the $900 low again. Which is what I am thinking it will do over the next few days and eventually go lower.
Psychologically the price is really high and someone with deep pockets will dump it to take some profits. Anyone with a 1000 BTC is a millionaire right now, someone will want to keep that status.

My time frame is more 2-5 days, but I could be very wrong!
