Ok I understand what you are saying.
But they will need to make sure the opposite problem cannot happen i.e. a cheater tries to submit a fake older version of a transaction and grab the full BTC.

Thank you for the clarification.
I still find it weird that one can grab all the funds in the event that the other party submit an old state. Shouldn't the logic just be that the real/older state be submitted?

Is there any evidence of these attacks?

From what I'm seeing, both BTC and BCH seems to have been affected by that South Korea news in the same way.

I prefer the original description : 
"A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash"

"Time" could be tomorrow or it could be 10 years. Therein lies the problem.
Bitcoin needs to get faster and cheaper transactions within the first half of 2018 or it risk losing its lead.

The difference here is that Bitcoin got a lot of competition and things are moving very quickly.

Bitcoin might get more usability once Lightning Network becomes more popular and accessible. We can only wait and see. In the meantime, like you said, there are alternatives to Bitcoin that works well.

Don't invest in something you don't understand.
@_date: 2018-01-11 21:51:00
Some things I still don't fully understand.
- Is there an incentive to run a lightning node?
- Wouldn't LN make Bitcoin more centralize?

Here is a little tip. Buy a little bit every week or month instead of going all-in in the single buy. That way, you'll get to average your position over a period of time.

The reasoning of Bitcoin's community and developers is that Bitcoin is a stored value and not a currency used for everyday transactions.
I personally believe this to be wrong and to go against the initial proposal of the currency.
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:55:46
That would make sense. I hope someone can clarify and confirm this.

In your analogy, what is the "automobile"?

If you are unsure about investing or not, you can invest slowly over time. Buy a little bit every week/month and see where it goes.

You need to have them since Jan 22.

Does that mean that both A and B have the permission to move ALL the funds in the channel (both A's and B's Bitcoin)? Does that mean that both A and B can just grab all the balance at any given time? Could A or B take all the BTC before the timer (CLTV) expire and essentially steal all the BTC in the channel?
