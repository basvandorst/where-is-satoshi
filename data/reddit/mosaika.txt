With initial going public I gave 15%, 20% and 25% discounts for all items for those who pay with Bitcoin - there were no sales at all.
I understand this could be a good incentive when you buy a server from Dell, and the discount is substantial in nomimal amount, but when the item costs 25 USD and you save 3 bucks, probably this is not a big incentive for buyer, I mean they will buy for 25 if they like it anyway, so this discount is not really an incentive here, but rather just nice addition

Yes, sometimes very obvious things are not done properly, that's why I mentioned it here. You pay attention more to caching when it has influence on your performance. In my case the requests were sent through AJAX, but I totally missed out that it could be utilized in dishonest manner. So just wanted to share with others to pay attention, not everyone checks the logs, and basically I could not even find it...

no, this is useless, as it has nothing related to my question

yes, the other options: Paypal, CC, Bank wire, Postfinance - all are used


Yes, I didn't put the price in BTC itself on every page. Anyway, I don't think it is of value for users familiar with bitcoins to say it costs 0.0456825 BTC - you still need to do conversion to legal tender first. So, basically it stays two clicks away if you need - add to cart, and check cart.
Also if 100% of users don't know about Bitcoin, adding some redundant info for them on every page - not a good idea.


not sure, which country you are from, but we're in low price interval here and price/quality is very good, at least this is the feedback we get from absolute majority of customers


don't cost anything, will leave it anyway
