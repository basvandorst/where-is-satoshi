Please refer to Ben McGinnes direct email response to your email allegations of forging a contract. Recommended read.

Hey Bruce, this not only proves v8 exists, but that it was created on December 16, 2014 and by CZ. No one claims it was countersigned. Hope you will be more diligent even if it doesn't fit your prior narrative. We are only interested in proving Star Xu did not forge the contract as accused by Roger and seemingly accepted prematurely as fact by folks like you.

OKCoin had two occasions last month where it suffered from DDOS attacks. The more severe event occurred on July 10th, 2015, while the other occurred on July 13, 2015. Affected users from both events received awards.
We have most importantly, made significant upgrades to our platform and learned from this experience. We were the only platform who acted to award users with bitcoins among those who were similarly DDOS'ed. 
Our user base on futures skews heavily towards Chinese users and they were as disappointed and angry if not more so than our Western users. We treated all users equally, and we are doing our best to ensure this type of event is eliminated going forward as all of our users are affected by such an attack. 
Users received either the fixed award or received no award. There were no variable awards based on complaining skills. 
We hope to provide an improved service going forward.

Thanks! Good idea - we will consider.

With the spread between BTC/CNY and BTC/USD being greater than 5%, an amazing phenomenon has occurred where sending funds over the Bitcoin network means not only saving time and fees, but a Chinese user would receive an extra 5% in CNY versus receiving a traditional international wire. 
For example, right now BTC/USD is at 330 but BTC/CNY is at 350 (usd equivalent) which represents ~5.5% discount.

[OKCoin]( has had futures since September of 2014 and it's the most liquid Bitcoin market in the world.

This happened a long time ago. Glad more Chinese exchanges are offering this.

For example, an US person can put funds into a USD wallet on either Coinbase or Circle, and send USD as Bitcoin by scanning or inputting the receiver's OKLink CNY wallet Bitcoin address. The receiver would receive the funds as CNY after 6 confirmations on the Bitcoin network. The receiver would then be able to withdraw into a Chinese bank account.
Alternatively, one can start off with a Bitcoin balance on other wallets, and likewise send Bitcoin to the OKLink CNY wallet and benefit similarly. 
USD to CNY or
BTC to CNY would benefit from the 5% spread. 
Some use cases I can imagine would be for small payments such as paying a freelancer, remitting money back to family or friends, having a friend in China buy something online for you etc. 
We expect the user experience to improve in time as the Bitcoin network grows and the number of services increase so that the whole experience will seems like less of a hack.

We currently have many of the leading US institutions trading on OKCoin.com. 
At this time, US individuals are unable to use our platform for fiat deposits or withdraws. We are awaiting regulatory clarity in the US before going through the application process in all the jurisdictions and with the various regulatory bodies. 
We are excited by Bitcoin's development in the US and look forward to growing the ecosystem together with the many up and coming US based exchanges.

It is the norm of most businesses to have different pricing tiers for various types of customers. This is reflected in our current pricing which is based on volume and VIP points accumulation. 
As noted previously, at the outset of the exchange, we granted market makers low fees to help with liquidity.

Good question. Unfortunately I cannot disclose who trades on our platform. I can comment on two levels. First, we have some of the top Bitcoin companies and Investment funds trading on our exchange. Second, the feedback has been very positive. We have a large team including 80 engineers who are working to ensure our product is best suited for all users including international institutional clients.

First, thanks for being a user of OKCoin.
The difference here is that the rate you are using for USD/CNY is not the same as the one used at OKCoin. We use the rate published by the PBoC for our USD calculation of Huobi, OKCoin.cn, and BTCChina's CNY price.
On our platform Chart page, BTC Futures tab, you can see a link to the USD/CNY exchange rate we use from the [PBoC](
OKCoin futures is determined according to the mid-point of the People's Bank of China exchange rates. If the latest PBoC exchange rate is more than 0.5% above or below the current OKCoin system exchange rate, the latest PBoC exchange rate will be used for futures exchange rate calculations.
EDIT: It incorrectly said "BoC" previously in the description text but linked to the correct source from the PBoC. This is an error in our translation and it should be PBoC as linked. We have been consistent in using the PBoC rate for a long time.

Great point. 
OKCoin.cn is our Chinese exchange based in Beijing and trades in BTC/CNY and has 0 fees for spot trading, but has a higher than western standards withdraw fee of 0.4%. 
OKCoin.com is our international exchange registered in Singapore and trades in BTC/USD with a separate orderbook, servers in Hong Kong, and has spot and futures trading fees.
