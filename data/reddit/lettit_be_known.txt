I'm good with this tech. But even I don't know what a good and safe android wallet is right now... How should an average person?  
They also have no idea how to get a bitcoin... how the fuck is an average person going to exchange a dollar for it?
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:43:42
100k is the next benchmark... Bet it'll get there end of next year
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:36:38
Didn't cover donations... Early days people gave others btc, no payments exchanged, total value transferred may have been dollars at the time. No paper trail, no trail at all.
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:09:12
Always. Value= utility
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:55:27
You'd still have to find the P algorithm, which we don't have
@_date: 2018-05-27 01:01:57
When did he say this?  If early enough, that's just otherworldly genius recognition
@_date: 2019-03-03 19:58:58
Put the swirl around it, fair use
@_date: 2018-10-01 03:48:33
The smallest unit supported by the network should be the coin itself.  I get the sentiment to use the name, but it's redundant.
@_date: 2018-10-13 18:45:40
How do you remember wallet recovery info and passwords, it's crazy hard to keep things secret and safe and retrievable
@_date: 2017-08-03 16:50:18
Unless you know yourself and your game plan from the start was to the moon or bust
@_date: 2017-08-30 00:07:50
Also no metric
@_date: 2018-06-22 15:57:31
Getting blacklisted by banks would kill his primary business... That's why.
@_date: 2019-02-18 00:48:41
Yeah zero correlation should earn him all the down votes
@_date: 2019-02-07 01:18:04
Bitcoin is much more complicated. I understand it but I don't know the best and safest modern wallets, I don't know how a hardware wallet works, I don't know how cold storage works, I know my passwords are private keys but which are public keys and how do I transfer my accounts to some other wallet?  These are very basic level things and if I don't know them off the top of my head, the average person currently has no hope.
@_date: 2017-11-23 14:53:06
Why should a wallet transmit anything usable at all... That'd be a shitty wallet
@_date: 2017-11-09 02:51:43
None of them know how
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:07:15
Lol what attack... I blink and things change.  Years going strong I pay no attention.
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:55:10
1m isn't outlandish tho... A 21T market cap is possible long term.
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:20:51
Whatever, it can double upwards of 10 more times and has doubled a ton to its current position
@_date: 2017-04-08 02:18:16
Solution for right now... Plan ahead, prepay services.  
@_date: 2017-04-16 00:39:55
Hitted... Costed... Ugh
@_date: 2017-04-21 01:27:50
If they can develop a method to ban pools, they should.
@_date: 2019-01-17 18:16:17
I generally agree, but I have to imagine like with most things, the technology came first and application came second.  This person was in the world of programming and encryption chains before they wrote the white paper... It's probably 5-10 distinct technologies and communities... To hide yourself and those connections from start to finish, would be extremely difficult, and knowing your end goal at any of those points is rare.  The unheard of part is true... Almost nobody develops such technology and doesn't get found out eventually, because the dots that connect most esoteric things are so specific.
@_date: 2019-01-06 01:11:16
They don't crash instantly.  An apple becomes $10 and bitcoin becomes whatever it becomes.... It slowly switches.  Fiat won't die in your lifetime anyway.
@_date: 2019-01-17 16:07:42
You say this like it's obvious, but this is EXTREMELY rare when creating something.  Having such forethought about what it was, the applications it could have, and how that could translate into danger requiring anonymity from before you ever start... Basically unheard of.

Since operating system is the biggest differentiating factor in phones, but not in cars, they are not comparable
@_date: 2017-10-15 16:28:06
Calling bitcoiners simple people on this sub is how you get devoted everywhere
@_date: 2017-09-13 11:52:33
Vanjoki wasn't wrong
@_date: 2017-10-09 20:18:08
That... Is Zod
@_date: 2017-10-22 21:41:53
Yes.  Popular usage in commercial ventures is the primary motivator of actualized long term value.
@_date: 2017-05-13 14:07:22
That's what... 20 recipients... Maybe a couple projects total? 
@_date: 2017-05-14 06:42:56
Hoarding has no place in economies.  Either money flows or it doesn't... If it's not widely circulating, the economy will break down eventually
@_date: 2018-12-14 00:15:35
Or you stay in and the train is the only way to go and it takes you everywhere once the tracks are built.
@_date: 2017-06-14 16:52:44
The germane topic is strictly bitcoin with sha256
@_date: 2017-06-14 16:34:54
Shouldn't it be a straight hashes per dollar calc with asics coming out ahead?
@_date: 2018-12-13 01:12:00
Also the math is beautiful... It's the opposite of ugly.
@_date: 2017-06-14 16:43:55
But the end result is a hash for both... Hash attempts per second determines collision rate with a valid entry... I don't see how they aren't comparable
