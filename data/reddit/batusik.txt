If it is worth writing that piece it is worth it to do atleast a bit of research. What kind of journalism is that when you are writing innacurate and misleading information?

There will be a  "royal court economy" akin to present North Korea. On paper, yes bitcoin will create equality and prosperity and all that. In real terms, majority of the wealth and power and economy, really, will be in the 1%. In korea it is 60% of the economy that kim and his boys oversee. And bitcoin economy already is worse than the Hermit Kingdom in terms of wealth distribution.

Good question. If it was me i would make one or few commercial ads for tv and the internet. Spread them to all bitcoin related websites and youtube content producers. 
This ad will be futuristic. Involve 1 and 0's. "Military grade", CIA/NSA proven. Emphasize the amazing technology. Highlight the sheer power of the power and security of the bitcoin network. 
The currency part will the human interactions, transactions, and the varying platforms. Show the ease of use, speed and relative cost. 
30 second ads?   Needs to look high budget. 
Last few seconds the screen is black and it says "Bitcoin. Vires in Numeris." Under the orange B symbol.
@_date: 2014-12-29 00:14:02
Here is an easier idea:
Run a campaign that completly seperates the blockchain and bitcoin the currency. Emphasize that despite being related and interconnected one is not the other.
The blockchain is hack proof and protected by "military grade" robust cryptography and all that.
The currency, bitcoin, changes hands and is being used. This is where the insecurity is. The human factor comes in play with usage, storage and allowing one to be hacked and get the bitcoin stolen. The currency needs safer wallets, regulated and auditable exchanged etc.

CEOs get paid now exponentially more than regular joes. Don't know about the US, but Canadians owe on average around $40000  per head. Massive government debts. Should I continue?

You still cannot buy bitcoin in Canada instantly and without a huge markup. If you want instant you are stuck with QuickBT who charge 10% and in my experience the first time you buy it is NOT instant and took me about 24 hours.

oh god..
"I had about $300 on MtGox when the hack happened. In order to claim my account I had to estimate my balance. I estimated that it was under $200. They could have adjusted my balance to something like $217 and pocketed the difference and I never would have known. Or if they were a completely worthless company they could have pocketed the entire $300, as so many other bitcoin companies have done. MtGox has earned the trust that people have in them. Maybe their technology is substandard, but they clearly aren't going to take your money and run.
[–]sup3 6 points 1 year ago 
Yeah I sold some BTC yesterday (and as luck would have it) this morning on one of the exchanges with ACH withdrawal option. I'm not too worried about BTC dropping cause my "break even" price is sub $20 right now.
But I am worried this exchange will run off with my USD if BTC prices crash too hard (who knows if they've been laundering money under the assumption that BTC prices will keep going up and a sell off will never happen). Granted they're a registered company as a money transporter so hopefully there are enough regulations in place that this would never happen. Mt. Gox is the only company that I would trust, even without regulations in place."

People need to understand. Price go up = Success.
The price cannot stagnate at around the same level. It needs a meaningful market cap to be useful. Needs liquidity. You cant really do anything serious with a 4.2 billion market cap. Dont forget that most coins are not in active circulation, so the market cap is dramatically smaller still.
A rise in price is fundamentally the only measure of bitcoin's success.

Bitcoin   dollar cannot facilitate large transactions. It loses utility. There will be major instability as any number of coins can and will move the price.

well that escalated quickly 
@_date: 2015-01-14 02:55:17
By definition there cannot be stability. Why is it so hard to grasp??
Eli5 : if demand for bitcoin goes up = price will increase. If demand wanes = price drops. 
You can't have increasing demand without increasing price ( volatility) and vice versa.
The current market cap cannot facilitate. big transactions, meaning to be truly useful, the price has to increase. And its very unlikly it will be increasing at the same price poi t as the dollar?? ( btw the dollar is slowly depreciating no matter how strong it seems now)

I agree. Bitcoin could have infinite supply and still work fine, like freaking dogecoin. Yes it has network effect. Yes i believe it will succeed. However, at a production and value to society it doesn't have much infrastracture. 
That is not the point though. We are in the beta still.

I believe bitcoin will become the foundation for large transfers of value internationally in the most secure and trasparent manner. Anything other than that will either be a sidechain or an altcoin.

A 401(k) is a retirement savings plan sponsored by an employer. It lets workers save and invest a piece of their paycheck before taxes are taken out. Taxes aren't paid until the money is withdrawn from the account.
most people just put money away. sure they save on taxes. great. until the money is withdrawen and by that time the inflation would have destroyed your savings. 
im sure more financially savvy people can use this well to make big gains. most people just put money away, pay some sharks to manage this moeny, and possibly see some money later in life.

Unless you yourself or many people around you were there during the "annexation" you would have known better. 
Crimea was joined with Ukraine during the Soviet Union in the 50's because the landmass is connected at the south of Ukraine. Ethnically its is majority Russian and with a big, and arguably oppressed Crimean Tatar population. 
Neither of these people was very excited about the very fast and in-your-face Ukrainization of the majority Russian speaking peninsula. 
The corruption from Kiev and string-pulling by the United States and Russia of course didn't help.

Brazil’s outlook for this year is worsening. Uncertainty over the government’s ability to boost growth is rising and the Petrobras scandal is expected to weigh heavily on investment levels. LatinFocus panelists shaved off 0.5 percentage points from last month’s projection and now expect the economy to contract 0.6% in 2015. For 2016, panelists see the economy growing 1.5%.
"Russia is skating on thin ice: Cheap oil, Western sanctions and years of mismanagement have sent its economy into a deep freeze."
"India suffered its slowest phase of economic growth for a quarter century during the previous two years when it clocked consecutive growth rates of sub-5 percent. The economy is still growing far too slowly to generate enough jobs for the increasing number of people entering the labour force."
"Mainland GDP targets lowered to 6.8 per cent and 6.3 per cent for next two years, with falling property prices and ageing population to blame"
South Africa:
"According to the Medium Term Budget Policy Statement (MTBPS), economic growth was expected to rise gradually over the medium term, reaching three per cent by 2017."

* by CRASH I mean the USD gets knocked out from being the world reserve currency. It can be displaced slowly or abruptly. If world oil trade is to be traded with Yuan, Ruble, Iranian Rial or the Euro, the Dollar's dominance can be severely damaged. If bilateral trade between big economies is to be done with their currencies, like what China, Russia, Brazil and many others are working on that will be bad too. The Gulf states are thinking of a common currency already, and Russia is pushing their new "Ex-Soviet" Union idea too. 
This USD collapse from power can be accidental and engineered. 
* The SDR is a basket of currencies. Yes. But if international trade and banking is done via the SDR, which the IMF issues, than it will replace the USD, even though the USD is part of it. This is what I understand. 
* I talk about conspiracies because I was not born yesterday. The one world government and one world currencies are not new or radical ideas proposed by lunatics and tinhat psychos. You know exactly what I am talking about.

@_date: 2015-03-06 19:51:22
Again you dont get it. Dogecoin and 99% of the alts are trash. 
Bitcoin is divisible infinitly, so if uou want to dick around with ur pennies worth of dogecoin you can do EXACTLY the same with bitcoin, albeit with more infrastructure to play with. 
@_date: 2015-03-12 04:51:11
LOL well i repeated your post. 
have some bits on me 
333 bits @_date: 2015-03-16 17:18:03

It goes in great length to disprove what you just said about the gold standard. 
@_date: 2015-03-11 00:23:57
Don't you think most if not all devs hold bitcoin? If through marketing and infrastructure the price goes up then they gain.

@_date: 2015-03-06 20:28:17
Yes i would imagine operating a grey market gold exchange on craigslist might raise flags.
Since bitcoin is a currency and a commodity, when you resell it it can very well be money laundering. 
Im not dissing you, its just that if you chose to use them, u must understand..

Bitcoin is not annonymous in most cases and is fairly easy to trace if you can afford the means. Bitcoin "banks" like circle and coinbase are compliant and do plenty of kyc/aml procedures. The exchanges require verification.
Bitcoin is government's wet dream rather than a nightmare. 
@_date: 2015-03-16 02:03:00
But not at all instant the first time u do it. 
@_date: 2015-03-12 23:46:46
Agreed. Quick up means quick down... but who knows what next. 
@_date: 2015-03-01 22:00:47
Just going by the title of your link, i have to say i already disagree. Bitcoin doesn't have to be "cheaper" than traditional services.
Bitcoin offers you a CHOICE. And this availlability of the choice is the key. 
Overall it would be extremely hard to ewitch to a bitcoin economy because it is a sound money meaning deflationary. The government will never allow it to be the backbone of anything since everything is based on inflationary policies, in order to pay debts. 
@_date: 2015-03-15 16:24:33
quick bt through online banking. they charge 10% though and can take up to 24 hours for first deposit to go through..

@_date: 2015-03-21 18:51:35
Bitcoin. 
Gold can go up even 10x (unprobable).
Bitcoin can easily go more than 10x. Current market cap of 3.6B is laughably small. 36B is small. I see bitcoin going much higher than that. 
@_date: 2015-03-05 06:26:09
I think the author got it wrong. Bitcoin is not only usable using QR codes. You can send it via QR Code,manual entry of wallet public key, text message, phone number and even by radio.

Housing is a huge speculative bubble. Absolutly no reason why houses cost on average around a million dollars (In Toronto for example).
Yes - you get your rent or whatever like you said. You can just as easily borrow a million and if bitcoin rises 50% (which i think is not unreadonable) than you just profited immensly, even after your fees. 
@_date: 2015-03-05 21:29:44
No. Inflation is the brainchild of the policy makers and the ECB ( and the federal reseve's export of inflation to The world)

@_date: 2015-03-06 20:37:13
Bitcoin is money. Don't pretend its just an asset. 
And yes, selling used cars without a dealer license repeatedly ( I can speak for Ontario, Canada)  will raise red flags and might have you audited. Another thing it will do is fuck up your application if you decide to get a car dealer license because they will k ow you were "curbsiding". 
@_date: 2015-03-31 15:26:01

@_date: 2015-03-24 14:16:22
And deservingly so!
Unless you are one of the lucky early adopters, acquiring bitcoin is not easy nor cheap.
You must pay a fee to enter and leave fiat.
The bitcoin economy is just not there yet and neither are the cost savings.

You have many valid points. 
However, if a country starts buying up bitcoins in large amounts that will inevitably cause the price to rise and create a chain reaction of buying and price increase. That could be a great way to make money.

bitcoin cant solve the problem of overspending. ONLY inflation can. Inflation makes it much easier to pay off the increasingly smaller debts owed. Yes, it destroys peoples savings and purchasing power.
America can create TRILLIONS of dollars a year and have no inflation at home. Why? Because the inflation is being exported.

"Just proves that even brain dead people can write a book.

Bro. Stop being naive. When it comes to people's money the price becomes VERY important. 
You can't say with a straight face that when you lose 10, 20, 30, 40 , 80 % of your "investment" that you would not care about the price.

If you are talking about pump and dump altcoins, then yes. But often by the time they are availlable for trading on places like cryptsy, you have missed the boat.
Some have extremely low liquidity and you will not be able to cash out since thwre will be no buyers for your altcoin. 
Good example right now is Clams, the crypto used at Just Dice gambling website.
