I don't think you're understanding this correctly at all.  In order to give it to someone on the LN, they have to have a Lightning-enabled Wallet AND an open channel (to someone, not necessarily the seller).  That channel requires an on-chain transaction.
For the record, [The Lightning Network's Whitepaper]( openly admits the need for an increase to the blocksize to reach a global scale.  Here's an excerpt from it from section 10: Blocksize Increases and Consensus.


make 3 blockchain transactions per year on average, Bitcoin will be able
to support over 35 million users with 1MB blocks in ideal circumstances
(assuming 2000 transactions/MB, or 500 bytes/Tx). This is quite limited,
and an increase of the block size may be necessary to support everyone in
the world using Bitcoin. A simple increase of the block size would be a hard
fork, meaning all nodes will need to update their wallets if they wish to
participate in the network with the larger blocks.


increases in the short term, if it achieves global scale, it will necessitate a
block size increase in the long term. Creating a credible tool to help prevent
blockchain spam designed to encourage transactions to timeout becomes

Routing through a single node isn't intrinsically a bad thing.  This "central" node has no authority to affect change on the network. Suddenly going out of business doesn't invalidate the network, just that node.  If they become malicious or try to increase fees, the LN automatically routes around them.
A big "central" node will largely be a convenience, but cannot be used to attack or otherwise negatively impact the network.

The purpose of this post was projecting to near 100% adoption worldwide.  Mostly, it was spawned specifically because of the excerpt I posted earlier.  As a thought experiment, I was curious how far block size increases might need to go.  The excerpt assumed 3 transactions per year, I assumed 2 as a baseline.  I thought the numbers might be interesting to someone else, so I shared them.

They would have to be capable of determining how much Bitcoin you actually own.  There are such things as duress wallets (a smaller wallet in front of your real assets that you can give up under duress) which you can surrender if someone ever put a gun to your head.  They have no way of knowing how many wallets you keep shy of forcing the information out of you.
If a government began torturing people to extract their bitcoins, I don't think that would cause the price of Bitcoin to crash, I think it would cement the need for the separation of cash and state.
Also worth noting, they can do that with USD except they don't actually need you, they can just take it with a letter to the bank.

Being decentralized means it's impossible for a power or authority to shut it down.  This grants value because it means you can rely on the system 'always being there'.  This also grants censorship resistance, meaning a power or authority (doesn't have to be a government, could be Comcast) can't prevent you from transacting with someone you wish to.  
Because it's decentralized, you also don't have to worry about the central authority suddenly not existing anymore.  For example, if a company went out of business, suddenly it's stocks are worthless.  Similarly, if a government rapidly devalues their currency for one reason or another (usually severe financial crisis) the general population of that country doesn't suddenly find themselves without the means to purchase food (see Greece, Zimbabwe and Venezuela for recent examples).
Do you see how these aspects of a coin grant them some desirable properties?  These do not have to do with illicit activities, but serve to protect the average person from things which are out of their control.

And how do you think you load it into your lightning wallet?  Lightning channels are opened and closed with an on-chain transaction.  Once opened, they can be used an infinite number of times before being closed, provided you have sufficient funds in the channel to facilitate the transaction.  However, the initial opening and the final closing must be done as an on-chain transaction.
This is how it has been explained to me, and how the whitepaper describes it.  If you believe it functions a different way, please feel free to explain it.

Not necessarily.  Channels may want to close for one reason or another (perhaps the company you're opening a channel with is consolidating, going out of business, has done something you dislike, or whatever).  In addition, most channels have a time limit for how long they're open for (a day, a month, a year, it's up to the two people involved).
Individuals may also want to open multiple channels, or refund an existing channel by purchasing more BTC.  These all require on-chain transactions, especially if they exceed the amount of coin your channel was initially opened with.
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:35:15
You only need to ropen a new channel to route around it if you were directly connected to it, which is unlikely.
Consider the diagram in the OP and you see the "central" nodes in the middle, at least one layer away from the end user.
The way this most likely plays out is you open a channel with your place of work, or some other institution of importance to you.  This is in turn connected to the "central" nodes, which they use to buy from their suppliers, and this connects you to the rest of the world implicitly.
This has additional security benefits, as the risk of a malicious central  node is abstracted away from the end user.  Your employer, for example, incurs the risk of the central node closing their channel, while you're only at risk of your employer closing yours - something they aren't likely to do because you interact with them daily.
Keep in mind I'm offering your employer as a simple example, and this could easily represent any local business, even an entirely new industry.

Arbitration isn't a feature of Fiat currency, however.  It's a system built on top of it.  You can accomplish with something like a 2-of-3 multisig address in Bitcoin where the transaction only occurs once the buyer+seller, buyer+arbitrator or seller+arbitrator agree on the transaction - just like Fiat-based arbitration.

I agree.  Schnorr in particular is of interest to me, because it reduces all signatures to a constant size.  Once all signatures are of a constant size, we can visit the idea of reducing the block weight of signature data to 0 so that they're effectively "free" on the blockchain.  This provides additional virtual space savings above what SegWit does, without opening us up to certain attacks that doing so now would do.

I'm not sure I follow.  Let's say we can handle 2000 tx/sec, but the system is currently only utilizing 1500tx/sec.  This would mean throughput isn't an issue and the system is capable of handling demand.
The described attack here cannot exist, and cannot freeze the system, because all broadcast transactions would be included in the next block - removing them from the mempool and making rebroadcasting them useless.
The point of this attack is to prevent low-fee txs from leaving the mempool by "keeping them fresh" instead of letting them age-out of the system - thereby adding unnecessary inflation to the mempool and keeping fees high.
@_date: 2018-01-08 19:36:32
Well I probably don't require an arbiter to buy groceries, so it's not something I would expect exist on every transaction.  For larger or more important transactions, this is just like putting money or another asset into escrow.
Let's say that I was going to pay you 1 BTC for something, and we wanted an arbiter to help facilitate the transaction.
We enter a 2-of-3 multi-sig transaction with you, me and the arbiter.  Since the arbiter wants a fee, let's say of 0.05 BTC, the transaction would have 2 outputs - 1BTC to you and 0.05BTC to the arbiter (plus a possible change address for me).
This shouldn't significantly affect fees on the blockchain itself, because it all occurs as a single transaction (possibly 2, actually - one to enter the agreement and one to close it) and the fee paid to the arbiter occurs within the transaction itself - not separately.

Think of it like this.  You have a $5 bill and want to buy something for $2.00.  You can't break your $5 bill apart to spend it, so you give it to the cashier and they give you $3.00 in change.
This is exactly how Bitcoin operates.  Each Transaction Input is like your five dollar bill, it can't be split apart even though it represents a divisible amount of money.  So you have to "spend the whole thing" and receive change when you want to use it.

There is such a thing as a duress wallet, which is a wallet that contains a small amount of your total BTC.  If you're ever under duress, such as being robbed or whatever, you can surrender the contents of that wallet while keeping the rest private.
It's important for people who posess duress wallets to never indicate that they own / are using one - and that includes not entering into trades or purchases which require more than the contents of the duress wallet.  It must appear, for all intents and purposes, to be your full wallet.

I'm not convinced.  If you read around here, a lot of people have this fantasy of one million dollar bitcoins, and "experts" predict 40k Bitcoin this year.
Now, I want to say that I do believe Bitcoin has the potential to be worth that someday, but if it ever is, 1 Satoshi would be equal to one penny.  10sat/byte fees (an amazingly low fee by today's standard) would be quite expensive for today's average 500byte transaction.  That would make the tx cost around $50 to complete.
Now, this is where relative value comes in.  A $50 fee is not very much if I'm transferring around $5k, in fact that's significantly better than the 3% I'd pay using a credit card.  But it still makes on-chain transactions prohibitively expensive for low-value transactions.

@_date: 2018-01-09 19:39:08
I'm largely in agreement with you.  I do think, however, that we are discussing two slightly different things.
The attack described here is about the attacker rebroadcasting low-fee tx's to prevent them from aging out.  They are not necessarily creating new TXs.  I can use myself as a real world example of this.  In the beginning of december, I tried to move some BTC from my hot wallet to an exchange and used a custom fee for it.  Evidently, that fee was too low to be processed and the TX still has not confirmed - more than one month later.
I resolved to wait the two-ish weeks to let the transaction age-out before trying again with a higher fee - instead of attempting an RBF or some of the other wallet-clearing techniques that people claim can get you out of this situation.  Unfortunately, my TX has been used in this attack, and I've witnessed it rebroadcast several times - the most recent was January 3rd.  This has prevented the TX from aging out of the mempool and unlocking my funds.
In this instance my mistake is being used to flood the network, instead of some newly created transaction.
It should be possible to help defend against these attacks by doing something such as adding a creation date to the TX itself, so rebroadcasting it doesn't just update it's time to live in the mempool (or can at least be configured to be ignored by the recieving node).  At minimum this allows the sending wallet to automatically unlock unconfirmed transactions that are older than X time for its own keys.
While we're adding configurable settings, it should also be possible to set a minimum Value threshold to a node, so that it removes TXs below some total value (measured as TX + Fee) from its internal mempool.  This would at least require an attacker to dedicate more money to an attack - because they cannot use someone elses money (like in my case) or just spam 1sat+0fee TXs ad infinitum.

It's been less than 6 months since SegWit was made available to the general population.  Adoption takes time, you can't expect everyone to just migrate to something new overnight.  The same is true of a hard-fork - you still need people to agree that the new fork is the "one true fork" and abandon the old one.
The difference between a hard-fork and a soft-fork is that the hard-fork is mutually exclusive - you cannot transact with people who made a different decision than you.  At least with a soft-fork you can still transact with people who are ahead of or behind you in terms of migration.

@_date: 2017-12-13 14:45:04
Miners choose which tx to add into a block, they could choose at random, the oldest, the newest, the highest fees, whatever they want.  But since they're here to make money they're mostly going to choose highest fees.
You would need to design something that incentivizes lower fee tx to be included at a loss of profit.  Or remove the choice from the miners and fix the structure within Bitcoin itself.  Both of these risk making mining unprofitable and causing miners to stop.

Roughly, "shorting" refers to selling an asset or predicting a downturn in price.  For example, if I thought that BTC was going to drop to 10k in the near future, might sell what I own now and hope to buy back in at the cheaper price.
Taking a short position refers to entering in a contract or other trade with someone else (the counterparty) who believes the price will rise (they're taking the long position).

I'm happy to discuss this, though I don't think we agree on all points.
SegWit was implemented as a soft-fork (opt-in functionality, coexists with the current chain) while Bitcoin Cash was implemented as a Hard Fork (mutually exclusive, all-or-nothing change).  Your argument that SegWit has not had sufficient penetration is also applicable to Bitcoin Cash (big blocks = better scalability and lower fees) because people still need to begin accepting the hard-fork as the "one true fork" and abandon the old blockchain.  Bitcoin Cash, or any other hard-fork, has the same adoption requirements that something like SegWit does, and this is reflected in its adoption rate as well (Bitcoin Cash has next to no tx volume compared to Bitcoin - it's blocks rarely go above 1MB even though they support up to 8MB).  Just like with SegWit, a hard fork requires Vendor adoption - they must acknowledge it as the "one true coin" and abandon the other.  The big difference, is that a soft-fork such as SegWit is backwards compatible, so people who choose not to adopt it can still transact with those who do adopt it, while this is not possible with a hard-fork.
In terms of decentralization, it applies to much more than just countries and/or governments, but to any trusted party.  I rely on Banks and other institutions to store my value and personal information securely.  We've seen multiple times this year alone how that security has been breached and put people's value or identity at risk.  Decentralization helps protect against that just as much as it helps protect against Big Brother.  Central Hubs in the LN are not the same because those Hubs lack authoritative control over the network, and if one Hub goes down or engages in dishonest activity, the system just reroutes around the hub with minimal disruption (assuming LN works as advertised).  
This is an excellent video about why a Layer 2 solution (such as, but not necessarily, LN) are the best long-term approach, and why Layer 1 (on-chain) solutions have undesirable trade-offs.  
I recognize that this post has somewhat derailed into a discussion on scalability, but at the heart of this, I believe this is what we are trying to wrap our heads around.  Bitcoin promised a lot of things to a lot of people (mostly instant, low-fee tx) and it's true that it's not there yet.  Most cryptocurrencies are not, even the ones that claim they are.  In terms of technical development, Bitcoin, and indeed Blockchain Tech in general, is still very much in its infancy.  If this were a video game, it would be barely ready for it's Technical Alpha / Early Access stage.  However, media hype and word of mouth has put it in the hands of many more people than it was ready for.  Just because that happened does not mean we take shortcuts.  We are trying to change the way the world views value, and that must be done gradually - even if there are bumps along the road.

You're ignoring relative value.  If I own a house whose value drops 2% every year, this is not a problem if the value of the house I'm trying to buy also dropped by 2% every year.  They will still be worth the same relative to each other, making the transfer of value (selling one house to purchase another) just about as painless as it is today.

Probably, but the number isn't important. The point of the study was that happiness was more related to other factors.  When you don't have enough money to be alive or pay bills, the stress of that makes you unhappy.  Once you earn some more, those stresses are relieved and happiness increases.  That plataeus at some point where you have enough money to be alive, pay bills, and afford to do some activities of personal interest, and after that additional money doesn't have a measurable influence on happiness because it is no longer a means to relieve certain stresses.

Yes and no.  These hubs in the LN do not have any authoritative control over anything, and if they go down it's inconvenient but you can just route around them.
Convenience will cause us to gravitate towards some large hubs (e.g. Visa-LN) because it's easier for us to just connect to one or two well-connected hubs that are always online than set up many short-lived channels with smaller hubs.  This should also result in lower fees as each "middle-man" in a LN tx can take a small fee.
However, if one of these hubs becomes a bad actor, is hacked or is otherwise compromised, your BTC is not at risk, nor is your personal identity or sensitive information.  Likewise, these hubs do not act as a single-point-of-failure (you can just route around them, or choose not to use them altogether) and they do not have any authority (i.e. they can not change the consensus rules or something similarly detrimental), meaning they exert no control over the network.  Instead, they simply provide a service to users by providing a convenient hub with low fees for LN users to connect to and transact through.

There is a limit to the number of text that can be included in a block.  You can't guarantee inclusion in a block because there might be thousands of other tx paying equal or higher fees than you.  The same would be true with a pricing tier.
Transaction fees are us bidding on the limited space of blocks.

It's going to be more like moving money from your savings account to your checking account and then being able to use your debit card at merchants.  Once you've opened a channel with a hub you can spend at anyone connected (or transitively connected) to them.  That's basically exactly how a prepaid Visa card works, so it shouldn't be difficult for people to grok.
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:36:21
Why does this upset you?
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:34:40
Let me take a crack at answering some of these.
1) Yes, it does require vendor support.  It's not just a switch than can be flipped, there will be a transitory rollout period.
2) It does so the same way we use SegWit tx today.  Opening and closing a channel on the LN is a transaction on the blockchain.  The idea is that instead of an individual making 50 tx over a month then instead make just 2 tx (opening and closing) and then their 50 tx happen on LN (off chain) instead of directly on the blockchain.
The idea of making things like SegWit and LN "optional" is to enable a transitory rollout, and not force full adoption all in the same instant (hard-fork).  These technologies offer incentives (lower fees, better features) that encourage use and the network relies on Game Theory (people act in their own best interests) to encourage adoption.
Bitcoin is decentralized, and part of being decentralized means there is not (and should not) be some controlling authority which says "you must do this in this specific way."  That is ultimately a good thing, but it does increase short-term friction.

I don't have the correct insights to answer this question, but I recall a post on this sub about a week or two ago that explained it quite well.  If I find it I will try to link it to you.

One of the hardest parts about this is what do you do with addresses?  It's basically impoaaible to show someone a hash as part of a super simple UI because the hash only makes sense to an informed or advanced user.
Getting the community to sign off on a wallet that hides all the technical stuff, even an open source one, will be tough.  And if your local "Bitcoin guy" says not to trust that wallet, you won't be downloading it as a new user, and there goes mainstream adoption of that app.

It depends on "how true" so to speak.  Let's say BTC is currently worth $100.  If I think it's going to go up in price, I would buy some BTC and hold on to it for a while.  If BTC goes up in price, say to $110, I could sell the BTC for more than I paid for it and realize a profit.  On Wall Street, this is called a long position.
Shorting something is the opposite.  If I thought that BTC was overpriced at $100, and expected it to go down, I could short it.  When you short something, the exchange borrows it from someone else and then you sell the borrowed BTC.  If the price dips from $100 to $90, you can buy the borrowed BTC back from the market for less than what you sold it for, again realizing a profit.
Now, if you short something and the price goes up, because you borrowed it for someone else the exchange can call your tab (liquidate you) and force you to buy back at a higher price so they can give the borrowed BTC back to it's rightful owner.

ASIC resistance is actively bad for proof of work systems.  Since it's impossible to be ASIC-immune, making it harder for someone to develop an ASIC grants a massive advantage to the first company which does so successfully, and who is able to patent the technology.  They then have an unfair advantage over all other miners.
CPU mining is far worse than ASIC mining, both in terms of security (what happens when someone just buys an entire data center for mining?) And in terms of energy efficiency (ASIC provides far more hash/watt than a CPU would).

Each Bitcoin Node connects with some number of other nodes, by default 8.  When a node receives (or successfully mines) a new block, it first validates it and if it is valid then it tells the other nodes it's connected to about it.  Those nodes then go through the same process and after a bunch of iterations of this, the whole network learns about the block.
BCH would have worse propagation times than BTC because a larger block takes more time to validate (slightly) AND more time to upload to / download from other nodes.
Propagation time is important because the longer a block takes to become known by the whole network, the greater the chance of it being orphaned becomes.  Similarly, the longer a miner takes to learn about a new block, the more time they waste on "useless" blocks, and therefore the less profitable the miner is.

It is possible.  But you need to physically have the wallet on you when you want to spend with it.
Think of it like this.  Your hardware wallet is your savings account, spending from it requires an extra step or two compared to your debit card.  However this hardware wallet is not connected to the internet, so it's never at risk of being hacked unless seone has physical access to the device, e.g. they broke into your home and stole it.
Your mobile wallet is like your checking or debit card.  It's super easy to use, but you shouldn't store all your money in it, since it's on a connected device, it can be hacked, you can lose your phone, etc.

Exchanges like Coinbase are required to collect that sort of information for KYC (know your customer) and AML (anti money laundering) regulations.
Coinbase is a good starting point for purchasing your first crypto currency because they're easy to use, but make sure to understand my next point.
Custodial wallets, which is to say a service (like Coinbase) that holds your Bitcoin "for you" is very convenient to use because you don't have to worry about losing your wallet, forgetting a password, or any such nonsense.  Plus, you can usually access them directly in a browser.  *But there is a danger!* Since these services have control of your private keys, you don't technically own the Bitcoin, you're trusting them to give it to you when you ask for it.  If Coinbase announced it was going out of business tomorrow, were hacked, or any number of other catastrophes happened, you lose the Bitcoin you had stored with them for good.  Look up MtGox to read up on how this happened in the past.
The best thing you can do is purchase your crypto through an exchange, or another service like localbitcoins, and transfer it to a wallet you've set up on your own PC or phone.  I'd recommend Electrum for PC and Samourai for Android.  I don't have iOS, but I think the most popular one for them is Green wallet, or something along those lines.

Before you invest your money you need to understand what you are looking for it to accomplish.  I can not answer this for you so I'm not even going to try to.
So when specifically talking about crypto, you need to ask yourself a few things about whatever alt coin you're potentially invested in.  The first is what does that coin offer that BTC doesn't, in terms of features or tech.  Second, of those differentiators, which ones is it possible for BTC to just adopt?  Now that you have a list of features that are specific to that altcoin, which are reasonably difficult if not impossible for BTC to just add in via an upgrade, you can make a judgement call about if that coin has merit.
Once you've identified such a coin, you have to ask yourself if it legitimately had the chance to achieve the kind of network effect that BTC has achieved without failing due to one factor or another.
If it fails to do any of this, then the odds of it breaking out exponentially are quite small, and you have to ask yourself why you're putting money into such an investment vehicle.  So far, maybe four or five altcoins have achieved this, and two of them are BTC forks.

And that's why it's important that mining be decentralized.  If 90 percent of miners (measured by hashing power) moved from BTC to some competing coin, that coin is automatically better because transactions will be confirmed sometime in this lifetime.
If that 90 percent was just one or two actors, and not the sum of thousands of individuals, it's completely subject to their whims.
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:00:44
And that's my issue with the LN.  It basically mandates some centralized services to be widely usable because the VAST majority of financial transactions are one-time transactions.
A coffee shop isn't gonna sell you 100 coffees before calling collect and closing the channel with you.  They need that money today to buy supplies, pay workers, etc.  Poorer users, or those living paycheck-to-patcheck, will be unable to use it as a prepaid credit card because they can't afford to pre-pay for anything.  Tieing up a bunch of money in a LN Channel requires planning or the ability to do without that money for the life of the channel.

The reality is you are.  When buying (and holding, not spending at the store) Bitcoin, you're expecting it to pan out into a multinational currency.

I was doing some reading already and understand the "not your key, not your Bitcoin" argument for why holding bitcoins on an exchange is potentially unsafe.  I was downloading and updating Bitcoin Core overnight so I can at least transfer what I do have out of the Exchange until I set up a better wallet long term.
I was mostly asking why Coinbase was shitty to see if it was a shitty exchange, and you should use a different exchange for the types of things exchanges are useful for, or "Coinbase is shitty because it is an exchange, and you should store your Bitcoin in a safer location than an exchange"
It seems to be the latter.

In some ways, that could be a good thing.  Fewer tx in the system gives developers more time to iron out the known issues with less risk of negative PR (for BTC) from attacks like the one we're seeing right now.

The limit is also for your protection.  If your account is compromised, and the attacker is capable of fully emptying out the account, you can be screwed.  However if they're forced to do it over time they're less likely to get away with it unnoticed, like how Coinbase required the additional verification once he started Max withdrawing every day (behavior uncharacteristic of his account).

Bitcoin is currently a commodity advertising itself as a currency.  It's much closer to "digital gold" than it is to "digital money" in it's current form.  It will only begin to truly approximate currency once the Layer 2 stuff such as the Lightning Network come online.
Once that happens you could argue that Layer 2 is the currency and the block chain itself is the commodity backing the currency, similar to how gold used to back the USD.

I think his/her point is that there is an implicit trust in Bitcoin that is rarely discussed.  General advice tells people get get Bitcoin Core, and that Core has the best devs, but most people aren't technical enough to actually participate in the discussion (or contribute to) around specific code changes.  This requires that they implicitly trust the developers who do contribute to the project AND that the changelog is accurate when they download a new update to Bitcoin Core (or whatever wallet / node they are using).
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:08:48
But how is that hub not encouraging centralization?  I feel like I'm missing something obvious.
As far as I understand, you need to close out a channel before you can respend those funds right?  E.g. if you and I open a channel and you send me one BTC, do I need to close that channel before I can then send that BTC or parts of that BTC, to someone else?  If not, why would anyone close a channel and incur fees for going onchain instead of just leaving it all 'floating' in the LN?

In other words, it shouldn't be possible to add several thousand TH/s to the system a few blocks before the difficulty adjustment and cause a large spike in difficulty.

Sure there can be some Central hub (or hubs) between you and I in that example.  But that still doesn't explain how the blockchain actually interacts with this.
From what I can tell, you upload your BTC balance to the LN once and open a channel with one of these hubs, you can then send and receive payments indefinitely through the LN without ever touching the blockchain again.  You can reuse funds you received so there is no reason to close your channel unless the hub you are connected to dies (rare) or someone attempts something malicious (unpredictable)

1) If we're all connected to these hubs instead of directly p2p, don't these hubs encourage centralization of themselves?  For example, if I want to pay you, it's much better if both of us are connected to the same hub instead of different, but still connected hubs.
I've seen mention that different 'nodes' (for lack of a better term) on the LN may be able to extract fees for their participation.  That means if Person A wants to pay Person B, you want to go through as few people as possible, like so:




Compared to:




The above works best the more people are connected directly to H, because that makes it more likely you have to go through fewer nodes on the network to complete a payment.
So far nobody in this thread has refuted this, and I fail to see how this is not some form of centralization.
2) Why does the blockchain even need to be a thing in a LN-enabled world?  If I can send coins to you, you can send coins to Starbucks, Starbucks can pay their employee, and that employee can then spend those in my store, all directly on the LN (through one or more hubs, or directly, makes no difference) all without ever needing to close a channel and hit the blockchain, then *what the fuck is the blockchain doing in all of this?*  Why would someone ever incur the cost of "cashing out" to the blockchain from the LN?

If you view Bitcoin as a currency, or rather see the potential for it to one day be a currency used in day to day shopping, then seeing it's market cap match some of the GDPs of the largest countries in the world makes sense, because it needs to be worth that much to allow everyone to actually have some fraction of it to spend day to day.

Presumably the price is rising now because more people are becoming more aware of Bitcoins value.  Given the sheer number of new accounts on Coinbase, the fact that Bitcoin recently shook off a massive attack in just a few days, and simple hype, it's not really a mystery why the price has risen.
The reverse is also true. Then the price drops after a recent rise, that doesn't really require an explanation, people just sold to lock in their profits, like the normal behavior of literally every other commodity on the planet.

Until we actually have a transactional layer and can truly spend BTC like currency, it's digital gold, not digital dollars.  Just look at the posts on this sub, most are concerned with price and getting rich af, not the tech.
People buy gold to sell it at a higher price.  Being deflationary, BTC encourages you to hold it as long as possible, because it's value increases over time relative to the things you can purchase with it, whereas the value of the USD decreases over time.  This makes it an excellent investment vehicle, or store of value.  However, lacking a proper transactional layer (e.g. Lightning Network) prevents it from seeing true use as a currency.

I probably don't fully understand it, I've only watched the LN video that was posted here last week and had a few discussions in this sub about it.
The biggest part I don't understand, is why everyone seems so convinced that a grocery store isn't going to want to close a channel out ASAP instead of waiting a month to collect the money when you go there to buy milk.  As far as I understand it, the LN doesn't do much, if anything, for one-time or singular payments (i.e. I send you money exactly once, not a series of transactions). However, that's how the majority of transactions are conducted in the real world today, even if I visit the same coffee shop every morning, the payments are still processed individually (i.e. money flows from me to them each time I buy, not all at once at the end of the month).
If someone could clarify that for me that would be great, because I've never seen someone actually explain *why* a business would want to.

To make it even more hilariously naive, the government can only ban the address within their jurisdiction.  So the evildoer broadcasts the txn to some node in another country, then some miner on a different continent adds it to the blockchain the next time they mine a block successfully.

Even so, what do you track?  You cant mark a bitcoin like you can mark a bill.  They use an address once to receive an illegal payment, then use that address to make a legitimate purchase.  It's possible for them to do that in such a way that they get multiple change addresses back with the same value as the real payment.  How do you tell the difference between them?
You can't just mark all the money as dirty, because then they can just make their transaction through some batching service.   Now a single bad txn mixes with 50 good ones And the output is totally mangled.

You raise a lot of good points.  But I would like to attempt to counter them.  BTC competes with USD not Visa, despite what everyone seems to think.  None of the situations you described are intrinsic to the USD, or any other first based currency.  They're layers built on top of the underlying currency.
Nothing in BTC prevents me from loaning you some BTC, or paying someone on your behalf and acting as an intermediary for transactions.  It's not required for the system to work, but the system does not prevent it either.  The big difference is I cant invent BTC out of thin air to accomplish this.
You can also solve a lot of the "seller didn't deliver or cooperate" issues with Multi-sig transactions directly on chain, without necessitating a third party, or even including a third party, while still remaining trustless.
@_date: 2018-03-28 03:46:59
It sets a precedent, though.  If I can pay you for something in BTC, I dont care if you immediately convert it into something else, just like I don't care if I pay you in USD and you iediately convert it into Euros.  From my perspective I still paid in the currency of my choosing.
The more points in the line that accept this payment method, even if they are immediately "cashing out", increases adoption AND helps stabilize the price.
@_date: 2018-03-19 23:21:15
You accept a "zero confirmation" transaction, which is instantaneous.  It only takes minutes to hours for you to "receive" it, which is still much faster than traditional methods.
It's technically possible, though somewhat difficult, for someone to try and scam you by attempting to doublespend the money, preventing you from ever receiving it, but that's no different than someone declining a charge on their credit card.

Doubtful, or at least it can't be a full conspiracy.  The attacker still needed to gain access to a public repo not owned by Bitpay to pull this off.  This is likely an instance of BitPay being incompetent (not following industry standard practices such as locking down third party versions) combined with someone else seeing that and crafting a clever plan to take advantage of it.

While that article is a well written piece, it fails to comment on a specific point.  With a commodity-currency, people tend to hoard the commodity during times of uncertainty because they are afraid.  Often, they are afraid they might lose their job or don't know where their next meal is coming from.
As the article states, this behavior limits commerce because people aren't spending as much and risks exacerbating the downturn.
What it doesn't state is that the Fiat model addresses this by threatening to devalue a currency until people spend enough of it.  So, in the times of uncertainty, when people don't know if they're going to lose their job, Fiat tells them to go spend their money, because it will be worth less tomorrow - and it will be worth less tomorrow because they're gonna make a shitload more of it to compensate.  So you're encouraged to take risks (diminish your savings) precisely at the time when you're least tolerant to risk-taking.

First, the fees haven't been that high, basically at any point this year.  I paid less than a nickel in fees for a purchase I made last week.  So it is very much capable of being useful for small transactions.
Secondly, yes most transactions you'd see with a business would involve you scanning a QR code or using an NFC reader, which loads the public key (that complex code you mentioned) and the price, as well as a memo, directly into your wallet.  This completely removes the chance for error and takes about as much time as a credit card chip reader.

It really depends on the comparisons you're trying to draw, I think.  A gambling addict only "feels alive" in the rush of a big win or the wake of a great loss.  It's their method of achieving those extreme highs and lows.

Your credit card payment is approved very quickly, true, but the payment is not actually delivered to the merchant instantly.
Secondly, my credit card doesn't have a pin, and none of the cards I've ever owned have had one except my debit card.  When asked to enter information, it always asks for my zip code, which is readily available to anyone who Google's the name on the front of the card.
In fact, the push notifications my credit provider sends me every time my card is used have a button right on them (technically, if I click the notification to open the app) to dispute the transaction.  These push notifications come to me so rapidly, I could begin disputing the transaction before the merchant hands me the receipt.
All this is to say my personal experiences strongly disagree with with your assertions.

Yes and no.  Doing so now will mean lower fees when you do decide to sell in the future, which is probably when you care most about the money.
However that does mean you're "wasting a fee" now by making a "useless" transaction by paying yourself.  So if you're making this transaction now you're not only betting that the fees will be higher in the future (fees are quite low right now) but also that they will be high enough that the discount you receive by being a SegWit transaction outweighs what you paid today.

Here is why:
Let's say the government successfully implements a blacklist and all US-based companies comply with it.  You, as a blacklisted individual, don't care.  To continue to transact, you simply need to broadcast your transaction outside of the US somehow (such as through a VPN, or one of a million other ways, including encoding the txn as emojiis and sending them to your friend over Skype where they broadcast it for you).  Once you do that, which takes maybe 2 minutes of additional effort beyond not being blacklisted, it's now capable of being picked up by any miner or service not in US borders, and therefore not limited by their blacklist.

As you said, the OP was about Bitcoin vs. Visa, but the fact is Bitcoin isn't truly competing against Visa (that would be Layer 1 crypto vs. Layer 2 or 3 services).  I attempted to demonstrate why that wasn't really a valid comparison by offering examples of how Bitcoin is more directly in competition with USD, and that similar (or as you say, even identical) institutions can be build on top of either of them.

No it doesn't.  Literally none of those things are intrinsic properties to cash, they're all layers built on top of cash.
Bitcoin does need those layers built on top of it, yes, and LN is going a long way towards that.  But to require that L2 and L3 services of one currency system be present in L1 of another is foolish.
Hell, arguably cash is (or was) a layer built on top of a commodity, and if you take that interpretation, Bitcoin compares to the commodity then and your argument seems even more absurd.

And the exact same thing is true for gold.  There is only so much gold available on the planet, nobody can decide to increase that amount just like nobody can decide that there should be 42 million bitcoins.  Gold will become more difficult to mine as it becomes scarcer and the "new supply" will decrease accordingly.

The last bear market ran for years, if you're getting discouraged now, you should probably choose a different investment vehicle or reevaluate why you purchased Bitcoin in the first place.

@_date: 2018-03-30 16:07:20
I'm not going to address all of the points you raised up, because I don't have the time to do so properly at the moment, but I would like to touch on a few of the points.
1) Your initial set up with an exchange is analogous to the set-up you did when you first applied to your credit card.  It's "unfair" to attribute that start-up cost to "bitcoin as a whole" but ignore it when you used the credit card.
2) You do not have to wait for multiple confirmations before a vendor will give you your purchase.  Like credit cards, BTC txns are "near instant" for the spender, but take a moment for the seller - i.e. when you use your credit card, Visa doesn't instantaneously add the money into the coffers of the seller, they're made available at a later date.  In addition, Lightning Network goes a long way towards making this exchange truly instantaneous between buyer and seller, but without the need of the middleman.
3) With Visa, the merchant pays the 2-3% fee, and frequently that is built into the price of the item you're purchasing.  With Bitcoin, the buyer sees that fee explicitly, but it's often just a couple of cents (I paid a nickel on a $100 purchase, far less than 2%).  Because of this, a hypothetical world where Bitcoin was the primary currency *should* see a small reduction in the prices of items because the total fee is measurably smaller.
4) Africa doesn't care about the USD exchange rate.  1 BTC = 1 BTC regardless of how the 1 BTC = X USD equation fluctuates.  The people you read about in Africa are operating in that "hypothetical world 
 where Bitcoin is the primary currency" I just alluded to.  Because they never interact with a BTC/USD exchange, it's irrelevant to them.  Another way to convey this point would be to consider what happens when the USD loses or gains value relative to the Euro - you don't suddenly start seeing rising or falling prices in a USD-based store due to that.  The same would be true in an environment with BTC-based stores.
5) I fully admit that BTC still has a long way to grow before it's "first-world ready." There are a lot of things which still need to be worked on (ease of use being a big one), you need to understand a very important point.  None of those services you are accustomed to are intrinsically part of the USD.  If you live on the East Coast, try buying something from California using only cash (paper money).  You'd have to mail it to them, trust that they received it and were honest about it, etc.  Visa, Venmo, Loans, Credit Card Perks, and all the other stuff that's "missing from Bitcoin" are all actually built "on top of" the dollar, and are not fundamentally part of the dollar itself.  We're still building these things, but there is nothing about Bitcoin that would prevent them from becoming a reality.
6) Living in the US, you and I are lucky that we have a relatively stable government and economy.  This may not always be true.  Venezuela, Zimbabwe, Greece, and others may seem like "they'd never happen here" but if you go back in time a few years, you'd hear the same sentiment in each of those countries.  In fact, every government in the history of mankind has collapsed at some point - so there is no reason to believe that the ones which exist today will exist forever.  This might sound a tad fearmongerish, and to a certain degree it is, but I'm including it just to help illustrate the point.
7) The world is becoming increasingly globalized.  International trade, mobility, and indeed everything is only increasing as time and technology improves.  In that world, it doesn't make sense to have a currency which is only valid in specific regions, or which can be manipulated by a small set of actors.  The world needs a global currency if it wants to transacts globally.  And it wants to transact globally.  It doesn't make sense for that currency to be backed by a single government, or perhaps even any governmental body at all.  Will that global currency be Bitcoin?  Who knows.  But it's the best candidate we have right now.

@_date: 2018-03-27 13:54:20
That's not true at all in the example I was trying to illustrate.  Consider the following:
You and I have a channel open with each other.  You lose all tx history in some hardware failure or other catastrophe.  You ask me what the current state of the channel is and I lie to you.
This is not me lying to you by attempting to close the channel with old data, this is just me saying the sky is green.  Therefore, the penalty system does not apply, because I have not actually tried to commit false state to the blockchain yet.
If you accept my lie, you may then attempt to sign a transaction over to me the next time we do something, based on the false data I provided to you.  If this favors me, I can accept it as the new form of truth and now we both have signed transactions confirming the new, fraud-state.
If you do not take this bait, I've lost nothing, because I can still close the channel with the authentic state.

You can't cancel a transaction once it's in the mempool.  You could ATTEMPT to submit a different transaction using the same inputs as a higher fee, but MOST nodes won't propagate it, so you'd need to communicate closely with one or more miners, then that miner (or miners, or pool) would need to be the one which successfully finds the next block, and that block would need to be accepted by the network.
Edit:  In fact, if you think it's so easy to cancel a transaction that's in the mempool before it's added to a block, I encourage you to send $5 to this address and then attempt to cancel and/or double spend it.  3JyxK7MxdKRWMfUSoAPfRGvWdZYJGvnhoY

@_date: 2018-04-13 21:32:54
There are two main ways a txn can fail.
The first is that you try to send more than the network can "afford".  This means the nodes enroute to the payee have less money than you want to send.
The second is that the network cannot find a route from the payer to the payee.
Both of these are solved by having a larger network.  By definition, a larger network will have more connected nodes, meaning more possible routes for a payment to take and more total money available to send in a single payment.
@_date: 2018-04-10 18:51:02

Doing certain things could change the transaction Id of a transaction, without changing the actual result of the transaction (I.e. I still pay you 5 BTC).
Because of this, it was difficult to rely on a transaction Id to do things off chain, because you could not be guaranteed that was how it would be represented onchain.  Among other things, this reduces the security of off-chain solutions by adding additional attack vectors.

I've always wondered what constitutes a large txn in this world.  An entire company's weekly payroll as one or two batched transactions could potentially be a "large txn" that happens directly on the base layer, but if every company is doing that then it starts competing for space with LN opens/closes.
On the other hand, lump-sum paychecks could evolve into continuous payment streams over LN where you are paid every second you are on the clock or whatever.  I guess this would only be limited by how reasonable it is for a company to keep their sides of the channels funded.

When the merchants node sees the transaction enter their mempool, they know it's a valid transaction.  I.e. the transaction adheres to all relevant consensus rules, is part of the same chain theerchant follows, the user has the funds, etc.
The only thing they don't know is exactly how long it will be before it's included in a block.  But that is entirely mitigated by a BIP which enables the merchant to set the fee when they provide the consumer the QR code or whatever toake the payment.  Now the fee is defined by the receiver, and they have greater control over how much risk they're willing to tolerate that a consumer attempts a double spend.

It facilitates adoption, though.  Imagine a merchant begins accepting BTC through one of these services.  Some time passes and one of the vendors they purchase supplies from also begins accepting BTC through a similar service.
The merchant now has the option to begin accepting BTC directly, instead of having it immediately converted to Fiat, then use that BTC to pay this upstream vendor.  Repeat this process up the entire supply chain and suddenly that supply chain no longer needs Fiat to operate.
In this fashion, these payment services facilitate the adoption of BTC by enabling different people or merchants at different points in the system to begin using BTC as if the entire system had already adopted it.
This is definitely real adoption.  It does not matter to the buyer what the seller does with the currency after the transaction is complete.  If I sell something to you, and immediately convert the USD you gave me into Gold, Euros, or Pizza, it does not matter to you at all.
(Gold = invests it, Euro = turn it into another currency, Pizza = purchase something with it)

Thats really not true, though.  If some mining pool existed that only took malicious transactions, it would still require enough of the networks hash power to at least have a chance at finding a block before the legitimate miners do.
Among other things, it would also require enough revenue through fees to justify the significant cost of attaining and maintaining that hash power, and continually purchase more when the difficulty increases.  At that point, they likely have to include legitimate transactions in their blocks as well, likely even forgoing the doublespend business to remain profitable.

I never said it was impossible.  I said you can't cancel a transaction, and that is true.  Once a transaction is in the mempool, the only way to get it out of the mempool is to invalidate it, and to invalidate it you would need to attempt something like a double spend, which both you and I agree is technically possible, but difficult to do.  Because it's difficult to do, it is both unlikely that the average Joe would attempt it, and unlikely that it's "worth doing" for a would-be attacker for small transactions.

Pretty much.  Though there are also some other advancements which help solve these problems more elegantly than "just add more people".  One example is the ability to split a payment over multiple routes.  For example, if I wanted to send you 10btc that would normally require one lump sum payment, but can now be automatically split up into two 5btc payments, four 2.5btc, or any other (not necessarily equal) division, all without your knowledge.  The payee still gets the same 10btc in the end, but it was done in a slightly different way.
