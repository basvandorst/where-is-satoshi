Supply side and trickle down and been tried and failed.

Different types of pounds. For many precious metals and gems they use "troy" weight.  So a pound sterling was 12 troy ounces which is a single troy pound.

You do realize that the state of the Middle East today is directly caused by British and French imperialism right?

Yea why are people acting surprised? We knew the NSA could do this.  Fucking Orwell talked about it in the 50s.

Well, freedom of speech is a concept. Its the First Amendment of the US Consitution that limits the (US) government.

Maybe they should stop pretending to be a public forum then.

Elections and if those arent good enough, revolution.  But liberals hate changing the status quo though. 


Good job on moving goal posts before i even had a chance.  
Example; Wells Fargo, facebook and their data collection, polluting of rivers by energy companies (Duke Energy and coal ash deposits).  Hsbc was found guilty of laundering money for cartels and terrorists and got off essentially with no punishment.

Have you ever read anything by Marx or other socialist/ real anarchist?  Capital is a stupid long book.

Try spamming this message a few more times, thatll really help.

Is that supposed to be an insult or comback of some kind? If so, it was weak.

Without a state, there is nothing to protect your right to private property. Also you do believe that private for profit industries are really going to be any better than current state apparatuses once the largest check on their power is gone?

And if that service decides to take all your shit who are you gonna go to? The private courts and private police? John Locke and Adam Smith even realized the importance that the state has. 


Corporations get away with all kinds of shit all the time and give zero fucks as long as they made profit.  If you honestly believe that without a real mass democratic check on private corporate power, that corporations would all the sudden be totally ethical you are bafflingly naive.

So when the prices crashes do you still say this?
@_date: 2019-10-23 19:16:53
Also bullshit on the 2005 partas well.

Shhh, youre breaking the narrative

Did you vote, run for office, protest petition the government for change? If not you consented by not trying to change it. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 17:08:21
Because it protects their property. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 18:33:22
And if they run off before you shoot them or it happened while youre gone what then?
@_date: 2018-04-05 18:07:55
If someone breaks into your house who do you go to?
@_date: 2018-04-05 21:24:21


I know you are but what am I?
@_date: 2018-04-05 17:07:47
Socialism isnt the government doing stuff.  
@_date: 2018-04-05 21:02:42
Only in libertarian ancap fantasy world does that really work.  Companies get away with far worse shit all the time. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 20:33:39
And if that private service stole all your shit what then?
