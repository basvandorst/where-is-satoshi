Is it worth it to buy more on top of the original amount at a higher price?
@_date: 2019-06-22 00:49:19
I’ve been at it since 7k this year but last year I was way more in for a few months after the big drop but sold because I needed the money.
@_date: 2019-06-25 23:37:04
Ok cool I’ll look into it thanks
@_date: 2019-06-04 17:43:59
So much for 9000 lol
@_date: 2019-06-22 01:16:33
This lmfao
@_date: 2019-06-26 06:47:03
I could’ve been a billionaire ��
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:04:59
When will I learn my lesson about trying to day trade bitcoin :/
@_date: 2019-06-22 01:59:31
Just did
@_date: 2019-06-22 01:55:25
Well I bought back in even though I probably should’ve waited for a dip ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
@_date: 2019-06-26 06:37:30
Coinbase pro?
@_date: 2019-06-22 00:35:12
Yeah 10k could be the low given time and it won’t matter so maybe
@_date: 2019-06-25 23:29:28
The only thing is that coinbase takes forever to put money in
@_date: 2019-06-26 06:21:45
I should’ve sold at 12900 and bought back in at 12400 :(
@_date: 2019-06-22 01:44:22
Just did and I’m so gonna regret it
@_date: 2019-06-22 03:35:19
If you can’t beat them join them
@_date: 2019-06-22 00:27:16
I’m so mad I sold at 9k because I thought it would be like the first time it hit it and now it’s probably too late buy back in because it’s way up.
@_date: 2019-06-22 00:37:03
Been there done that I’m just seeing what happens
@_date: 2019-06-25 23:33:27
Does that do it instantly or do I have to wait a few days like coinbase pro?
@_date: 2019-05-17 03:40:46
This is way too stressful I’m getting out of bitcoin when (if) I break even
@_date: 2019-05-17 04:00:22
That’s what I get for listening to my brother
@_date: 2019-05-19 10:40:02
Woah I’ve been getting drunk af for my 21st what a pleasant surprise the price of bitcoin
@_date: 2019-05-30 17:43:50
Well I slept in and missed the whole thing
@_date: 2019-05-17 03:51:51
Well I bought it at 8200 but with the Coinbase fees it’s like I bought it if it was at 8600 or so.
@_date: 2019-05-17 04:13:27
It is money that I can afford to lose but it kinda sucks when you see it drop so much. My brother knows a lot about bitcoin (or so I thought) and he said that I’ll double my investment. I may have exaggerated about the fee difference it’s more like 300 on top of where I bought it at but I think I really got ripped off on coinbase.
