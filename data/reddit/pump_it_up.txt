I don't know what method that chart is using, but it certainly isn't merely 30-day historical volatility as it claims.
For instance on certain days it claims that the volatility was '0.00%'. Wat.
This is what the 30-day smoothed historical volatility looks like (using Bitstamp prices as source):
Unfortunately, I can't figure out how to apply linear regression to the historical volatility, but just take a look at the shape of it. There are higher peaks in volatility being hit in 2013 and 2014 than in 2012, and it looks like on the whole volatility is moving up. The lows for instance are in 2012. Even if you want to say there is no single trend you can identify, then that wouldn't make the case for volatility decreasing over time.

So you're saying that the volatility won't start to decrease until demand is saturated?
Because a lot of people here have said to me that they believe that volatility will decrease *as a consequence of* increasing adoption (in other words, as it's happening).

Let's not argue about semantics. I don't think poverty of language in this case obscures the point.
The point I make is quite plain: That an increase in adoption begets volatility in an immediate sense.

No, because I would put it to you that volatility has in fact increased. Just compare 2012 to 2013 or this year so far for example.
Bitcoiners have told me in the past that they believe that volatility has been decreasing, and that it will continue to decrease as adoption increases.
