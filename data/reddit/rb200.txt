Thank you. Now if it is possible to count by hand and manually, where can I put that guess in the software so that my mining machine can validate if it is a correct number or not?

Then I guess that's not for me...

But the computer is STILL trying. Like there is somewhere in the software where it looks like this, for example:
xxxxx &lt;-fail
xxxxy &lt;-fail
xxxxt &lt;-WIN (publishing it to the blockchain)
And depending on how fast your computer can hash it does like millions of calculations each second as I've understood it. I wonder where I can actually SEE it happening and not only see on the mining software that SOMETHING is calculating in, for example, 100 mh/s. 
Here is a picture of a mining software counting as I've talked about. Down to the right you can see 698 mh/s. Now where can I actually see it running? I want to see the 698 mh/s running and not only stare at a software and it's number. For me, right now, that's only numbers. It's only a software counting thanks to the power of your computer.
Edit: I'm curious, I like the idea of Bitcoin and I want to understand it.

Thank you for your answer. It kinda sucks that there is no way of calculating the nounce by hand and put it in the mining software so that the software can validate it. But maybe in the future!
Edit: And yeah, the chance of actually finding a fitting nounce is so small that it's not even worth it against the computer powers I know :P But it sure would be fun to try it!

My friend, thank you for your answer but you mush have misunderstood me.
What I'm asking my friend, is I want to SEE the nodes trying and failing to verify if they have found a new block. Like you know when the computer is hashing in 100 mh/s they are calculating something and failing until they have found a valid block. My question is - how do I SEE the nodes count? (what program, software) 
Also that guy typing in by paper is fine, thank you for that link, I've seen it before. But I would like to have a software where I put my own numbers in it and where the computer is hashing and validating if it is a valid hash or not. Is that possible with any software?

How do i see the nodes counting trying to find a new block? And is there a way for humans to try to guess the hash manually, by hand, to try to find a new block?

That looks awesome :)
I've been searching and I've seen some information telling me that you can actually see validated blocks in your CMD. Is that true?
