Makes sense to diversify trading platforms at this point.
I like Gemini, the only downside is they don't have charts built in like GDAX. I use Cryptowatch to suppliment that - no lag that I can see.

Appreciate the insight. At least it has security going for it. It also looks like everyone else got hit by the same issue. Was able to login about 6 hours later.

What software are you using to generate this chart? I have Bittrex but not this pretty.

Is there any live coverage on TV? Would love to see some financial analysts talk about this.

Both Coinbase and Gemini are not working.

Is anyone seeing a relationship between BTC, ETH, and LTC? It seems like there is an inverse thing going on with ETH and BTC. Could people be selling off ETH to buy more BTC? Is that kind of speculation even useful?

nice! none of my exchanges are working but im glad to see someone can take advantage of it!

$1K swing and no one could take advantage of it because the trading platforms were down. :(

Looks like Coinbase, Bittrex, and Gemini are all experiencing technical issues. Huge dip just now but no way to take advantage of it.

Anyone here use Gemini and have any idea about what's going on? 
It went down this morning during the dip and has been showing the same "undergoing maintenance" message for hours now. No emails from the platform with an explanation. Starting to get a little concerned.

Is Gemini a small exchange? I would love to get an email from them with exactly what you wrote.

Helpful! Thanks!
