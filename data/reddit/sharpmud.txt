You are forgetting about the closing transactions. Batching does not reduce the transaction sizes for closing transactions thus the best you can hope for is 50% as 50% would mean opening transactions have a size of 0


That sounds pretty centralized. You are describing a single hub controlled by an entity very similar to todays banks.


That is because you are not using the currency. What is going on today matters alot to the people attempting to free themselves from the system. We do not want banks 2.0. I want to be able to frictionlessly send money. What you are describing is a permissioned system and I don't want it.


Pressure on BTC is not spurring anything, it is holding it back. We have to rebuild all of the infrastructure built around BTC on BCH now. We need to convince the people who reluctantly accepted BTC to switch to BCH. This is alot of work and it will become much harder when BTC crashes. Alot of trust is being lost because of the damage done by Core.


The infighting is caused by an absolute refusal to scale. That is the sole reason. Core could not even allow a modest 2 megabyte block. The narrative that the users wanted Segwit has been thoroughly debunked by the fact that they are not using it.
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:18:07


Why don't you add up how many people there are and divide by the number of transactions that can fit in a block. I'll let you assume you are able to optimize the transaction size somehow 50%. How long will each person have to wait for his turn to enter a lightning network hub? That will help you with one variable.

I know that from a layman's perspective decentralization may look like a binary question but it isn't. There are levels of decentralization and torrents are very decentralized. If they were not decentralized then I would not have been able to download Game of Thrones without any questions asked. If governments were able to stop illegal torrenting, like they did with the centralized Napster, they would.
Bitcoin Core has a very centralized entity called the Core developers. They decide what upgrades get into the system and which ones do not. 2x was stopped by them. Segwit was added by them. It is laughable how centralized it is and LN would make it even more so. 
You seem far too knowledgeable not to know better. It is far more likely that you know you are full of shit then you actually believe this crap.

@_date: 2017-12-21 19:22:14


You need to set a closing time when you open the transaction. The closing time is how long your funds are locked up. This is an important metric because the longer they are locked up the more control the hub has over your money. If you set it for a year, then that entity can decide that your money will not move for a year. This is a very common problem with todays banks as they will often freeze accounts that look suspicious. This is a problem that we have solved with Bitcoin, but Core decided to unsolve it with LN.


No, I knew Bitcoin would give us freedom over our money. What you are describing is a system where I never control my own keys. At least one key to my money is always in someone else's control. Money is always being transferred through permissioned systems. This is another thing we solved already and Core has brought us backward.


We had instant payments before LN. Before the first block was mined Satoshi was describing using Bitcoin to pay for webpage views instead of looking at ads. This has been in the design since the inception.


You never needed to wait at the store for several minutes. Stores never made you wait for a confirmation. I sold a few bitcoins to a pro trader on localbitcoins. He did not make me wait for a confirmation even though it was more then a 30k transaction. This is really common and very safe. If it were not safe then he would have been ripped off during the 4 years he has been trading. 


That is a good idea. Why won't Core use a different coin? Increasing the blocksize is Bitcoin's scaling system. It is in the design. This is what we all signed up for and some asshats that admittedly don't use the system now want to tell us how it should work.

@_date: 2017-12-21 13:27:37


You were being an asshole, and one that is also clearly poorly informed.
Torrents are decentralized. A tracker allows people to find each other and after using a tracker we can send files directly between each other. We aren't sending the data through the tracker. This is similar to Bitcoin as we have about 10 nodes that we first connect to that introduces us to the network. These nodes are hard coded. Did you know that? 
You were saying that hardware requirements would make Bitcoin Cash centralized. Centralization is not defined by how many nodes run the code. 4 nodes would still be decentralized as long as other nodes can seamless enter the system.




That's not what I said. I said we don't need a system that is decentralized simply to serve as a museum piece. It must be useful or it is useless. There is literally no difference in decentralization between Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Core except if you count the dev team. Bitcoin Core has a centralized dev team.
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:08:03


You realize you are talking about yourself right?
Novice investors never cared about the technicals, otherwise Bitcoin Cash would have already taken over. $200 fees are not feasible. LN isn't ready and even if it were you would still need to increase the blocksize. Didn't Tony say Segwit would solve all of your problems? How did that work out for you?
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:05:48
What exactly is it's plan? Force everyone to HODL by making the fees so high it is impossible to do anything else?
I hate to break it to you but no one is going to spend $200 to enter into a LN hub. Also, spoiler, making entering LN expensive leads to centralization.. ie the dark side woohohooho
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:55:19


What they say and what is true are mutually exclusive. They said segwit would solve all of our scaling problems. They said we need a fee market. They said that they proved Bitcoin was impossible. What credibility do they have?


I don't think you are right about the trust staying with Core. It is a more expensive coin, but that is the investors not the users. The wallets for Cash are still being developed so it is a slow process adopting the fork, but we are moving over. Soon the investors will follow. If you were using the coin you would know what I mean. Properly backing up wallets take time, switching wallets takes time, and convincing merchants to adopt BCH takes time. I could not use BCH when it first forked, and it will be a while before I can use it as often as I can use BTC today.


That's funny, because that is what Core is doing. Look at theymos's history

If you are going to quote someone then you should mention who you are quoting. 
Who do you think is in charge of Bitcoin? The developers? I hate to break it to you but several different groups of people are in charge of making decisions and one very large group is the miners. This is like three (or four) branches of the American government. Each branch has power and that power is limited by the other branches. In Bitcoin we have the miners, the developers, the users and the merchants. Each has power and each makes decisions.

@_date: 2017-03-22 22:46:42
HOLDLers are in charge? No man. You need to use the currency to have power. Some guy with a ton of coins he is not using has no say in this debate. If you are not running mining software, writing code, spending bitcoins, or accepting bitcoin in your business, then you are doing nothing to support bitcoin and as a result no one really cares what you think. 
Miners have a ton of power. They can attack any competing chain, they create the security of the current chain. They do far more for Bitcoin then some wannabe investors sitting on coins hoping to become millionaires.
Businesses have a ton of power. By switching to competing currencies Bitcoin looses market share, users, and utility. More and more companies are switching away from bitcoin to etherium because of high fees and long confirmation times. 
Developers have power too. By writing code they get to decide what features added and bugs are fixed. Without developers we cannot change the proof of work algorithm. Ability to chang the proof of work and threats of doing so, is an important protection against miner abuse.
Wallet Developers create the tools neccisary for users to use bitcoin. Without a large variety of them the wallets are clunky and difficult to use. Look at Litecoin and see what happens when time and money is not spent on creating tools to help the user experience. Without wallet developers we will never get the average people to use Bitcoin as the experience would require too much technical knowledge.
Users decide which cryptocurrency they wish to purchase and use. Users tell businesses they want to use Bitcoin and support Bitcoin by spending bitcoins. When companies see additional bitcoin profits from their users they inform other businesses which expands bitcoin adoption.
Some holders are also merchants, users, developers and miners, but pure Holders don't code, they don't use bitcoin, they just sit on their ass. Holding bitcoin does not give you any power over the network, it is only holders that are in other categories that have power.
The honey badger isn't Bitcoin. The honey badger is cryptocurrencies. The honey badger isn't going anywhere, but Bitcoin might. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 21:29:05






I could repeat the same back to you.
Segwit allows a max block **weight** of 4 megabytes. The is the maximum size of the data that the miners need to store to properly validate transactions and prove that the transactions are in fact valid. The data that is being hashed, however, remains at 1 megabyte and this data is referred to as the block size. It is important to note the distinction so that we can differentiate between different scaling options and also so that we can refer to the data being shared with legacy clients.
I understand you do not agree with the lexicon I use. If we were to set aside that debate aside for a second, can you point out anything that I said that is incorrect?
@_date: 2017-03-14 01:34:56
That's a fallacy. It is possible to not want SegWit while at the same time wanting bigger blocks. You should listen to the other side every once in a while.
@_date: 2017-08-03 19:24:21
Gavin is the one that was leading the charge. We didn't hear anything about miners supporting it until recently. This has always been early adopters supporting bigger blocks which is why the poll that allowed people to vote by stake overwhelmingly voted for bigger blocks.
@_date: 2017-08-31 16:46:44
I see that it covers the header, you are right about that. I never looked that closely at the blocks before and mistakenly thought they were hashing the entire block rather then the header.
I still stand by my statement of 1 megabyte blocks however. Calling the entire data a block is designed to mislead. We have been asking for a literal block increase for quite a while. Calling segwit a block increase is an attempt to make it look like BS is giving the users what they want. Whether this is your intention is irrelevant as this is the primary purpose that BS is pushing this narrative.
You can't say Segwit is the same as 4 megabyte blocks as the number of trasactions is not equivalent to a literal 4 megabyte block. Can you deny this? Do you deny that calling Segwit a block size increase could confuse users into thinking it is the same as literally increasing the block size?
If you are not a shill, then I do not understand why you are so insistent on calling it a 4 megabyte block when it is very clear there are important differences between a 4 megabyte block (by my definition) and Segwit.


Don't be an ass. Calling me brainwashed just makes you sound childish. This Roger Ver hate is completely unfounded and perpetuating it only serves to make you look like the one being manipulated.
@_date: 2017-08-24 00:05:06
The blocksize is 2 megabytes with 2x. If you would read the white paper you would see that the block is the file that is being hashed by the miners.
@_date: 2017-08-04 18:57:14
All this fighting over a small 2 megs makes me worried that when we have full blocks again they will remain full for another 2 years before a size increase. That will give other altcoins another big boost and further hurt the confidence bitcoin currently enjoys.
Lightning network cannot work with full blocks. This is because the refund transactions are time sensitive. If the fee increases substantially when the refund is sent, it opens up the possibility for double spends. Bitcoin's entire decentralization and trustless model falls apart the second blocks become consistently full. If you want it to be decentralized then we need to ensure that Bitcoin is affordable to the masses. The only way we can ensure that everyone can afford to use bitcoin is with full blocks and cheap on chain transactions. This will allow us to make even cheaper off chain transactions.
So I do not think Segwit will go as far as you think. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 21:58:42




With a misplaced decimal :-). My mistake.


I do not believe there is any real support for 1x. I believe that a large percentage of the support is manufactured by blockstream with the use of puppet accounts. We will see though. 
I am guessing you support it, but you are probably not a miner. If you are not planning on mining 1x, then your vote does not count. I think anyone with any skin in the game will mine 2x because they know that Bitcoin cannot wait any longer for a larger scaling solution then segwit offers. Bitcoin cash will take over IMO if 1x because the dominate chain.
You are right though, Etherium didn't expect the classic fork to get enough interest. I would bet good money that 1x will not survive 6 months if it does not get the majority of hash power. We will see though.
You should remember though that Etherium had an easier time forking then bitcoin will. I believe their difficulty adjustments are quicker. If 1x gets 25% support, which I really doubt, they will have a really hard time for the first month and a half with 32min blocks. If they get 10%, which I think is much more likely, then it will be four months of blocks taking an hour each. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 21:30:11


You are lumping Gavin into this category as well. Is he also an ignorant newb? 
I see you claimed to be a developer but how much have you actually used Bitcoin? I doubt you have used Bitcoin half as much as I have. Calling me a newb is simply untrue.

@_date: 2017-08-28 23:28:04


Sure, I was exaggerating a bit. What I meant was 'I believe the support for 1x is very small'. I do not place much weight in developers who do not serve the users and the users have been very clearly in support of increasing the blocksize. I make a distinction between users and investors by the way, if you are not making a bitcoin purchase at least every month then you are not a user.


1 CPU 1 Vote. That is how Bitcoin was designed. 1 Hash 1 vote would be more accurate, but the idea is clear enough. I don't remember if that was in the white paper or satoshi's correspondence, but that is Bitcoin's design.


If Bitcoin 1x ends up with more hash power then 2x, then Bitcoin cash will eventually overtake them both. Bitcoin cannot survive on 1 meg blocks and mechants will begin using Bitcoin Cash instead. That is what I meant. I see the confusion.


You are a fool if you do not think exchanges will value B2X. I think you have listened to too many liars. To be fair, you might believe the same about me. Time however will show us the truth.
Without hashpower 1x will not be valued highly. Users are sick of Blockstreams crap and will flock to the coin with the most utility. Investors may prop up 1x temporarily, but they will lose their money quickly.
@_date: 2017-08-29 18:11:20






All bytes in a block are hashed, but it isn't 4 megs. If you hashed 4 megabytes of data it would be rejected by legacy nodes. You need to send them a 1 megabyte block or it becomes a hard fork.
Your masters have lied to you. Do your own research.


By what definition would it be an alt coin. The white paper does not set a blocksize limit so whichever chain has the most hashpower behind it is Bitcoin.


I do. These are facts. They cannot be disputed. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 23:09:18
You are saying that the data being hashed is not 2 megabytes? It is one megabyte, this is easy to look up. Perhaps you are talking about after 2x. Afterwards it will be 2 megabytes.
The data being hashed is referred to as the block as per the whitepaper. Are you going to dispute that?
Try being less obvious next time shill. I see you for what you are.
@_date: 2017-08-03 19:26:30


You cannot scale to Visa levels without bigger blocks. Lighting network still requires on chain transactions. If you do not increase the blocksize, then you will not be able to afford to make bitcoin transactions, on chain or otherwise.
@_date: 2017-08-29 20:18:11




How about we try logic instead.
Segwit is a soft fork correct? 
Softforks are upgrades that allow legacy nodes to continue running without upgrading correct?
Legacy nodes believe the block size is 1 megabyte and are not aware of Segwit correct?
Is any of this incorrect?
Legacy nodes expect a 1 megabyte hashed block sent to them. If they get a block bigger then 1 megabyte then they reject it correct?
If there is a 1 megabyte hashed block how can their be a 4 megabyte block as well? Do you believe the miners are hashing both?

It wants to upgrade the Bitcoin chain to 2 megabytes. They do not need replay protection because we will not have 2 chains for very long. Neither 1x nor 2x has a difficulty adjustment and cannot survive without significant hashpower. With 25% of the hashpower it will take ~~1 year and a half~~ (edit: a month and a half) before the difficulty adjusts. The chain will not be usable with that hash rate. It is possible new miners will enter the scene to save the minority chain, but it is unlikely.

@_date: 2017-08-29 23:57:21










That's not how it works. Hashing is the proof of work miners do to create a valid block. This requires a lot of work and if you want to hash both then that is twice as much work. What they do is create a 1 megabyte block with references to the segwit data and do the proof of work (or hash) on the 1 megabyte block. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 23:23:46




Maybe the equivalence of 1.7 meg blocks, but that isn't the same thing as a blocksize increase. You are well aware of what I mean.


The blocks are full Greg, now only 25% of the transactions that are currently going through will go through. With segwit that will be 42.5%, but that is assuming 0 growth. Here comes 20$ transaction costs.
@_date: 2017-08-29 18:25:53






People are using Bitcoin Cash. Have you not seen any of the tip bots? 
I agree not many people are using it however, but that is because very few wallets support it. I cannot spend Bitcoin Cash with Electrum or Mycelium and switching requires trusting new unknown wallets like Coinomi and finding a way to migrate my coins. Most users will follow whatever Coinbase, Mycelium, Electrum, and Localbitcoins tell them is Bitcoin.






That's bullshit. They are support of lining their pockets. Bitcoin Cash forked without any security problems. Segwit is not at all a compromise as it doesn't give us anything that we want. We want bigger blocks not a convoluted new set of rules. We are still paying $7 a transaction.






Not really. Do you call Google Investors users if they use Bing? Investors like to call themselves users and paint themselves as experts but have little idea what is going on when they are not actually using the currency. Early adopters like myself are asking places to accept bitcoin and learning what does and does not work. We are the users, not those moon kids who want to tell others how things they do not use should work.






According to who? The Core developers? The whitepaper did not mention a blocksize, so changing it still stays within the boundaries of Bitcoin. If you were to change something like the inflation rate, however, then it would cease to be bitcoin.


There is no rule that dictates the blocksize in Bitcoin, thus it is something that can be voted on by hashpower. This is how we implemented Segwit. Do you think they should be able to vote on Segwit but not the blocksize? Sounds kinda arbitrary.






I am saying that if B2X does not survive, and I doubt it will without the majority of hash power, then Bitcoin 1x will become too expensive to use. Then it will only be a matter of time before Bitcoin 1x loses significant market share to Bitcoin Cash.






Yes, and you moon kids do not have enough money to sway anything. The early adopters will dump your shit coin.


Blocksize and security are not correlated. If we keep Bitcoin small, like the bankers want, then it will not be able to compete on a global scale. That is what small blocks do, not improve security.






We saw that hashpower has more wisdom then that. Look at Bitcoin Cashes historic prices.






They fund propoganda censorship and character attacks. Are you really unaware of that? Do you really think this hate towards Ver is justified? That was created by a concerted effort and is no way organic.
We don't need Blockstream to fund it, Bitcoin was being developed fine before them.

I was very active at that time I do not remember any complaints. If you want to link to specific threads to back up your point I will check them out, but I don't think you will find any.
Everything worked fine until it didn't. The price on MtGox kept going up and there was opportunity to make money. Once it got too high, however, I started to get worried as should anyone.
I do not think Roger Ver acted maliciously. It is likely he was shown the bank statements showing exactly how many US dollars there was supposed to be. That would have been enough for me, but obviously checking the bitcoin balances would have been a good idea. I believe I would have made the same mistake as him.

Attacking the current consensus? We have don't any consensus for him to attack. This idea that we have consensus for Segwit is a lie. There are many people deeply opposed to it and not just miners with ASCIBoost.






LukeJr says it quite often. I am not certain if I have heard it from others, but here we are still at 1 megabyte no one in wants to admit that Segwit is not enough. What I do hear repeatedly is the need for a fee market, and how transactions should be expensive. Bitcoin was designed to open the world up to finance, not just the ones that could afford it.
@_date: 2017-04-07 03:01:56
First off, it would not be the end of Bitcoin. Miners need to be able to cash out their coins for mining to be worth while. It would not be in their interest to devalue the currency they mine.
Second off ASCIBoost does not do this, so it isn't relevant to our discussion. Are you really trying to compare mining empty blocks to preferring transactions based upon compatibility rather then fee?
In order to call this an attack you must show harm and intent. Where is the harm?

You didn't mention any potential upgrades, you were vague. I assumed you were talking about Segwit, but really it doesn't matter for this discussion.


So creating a protocol that is more efficient but lowers the number of transactions mined per block is an attack? If ASCIIBoost does that then it appears they are not running ASCIIBoost because every block is full. 
Of course if you believe creating code that limits the number of transactions per block is an attack on Bitcoin, I think you should have a talk with Bitcoin Core as by your logic they are attacking Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-04-07 01:55:59
Optimization is exactly what it is. The protocol did not design the hashing algorithm nor does it say how the hash must be calculated.
As far as choices we have quite a few, but we aren't talking about this. If you want to debate the merits of Segwit then that would be a worthwhile discussion, but I will not allow you to push Segwit by spreading misinformation. 
This is not an attack. There are many good reasons to activate Segwit, but this is not one of them.

No you are missing the point. I understand the conflict of interest argument. I agree there is a conflict of interest. 
The entire point of this post is to call out the lie that this is an attack. Gregory Maxwell's post is disingenuous. There are many other posts that are equally disingenuous. This is not an attack, it is simply optimized code. There is nothing wrong with writing better code, or trying to make hardware that is more efficient.

As far as the anti-core crusade, there are many different camps there, each with their own beliefs, and motivations. 
I think we can both agree, however, they have been holding back the blocksize. It has been said multiple times by Core and Blockstream that a fee market is good and full blocks are good. How good do you think full blocks are now that people are migrating to other coins?

That is not a strawman. You can win debates by throwing out fallacies you do not understand. 
In order to have a productive conversation we need to use correct words. Attack is the wrong word. Optimizing code is not an attack, ever. 
Your problem is the miners have a conflict of interest because of ASCIBoost. That is a valid complaint. It is possible they are blocking SegWit entirely because of it's incompatibility with ASCIBoost. Even if that is true, ASCIBoost is not an attack.

I have studied it. What is and is not too complex is a belief. It adds additional complexity to Bitcoin. It is also far too small of a block size increase. We need much more then it is offering.

The developers are lying and misleading you. 
They are attempting to lead you to believe this is something that it is not. Some guy came up with an algorithm that mines bitcoin more efficiently. That is not an attack and any claim to the contrary is a lie.
'The blocks are not full. Most transactions are spam'. That is a lie. I don't see miners lying I see Core developers lying. That is concerning. Why are will still at 1 meg?

ASCIBoost doesn't prevent anything. It is just an optimization. That in no way makes it an attack.
Jihan is not signaling for Segwit. Is ASCIBoost the primary reason he is against it? Neither of us know that, but it really doesn't matter. He doesn't owe you or anyone anything. If you want to fork to Segwit he isn't stopping you. Go ahead and fork.
But before you go ahead acusing him of being the bad guy you might want to look a little closer at what is really going on. If Maxwell really reverse engineered his code then Maxwell could leak the code removing all of Jihan's advantage. Since this code hasn't been leaked I think Maxwell is full of shit.

Segwit does not bring down the powerful and corrupt. 
We need bigger blocks. We need them soon. Segwit is not enough. We should be doing 8 megabyte blocks by now. The whole idea of Bitcoin is to enable the impoverished to use Bitcoin. Enable the people in third world countries to accept payments internationally, and avoid their inflated currency.

Even if that is true, 1 megabyte is choking usage. What is Bitcoin for then? Is buying TVs ok? Cars? Houses? Is it for people who live on less then 10 dollars per day? 
1 meg is going to cut it any way you look at it.
I assume you will bring up LN. This is a cool idea, but it alone will stress the network more then 1 megabyte can handle. How often do you expect the average person will need to open or close a LN hub? with 7 billion people we would be lining up for 1 year to open up a new hub.

Were you there when I talked to people about Bitcoin Internet Stranger? What exactly did I say that gave you the impression that I forced my beliefs upon them rather then advising them with full disclosure? All of my friends and family are very happy with me in regards to Bitcoin.


I have no idea what that means. Please tell me what this means?




Those are some interesting glasses you have on. They are very cynical. You make merchants sound like parasites. You make advising people on good sound investments sound like preying on them. I do not give out specific investment advice out lightly. When I saw something as amazing as Bitcoin I felt obligated to tell friends and family about it. How could I keep this secret from them?
To answer your question I do not favor any particular company. I have helped people set up Coinbase and Bitpay accounts. Some companies did not use a payment processor and instead set up Mycelium wallets on each of their employees phones.
Merchants and I have similar goals. The more widely used Bitcoin is, the more money they will make. They are good for Bitcoin so I do not mind helping them out. You call it free labor, but I see it differently. I want more places to spend my bitcoin and by convincing merchants to accept it I am helping myself out. If merchants profit off of my work then thats even better.

No you weren't. It sounded like you were starting out with that assumption though, and something I said made you reconsider that assumption. Is that right?


We can disagree. That's ok. How did we get segwit though? It was stalled before Seg2x agreement came along.


That's not a great way to do it, as it is easy to add a bunch of commits that do not add value. I can grab some college kids and out commit the current dev team. It is my opinion that most of the things the current dev team added are damaging and scary. Segwit, and RBF for example.


That is really dangerous thinking. You are suggesting that Bitcoin should have a centralized development team. Please no. Bitcoin is designed in a way where we can have 20 different teams writing different clients that all work together. That is where we need to be. Somewhere where developers threating to quit has no effect on the community or protocol.


If we were to fork off the network when segwit was added, would you have fought this hard for the devs to add replay protection to the Segwit fork? I doubt it. 


I am not sure how you brought the dicks into this. Mines about average, you may have me beat.

Think about it some more.
What percentage of nodes were signaling UASF?
Also let's ask what the acronyms stand for. User Activate Soft Fork. A soft fork does not result in a chain split. The entire purpose of UASF was to split non segwit blocks off of the network. The name is an oxymoron.

Thats not true. Why don't you back that up with some sources.
If the dev community was so convinced that this was a good idea why didn't they discuss this with the users and get their opinion? It seems far better for an open project to discuss these ideas openly rather then forcing their beliefs on others with censorship and coercion.

How are you determining which chain is the most decentralized? If there are two mining farms mining 1x and 5 mining 2x, would you call 2x more decentralized?


Obviously there are actual developers as they have written actual code. As far as the quality of the code I suspect you haven't read it and are thus unqualified to judge.

Adding full replay protection kicks older clients off of the network. It makes all current wallets incompatible. 
We want the 2x fork to be called Bitcoin, and adding replay protection would cause to be an alt coin
@_date: 2017-10-29 19:00:05
It has been 3 years. We could have done it before the blocks were full. In two more years the devs would have another reason to delay. Sorry. That reason is no longer believable. We are increasing it next month.

Entitlement suggests I think they should do it for me. I am not sure why you think big blockers are entitled. We want to scale Bitcoin because we want to use Bitcoin to do well.
Bitcoin must scale soon for two reasons: 1) so that it does not lose market share and get replaced by an altcoin, 2) so that it gets too big to get shut down. The smaller it is the easier it is for companies like Blockstream to kill it.

How exactly does that measure consensus? Running reference nodes are cheap. It requires little investment. I could spin up a million on amazon today and what would that prove?
More then a million dollars in bitcoin disagrees with you and thinks that bigger blocks are the solution. I tend to trust those that have something to lose, like miners who invested millions in infrastructure and users who are holding bitcoins. Hash rate doesn't lie, vote by stake doesn't lie, twitter on the other hand can, node count can

Early adoption means you could recognize Bitcoin for what it is and what it could be. You didn't need someone else to tell you it's significance. It is a test of understanding. Everyone can see how useful the internet is today. If you saw it during it's early stages, odds are you would have dismissed it. Greg was one of those people who dismissed Bitcoin. He even claimed to have proven it was impossible. Best developers I keep hearing but the facts don't back that claim up.

As am I. I do not rely on one proxy however, and instead speak to many.
Roger Ver, may not be right, but it is hard to argue that he wants to destroy Bitcoin. He is known as Bitcoin Jesus because he has been promoting Bitcoin since it's inception. If you want another proxy to balance things out I would listen to what he has to say. Again, he could be wrong, but I can guarantee that he knows what he is talking about and believes it.

They don't
I am not certain what you are talking about. Are you asking why some empty blocks are mined? That happens when the block is found before the miner had time to verify any transactions. It isn't common but it is how the code is written. This code was likely written by Core.
If that isn't what you are talking about then please point to some of the blocks you are talking about.
@_date: 2017-10-15 19:12:39


This is tiring. Assuming everyone is a paid shill makes it hard to learn about the other side.


No I don't. They are not disguising themselves as the real Bitcoin, as that would imply that they are not the real bitcoin. If you have the majority of hash power and follow the protocol, then you are the real Bitcoin. Adding replay protection would only serve to kick older clients off the network. It is up to the minority chain to add replay protection.


The majority of miners have been signaling Seg2x. They forked already. We are already off of core's chain. That is how we got segwit.


No Seg1x dies and Seg2x remains the dominant chain. BTC survives either way.


I agree. Why won't Core add replay protection? Running a minority chain without replay protection will harm those that wish to use this minority chain. 
Do you use Bitcoin? How often do you make Bitcoin purchases? Do you talk with many people who purchase Bitcoin regularly? If not then you are the attacker. We are just people wanting to use the system as it was designed. We are tired of $4 fees, it is getting too expensive to use this system.
@_date: 2017-10-15 19:17:25
This has been the design from the beginning. Big blockers are mostly made up of early adopters like myself and Ver. This is the design we signed up for, and we are tired of idiots that do not understand Bitcoin trying to tell up how it should work.
When I say idiots I mean people like Gregory Maxwell who claimed to have proved that cryptocurrencies could not work when he heard about Bitcoin. Now he is working full time on something he claimed was impossible. Now he is claiming it can only work with his changes.
Bitcoin worked great before him, and we do not need toxic people on this project. Look at what he did at Wikipedia if you doubt his toxicity.
We just mined our first gigabyte block on a testnet. We will have plenty of proof that Bitcoin scales without needing a LN soon, but Core won't care. Core will come up with more bullshit about how they are right and we are wrong.
If you do not like the design of bitcoin, and bitcoin is designed to have big blocks, then go to another project. There are plenty out there that will adopt your scaling method.
@_date: 2017-10-16 20:17:29




Can't the core individuals do that? Can't I make my own repository? 




Nice duck. How about a straight answer. You seem to think this is irresponsible of the 2x guys. Core planned on doing it's UASF on August 1st and that did not have replay protection. Was that not an attack on the network? Shouldn't they have added replay protection? 




I sometimes read too fast. Sorry about that. I prefer to compare this Seg2x vs 1x to a game of chicken.

@_date: 2017-10-27 00:40:50


You got it backward mate. The early adopters are in favor of the fork whereas the newbies all have NO2X on their twitter handle. Take a look at the vote by stake polls.
@_date: 2017-10-14 22:30:06




I won't survive? Really? I am going to be fine. I am also not an enemy agent of Ver's.
Increasing the blocksize is also the intended method of scaling. I also find it to be the least disruptive. Why do you think it is disruptive?
Every single block for the last few years has been full. We have no capacity to grow. How can you say it is unneeded? We need something or else this is as big as it will get.




Yet you claim the other side is an enemy of Bitcoin. We are all agents of evil or some shit. If there is a chance you are wrong then you should listen instead of attacking. 
I am not the boogie man. I may be totally wrong, but I have done more for Bitcoin then most in this sub. That isn't alot, but I have absolutely helped it grow. I am currently on boarding new users, teaching them how to setup wallets, teaching them how to backup their keys, and encouraging others to adopt it. **You don't know anything about me and yet you assume I have some secret evil agenda and I will be crushed by the forces of good.**




Don't tell me to go back to the whitepaper as I have read it. I read the conversations. I didn't see anything in there about a permanent blocksize cap. I did, however, read about how Bitcoin can handle Visa level transactions on chain. Satoshi was very clear about that. Do you think Satoshi is the enemy of Bitcoin?
We are at capacity and thus we cannot handle any more users. How can you argue that we are not being choked?




What does his felony conviction have to do with this conversation? Are all felons incapable of doing anything good, or having good motives? Have you actually looked into the details of his conviction and read what he had to say about it? 




If you cannot prove something, then do not parade it around as fact. If that is all you see then perhaps you are in an echo chamber.
Serious question: How often do you spend Bitcoins? Do you know anyone who spends bitcoins at least once a month? Do you go to local Bitcoin meetups or conventions? I am curious how many people you know in real life that are against this 2x.


Obviously there is opposition to 2x. You are evidence of that. I think most of it is astroturff. I may be wrong, but there is some evidence. Did you see the 1600 meetup members that claimed to be against it. Did you actually see any evidence presented that it was true? If you look a little deeper you will learn it is a total fabrication. One of the 1600 members was Roger Ver, and I don't think he agreed to that press release. Makes you wonder how many others didn't agree.

They can commit to whatever they like and we will commit to what we like. We like bigger blocks, so we are increasing the blocksize. They can stick with this legacy chain without any hash power.

@_date: 2017-10-14 22:48:03
Bitcoin Cash is working fine. The testnet just did it's first gigabyte block and are releasing the results soon. I wonder if you would change your mind if the results are positive.


Ok. So you agree the original design was to raise the blocksize cap correct? Look at this thread. Look at the bullshit here. Everyone is calling it an altcoin. How the fuck can it be an altcoin if this was the original design. Even if that design is flawed.


If these are big problems then why Segwit? Segwit makes those problems worse by introducing bloat. Every blocksize increase we make will include a 50% increase in block weight bloat as a result of segwit. There are solutions to Transaction Malleability without using Segwit.
@_date: 2017-10-15 19:21:29


If you don't use Bitcoin then you shouldn't be telling us how to use it. Bitcoin does not exist to make you rich.
A basic class in economics would teach you the folly of your thinking. Without liquidity, which is created by people like me, Bitcoin will not be useful as a store of value.
@_date: 2017-10-06 18:48:48
Miners are not concerned with Core releasing a POW change because no one will run it. Core is afraid of hard forks because miners control hard forks not developers, and changing POW is a hard fork. Once they change POW their version of Bitcoin instantly becomes an altcoin, and must choose a new name.
@_date: 2017-10-29 18:56:35


It is not a strawman if it is a commonly held belief. If you are in favor of larger blocks then what is wrong with this modest increase?


That is utter bullshit. 'Hard forks are bad mkay' is all I hear on this forum. If you believe the devs have any intention of increasing the blocksize via a hard fork you are delusional. 


Bullshit. Increasing the blocksize to 2 megabytes will have no effect on security or decentralization. Please link to a evidence that says otherwise.


That's bullshit. What are you basing that statement on?
Take a look at the vote by stake polls, they overwhelmingly vote in favor of increasing the blocksize. Go to meetups or bitcoin conventions, overwhelming support from the users to increase the blocksize. 


The only reason why this would 'replace' the core team is because the core team is threatening to rage quit. If the Core team would allow the community to decide by releasing a client that supported the 2x client then they would likely remain as the primary development team. They do not like allowing choice.


I might understand it better then the devs. It is hard to tell whether or not their actions are ignorant or malicious. There are major conflicts of interest going on right now with the development team. 
I think Satoshi understands scaling better then they do and his path involved bigger blocks. I think I understand it far better then someone who claimed to have proven Bitcoin was impossible. 
I see that adoption is stalled because of full blocks. I see the effects their leadership has had on the community and the lose of market share due to their actions.

This was a lie. I asked the guy making the claim for more details and/or proof and he has ignored me. 
r/btc found the meetup group and noticed that Ver was one of the members which obviously shed some doubt on the whole story. It is believed that the person making the claim asked the question in the meetup chat and some of the members said they were against, but most did not respond.

@_date: 2017-07-13 18:44:50


You just said that it's primary purpose is to secure Other Peoeple's Money, not a payment system. Blockstream wants to turn it into a settlement layer. Don't plead ignorance on this.
The original purpose of Bitcoin is to allow the world to pay for goods online, not just those who can afford it. The 1 megabyte cap was designed to be temporary. Blockstream has since hijacked bitcoin and convinced everyone the sky would fall if we removed the cap. Early adopters, like myself, want Bitcoin as it was originally designed.

RBF undermines the security of bitcoin. Small blocks undermines the security of bitcoin. Small blocks prevent a lightning network. You clowns have no idea how any of this works and you come here thinking you are experts.

The fork will put a soft 2 meg cap and a hard 8 meg cap. The miners will accept any block 8 meg or less, but only create 2 meg blocks. Pretty smart as we will need 8 megs very soon even with segwit.
@_date: 2017-07-14 17:57:38
Way too much to read. I never said it should only be a payment network. I said it should be a payment network first as the white paper described. The title says P2P payment system so obviously this is the primary function, and a store of wealth becomes secondary to that. There are many other uses which I am not against such as storing document hashes with immutable timestamps, which also I believe is discussed in the paper.
At 1 megabyte we no longer have a useful P2P network. Moving people off chain is an antithesis of this goal. If you want something that is a store of value first, then make a new coin for that purpose and stop trying to redefine what bitcoin is.
1 megabyte cap prevents this. S
@_date: 2017-07-25 20:18:24
Many on this forum are threatening not to activate the 2x portion. There are also a large number of people that do not want segwit and recognize Seg2x is not a compromise. This is for the people who want Bitcoin as it was designed. This is good as it will let the market decide which is better

They are afraid that BCC might be right and we may need to increase the blocksize. The hate is proof that people here are afraid of it.
