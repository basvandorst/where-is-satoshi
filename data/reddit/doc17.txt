Maybe I've seen the Bourne movies too many times.  But seriously, why fly to Zurich when you can bank anonymously in you pyjamas?

True enough...I spoke with the guy on the phone, and he said they were looking at a limit increase.  He does adjust as the price changes...this morning you could buy 0.05

Yes, bunched panties are tight and uncomfortable.  I agree with the educational angle, but worry that this constant stream of "hey I just lost..." posts will undermine the overall project of promoting BTC.  As the sidebar says, "you can be your own bank," which means be in control and feel secure (assuming that you accept that 'bank' in that statement means 'secure.'

I'm pretty excited about bitcoin. I'm trying to keep the focus on a means of exchange, but I'm also excited about the crazy valuations.  Pets.com was a moment-in-time...I think many (including me) believed that anyone with a decent web address and the shell of a store was going to succeed.  How wrong we were.
Bitcoin seems to be unique...both a counter-cultural approach to commerce and something that will appreciate in value.  Should be a hell of a ride.

Good problem to have!

Sadly, too many are unwilling to do their homework on bitcoin and try to take the shorter route of throwing a question up here.  Maybe is too pejorative.  Perhaps we should give over to the noobs and go to @_date: 2013-12-12 21:05:17
Pets.com...I lost it all on pets.com  Pets.com, I thought, how could I lose on a site called pets.com.  Even the domain name is valuable, I thought, so surely I won't lose what little money I have on pets.com.

You're right...I kinda expected he would become more entrepreneurial after the program, but the opposite happened—he became more timid.  Maybe I should send him a little more.

My Chinese family has related tales of excess cash, I mean cash by the tonne, sitting in warehouses and apartments.  One incident (not reported) led the police to an apartment (water leaking, I believe) and finding every room loaded with boxes of cash.  In a society with a lively parallel economy, there must be a means to turn cash into anything else, and if possible, get it out of the country.  Bitcoin to the rescue!

Just did the same thing...gotta say, joining virwox is about the geekiest thing I've ever done.
