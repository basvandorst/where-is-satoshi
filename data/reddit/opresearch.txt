I have tried,  i am chalking them up to a loss at least for the moment because there are others that are experiencing the same thing. I assume it has something to do with monitoring and controlling btc exchange

yeah, i have responded to many.   maybe because im new to this and first xfer may have been to a market wallet?  would that affect it?  im learning so please dont knock my ignorance too hard.

they have emailed me and said i will have more information by the end of the next business day. which will be monday morning.  i think either it was something about it being a weekend or possibly because i tried to send it to a market wallet directly (i know im facepalming as we speak)  but these are the only factors that i can see because i have followed all instructions thoroughly. I will keep this post updated with more info i am given because it all has a "tracking" type vibe.....

i just opened yesterday,  They gladly accepted my money, then have denied every attempt to send or do anything but charge fees for attempting to send and changing usd to btc

They are doing kinda the same thing to me today as well i have been attempting to send money out from an account i just created,   maybe its just their systems?   you have to enter the text code though to send it please try again if you wait to long they prompt you to try again.
