Watch your gdax transaction log. When it says “verified” then your ledger should show the funds. If it says “pending” or “awaiting confirmations” then the transaction hasn’t finished yet.

Have you checked both your Segwit and legacy wallets on the ledger? You may have sent it to one or the other from gdax and then looked at the wrong one on the ledger.

If it’s only been 15 minutes then the transactions probably won’t show up on your ledger for quite a while. Bitcoin transactions can take hours depending upon the block and backlog. If it doesn’t show up by tomorrow, then there may be an issue.

I didn’t see the episode but got the synopsis. In the long term it might be neutral and it definitely won’t affect current trading. However, it seems to me that while it does show the realities of losing the coins forever, this show will be the first glimpse of what bitcoin is for an audience of millions of people. While you hear about bitcoin in the news, it goes in one ear and out the other like stocks for the average person. This episode sounds like a lot of FUD which will scare off a lot of newcomers who were right on the fence.

In the chrome app, go to settings and switch to the legacy wallet. Verify that you didn’t use that wallet instead of segwit. If it’s not there, it may require more time to show in your segwit wallet depending upon how long ago you performed the transaction.

Owning shares in a company usually provides voting rights and other benefits. If dividends are paid out, then your voting rights do not change with an increase in company profits. If the company requires you to sell a portion of your share(s) to generate a profit equivalent to a dividend, then you are losing the power of the original share (I.e. percentage of ownership). Your argument therefore does not make a fair comparison in my opinion.

I made an account about two months ago. Made several successful credit card transactions. Decided to add a bank account. Received and entered the test deposits for verification and bam!, my entire account is restricted from any purchases. I contacted them a month ago and didn’t receive any response despite updating the ticket several times. Submitted a new ticket two weeks ago and they told me the original ticket would be expedited and I should get a response in 4-5 business days. It’s now been 7 business days and no response...
