There should be a weekly beginner thread

It does beg the question -- does this put the anonymity of the others at risk? If I am getting paid a salary from a non-profit -- will they be able to track down my wallet?

Remember, even though that 1-2% fee isn't paid to transact, it is still paid to exchanges to get FIAT, or paid to someone like bitpay. While the charge isn't there at the point of sale, it still exists.

Ghash could have 51% if they wanted and noone would know. They could have a second pool in the backend, and everytime people freak out, they just move 10-15% of their hash power over there. People stop freaking out, the miners will have no idea as they are still getting coins from Ghash.

I don't think what i'm referring to exists fully yet, but that the protocol would allow for something like this to exist. As someone else mentioned -- even a customer ID would be more than enough to use in conjunction with a 3rd party.

Damn -- what's the situation now? I was selling some gridseeds for sha/scrypt and in a week they perma-banned no reason -- paypal reinstated account -- but eBay even with an attorney they claim they cannot reveal the information which is BS.
Few hundred sales on the account 99/100% positive feedback with around 400 positive comments. 
@_date: 2014-04-27 19:23:43
I wonder if there's a way to make IDs that could have the same function? Disable your old ID, wipe the information from it, and just print out a new ID.

However, if they take more than the amount they're supposed to, your bank will return the money to you along with pulling it out of their account. If they resist, state and federal law will be used to punish them.  
With Bitcoin, it's anonymous. If your private key is given up, there is no way to track or trace or return your money. 
I'm a big fan of Bitcoin, but it isn't some form of holy grail. It has its benefits and drawbacks just like FIAT does.
@_date: 2014-03-05 19:35:40
That's the kicker - if it goes to the charity no matter what - what's the pressure on the companies? It will be juiciest at around 2 months once the pool has been collecting, the press headlines will read "Will fortune100 X move forward, or will these people have to wait one more week before they receive their charity?!"
Or will the headline read "$X has been building up for 2(4/6/12) months, which company will move forward to release these funds to charitable means?
I wouldn't call it an allegation, I'm not claiming you guys are a scam because I have no idea who you guys are, I'm just saying when it's online you can never be too careful 
@_date: 2014-07-27 21:41:12
I'm a big time fan of BTC and I'm seeing huge pushes for "MORE MERCHANT ADOPTION!" but I think the big problem now is that a lot of BTC holders/merchants aren't even using BTC for their transactions. 
Hopefully we can get some good results and see where our community weakpoint is so we can focus our efforts.
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:16:46
Please someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe an MtGox situation would never happen. They wouldn't be allowed to just one day not allow withdrawals. Yeah, you can still lose money if the price goes down, but you always have the option to accept your losses and get out.
@_date: 2014-07-27 00:08:01
TBH I haven't seen many people actually scan QR codes. 
@_date: 2014-08-17 23:40:27
It would be optional. For example, a person would want their financial privacy. However, a non-profit organization would want public to prove that they are using their funds how they said they would be. Since it is an organization, even if there is a large amount, it would not be known who the key holder is so it isn't as risky.
@_date: 2014-07-20 19:21:53
They prey on people looking to get into bitcoin, since the whole community knows to stay away from them. 
They took people's money, plugged in their own equipment and mined, as the months passed the difficulty went higher, and the equipment became obsolete. Once it was obsolete -- the equipment was "finally ready for delivery" and shipped out. Not longer after the electricity to keep it running cost more than the unit -- unless bitcoin goes to $9000. 
@_date: 2014-07-27 21:51:15
I think we need to focus on some community perks such as BITCOIN DAY -- the one day a year where everyone goes out and does everything with bitcoin only. Then put together a nice statistic sheet of "X bitcoin $XXXXXX was spent on bitcoin day -- merchants will start trying to bank in on this and it will expose regular patrons of those businesses to not just a transaction (oh the guy in front of me in line paid with bitcoin) but to the community (a group of people coming in hanging out chatting welcoming others to join them and explain it, wear BTC shirts all that jazz).
@_date: 2014-03-30 22:37:14
Edit: There IS a weekly beginner thread.
@_date: 2014-08-01 02:36:16
I was lookin at it pre-orders closed though :/
@_date: 2014-05-02 23:21:43
I've been looking for a "Bitcoin accepted here" sticker for my business forever. As well as "Litecoin accepted here."
@_date: 2014-07-27 21:30:19
It also can go down in value -- but that's despite the point. I think that's a large part of who the BTC community is today and we should be focusing on them(us) since it is still new and unpredictable. I believe our focus now should be converting FIAT transaction volume --&gt; BTC transaction volume from current BTC holders. 
@_date: 2014-07-26 19:48:43
I'm a big fan of cryptos but I wouldn't put that much effort towards introducing bitcoin to my customers. Why? Because I'm not a learning center. Yes, it would be good for BTC, but it wouldn't be good for my business since I'm not gaining any benefit.
I will put up a one-sheet explaining basic FAQ of bitcoin near payment center with a link to a "bitcoin getting started DOs and DONTs". 
@_date: 2014-03-05 18:44:34
But in 3 months time the funds will end up just going to the nonprofit -- so there is no pressure, there is no stakes, there is nothing for the big companies to lose. By the time they finish discussing the logistics of adaptation the money would have already gotten donated.
I love the idea, but unless it's like a lottery where it pools up and CANNOT get released there is no reason for anyone to join in. 
Also -- the non-profit is pretty vague. Name of organization? What've they done in the past? If they're new...what's their credibility? What's their plan? Who's their partners? The team?
Right now, I'm just assuming its a scam(Send money, and in 3 months it will go to "some nonprofit for WATER"). Sharpen up the idea, and you got something good that many would give money to.
@_date: 2014-01-28 18:13:40
oof. That's a bitch. I've always had funds returned to me despite the situation.
@_date: 2014-01-03 19:05:46
For other businesses also, though. What if they click notify order ready, and then one person comes up, shows the image, picks up the drink, hands off the phone to friend, and then friend comes up to pick up 'his' drink?
Things are so fast paced, the bartender has no proof it was picked up, and it will just be easier to give out a free drink than to argue with the guy.  
One thing is a notification, another is marking as redeemed. I am looking to use this in my business and this is a crucial aspect.
@_date: 2014-02-26 03:34:07
Those large institutions are what will make the currency appealing for the mass. Maybe they're shit, but it's the best we got. If we want to see BTC accepted in every store this is the move required.
 If you don't want to go to them, hey, bitcoin will always have an unregulated factor to it and you can buy/trade/etc. the same way you have always been. 
@_date: 2014-05-19 18:43:42
They wouldn't buy all bitcoins, but they could deffinitely manipulate the market however they wish with huge sell orders, targeting the people behind exchanges, targeting ASIC companies, miners, etc. etc.  if they really wanted to it would be an easy war. As you said it is  insubstantial, yet everyday there are posts about how Bitcoin is under attack by the Govt.
@_date: 2014-08-17 23:40:33
Awesome stuff thank you!
@_date: 2014-01-28 18:07:24
Not really something someone opts-in for. Also, they wouldn't know their key is compromised until it is too late and their account is drained. It's not for everyone, though personally I'm happy to have the ability to have full control of my money
@_date: 2014-05-05 18:57:21
Possibly building a POS(point-of-sale) type wallet that uses a standard format for customers and business. When sending a transaction, the user will be able to send a message along into the blockchain that will have a format easy for merchants/customers to co-ordinate(SKU # - QTY - CONTACT). So an example transaction would be something like:
**14358A, 1502B - 3,1 - 1234 Reddit Avenue 1-555-555-5555**
14358 would be the product, A would be standard shipping, and I am including payment for 3 of these. 1502 is another item I want, B is express shipping, and I have included payment for 1.

Never heard of shared send.
@_date: 2014-01-28 18:14:03
Someone like you who knows it, by all means it is better. 
@_date: 2014-08-02 16:37:28
Thank you!

Remember, Bitcoin requires an internet access which may not be accessible for many people. 
@_date: 2014-07-27 22:56:57
That was the point of this and was mentioned in another thread that inspired this. Maybe the goal right now is to convert the many people in the bitcoin community already to always having a "spending wallet" that they regularly refill everytime they use it. I know a lot about cryptos, I love them, but the truth is as much as I trade them, I don't actually use them =/
@_date: 2014-08-18 06:57:34
Inflated intracompany sales are just as risky. You are right, there is a lot that it won't cover, but there are some basics that it would help.
One of my favorite examples is this: You have been sent a bill for $x. You attempt to pay said bill, but being forced through loops, lost in the mail, no contact point, etc. You receive a second bill with $XX penalty fees. Few months later, you receive a collections notice. Since these are push-payments, you can just send the $x and continue with your life, and if they come back, you have a full receipt with time stamp. 
 For example, I'm a non-profit, and I want to prove that i need X funds to purchase Y. I will make a public address, and as soon as the account hits X, I will have a proof of transaction towards Y. 
Another example is "X proceeds of this product will go towards charity". Ok, if I see transaction from Public Wallet of Z, to public wallet of Y -- I know they really did give my proceeds.
@_date: 2014-01-03 09:12:04
I think the bartender would need a way to MARK AS CLAIMED. 
@_date: 2014-07-27 20:42:36
It's the same reason when you go to target or macys, cvs etc. or any other store you don't buy giftcards and store money on them despite the fact you'll use it eventually. Because you already have your money stored in a secure spot, its easy, and its widely accepted(CC). The benefits of bitcoin are NOT for everyone and security risks are much higher unless the person is tech-savvy. 
@_date: 2014-07-27 19:33:48
The additional service is accepting Bitcoin. It's a huge learning curve for most merchants to use -- specially if they are not tech savvy. Also, the same way you have to keep reserve for chargebacks, you have to keep reserve for price fluctuations. 
@_date: 2014-05-05 19:27:52
There've been messages put into the blockchain before
@_date: 2014-01-28 17:51:30
This already exists...it is up to you to decide where you keep your money, but FIAT doesn't magically become irrelevant just because the magical internets money exists now
@_date: 2014-01-28 00:59:08
Ah, understood. Is there anywhere I could read up more on this?
@_date: 2014-05-04 04:46:00
I need a big one for my front window
@_date: 2014-07-27 03:49:05
That works. I'm actually looking for a good one-sheet now to put up in my store
@_date: 2014-04-05 17:50:30
The highest fee is stolen coins.
@_date: 2014-07-27 19:58:18


I'm a merchant and I would never do this. I would offer a discount to pull in BTC users to use their BTC at my store -- but what's the point of trying to convert customers who are paying cash/card to using BTC unless it offers me or them a substantial benefit.
@_date: 2014-07-27 23:15:39
I wrote it corny, but you get the idea. I don't know I'd deffinitely put my store as a part of it. It could even be a company that puts together "BTC only events" -- I would deff. give a discount for bringing a guaranteed group of X people into my place. Everybody wins. There could even be a competition between merchants for making the most social media noise( X people posted on instagram / twitter with   ). 
@_date: 2014-07-28 22:40:48
Mmm, tbh knowledge. I get overly paranoid of losing my wallet / corrupting my wallet / having my wallet tampered with etc. and haven't really dug into the process of properly keeping a wallet. I know you can use paper wallets or something like blockchain -- but I just haven't gotten over that stump. Once I have a quick easy accessible wallet I will be looking out for when I can use BTC to use.
@_date: 2014-02-18 03:10:13
Bitcoin is still new and still plenty of un-scouted territory. ATM, you are correct, its a huge fucking risk and not practical for day-to-day usage. Right now it's moreso about a community paving the path for a new frontier and working out all the bugs so that we can have full functionality of it in the future
@_date: 2014-03-28 20:54:40
They're investing in Bitcoin startups -- price is irrelevent to them, though higher prices is a nice perk. Think of Bitpay--despite the price of bitcoin, they get 1%? of the transaction fee. 1% of $10 in BTC is the same whether BTC = $10,000 or $1.
@_date: 2013-12-23 12:47:32
It's the equivalent of your boss coming up to you and asking if you'd like to be paid in gold or silver. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 01:33:45
What he's saying is that they give the CPU extra work, so instead of it only processing the key, it will be processing the key + xyz algorithm. So unless they know the algorithm, the frequencies they capture from the CPU will just be gibberish.
