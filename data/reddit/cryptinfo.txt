Thanks for the info, will be reading the guides over the next couple days.  
  
One more question:  
Day trading requires lots of sell/buy orders, any method you've learnt to avoid/diminish exchange fees?  
  
Those would rapidly accumulate into a large chunk of your earnings.

I don't understand why people don't get that.  If your BTC amount is increasing you're making profit and successfully day trading.  
  
Any tips for a newbie?  
Thoughts on MACD and its use in Crypto?

Treat it like gold:  
"Gold should be an important part of a diversified investment portfolio because its price increases in response to events that cause the value of paper investments, such as stocks and bonds, to decline. Although the price of gold can be volatile in the short term, it has always maintained its value over the long term. "  
Bitcoin is like gold's younger brother, who happens to fluctuate way more wildly.  
Bitcoin itself will probably not be used for day to day purchases like buying groceries or a t-shirt. Transactions are slow and honestly not that great, but the overall value has consistently proven to grow.  
  
Anyways, I could go on for hours, but I'm not trying to preach anyone into an uncomfortable investment decision.  
  
DM me any questions, I would love to introduce anyone to the wonders of blockchain and decentralized banking.   
  
TLDR;  Bitcoin is the internet's gold investment.  You wouldn't buy groceries with a gold bar.
