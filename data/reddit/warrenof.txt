It will be interesting when all the Christmas bills start rolling in and "ordinary folks" who joined late have to decide whether to pay off their "real" bills or hodl.
I think the big deciding factor will be the institutional money. But would fear for a mid/late Jan dip that turns into a run as small leavers turn into a big correction.

I guess it depends on how much you trust the graph/model and the timescales its spread over. Is the start 1 day and the 100? Does the model have enough detail to mean anything?
Personally I agree with the principles listed. But I see the whole thing being microcosms in each vertical if the BTC market.
BTC price has been driven up by something. My read is new investors fuelling speculation as media reports big gains. Not everyone can win in the speculative market that's created, unless the utility value beats the speculation in a meaningful timescale.
Once there's a break down in short term gains, IMHO a big chunk of the speculators will leave. My guess is that outside pressures removing new investors, like seasonal bills, will trigger this. Whether that spook's the whole market or not, I'm not sure.
Personally I'm holding a lot of USD now and much less BTC. If there's a bear, I plan to buy as close to bottom as possible and wait for the next round. If I'm wrong, I already locked in some gains for the short term and I hold enough to have the utility value for the long.
