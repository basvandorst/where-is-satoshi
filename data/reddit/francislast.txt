And yet the central message in the piece -that the coming digital currency conflagration will leave its scars for generations- is so indubitably spot-on. Only a fool would seek to save in the form of bitcoin/digital currency unit. No-one will! Watch!

Ohh, dear.. what a deeply wounding, not to say beautifully pithy,  example of the wit inherent in sarcasm. Have you been reading Wilde recently?... you must be getting inspiration from somewhere. 
Aside from the small matter that 'reading COMPREHENSION' would not be the salient issue here, I think the most revealing aspect here is the blind and pitiful arrogance of Bakedbeans, who -delighted with the creative genius of his idiotic and infantile moniker- seems immune to the notion that anyone might mock his pretentiousness. I don't think I'll be alone in this view of Bumbangerbaby.

Gee, I guess in a self-deluding poet genius/smartass world of the "revilution" (pathetic, less than half-witted) type, it is unlikely one would see the Shitcoin reference in anything other than such pompous terms. However, since (happily) few inhabit such an emotionally lumpen world, most would read the author's title as an expression of his strength of feeling about the blatantly obvious Ponzi bitcoin fraud. It'll lead to tears, you know!

Bakedbeans...it's you who suck, you first class ignoramus. It's you who has no understanding of federal and personal debt. It's you who fails to see the process by which the system is to be re-set. The article is neither uneducated nor misleading, but your narrative is both. You been advising Cypriot savers recently?
