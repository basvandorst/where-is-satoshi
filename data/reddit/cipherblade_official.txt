"Seems like Bitcoin already peaked, all downhill or relatively stable from here"
Response: Yes, Bitcoin is just a way to speculate on an asset  that could go in any direction for any reason; no point in you buying it.

Indeed it's not meant to act as a medium of exchange for most goods &amp; services. Lightning can do that, but Bitcoin itself not so ideal. Bitcoin is really about having censorship-resistant money that acts as an effective store of value

Yes, that's precisely what you should do. It is rather unreasonable though since laws effectively force you to sell

This answer is correct. Mining is needs to be done at scale to be profitable, especially with Bitcoin. Even large mining operations with a considerable amount of miners are not always efficient enough to be profitable, and they have far greater economies of scale then you do in terms of hashrate relative to power consumption + much lower electricity costs. Here's the latest mining operation to bite the dust  . Simply put, you won't achieve the economies of scale or efficiencies necessary to be profitable with a single rig mining Bitcoin, even if you have the most efficient mining rig out there.

Hate to break it to you but Bitcoin isn't anonymous. Far from it. Look up what we do.

To anyone else thinking of doing the same, I would say be careful. I don't know what country OP resides him, but generally speaking, when you do work / earn income, you are taxed on that income regardless of *how* you earn that income.  It doesn't matter whether that income is earned in the fiat currency of your own country, fiat currency of another country, cryptocurrency, gold, DVDs or chocolate bars. In most countries you're required to report the *fair market value* of what you earned when you earn it. And that gets taxed. Yet, your government is only going to accept your local fiat currency which puts you in a position of either being forced to sell or having to use your savings to pay tax (or you could just not report it - illegal, but no doubt some people do just that, often with consequences).
Now if the price of BTC has gone up in value you're in luck, because whenever it comes time to paying tax the following year, you can liquidate only what you need to pay that tax. But it's also important to recognize that the price of BTC could go down. Let's say the you have a 40% tax rate and the Bitcoin declined 70% in price. The value of the $6560 of Btc would now only be $1968, however, you'd owe even more than that, $2624, in taxes! That would put you in quite a bad situation - owing more in taxes than you have despite not selling the BTC! Even if you sold 100% of it at this point, you'd still be underwater.
I agree the scenario I mentioned is unreasonable from a policy perspective, but frankly that's the way the laws are in *most* countries. OPs country may be an exception.
