I met the guy behind this -- cool guy, cool product. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:30:03
any idea who it was?

Thanks! I'll be posting it here for sure. I'll look into the wiki/Research later, any idea where/if I could get data on silk road sales(estimates)?

I actually ran a regression analysis measuring a few factors for bitcoin prices; tested the SR traffic as one and it wasn't a significant influence on the price. This fluctuation must be in fear and I assume in one week it will rise back to a place near where it was before the closure of SR.

any help for doing this. It looks like I might be meeting up with  . I've never owned bitcoins before. Anything to watch out for?

It was a great time meeting a fellow bitcoiner! He is a friendly fellow and bitcoin enthusiast. Couldn't have asked for a nicer person to introduce me to my first bitcoin. 
He even let me purchase this without paying him at the time because the transfer had not gone through yet.
That is the kind of gesture that makes me not only happy for humanity but for the bitcoin community. 
Thanks Lalicat!
EDIT: paid

That article is ridiculous btw. Feel free to show that author some love. 
If the winning solution has something to do with bitcoin, it could give some leverage with the way Canada's legislation is currently treating bitcoins.

I'm from toronto, can I visit you?

To estimate I did multiplied 50 bitcoins per 10 minutes by 6 (to get 300 an hour) and by 24 (to get 7200) a day. These numbers didn't fit this chart... 
fyi - I do know that in Jan 2013, it changed to only 25 bitcoins every 10 minutes.

I know this guy personally. Really cool dude. Really cool products. I may or may not have been an influence to get him accepting bitcoin :)

Any chance you could lead me to the source of the data, I'm writing a research paper on bitcoin.

Even if I could get the start date when bitcoin started to be exchanged, I could work backwards from there

He sold me some bit coins yesterday. Very nice guy.
