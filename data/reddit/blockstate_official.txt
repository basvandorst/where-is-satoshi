It is important to have an active Reddit community.  The more users we have, the more ideas can be exchanged and thus the more benefit for the community as a whole.

People are looking into the direction of SEC and ETFs to trigger a bull run, and although ETFs are currently a hot topic in crypto. Creation of next generation financial products is the way to go, we focus on creating technology for more cost-effective, transparent and accessible financial ecosystem for all participants, projects focusing on overall adoption in finance and other sectors will be behind the actual rise in price and full adoption.
