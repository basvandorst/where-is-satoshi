The article said the trust is for accredited investors.  That means that you're registered with the SEC and can prove your net worth is over a million dollars, you make 200,000 a year or more for the foreseeable future or are a corporate officer or some combination of the previous.  So yeah you're right.

OK Mr. Rogoff, explain how this keeps Apple and Google from dodging taxes.

I'm envious.  I live in Makati City, Philippines and all we have is one bitcoin ATM.

In Canada the girls would need QR code tattoos at the end of their act.  I know this because I used to work in Buffalo and  go to those bars at lunch time.  =)

Good job.  Rookie traders would have bought at $270 and sold at $232.

"Be greedy when others are fearful"
When discussing financial markets that's historically absolutely correct but most people can't do it.  I think I'm going to wait to get in until the fork starts working and people start to see that the sky isn't falling.

The Wells Fargo express send features allows the daily transfer of up to $5000 for a flat fee of $4.
My Schwab Bank debit card allows withdrawals from a foreign ATM and refunds the ATM fee I get charged overseas. Their exchange rate is very good so this is the closest I can get to a free transfer.
I'm an American living in Makati (part of Manila) six months out of the year.  There is a bitcoin ATM near where live.  Unfortunately I don't use Bitcoin for transfers because it just isn't the cheapest.  Coins.ph has some pretty good services though.

i saw an article in Bitcoin Magazine that said the start date is September 4.

Here's a link to the NYT article: 
"Federal banking regulators said the practices, which date back to 2011, reflected serious flaws in the internal culture and oversight at Wells Fargo, one of the nation’s largest banks. The bank has fired at least 5,300 employees who were involved."
"Wells Fargo employees opened roughly 1.5 million bank accounts and applied for 565,000 credit cards that may not have been authorized by customers"
I guess the worst thing about this is that no criminal charges against the management were mentioned.

Absolutely nothing.  Mr Stiglitz has not done his homework and has conflated bitcoin with Silk Road.
@_date: 2016-09-10 04:37:45
The author seems to garble the differences between blockchain technology, Bitcoin, and etherium as well as ignore the ETH / ETC split.  Really not the sort of article I'd pay much attention to.

The deal is that is probably the cheapest way to do it.  Note that almost all ATMs in the Philippines charge a 200 peso fee for foreign ATM cards.  Don't go around making 500 pesos withdrawals or you'll lose your money faster than you would with those services.  HSBC is the only bank I know of there that does not charge a fee so try to find one near you.
What I did was open a Schwab checking account.  They refund foreign ATM fees once a month and the exchange rate is good.

I'm heading to Makati myself next week.  There's a bitcoin atm on Durban near Makati Ave.  Take a look at coins.ph and quione exchange.

I reread the article and you're correct.  I still think he needed to differentiate Bitcoin and Etherium by name.

Have you been in IT long enough to notice that every few years the media including the NYT runs stories predicting that developers are about to become obsolete and the profession will no longer be needed ?  Correctable ledger and related topics will probably wind up the same way.  And I've been reading those programmers are about to be obsolete stories since the 1970s.

The IRS only needs to know where your bank accounts live.  Someone I know found this out the hard way. Actually the state of California is much worse than the IRS in this regard.
@_date: 2015-09-28 20:36:03
Hadn't heard about that one.  What I do know about is FBAR and FATCA because I live outside the US about half the year.  I have a bank account in the Philippines for monthly expenses and if the balance is over $10,000 on any given day I have to report it to the US Treasury the next year or get a hefty fine. My tax adviser told me one of his clients was just fined $60,000 for not reporting. My point is that if the IRS can track my foreign accounts knowing what accounts you have in the US probably isn't difficult for them unless you give a wrong social security number, which I would advise against.

That's the idea. A reason a person would want to do this is to hold (indirectly) Bitcoin in their retirement plan accounts.

Probably after the national security establishment in Great Britain started making noise about making bitcoin illegal because it's used by terrorists like encryption.
Also bitcoin itself was started by a group of people with a major interest in encryption, and uses encrytion to function.

She could still use Girls Gone Bitcoin but probably that's not the Bitcoin future Carl had in mind.  I hope.

Another thing they've been very quiet about is metadata. (Who is talking to who and when.) I've read a lot of security articles claiming the metadata is at least as important as the actual contents of the messages.
