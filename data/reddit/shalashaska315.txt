People already have had their money stolen. Your money can be stolen if it's in a bank too, see Greece. People lost money with MtGox too, it could happen again, don't just assume it can't. The point of bitcoin is that trust is not needed.

I mean, if you just want it off cb, you can just send it to another non-cb address. Theoretically, you could send it to another online wallet.
I would argue that if you have a large amount of BTC (large meaning it would cause you great anguish if you lost it) I would look into create an offline wallet and sending some there.

Because everyone who uses the term "bcash" *is* against the BCH fork. This is completely obvious to everyone. It's not *necessarily* the case that using "bcash" means you have an agenda, but practically speaking I haven't see anyone use it that isn't against the BCH fork. It's a heuristic.

No problem, you didn't notice it was someone else.
I generally agree, although I do find the "brute force" part to be tricky. Yes, I agree that scaling 100% on chain is unlikely to work. But I don't necessarily agree that we shouldn't do any on chain scaling. I think there's a balance there (between keeping it distributed, but also keeping the throughput at a good rate), because ultimately the block size is arbitrary. And yes, I understand the argument that "increasing the block size at all if ceding the principle (because it can justify further increases) and must be fought."
Frankly, I'm just not sold on the L2 applications/solutions. Many of them seem half-baked to me. I want to see some real world testing of these solutions before I'd call myself an L2 believer. Also, I find it slightly hypocritical that many will argue that "we don't want to mess with L1", but L1 has already been messed with, with SegWit. Now, I'm not saying that SegWit is necessarily bad, but it seems to be very subjective what is considered "messing with L1" and what isn't considered "messing with L1."
I agree with your last sentence as well.

Ok, here's my transaction 
Was trying to transact with Newegg, after not going through for an hour, they encouraged me to use my credit card. Then it finally did go through hours later. It's not 24 hours, but still, it's a long freakin time.

I'm a different guy who jumped into the convo. Just wanted to add my two cents.
EDIT: I didn't claim it was 24 hours. I realize you didn't see my name though. Still, I find it very frustrating that people basically pretend that these problems don't exist. 6 hours is still ridiculously long. It's not like that's significantly better. I would still consider that very long.

This is the problem I have with people who resist changing the size. The story immediately becomes a slippery slope where one day we increase to 2mb and then somehow, weeks later, we're at 1tb blocks. If the network *can* sustain an increase in block size, why not increase it? That seems to be the better question. If it can't, it can't and it shouldn't be increased.
Merchants have been leaving the bitcoin economy due to high tx fees and long confirmation times. It's not the end of the world, but it's not nothing either. It's a big deal, that trust in cryptos is probably going to take a lot of work to re-establish. Resisting any block size increases, even increases that only shut out the very smallest miners, is a bad idea in my opinion.

It's not political in and of itself. It's just that it happens to be used almost exclusively by people who are against the BCH fork. It's like if someone calls Trump "*Our* president", that's not strictly a charged statement. It's a factual one. But it's a phrase that's used almost exclusively by Trump supporters.

It's better than nothing, and it's better than Segwit. If more advanced solutions become usable and are proven (in the real world) to work, then use them too. The only argument made against 2mb is that it's a slippery slope and I think that argument is very tenuous.

[2-factor authentication is a term generally refers to authenticating against a piece of knowledge and a possession.]( Practically speaking in the real world, 99% of the time it means that to do something, you need a password AND your phone, rather than ONLY a password. It makes things significantly more difficult for hackers.
Most online bitcoin services have 2-factor built in, so it's not like it'll be hard to find, but it's just something to keep in mind.
@_date: 2016-12-25 00:59:46
What I was saying mostly refers to wallets on a websites. Phone apps are typically a bit different. It says on their FAQ that they have you create a 12 word phrase during set up. Theoretically, this phrase should have been created on your phone, never sent to their side, and only an encrypted version of this phrase sent to their side. It's essentially a second password. So strictly speaking it's not 2-factor, but 2-factor isn't super common with phone apps, at least not right now. The main reason for this is that it's much harder for malware to force it's way onto a phone vs onto a pc, since phone operating systems are more locked down. On a pc, installing software is easy and software can theoretically gain access to any files you have. On a phone, individual apps are relegated to their own separate file areas. Sorry if this makes things more confusing.
@_date: 2016-12-25 18:37:44
You don't need to necessarily dedicate a piece of hardware just for an offline wallet. A common method (and one I used) is to put a fresh installation of Ubuntu on a CD or USB. Also on the USB you can have software for generating a bitcoin address. You can even disconnect your pc from the wall temporarily, just to be safe. Then you can boot up, create the wallet, then print it out, write down the keys, or do something else to store it. At that point you'll have the private and public key. The machine was never online, so it's effectively an offline wallet. You can then start sending money to your public key.
Like I said, think of it like a savings account. If you ever need to get that money out, it would be best to get another fresh install of Ubuntu, then rather then create a wallet, you can connect that machine to the Internet and use a bitcoin program to send money from your private key that was previously offline. Another step you can take is before you go to withdraw from your cold storage, you can create a second offline wallet. Then when you are ready to withdraw from cold wallet 1, send all the money you don't withdraw into cold wallet 2.
If it sounds like a lot of work, it kind of is. But again, think savings account. This would be your permanent storage area for any bitcoin saved, so taking a few extra steps to withdraw is worth it.
@_date: 2016-12-25 14:48:08
Well, just known that work done through an app on Android or iOS is going to be more secure than through a Web browser with ONLY a password. On the Web browser side, once 2-factor is introduced, they become comporable, security-wise. A trezor would be even more secure than both, but you should feel fine using phone app wallets.
Just to clear things up, a Trezor is not offline. And offline wallet, sometimes called "cold storage," means that the private keys were created on a machine that is completely offline. Those wallets are basically "receive-only" since they're offline. Think of it like a savings account. To actually take money out, you'd need to bring that wallet online, by connecting the machine to the internet.
A Trezor falls into the category of a "hardware wallet." The device itself is still connected to the Internet (you can send/receive bitcoins from it after all), but the OS of the device is written from the ground up to be secure for bitcoin.
Since you're just starting out, don't sweat too much about offline wallets. If you get to the point where you'd be extremely upset if you accidently lost your coins, that's when you might want to consider migrating some coins to an offline wallet.
@_date: 2016-12-24 23:55:26
Don't get sucked in by sudden spikes upward in the price and think "oh shit, I need to buy before it's too late!" It goes without saying, but make sure 2-factor authentication is enabled for anything and everything you do online.

This is the part I don't get. Can anyone give a reasonable argument as to why the 1mb size ISN'T totally arbitrary? And why not at least touch upon Moore's law? Look at the size of game installs 10 years ago vs now.
If you truly believe that the main chain can't scale fast enough, then say that. But to me, holding on to 1mb just seems arbitrary. It seems like he's just glossing over the fact that things like bandwidth, storage space, and computing power are ever increasing. Why not at least have a graph of the estimated growth of bitcoin vs the estimated increase in bandwidth, storage, and comp power, or just discuss the idea?
And at the end, he's talking about how we don't want to sacrifice security or privacy. Ok, agreed. But what does that *necessarily* have to do with scaling? It seems like he's implying that trying to scale on the primary chain will result in decreased security and/or privacy. He doesn't say it out right, but it seems like he's implying it.

Right. I guess I'm looking to become slightly more usable while maintaining security (as much as possible). I'm probably going to end up leaving most in cold/paper and putting some into a hardware wallet, but I was looking to see what options people used who DIDN'T use paper, or only paper. Sounds like the nano S and Trezor are most popular so far.
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:48:21
The point is that storage space gets cheaper and cheaper over time. You don't have to go that far back in time when people would have said "terabyte drives are huge and no one will ever need that." The same will happen with petabyte drives, and further on from there. Then question is *when*, not if it will happen. Andreas seems like he was just throwing out big quantities to make it seem like this is an impossible task. As I said, the main comparison is the estimated rate of storage increase vs the estimated rate of storage needed. I would like to see more discussion of that, he seemed to gloss over it.

True. I'm confident a solution will be found for the DDOS problem, but in the chance that it's not, the sooner an alternative to Bitcoin crops up the better.

They want people to tell them that they are correct.
@_date: 2016-02-13 06:02:46
That's true. Scalability is not a problem for all uses. I'm sure you'd agree, but Bitcoin doesn't *have* to be an anything and everything currency to be a "success" (however you define that), I just think most people would like it to be that and are working towards that end.
@_date: 2016-02-12 22:38:57
I mean, it could potentially get to that point. Then it would be a problem. It's not really a problem right now, it's a future problem, assuming Bitcoin spreads further.
@_date: 2016-02-12 17:52:27
Scalability is definitely an issue. Also I think usability and his "recourse" point tie together. Right now, it's fairly difficult for the average person to easily join and fairly easy for that person to make a huge mistake. Those are problems that need more work done for bitcoin to further expand. It's possible recourse (as it exists with credit card companies) might never exist, so making it easy for the least technical users to be secure is a challenge that must be met.
His problem on the size of the blockchain is kind of odd. That's only really an issue if you are running a node (which many people *should* be doing, I don't want to downplay that). Plus, it's a one time download. I think it's a minor inconvenience for some people that will most likely get better as time goes on.

@_date: 2015-10-09 23:01:55
While I agree, it's not entirely certain what would happen in something drastic happens. Say we double dip into a recession, as some people think might happen. It's entirely possible that bitcoin could take a hit there. I personally think it's here to stay, but it *could* happen. Nothing is in stone.

I started with BitInstant. I had a few problems, some not their fault though. Then I moved to Coinbase; it's been smooth sailing from there on.
@_date: 2013-11-13 16:24:02
If you already understand Bitcoin yeah. If you don't get it, then you might be skeptical and just assume its a scam/ponzi scheme. It's not a bad question.

The theory behind having another installation is to curb the potential of malware. The longer you use a PC, the more likely it has been infected by something. It's just natural from using the internet nowadays. The more people use bitcoins, the more likely that malware is going to be snooping for your wallet.
I'm going to leave my cold storage alone. If I really need to send from it, I'll just do another clean Ubuntu install before I connect. It just seems safer that way.
@_date: 2013-11-12 16:07:37
This is correct. Doesn't make it bad, but it's not as big as it might sound.

This is a bit misleading. People still back the dollar. That's why it has value, not because of who makes it. If the dollar ever dies, it'll be because the people no longer value it, not because some third party like the Pentagon no longer backs it.

You'll still want to verify that the customer is actually sending the funds. You may want a bitcoin app on your phone so that you can watch the balance of the address on your QR code. Or ask to see your customer's phone screen when they press the send button.
@_date: 2013-04-10 13:33:08
Eh, he sounded like he genuinely wanted to understand it. It's very understandable for people to think it's a scam at first sight. It still sounds a bit crazy, even to me. I thought most of the questions he asked were legit.
@_date: 2013-10-08 14:53:53
He seems more into complaining that actually trying to come up with an alternative. Although, I do think there's room for bitcoin to change things up.
I'm imagining a system with no monthly fees where you pay per listen. Roughly around 1 cent per listen. It could have diminishing revenue for songs as well. If I listen to a song 1000 times, paying $10 for that song might be extreme to some. Maybe the cost for songs halves per listen, or something like that. Individual artists can host their own music and add it to the catalog. There could be some kind of verification system for an artist to say "This is really me", as opposed to me personally uploading Radiohead and collecting money for listens.
People who want to support artists would do that, all while having the streaming model that they like now. The actual cost could be variable based on the artist. The costs overall would probably balance out over time so that customers aren't paying astronimical amounts for music, and artists get supported.

In my BlockChain wallet, I only store what's equivalent to the amount of fiat cash I would have on my person at any time. If I lose it, I'll be sad, but it won't be a disaster.

The username is also slightly different too. They guy could have two accounts just to measure the response from different subs, but it still seems pretty weird.
Edit: Maybe it is a scam. Only the address and username are different. The others, on and 4chan are all this other address and username.

I've had two transactions with them recently. The first took about 4 days to go through, which was really frustrating. However, they were helpful after I emailed them. The second went through fine.
I might try someone else I'm the future though, just to experiment. I've only bought from them and Coinbase.
@_date: 2013-11-11 16:38:59
I don't know why people still use it. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. Was the April debacle not enough to convince people to switch?

Just remember that cold storage is like a savings account. You get the most benefit by only depositing, and spending/withdrawing when you really need to. Spending means you have to go online and that's when you open yourself up.
It's also much more secure to do any withdrawal from a cold storage account from a fresh OS install. This helps ensure there is no malware running and that your limited time online will be as secure as possible.
I was setting up some wallets this weekend. With Ubuntu, it's super easy to create a fresh install on a USB stick.

You cash out by buying something else with your bitcoin that isn't likely to decrease in value. Find an exchange that accepts bitcoin and buy something, or just buy that something with bitcoin.

I still like Nielsio, but I don't understand why he is so adamant against bitcoin. Is it perfect? No, but it's a hell of a lot better than dollars or any other government controlled currency. It just seems like he pretends there are no advantages whatsoever to bitcoin over paper money. Also, I have no idea what he means when he says "you can't price things in bitcon." Why even breathe that sentence when it's so obviously wrong? People price things in bitcoin everyday.
@_date: 2013-11-11 19:34:25


I think by it's nature, Bitcoin undermines these, so it's up to you if you want to use it or help it expand.


Again, it's up to you. I'd would imagine a lot of socialist/communist types would be against it on principle. I don't care who you are though. I doubt anyone in the community does either. The more the merrier!

Well that too. I guess I mean barring any internal flaws. Most people who say it will fail cite economic reasons.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:58:07
Because money isn't everything? That's like asking "Why would anyone ever take money out of their savings account?" Saving is important, but spending is OK too. Currency only has value because it can purchase things. If you never purchase anything, then the money was worthless to you.

That's fine, but the post seems to imply that people only use dollars because they are forced too, which is only partially true. People also perceive value in dollars. That's what really gives the dollar its value, the perception of the public that is has value. That's the same reason that bitcoin has value as well.

Exactly. Saving is a great thing, you shouldn't spend money on crap you don't need. However, if you *are* going to spend money, why not spur on the bitcoin economy? The entire purpose of currency is to help facilitate transactions. You have to use it eventually for something, or else, what the heck do you have it for?

Hoarding, or just saving, is not a bad thing. It means people are simply going to consume in the future, rather than the present.
Also, people can't save forever; unless you're complete self-sufficient, we need to trade with each other in order to survive.

I used them about two weeks ago. It took about 5 days for my order to go through. They were friendly and did get me the proper amount of bitcoin that I paid for, but that's still pretty long when "instant" is in your name.

I know. It's just worth knowing that these are blogs, just like he said. I'm not trying to imply some deeper meaning beyond that.
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:25:48


That's a fair point.


All that's required is a stable price. I'm not saying it's gonna be easy; it's probably going to take a while to get there. But if enough people start using it, then small groups can't radically change the price. If we can get a relatively stable price, then a bitcoin will be worth a bitcoin over time, to use your phrase.
Again, I know it's easier said than done, but I would really like to see it succeed.

The first rule is don't invest more than you can afford to lose. I'm not saying I don't feel bad when people lose money, but that doesn't excuse rash decisions. If you invested an amount that, if lost, would break you, then you need to take a step back.
