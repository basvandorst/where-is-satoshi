Second helpings then?

So they're probably the smarter ones?

... He's actually right from a journalistic point-of-view.

Is there more history regarding the inventor other than that post? Is that literally the only thing people know about him?
What does his existence even signify? Is he supposed to be insanely wealthy at this point or something?

This is exactly what I was wondering about. If you're dealing with migrant residents- sure many of them may have access to a smartphone with apps or the internet in general, but for the business model to be significantly successful physical locations would be a necessity. 
Regarding third-world demand for bitcoin to facilitate remittances, how do current fiat currency exchanges fulfill their demand when it comes to converting let's say: US dollars to some third world currency with a very low global market value?

I see, but isn't there a distinct advantage of using bitcoin as a middle man to facilitate those conversions as apposed to say using fiat currency exchanges that are not only slower, but have additional fees tagged onto them by either a central bank within the country or other inflationary issues?
How would the problems we initially discussed arise in a system that looks like this:
US dollar --&gt; Converted to BTC --&gt; Converted to Philippine Pesos
This would be a system that similar to current remittance services would occur almost completely in the background. A fiat to BTC to fiat system to be exact.
What would hinder such a remittance model?

Fantastic video, and your blog post was insanely informing. Thanks!

In theory, couldn't the very same bitcoin-using remittance service just facilitate the cash pick up fr the recipient? Would rebit.ph be using secondary providers simply to get an initial footing in the industry?

The returns? We're talking more than a 1000% fluctuations in the span of a few months, why are you even comparing this to the S&amp;P?
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:15:14
Upvoted, but sometimes it's pretty obvious when you're at the lower end of a contraction. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:22:13
doesn't mention inflation at all, so what's with your quote?
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:18:30
Wasn't it around $350 a week ago?
@_date: 2013-11-23 06:23:36
So you don't believe that it'll go below $800?

What would have worked differently for you? Aside from starting your own hedgefund.
@_date: 2013-11-22 17:46:46
Fair enough, I agree wholeheartedly. But assuming the price does bottom out (which can only be observed in real time), what are we most likely looking at? ($150? $500?) 
Or is that an equally impossible question to answer as well? 
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:32:26
Where does he even mention inflation?
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:21:39
What in your eyes caused you to lose so significantly despite your accurate long term prediction? What would you have done differently? As far as I know, those who were most successful shorting the S&amp;P before 08' were those who started hedge-funds for that sole purpose.
