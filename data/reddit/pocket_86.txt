That's what I thought too, but in this transaction, there was 0.9949387 BTC being moved out, and that was it. Like I said, this address has never had more than 1.4 BTC in it before, so I'm not sure where the 20.08 BTC and 2.11 BTC come from

Ah, so the 20.08 BTC there is just another amount in the same block as my transaction was a part of?

Sorry if this is already out there - I looked and couldn't find an answer. 
Can someone tell me what the two amounts highlighted in yellow in the pic are? This address has never had more than 1.4 BTC at a time. so I'm wondering what the 20.08378528 BTC and 2.11021159 BTC are.

Thanks, that makes sense. I saw those numbers and was really confused there

Jaxx seems to only have 3 options - FAST, AVERAGE, and SLOW, but it doesn't specify any percentage ( I guess that makes sense) for fees. Even selecting 'slow', I cannot transfer out the remaining balance :'(

Hold me OP I'm scared

I figured waiting out the high-fees issue might be the best bet. I'm not in a hurry, thank goodness. Switching to SegWit is one small step in the right direction, I hope
