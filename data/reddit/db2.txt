It's also possible this post is now removed because LBC only consented to give his shit back if it was removed so nobody sees they're shady as fuck.

Thinking about it is the game though, if you think about it you're already playing, and lost, all at once.
Fine I'll spill it. I am the game, so by the game rules I'm lost. But I'm not lost, and because the game has a binary outcome I therefore won the game. Note this falls apart if you're actually lost somewhere though.

I bought it with the purpose of pissing it away by that very method, so it's not really something I get upset about. It helped me at a bad time so ten dollars well spent as far as that goes.

Your first statement is wrong, and the second contradicts it anyway. As usual shitty altcoin is shitty, and served two purposes: 1, teach greedy kids to use their head first, and 2, fail spectacularly in such a way as to demonstrate how *not* to do something when it comes to bitcoin.

I found evidence of censorship once. It was reddit doing it to a default subreddit for basically political reasons. I didn't start off with sharpening the torches and lighting the pitchforks, I explained what was going on so others could see it, *and detailed what should be done to show the admins at the time they were making the wrong decision*. It blew up all over reddit... I wasn't prepared for that. Everyone was upset. There was some drama of course, people saying nasty shit and/or ragequitting, it's almost unavoidable, but both "sides" were talking and though some things that were said weren't liked from either camp, the end result was that everyone understood and everyone more or less agreed. Know what started the whole messy thing? One simple misunderstanding that resulted in one oversight. There was never any malice, no conspiracy.
Long story short, even when it's true that doesn't mean it's true. There's usually more to the story and sometimes that more can change the meaning of it all.

If the account was/is shadowbanned he still has the account and he can still edit anything, but we can't see any *new* posts or comments he makes. For all we know he's replied to everyone in this very thread, the admins won't extend any powers at all to deal with shadowed accounts to the moderators. There is also no time limit for *editing* a text post or comment so if the aforementioned is correct the late edit date isn't meaningful.
The edit was a bad idea no matter who did it but it's not necessarily a reddit conspiracy. Never attribute to malice what is adequately explained by stupidity, and this could easily be ordinary stupidity on Luka_Magnotta's part.

The proper thing to do is let the old ones still work even if it's slow, while the new one works alongside. Give users a week or three to change over and then remove the old entirely.
Maybe bitcoin needs a bounce feature.
Edit: to expound on that, the idea is an address gets flagged by the owner of it which gets recorded in the blockchain. The owner can remove the flag too the same way. When it's flagged the address will reject any incoming coin, sending it back to the original sender without additional fees taken (that's important). In this way an address can be properly retired and not become a place to burn coins unintentionally. On the off chance someone in the future inherits the privkey (I'm discounting them stumbling on it) they'd be able to unflag and use it. On the less off chance someone decides to troll with it by flagging the sending address too, to try make blockchain spam as the coins get bounced back and forth like pong, after a certain number of bounces (let's say five) it can get sent to some charity or something, or if that's not workable then burnt. (I was going to say miners get it but that's a can of worms right there)

Bitcoin was obfuscated to a point that it gave some effective privacy, but that was a side effect of the tools to examine a blockchain not existing the way they do today.

On blockchain.info you can set up a purchase, then go to Wally World or a bunch of other places and actually do the paying. It's easier than horsing around with virwox and all their fees.
Go to the blockchain.info page for your address, you'll see a button to do it with.

Idiots. You stop this by releasing a modified version that sends back shit data. As the modified one spreads the operator's efficiency drops. It's unlikely he implemented versioning in his protocol use, his botnet would be rendered useless or close enough to it that it wouldn't be worth the trouble.
Why is it "experts" never see the simplest solutions to problems?

Chrome user here. Used to use Firefox, round about the third time I encountered a release version with major UI and code flaws I gave up and went to Seamonkey. That was great for a while, but like all Gecko-based products I've ever used, including pre-Gecko products from Netscape, it got slooooooow after a couple months of use. Tried Chrome, it stayed fast, so I kept using it.

Buying bitcoins. For instance go to  and click the button "Deposit With Cash", then set it up and print the page, then take that page to wherever the most convenient place listed is (probably Wally World) show them the sheet and pay them.

If the first one with no fee won, then the second one with a fee which got confirmed won *or* lost, that'd be really bad. Imagine you did this with 100BTC to SatosiDice, if either won you'd be ahead, and if *both* won you'd get free money for nothing. What's to stop someone from doing it 100 times with the same 100BTC? SatoshiDice may as well be an unlocked ATM now.

Nobody suggested DDOS, only poisoning the well. If the shit data can be ignored it has to be identified as such first, which will take time. If 50% of the input is shit data even if it's thrown out it will introduce a delay in the process, and a delayed mine is a worthless one right?

I'm enjoying the downturn. Faucets are paying out decently again for one thing, those were always fun but moreso when it was more than 3 satoshi at a time. I'm also planning to buy some while it's low, frankly kind of hoping for mid-late 2012 prices again. It's not much fun when you're priced out of doing anything. And it'll go back up, then down, then up, etc etc. BTC won't be stable until it's taken for granted as a concept, so enjoy the ride because it's happening regardless.
Edit: apparently there's some interest in the faucets.. message me for my list if you want, I don't think linking it in the sub is allowed.

KYC for crypto is a bad thing. I don't think it should be enforced for small amounts of fiat either, including going from crypto to fiat or reverse, but I also see how that can be abused by bad actors.

Yes, those corporations rely on human *components* for continued existence. Most of the components are tied to doing the bidding of the corporation, or they will be removed and replaced. The components capable of steering the corporation do so non-altruistically, which means the corporation behaves that way as well. They consume, grow, react to stimulus, reproduce, and even consume one another. There are viruses that do those things and we call them alive.

It's not about will, it's about what's legal. Bitcoin is legal, being federally regulated they shouldn't (likely don't) have the right to treat it as a special case let alone as though it were something illegally done through their system. They'll be allowed to keep doing it until they're told not to, and they won't be told not to until it's challenged within the legal system. That's how things work.

They were unique.
When you go to the site, you can scroll through them all one page at a time. There are like billions. I mashed number keys in there and went to that page, then chose one, two or three that I liked added the privkey to the official bitcoin wallet, and let it do its thing.
There was no logic. There was no forethought.

@_date: 2016-05-02 03:59:56
Both are equally valid.
I could give you a private key with ten bucks worth on it, if you used it to store more bitcoin (foolish) then you would be allowing me to take them, and because that's how bitcoin works you would be knowingly doing this. If you wanted it safe you would use a unique key.
In the case of an unwittingly copied key, it's still user error for not keeping it safe.

This shit is why I refuse to use Coinbase. That and the dishonest name itself, it makes a user who doesn't know any better think Coinbase the company is somehow integral to every TX and RX on the entire network - "oh it says coinbase, I've heard of that company." Dishonest pukes.

If order isn't relevant that helps but it still means if you want to play your own numbers you have to spend extra to do it unless you always play 00 as part of your choices.

Nope, it's probably got a new signature so it fails when they don't match. They probably switched something important that can't just be upgraded.

I've resynced many times, it always slows at the point I started using it, which was after Satoshi Dice came around.

Started to slow down about the point where it found your transactions started, correct?

What a goofy counterintuitive name that is.
Thanks for the link.
@_date: 2013-02-03 03:06:47
What that means for someone who doesn't know, a better could throw 1BTC at SatoshiDice with a low or no transaction fee, then quick like a bunny respend that same 1BTC somewhere else with a transaction fee included. The second transaction will move faster than the first, thereby getting in to the blockchain first. If the timing is just right they can get away with it, then win or lose they're ahead, especially if they send that 1BTC to another address they control. Note that standard clients don't allow for this to happen, and you can see why.
@_date: 2013-03-06 02:30:07
Not sure. As far as I know nothing's disabled in the browser. I'm on a TF101. Maybe I found a gremlin.

I bought 1BTC with the express purpose of blowing it on SatoshiDice. It worked. ;p
I never got above that initial investment, but I also never bet much at a time. It was intended to be a distraction for me lasting weeks. I wouldn't mind playing more but I'd only do so now if it didn't involve spending my own money to do so.
@_date: 2013-02-01 02:03:14


So if I wanted to play with the first number as 90 I'd have to spend near an entire bitcoin extra just to do that? Pass.

Which only goes to show your knowledge of credit card processing is rudimentary at best.
Edit: Yeah, downvote me, because sticking your head in the sand is the answer. If you had clue one what it was like being on the business end of cc processing instead of just the consumer end you might not be so smug. You probably think it's free because swiping your card costs you nothing.
