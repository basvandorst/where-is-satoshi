Got a thread link perhaps?

Did you bother to read any response before replying? Jesus Christ you're slow.

What a helpful response to my question. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 16:33:34
"Surprise they went away" was your first response, which isn't what I asked for at all. I asked if anyone had any relevant information, which a user already provided. I'm sorry you couldn't be useful... try again next time maybe?

Wow, sorry you're having such a bad day friend. Check out some other replies in the thread and see how hard it was to put minuscule effort into not being a total jackass. Does that make sense to you? Or do I need to explain in another way?

Let's agree to both have a pleasant rest of our day, eh?

Appreciate it

So happy to hear you share the positivity! This is really just an example of where Bitcoin is making differences. Small benefits lead to life changing rewards and allow us all to "make it" just maybe a little bit easier. Wishing you all the luck in the world and have a great day

Too true! I still have a smallish amount and have been buying back weekly to increase my holdings. I've already made ten fold my original investment so I can't ever "loose" anything in my mind

Haven't seen them post in awhile though, do you know if this is still active? I donated ~10 coins over those years, crazy to think about now haha

I paid for two years of school with my coin, don't care because no student loans but fuck... no student loans AND I'd be wealthy!

I would also be glad to trade you, pm me

Very few people move 500 million and none of them are going to help you 
@_date: 2017-08-12 20:59:22
Don't worry. Many before you have lost much more selling early, loosing wallets, buying drugs on the deepweb, sending to wrong exchanges, investing with havelock, etc
