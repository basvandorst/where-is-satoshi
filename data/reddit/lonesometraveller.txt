Can you elaborate? Or provide a link where I can read more about this?

You're a really cool guy.. Thanks for existing lol

The ledger is not separate from the key. That's what's unique about Bitcoin. It's worthless without the ledger. And thieves steal access to the ledger from you.

Awesome. Thanks!

Question about HD wallet.. So I've read that you should always put leftover BTC in a paper wallet in a new paper wallet in case you decide to spend a bit from it. Does the same apply to HD wallets?

I'm talking about the Mycelium app. I don't have a hardware wallet.

Yeah.. This guy can't even predict the future amirite?

Well there was this one time.. Goddammit he's about to disown me!

That shill won't respond to this.

Is that sub banned? 
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:18:14
I have done that. All of it is stored in a few paper wallets.

"Oh noes it's totally unusable as a currency because it's appreciating in value so much so that people want to HODL instead of spending it.!!"
People value Bitcoin so much that they ignore the high fees whereas your scam artist leader has to steal brand names and domains to even keep your shitcoin in public eye. Bcash will die when LN comes and you'll buy BTC after swallowing your pride.
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:36:47
No you missed the point. If it was about transaction fees why should anyone use your shitcoin over say, litecoin? 
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:47:06
This post triggers me. Please research more.
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:13:04
They can't cash in on the sky high fees when the fees become negligible after LN comes. So they'll milk BTC right now but they have incentive to claim BCH as the "real" Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:19:10
Right... You want to spend BTC to buy pizza today when the same amount can buy you food for a month later. Maybe investment is not your thing?

Bitcoin needs to have its price discovered first before it is viable as a currency. Which is what's happening now. Otherwise how can people determine how many coins to pay for goods and services? The same thing happened with gold before gold backed currency came about.
And there's no point crying about the fees right now because developers are working on it as we speak. The point of this thread is how exchanges and miners have incentives to not go with the solutions.
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:05:05
By that logic, gold would be worthless if no one believed it to have value anymore.
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:12:05
He looks disappointed in me...

Decentralized means it doesn't need a third party like a central bank to act as a source of trust in order to do a transaction between you and another person. It also means that you don't need to store the coins at one location. You can access it anywhere as long as you have the key. 
Decentralized doesn't mean secure in the sense that you can afford to have your key stolen and still have your money safe.
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:27:57
Ain't that the truth
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:11:50
No it's stored on the blockchain. Bitcoins aren't things you put in a wallet. A wallet is just the set of public and private keys that lets you access the coins. In fact, wallet is a misnomer.

Well good thing you're not in charge of development then. Satoshi himself reduced the blocksize to 1 MB as a protection against DOS attack. And yeah, your pumpanddumpcoin trash is just another alt. You come here talking about fees, there are cheaper alts out there.

There are several posts on the front page discussing it. Quit your bullshit.
