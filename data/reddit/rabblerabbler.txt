What money should be spent on is a different question than if it should be spent at all.

Bring the fucking odor? Is this what you do, kid, go on the internet and throw insults around? Like "fite me irl" stuff? It's really pathetic, you know.
@_date: 2018-01-01 21:44:31
Of course you do, on yourself only! Fuck off anarchist scum.
@_date: 2018-01-02 01:05:48
Honor? Welfare money? You live in some strange parallel dimension. Just because I don't agree with everything my taxes are spent on doesn't mean taxes are somehow "evil". 
They pay for infrastructure, schools, police, fire department, scientific research, and all of the *necessary* bureaucracy that a modern society needs to function.
You are talking about anarchy, the lack of community, what Thomas Hobbes called a "brute, nasty and short life" that we abandoned some 20.000 years ago.

Well, if you're in Stockholm I could give you directions?
@_date: 2018-01-01 00:50:55
But how would you prefer me to put up, sir? Is there something specific you would want me to put in you?
@_date: 2018-01-01 22:40:12
Where did you get that? Where do you get any of this? FOX news? Breitbart? It literally makes zero sense whatsoever.
@_date: 2018-01-01 21:42:58
No, I didn't. Nobody did that. You are just redefining the "common good" for your OWN good, all the evil springing from that is on the hands of anarchists as yourself.
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:44:06
Ha ha ha! Awesome!
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:06:38
It's more redistribution for the common good, but perhaps you don't see yourself as "common".

There is SO much improvement and wealth to be made for savvy programmers right now. I wish I was one of them.
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:38:47
You already do. And you're welcome, by the way.

I've had $3K stuck for 10 days now. I did send it with a low fee, stupidly, but they wanted like $120 to send it which is Fuck Off territory for me.
Is it possible that it won't ever transact? I am really losing faith in bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:04:45
How much is the reward?
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:00:32
Great, I can't wait until we descend into anarchy.

Though I think you may have dropped one Adderall too many tonight, you have a talent for expressing yourself, and you should definitely try to hone that skill. 
Step 1 is to cut everything you want to say down to way fucking less, brevity is the soul of wit you know, and in the words of Albert F. Einstein, "perfection is not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away".
If you need more unsolicited insults disguised as advice, PM me.
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:55:38
This is good. All transactions matter!

I can't fucking believe I actually owned several bitcoin at one point.

Ok so, and correct me if I'm wrong here, but what I'm getting from this is, invest in bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-10-30 11:26:53
"Ha ha ha, in this sub, people think you're retarded for saying that! I think so too, btw."
@_date: 2017-10-30 13:47:46
Me neither, up to today. I mean, people say all the time that you shouldn't keep BTC online, but apparently Blockchain.info have signed the contentious hard fork, which, I admit, I have no idea what it is but for whatever reason don't keep your BTC on blockchain.
Might as well put them on Mycelium or similar on your phone.
@_date: 2017-10-30 14:34:01
I'm just glad that I didn't sell them as such, but bought commodities with them, and then snorted those commodities.
@_date: 2017-10-30 11:27:25
Now hdol on for drea lfie!
@_date: 2017-10-30 14:28:14
Doesn't matter if you have no idea what you're doing, as long as you trust that other people know what they're doing and do the same.
