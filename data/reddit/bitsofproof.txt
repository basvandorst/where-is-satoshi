You have no idea.

that industry often abuses recurring payments feature of credit cards for automatic renewal. Fortunatelly not available in bitcoin.

You hit the nail. Yes, if there was any revenue for me for the service, then I could offer higher reliability.

I apologize for any downtime on mytrezor.com caused by problems with the back end software or its operation. Marek and myself are working to increase uptime, that was more than 94% according to SatoshiLab's latest measures.
Please remain fair with my product. It enables Trezor and delivers a service still unmatched by others after nearly a year of its introduction.

I want to evaluate this with Marek. Providing unlimited complementary service for a product once bought can hardly be perpetuated as resource and uptime requirements accumulate with adoption. I hope we can come up with a premium offer that goes beyond an uptime guarantee.

I recall that this was not a mistake, but your rescue, as no one other than me was able to support your innovative product. This unfortunatelly did not change over the last year. I wish it would, as I wish for your success and peace of mind for your customer by having alternatives for the limitied downtimes that sometimes occured.

For quality of bits of proof don't imply from rumors, but observe that it was more than a year ahead of others, enabled the TREZOR product in the first place and is serving thousands of customer daily ever since.

I am close to 50 and know bitcoin as good as a core dev. My older son knows I am working on Bitcoin, but won't use it until there are other options to pay for the gym. Being young probably helps, but Bitcoin only excites geeks as of now.
