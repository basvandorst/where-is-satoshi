I'm going to just sneak it into their bags, they won't even know I gave it.

Does anyone here not care that all bitcoin transactions are completely traceable while zerocoin transactions won't be?

RBC and BMO.  I am trying TD at the moment, see how long before they kick me out too.  If they see a lot of bitcoin transactions there, they will throw you and won't give you a reason.

Their server was down over the weekend.  Works fine for me now.

Maybe because the banks own all the TV stations and would never allow a pro bitcoin commercial on their stations?

I got my trezor but it doesn't work.  When it tries to load my account balances the mytrezor.com page freezes and I have been unable to resolve this problem.

If you think that, why don't you just go short bitcoin?

I have personally been thrown out of 2 banks for purchasing bitcoin and I know many others who have had the same thing happen to them.  I am in the process of being completely banned from basic banking in my country (Canada).  It is an unfortunate fact that banks can do whatever they want, they are above the law, and there is nothing you can do to stop them.

Are you currently looking into ways to help make bitcoin completely anonymous?  What do you think of the zerocoin protocol and will it ever be incorporated into the bitcoin protocol?
@_date: 2014-11-29 14:37:01
Here is a starter for them.  Don't kick me out for dealing in bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-02-18 12:52:31
BMO was never a bitcoin friendly bank..... I simply mentioned bitcoin to them and they threw me out of my personal account.  Do not mention bitcoins to banks.  Lie to them.
@_date: 2014-09-21 16:51:04
If it is so friendly, then why have the 5 major banks banned all bitcoin related transactions and threaten to kick out bank clients on repeated offences?
@_date: 2014-11-10 01:13:45
the bear is suppose to represent all people shorting bitcoin right now.

Why can't GHash.io do something in which they publicize the block that is about to be mined, which can be verified by miners there are no double spend attempts in this block, if miners detect a double spend attempt, they can immediately leave this pool and set their miners to mine at another pool.  This way keeping the basic mindset of bitcoin that "if so long as most users are honest, then bitcoin works"

You can invest in bitcoin shorts at bitfinex
