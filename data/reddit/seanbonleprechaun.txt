if it forks and falls, it was time wasted and a word that rhymes with need.   names used to divide?  for division
 confuses a fragile mind. where did that beautiful paper go. i think the paper was white?   am I right.  now it's quite blue.  or red?  or maybe it's a lie to tell the truth.   the earth is....o i wont go that far luke. or maybe, im just little confused.  you guys, the world needed her glow.  it isn't nice to see what she should be, now torn in two, called names which are merely mind games.  there should not be two sides.  but we humans have quite the time, time being the key, destroying beauty,  unbelievable simple complexity.  this is the chaos we created.    wake up people.

I wish you were right.  I wish people knew time was a lie. but Satoshi  crated an idea that which will slowly reveal the facade.  and for that, his genius always makes me know glimmers of hope carry on.

one side says, take what's yours, other says, live on no more than you can afford. but either way we just possess, and everyone ends up with less.
