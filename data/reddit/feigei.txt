There have been previous posts on the same topic, such as "
I am not sure, which ones are safe/not safe though. But if you are worried that websites are tracking you, you should consider hiding your IP then. Most websites track IPs...

Yes, you can send whenever you want, but you still need to pay a fee for each transaction. It's like an incentive for the people/servers that mine. The higher your fee, the more priority they will put on your transaction.
P.s. I'm a noob too, so it's better if you read up more on bitcoin/blockchain

Every exchange has a different rate and they are mostly near the same value. For example, the value on bitstamp is usually lower than the value on coinbase. Rates very quickly, but on exchanges like cex, they offer market order, that locks in the price for 60sec I think, but it costs you a small fee. Same goes for atm. As for desktop wallets, I think you can manually set to which exchange it takes it rates from.

I don't think that letting people know how bad you are doing as an exchange is great for business. You are thinking of the benefits of a customer, but exchanges are still businesses... On top of that, I suspect that none of the exchanges have enough staff to answer every ticket competently, especially since the last few weeks as there have been spikes of new clients.
Cex.io has a satisfaction counter in the bottom right though.

Credit cards are not identifications. Anyone could steal your card and buy bitcoins. But the main reason is that of money laundering, tax evasion, I think. USA and UK companies need to provide the necessary information for the government to know if their citizens need to pay taxes. If you are lucky, there might be bitcoin ATM around you, I don't think they require identifications.
