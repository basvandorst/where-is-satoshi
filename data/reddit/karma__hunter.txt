Thanks for helping me out then ;)

Oh ok,btw I don't know too much yet so if you don't mind me asking, can you buy from coinbase and connect the wallet to bitpay to pay via there?
@_date: 2018-12-01 09:40:38
Honestly I only have enough money to buy 0.015 BTC so trying to make a payment of 0.013 without getting butt fucked by taxes is hard haha
The only possible way to pay ( that I can use) is bitpay so im trying to see where do I make everything (wallet, purchase, payment,etc.) And still have enough money to pay
@_date: 2018-12-01 09:46:22
Is an alternative to coinbase?
@_date: 2018-12-01 09:46:58
Yeah I was thinking either card or cash so instant I suppose
@_date: 2018-12-01 10:34:25
Looks awesome but I can't use it in Argentina, I hate this country

I can only hope haha, FYI here 1 dollar per hour of any job and that is with luck, and the average rent is 800 dollars with 200-300 of expenses and a cool 100 for a month food.
So you can guess how fucked we are
We got lucky and my family jobs all earn in dollars so we now live comfortably ( not 1 year ago tho)

Btw is a $12  fee to buy from coinbase to me haha
@_date: 2018-12-01 12:28:31
If you have dollars in investment you are rich the moment you get here, because at the point we are now a Starbucks is 2.50 dollars when in USA is 5 ( so you get an idea of the price difference) imagine that if in NA you live with ~3500 and here with ~1000  you can have lots of pesos in a monthly payment
Edit: thanks you and the same goes for you.

I checked again the web page and it looks like I can only pay via bitpay, can I buy in coinbase and transfer it to bitpay without too much % taken off?
@_date: 2018-12-01 10:47:00
Are you implying that the price of Bitcoin isn't extremely erratic?
@_date: 2018-12-01 10:30:06
That page it was in TOMT haha I remembered seeing it few months ago but I could make out which one was it, thanks, im checking localbitcoins and revoult like another person said
@_date: 2018-12-01 12:33:51
Wow thanks for actually links, although im in Argentina so some (almost everything) won't work but I'll try anyway
@_date: 2018-12-01 09:17:22
Hahaha, can I skip to the third point directly?
(Also how long does I take for me to get my BTCs?)
@_date: 2018-12-01 08:54:05
Thanks, if everything goes well I'll update haha
@_date: 2018-12-01 09:01:36
I responded to myself intend of you lol
@_date: 2018-12-01 09:01:14
They accept other methods but I do not have a dollar credit card not a UK debit card
I believe the service is called IBT
@_date: 2018-12-01 09:55:35
It accepts bitpay, credit card and UK debit card
I can only pay via bitcoins and I just checked that coinbase cannot be used where I live -_-
Im starting to think that I might as well not buy it Whit how hard it is haha
@_date: 2018-12-01 09:57:56
Oh ok, thanks a lot! ;)
@_date: 2018-12-01 10:41:31
Haha thanks you man, extremely helpful and revoult sadly (and as a surprise to no one) doesn't support Argentina
I hate my country,dollars going waaaayyy up, macri being an asshole, and 60% tax in imports
(Also in local bitcoins is 60 dollars for 0.011 only)
