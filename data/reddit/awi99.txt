if you are transfering more than 100,000 bitcoins... why to put all those decimals? LOL

I don't like how Adobe only uses nvidia cards cuda technology for it's new products.

USD weak and everybody wanting bitcoins...

if they can put more decimals later in the future.. it would be like creating new coins overriding the limit of 21M... not good...

erased or moved files can be easily recovered. you must use a file wiper

the biggest problem of bitcoin.. is... Bitcoin 2.0, and Bitcoin 3.0, and then Megabitcoin 4.05 beta. I mean anyone could start a new algorithm... and become another network of virtual equally secure coins. but only one must be used or it could ruin the advantage of a limited supply.

you would need to install the system in a virtualbox... so she can do whatever without interrupting your virtualbox session... also install a vnc server to access it anytime you want to check that virtualbox.

I understand that saving money is good.. but if everybody is saving bitcoins because it is very predictable that it's value will be always rising... then it is not working well as money in a way of exchange... but more in a way of savings... but those savings won't be anything if you can't spend it later because bitcoin has gone or because has become illegal, or who knows... 
one other aspect I don't like about bitcoin is that anyone could start a new coin.. like.. bitcoin2.. bitcoin3.. or megabitcoin... or whatever name.. just another network and start again... 
bitcoin is an experiment.. it is not easy to redesign international world economy just like that. however... it is very interesting to follow it and  it is a logical result of frustrations around current monetary system based on banks. that has to change somehow.

well I think the ideal thing would be not to compare BTC to USD. That would be the real power of bitcoins... having their own economy... you don't want inflation problems of the USD to affect bitcoin right?  Bitcoin should be independent. At least is how I think about it. The problem is that you can buy bitcoins with USD. not a good idea.
