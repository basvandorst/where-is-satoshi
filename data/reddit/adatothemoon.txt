Prices are recovering. Get back into crypto now! 
The time is 3:00 p.m. eastern time. I put the time here, so idiots who waited to long to buy in will be like damn it if I only stumbled upon the Asian on reddit at 3:00 p.m..

I apologise for making you angry. It was not my intent.

I rely on it alright. I think everybody has to go through a crash to come back on top. I started investing in August of last year. I'm glad that this crash came relatively quick in my investing career the quicker the better

I like the fact that I am better at investing now that I just went through a crash. Everybody should.

Bad news: Bitcoin might not too bullish the current moment. 
Good news: We all get to pump and dump the petro to get more Bitcoin!

I actually like this crash. It taught me a lot of lessons about investing. If anybody feels like shit, I lost more than 100k. Don't worry guys. It will bounce back. However, it might take longer than you guys think.

I'm not.

Sell and wait until after the g20 meeting or try your luck with dgd. That being said I do think there is high chance of a stock market bubble which will pop. Which will make gold pop. Which will make dgd pop. This might sound like weird advice, but the best coins to invest in are the ones with really low supply and prices above 100. Least likely to be pumped and dumped. There are very few of those and not very popular because people have this idiotic reasoning that high marketcaps is a good thing. Go long!

Investing is almost always gambling. Look at the stock market only the people who get in early with a lot of shares have any voice in how the company is run. There are very few cryptocurrencies that have signifigany real world use. People only invested in bonds because they thought rates were going to lower and lower. Now that it's going high everybody dumping them. 
So you are right. I am a gambler. We are all gamblers. To the moon!

It's a bet against the dollar. Bitcoin will never be technologically Superior to other payment systems. The Federal reserve prints unlimited money. Bitcoin only has 21 million. Bitcoin is a bet that when bond yields skyrocket people will realize their currency is devalued and go into Bitcoin.

Your probably right! Chill out dude. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 04:55:02
I agree!

That's why you invest in alts with lower supplies and high prices. Don't chase high supply low prices coins. You will be pumped and dumped like tomorrow. I do agree with you that's a problem. The fact that all alts are tied to btc is bad.
