There is also just a lot of bullish info peppered through his answers too. Stuff like Visa and Mastercard references stuff about various crypto services. It just goes on and on. Lots of great stuff in this interview.

The Chyron Scripts at the bottom of the screen, reporting on Chinese Premier Li Keqiang's remarks at the WEF are probably more important than what Roubini is saying.

I am buying at these levels and even if BTC goes to 9200-9600, which I see people saying, I am buying around 10k and even where it is now at 10,200-10,500.

I deposited USD directly to Coinbase a couple days ago, reading that it would take 3-5 days to process the transaction, also with the understanding that this would be the fastest way to transfer funds into the crypto world and start trading them (I was going to exchange them for BTC, then send the BTC to Binance to trade for alts). However, Coinbase now says the transfer will take 10 days before I have access to my funds!
Does anyone know a faster way to get direct access to crypto (BTC, ETH, USDC, etc.) that I can send to another platform and start trading for alts immediately? Preferably instant access or maybe next day or something? Thanks. I am a US user by the way.

Sounds like they will offer consulting to institutional players on the tech and help them distinguish between the different projects. 
Edit: On second reading, their services could exceed 'institutions' and extend to broader swaths of people.

What does this chart say? That there was a dump of $240M, but there is strong support at that level, so the price did not decline, indicating a likely bottom?

Consider buying a ledger nano x. They cost a hundred USD and provide security. They also make it easier to hodl instead of constantly trading and potentially losing lots of money. Other than that I would just google stuff like 'best place to buy bitcoin canada' and 'how to transfer btc from \[X\] to my ledger' or things like that.

It suggests that they have solved the custody problem. Essentially that you can feel safe holding your coins on a platform like E\*Trade, which I think is a major question with this technology, whether or not 3rd parties like banks or financial services groups can safely hold coins (provide custody).

there are only a couple tv channels that are referred to as 'business news' channels. fox business, bloomberg news, and cnbc. those are the three channels that deal with business news that i know of.

It is likely that their coin will be tradable on exchanges like Binance, therefore money will flow into BTC and to other altcoins.

Have you guys noticed that the exchange with the second highest BTC volume according to [coinmarketcap.com]( is a Brazilian exchange with direct to BRL (Brazilian Real, the Brazilian dollar) called Negocie Coins, and that is after BitMEX - which does XBT trading, I assume for Wall Street traders?

Well there was dead air with respect to bitcoin for many months and now there are many multiple stories and interviews and on sunday 60 minutes is doing a piece on it so you could be right but maybe something else is going on.

I don't know for sure, but I think that regardless of how much time you spend clicking on facebook, you will earn some coins.

Well the argument in the news segment is that there are 2 billion people who use facebook, and for a good portion of those users, this will be their first exposure to blockchain and that eventually this will lead to more capital flowing into other digital assets like bitcoin and ethereum.
@_date: 2019-05-08 04:00:53
Idk why you think this coin would be any different from the others I am aware of. Why wouldn't it be tradable on exchanges like Binance? Also did you watch the video. That is the same assumption that the guy is making.

they keep saying that the next two years will be a bull run. the year before and the year after the next 'halving' of btc. that is when btc will start creating 6 btc per minute to miners instead of the current 12 per minute to miners.

i think it is called logarithmic graph or algorithmic graph. i think it is something like that, but essentially it is like orders of magnitude like 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000 etc
