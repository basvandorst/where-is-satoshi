Pretty sure bitcoin is going up in value as the major country economies become increasingly unstable.  In the USA we have record bank corruption, record government corruption, record wealth disparity.  The establishment old money is holding on for dear life by rigging the laws in their favor as much as possible because they can’t compete otherwise.  Net neutrality is next; 86% of the USA population wants internet to be treated as a utility yet fcc still sells out.  It’s a fucking joke and everyone who’s been paying attention sees this.  The emperor has no clothes. 
Bitcoin it’s digital gold and gold increases in value as economies become more unstable.  Once the tipping point is reached I predict massive and unprecedented swings in wealth and power.
HODL because in the 3 year time window we all know bitcoin is the right play.  Does it really matter to freak out day to day at this thing or that thing?  This is all noise.  
Buy as much bitcoin as you can, go to fucking sleep... wake up in 2-3 years... and be wealthy
U want to make bitcoin or bitcoin cash take over the world faster?  Figure out a way to install a make-believe-bitcoin-credit-card on Apple Pay via jail broken iPhones.  Boom now we can pay for every day things at any store that is integrated with Apple Pay.  The revolution will not be televised.

You don’t think the likes of big pharma, private prisons, Wall Street, big tobacco, big alcohol, military industrial complex etc... bribe both parties?  
Might want to consider dropping the whole partisan politics thing and..... look into it.  
Overwhelming majority of people in USA are actually independent and don’t give a crap about “teams” and a handful of wedge issues. 
As far as net neutrality is concerned it doesn’t take a genius to see that a fair even and open internet is an engine of innovation and opportunity for all of us.  Comcast and Verizon are not just going to make slow lanes ... but also make package bundles just like they did on cable tv... South Park did an episode on it... and the creators lean libertarian (and even they see it) so spare me the diatribe.... 
liberal , conservative... who gives a shit. those terms are not only co-opted by legacy media, but also their meanings change over time.  Those who still fall in line with a  “liberal” or “conservative” team get caught up in it.  It’s all bullshit.  Most of the tech-centric youth sees right through this; as they should

Free markets need an open internet. Not one controlled by Verizon and Comcast.... historically horribly monopolistic companies that get massive corporate subsidies from our taxes... yet are privately owned.

Some country's currency is crashing.  Bitcoin is similar to gold .  People are buying bitcoin because it's safer than their country's currency ... if i had to guess.  But of course I could be way off lol

As long as governments on this planet keep things illegal, it'll never crash because there will always be a real use for it besides a "buy and hold" venture.  In the long run btc goes up

Lol... sooooo let me get this straight:
1) bitcoin recently breaks 3k and still climbing extremely fast and no one really knows why.
2) few days later, CNN (main stream media) is telling the world that bitcoin is not a bubble.
3)* ya think mayyyyyybe a bunch of colluding 1%er investors are responsible for the recent surge in bitcoin price and now that they all bought in they bribe CNN to tell the world btc is not a bubble after the fact? 
I do think bitcoin is going up in the 3 year timespan but this recent surge right before its broadcast on main stream media (what dumb people watch) seems like a pump and dump to me.  Will probably bubble for a month at least.  Maybe I'm a conspiracy theorist but this is what I'm seeing

Yep... I am serous.  It’s a race for adoption at this point.  Venezuela’s lack of financial infrastructure and corrupt establishment and ruined fiat currency all the things that satoshi made crypto to counter.  Destruction and creation a cyclical and money goes the way of least resistance.  So Venezuela is a great test for crypto currency mass adoption by a country.  Pretty sure bitcoin cash is already being used like crazy over there.

Not conspiracy... just greed.  It’s human nature.  Ever wonder why bitcoin doesn’t follow its original white paper with regards to block size?  It’s a way to throttle and tax transactions among other things.

No they aren’t going to “invest,” they are just using it as actual currency.  This isn’t a matter of “think,” it’s a matter of “fact.” It’s happening right now.  Their currency is hyper inflated to the point that the paper its printed on is worth more.  Y’all can downvote me or laugh at my comments all you want.  Doesn’t change what’s actually happening.

But it still has value as long as people believe it has value... like buying mansions with tulips in Denmark (true story)

The crypto currency that holds sway In Venezuela is probably going to be the crypto currency that wins worldwide.  The perfect battleground to test which crypto currency is best via mass adoption.

He who controls layer 2 protocols, controls bitcoin.

Do the opposite of whatever jp Morgan says.   Their business model is based on misleading the public.

It’s a race for adoption at this point imo.  I see a lot more businesses in my town accepting bitcoin cash than accepting bitcoin.   It seems to me that bitcoin is more like digital gold (buy and hold) and bitcoin cash is more like an actual currency.  It’s a shame that bitcoin didn’t become both in one.  But I’m not that smart and I don’t understand most of the threads in this subreddit

Imo every single attack on bitcoin that is unsuccessful only proves to do the opposite of the intention.  It actually makes it stronger because more people are able to trust how secure and tamper proof it really is.  
Let it get attacked more and more and bitcoin will only become stronger

Why do you need a lot of money to buy and use crypto?
