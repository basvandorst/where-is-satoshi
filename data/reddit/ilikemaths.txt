Bitcoin offers the following advantages over fiat:
* Universal pricing. Compare hospitals in Warsaw and Bangalore.
* No currency exchange fees. Use Circle for zero fees.
* No need to explain yourself (or your prostate surgery) when exchanging money. Moreover, no record of your surgery.
* Hospitals avoid chargebacks or handling large amounts of cash

Coinbase prices have historically been close to Bitstamp. But in the past few days, they have grown to $30 above Bitstamp. Maybe this will grow further.

tl;dw 
* First half of video is a review of Bitcoin and double-spending attacks.
* Bitcoin averages 1 TPS (transaction per second). To compete with Paypal (100 TPS) and Visa (2000 TPS), must either (a) increase block size &gt;1mb or (b) faster block time (eg litecoin uses 2.5 minutes, fastcoin uses 12 seconds). Otherwise, fees may rise to higher than Paypal and Visa.
* Both (a) and (b) lead to more forks in the blockchain. When total computing power is split between many forks, an attacker needs less than 50% computing power create the longest fork.
* Larger block size leads to more forks since block propagation is slow. Decker &amp; Wattenhoffer show that block propagation time grows linearly with block size.
* At 10 TPS, bitcoin is vulnerable to a 40% attack. At 40 TPS, bitcoin is vulnerable to a 25% attack.
* A partial solution is compressing blocks, but that can only go so far.
* Zohar's solution: Greedy Heaviest Observed Sub-Tree (GHOST) - pick the fork (and subfork) with the most blocks, not the longest fork. This preserves the 50% requirement for an attack. This allows scaling Bitcoin to 250 TPS.
* GHOST is already used by Ethereum.

Thank you for your fantastic criticisms! I will skip repetitive things.


Defrauded parties can bring charges. Perhaps allegations have a cost, to limit frivolous claims.


Cryptographically signed contracts.


An open-source program. Or a trusted third party (an Andreas type) who can be tried in real court. 


In trial, parties go back-and-forth with signed contracts, and the fraud's (e.g. Gox or hacker) inability to protect itself with a signed contract would be proof of fraud. This can be systematic, and can be defined in an open-source program, and both parties must protect themselves with signed contracts which are recognized by this program.


Taken before the coins are returned.


The community will demand tumblers to participate in fraud-prevention. Honest coins would fear using shady tumblers, in fear of tainting their coins.

Thank you for another fantastic reply!


5% cost and proper allegation. Why would you pay without being able to defend your allegations.


You must protect your coins with signed contracts. If you appear on the taint list, you can defend yourself and collect the trial fee.


You can bring charges with previous addresses, your own or whoever gave you the coins.


Incentives for all non-fraudulent parties. A good publicist.


Chinese parties can bring fraud charges agains US parties.


Each transaction includes a "hand-shake" between parties where they both sign some contract. Then at trial, heres pseudo-code:
    trial(plaintiff, defendent, claims)
        if defendent disproves claims
            return coins and trial fee to defendent
        else
            return coins to plaintiff and return trial fee to reporting merchant


Why would you taint your coins with one of Gox's addresses? You must protect yourself at all times.

* The Bitcoin protocol cannot handle that many transactions. The limit is about 18 million transactions per month. Two possible solutions are: minors adjust the limits, or coinbase and bitpay agree on off-blockchain payment clearing.
* It is nice to see that something like M-Pesa can succeed. Hey Bitcoin entrepreneurs, please recreate M-Pesa with Bitcoin. Hey Google, please allow bitcoin in Google Wallet!

I am lucky to get so many great replies from you today!


Yep, so you must always be able to protect yourself from trial trolls. And you earn 5% for doing so. Hopefully this can be automated by wallets.


Bob would have to ask you to bring it to trial. Without a contract, they would be unable to defend their coins. It would be wise to backup your coins with a transactions to yourself.


At transaction time, a private contract is signed with obligations of both parties. For example: 
    I, myAddress, hereby send 1BTC to mtGoxAddress. Any trade from mtGoxAddress must be signed by me. I permit mtGox to remove 1% fee per signed trade from mtGoxAddress. Trades can be accumulated and sent to the Bitcoin blockchain all-at-once.


Then some (tiny) percentage of your coins will be tainted. And those coins would have to be returned. Hopefully this will be automated by wallets.


No, Ethereum can run a trial.

tldr: A NFC-based battery-less keychain which signs Bitcoin transactions. Some details:
* Computation done by a tiny Texas Instruments MSP430 microcontroller.
* Draws energy from an NFC field (or an optional battery).
* Sign-time is 0.6 seconds (or 0.15s with battery).
* User-programmable optional spend-limits and pin-code.
* Supports HD addresses and multisig.
* A theoretical weakness is an electron microscope reading the private key from flash memory.
* The most glaring weakness is the manufacturer writes the original private key to device. So the manufacturer can theoretically sweep all of the addresses. (Edit: Correction from author - the pre-generated private key is for convenience, and the security-minded user can use their own private keys).
* THIS THING IS PERFECT SMALL EVERYDAY USE AND RETAIL!

Great find!
There are two steps, developing a theory and applying it.
The quote describes developing a mathematical theory (e.g. group theory, number theory). This entails making precise definitions and proving theorems using logic. Once a theory is developed, it remains a gift to humanity.
How applicable is this to Bitcoin? A theory can be applied to the real-world. For example, group theory is used by Einstein's relativity, and number theory is used by Nakamoto's decentralized ledger. Once a theory is applied, it remains a gift to humanity.
Sometimes, a theory is developed to solve a real-world problem, so the same person can develop AND apply the theory.
