Yeah a lot of those countries embrace crypto because the currencies of their own country are shit.  But as much as I dislike the dollar it's got this morbid price stability, where it goes down every year.

I can dig it.  Imagine you're trying to buy a pair of jeans (approx. US$50) imagine you have the bitcoin equivalent of US$65 in your account, but then the value of bitcoin goes down 5 minutes before you go to buy the jeans.  All of a sudden you can not afford them, but tomorrow maybe.  Erratic valuation in relation to goods and services would make it difficult to budget, or to really understand how much your bitcoin is worth.  Imagine you are a general contractor and you get paid for a job.  Then all of a sudden the value of bitcoin drops and you can't afford your mortgage.  It would have been nice to be able to set your price on your job to reflect costs and expenses, but its hard to know how much bitcoin to charge.
If I'm wrong on this by all means let me know.  I'm here to learn stuff.

Possible, but imagine you were trying to buy those jeans with eggs.  Today the price is 150 eggs for the jeans, but tomorrow there is a revolution in farming that makes egg farming substantially more efficient.  The eggs you had yesterday are now worth 30 percent less.  Now you need eggs you don't have to buy your jeans.  Then there's a mass chicken kill because the new tech makes zombie chickens.  Now the last of the chickens are owned by the wealthiest 1% of farmers and you gotta find something more price stable to pay for your jeans cause you lost your ass on eggs.
Imagine you're trying to save for your son's college education in bitcoin.  It's looking good, but 2 years before he is college bound your bitcoin tanks because another currency has a better use case.  When people save cash for their future or emergencies, they need price stability so that the sacrifices they made yesterday are sure to benefit them tomorrow.

To work like a currency would it not have to become more price-stable?
