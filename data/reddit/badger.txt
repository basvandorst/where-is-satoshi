Yes, you could.  You can simply report it in 2017 and add a footnote explaining it was income earned in 2015 you never paid tax on.  It's either that, or go back and file an amended 2015 return (not fun), or just not report it and hope they don't notice.

You could, but that would be a disservice to yourself since any purchases you made after your initial investment were likely at a higher cost.  You would be recognizing more of a gain than necessary.

Anything held for less than a year is a short term capital gain, which is taxed as ordinary income.  It's only a recognizable gain if you sell the bitcoin for cash.  If you are just holding, it's not taxable YET.  It becomes a capital gain when you sell it for cash.  At which point its reportable on Sch D of your tax return.

Technically you would still need to report any gains on sales of bitcoins to the Canadian government.
I have only prepared a couple Canadian tax returns before, but I'm pretty sure they have their own version of the US Schedule D.

It becomes a taxable capital gain when he exchanges the BTC for any other asset.  Sales tax is irrelevant to capital gains since it's a state level tax.  The IRS will let you report sales tax on Sch A as a deduction but that's a different topic.

Ya that's what I'm talking about. However it's a different threshold for dependents (children) and non-dependents (parents) and married vs single.  There is a rule that says any dependent who makes more than 1050$ unearned income needs to file, but your parents can elect to claim that income on their own return if it's under $10,500.  Anything above that has to be filled separately.

I deleted my first comment.  That was bad advice.  The donee assumes your cost as basis for the property (bitcoin), so they are expected to pay capital gains tax on any gain when they sell for cash.  However, if the 7000 was all they made, its unlikely they will owe much tax if any after the standard deduction and exemptions.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:52:59
Yes.  It's a capital gain of $10,000.

These were gifts to individuals?  No, the gifts would have to be toward a non-profit charity.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:48:09
The length of time just determines if it's a long term or short term capital gain.  Yes short term sales are simply taxed as ordinary income. Anything over a year and it is long term.  Simply holding Bitcoin is not a taxable gain. You have to sell it, or else it's just an unrealized gain and not taxable.  What the IRS wants is for Bitcoin to report payouts of large sums, because they know somebody must have had a gain, sold the bitcoin and are not reporting it.

By definition it is income.  It factors into your Adjusted Gross Income.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:10:01
Your parents would do it for you if they knew about the income.
Like we have clients who give us additional information on their kids (investment statements, ect.) Then we decide if the child has to also file or not.  In some cases if you make enough money then your income would be taxed at your parents rate.  They're called Kiddie Tax rules.
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:01:46
True. It's only a capital gain when you sell.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:10:41
No that's not what I'm talking about. There are cases where a dependent needs to file their own separate tax return apart from the parents.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:48:49
You're right they can make an election to report dependents income to an extent.

Digital currency isn't treated like regular fiat currency.

Mining would simply be income, so yes, there is no cost basis.  You worked for it and earned it.  No different then earning wages.  And ya I would put it on a schedule C business if not inside a LLC so you can deduct business expenses.
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:52:31
I think in that case there is no taxable transaction.  Just exchanging gifts of bitcoin with no conversion to cash is different than buying cars, ect. with bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:48:21
There is a threshold for filing a 1040, yes.  There is also a threshold now Coinbase has to abide by and allow the IRS to see.  So if you're trading amounts in excess of 20k, then the IRS will know about it and write you a letter most likely if you dont report it.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:02:53
I think you answered your own question.  They obviously gain from the private foreknowledge of adding BCH to their exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:25:18
I probably wouldn't worry about it unless its a significant amount.  I don't know what country you are from or how they treat taxes, but for US citizens they have to pay tax in the country they earn it.  Then on their US Tax Return they have what's called a foreign tax credit that prevents double taxation on the income.  It might be the similar for your home country.  So, yes, technically you might need to report your gains to the IRS on a form 1040.  However, maybe you don't because you don't meet the filing threshold.  It depends on how much money you're making.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:04:29
If you make more than $1000 of unearned income as a dependent, you are supposed to file.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:39:45
If you don't have any other income, like a part-time job W-2, then you don't even need to file.

I doubt the IRS will have any knowledge of the transaction, but lets say they do.  It's true all they will see is the withdrawal by your friend, and then they will expect capital gains tax from your friend and not you (having no knowledge of a gift).  You would avoid tax if you simply write your friend a check in cash (that isnt made from selling bitcoin), if cash is what they want and not bitcoin.

1.  That's a good question.  It's not unlike stock purchases of the same stock at different dates and then selling them separately on different dates for different prices.  The IRS will accept a reasonable approach to determining the basis.  I think it could be done more than one way.  I think the easiest way to do it would be to find an average cost basis per BTC you hold, then apply that average cost basis to the amount of BTC you sell.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:47:38
I think its pretty much the same.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:45:16
Yes, you would have to allocate your basis/cost to each bitcoin you sold. For example if you bought 1.0 BTC for 10,000$, then later sold 0.5 BTC for $10,000 when the price was at $20,000, you would have a taxable gain of $5,000.
