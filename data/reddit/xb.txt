If your heart is set on reporting the issue to some governmental organization, rather than waiting for coinbase to correct the issue they have acknowledged: 
However, I would prob wait a little while longer as they are clearly working on it.

Changing your password would only affect future backups and wallet access anyway. The old wallet backup would still be encrypted with your old password. So if you're worried that someone knows your password and that they have access to either your machine or the backup file &gt; you've gotta move your coins to a new wallet. 
 Bitcoin core doesn't generate addresses deterministicly. So the fact that wallet backups cover some number of your unused passwords is more of a security feature than a flaw. Otherwise you would have to create new backups every time you generated a new address - not something most people will think to do. I actually prefer to set my address pool to something huge, like 100,000, when I'm setting up new instances of bitcoin core. That way I can back it up once at the beginning and not have to worry that my backup won't cover some of my used addresses.
If your coins are at risk of immediate theft, sending them to a mobile wallet while you figure things out is safer than trying to preserve the old wallet. Probably not too worried about it being cumbersome if you're talking about any significant amount of coins. In fact i would think that the more coins you're storing, the more cumbersome your process of protecting them should be. 
Edit: Props for giving all of this some thought. Not nearly enough people think about backups, much less attack scenarios and disaster-mode protocol. 
@_date: 2016-04-22 05:16:54
Backups of wallet.dat files contain any of the addresses that were in your address pool at the time of the backup. I believe the default address pool is 100, though you can set it much higher. Point being, when you call for a new address it just spits out the next one from the unused address pool (which is very likely contained in your backup). 
If you actually found yourself in this situation the solution you've proposed seems like a bad idea. Setting aside the fact that racing an attacker to move your coins is an unlikely way for it to play out, why on earth would you want to continue using the same instance of bitcoin core?! Move your coins to a totally separate wallet that lives on an entirely different device and figure out how the hell someone got a hold of your wallet.dat.

It is exactly this sort of application that makes bitcoin so important. This, some game related application which I have no interest in, is what happens in open and permissionless systems and that is exactly what I "signed up for."

The beautiful thing is that consumers don't have to pick just one thing. And what's right for you isn't necessarily what's right for everyone. 
What I can say is this, we see good growth month over month. We see a high percentage of new customers come back a second and third time. We see people walk in and walk out in under a minute with bitcoin everyday. Do they pay a little bit more for that, yes. Do they seem to mind, nope. 
@_date: 2015-06-05 20:14:16
No. That threshold doesn't apply to money transmission.

Yes, you were scammed.  This is a pretty common one on Localbitcoins. I'm sure the rate was at, or even below, the market? The next best seller was probably listing for $20-$30 more, right?
Without using the built in escrow, you've eliminated the possibility of Localbitcoins being able to do anything. Though I would still recommend that you report the user through the support system so he can be blocked. 
Sad to say, he was never going to meet up with you. Check his profile, scroll down to the bottom where it shows the users other ads, how many cities/states does he list for in-person cash sales? Quite a few right?? Yeah... 
It is totally possible to have a great experience buying on Localbitcoins, but it requires using some common sense and a healthy dose of skepticism. Here are some other tips:
1. USE ESCROW
2. Pick a trader with 500+ trades and 100% feedback. Read some of their reviews and check their profile page for the average release times. 
3. Don't necessarily opt for an in-person cash trade. Moneygram and western union are typically priced very competitively, oftentimes lower than traders in your town. 
4. Follow the trader's instructions carefully. Any good trader will have clear step by step instructions. 
5. Don't necessarily pick the best rate. Pick one in the upper middle of the reasonable rates shown for a given payment method. If you want as close to spot price as possible, don't use Localbitcoins.
6. USE ESCROW
Edit: added step 5.

I don't know of a single state that, as of yet, defines Localbitcoins activity as money transmission. Perhaps you're thinking of the federal government. 
@_date: 2015-06-07 01:58:39
The services aren't comparable. You just end up comparing them. The bank charges a flat fee for withdrawing your own money from your account. Bitcoin ATMs provide a currency exchange-like function, and you won't find any currency exchanges that charge a flat fee. It's all a spread. 
@_date: 2015-06-14 07:42:37
95 cents
@_date: 2015-06-07 06:14:31
Your expectations are all wrong. You even recognize that Coinbase charges a % (as does anyone else in the currency exchange business), but you think it would be more *fair* for bitcoin ATMs to use a totally different pricing model. Fair for who? 
@_date: 2015-06-04 20:51:59
Apples and oranges. Your making the wrong comparison. Bitcoin ATMs are not comparable with banks. At least not meaningfully. To the contrary, bitcoin ATMs remove the need to trust a 3rd party custodian with you funds. That alone is worth something to a lot of bitcoiners. 
A better comparison would be currency exchanges, like those at airports. Next time you're near one look at the advertised spread. Its not as high as most bitcoin ATMs, but it's still significant. 
@_date: 2015-06-07 06:42:41
A 6% margin is too high for the consumers that pay a couple of points more than that in sales tax on most transactions. I think not fella. 
Also, just so we're on the same page about who's conflating what, my company runs 6 bitcoin ATMs in Colorado. I can appreciate that you think you've got it all figured out, but you're missing a lot pieces of the puzzle if you think a 7% fee translates to 6.x% profit. Complete madness.

As for the Amazon code, you could always report the fraud to Amazon but it probably won't do much good. At least not in the way of getting you your money back.
I would absolutely move on, but for my own sake I would have to spin it for myself. Instead of viewing it as a loss, I would have to consider the experience a valuable (and relatively expensive) course in the field of "Some shitty things shitty people do on the Internet."

This is what I mean. Apples = cash **withdrawl.** Oranges = Currency exchange. They are fundamentally different activities. Unlike a bank, where you would go to withdraw your cash from a company who actively profits from holding your money (and probably charges you for that privilege), a bitcoin ATM functions as a currency exchange. **Not the same thing.**

**Face palm** well that's it.  Are you registered with FinCEN as an MSB? Do you have an anti money laundering policy? A compliance officer?

Every bitcoin company has their own wallet implementation. They all handle incoming coins, change, UTXO sweeping, transfers, etc. in different ways. Essentially, they all have distinct characteristics and patterns that are fairly easy for any diligent observer to pick up on. Coinbase is probably among the most capable and diligent. 
@_date: 2014-08-04 17:59:21
I'm not sure that getting between fiat and crypto was meant to be the "feeless" part. Even the least expensive options still come at a premium; time, money, or both. Bitcoin ATMs save a great deal on time (assuming you have one nearby). And 5% doesn't look that bad of you would otherwise have to wire money to an exchange or use localbitcoins. Though I have my doubts about the sustainability of bitcoin ATMs too, just for different reasons. Also, expect that the fees charged will be reduced over time. 
@_date: 2014-10-15 07:04:52
As have I. And I'll be the first to say that there were a few issues. We were lucky enough to get them ironed out prior to launch. The main difference is that with the Lamassu, the operator is actually empowered to perform certain fixes. Up to and Including reflashing the system to a clean start. That said, I think it's foolish to expect any of these machines to be flawless. It's all too new and these aren't "real" atm manufactures here.

It should be obvious to anyone that has done their research (yeah, I'm talking about you, coinfire) that the various state regimes concerning money transmission may or may not apply to businesses dealing in digital assets. Cryptsy, like so many other businesses, is operating in a legal "gray area." 
They do maintain custodial control of user's funds (as far as I know), which probably increases the likelihood of the MT laws being applicable. But they could have also figured out a clever way to satisfy the various state laws by way of exclusion or agency. 
This article fails to point out the many ways cryptsy might really be "compliant." Instead it sounds like you called or emailed every state's money transmission authority specifically to kick up dust about cryptsy when you know that every state publishes the list of licensed money transmitters for your viewing pleasure.

Are you an oDesk freelancer that wants to get paid in bitcoin? Are there others like you?

I doubt oDesk has a negative opinion of bitcoin. I'm sure they can appreciate what bitcoin has to offer. I just don't think there is enough upside for them yet.

Here is the exact thing I say when paypal places a hold on incoming payments.
"So unfortunately paypal put a hold on your payment. I am unable to release the coins until paypal lifts the hold, usually just an hour or two, but up to 24 hours. You've got a few options though:
1: I can always refund the payment and you can cancel the trade. Usually any subsequent payments you make will be held for up 24 hours anyway. 
2: You can absolutely try giving them a call to see if you're able to authorize the payment and have them release the hold. I'd say that works about half of the time. (the other half they'll act like its not something they can do at all).
3: We can just wait it out. But we'd have to do that outside of escrow so that it doesn't hurt our average release times too much. If you want to go this route, please note that you'd be trusting that I will send you the coins when the payment clears - up to 24 hours. Please don't select this option if you are not comfortable with that."

"How can you convince oDesk to accept bitcoin?"
Already be paying tens of thousands of dollars to oDesk freelancers every month, consistently. Then tell them that you would prefer to pay in bitcoin, and that you'd be happy to sign a contract guaranteeing equal or higher levels of payments through their service. Hell, offer to hire the freelancers to implement the necessary changes.
"Why would they not do it?"
Because absent the kind of incentive described in part 1, there isn't enough in it for them at this point. 
Don't get me wrong, I love paying freelancers in bitcoin, and I do all the time. I just don't use oDesk.

Well it appears that I was wrong. Apparently there is a hefty premium on bitcoin in Nigeria, with most offers to buy bitcoin via Nigerian bank transfer offering anywhere from (the equivalent to) $475/BTC to $580/BTC. 
You may earn from 18% to 32% by sending her bitcoin and having her sell it for Nigerian bank transfer. Not bad at all. 
Of course it should be noted that these trades are anything but risk-free. If you go this route, make sure you use the Localbitcoins escrow system. In fact, you could take care of the interaction with the trader for your mom so you'd have a better sense of the whole thing.

Don't release the coins until the payment clears. At this point, given how pushy he's been, and your clear discomfort with the whole thing I would suggest refunding his paypal payment and asking him to cancel the trade. He probably won't cancel it, so just screenshot the refund confirmation and upload it, then wait to dispute the transaction with LBC once time allows. 
Then, once this particular instance is resolved, do considerably more research and think hard about whether selling via paypal is right for you given your risk tolerance and know-how. Accepting paypal for bitcoin can be profitable if you are able to effectively manage the chargeback risk. But if it would be a hardship to see this payment (and any others) disappear from your paypal account/linked bank account with no way to get your coins back, you shouldn't be trading via paypal. It doesn't sound like you've given much thought to those risks, so definitely take some time to do that.

As others have suggested, you should go straight for the bitcoins. 
But you should also buy one S7. As a matter of fact, we all should. That is the sort of decentralization bitcoin truely needs. Mining shouldn't be left to the few big players. It shouldn't necessarily be viewed as a for-profit endeavor either. In order to break the natural tendency towards economies of scale (read: centralization, censorship, etc..) it must not be viewed that way by everyone. Think of it as a hot and noisy perpetual powerball machine in the closet if it helps. But buy one without the intention of profit, but rather participation in this awesome experiment.

A U.S. taxpayer would complete a W2-G to declare the winnings as income from gambling. I'm not sure where you heard that the IRS doesn't enforce tax laws related to an individual's gambling income, but that's not something I'd bet on. 
The fact that the sale of bitcoin is also a taxable event in and of itself adds an additional layer of complexity. If your goal is to cash out your winnings to USD in a tax compliant way, ask an accountant.
Have 50k credited to your bank account isn't against the law. The bank will file a CTR (currency transaction report) with the IRS which your W2-G and capital gains declaration will explain come tax time. 
It should be noted that intentionally avoiding a reporting requirement by breaking a large sum of money into smaller pieces is called structuring, and it is federal felony. Because of this, it is more likely to attract unwanted attention from your bank.

Do we occasionally have chargebacks, yes of course. But so does anyone selling that kind of volume through paypal, regardless of what they sell. It's the cost of doing business.

I'm sorry this happened to you, but thank you for sharing! 
It sounds like you picked up on the warning signs, albeit in retrospect. I tend to disagree with Paxfuls recent push to have inexperienced traders rush to their platform to help provide liquidity. This has probably happened to dozens of people in the last couple of days, and many of the scams would have been identified and rejected by a more experienced trader. 
Gift card trades are peculiar and risky for a lot of reasons. They shouldn't be accepted by anything less than a professional (or amongst friends). There's a reason your 15% fee, which probably felt *greedy* to you, was vastly under most listings. It's that pricing is commiserate with risk. 
 
Again, thanks for sharing your experience. I hope it helps some others avoid such a fate.

It's ALL "at your own risk." 
Sellers that excel at risk management and fraud prevention are the only ones able to accept risky methods of payment, like paypal, profitably for any length of time. 
Escrow is to protect the buyer not the seller. Without it, scams would work in the opposite direction: sellers wait until they've been paid and disappear with the cash and the bitcoin. Of course with paypal those buyers would get their money back through a dispute. So escrow is just a good way to make newer customers feel safe during the trade. It serves as a legitimate buyer protection in Moneygram, western union, or otherwise difficult to reverse trades though.

It's a safe way to get your paypal account shut down. Fast. PPMC isn't supposed to be used to pay people for stuff. So if you're accepting it and then withdrawing to your bank account, kiss your PP account goodbye (and the money in it locked up for 6 months). 
Also, Moneygram wasn't meant for payments either, just sending money to family and friends. But at least you'll have the cash :-) 
@_date: 2015-07-19 00:50:14
If you're buying, don't sweat it too much. Just follow the instructions and make sure the money stays in escrow, and mark the payment as complete once it's complete. Don't pay a seller who asks you to do anything else, just cancel the trade. 
As a new seller I'd recommend something like Moneygram, where you can go pick up cash before releasing the coins.
Avoid quickpay indeed.

Here's the issue as I see it: Localbitcoins (LBC) has banned thousands of users for scamming and fraud in the past few years. In response to the countless instances of fraud, LBC beefed up the various levels of user authentication available: email, phone number, Facebook, IP address, real name, and identity documents. Traders accepting risking methods can set the required authentication level a trading partner must have in order to start a trade. More importantly, bans actually become worth something, albeit not much. By banning everything from usernames to real names and Facebook profiles from the site, the amount of fraud on LBC has steadily declined. 
Of course the mildly sophisticated scammers have a new account up and running and fully authenticated with someone else's identity before the old one even got flagged, but many would simply move on to the next easy target.
Paxful is THE easy target right now. Suddenly the many thousands of low level/intelligence scammers have a new wide open platform to abuse. It will take years of banning based on a wide range of criteria before Paxful will have weeded out a decent chunk of scammers. 
The following parameters MUST be available as filters for counter parties so that fraudulent users can be adequately tracked and banned:
- IP address 
- MAC address
- username (no more of this User1395 stuff)
- email address (option disallow known throwaway providers)
- phone number (option to disallow VOIP)
- Facebook, linkedin, localbitcoins, etc..
- Identity documents and real name validation.
- TOR and IP/Area code mismatch. 
The list goes on of course, but this would be a good start!

&amp;gt;This is just bullshit, sorry. 5% is a HUGE fee, of course you butters are deluded and love to pay fees.
I'm not making any comment about the specific funding options available to you in whatever country you live in. I'm speaking generally about the funding options available. And it's not really debatable. I just looked at the list and counted. I'm sure you could do the same thing.. 
I'm not sure what a "butters" is, but I don't think I'm one of them...

MAC addresses are admittedly tricky as they are not passed in the http headers. Nor are they silver bullets as they can be spoofed with relative ease. It's just one more thing that many will overlook.

There are a large number of sellers on Localbitcoins who accept this form of payment for bitcoin (and for significantly more than $100). I'm not sure how much business they do on a daily/weekly/monthly basis, but if you're considering it, your best bet would be to try it there first. Build a solid reputation (probably with some other kinds of exchange) and then migrate to the cash in the mail. See if it's popular.

For the past several years, I've thought that the world's economists would embrace the pseudo-real-world laboratory that cryptocurrency allows. Not  bitcoin necessarily, but more broadly, the ability to test various monetary policies outside of purely theoretical speculation by spinning up an altcoin with whatever features are of interest to them. 
Much to my surprise, I haven't heard of any such focus in economic research.

Short answer: no. Slightly longer answer: maybe, it depends. 
If one or both parties to the transaction are in the business of buying or selling bitcoin, as opposed to a casual user, hobbyist, consumer, etc. the side acting in a professional capacity might be breaking the law if they have not registered as an MSB and/or if they fail to operate according to guidelines specified in various laws.

Sell them. Buy more. Repeat. (Depending on your jurisdiction, this may be considered money transmission or money service business activity). 
It won't be a passive thing, you'll have to work at it a little bit, but the gains are more assured than with btcjam or the like. It also requires a bit of additional fiat capital to rebuy coins before volatility eats away profits. 
To illustrate: 
Set up a LocalBitcoins.com profile and post an add as a seller. Pick a payment method like Western union or Moneygram, whichever is more convenient for you. (WU buyers tend to pay a higher markup). Set your initial markup at about +6-7%. And sit tight, someone will open a trade eventually. Stay online/active (green dot showing).
Let's use a market price of $225/BTC, and a markup of 7%. Which means your 1.5btc are listed for ~$357. 
Localbitcoins will take 1% of the coins traded. So the most you can actually sell is 1.485btc.
At a 7% markup you should walk away from the trade with ~$357 cash. Assuming you can rebuy (or wait to rebuy, the price almost always goes back down a little bit) at least $350 worth of bitcoin while the price is $225 or less, you'll end that cycle with about 1.575btc and maybe a couple of $ in your pocket. Hopefully closer to 1.59. Do it again and you'll have ~1.65btc. Again for 1.736btc. 1.8232... 1.9144 .... 2.0101... And on and on. 
I've changed the numbers to reflect the additional 1% that will be spent on rebuying coins to continue the cycle. So a 7% markup is actually only increasing your USD holdings by 5%. And I'm assuming that you are putting your full USD holdings into each rebuy and resell. You could always shave off profits in one currency or another along the way. And there will be price movement that may eat into (or magnify) your btc gains throughout. 
Good luck. 
Edit: I lost track of the market price I started with halfway through the example. Changed numbers to make things consistent, used $225/coin and included the 1% to LBC and 1% to rebuy, for a total gain of 5% with each trade cycle.

At our bitcoin ATMs customers can generally receive between $1-$400 cash with zero confirmations. The software does consider a number of variables before issuing a zero confirmation redeem code though. They include miner fees, mempool size, propagation, and double spend detection logic. 
Between $401-$2000 we wait for at least 1 confirmation, and we've never had customers wait more than 2-3 confirmations for up to $5000 (though we reserve the right to). 
@_date: 2015-04-24 00:34:53
$1000 per day on average should be the mandatory minimum goal. And it should be doable in most cities. If a machine isn't hitting that goal after a couple months, consider moving it.
Are you really splitting the commissions with the host? 50/50? That's crazy unless they paid for half of it and put up half of the float.
I'm not talking about the "glory days" or month, as the case may be. There's almost no way they did that kind of volume anyway, certainly not something to base comparisons on. 
@_date: 2015-09-05 00:00:37
Of course that info belongs in your will. But this lets you add instructions to the service provider in a new industry where these things haven't necessarily been well thought out yet. 
For instance, my will would contain a very specific passphrase with instructions to contact xyz upon my death. Through this I can share that passphrase with coinkite along with specific instructions regarding the person or people allowed to present the passphrase along with whatever proof of death requirement I may want.

It is absolutely NOT illegal to keep cash in a safety deposit box at a bank. 
One bank, Chase, has recently said that their customers can't keep cash in their safety deposit boxes. That has nothing to do with a specific law, just one company's crazy policy. 
@_date: 2015-09-19 07:04:22

I think this will actually increase the availability of cash deposits for bitcoin purchases, albeit not anonymously. But I know a good number of traders who will offer cash deposits again as a result of this change - they'll be doing the heavy lifting. 
And it's still far better than Chase disallowing the practice entirely.

Like you said, this shouldn't be a problem at all. 
@_date: 2015-11-01 02:01:43
Basically, no. That kind of processing would shift all liability for chargebacks to the intermediary bitcoin seller, giving you (the merchant) irreversible funds in exchange for the buyers quite-reversible credit card payment. 
One question: anonymity from who? The buyer of the product? Or from the company taking a huge risk on your behalf?
I'll say this, if you were selling a product for $73 and were willing to receive closer to $58 in bitcoin for it, PM me. We can certainly work something out for you.

And sure, if indeed the network statistic, "bitcoins sent in the last 24 hours" was 100 million, you could phrase it that way. I would have said something like: bitcoins sent in the last 24 hours is 6.75x the total number of bitcoins. 
@_date: 2015-11-04 02:47:17
It means precisely that 9 million coins have been sent on the network in the past 24 hours. It doesn't mean that they've been transacted between different parties, it means that 9 million have been sent. It doesn't mean that 9 million "unique " coins have been sent either. 
Usually this number is closer to 1.2 million on any given day.

We operate a couple of machines in Denver. We have a Lamassu and a BitAccess in the field now. The local demand and market size will obviously play a big roll in how much business it gets. I would say that if you have realistic expectations and enjoy talking with bitcoiners and dealing with bitcoin - you'll have a blast.

Nothing can make it impossible to be held hostage, extorted, or killed for your assets. Certainly not a wallet that makes itself known. Locking the bitcoins somehow will just prolong the confrontation or frustrate your attackers  into killing you or those you seek to protect. 
The only tactic I can imagine being a useful is a "double layered" wallet (similar to the hidden OS in the late great truecrypt). So you can keep a balance in a visible layer, send that to your attackers and hope that they are happy enough with the score, while a hidden layer contains the rest of your funds. Perhaps a "duress pin" that activates your GPS and alerts the authorities and even sends the hidden layer funds to a preset emergency cold storage address could be used to send coins from the visible layer when facing coercion. 
Best not to advertise yourself as a high value target to begin with though.

Without establishing the identity of the buyer no service will be able to accept credit/debit cards for bitcoin purchases because it would result in too many chargebacks/disputes. Such a service would be mostly frequented by credit card and identity thieves who would be able to exchange stolen credit for irreversible bitcoin. Ultimately leaving the seller on the hook for the chargebacks with no way to get the coins back and no legal recourse against the perpetrator. Hell, they wouldn't even know who the perpetrator was.

This is simply not true. At all. To quote Satoshi's white paper: 
"Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model. Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot avoid mediating disputes... What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party."
Nothing about that (or anything else Satoshi wrote) should lead you to believe that bitcoin was meant to REPLACE fiat currency. It's absolutely an alternative system that works well for a certain kind of payment, but not all payment types.

I haven't had direct experience with most of these, but many of them aren't decentralized at all. They wouldn't work if they were (at this point). 
Bitreserve works though. Centralized for sure, but at least pretty transparent.

Setting up an account with them tomorrow. Hopefully have it listed for you guys by the weeks end.

It may well have something to do with the local trader functionality, but I doubt this is it. The local trader feature and the FINCEN ruling you cited are not exactly comparable circumstances. They are providing an escrow-like service (if anything), and accepting a fee doesn't make them a MT anymore than doing it for free. Bitcoin lets everyone be a money transmitter, the laws are not equipped to handle it. But mycelium is a software (maybe hardware) company. Not a MT.

Exactly! Most people have no idea what money laundering actually is. But in this scenario, the local trader feature could be used either by the seller as a step in the "placement" phase, ie turn bitcoins earned through some criminal act into cash to more easily place it into the financial system. 
The buyer could have robbed an armored car or try to pass counterfeit bills to the seller.
So yeah, now that I think about it, maybe some "risk" there. But probably not why they were removed from the play store.

My business is registered with FinCEN as an MSB. That said, I agree, the regulations are ridiculous. I'm not sure what "holding on to any funds" means to you. But it almost doesn't matter. The collection of fees is of no consequence. If I transmit money for free, I'm an unprofitable money transmitter. If I don't transmit money, but I charge for some software feature that happens to allow you to transmit your own money, I am not a money transmitter.  
FinCEN has also ruled that escrow is not money transmission as it serves a distinct purpose, separate from the act of money transmission. But offering "escrow" as a way around the BSA would probably be a mistake

Not exactly. It has been praised as working well for everything, a practice which continues. It doesn't work for payments where the customer doesn't trust the merchant. At least not without arbiters on standby. It doesn't work well for people who prefer anti-fraud guarantees or who may want the ability to charge back a purchase. It doesn't work well for the blind. 
Regardless of "how well" it works, it was not meant to replace fiat.
