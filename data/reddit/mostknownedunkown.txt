Honestly never thought about tax implications.. hmm. I don't know anything about tax in regards to Bitcoin

I wonder why? Security risk? I mean at 2$ a day even after a  year it's only going to be 730$.. its not a ton of money but a bit of a nest egg to start. Or is it because of the volatility of the Bitcoin exchange rate.. I'm thinking maybe it will be worth more by then perhaps. And if not oh well ��

I'm not against security and I'm all ears. I'm pretty new to Bitcoin, I just have a coin base account a blockchain wallet. Both of which I have solid passwords and other ways of preventing unauthorized login like text and email verification. I'm not to tech savvy but have a tablet laptop and android phone (1+1) .

This may be true, but either way I don't want to be looking over my back for the IRS because of this down the line somehow

Iv heard saving Bitcoin is a bit of a !mistake cause you will have to pay capital gains tax on it all at each different exchange when it was bought? I had the idea to start a Bitcoin savings but this swayed me otherwise

Thats pretty sweet, I'd be interested in this myself. Do you have to get paid electronically/direct deposit for this to work? Unfortunately the company I work for is stuck in the dinosaur age and still gives out snail mail checks @_@

Awesome I'll def do this, is there advantages of using mycelium as opposed to blockchain.info wallets? Cause I have the keys to that so only I'm in control over that as well in theory

And at 366 it's considered long term capital gains and is ,0%?

Clearly Bitcoin is being treated as a taxable property type commodity and what your proposing sounds like tax evasion, I don't want to be on any level of shady with the us government just want the correct info before I decide but have been getting alot of mixed responses from many individuals

I think I'd invest in one of these if I started to accumulate alot of Bitcoin as the price is quite high but iv heard great things about trezors from Andreas ant. I'm reading his new book the internet of money it's fascinating.

Cool man best of luck! Glad I'm not the only one that's thought of this sort of idea :)

You make a valid point and I'm not disagreeing with you but because it is so finite I'm not so worried with the risk. And yes the keys to the money is another concern of mine, so perhaps I'll send all the money I acrue at the end of the month into a block chain info wallet o have separate that only I have access to? Seems like a safe option. I implement pretty good security on there, I get the text on my phone and a verification number on email as well.

It's like 5 cents not 1$ a day lol
