I mean how do you encrypt the files?  I used to have truecrypt for that but now I don't know any software that does that.  Microsoft software is now trustworthy.
@_date: 2016-08-25 03:37:20
How do you encrypt those files?  No truecrypt anymore.

What about Monero?
@_date: 2016-08-23 01:27:23
Well At this stage in the game every company that starts accepting Bitcoin should know that It´s not going to boost sales.
They must do It because they are open to emerging technologies and they beleive that It is the right approach in the long run, both for them and for their customers.
Cheers to the early adopters, the ones that brave uncharted waters and Stick with It trough thick and thin!

Taht´s number one for the regular people.








Number two for regular people.




Those two points plus ETF for managers (that´s the bulk of the money) will drive Bitcoin. But I´d say two years, maaaaybe five.
That´s a consequence, I think.

Maybe the damage is done.
This is a shame because this was an obvious entry point for new people interested in bitcoin.
When they get here and see censorship, dictatorship, hidden scores, centralization of development with suspicious allegations and promisses, they are not only stay away from r/bitcoin but from bitcoin entirelly.
Would you get in a ship if you see the rats scrambling out of a smoking hulk, even as the party going on at the deck looks good?

@_date: 2015-12-27 12:11:59
This post only shows that the real "roadmap"  here is for a group of people, mostly bitcoin core developers,  force a "consensus", while they are being payd by a private company, Blockstream.
That is a major case of conflict of interest, and nothing is being done or said about it.
Coinbase is not alone going with XT.  Bitpay, Xapo and many other important companies.  Now It's their time to step up the game against this absurdity in the bitcoin world.

How about trying to convince new people into bitcoin if their transactions are not confirmed?  How is that going to inspire confidence?
@_date: 2015-12-26 16:22:52
It is when a group of people censor and dictates the development of an open project whithout discussing It openly, all the while being payd by a private company.

I could but that's not the point.  People that want to get bitcoin but don't know how should be able to get it by themselves in 15 minutes.
@_date: 2014-09-24 18:04:13
That is great, but I don't think that's the norm.
Here in Brazil we have a good exchange, mercadobitcoin.com.br, but we have to transfer money from the bank and sometimes it can take a while, from two hours to a whole day.  
But my mom is thinking, why don't I just buy it with my Credit Card?
@_date: 2015-12-15 15:00:12
I'm not buying any promises.  LN is still an idea and btc needs something done now.
@_date: 2014-09-24 22:06:03
I don't know, but it has to take 15 minutes tops.
@_date: 2014-09-24 22:24:12
Thank you for your post.  I agree that Circle looks very nice right now.  I hope they succeed.
Exactly, It should be a no brainer like using Credit Cards.
@_date: 2014-09-24 22:14:29
Android works great but mostly because google backed it up.  Besides on a UX perspective It's a knock of from IOS.  Jobs hated it because of that.

Brazil.  We have mercadobitcoin (that I use and It's good) and others, that I have never experienced. 
The process is not difficult.  It just takes too much time and has too many steps, specially for the novice user.

I'm  not complaining, I just think It's not ready for mass adoption yet.  It's close, though.
@_date: 2014-09-26 19:07:41
I think those are the best uses for BTC.  It´s not only to buy stuff on stores, but to transfer money, to anyone and anywhere 24/7.   And in the end BTC will complement Credit Cards.

a) I proposed it to her, yes, but should every mom have her own BTC dealer???  Like buying weed?
b) I didn't say it was a problem in BTC, but with BTC.
c) Coinbase is not worldwide.
The problem is that when someone wants to get some bitcoin, they should be able to get it fast.  Like Facebook in the beginning.  Oh what's that think about Facebook, let's see, then you create an account and you are on FB.

I'm saying that while being decentralized is very good, one of its drawbacks is that It's shoots in every direction.
One guy mentioned Android.  Maybe Android wouldn't be so popular if it wasn't for google.
In that line of thought maybe Paypal could be the company that could make it very accessible, at least in the short term.  Who knows?
@_date: 2014-09-24 22:39:15

We're at that stage today.  We are just not ready for a massive blowout yet.  We have to work this things out.

Ass to hand?
@_date: 2014-09-24 22:35:40
I've never seen one, but from what I heard they are doing more harm than good.  It gives you this form to fill out, then It takes your picture (yes, 1-2-3 FLASH!), than It gets your CC information or whatever then it actually sends you off for 20 minutes until they get authorized etc...
That process is too annoying for 98% of the people I know.  They will just ask "Why is this better than my credit card again?"
@_date: 2014-09-24 18:12:13
I actually think something like using Creditcards to get coins from paypal could be it.  But who knows?
Everybody has a PP account with a creditcard attached to it.  They would just go to the paypal website and add X BTC from their VISAs.  instant BTC!
@_date: 2015-05-25 21:55:14
Why?  I think they work fine.

There´s a common list of rules one should follow when storing bitcoins in a webwallet:
1- DON´T!  Bitcoin was MADE to empower people to their money, and making third parties unnecessary and risky.
2- CREATE A STRONG PASSWORD!  It must have at least 13 caracters (Upper and lower case and symbols).  Never write it down, never tell anyone.  You can use it on a wallet on your computer or a hardwre wallet.
3- BACKUP your wallet!  Follow the intructions for the 24 secret words, or save your .dat file on at least two usb pen drives and keep them in another house or appartment.  NO ONE is liable for your bitcoins if you lose them.  N-O  O-N-E.  If your computer crashes and you don´t have a back up, you lost them FOREVER.  It´s as simple as that.
4- TEST YOUR BACKUP!  Since there´s no way to restore your bitcoin without a working backup, It´s a good Idea to test your backup BEFORE your computer with your bitcoin wallet crashes down.  Remember, you will not have a second chance.
If you follow these rules you should be ok.
Trezor and Ledger are great options.  I´d trust Trezor for 30+ BTC.
@_date: 2015-05-26 01:11:56

@_date: 2016-03-24 22:33:50
Don't be silly.  Bitcoin is imploding as we speak.  A team of people has hijacked Bitcoin to transform It into BlockStreamcoin, which is in vapourware phase AND a centralized group.
@_date: 2016-06-04 18:06:51
Hello Fellow Lurker.  I'd buy a Ledger wallet, or a Trezor (safer but a tiny bit more complicated) if you have more then, say, 10 thousand USD.
Then Follow the instructions of the wallet, buy bitcoin from a reputable exchange, and when you have the bitcoins transfer a small amount to your Ledger/Trezor, just to get the feel for how It works and the time It takes to confirm.  Check the transaction out at blockchin.info for the fun of It. Then transfer the rest in as many transactions as you would like, to be more comfortable doing It.
I'd put a Mycelium wallet in my phone and send about 100 bucks to It for everyday use and to show people.  Trust me It's usefull.  And when you use Bitcoin in the real world you will see how awesome It is.
I'd avoid keeping It in a wallet in your computer.  Especially on a windows machine with internet connection.  But if you chose to do It use at least a 16 character letter/number/uppercase/lowercase/symbols password.  Anything less that that is just amateur time.  Be your own Bank.  Welcome to encryption.
About the 12 or 24 words that are your back up phrase in case you lose the physical wallet, you should write them on a book or somewhere safe, preferably in another place than your house (or the place you will keep the Ledger/Trezor).
Then sit down and follow the drama that Bitcoin is.
@_date: 2016-06-01 03:27:21

I guess I read too much Taleb and William Bonner and Kahneman to trust analysts.
Past behavior is not an indicative of future behavior.  And while I may understand there's some sense in It when you look at It, I don't think any amount of analysis about past behavior should indicate future market behavior.  
@_date: 2016-06-15 18:35:56














That's the example of an answer to a problem that is too technical, too complicated and too cumbersome for the mom and pop out there.  A perfect illustration of how NOT to answer an user.
We have to face that either we fix the UX of bitcoin or It will not get mainstream.
Also, there's the whole block size thing that should be increased at least to 2 mb while the BlockStream/core promises don't deliver, if they ever will.
These too things need to be fixed, or the price will fall back to under USD300 and only idiots will keep hopes in Bitcoin.  All the while making fun of other Cryptos that will blow past Bitcoin like Ethereum seems to be doing right in front of our eyes.
My consolation is that when Bitcoin fails, if It does for these reasons, BlockStream/Core will also have failed. 
@_date: 2016-06-04 23:02:34

Of course. It's just my opinion.
@_date: 2017-01-02 22:01:52


That point of view is exactly why It's cheap.  The minimun hiccup of Bitcoin and Litecoin is there to save the day.  It's just as solid, Not Blocksize problems and very fast confirmations.  Believe me.  It's not going anywhere.
@_date: 2017-01-20 15:14:04

The thing that I like the most was that I (as per usual)  asked the B&amp;B owners d they accepted Bitcoin.   They (sa per usual) did not, and I proceeded to sign up for Pay fast.  To my surprise THEY accepted it, so It was a very " It´s happening" moment for me.

I don't know this woman and I don't care, but exchanges suck.  The way a new adopter gets his first bitcoins is old school, intrusive, slow and dependable on the exchanges.
Opening an account, transfering money, wayting for the money to clear on the exchange, then finally getting your coins (at an unpredictable price, since there was a lag of two to three days). That's Not cool.

It's not such a blatant conflict of interest.
@_date: 2016-02-22 23:29:33
Blockstream IS the conspiracy, isn't It?   Since they gathered a good portion of the Core devs, and now they are working under Its guidance, to develop Bitcoin toward Its goals, Isn't that the real conspiracy?
And the silence in r/bitcoin about this major issue is so huge that It feels eerie and bizarre, as if It lived in another world and another Bitcoin, where everything was going Just Great!

I guess the good news is that It's an important thing to give much more "slaves" the opportunity of using It.  Bitcoin as It is has a lot of network effect still to go through.
Also, to the vast majority of the "slaves", a.k.a. mom and pop out there, Bitcoin is way to technical and risky to even try.  Paying an 8% fee to transfer money around the globe makes sense after you lose your money in the first try, because you did something wrong and there was no one to call for help afterwards.
We all understand your point, but It's naive to think there wont be any compromise.

2- transfer funds from bank to your exchange account.
3- when the exchange receives the funds, bid/buy the BTC.
4-get the trezor and create a wallet with It and electrum. 
5- write down on good paper with a good ballpoint pen your seed, given by trezor.  Keep it in the most secure way possible.  I'd keep two copies in different places.  This is the most important step.
6-transfer your Bitcoin from your exchange account to your wallet-electrum-trezor

I will donate 50 bucks.  They are awesome.  I went to Europe in the begining of the year and used HERE MAPS, an app that lets you download a map from a region (open street maps of course) and use your phone GPS offline, just like google maps.  It worked flawlessly and I didn't use any data on the phone.

I'm saying the people controlling Bitcoin are keeping potential investors away from It.  If you don't want to see that just take a look at the ETH Frenzy.  There's a lot of people that want to invest but BTC is being under control, you moron.
Take a look at the increase of popularity of this sub, for instance.  It parked at around 170k people about two years ago, also and then the hole Blockstream people took over.
Fuck 1 mb block, the problem is that A PRIVATE COMPANY IS RULING BITCOIN.
Is that clear, now?
@_date: 2016-09-08 23:15:35
This is amazing.
Bit coin needs these channels to get BTC to people and than e-commerce has to accept IT.
And of course It has to scale.  These Blockstream guys are fucking It up royally.

This whole regulatory thing is extremelly important.
This view raises a couple of three (actually four)questions:
-Does this aproach make It easier to tax, or tax more?
-Does this aproach male It easier to apply restrictions, such as in regular commodities trade restrictions?  What limitations does It impose and What doors does It leave open?
-Of course Bitcoin IS also a currency, but issued by no central authority and hence no one is Liable for It.  It is very hard to chase down.  They will have to create an abstraction as the enemy, like "War on Terror".  But then again, Does considering It a commodity make It more controlable/restrictable?
@_date: 2015-09-28 23:00:17

You must be new here.
Bitcoin is under attack in several angles since 2010.  It still stands.
It's going to get worse, much worse.
If It survives It will change a lot of the financial status quo.
Now let's just keep using It and spreading It.
Long live Bitcoin!

No "big money".

At least for now, no major price increase will happen, if one of those two doesn't happen.
But IF one of them happens, then moon.

Just wait.  
I have waited hours for a transaction.  It is not a very welcoming experience.
(Please note that I am not attacking anyone or taking sides.  Even though I want to see a block increase because I don't want to see transactions being delayed. I hate how blockstream puppets have been playing so far).

I'll read it and give some feedback.  Thanks for the idea!
@_date: 2016-05-24 21:35:55
Because of the size of the Blocks.  Bitcoin blocks manage a certain number of transactions and are closed at every ten minutes.  If a large number of transactions are put they just stand on line and are postponed to the next Block, the next one, etc... and It can take hours to confirm.
Litecoin volume is still low compared to the number of blocks, and every 2,5 minutes a Block is confirmed, so basically 100% of transactions get confirmed in a couple of minutes.

I'm not so sure how that could work, either.  Three days is a huge time in bitcoin-space-time.  That's some risk someone is gulping.
@_date: 2016-07-01 18:19:23
I think you are watching the movie that is playing and not the one that should be playing.  Your choice.  You say triple as if It was something.  We are talking about a two years period.  For a disruptive tech that has already spiked to USD 1200 in the past this is nothing.
Any growth that happen in the future, and some will happen, will be muffled by this cap imposed by core/blockstream.
@_date: 2016-07-10 01:25:08
Risky, yes.  But only first movers take the risk and make great returns.
@_date: 2016-07-22 14:34:27
A lot, if not most people here, have these toughts from time to time.  What if I had bought or sold at a specific time.
You can't  let It distract you.  We have as mutch opportunity NOW as we had three years ago.  Here are four that I think of:
- Bitcoin still has huge potential of going 20x the price today. Very risky as an invwstment, though.  But the general public doesn't get It yet, and this window migt shut down at any time now, I think.
- Today we have Ethereum.  Extremelly risky, and far from being a solid choice as a Cryptocurrency when compared to Bitcoin, duw to Its creation and code
- We have two anonimity oriented coins, Dash and Monero.  Dash was kind of pre mined so a lot of It is in few peoples hand, but works well.  Monery is still young but is awesome and very cheap.  I think they are important because KYC and regulators will take a lot of anonimity out of Bitcoin.  When that happens they will multiply their value.  Also the Bitcoin blockchain show traces of your past trades, which I think It's not good.
- Litecoin is still around, and It's as solid as Bitcoin.  iF Bicoin goes to the moon one day, Litecoin will follow.  Also greatlly undervalued right now.
These opportunities are still out there.
@_date: 2016-07-06 21:11:15
One problem that you may have is that the main exchanges in Brazil will have KYC policies and will register your buying.  Then you will officially own x amount of Bitcoin.  And maybe you should register that asset in your taxes next year.
You may encounter KYC in Mexico as well, so maybe there will be registrations or taxes there as well.  
Of course there's always localbitcoins, but It's just not as practical or safe for larger amounts.
I'm sorry I don't have an answer, but your problem is a very interesting one.  Please keep us posted on the results.

One piece of advice.  Always check the https lock on the address bar of your browser.  Once I made a typo and  typed shapeSHIT.io  which was an IDENTICAL site, and behaved just the same, but the address that you sent the Bitcoin to is a scammers wallet.  
We must be always on the lookout for scams.

@_date: 2016-07-10 01:42:27
My point is that some take risks and make a profit.  The second wave, as you said, come in heavy in the game with huge investments and do reap a big profit without the big rosks of the first movers.  But It,'s the first movers that are called crazy, while the crazy callers stand aside and critisize from the sidelines.  
One of my life motto is:  You always have many reasons NOT to do something, but you have to hold on to the one reason to do It.
@_date: 2016-07-13 03:01:15
Brazil has a very passionate Bitcoin community facebook page.  If you ask the guy at the street chances are he has never heard of It, but eventually one will say " Oh yeah I saw It in the news...It´s used on the dark web by criminals, right?"  but nothing more that what the media has fed him.
One thing Brazil lacks are places to spend or pay with Bitcoin.  But just like the rest of the world, brazilians will catch on to It.

Epic title.
I agree completely that we lost the scale of things.  The last two bearish years made people here very...uhmmm...passive (bending over to Core/blocktream and all), as opposed to agressive, "with impetus".
If the halving or anything else brings a bubble, with capital B, then we will see 4000 easily.  10.000 possible.  This is my speculation.  But there's a problem...
People are calling a bubble at 2k.  That's not a real bubble. They forgot or are muffled by the Core/blockstream that this under 1000 price is normal, that now bitcoin is less volatile, and growth will be linear, and all other sorts of noise.
We have had terrible price because there's a cap on Bitcoin.  Bitcoin as It is today is limited on Its capacity.  Seven transactions a second Is not even High School level. It's kindergarden level.  The fucking King is naked, guys, just look and see It already.
It's like when a Boeing engineer makes a change in a piece of an airplane and that change alone keep hundreds of terrible accidents from happening.  Nobody will ever know the importance of the change in the piece because the accidents never happened to begin with. 
Now here we are.  One good news and after another and we don't see the price really rising or any bubble or rush in the horizon.  Why is that? We can't see the exponentiality of Bitcoin, or worse, lost the idea of Its exponentiallity, because of a lack of a move that should have been made over a year ago.  And the movie that we see is that Bitcoin is "less volatile", Linear, controled.  We see what **is** happening, not what **should** be happening.
Bitcoin is exponential.  Lets not be convinced to the contrary.  There's still hope for the moon.  Just untie the rocket.
