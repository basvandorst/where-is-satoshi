I haven't been a regular on /b/ in quite a few years, but last I heard their new mods got a real stick up their ass. "If it fits better somewhere else then it doesn't belong here"
All conjecture though, so don't think I'm some authority on it.

This is irrelevant if you're applying a DCA approach.

This answers so many questions.

Why not just set a time schedule and a frequency, once you know how many intervals divide your capital by the intervals. If you want to invest at a non-varying rate that is.

Now reading that with proper context I think it’s pretty funny, my bad. +1

If something is exploitable it will be exploited, we should be searching out these flaws and solving the problems so that adoption can happen.

Pretty sure they usually discuss that on a different board there.

By that logic my car is worthless because I can't go buy a burger with it.

Whoops! 
Well, now I need space Arby's. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:18:58
At its closest possible about 180 light seconds, (3 minutes) and Arby's furthest 1,340 light seconds (little over 22 minutes). 
Edit: I meant "at its furthest" but I've gone to far now, Arby's on mars it is. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:54:15
Absolutely this.

Oh I gotcha, well I'm glad that's what I was already doing then. I thought you were saying there was a way to buy BTC with fiat through bittrex in order to let people buy in those dips when sites like coinbase are down. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:03:09
Silly newbie question, how can you buy BTC with fiat on bittrex? I thought it was just a crypto exchange. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:46:16
I don't really understand mining so I can't say much on that front, but for trading yeah it would definitely be a hamper. 
I would imagine it would be 2 separate markets, Earth and Mars (like US and EU maybe?), connected by an exchange of some sort. You could probably reduce the average time by placing the exchange server at one of the Lagrangian Points. 
The deficit between the markets due to the latency and different market forces would probably drive some effort into arbitrage between the two, which would drive their prices closer together.

I propose we marry the former and keep the latter as a side thing. Best of both worlds, right?

I’ve got some bad news for you, friend.

While outdated in the setting, given only this frame to work with it would be nice to have a sense of reference. However, we can likely assume that it is “a lot” from implied context. 
Still, I think that the sense of “wow, bitcoin became worth a lot!” Is a natural feeling and would still add to the total experience.

The portion of craigslist that is relevant to the same subject matter as why backpage has been seized was taken down in light of recent bills being passed.
