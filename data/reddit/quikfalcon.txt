I guess it was oddly placed for me. The dude is just feeling good about getting one whole coin. This is probably one of the few places he can say that like anyone cares. Then all he’s met with is paranoid opinions. It could have gone without being said.

So are people actually serious in this thread? I thought it was kind of a joke about the not sharing and painting a target...

Paypal actually froze $200 after I sold a few things on ebay to pay rent. Why did they freeze my money you ask? Because, my Drivers License, SS and Proof of Address wasn't enough to prove my identity. Although they ask for those things, they mean nothing now apparently, and only a 3rd party source (Credit Report) can vindicate you. It's pretty sad I must say, specially when I'm only 22 and didn't get my first credit card till a few months ago.

I am in the exact same boat. I did it at $9 roughly per BTC and now it's $17. Makes me cry. Then of course this is just waiting for my money to transfer to the account, which wont be done until Tuesday anyway.
