Any idea if Cash uses segwit addresses for these transactions?

Yeah, I will create an issue on the Github and post a link here once I do. Please let me know if my description is misleading or not precise.

Yeah, my problem is that I used the "wallet" feature to generate that address and send coins to it. And verifying the keys generated under the "keys" tab of that wallet yields a different address.

Sorry, by "automatically" I meant using the "spend" tab once email / pw credentials for the wallet have been entered.
My segwit address and balances show up properly. However, the public and private keys when "verified" point to a completely different address with a zero balance.
Using the "spend" tab yields this message upon sending: Error: 64: scriptsig-not-pushonly.

SO, I *should* have all that information. Can you recommend a method for obtaining the redeem script?
I get an "F" in googling.

As a blind person, I think this is a really cool project! The diagrams in particular will be the most helpful part to have represented tactically.
I also hope over time more bitcoin clients will become accessible to screen-reading technology like [this.]( Core is accessible via the command line, and Coinb.in works just fine, but it is a little frustrating that Electrum for instance is completely unusable because none of the content is made visible to screenreaders. (I believe this happens mostly because QT's accessibility implementation kinda sucks.)
Anyway, that's out of scope for this post... but this project is great and I am very excited to get my hands on the finished product!
