probably there isn't, because you can't know how many people lost access to their wallets
@_date: 2015-12-22 16:09:37
so, does that mean that Bitcoin is going to scale soon?
@_date: 2015-12-21 08:10:32
hmm.... alternative? worth to check

that's a joke?
@_date: 2015-12-01 06:05:51
Yes but it's not recommended, use a wallet you own it's seed (desktop, mobile, paper) if you can...
It's only safer if you don't know how to secure your own wallets yourself, and that's something you better learn.
@_date: 2015-12-22 16:12:08
both have many trolls?
@_date: 2015-12-21 08:25:33
yeah, I don't blame them. actually I'm really happy at how supportive they were on getting my balance out of their site. considering the situation
I'm just kind of sad
@_date: 2015-12-04 17:49:12
Good point
@_date: 2014-12-14 18:12:25
a big project like this needs very huge funds.. where to get it from?! I imagine the bot will need more than 1000$ in Bitcoin to make every redditor has to get at least 1 satoshi.
@_date: 2014-12-18 05:26:41
Ok, I'll take a note of this one.
@_date: 2014-12-09 20:18:39

your handle (username) is hard to read too..
let's see.. "eleven one one one one one eleven"? good name.
here's  111111 satoshi via @_date: 2014-11-20 11:48:56
I liked how this site works, I can see it's a Java version from Html's [Codeavengers]( but this one with voiceover so it's better.
here's my progress page:
for now I'm completing intro, "see you at the next problem" :)
@_date: 2014-10-25 17:49:31
Hopefully we'll do it.
@_date: 2014-12-22 17:01:45
I agree with all of this
@_date: 2014-12-14 18:09:19
Exellent, That needs a lot of work though
@_date: 2014-12-21 17:46:22


as someone lives **IN AFRICA**, I agree with this part.
@_date: 2014-12-17 19:36:32
I'm with you in the privacy issue.. the creators also warn about it too actually.. you have to be careful when using it.
@_date: 2014-12-22 17:25:22
[Eeeeeww!! shouldn't have imagined it](
@_date: 2014-12-07 05:20:16
will do
@_date: 2014-12-21 17:29:02
Ok, Endroused it.. it's always good to make more people educated about Bitcoin!!
@_date: 2014-10-25 08:28:56
and made to save all of that bother for micropayments... I'm sure it'll succeed we'll just have to hasten it's success.

"how can they ask their enemy help to fight another enemy? they'll inevitably turn against them!!"
that's what I always say to those of Libya that were supporting the "foreigns" who are fighting other Libyans.. sad story :(

Good, we need to make Changetip more secure.. Thanks BitGo™
@_date: 2014-12-20 07:32:10
not yet but they will!!
ah!! you mean another user data for them to [not sell](
@_date: 2014-12-10 13:34:47
because  people were generous enough to tip me &amp; I should do the same :)
@_date: 2014-10-25 08:18:08
Thanks, we need more active users for this group. I wanted to make a group for Libya but decided it's better to invite all arabs to already existing group.
@_date: 2014-10-27 19:22:55
I'm not the one who made it. &amp; sorry I don't know why... maybe I'll ask the admin?
@_date: 2014-12-17 20:41:31
I thought you're a male...
@_date: 2014-10-25 17:27:08
This was a tip, If you click 'collect it' on **changetip** comment you'll open your account with 111111 satoshi in it.
I'm sure will be the future of Bitcoin &amp; micropayments.. and I'll be happy if you become one of the early adopters.
@_date: 2014-10-25 08:07:40
I hope you get all the support you want, &amp; something similar happen in Libya.
@_date: 2014-12-22 05:44:22
I hate all of that.. the "previous" government forbidded civilians from holding of weapons,  now they are sold at the streets!! it's terrible...
but we "Libyans" brought it upon ourselves, (until now, a lot of people say "at leat muammar died" even when they are suffering).. I don't hate USA or NATO for that. I hate "that" it's happening. 
@_date: 2014-10-29 05:08:32
@_date: 2014-12-17 19:30:49
Totally agree if not for this part:


if you really love that person, you'll give them a "thank you" even if you know it wouldn't get noticed becuase you added the number of "thank you"s by 1.
in the internet where the number of shares/likes/comments is everything I'm sure "thanking" not a waste of time.
* But
when you love them give **unlimited likes**, a **mountain of comments**, &amp; a **dozen of shares**? where you want them to appreciate your "thanks".. this is where **really shine!!

I see the USD price of Bitcoin because I can't buy anything purely by Bitcoin right now.
most site sell for  in bitcoins..
so I HAVE to know how much it worths at the time.. when [I take jobs for Bitcoin]( I don't care how many USD it worths.. but when buying? we'll need more sites to sell purely in BTC and that will come in time
@_date: 2014-12-30 06:20:37
That means it IS accepted as currency right?
haters don't even accept that.
also while it could perform better this year.. I think it'll have a (way) brighter year in 2015.
@_date: 2014-10-24 20:50:47
good work doing like so.. can I get one too?
@_date: 2014-11-04 05:47:50
for one : I don't
@_date: 2014-12-22 17:28:06
they'll tax oxygen next
@_date: 2014-11-24 11:30:50
Or make it part of your tip.me page.. I think that's easier
@_date: 2014-10-25 17:46:56
This was a tip, If you click 'collect it' on changetip comment you'll open your account with 120 bit in it.
I'm sure will be the future of Bitcoin &amp; micropayments.. and I'll be happy if you become one of the early adopters.
@_date: 2014-12-17 19:39:31
bitcoin was also with less value for some time, I think doge will raise in value in the future so the same problem will be seen.
@_date: 2014-10-15 19:25:28
I think calculating in bits is better than with satoshi.... 
* 1 bit = 100 satoshi.
* satoshis to bits is like cents to dollar.
@_date: 2014-12-22 15:57:09
keep on HODL-ing ON then
@_date: 2014-12-18 10:43:39
maybe you're right about doge will never raise to BTC price..
it's really more suited to Micropayment. but I see Bitcoin too has a chance.
@_date: 2014-12-21 19:19:36
I'm from Libya now and we don't have "goverment".. actually we have 2 but neither do anything other than fighting each other.. it's a civil war.
when we were under the [tyranny government]( at least we knew we're safe.. now someone with a GUN steals from you IN FRONT OF OTHER PEOPLE and no one says a thing.. even police (for reasons I don't know) can't do anything about it.
bad government better than none at all.
@_date: 2014-10-25 17:46:29
great cause to buy "bitcoin" for your (still) unborn kid future!!
120 bit @_date: 2014-10-25 14:53:34
lol.. thanks for reminding me!!
70 bits @_date: 2015-05-12 16:26:01


I know that, I just thought... "doing it this time won't hurt" because it's faster
@_date: 2014-12-22 15:32:33
looks like a [normal calculator]( to me
@_date: 2014-11-24 17:44:00
good one
@_date: 2015-05-12 17:21:51
thank you so much :).. one of the reasons I drew this is saying this indirectly.. I really appreciate your comment.
also it was faster for me because I don't use the app in my phone.. something I should do soon.
@_date: 2014-10-25 17:03:47
the problem with Bitcoin is that most of people here don't know (and not interested in) how to buy from the internet at all. one of reasons that credit cards is hard to obtain in my country that there's no demand on them..
I want to change that, but no one will be interested in few bits (what I can afford) and currently bitcoin isn't mainstream so we can buy everything with it.

Thanks for putting all this effort in your Tipping Tuesday Threads :)
here's 2000 bits @_date: 2014-10-25 11:34:48
@_date: 2014-12-22 17:13:53
the MAX 20 million Bitcoins, should still have a value even when divided on all people on earth for each one of them..
let's say there's 7 billion person on earth (that will be different in future), then with [small calculation]( you'll find each person can have 0.0028 Bitcoin.. 
so about 3 mBTC should have a good value.. it's worth now is about 1$ !! to have strong future it should worth waaaay more than that!!!
@_date: 2014-11-20 11:54:50
I thought satoshi is a group not just one person.

.. actually I didn't try to get wallet because blockchain will takes (calculated) 160 hours to download for me, maybe I'm just a noob.. I think I'll try advice below and use electrum.
I drew this from what I read in this and other Bitcoin related subs (if someone didn't sync his wallet for months it'll take much longer time right?)
what's your internet connection speed? my interent is relatively slow compared to other countries so instant for you might means hour for me.
I'll be glad if you correct me if I was wrong.
@_date: 2015-01-11 17:31:19


I thought that too...
@_date: 2015-01-11 13:53:24
choose your levels of not acceptance:
* level (1) write complaining posts
* level (2) flood the internet with complains on every opportunity 
* level (3) hate bitcoin and don't use it ever
* ....
* level (99) try to invent something to remove the volatility from bitcoin
most of people are level 1.. if someone can reach level 99 then he may skip levels 2-98.

it'll be good if there's a big list of all the sites that accept Bitcoin as a payment method.
for now I just use @_date: 2015-01-19 17:26:26
didn't think of that.. here's 100 bits for the insight
@_date: 2015-01-31 13:24:06
good one!!
@_date: 2015-01-19 17:55:25
good one!!
but for:


I'm pretty sure Bitcoin will get the same treatment of cash in the future, and services like "paypal" will emerge for cryptocurrency.. what bitcoin excels at is how it's can be used like the "cash" and be sent from "I" to "U" without third party involvement, with little to no fees.
@_date: 2015-01-11 05:24:51
then "UP"

@_date: 2015-01-24 20:07:30
Very different©.
@_date: 2015-01-24 20:10:41
when you only have metered internet with few dozens of GB bandwidth and 512Kbit/s connection, you'll think ~~twice~~ three times before getting "desktop/mobile" wallet.
see my previous BTC comic strips here:
@_date: 2015-01-31 13:26:01
Then it'll be a war!!
@_date: 2015-01-19 13:55:32


This "soon enough" is at least months or years.. so you can't count on that in your website. this project ~~needs~~ will be better to send them some "bits" not some satoshis.
but anyway.. I still think it's good for involving people.. just can be better.
@_date: 2015-01-19 17:38:50
I meant.. it's like giving 2-5 BTC daily. after sometime the funds will run out right?
@_date: 2015-01-30 19:06:39
so.. this is collection of the articles that predict Bitcoin's Death?... ok
@_date: 2015-01-11 05:26:44
I think he/she refers me posting comics as "marketing", you can say that but it's the "good" type of marketing.. a win-win situation 
@_date: 2015-01-31 13:18:23


No!! Bitcoin greatness isn't in avoiding these services, it's greatness that they are supported but you can manage fine without using them!! that's the thing that no digital currency did before blockchain.


feels a bit guilty :(
@_date: 2015-01-11 17:35:36


you can't buy from outside USA
@_date: 2015-01-19 17:27:24
because someone can't give 1 satoshi every few seconds to 100,000 player at the same time!!
@_date: 2015-01-11 05:23:57


this is a good mindset just don't overbuy.. just in case the Bitcoin never goes to $1000 (then again even when it stays at $300+ it's good to but at $200+)
@_date: 2015-01-29 05:28:48
I have metered internet, so I pay in the number o GB i use &amp; the block chain worths almost a month of GBs... it's okay.. I learned that mobile don't download the blockchain so I'm safe

@_date: 2015-01-31 13:26:51


I totally agree with this
@_date: 2015-01-31 13:13:17
I think there's [Bitcoin price manipulation]( going on!!
@_date: 2015-01-30 19:15:05
as long as we believe in Bitcoin, it's price will rise again.
it's like a phoenix that once you think it's died it'll come back [^from ^ashes]( more lively than ever!!
* here's [my take]( on volatility..
@_date: 2015-01-19 17:31:05
speaking about Microsoft acceptance of Bitcoin.. is it still US only?
@_date: 2015-01-24 20:24:19

Bitcoin also used for charities &amp; micropayments.
@_date: 2015-08-14 08:13:58
It depends on the users who buy &amp; sell Bitcoin, and the price they buy/sell at, But I don't see the price of Bitcoin as a problem. since it'll eventually go up VERY HIGH... or go down VERY LOW. (I'm betting on the first)
@_date: 2015-08-03 21:51:52
so someone just tipped you? or do you want to tip?
@_date: 2015-08-03 22:00:54

Great idea, I have them my backups.
by the way, posted this on zapchain: 
@_date: 2017-05-25 04:48:28
I recently moved my Bitcoin to waves, part of it was greed (the waves was increasing up until yesterday)...
But I believe in waves so much that even if waves drops back to $1 again (I moved my BTC at $1.8) I don't think I'll regret it (But below that and I'll be panicking).
@_date: 2015-03-13 04:58:59
then it fell again :(

@_date: 2015-03-19 04:44:55
yes.. and they have bots for many social media sites too..
also there are subs who banned changetip bot, so don't know if it works in those..

I don't consider this bribing, just advertising.. because in these days every company is doing this, if they don't they'll be at disadvantage.
If I hate a company I wouldn't take their $5, or at least won't love them just because of this. if they can buy someone with $5 then that's 'his worth' not the problem in the company.

[waves is a platform]( where anyone can create their own token (like counterparty but better) .. it's made to be used easily by people who doesn't know crypto. and all of waves tokens are traded on an DEX (Decentralized EXchange accessible inside the wallet).
In the last three days it's price gone from $1 to $2.5 and it doesn't look it will stop at that!!
@_date: 2015-03-17 20:58:23
most likely
@_date: 2015-03-13 18:41:38
@_date: 2017-05-24 17:26:40
Also if you have many waves (more than 1k, prefer more than 10k).. you can LEASE them, LEASING is like Bitcoin mining. as waves transaction fees are disturbed to all those who Lease their waves depending on the amount they leased.
But the tokens that in Leasing can't be traded unless withdrawn from Leasing.

@_date: 2015-03-17 15:46:02
oh.. understood
@_date: 2015-03-12 18:27:38
because new Bitcoins are created everyday, it's called inflation.. the only way for Bitcoin price to go up that the demand on it goes up faster than new Bitcoins creation.
* More users who buy Bitcoin = Price goes up..
* The same number of people buying Bitcoin = price goes down slowly
* less people = price goes down faster
* if People don't buy Bitcoin anymore = Bitcoin price will crash maybe to even $10 or $0.0005
@_date: 2015-03-18 18:13:57
yeah.. it's an accident

while The Price isn't really important now (for some people) it will be.
In the long term, for Bitcoins to fulfill the worlds needs (when it becomes mainstream) then every one bit should worth $1 by today's standard.
I can't lie and say the price don't matter for me, But I can manage when the price goes this low, I know ^read: ^wish it'll go up eventually.
@_date: 2015-03-18 17:09:20
yeah.. the problem that if you typed the lowest amount wrong it'll take the other amount.. 250Bits is wrong form of "250 bits" so it took Pizza...
wait does changetip really have "revoke tip" feature? last time I checked they didn't have it
@_date: 2015-03-18 17:07:46
no.. it's 250 bit written wrong.. so changetip didn't see it and tipped the other amount in the comment which is "pizza"
@_date: 2015-02-10 05:13:57
so when all the new blocks are mined? the fees of Bitcoin transfer will become higher to increase the incentive?

many people supporting one of the fighting groups &amp; hating the others. these effect our lives but we still manage living (somehow) normally.

@_date: 2015-02-02 05:44:25
good advice. thanks
@_date: 2015-02-09 19:06:33
Thanks, still trying to understand it.
you mean it's like ISBN which you provide with your Document so the others can confirm that it's yours? if so how they can confirm it?!
@_date: 2015-02-01 13:30:19
great Idea to do that !!
@_date: 2015-11-03 04:02:19
messaged them.. they said "eventually".
@_date: 2015-03-17 12:25:42


But that also means you can't get your Bits if the service you use gets destroyed 
@_date: 2015-02-02 22:16:55
since I'm Libyan using Bitcoin.. I think it already is!!
@_date: 2015-02-21 06:43:21
Please If anyone from **Libya** read this!! **PLEASE LET ME KNOW**!!
@_date: 2015-02-05 22:03:37
I'm pretty sure there's many servers are unlikely to go down at once, also "I think" you can move your electrum wallet to another using the 12 word seed. right?
@_date: 2015-02-03 19:10:29


@_date: 2015-03-12 18:21:00
@_date: 2015-03-10 18:29:56


^ The real problem as I see it.
@_date: 2015-02-01 18:21:49
They do? if abandoned can it still be used?
@_date: 2015-02-05 22:01:10
Thanks :) I'm making [a comic]( too.
@_date: 2015-02-17 15:46:23
people seems like playing MMOs all the time.
@_date: 2015-02-04 08:14:00
I see a lot requiring **python** in @_date: 2015-10-25 15:16:09


Yeah, it'll take...
I wish people be more optimistic, and work for the country not against themselves.
@_date: 2015-02-21 10:24:17


me too.. but even if it gets that low (and after the fatal flaw is fixed) that's what I think will happen
@_date: 2015-02-02 11:30:12
Great, soon it'll be global!!
Is there an announcement Link for this?
@_date: 2015-02-07 20:25:18
Bitcoin... Dogecoin difficulty is 14 gigs.. I think?
@_date: 2015-02-21 10:29:08


you know? I like this sort of people.. live by their own terms. don't care about what other people are using... I like Bitcoin because it makes that easier.
@_date: 2015-02-07 05:11:05
why I didn't think of THAT...
to my defense I was reading it from a website when I wrote it..so....oh well.  I'll try to focus more next time.
@_date: 2015-02-01 18:21:14
@_date: 2015-02-16 05:44:05
I did too :)
@_date: 2015-02-21 10:06:04
1000 bits proved!!
But I'll still use addresses for jobs and things like that.
@_date: 2015-03-09 13:12:10
I can't blame them.. the word 'white paper' looks professional.. the problem that they don't know how to write one. 
@_date: 2015-03-12 18:08:31
me too... [^don't ^tell ^anyone](
@_date: 2015-02-02 15:54:57
Happy that you're here to answer questions, as mentioned the peoblems... it's grey area for "normal" Bitcoin users.
@_date: 2015-02-11 20:39:34
you can't quote something you "just" said.
the quotes come when someone says something interest another somone so they put the words in **" ^^quoting ^^marks "** to indicate that they aren't their own words.
@_date: 2015-02-02 16:05:36


me too.. but this still an option and I want to see where it's going.
@_date: 2015-02-01 15:08:14
they want to photoshop the .gif to make the woman donate BTC instead of coin.
@_date: 2015-02-01 14:57:36
hmm.. ok.
because I saw Electrum in a small SPV wallets list
@_date: 2015-02-16 05:38:58
so who are those superheroes will be?
@_date: 2015-02-08 13:20:41
I think it means even if the Bitcoin as a currency failed, other currency based on it's technology might/will succeed!! 
think "what if Bitcoin price smashed &amp; no one used it anymore, but other altcoin is still stable &amp; strong".. something like that.
@_date: 2015-02-01 15:51:05
yaaaaaaaay!! Libya is the 18^th with BTC equivalent of 253,115.27
it's one of the few lists Libya isn't one of the last once..
@_date: 2015-02-17 14:24:24
it "just" suits some people..
@_date: 2015-02-11 18:33:00
Here's 250 bits from me ~ @_date: 2015-10-28 03:22:43
@_date: 2015-03-13 04:50:52
it was?!
@_date: 2015-02-10 08:31:31
does that mean there'll be only 1 transition per 2 seconds?
@_date: 2015-02-09 19:07:18
thank you, I look for it.
@_date: 2015-02-03 19:15:16
I'll be happy to do something if I can &amp; know how to promote Bitcoin better.


maybe because Bitcoin is known as **trustless** currency?
@_date: 2015-02-11 18:32:27


some of them..
I'm not really a writer, but I advice you to publish a free e-book that will get your name known. you don't have to do a big research for it.
@_date: 2015-02-03 19:57:23
I still call that acceptance of Bitcoin.. even if partly
@_date: 2015-02-28 11:24:42
for those who like changetip, you can see my post and maybe help with it?
@_date: 2015-02-05 15:19:04
no.. I can see it's not you too.. right?
@_date: 2015-02-21 11:21:19
good one!!
@_date: 2015-02-02 12:47:51
Thanks, didn't thought you'd tip me since I already use Changetip..
@_date: 2015-02-05 15:36:11
@_date: 2015-02-21 12:03:00


you have a good point here, didn't think of that.
@_date: 2015-02-21 10:11:02
sorry... I thought you were changetip user.
@_date: 2015-02-02 11:02:23


the funny thing that it's true
@_date: 2015-02-07 06:41:48
you better contact them about it
@_date: 2015-02-07 04:49:19
maybe.. did you find one?
@_date: 2015-02-05 22:07:01


yeah... for some special cases the Bitcoin is way better than money ^read: ^@_date: 2015-02-01 15:46:52
Don't use a wallet more than once...?
tiring &amp; not a fool proof, but someone must be really desperate to follow your wallets to reach your offline one.. ... maybe
@_date: 2015-02-15 13:28:40
The sarcasm power!!
@_date: 2015-02-03 16:01:45
Not Libya, but I still wish it'll be.
I think it'll be USA, it already have many Bitcoin services
@_date: 2015-02-21 15:17:39
:) loved what you said!!
@_date: 2015-02-05 22:02:44
Don't know.. but I think it's not considered a node at all. hope someone correct me if I'm mistaken.
@_date: 2015-02-10 08:36:46


I think it's not necessarily, even if dollar value becomes less.. then BTC price in other currencies will stay the same. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 19:08:56


I think
@_date: 2015-03-17 12:21:21
pretty sure Libya have less than 5 Hundred.. I'm one !!
@_date: 2015-02-28 11:24:45
2nd !:}
@_date: 2015-02-02 16:32:31
here it is: 
copy &amp; past.
@_date: 2015-02-09 20:13:22
Ah!! I think you're right. thank you
@_date: 2015-02-21 06:59:43


0 confirms? that can happen?
@_date: 2015-03-18 17:20:43
you don't use changetip? yeah all you said is true except the last point which isn't:


the tip just don't go through at all.
@_date: 2015-10-26 04:19:11
great to know
@_date: 2015-10-30 14:55:56
but what's the average?
@_date: 2015-10-17 15:23:17
Keeping my spirit up.
@_date: 2015-02-02 16:11:05
it can possibly happen.
@_date: 2015-10-26 04:18:47
Wow!! never thought people in Europe would have the same situatuion.. especially france
@_date: 2015-02-09 19:17:53
hmmm.. it seems existence proving isn't free.. 5mBTC I think it's fair but I wouldn't test with it.
@_date: 2015-02-21 11:19:17
Wow!! that's...
@_date: 2015-02-05 10:28:11
answered it. 
but I wonder who will check "i use bitcoin to buy drugs" answer.. I mean even the ones who do wouldn't check that!! ....or maybe?
@_date: 2015-02-21 12:03:45
then sell them at $1,000,000 a piece?! that's insane.. ~~but somehow smart~~ and stupid
@_date: 2015-02-02 14:03:36
why I think most comments here are trolls?
@_date: 2015-02-21 11:21:04
no you mention it... I felt bad too.
@_date: 2015-10-18 03:50:54
I'm in tripoli, the gov.? you can say it's not existant... but the security.. well some people have it hard and some people (like me) are ok, just don't get away from home at night, there are car bandits.
it seems there are people who want revenge from what happened in 2011 (from both sides), so if they think you killed someone in that war you're pretty much "wanted" these days.
@_date: 2015-02-04 13:03:09
since Bitcoin is centerlized VS only centerlized payment methods? there will always be a place for it.
@_date: 2015-02-02 16:26:44
the post needs some editing, maybe I can do that for you?
@_date: 2015-02-21 12:00:32
yeah.. I'm sure so
@_date: 2015-02-17 14:32:08
yes.. I know. 
I just found it weird that all these accounts say the same thing at likely the same time.. maybe they're all fake but why someone will bother?
@_date: 2015-02-05 21:48:58
a satamoto?
@_date: 2015-02-11 18:15:23
Don't think so, but good!!
@_date: 2015-10-27 22:01:28
will cost someone else average of $500 so... you're not as bad case
@_date: 2015-10-25 15:09:04
Thank you very much!!
I'll think about joining the forum
@_date: 2015-02-09 19:50:13


for some reason I like to see this sentence..
if you think on it, it's true because for the BTC to be enough for 7 billion person on the earth 1 bitcoin must be about 1 million dollar.. so in a long term either it fail miserably **OR** gain price vastly!!
@_date: 2015-02-02 12:37:59
and those who have?
@_date: 2015-02-11 18:20:10
Always remember: 
* check the **"Email" of sender**.
* check the content, if it's too good to be true then most likely as scam. **especially if you weren't expecting the message**.
* Don't click links unless you're very sure, when receiving invite messages from a website it's better to go to it directly instead of clicking Email links
@_date: 2015-02-01 14:04:48


STILL looks delicious
@_date: 2015-02-24 18:20:49
Now I feel sorry I didn't do Tipping tuesday, today...
@_date: 2015-02-01 15:05:09
I advice you to learn about Bitcoin first, you can ask the same question in since they more likely to help.
sorry for your brother
@_date: 2015-02-01 06:50:23
oh ... nevermind
@_date: 2015-03-10 18:08:56
Don't worry.. I'm Libyan and everyone I talked about Bitcoin to says "I'll look into it" with faces clearly says, they probably wouldn't.
I'm pretty sure they'll call you crazy if you said that in a company in Libya.. so don't worry &amp; be proud. one day they'll see it the same way as you..
@_date: 2015-02-08 08:41:47
great Idea.. &amp; I'm sure it's very possible !!
@_date: 2015-02-05 15:34:13


Me too. I also agree that these shortcomings will disappear but don't know when.
his last statement was something like.


I partly agree with that, the Bitcoin wouldn't replace money for a (long I assume) while.
@_date: 2015-02-14 16:42:10
glad or you!! 
hope to get there too!!
@_date: 2015-02-21 11:20:21
No too... I think dogecoin will have it's uses that's different than bitcoin.. don't know about LTC though
@_date: 2015-02-03 17:37:14
yes, I think so too.
@_date: 2015-02-26 15:28:53
I figured that must be it.. but my respect for him only gone up after reading this
@_date: 2015-03-12 18:09:50
Thanks, still trying to improve my drawings [^(have manga too)](
even though I care much about the price, I know it's not important for Bitcoin.. being stable is better than going from very low to very high to low again.
@_date: 2015-02-16 05:37:02


I can't say I'm not like this too.
@_date: 2015-10-19 14:41:53
sad truth ^
@_date: 2015-03-09 13:10:38
I buy them all the time, [not a big deal](
@_date: 2016-07-03 16:03:54
1 full btc
@_date: 2015-02-05 15:35:16
tim worst all?! thats... just interesting.
@_date: 2015-03-13 04:57:11
it's bad for the health.. and mental health.... aaaand soul.
@_date: 2015-02-09 14:28:22
I agree
@_date: 2015-02-05 14:25:12
Is that you?!
@_date: 2015-02-03 15:59:02
Hi~ I'm a Tuesday Tipper too mostly on @_date: 2015-02-07 04:50:35
yes.. what he said
@_date: 2015-02-07 19:57:13
This picture from "Bfgminer" using scrypt"
Can you explain as many of these letters and numbers mean?
I'm very very new to mining and don't want any profit.. I'm ok with losing money if I'm doing a progress but I don't even know if my "PC" is just doing calculations without results.
@_date: 2015-02-09 19:08:19
so if Bitcoin failed, the Blockchain will fail too?
@_date: 2015-02-09 19:06:55
@_date: 2015-02-21 15:16:17


don't know.. I just said that after someone said "bitcoin will reach $0 in 5 years"


I don't disagree with what you said
@_date: 2015-02-10 07:53:14


oh.. didn't notice that..
@_date: 2015-02-07 04:50:20
hey!! at least I learned right? :)
@_date: 2015-02-05 21:59:33
Thank you all for the info.
@_date: 2015-02-02 22:00:45
since I did not find any announcement for this feature, I think they are just testing it out. or maybe found a bug.
let's hope that "it" appearing wasn't the bug in the first place...
probably it would return in no time. take my word for it!!
@_date: 2015-02-02 16:10:27
except Dogecoin
@_date: 2015-02-07 16:18:02
That's... depressing...
@_date: 2015-02-02 15:58:01
I think it's a good idea, but not in the spirit of trust-less Bitcoin.. just like how Coinbase makes it easier to buy Bitcoin but defies (almost) any spirit of the trust-less Bitcoin itself.
@_date: 2015-02-02 11:23:14
yes, while it's still limited help... it may be hard for some people to convert BTC into cash for everyday use.
@_date: 2015-02-02 13:00:54
didn't know that Bigfish accepts Bitcoin, Let's see if I can buy "Diner Dash 2"
@_date: 2015-02-04 05:09:41


then you're right
@_date: 2015-02-10 10:11:16
fffffffffffff *blood from mouth*
@_date: 2015-02-01 06:47:01
isn't this only works on ?
@_date: 2015-02-15 05:33:46
and it would be played by Altcoins or testnet Bitcoins!!
@_date: 2015-02-02 11:10:44
I feel sorry for you.


I think Libyan people like me will get the same treatment.
@_date: 2015-02-02 16:34:44
but [****ing]( is $%@ funnier!!
@_date: 2015-02-21 10:23:22
totally agreed..
@_date: 2015-02-17 18:26:39
wait wha...
@_date: 2015-02-21 11:22:58
But... but.. b- **we are screwed** *X(* !!
to my defence I thought fatal means hard to fix.
@_date: 2016-07-03 16:03:21
yes I think I'm addicted... I can't even stop using faucets even though I know I don't earn much from them
@_date: 2015-02-01 14:07:02




@_date: 2016-07-03 16:12:09
Have the banks started using Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-02-01 13:31:27
*~ have a Happy day ~*
also looks delicious
@_date: 2015-02-21 12:13:56
hahahha... you mean $7.5 cause I will take half of them.. ~~I'll~~ we'll build a new age of Bitcoin!!
@_date: 2015-02-02 16:12:20
the problem is you're not exactly wrong
