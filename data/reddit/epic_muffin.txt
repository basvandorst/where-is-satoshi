I think we still need some more proof because you just made me assume you stole it even more. Please provide the credit card number that you used to pay for this Ipad including your expiry date and CVC code or be forever thief.

So its settled then. 
Thief. :)

Before what attack? Kraken has been shit for years.

The red are buy orders currently on the houbi market. Green are sell orders.
If someone where to sell 15k bitcoin to the market right now the price would go down to 2700. 
This made me remember back when we slayed the bearwhale. Good times.

The only thing kraken EVER has had going for it is its banking connections. If you wanna cash out its a good choice. Other then that. Compared to the options. Absoulute shiet.

Sure. Its shittier now. But kraken has been a shithole since they launched.

Not really. TA is useful because people use TA (especially in crypto). Does that mean you'll get it right everytime or that news arnt important? Not at all.
TA has big effect on especially cryptocurrencies. Denying it just shows you havnt done your homework. 
Roulette tables differs because it does not matter what your other players are betting on. Knowing what other traders are betting on is huge however.

You think sending emails where easy in the beginning? 
Calling a new technology a failure because its "hard to use" is one of the stupidest reasons to do so. History will show you that.
If you think it is hard to do today you have no idea what a buttfuckery it was just a few years ago.
Eventually you will probably be using bitcoin without even knowing about it.

I'd consider 6k to 3k a very strong move wouldnt you?
@_date: 2019-04-26 10:23:09
Buying bitcoin is all about knowing when to buy it. You wait for it to bottom out.

Ah shit.. Thanks man. Edited.

As with all things these days.. It's mostly a loud minority that thinks that way about you i can promise you that! 
Edit: Minority! Not majority..

Meh, maybe that goes for you but it is not the case for everyone. I spend btc every other day. My friend got himself a limited edition Audi R8 when btc was around 3k and so on. Everyone has a price where they will start spending instead of hodling.

I cannot remember the exact quote but did he not say something like "That will be my gift to you all" regarding his 1 000 000 coins? Indicating that he never intents to use them. 
Altho i realize this could just be something said to keep everyone calm untill the day he decides to sell. 
In my opinion those coins will never move. They are to be considered destroyed in my eyes.
As soon as any 0.000001 btc moves from any of those adresses the whole system would come crumbling down before the transaction even got confirmed. 
You dont invent something like bitcoin with the intent to make yourself rich. 
You do it because you want to change the world.

This shows the similarities better.

Thanks! If only i had kept going with bitcoins back in 2009 when i used it for buying weed... :( Better late then never!  
@_date: 2013-11-21 20:22:39
If one only buys bitcoins without cashing them in there is no tax to be payed right? 
What would stop me from cashing them out in Sweden instead?

If one is outside of the U.S? :) (Coinbase was U.S only)
Norway to be more precise.
