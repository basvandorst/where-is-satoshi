You realize that you can send bitcoin via GDAX completely free, right? Coinbase is literally eating the cost of fees for anyone who uses gdax to send their bitcoins.
If you believe that segwit will actually make transactions cheaper, it might be in their best interest to do so.
However, it's completely possible that either 1. Segwit won't make transactions cheaper and 2. it's more profitable for coinbase to pay the fees than to spend the time and take the risk to transition all their wallets to segwit wallets.
Science is not just a body of knowledge, it's also a way of thinking. You should try it.
@_date: 2018-01-06 04:24:38


That's actually not true. It doesn't have near the volume of bitcoin, but if bitcoin had larger blocks, fees would be minimal.
The problem I have with bch is that there isn't any real reason for me to use it over ltc.
However, bch has some strong marketing, something that LTC really lacks. For this reason, I have some bch as part of my portfolio.
But I have a little bit of everything in my portfolio. Never go full retard.

No. The asics required to profitably mine bitcoin today don't even exist yet. They're currently being developed and people have already preordered them.

Yeah, it's a pretty clever technique. Paint a picture of the amount of energy it takes to produce fiat money, but then omit any hard numbers that would actually provide a means of comparison of energy consumed to transact bitcoin versus fiat.
Most because this would be very difficult. You could probably provide reasonable estimates on both sides, but due to the massive amount of money that moves around on a daily basis, slight inaccuracies in estimates probably would produce extremely large discrepancies.

I think Warren wouldn’t consider savings or reserves an investment vehicle.
I would also bet that the majority of people who own bitcoin purchases it with the idea of reselling it some day for more than they bought it for.
Dollars placed in savings, on the other hand, are done so typically to cushion the blow of unexpected life events. Excess savings are typically invested or used for large purchases like cars, vacations, etc.
With all that said, investment is more of a mentality than it is a label to categorize.
Bitcoin is more similar to a commodity than it is a currency, in my opinion. But not everyone feels that way, and there is nothing wrong with that.

In reality, the confidence in bitcoin over the next 5 years will be  relative to other investments. If bitcoin stays stable while the market crashes, people are going to be happy to have held bitcoin. If the market does well and bitcoin stays flat, people are going to think they should have had money long in the market.

No one has ever been able to demonstrate long-term success attempting to time the market. DCA has proven time and time again to outperform market timing over any statistically significant sample size.
The TA crowd and the fools who believe them are simply making guesses and then telling everyone about it when they get it right. It's complete lunacy and bitcoin/crypto has proven no different.

The US retail investment market is larger than the next 7 countries combined. Coinbase is fast and easy for that market, and that is significant.
There is room for other players to come in and fill their niches, but you significantly over-estimate how important it is to have market share of US markets versus global markets.
The place where coinbase lacks is access to alt-coins, which is a big deal, but still not significant enough to see a sudden rush of "new" money into crypto.
Boom and Bust. Just like before, it's likely we see a slow exit of money from the space and the next boom will depend on if cryptomania happens again.
If you believe in the long term success of bitcoin, just use dollar-cost average.

There is a small flaw in your plan. It relies on another price boom. If you don’t already have a decent income, you’re not going to get access to much credit. And those who do are going to be the ones who track you down and shatter your knee caps.
But pretend that you get access to 10K credit. What’s next? Bitcoin booms again? Ok. So now you have 100K. How long is that going to last you? How you going to buy a house or anything for that matter? Creditors will come after you and seize that shit.

I never made the claim that it was 50/50. It is a fact, however, that it might pay off or it might not.
I'm also not sure what random has to do with this. It's not random, but it is unknown. This is the case for all markets.
And I'm not saying that people shouldn't take risks, but I would consider the majority of people gambling with student loan money to fall in the category of foolish, not in the category of taking calculated risks.
I "gamble" on bitcoin, but I'm an engineer with a steady income and very little liability. If I put $20,000 in bitcoin and lost half of it, I'm still going to be able to feed myself and my family for the next year in the event I lost my job.
College students, by and large, have an uphill battle to climb when it comes to financial independence. 
And trust me. This is coming from the guy who made the decision to pay off $20,000 in student loans back in 2014 instead of investing.
In hindsight, I should have invested, but I'd make the same decision I made then today given the chance. Because if I had invested and the market tank, I'd probably set myself back financially 10-fold.

The success of the united states and any contrary for that matter is heavily tied to the value of its currency. "Money is power". The US has a lot of power to protect that position.

You should realize that in 2011, only about 2% of people who currently know about bitcoin, knew about it back then. In 2013, it’s ~ 20%.
If you believe in bitcoin 10xing again, you believe in another 500% increase in outreach to people who currently don’t know what bitcoin is.
Since that seems impossible, then you have to start getting a higher conversion rate of people who know what is it versus people who actually invest in bitcoin.

I think you're right.
For one, money is already virtual. Transferring money is way easier for the majority of the population than any crypto currency.
Decentralization is a buzz word. Again, the majority of the population has no reason not to trust the current central authorities. I don't see that changing in our lifetime, and if it did, I think we'd all have bigger problems.
On top of that, in order to be completely decentralized, you need to manage your own wallets. This requires a pretty significant investment in order to both protect and backup your private key. You can go down the rabbit hole on why this becomes an issue.
I think early on, Bitcoin was cool. Paypal was a huge pain in the ass back then. There was not any competitors in the space that were better. Bitcoin is outdated at this point. There are better solutions for every problem it is trying to solve.

That's not how it works. You can't straight up steal coins. You can
* Ensure you always get the block reward
* Deny transactions from happening
* Reverse transactions
The latter would allow you to counterfeit money, but it doesn't allow you to steal it. Essentially, you'd have to trade bitcoin for something else and then later on, the person would realize they didn't actually receive the bitcoin. What that means is that whatever you trading for also has to not be reversible and be quick, so it's really not the big part of the risk.
The big issue with the 51% attack is trust. If people no longer trust the network, people won't use it, bitcoin goes to zero.

Most of us invest a percentage of our earnings. That's typically what we're willing to lose. You can only buy the dip if you haven't depleted what you're willing to lose.
When the price of bitcoin falls for months on end, most retail investors will have already bought in much higher and ran out of money.
Hence you can either "buy the dip" or "invest what you're willing to lose" at that point. Unable to do both.

It's also not an apples to apples comparison. For instance, comparing "computers" to Pokemon-go? I'm pretty sure it would have been pretty easy for computers to quickly be used by 50M people if distributing it was completely free for the user and everyone by and large had access to do it.

More useless front page content.

Ahh yes. Taking expensive ASICs and dripping grease on them in order to make them serve dual purposes.
Seems brilliant.
Something i learned in life the hard way: Just because you can, doesn't me you should...

Still a solid idea.

It was on coinbase after I entered my credentials.

already has existed in some sense. There was a bitcoin p2p lending company that went under because it was mostly a scam.

Drop 400% would be a negative value.
Specifically: -3 * &lt;original_value&gt;
@_date: 2018-12-06 18:52:15
what does dropped 400% mean?

I think he was saying the lowest it's gone, not stating the absolute lowest it will go.

You really missed the boat here. OP is stating to basically just do the opposite of what the masses are doing, and you’ll win. Sometimes, the masses are right. 
Hindsight is 20/20.

Wanting something to happen doesn’t make it true.

I’m sure glad I can count on the past to predict the future.

I’ve lost nearly $80,000 on btc and other crypto
@_date: 2018-12-03 22:25:42
Well yeah. Assuming that bitcoin will go up isn’t a given.
I’ve said this before and I’ll say it again, holding bitcoin when you’ve lost 80% on it isn’t the hard part. The hard part is not selling once you’ve recouped your losses.
Buying bitcoin when it’s been hemorrhaging for a year is also hard.

It can't be manipulated by governments and banks....except everyone blames governments and banks whenever the price of bitcoin takes a tumble. So I guess have it your way...

To be fair, the explosion was pretty unprecedented. I’ve been in bitcoin for a long time, and I’ve owned bitcoin for a long time, but still managed to lose a lot of money.
I watched bitcoin go from $200 to $400 and then hang out their for a while.
Suddenly one day it’s $1000.
Then it’s $2000. By the time it reached this point, I was pretty happy with my returns and had sold the majority of my investment.
Going from $200 to 2000 seemed like exactly what you’re talking about. Surely this is the top and we should expect a reversal, especially with stocks doing relatively well as well.
But then in a blink of an eye, it’s 4000, 6000, 10,000, 16,000.
The fomo was insane. I had sold around 20 btc that I bought for somewhere between 5-10K and made roughly 40k off it, and somehow I felt terrible. “Could have paid off my mortgage.”
I sold bitcoin thinking exactly what you’re saying. This growth is unsustainable and will reverse, at which point I’ll buy more.
And it eventually did reverse, as we all know. But not until increasing another 900%.
And so when it dropped down to $10K, you bet your ass I thought i was getting a bargain. And it dropped, and I bought more, and it dropped and I bought more,  and this went on for a while.
In reality, bitcoin could have went to $100K. Hell, it still could. But don’t act like this shit is easy to predict. It’s all a gamble.
