Once atomic swaps are released they will eventually blend with each other.

“It just does not make any sense. ***It is not under the supervision*** of the United States Federal Reserve or any other ***central bank***. I don't believe in it at all. I am in agreement with Jamie Dimon.”
Well, that's the fucking point you stupid goat-fucker.

Good luck again.

As a person who's watched his portfolio all the way down to -96%? ...
I say go for it young man. Despite it would be really the best way for you to spend that hundred bucks - it's possibly the best time for  a purchase because it won't probably go much lower.
Invest 50% in BTC and 50% in one of the top coins with highest potential increase rate (ETH/LTC/IOTA/NEO/ZIL imo).
And read some stuff about bitcoin and Blockchain technology :)
Good luck kiddo !
