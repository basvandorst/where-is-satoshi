He didn't become famous for that. He became famous with how easy it is to manipulate people and centralized systems. He made it obvious that current security measures are just an illusion. He made the world a better place as far as I'm concerned.

It is actually backed by politics and GDP, imho monopoly. The US Federal Reserve controls the amount of money in circulation + the commercial banks, of course. So the US basically has a big influence in the world and they only work with USD, so every deal they make, it must be paid in USD. Taxes from the citizens are also collected in the form of USD and the general wealth of the US is in USD. So basically that is what backs up the USD

You are right. My point was that, for example the global GDP for 2016 is 75.4$ trillion and the US GDP for 2016 is 57.46$ trillion. Which in my view amounts to nearly the same percent of USD domination in the international market. Meaning those big deals that basically control who gets what, how much and when. That being force on the world by strong political and military tactics gives USD its value. Everyone has agreed to accept the USD as a valuable form of exchange and there's little they can do about it. The US has control of spoken USD, basically monopolizing the world financial and economical sectors. I don't know. I'm following the whole thing with interest, because big big power is at stake, and not just for the United States. Other countries would like to take the spot of the US and are creeping up.

So basically Coinbase might not even be at fault for closing their account. There is a lot of regulations that they are **obligated** to follow. I don't see what the fuss is about. It's not like they froze or stole the funds in their account.
