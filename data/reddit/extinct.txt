I preferred to pay [nearly the same price]( as the official shop and agree to be a beta tester for the VR SHOP (which will accept bitcoin payments) and have it shipped in like 5 days.
apparently, [HTC Vive gets the same treatment](
For those asking how is this btc related ... well, a vr shop is coming to life and it accepts bitcoin payments. their beta program prioritize cryptocurrency and it gives you a chance to have a VR. you just have to test their *shit* - which means to use Bitcoin in a Virtual Reality Shop - and give a feedback afterwards.

yes it's more like a sticker than a watermark
edit: purchased it from l-os.com and agreed to apply to their beta testing program. this was the only condition for shipment, that's why it has that sticker but it can easily be removed

tbh I don't really know. From what I've read, they made a partenership with Facebook or something like that so they can release that VR Shop in the next months. That's why you have to agree the Beta Testing application when you order. Like okay we sell you Oculus Rift or HTC Vive but you have to be a beta tester for us. I'll keep you updated if you want. Lumiere VR Shop is a big project but they don't make too many information public atm
