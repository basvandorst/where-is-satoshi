I woke up from a dream this morning where 1 BTC was at $55k.... was hoping it was real when I woke up

Yes today around 11:30 (EST) the price went crazy, jumping up almost $2,000 in like 2 mins. Then resulted in crashing Coinbase and GDAX

If it is coming back down now, you can almost look at it like a way that it could be a good time to buy in some. Obviously only put in what you are willing to loose, but if you look at what the value did back in 2014... it hit an all time high of $1000 and crashed back down. I think It’s possible we could see that again in the future if the price right now falls back a bit

It seems if you buy on a weekend, it takes longer. I placed 2 orders on Sunday 11/26 that just came into my account yesterday. I placed another order on Monday 11/27 that came in on Friday 12/1.

That’s what I was saying with the stabilization

GDAX crashed on me while I was trying to buy when it exploded today. Bought at $19,100. Don’t know why, I guess I thought it’d hit that $20k mark and I’d sell. But now I’m hodling that BTC transaction until we pass $19k again :)

100% agree. Such a good analogy. We have an opportunity now to be a part of a change in the way the world works. It’s incredible

Maybe that came off in a more confident way than I meant lol. What I meant was On GDAX you can see the volumes that others are placing buy and sell limits at.. so you can somewhat speculate if there are large sell orders in place at a certain amount, that if it hits that amount, it may drive the price down a little. Maybe I’m just completely wrong on that but the way I’m looking at it makes sense to me and has been working so far

If you log on to Coinbase on a computer, so using the desktop version, it tells you dates that orders should arrive in your account

I’m just getting started with GDAX today.. you set buy and sell limits and can kind of gauge where it’s going to go. Obviously can be risky and is slow to build up growth if working with small amounts

This is true, if you look at bitcoin as an investment. Of course that is in focus right now with the volatility of it and  possibility of where it could go. But the whole idea of bitcoin and what will make it last is the use of it as a currency. Yes the price would have to stabilize for it to be used efficiently, but more and more places making it easy to use as currency is what will make it worth so much. That’s what we all want, isn’t it? For the price to go to the Moon

My fiancé’s spirit animal is an elephant and she believed in me when I wanted to get into crypto. We’re buying our first house together in the next few months. Just found it funny your username has elephant in it
