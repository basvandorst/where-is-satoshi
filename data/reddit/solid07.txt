You can't possibly be this stupid. What you're saying is that $200 worth of merchandise you bought last week is now worth $300. Bitcoin measures its value against the dollar currency and adjusts itself ACCORDINGLY. Not to itself. Think harder next time.

According to the People’s Bank of China and four other ministries and agencies: Bitcoin is a “virtual commodity that does not share the same legal status of a currency. Nor can, or should, it be circulated or used in the marketplace as a currency.”
Ouch. You bought in at the wrong time bro. **Hopefully it's the amount you won't mind losing.** 
@_date: 2013-12-12 16:44:26
Only invest with amount of money you're willing to lose.
This is such a bad idea and it's crazy to see people jump into this first without learning about the market, its implication on banks/governments, its technology, etc...
We need to limit people who panic buy and end up panic selling. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 15:47:33
This is just the beginning. Expect more news like this in the near future.
@_date: 2013-11-10 14:21:54
Now, this is true. I remember when I first heard about bitcoin, they were primarily using it for drug trades on secret website using TOR.

The image was downloaded directly from Apple's AppStore, but people with hackintosh would have to use Unibeast to burn it onto their USB drive in order to install it. 
Was just wondering if you knew anything about potential Unibeast/Multibeast keylogging problems.
@_date: 2013-11-10 13:27:05
No, seriously. **Essential to who?**
Most people buy bitcoin so they can get more money out of it. 
**Bitcoin  just isn't essential yet to most people in their daily lives today** since we still use debit/credit cards for everything (gas, local groceries, merchandise/business transaction, etc...) 
Why? Its value is just more god damn stable. Most established big businesses aren't willing to lose money using a currency that can lose its value over night.

Do you have any specific supports for your claim that 1BTC can be valued at $10,000?
@_date: 2013-11-10 13:06:32
Yeah, or banks are actually useful to safely store your currency. **And if they get stolen, you're insured from the losses. Not to mention, they protect your asses from frauds.** (not like the shady bitcoin banks we have today)
Big banks should find a way to integrate bitcoin to provide that same service while MINIMIZING the fees at the same time for those who want to safely store money online and use their wallet actually as a wallet.
Streamline the transition a bit more. Give people choices. It can't hurt.

Bad news coming from China mostly and speculating that other governments will crack down on bitcoin as well since it severely undermines their own country's currencies.
@_date: 2013-12-08 15:30:09
It's really hard to tell to be honest.
There will be more resistance from the government and banks (Australian bank already prohibits their customers from transferring their money to purchase bitcoin). More manipulation of the bitcoin market, so on and so forth. On the flip side, there will be more stores accepting bitcoin as payment ASSUMING there will be more services like coinbase where people could convert their bitcoin into USD ASAP to avoid the value from depreciating too quickly.
Once this volatility settles down significantly and people gain confidence in this digital currency, we can see a huge growth in number of stores (including gas station and grocery stores) accepting Bitcoin. But again, assuming the government doesn't clamp down on Bitcoin to protect its own fiat currency.
@_date: 2013-12-12 17:07:09
You really think 1 BTC could be worth $10,000? Most people think it's already over-priced considering you can't buy much and do much with them.

@_date: 2013-12-07 02:15:32
If you haven't been reading the news coming from China, you should. Bitcoin future looks very grim over there which affects U.S. Bitcoin trading market in return. 
There are many people out there that strongly believe this will change the world.
One main problem I have with this so called "currency" is its volatility. As long as it grows and crashes constantly like this, it will be very risky for business owners to use it to give proper values to their merchandise and services.
Should you sell or hold? It's ultimately up to you.
Read and decide on your own. That's the best anyone can do for now. Me? I'm holding. I **know** what I'm dealing with and I've only invested amount of cash that I can afford to lose.
@_date: 2013-12-18 13:55:48
Many people didn't buy in at $100. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 15:12:41
Yep. One of the main reasons why I don't recommend my friends and family to invest in Bitcoin. It obviously seems like a pump and dump scheme at the moment. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 12:13:06
Kind of, but could you scan it seamlessly and effortlessly like in the movie? Meaning, not stopping your hand  motion for the machine to scan it.
@_date: 2013-11-10 13:10:54
You're missing my point. Bitcoin's value is being changed TOO FAST. So if you were to buy $200 worth of stuff just **ONE WEEK** ago, you personally lost about $100 give or take.
* Value on Nov. 3rd: ~$213
* Value today after correction:  ~$335
Until this has been stabilized a bit more, most people aren't just going to use bitcoin knowing that they're throwing their money away and losing cash.

@_date: 2014-02-13 18:33:09
This is the main reason what's wrong with this so called "currency."
Many people, including the rich Winklevoss brothers, buy to HOLD. They're just in it for the money and not to use them. Ridiculous.
@_date: 2014-02-22 13:14:23
People who do this are the same type of people who don't listen and keep their bitcoin on exchanges and online wallets. 
@_date: 2014-03-28 14:59:55
Please read carefully. There's a separate discussion on this already. And again NO. You are not exempt from taxation even if the transaction is less than $600. 
@_date: 2014-04-02 16:06:27
I'm predicting a slow decrease in value until it hits its stabilization point around $200 - $300. Many people believe bitcoin is still overpriced at $450 considering all the tax hassle and you can't do much with it currently. Bitcoin is still at its infant stage. People who are looking to get a quick buck out of it will lose money by panic buying and selling. Bitcoin won't reach $1000 again by the end of this year but it will again some other time. 
@_date: 2014-02-10 13:16:25
@_date: 2014-03-28 11:36:10
That may be so, but the fact that the biggest markets are going through clamp downs is a huge indication that it is NOT a good time to buy to USE IT as a currency. News coming from China indicate bitcoin is pretty much dead for the consumers. News coming from the US indicate a huge disadvantage of using bitcoin compare to debit cards. Most of the markets you've mentioned are very small and many European governments will be regulating bitcoin transactions sooner or later. **Which goes back to the question: What are the actual advantages of using bitcoin instead of debit cards for the consumers?**
@_date: 2014-03-06 14:51:52
Also, transactions can take a couple of minutes to verify. That is VERY slow.

@_date: 2014-10-22 11:56:09
Then it goes back to the question, what advantage is there for using Bitcoin over Visa/Mastercard/AmEx with Apple Pay? Considering Bitcoin's value fluctuates a lot more than a given USD?
@_date: 2014-07-02 19:55:34
Still no answer. Go play games somewhere else, kid.
@_date: 2014-03-06 14:45:09
Yes, but it's easier to take out your credit card, swipe it, and be done with it. With bitcoin at the moment, you have to take out your phone, open up the app, type in the amount, use QR code then wait for verification. It seems too complicated and time-consuming for mainstream use.

Horrible time to buy considering the IRS announcement. The advantage of using bitcoin by average consumers is pretty much out the window now. It'll be a hassle for them to keep track of their spending and report each and every one of their bitcoin transactions. Just plain ridiculous.

No it isn't. If he exchanges bitcoin for fiat immediately, those bitcoin will be sold on coinbase at least and have more chance in getting circulated.

CEO owns it. Of course he would like to see its value appreciate.
In practical applications, bitcoin would be a nightmare for eBay and Paypal since they deal with returns and disputes all the time. How they're going to deal with the **fluctuating value** of Bitcoin on top of it is still very uncertain.

@_date: 2014-03-28 15:07:07
The very foundation of bitcoin was based on internet monetary value transaction. The perception of bitcoin as gold was later established by new bitcoiners and they are very unwise to think so since bitcoin will not advance when they are used as such. Not to mention, you are undermining the very function of crypto currency technology. 
However, betting that this technology is promising to the consumers in the future is a good way to invest. Not as gold. 
@_date: 2014-03-28 16:55:49
Now you're being childish. Come back once you've learned the history of crypto currency technology. 
@_date: 2015-01-17 16:36:09
What are you using Bitcoin for? Will you be using it daily? Finding the purpose of Bitcoin is more important than just buying it to hold like &gt;90% of Bitcoin owners are doing. 
From what I've used so far, transaction is just too slow, price volatility is ridiculous, and there's not much I can do with it in the real world aside on the internet. 
With Apple Pay and other electronic pay systems on the rise, it will be very hard to convince people to use an unreliable, unsecured, slow electronic payment system. 
@_date: 2015-01-18 12:33:51
This pretty much goes to show how out of touch some of these Bitcoin supporters have become. You can't convince others to buy and use Bitcoin with just **hopes and dreams** when in actuality it is a terrible currency to use. 
@_date: 2015-01-17 20:52:26
As long as the underlying problems aren't solved, Bitcoin won't be usable as a reliable currency in the long run. I can imagine Bitcoin being completely abandoned and replaced with something much better. It's a very great concept but can be much much better and greater. 
@_date: 2015-01-27 13:02:31
Remember Mt. Gox? Yeah. That's why.
@_date: 2015-01-31 12:14:58

@_date: 2015-01-17 16:24:02
What are you doing?
@_date: 2014-02-12 13:38:12
It's good that bitcoin hasn't gone mainstream yet. Clearly it has a lot of kinks to iron out. 
I don't mind them as long as people are honest about the issues and working to fix it instead of playing the blame game like  incompetent Mt. Gox did.
@_date: 2015-01-18 13:03:35
You nailed many of them in the head. The main issue with Bitcoin that I found from my use is the **price volatility**. The fact that my bitcoins (bought at $600 valuation) to keep in my wallet for use is now $200 is just fucking ridiculous. 
Until this volatility is resolved, Bitcoin won't be a good currency to use, period. 
@_date: 2014-03-13 17:47:18
The reason why they're so successful is the buyer/seller protection they provide. The fees would be close to what they're charging if a 3rd party service decided to emulate this with bitcoin since bitcoin offers no protection like banks and paypal do. 
@_date: 2015-01-17 16:46:39
Yet I still don't see any impact in society outside. Most people who bandwagon Bitcoin don't use Bitcoin themselves daily not realizing how impractical it is to use it as a currency. Using a currency that drastically changes price every week is just not practical for most businesses.  And most businesses that do that take bitcoin end up changing them back to USD/their preferred currency right away.  
People should realize the practical implication of USING bitcoin instead of owning them.

Not really. MSDos PC was very useful for many businesses at the time.

First main use of Bitcoin started off with people using it to buy drugs on darknet site, Silk Road. That's how most people found out about Bitcoin and doesn't help the fact that those politicians are linking the connection between the two strongly. This bad image will be hard to shake off in the coming months with the ongoing trial with Silk Road as well.

For starters, they make it a fuck ton easier to buy bitcoin than going through some shady, confusing sites. I remember going through this painful process of obtaining some bitcoin back in 2013. 
Second, their wallets are insured. So if they get hacked, you'll still have your bitcoin. 
Third, their exchange is one of the first official ones to open up on U.S. No need to worry about someone pulling a Mt. Gox on people again. 
We tried law-less, decentralized banking and it failed miserably because of shady people. And this as a result, ruined Bitcoin's reputation. I, for one, welcome this change although I still think Bitcoin will be replaced by some other digital currency which its price isn't based on some small exchange where it can be manipulated this easily.

**Using bitcoin as a currency is just too risky and it's just not practical due to its price volatility.**
I like the tech behind bitcoin but not the bitcoin itself and the way people promote it as a currency but at the same time treating it as a stock. 
**Bitcoin is going away but not the concept of digital currency.**

Inflation isn't controlled by the 1%. You're sounding like some conspiracy theorist.

-Seeing and actually experiencing are 2 different things. 
-Coinbase wallets are insured from others hacking into their servers or from theft. And yes of course if you're not doing your part to keep your wallet safe, that is your fault. You can't be that thick. 
-Coinbase exchange is officially regulated in U.S. 
-While I do support Bitcoin through its ups and downs, I'm realistic. Digital currency is a very great concept that has huge potential. Unfortunately for Bitcoin, its price volatility will be the one killing it as a currency. Not to mention, its price can be too easily manipulated. 
-Many Bitcoin supporters are hypocritical in that they market it as a currency yet they use and keep it as a stock. 
**-You come across as a very bitter person. It's sad, but you won't be able to change people's behavior by ranting on a subreddit that majority of people in this country don't care to read. Think bigger, my friend.**

What are those people you speak of working on exactly to make this currency less volatile, more secure, faster, and others? 
Most people have invested in for the wrong reasons (greed). I find it ironic that people who push others to buy Bitcoin are the same ones who don't use Bitcoin as a currency themselves but treat it as a stock. I see many people blindly pushing Bitcoin without addressing the problems that arises when it's actually being used as a currency.
**It sounds great on paper, but it is terrible to use in the real world.**

Not this again. You have got to be kidding me. XD save your conspiracy theory for someone else.

When using linear scale, it appears to be decreasing fast. Interesting chart nonetheless. Thanks.

Their foundation will be using digital currency that's NOT bitcoin:


Overall financial transactions will get cheaper using the work we do and Bitcoin related approaches.
Making sure that it doesn't help terrorists is a challenge for all new technology.

I already risked the money that I can afford to lose a year and a half ago. I'm not wasting any more of my money on Bitcoin at the moment.

So you think Bitcoin's transaction speed, price volatility, etc... can be solved with "wallets, regulations, financial instruments like etfs, derivatives, shorting, commodity pairs, insurance". You're not thinking straight.
**Be more specific.** 
What projects do you know of that specifically speeds up Bitcoin transaction speed?
What projects help to stabilize Bitcoin price?
What projects are there to make Bitcoin safer to use and store?
 
@_date: 2015-01-18 13:15:48
But when Bitcoin price goes up, they don't consider it "unstable." They consider it a good investment. Come on now. 
@_date: 2015-01-31 14:00:37
A lot of Bitcoin supporters like this one isn't very good at convincing people. 
@_date: 2015-01-17 20:47:08
I'm still not convinced that volatility and speed of transaction can be solved easily with Bitcoin.
