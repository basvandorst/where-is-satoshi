Thank you for the tip, but it really wasn't necessary :) Regards!

Bitcoin network rules work at all times. You made a mistake; Bitfury pool is not a bank, it doesn't provide support for bitcoin customers on their mistakes.
Before we start any talks please confirm the ownership of the source address 1Eb8YjdMMHSAsJfJZN53Uc534avB1c88Jz by sending a message to the pool address (1FeDtFhARLxjKUPPkQqEBL78tisenc9znS): "Dear BitFury, please be so kind and return me from your honestly collected fee my mistake 0.93656862 BTC, minus 0.0001 fee for processing &amp; 0.0004 your bonus". (Any reward for request processing is welcomed.)

Don't mention it. All the best!

We have sent you 0.93656862BTC as promised.
Be careful next time.

One possible attack of such kind is as follows: A certain person/organization opens channels with a huge number of nodes in the Lightning Network, sets small fees, but eventually refuses to route payments (say, because it went offline for a couple of days). This may lead to situation when all found candidate routes for a majority of payments do not work because they all contain the “bad” node. Hence, nodes in the network have no choice but to dump channels onto the blockchain and/or create new channels en masse.
We have actually developed a relatively easy means to counter such an attack. With a straightforward modification, Flare can select a set of candidate payment paths in such a way that any given node is present in a relatively small fraction of the candidate paths. In this case, paths not passing through a “bad” node would always be found during routing (if these paths exist, of course).

Thanks for your encouragement! Of course, we’ll continue contributing to the development of Lightning, both with new studies and with code.

An answer for Jameson in case he lurks here, and for anyone curious.
We address adversarial network conditions to some extent in the algorithm: we find several route candidates each time before sending a payment, so if one node on the path starts to behave funny it should be easy to roll back and switch to a different path. Also we tend to choose route candidates that do not overlap much (these details are omitted in the paper, hope we will release another one on that eventually). This increases a probability that a new path would not contain the problematic node. Additionally, in next versions of the algorithm we are thinking of introducing a rating system for nodes. For example, the nodes with a history of bad behavior may have a multiplier to their fees applied when candidate paths are considered.
The point about rebalancing is valid. We plan to introduce rebalancing logic as an incremental improvement over basing routing algorithm in the future.
