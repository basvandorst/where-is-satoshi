Early player like and myself are likely to have a rather different idea than latecomers. For the "earlies" who maybe got in at 2c we are quite happy to spend a bit now and again while hodling the rest. Personally I have spent between 1% and 2% of remaining balance every year, except this year where (so far) I have not spent any. As posted elsewhere I will be spending if the price reaches $600 before  Christmas. And by spending I do of course generally mean cashing out to realmoney as realistically there are very few places where I can directly spend BTC on things that I want (I am not into drugs, pron, prostitutes or murder for hire - well not this year anyway).

It's related to the psychology of penny shares vs Berkeshire Hathaway @ $207,227 (latest). IE The price of the share is not what you should be looking at, its the value of the whole company.
@_date: 2015-11-03 00:18:02
$666 +/- 20%. If I see $600 this year I will be selling about 1-2% of my hodling to buy a few luxuries over the Christmas holiday. If I don't see $600 I will lose no sleep. Cryptocurrency is an experiment in its very early stages, just a mewling &amp; puking baby now, really. It need to grow up rather a lot.

I think your comments and thread of argument fall apart rather rapidly when you consider the current existence of numerous altcoins and other crypto related ideas which don't actually use bitcoin itself.
There is no killer feature which is unique to bitcoin. It only happens to be the first to market and happens to be the largest by size, but interestingly not by a huge magnitude now.
If you don't take action to make bitcoin more suitable for the average joe then another crypto will do so , that is an absolute certainty, and bitcoin will be left far far behind.

I would encourage every bitcoin enthusiast to get involved in doing raw transactions to better understand the inner workings of cryptocurrency. Just start with moving small amounts around for fun till you get the hang of it. You might have one or 2 mistakes along the way but if its only pennies (or even penny shavings) you are playing with it will not really matter. Perhaps partner with someone you know who is also a bitcoin enthusiast and work together on sending a few bits between one another. If you trust one another mistakes can easily be corrected without tears anyway. Doing is learning, learning should be fun !
@_date: 2015-10-20 06:33:30
I think I would have to agree with (his recent very long post)  on this one. The changed world ain't gonna happen in the next few decades.  You need to move the world over to Bitcoin on their terms first and then let the natural consequences follow. It WILL be necessary to start with a regulated Bitcoin running alongside and in association with realmoney and the institutions. World change in respect to those oft spouted ideals of freedom and libertarianism are likely to come much much later. 
I am firmly of the belief that if we follow your line of thinking then bitcoin will simply remain a "toy for nerds to buy drugs" and quite likely this will result in it being somewhat smaller than it is now in both number of users and indeed realmoney price.

@_date: 2015-10-15 12:48:52
In a word, no ! Fairly basic economics I would have thought, the price of anything you can buy (including a crypto or basket thereof) is determined by what someone who holds (hodl here ?) it is prepared to sell for. The only way you can have an exchange of any type is with a community of buyers and sellers and, so far, with a third party/intermediary. It might theoretically be possible to construct a decentralised exchange of sorts without a third party which puts buyers and sellers together directly but who is going to go to the effort of making it and who is going to maintain it or repair it when something goes wrong.
If you want an asset that tracks something else then again you need a centralised/third party to construct it and they will usually have to model it on the basis that the asset actually has the backing i.e. hodling (again) of its constituents. 
Also bear in mind that the "top 10" is a fluid grouping that will change with time. How do we cope with one crypto dropping out and another coming in ?
If you are simply looking to the future and are trying to "hedge your bets" because you do not think bitcoin will be sure to be the eventual winner in crypto space then I simply suggest you buy a little of each of the cryptos you like as well as bitcoin. It is after all relatively simple to buy many of these now and you can stuff them all away in your own cold storage for as long as you like.

You have (slightly ?) missed the point. It is not me getting upset. It is not me you need to convince about the positivity of SR or benefits of freedom to use drugs. The point i am making is that if we want bitcoin to become widely adpted we have to take account of the views of the majority of the people who we want to use it. That majority is, I believe, pro law and order, anti drugs, anti (most) immorality and so on. It's not about what you think or what I think. It is about what 100,000,000 ordinary citizens of Western democracies think.
@_date: 2015-10-20 15:05:47
Hi, I am fairly new hear so please feel free to correct me if I have missed something important, I would rather hear some useful input than simply be downvoted for being "an idiot" !
Anyway I would like to start off with fourth bullet point. In particular the wording of it. Surely if you have a decentralized system like bitcoin with multiple independent miners securing the network you can never "ensure" anything. At any time anybody can attempt to push a hard fork with any parameters for any reason whatsoever be it selfish, hostile, helpful or anything else. What actually happens will be entirely in the hands of the miners. The only way you can even attempt to come close to ensuring the results of a fork (whether accepting a good one or rejecting a bad one) is if you can enter into a sound dialogue with a majority of the miners. Is this even practical or possible ? If it is then you will also be competing with any other group or organization with perhaps an opposing fork who will be doing the same.

If your theory was workable it would have already happened with realmoney in that I could buy a sandwich for £2.00 at the shop next to Thomsons and get euros as change at the sandwich shop cheaper than the foreign currency desk next door. This does not happen now. There are very good reasons why.
It is all very well being an enthusiast of Bitcoin but could we try to moderate the (very) amateur schoolboyish "look I like Bitcoin so now I am an economist" type of post.
There are more important things to work on with respect to the multiple impracticalities of scaling this cryptocurrency right now so we don't need silly distractions like this. 
@_date: 2015-10-19 23:00:37
It would be just the stance the mods take. They just need to clearly post the rules, the dos and dont's and enforce them properly. They then need to be robust in rebutting "unjust" calls from others where they have not banned an alleged troll. And if certain users persist in calling others trolls when the mods have not decreed them as so then those users should be banned for being disruptive and not respecting the authority of the mods. It may not be perfect but we could give it a go for a trial period of a couple of months. It would soon be apparent if it results in an improvement or not.

I don't think we need "consensus", we just need the mods to decide on the parameters and enforce them properly. The mods should know their users well enough from observation of everyday activities to decide what is right for  They should simply publish the rules and act.

Indeed, we all know about anonymity, dark markets, malware blackmail, etc but surely we (and Bitcoin itself would be far better off if we could reduce their numbers both here and in their involvement in Bitcoin. As a thought experiment consider what would happen if we partnered with some law enforcement agencies and for certain categories of criminals helped to identify them and confiscate their bitcoins.  
@_date: 2015-10-25 19:53:26
It would serve cryptocurrency rather better if we stopped obsessing about the price every time it moves a bit up or down. This is largely irrelevant and not significant anyway if you look at the historical price voltaility.
There are far more important things to discuss such as practical methods for using bitcoin, scaling it etc. I am fundamentally opposed to some of the silly censorship that the mods do here but one activity would get my vote - censoring posts about the realmoney price ! 
@_date: 2015-10-20 14:18:12
I don't think this is helpful. Tackle the real causes of the image problem. The criminals and scammers. Can we not make some efforts to eject them from the bitcoin space or make life somewhat harder for them ? Suggestions invited !

You are welcome, I am always happy to give out tips to help newcomers.

That appears to be a very strange opinion though it does fit with some of the anti-bank anti-realmoney type of sentiment I have seen a few times. However I think there are rather more participants who are really trying to help and improve things so I think it is a small minority who think like that.
@_date: 2015-10-19 18:54:28
Thanks very much I appreciate the sentiment. However I have just had a look at the T&amp;Cs of that ChargeTip company and I am not sure I really trust them (no offense) or even understand what their purpose is.

Personally I disagree with Bitcoin XT on several levels but I do think it is important to be able to debate it and discuss it AND all other possible proposals/variations/improvements to Bitcoin without censorship. And if I get 100 downvotes I don't mind anyway , I am not here to try to please other people. I would like to think I am here to assist with the mission to take bitcoin to the future as a one world currency or at least something massively more useful than it currently is.
Note I never say "Moon" as I interpret that (rightly or wrongly) as being related to those who are fixated on a price chart of BTC against realmoney and in my opinion it is not about that (or should not be !).

@_date: 2015-10-19 21:38:43
Trolls are, I think, part of the problem. The other part  is, as you identify, the failure of the community here to really act in the interests of furthering bitcoin. Perhaps it is easier if we get rid of the trolling problem first, which does look as though it might be quite significant. Once that has been done (hopefully quite quickly by moderator banning according to robust rules) we can try to move the sub into a more open discussion of the pros and cons of bitcoin, defects, improvements, ideas, etc and I think we will find this is easier and pleasanter without the "noise" of the trolls intruding. 
@_date: 2015-10-19 20:58:37
That is indeed one (important) example in my observations.
@_date: 2015-10-19 20:47:19
Some interesting points there. I will just pick one out for the moment.


This can be considered true but if so then I am pretty sure one also concludes that criminality and morality are subjective everywhere in every system on this planet. I am quite happy to agree with you on that for the moment But.. surely what matters if we want Bitcoin to become mainstream and to succeed as a world currency is what the majority of the general public believe. I am pretty sure the vast majority of them (well certainly in Western democracies) consider that criminality is pretty well defined by the laws of the land and you won't get very far standing in front of the judge and disagreeing with him "subjectively". We want Bitcoin to be widely adopted so we need to consider the views of the majority of potential adoptees otherwise we risk simply being a "toy" currency for a small club of enthusiasts. 
@_date: 2015-10-19 20:57:12
Perhaps one of the best things we could do with here is a "Childish-o-meter" ?

@_date: 2015-10-19 20:35:23
If you check my post you will see I said;
"However I observe virtually the opposite behaviour from *many* participants here."
Not the *majority* of posts ! And I do agree there are many interesting discussions and helpful advice and technical stuff BUT..
there are too many "self-destructive" comments (includingsome of the replies to my particular post here today unfortunately !!). 
@_date: 2015-10-17 08:21:19
There is a well known saying here in the UK;
"You pays your money and you takes your choice"
So if you don't like it you are not going to use it. Some will (already have) some won't (like you). However in the current climate I think none of us should be surprised by this. 
Entry (and exit) to Bitcoin is inevitably going to be subject to KYC/AML in any "regulated" area and any "unregulated" area is going to be subject to a possible SFYL.
Mining provides a low risk entry without monetary exchange problems but is clearly highly capital intensive and beyond the reach of 99.99999% of those interested now.
I think it is true (and becomes more so as time progresses) that untainted unused BTC such as from early mining will become more valuable than "used" coins.
Yes, I know I have a vested interest ! However  "taint" is something that has been around for a long time and as the blockchain gets longer surely it becomes easier to "link" transactions and identify criminal activity involving coins ?
@_date: 2015-10-20 20:28:33
I wonder if there is, contrary to my initial assumption, actually a lot of acting in self interest going on i.e. a degree of manipulation of this sub not by trolls but by people who have simply bought bitcoin hoping it will go up and they want to profit from it. This appears to be an explanation that fits some of the behaviour round here but I guess it would be rather difficult to determine if it were true. Do you think there is something like this going on at least part of the time, particularly in light of the fact that the realmoney value of a coin has been dropping rather a lot over the last year or more ?

Yes, (I am a fan of Douglas Adams too), this seems a common view and you are well upvoted on that succinct and clear comment.

@_date: 2015-10-17 14:50:48
It's interesting but these are very early days for Gemini. Keep an eye on it. May look very different in 6 months time if it gets "critical mass". Unfortunately there is no clear way of predicting what that will be but I am guessing that if it gets to over 50K BTC/day I will be opening (more) champagne.
