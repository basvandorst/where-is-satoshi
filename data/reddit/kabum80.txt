People just don't get it, Iridion3007. Don't get mad so quickly with brain deads. I believe you every word. 
Socialism doesn't work. Period. 
Be well and your family also. Its hard seeing how your country is ruined by some psychopathic, corrupted individuals. So sad..

They are doing this already. Look at David Hay video, where he is talking about helping his family with crypto. Buying all kind of stuff with it. My point is, that government that is really bad with everything, its tyrannic, corrupted, etc, cant save the Venezuelans with their own crypto. It's naive and pretty stupid idea. Because the idea that drives this government, the country is wrong. It doesn't work. Chavism(socialism) doesn't work. And they now that. They just don't  want to quit. They must be replaced by the force. That's it. They will not just go. Psychopaths like them don't quit like that. In history never did. This is not a democracy. It's totalitarian regime. God help them!

Maybe he isn’t telling the truth to us. I don’t know for him. If he lies, shame on him. But what we all know, that people are hungry in V.. There is a lack of everything, even of food in this country. Its devastating situation where people are suffering the most. No matter if this guy is not telling the truth to us. 
Internet is not a reference for me. You can get it in public places for free.

You must be really naive, that this government will give crypto money to the people? If they cant do it with the biggest oil reserve on the planet earth, they will do it with crypto? Yea sure!

Probably there could be some internet connection, why do you find it weird? It took me 4s to the first article about food shortage.
Internet can be in many places. Not directly provided by the government.

Great. It's nice to see that mobile apps are coming for Nano too.

Great interview. Peter’s channel is one of the best crypto channel on YouTube. I like this guy.
It reminds me of story of Scott Adam, how he failed at many projects in his past to achieve the status that he has today.
