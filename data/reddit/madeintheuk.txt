That and snickers. 
I  think it's going to skyrocket within the next 5 years. I love how the whole dynamics of an economic system can change and how humans have such ingenuity. I look forward to the future.

That's exactly why he wanted you to watch it.

We didn't get your drift because you used a hashtag on reddit.

People who call Bitcoin a Ponzi Scheme, doesn't understand Ponzi Schemes. 


If you want to compare resource wastefulness, point your finger at the facebook servers, zynga servers or any other company that doesn't add value to human progressiveness. It's a terrible argument. 
We are building the future.

I actually didn't know that it was a graphic novel. I thought it was a screenplay written originally from the Parlament terrorist plot. I'm gonna look into that.

Do you have the link for the email list? If it hit the waves in 2009, I was way behind.

SUPER FACEPALM.

They don't make it cheap enough to be profitable for bitcoin mining. 
@_date: 2012-05-14 23:19:11
what exactly did you google to find out? 
@_date: 2012-06-18 21:30:31
From the comments....


OKAY. Where is that video of the old man falling down escalator?

Bitcoinica, sounds like Titanica. Close to a fucking shipwreck.

It's pretty infuriating that we are establishing a world-changer yet blog-journos only want to associate us with a Time Warner movie and a bunch of non-directional youngings who know Python.

How did you find out about it? I'm trying to find sources that get to the newest things first.

I actually used both, I read about the computational limits of the cpu vs. gpu but when I switched to GPU, I saw that there were peopling putting out Giga-hashes and so I gave up.

It didn't have much just a case of frag grenades and ar-15's.

And so it begins.

Did you do it the way I recommended or did you go through the regluar LTC/BTC method?
@_date: 2015-11-02 00:36:41
Good to hear. Most likely they are using their customers coins to buy/sell with hence the ONLY reason why you can't withdraw immediate
@_date: 2015-10-31 18:50:47
If anyone has a problem withdrawing LTC or BTC, email support and have them cancel the pending withdrawal. Then purchase Dogecoin with your LTC/BTC and withdraw to a Dogecoin wallet. Then use shapeshift.io to convert back. You will take a hit but it was the only way I could recover my coins. What a nightmare. 
edit: They seem to have no fractional reserves for Doge.

Fair enough, I was just worried that the devs overlooked that on the initial build of the product, which would point to much deeper flaws in the website code (including https certs). 
Bitcoin is doing well but we need no further hiccups especially while Mt. Gox gets it's shit together.

CampBX charges .55% as a transaction per trade. Scalable enough for micro transactions.

That's like slitting the cow's throat in hopes that the milk comes faster. You don't sabotage your entire business plan to play with an exchange that has close to a $1B market cap.

At that level, the text should be counted as fraud. 
@_date: 2013-01-02 18:59:09
The reason? Because trying another form of currency that competes with the standard (starting from 1200 B.C in China) money print model is exciting. It is the true first stable anonymous currency and although, OP, you might not see a utilitarian use for the Bitcoins, you should purchase them to fight against the status quo. 
TL;DR. Bitcoins, to you, are like a piece of the Berlin wall: It might just be regular concrete, but each piece holds a slice of history.

This was taken off the [front page]( I'd like to think I'm not over-reacting.
