Are you attempting to spell reverse?

Has BRD (iOS) fallen out of favor? It was all over the place months ago. I use it and love it.

''a bit of consolidation'' come on now. BTC has barely moved in two months.

@_date: 2019-10-25 18:56:11
Give me a fucking break. The last three months were brutal. That’s just a fact.
@_date: 2019-10-25 16:23:32
Happy with this spike, as long as it holds 8k at the very least. Zoom out to 3 months and you see how depressing the chart still is.
@_date: 2018-06-10 18:35:17
What a bunch of horrible sounds.

Hey Bitcoin, put on your big boy pants and stop fucking around as though defending 10K is some kind of big deal, for fuck's sake. Quit fucking around and head UP.
@_date: 2018-06-17 18:04:29
@_date: 2019-06-08 18:19:52
for it to shoot back up to 9K where we should be.
@_date: 2019-06-11 08:38:26
We all know BTC is divisible.
It's a necessary, arguably arbitrary, number to have a reasonable conversation. 1 BTC is a good starting point.
@_date: 2019-06-09 15:51:37
what are 'theorical attacks' ?
@_date: 2019-06-13 06:43:20
Not that great. Especially the repeat edits on some words/phrases were very annoying.
@_date: 2019-06-08 13:50:18
Sounds plausible. Thanks for your insights.
@_date: 2019-06-08 11:01:39
This resistance at 8k makes no sense. Who thinks they can explain?
@_date: 2019-10-26 06:38:32
Nah, current developments don’t change history.

Needs to hit 4K fucking yesterday. We shouldn’t settle for this measly gain. 
@_date: 2019-06-15 07:59:25
@_date: 2019-06-24 07:16:57
While we’re on a little language tangent: “Didn’t thought” = using past tense twice. “I didn’t think” is correct. Guten Tag.
@_date: 2019-04-27 10:27:40
this sideways stagnation after bullish pattern is such a fucking drag.

it’s = it is or it has
its = belonging to it
@_date: 2019-01-11 17:23:48
well played. well played indeed.
@_date: 2019-01-11 16:47:13
How are they the same?   
I don't give a fuck = I don't care  
I don't give two fucks = I don't care (nonsensical but ok, can be used to make the expression a bit more colorful, though I prefer ''I don't give half a (flying) fuck or better yet ''I give zero fucks!'')  
I give two fucks =  I give two fucks (nonsensical)
@_date: 2019-01-22 17:58:16
Is that a question?
@_date: 2019-01-11 08:18:58
is ''i give 2 fucks about XYZ'' equivalent to the equally puzzling expression ''i could care less''?

This drop is unacceptable. I need answers.
@_date: 2019-09-18 06:39:06
I really didn’t think so many people would fail to comprehend very obvious sarcasm.
@_date: 2019-09-11 02:11:06
@_date: 2019-09-22 15:08:36
Do you have ANY idea how mind-numbingly dumb that sounds? Can you even explain wth you mean with that?
@_date: 2019-09-11 15:42:45
3 months of sideways but really more downward movement and I don’t see anyone speculating about who is obviously manipulating the price to crash down to 10K continuously. Ffs.

When you use a double past tense and get 1K upvotes anyway.

Never take the rising BTC price for granite.
