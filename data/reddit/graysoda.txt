You could just get a raspberry Pi and have it run bitcoind (no GUI version), there around $35 USD.  The data usage is an issue if you don't have unlimited data.  It will use A LOT of data, your uploading data all the time and downloading data all the time.  Your client is almost constantly talking to other clients, downloading new blocks and sharing them with all the clients you are connected to.  You won't need a screen or keyboard except for the first time setup and updating the client, I believe.

I would recommend opening a credit union account, if you don't have one already, to buy or sell bitcoins with.  There has been many stories by people all over about sending money to an exchange from their bank account and then their account was summarily closed, no warning.  I haven't heard any stories about that happening with credit union accounts.

It's just the most recent change in ownership of the coins, all previous changes are already recorded so you can trace the coins back all the way to the block they were generated in.  This is how Bitcoin is a trustless system.  Well that and having everything secured against tampering with encryption but that's a whole other *long* post.

I'm using an Apple Time Capsule router, how would I open port 8333?
When I get to the point that I can open ports it gives me a bunch of options, UDP private and public and TCP private and public ports.  Which ones should I open?

Then I would say that bitstamp is your best bet possibly using a SEPA transfer if that works for you.  I can't really help much more since I have no experience with non-american banking

I don't think it would be a good idea to forget any block since one of the ways that bitcoins can be validated is by tracing them all the way back to the block they were generated in.  If that block were forgotten then there would be no way for someone to prove that those coins weren't injected into the network arbitrarily thus they must be assumed to be invalid.

They also take a 20% cut of what you mine as a fee for 'allowing' you to mine using their specialized software that you had to buy with the license. You can't sue them for any damages to your machine that their software might cause. If you're internet connection goes down they take 3 months of earnings in fines and if you confirm fraudulent transactions you are the sole party responsible. Etc etc

Selling my bitcoin that I earned from mining as I got them.  I started mining after the $30 bubble when they where around $4-$5.  I used to get 1 a day or so in back then, in total I've mined over 120.  I wish I had held :'(

The sender of the transaction, they are currently set around .00001 I think.  It might also depend on what wallet or what version of said wallet you are using.

They are just missing the power targets on the Single 'SC' (60GH/s) and the Mini Rig (1,500 GH/s), the little single (30GH/s) and the Jalepeno (4.5GH/s) are on target for their power requirements according to Josh.  He also says that the power requirements should be fixed once they get their new boards

When you delete a file on a hard drive it isn't actually deleted.  That space on the hard drive is just flagged  as being ok to write to again.  With some software you can scan the raw data on the hard drive and recover a private key or wallet file that way.  That's what i mean by electronic trail.  
The thing about a computer is that it can die, sometimes without any warning.  Paper doesn't have that vulnerability.  You could still lose it of course but the point of a paper wallet is that a record of the private key is never on a computer for the reasons stated above.  Offline wallet are also a very good secure solution

It depends on where you live, don't use Mt. Gox unless you live in japan.  [Coinbase]( would be good if you live in the U.S.  [Bitstamp]( from my knowledge is fairly good (especially if you live in Europe) and there's also [btc-e]( which is a Russian exchange.

Not a lawyer, but thinking of the worst possible scenario, the above statement might just mean anyone running any sort of wallet since wallets both accept and transmit bitcoins, especially full bitcoin clients.  Don't know if that's a correct interpretation but like I said worst case scenario.
@_date: 2013-12-03 03:37:20


I'm not sure about how electrum saves the wallet file either, since it says overwrite I would assume the same. 


Most printers, as far as I know, actually save the files.  I've heard permanently.  There are printer that don't save the files and actually generate a fresh private key.  The only one I know of is called piper.  It's code is open source so you can review it if you want.  


Another concern are keylogger malware (they record all your key strokes).


If you have a strong password it, for all intents and purposes, it's safe but there's always a chance that someone will get a lucky guess (the chance is ridiculously low, it make the lottery look like a sure thing).  It would also depend on the encryption scheme you use which is a bigger concern now with all the NSA stuff that surfaced.

If you do a paper wallet "properly" there isn't an electronic trail so the person would have to be in the physical presence of the wallet to steal your coins.

head over to there's a tutorial on the sidebar.
@_date: 2013-12-03 02:32:56
I can't say for other wallet clients but yeah qt does require the password for any transactions.  Or pretty much anything that you could do other than just watching those addresses.  Also you don't need knowledge of the address, you just need the private key.  With the private key you have complete control of that bitcoin address.  Let's say you forget the password or your computer crashes or something like that.  If you have the private key written down then all you need to do is import it to a new client.  If you have a backup of the wallet.dat then you need to remember the password you used with that wallet.
@_date: 2013-12-03 17:06:57
if by "use up" you mean spend all the bitcoins associated with that address then yes.  But you can still accept more bitcoins with that address and spend it again.

All right I'm going to try and give a decently concise, slightly technical explanation.  Mostly I'm going to be explaining the terminology used with Bitcoin.  Please ask for clarification on any points.
*  The term Bitcoin.
Bitcoin (capital B) is genrally used to refer to the protocol, where as bitcoin (lower case b) is used to refer to the unit of value.  
Bitcoin (the protocol) is just an internet communications protocol just like e-mail.  While e-mail allows you to send text and small files to anyone with an e-mail address and an internet connection.  Bitcoin allows you to numbers that are accurate to 8 decimal places (0.00000001).  These numbers are referred to as bitcoins and are given value because people are willing to give other people money for them.
* The blockchain
This is the distinguishing feature of Bitcoin that makes it as awesome and desirable as it is today (along with being able to be sent anywhere in the world for pennies).  The blockchain is a giant ledger that has a record of every transaction that has ever happened on the Bitcoin network ever.  It is how the system tracks ownership of bitcoins.  
* Blocks
Blocks are what make up the blockchain (as the name might imply).  They are a bundle of transactions along with a time-stamp saying that it was created at this exact time.  That bundle is then hashed (a cryptographic term, for this purpose it's basically a type of compression), if that hash is less than the current difficulty and nothing else is wrong with any of the transactions or the time-stamp contained within then the block is considered valid and distributed to all the other nodes in the network.  
* Nodes
Nodes are another term for full clients(I think, either way the explanation following is still valid).  Full clients, also called Satoshi clients (after the pseudonym of the creator of Bitcoin) keep a full copy of the blockchain, currently over 10Gb in size, on their computers hard drive.  
* Wallets and Addresses
Think of wallets as a full bank that you control and operate just for you.  Each wallet is composed of multiple addresses, addresses are like accounts.  They each have a separate balance and "password" to access them.  The "password" is the private key.  This "password" is all you need to access that account from any Bitcoin wallet anywhere in the world, the thief literally won't need anything else.  
I think that sums up most of the core Bitcoin terminology.  A lot of the other stuff is cryptology speek that I'm not comfortable giving an explanation of because it would probably be inaccurate.
Also [Let's Talk Bitcoin]( is an awesome talk show, this is the link for the new users episode.  I hope this helps :)

Thanks, out of curiosity what mining program did you use, I'm thinking CGminer
@_date: 2013-12-03 01:41:20


Think of the private key as the password to your bitcoins.  A thief doesn't need anything else to control the corresponding bitcoin address.  But yes that all you need to do to backup a bitcoin-qt wallet.


@_date: 2013-11-30 17:37:36
I suppose not, I was just trying to help him understand anything he might be reading in the future about Bitcoin.  If and when he tries to understand it better which seems to be his focus based on his post rather than just jumping in head first.
@_date: 2013-12-03 04:55:50




It could because they way qt works is that when it is first setup it pre-generates  100 bitcoin addresses.  When you spend from an address all of the bitcoins in that address have to be spent so the qt wallet selects one of the 100 addresses that you haven't used and sends them there.  You still have the coins in your wallet file you just don't know exactly which address it's in unless you look up the transaction and find it.  


You can send from multiple keys in a single transaction.


You can re-use a bitcoin address as many times as you want.


That sounds pretty good, if you do that I don't think you'll have any problems (Disclaimer: no guarantees though).
Hope that cleared some things up for you.

Purely speculating here but if you used a live CD that might work.  As for the low reward that depends on the addresses contained in the wallet, for example Ross Ulbricht's (purported runner/founder of silkroad)  wallet file is speculated to have some 600k bitcoins in it, that would be worth it to a point.  For the average bitcoin user's wallet your point stands though.
