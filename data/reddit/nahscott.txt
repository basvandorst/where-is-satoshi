Hello Reddit.
Opened my online wallet today and discovered that my balance had gone from said prior to a whopping new balance of 0.01.  
My head filled with all kinds of crazy emotions.
(emotion here) "Why didn't I do this.  
Why didn't I do that.  
Why? Why? Why..."  
I thought for a bit.  
and decided that everything will be fine.  While money is great, you can always make more. :)  I would like to share some advice for those of you who are starting to put money into BTC.
* Strong complex passwords are not as good as two strong complex passwords.
* Eggs, baskets, and such. (I still have BTC in Casascius and Coinbase *whew*)
* Thinking about making that paper wallet?  Do it.
Anyhow, emotions have been felt, lessons have been learned, and life goes on...
I will continue to invest in Bitcoin.  
I will continue spread the word to everyone I meet.  
I know Bitcoin is the future.
Thank's for listening Reddit.

Unfortunately I have no idea.  I made the mistake of trading convenience for security.

Remember back in the day, when 4BTC could get you an ipad.

I currently work in I.T. (in a fairly well known bank actually) and the rule of thumb is "updates are key."  With a system down or unresponsive we usually have multiple teams working on the actual issue, and an additional member siphoning updates to the team lead, AVP, SVP, EVP etc.
Whether there is a large, small or even no update, it tends to calms peoples nerves to see some kind of response.
As I do not foresee the transactions lessening in the near future, perhaps some kind Redditors could volunteer their services in acting as a temporary service representative with a direct line to Coinbase and provide updates to the general public?
I believe in Coinbase, I was excited the first day I was introduced to it.  Coinbase is an incredible site and will help facilitate the transition from fiat to BTC.  This site's reputation will not be ruined due to an increase of interest in BTC.
Thank you.
