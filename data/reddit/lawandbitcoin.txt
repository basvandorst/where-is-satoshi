By reading the Spanish judgment this article concludes t it is not entirely clear that the activity of sale and exchange of bitcoins is subjected to the AML regulations.
However, it can also be concluded that it does exist a necessary compliance of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations by the Financial Institutions, and, whenever that activity of exchange or sale of Bitcoins affects their financial operations (transfers bank for income payment in euros, credit cards, ATM withdrawals, etc.), those operators or companies trading activities and exchanging bitcoins must comply with the Spanish AML Act.

Telebet is just a Bitcoin wallet (which is good too). Octopocket let you use any currency (euros, pounds, dollars, canadian dollars ...) and let you convert your money into cash through more than 10.000 ATMs in Spain (at the moment).

Hi! This is what we are going to study in the following posts. The main problem is that the regulation usually run slower than the technology. This is called disruption!

This is what we are analysing in this series of posts. This problem cannot be solved linking the location to the ownership of the private key.
As you previously said, situations like this will arise. In Spain there is an obligation to declare your goods located abroad. Are bitcoins located abroad? The answer is yes and not at the same time.

You are welcome. Once we have the final judgment we will get back.

Hi tonibtc, I hope you liked the post, as you mentioned above, it was written by Alejandro, our specialist in taxation.
In our opinion, the regulations are a fact and Bitcoin companies will have to comply with them. It is true that it could be a problem for little companies because comply with those regulations could be expensive. This auditors (KPMG, Deloitte...) have offices all around the worl and know those tax and AML regulations, so the could help this kind of companies operating in different countries.

The most important part of the conclussion of the Advocate General is that she considers VAT exempted the exchange activities, but she also considers that normal transactions are not liable under the VAT regulation (this means no compliance obligations).

The article was written in Spanish and we outsorced the translation for the first time (...and last), because we were in a hurry to post the article. We are now reparing the mess.

This is not a recomendation (legally speaking). This is a conclusion sumbitted by the Advocate General before the ECJ during a procedure. 
In this context, the ECJ could agree with her or not. If the ECJ agree with the exemption, the judgment will be binding for all the Member States of the EU.

We did't do that in a mean-spirited way. We will change the image as soon as possible. Sorry for the misunderstanding.

You are right, The consultation says that Bitcoin works as "mean of payment", which is other VAT exemption listed for financial services under the article 135.1 of the Directive 2006/112/CE list. I think is great news too.

I think it depends on the screen, but maybe you are right, we will try other options. (We launched it yesterday)

Yes! It was published during this morning, now the article has a link on the word "binding consultation" at the begining of the text.

The Ministry denied the exemption as coin and/or foreign currencies (Article 4 number 8 letter b of the German VAT Law – UStG) and CONSIDERED BITCOIN VAT EXEMPT PURSUANT TO POINT C (ART. 135.1 OF THE COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 2006/112/EC as “transactions, including negotiation, concerning deposit and current accounts, payments, transfers, debts, cheques and other negotiable instruments, but excluding debt collection”.

Please note that the consultation is not saying that Bitcoin is a legal tender, but a "mean of payment". Consequently, is a financial service (VAT exempted)
