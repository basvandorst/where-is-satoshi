Before reading the article, the title made me think they impersonated the prime minister in face-to-face interactions or over the phone.
To be honest that would be a much more entertaining story than a scammer making an instagram page.

One of  the reasons for denial was manipulation. The cryptocurrency market is still pretty small and can be manipulated, but an ETF could bring new blood into market. Market size would have been expanded since crypto would have gone slightly more mainstream....
But the denial won't make a difference in the grand scheme of things anyways...

The price has been on a slow, but steady rise for the past week or so, so it's definitely possible.

On one hand, that sucks and is a huge hit to your BTC stash, but on the other hand, you now have a trailer with no payments to make. We all know the memories that  the trailer will bring your family will be better in the long run, you can earn always that BTC back!

 It's seem to a way too complicated and risky approach to profiting from a 51% attack.
