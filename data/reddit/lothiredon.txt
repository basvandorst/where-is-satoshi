Right, and why is that then. I love the way you provide constructive feedback.
@_date: 2018-01-31 08:20:19
Units please? KG? Times laid? Etc????
@_date: 2018-01-31 10:47:55
Fair enough!

Here's another article on the same website:

Said literally no investor, stock broker or entrepreneur ever.

What I deduct from that is that Monero will instead be used for shady purposes.

Knowing the UK government, it's going to take at least 2 years, one referendum and a red bus. 
Oh shit, wrong sub...
@_date: 2018-01-31 09:55:27
I'm aware but my investment is so small, it'd be silly to have it in a paper wallet. I wouldn't make any money whatsoever.
@_date: 2018-01-30 09:27:45
So what alternative would people recommend though? I hate the high fees and would like to move exchange. I have a verified account with Kraken - is that worth moving my holdings to?
@_date: 2018-01-30 12:49:58
All the old farts in the commons and lords probably hate it, or let's say "hate it". As soon as they realize they can make a hefty profit for themselves they'll exploit it.

Go on, let the bubble "burst". I'll be happy to lap up the crypto from all the panic sellers and then HODL it till the end of times.
@_date: 2018-01-31 10:48:47
Yeah, NASA going to Mars is actually a hoax, we have never been on the moon because there is a clear plastic sheet around the earth to protect the rest of the universe from contamination. 
Something called... hoo mans?

@_date: 2018-09-10 12:31:34
Ugh! Someone disagrees with me on the internet and instead of debating them, I am just going to ignore them! YAY!
Seriously, you are not humble nor a genius.
@_date: 2018-08-28 11:11:52
Same here, $10 in BTC would be great but I'll take the voucher too. 
@_date: 2018-08-09 08:12:55
But you don't then go shout that you are scared 2309 times per day
@_date: 2018-08-14 07:48:01
With all due respect, political alignment shouldn't be a reason for slating someone's arguments. 
That said, climate change denying is a different story. (:
@_date: 2018-08-29 07:46:00
Just signed up - good stuff man.

Tried it, I wasn't sold on it to be fair.
@_date: 2018-08-29 18:34:33
Sure, go for it.
@_date: 2018-08-16 07:54:19
Most certainly but the fact that 97% of all scientists agree that global warming is actually a thing, don't know. 
Oh well. I am not a climatologist so who am I to talk.
@_date: 2018-08-28 14:50:35
Didn't know that, will have a look at that. Cheers!
@_date: 2018-08-28 11:15:07
That said, I am pretty sure the FCA is working on some form of legislation that will prevent people from doing this.

This dude is the true overlord of shitposting, check his post history. Don't feed the trolls kids.

So if Goldman Sachs endorses one of their services, and Jeffrey Sprecher tells you to go buy certain stock you just trust it? Maybe it's a shit example but my god, you must be gullible.
@_date: 2018-05-04 08:59:06
Like I said, it's a rubbish example. You get the idea though. Funny how that is the only thing you deduct from what I said.
@_date: 2018-03-09 08:47:20
I guess so. It can be a bit frustrating though, if you invest your money, money you worked for (presumably), surely you'd do some research?
But yeah, it's a bit pointless to post comments like that, doesn't really solve anything.
@_date: 2018-02-01 09:54:41
400 years ago we didn't have sinks. Let that uh...
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:14:54
I have only invested 7% of my months earning. It's money that I can easily live without. Yes, I bought at $17k, but also at $12k and $10k. Regardless, if the money disappears into thin air then so be it. 
That's why it makes sense for me to HODL it, I don't mind losing it but if I happen to make a profit - wicked.
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:11:53
Oi, you are active on the Iconomi sub right? 
@_date: 2018-03-09 08:33:27
I check price / Reddit nearly every day, but the key for me is that I don't care if I have lost money, or made money. Just detach your emotions from the money and let it sit.
I hope you are playing with what you can loose...
@_date: 2018-03-08 09:06:50
@_date: 2018-03-09 08:32:06
All the people who comment stuff like unknown-person123 haven't even looked at the basics of trading.
DONT GET EMOTIONAL OVER GAINS OR LOSSES. That's like, lesson -1 pretty much.
I bought many highs and many dips - tough shit. Just riding it out for a few years and I'll see what happens. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 09:56:49
I'm not daytrading, no.
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:01:50
Here is another article he wrote. 
It looks like a very credible source... I say take this article with a grain of salt.

FYI, if people invested in companies such as Cisco and HODL'ed their shares, look at where they would be at now.
@_date: 2018-04-10 10:59:50
Go find it then and edit your post when you have.
