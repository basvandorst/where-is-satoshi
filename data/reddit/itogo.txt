I think, pay Bitcoin in retail is not more interesting due to transactions capacity. Bitcoin will go other way, like gyft.com, foldapp.com, plutus.it etc. (preload on-chain, spend off-chain).

M0+M1 = 480.000.000 BTC

I have ordered one wallet, bacause I have not smashed my iPhone, and I want to have a mobile wallet.
One question.
The App doesn't accept encrypted with BIP38 Private key.
Is it possible to generate this wallet with any opensource software? (without buying the card)
Thank you!

Dear all! It seems that I have found a solution!!!
It is a shared backups BIP38 (Shamir's Secret Sharing algorithm). Because I'm not professional, the New Open Source BIP38 Encrypted Bitcoin Wallet generator helps me
1. From my passphrase generate 3 secret shares (2 of 3 will be needed to decrypt my passphrase)
2. First share remains at me.
    Second share I will give to family members and friends (all the same) in closed envelopes.
   Third share (+encrypted private key) I will give to my notary in closed envelope, which must be open after my death.
That's all.  
@_date: 2014-01-14 09:41:06
Thank you for the great job. I'm just looking for "the perfect" long-term wallet.
Sorry for my stupid questions.

3. Is it possible to decrypt wallet or to recover a passphrase without your website (in case of shutdown)?

But I don't understand
@_date: 2014-01-06 16:26:15
Attention! After 1 day of thinking, I have got an idea:
BitGo offers the storage with Pay to Script Hash (P2SH).
User gets 3 keys: Public Key (A), Private key (B), Backup Private key (C).
A+B are able to make transactions (BitGo doesn’t have B). 
A+C are able to restore access, if B disappears, provided that C can login at BitGo.
B+C are able to restore access (no need to login).
User puts C into deposit box. Where is this box, he says to nobody, but write it down in his will and give it to notary in closed envelope, which will be opened after the death (or get amnesia? I’m not sure).
User gives the copy of part B to friends and relatives, but under the password. After X months of not logging on google, google sends to friends and relatives the password for the part B and instructions, prepared by user.
Relatives go to his notary, he checks if the user really dead (or get amnesia?), then opens the will, then they can take C from the deposit box. 
If the user is alive and has no amnesia, but from any reason some months has not logged in on the Google (for example, he is in prison, or expedition, etc. ), they will receive password of part B,  but they can’t login at BitGo, and notary doesn’t open the will, and they don’t get the C. 
Too complicated? )))))

ok. If I write "Balance in BTC", that means what you call "true debit". (1 BTC remains 1 BTC until using). If balance only in fiat, that means what you call "prepaid".  
@_date: 2015-05-28 11:56:41
Sorry, I don't understand the difference. I only understand that Xapo has balance in BTC and it will be converted into fiat at the moment of using. All other cards have balance (or card accounts) in fiat. User must load it with fiat using BTC in advance, then use. And I have written: balance in USD EUR GBP, or balance in BTC (for Xapo)
@_date: 2015-05-16 18:33:58

If tx comes with no or too small fee, merchant declines and asks for other payment. Customers pays cash and goes away. Then in two hours transaction confirmes. What's now?

Send and receive.
@_date: 2016-09-06 18:40:44
My suggestion to you: make the same as Xapo - reference card account in BTC. Real-time conversion BTC to fiat at the moment of payment at merchant. And bitcoin community will love you.

Sorry, I didn't
@_date: 2016-09-06 22:53:00
I hold my money in BTC, and don't want to sell it in advance, before I'm spending at merchant. I want: deposit BTC, charge my BTC-account in real-time as I pay at merchant, withdraw (send) BTC to another wallet. If you don't have BTC account, I must load my fiat accoint in advance (sell BTC)

as we have already discussed, don't get confused between wallets and banks. At the banks you have no direct access to your bitcoins, but to your account at third party. You have to trust them, they have full access, they can practise “fractional reserve”. They may require verification, set limits etc.
In these terms Coinbase, Circle, Xapo, (about CoinKie I'm not sure) schould be called banks, not wallet! Even though the call themself wallets

I have convinced owners of two cafes in Germany (Cologne and Mülheim/Ruhr) to accept Bitcoin. I have placed them on coinmap, and they have added the feature on yelp
