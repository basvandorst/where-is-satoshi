Just read 3 pages of that thread and it gave me a head ache. That video is a serious conference with very serious people. Your link is a personal opinion and quite deliberate trolling by linguistic analysis alone. How old are you? Please act maturely and discuss matters with objective pragmatism and not slander.

A bit too technical for me, but the explanation states its not. Maybe Darkwallet team can fix by implementing totally new strategy? Or just go ahead and adopt DRK? I mean... darkwallet... darkcoin... anonymity. Makes sense.

Good job man. Extremely informative and... err... "nitpicked" ? In a good way of course.

So much hate... Yup that's him. His handle is eduffield, and he never hid from anyone. For reference, this man has had no saturday, sundays or holidays for more thatn a year, pushing 3 to 5 updates a day when needed. A full year like a mad workaholic. You're treating him like a pubescent shitcoin cloner. This guys is a true innovator. I understand you're defending BTC's virgin's honor, but essentially DRK just solved some of BTC's major downfalls. There is even discussion on how the hell can BTC support full nodes as they are dropping like flies... At least be humble enough to do some proper research before posting like this, its not productive.

This is absolutely revolutionary! Darkcoin is now the first true fungible coin. Instant and anonymous. I am in awe
