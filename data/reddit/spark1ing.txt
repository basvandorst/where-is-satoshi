Consider it a charity going to poor miners. They need to eat too.

Suppose I have 1 bitcoin. If its buying power doubles each year, then my wealth will be 1024 times bigger in 10 years.

It's kind of scary to lose a house by just losing a private key :-)

I care about the price because the cheaper BTC the more I can buy with my salary. Besides that I don't care. I'm preparing for the future.

I guess if any kind of "bitcoin economy" is going to happen, new kinds of economic relationship will be invented.

Look at Blackcoin, it's 1% already and it's pure PoS. You can argue that it's not fairly distributed, but by the time it gets to the cap comparable to Bitcoin's it'll be pretty fairly distributed. It's going to have a very volatile rise, so most current holders will diffuse.

Werner Heisenberg, Kurt Gödel, and Noam Chomsky walk into a bar. Heisenberg turns to the other two and says, "Clearly this is a joke, but how can we figure out if it's funny or not?" Gödel replies, "We can't know that because we're inside the joke." Chomsky says, "Of course it's funny. You're just telling it wrong."

The truth is that it will be fluctuating between the two.

Who said the revolution would be easy? 
Just look at the moment, it's a truly miraculous decentralized action, happening right now: people around the world are buying in spite of all the bad news and depression. They are buying not because they are greedy, but because they are fucking pissed off by the fucking usurpers who think they can print the money and rule people.
We are exchanging the past for the future. The exchange rate doesn't matter.

One can't just openly pickpocket the whole world and get away with that. It's not a mistake, or a bug. It's a *malicious* software written by a concrete person (or group of people) uploaded to the chrome store. Somebody is going to lose a lot of money, and will naturally want to find that person. Some people will go to the police, some people will take a sawzall in their hands.

The guy who wrote these extensions is going to have some serious life-threatening troubles. There are tough guys out there that don't forget such shit.

Imagine, somebody comes into your house and says "Ok, dude, this is my house now", and shows you a transaction...
@_date: 2014-04-26 14:45:02
It's not about police, it's about finding the thief. If you can find the thief without police go ahead. I guess if somebody posts a good price for his head he'll be found very quickly :-)

Bitcoin is going to last for sure. And its lasting will be paid by those who invest in it.
Bitcoin just doesn't care about all those losers who invest in it. Bitcoin will win, everybody else will lose.

Even if those 1% are all good guys (which is unbelievable), there are infinite possible ways to steal/elicit/torture out the bitcoin from them. Don't you think the bad guys will not try it? Or maybe they have done already?
Just imagine, you're a *bad guy* (like in a role game), you know that some person possesses 1% of all bitcoins. Your task: make him transfer them to your account. How will you do that?
@_date: 2014-03-30 18:56:31
It's just the price of $ in BTC is rising. It's a temporary bubble which will burst eventually.

In case of gold and realty it actually works exactly this way. You get a cheap house and in X years you're rich. Capital is always working on those who hold. Bitcoin is no exception. 
Another question, is it going to be deflationary? Bitcoin's inflation is 11% per year now. It'll become ~5% in 4 yeas. So, if fiat becomes stable (which is a big if by itself though), we'll be able to speak about deflationary character of Bitcoin only in 15-20 years.
And yet another question: other coins are much better in this way. E.g. Dogecoin will soon mostly get rid of miner's pressure and by 2015 the inflation will be fixed at 5%. Blackcoin has 1% fixed inflation now already (!). So it may happen, that the alternatives will replace bitcoin quickly.
@_date: 2014-03-28 02:13:23
Does he know that currently bitcoin has 11% supply inflation (compared to 1.5% of gold supply inflation)?

Hey, dude, you're contradicting yourself. In one sentence you say "you're getting a cost of living decrease each year". In another sentence: "...who think cryptocurrency means everyone gets rich, and there would be no need for credit or debt? That's beyond simplistic thinking, it's just utterly, obviously wrong to the point of stupidity."
So could you decide for yourself, is bitcoin going to deflate or not? If yes, then obviously everybody gets rich. If not, then the cost of living will not decrease.
@_date: 2014-04-04 02:34:51
Well, that's what I meant actually.

Linux is exciting because it shows how cheap it can be.

1. You can prove that you made the transaction.
2. You can prove that you installed the extension.
3. You can prove that the target address is hardcoded in the extension.
I suggest you go to the police and report it. Somebody needs to find that guy.

If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it is a duck. So I suspect that China is Apple.
