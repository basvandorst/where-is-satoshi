Yes yes, you're right. I didn't mean to disregard bitcoins complete growth. 
@_date: 2017-05-12 07:16:38
Maybe if the blocksize was increased to 1GB, just to 2MB or 4MB wouldn't make any difference in the decentralization. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 19:47:14
Yes relevant.

That's why the price fell $150 after the first reports of the ransomware attack
@_date: 2017-05-18 10:04:07
No, the price fell into the 1600s after the hack

The order books are evidently thinner than for alts. That's why bitcoin dominance has dropped from 85% to 45% since March. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 06:39:39
Lots of altcoins with far faster transactions
@_date: 2017-05-20 16:46:22
Bitcoin is going up quite a bit, yes, but not nearly as much as altcoins. The current boom in cryptocurrency is avoiding bitcoin in part b/c people see that it's slow and expensive thanks to archaic technology and a divided community. It's fine when your average transaction is over $2000, but not fine for everyday needs of everyday people. 
Fix it, and price will boom. Sooner the better.

Wtf is this shitty english
@_date: 2017-05-21 13:50:35
More like people need to buy btc as an intermediary to invest in ALTs and the pressure pushes btc up somewhat
@_date: 2017-05-20 19:05:58
idc how you measure order books. Bitcoin is growing a lot less than altcoins, period. The longer it takes to reach a resolution, the more bitcoin will lose its first mover, marketing, and adoption advantages.

lol, very funny. 
@_date: 2017-07-19 12:22:36
No to 1
@_date: 2017-05-20 19:23:26
A lot of alts have better scaling than bitcoin. NEM in particular can handle 3000 t/s vs bitcoin's what, 5 t/s.

Not close to 95% of people actually agree to this, mining is just super centralized into the hands of 4 pools
@_date: 2017-05-22 02:05:27
Do people buy because they see forum comments or do they comment because they're going to buy?
@_date: 2017-07-24 07:37:26
Bcc has over 4 times the capacity as segbitcoin and only takes double the effective block size
@_date: 2017-05-20 19:11:49
Sure, long after bitcoin is overtaken and fades into obscurity. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 03:09:28
Bitcoin needs to switch to pos so that it's actually controlled by the economic majority, not 4 miners in China. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 14:35:33
There aren't any problems to solve
@_date: 2017-07-25 14:49:30
Bitcoin is splitting Aug 1st into a segwit chain and an 8mb chain called bitcoin cash
@_date: 2017-07-19 12:26:09
Fuck 2x bitcoin needs 10mb blocks or it will be destroyed.
@_date: 2017-07-25 14:40:19
Bcc is a fork of btc, btc is splitting
@_date: 2017-05-18 13:04:19
Representing the fee which isn't based on a percentage as a percentage is retarded and deceptive. Shows how desperate you are.
@_date: 2017-07-22 11:46:19
Btc is splitting regardless because of Bitcoin cash hardfork on Aug 1st to 8mb blocks. Actual scaling.
@_date: 2017-06-28 20:06:54
People are totally going to pay 5$ in fees for a 5$ purchase and then wait around for 10 minutes for the transaction to complete. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 08:09:34
And tomorrow I will be selling all 1,000,000 of my ETH for BTC. Lol. What a joke.
