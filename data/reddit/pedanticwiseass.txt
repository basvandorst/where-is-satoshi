If *everyone* removed their BTC from exchanges, then the currency would be *less* liquid, would it not?
Not trying to argue, just genuinely curious as to why you would think otherwise.

What is your point? That it is very stable in regards to the dollar?

Obviously the price per unit also matters a lot.
There is a reason that some stock prices are listed on daily news and others are not.
Most people would never even dream of buying penny stocks and that alone makes them less attractive. Also, most hedge- and pension funds have strict rules about what stocks can be in their portfolio. Basically none of them will accept anything even resembling a penny stock.
Also, if you have truly made so much money, then why the need for that snarky attitude?? It makes you sound bitter and it is (to me) one of the main problems of the crypto community. 
Edit: Cryptos will never take hold amongst the common person as long as coiners are so fucking condescending in everything that they do and say.
Just my two satoshis.

You were taking about marketing. That is another aspect.
My point is that your "the price of BTC doesn't matter, only my percentage return" isn't true. 
And now you are being condescending again.

Why hasn't the Euro experienced hyper inflation then?
@_date: 2018-08-11 20:14:16
And that is true.

I want to believe that.
I started following this sub when studying for an economics exam last year (where I chose cryptos as a subject), and I have been visitng regularly ever since. 
The general impression that I have gotten is that:
Altcoins = shitcoins (that need to die).
Cutting your losses by selling = being weak.
*Any* critisism (however justified) = spreading FUD
That, combined with an imperious and slightly condescending attitude towards newcomers and no-coiners and the whole delsuion that is:
Every course drop = pure manipulation by whales and big money
Crashes = “adjustments”
Course drop = great for BTC
Course rise = great for BTC 
For a long time I had been wondering (and I still do) whether I should sink in a month’s wages into BTC. 
But the impression I am getting here is that: 
* I am already too late
* But I should buy because it will certainly hit 220k by the end of the year
* Because it will become mainstream really soon
* Even though people more tech savy than me are fucking it up and losing their wallets
* But is is such a great technology
* That is being constantly manipulated by bots, big money and whales...
And dont even get me started on the technical analysis, lol...
I dunno what to think, really.
Back in january i called (from purely gut feeling and looking at the graph) that it would drop down to 2.5k. I think I’ll buy a coin if it does.

Buy gold or Euros or stocks? 
@_date: 2018-08-11 10:40:34


But this isn’t remotely true. And not only because it “sounds ugly” to buy a fraction of something for 5k. 
And no, I am not talking about a different subject.
The price per unit matters for a number of reasons. Also when talking about crypto currencies.
Especially when there is a limited supply of coins (like with Bitcoin), it matters a whole lot whether someone can buy up large percentages of the total coins (for whatever reason) for limited amounts of money or if that takes seriously big money.
A currency with a total market cap of just a few million dollars is *much* more susceptible to manipulation and fluctuations than one with a total market cap in the billions of dollars. 


You literally said that “price per BTC is irellevant”, which is wrong in a number of ways. 
Why do you think that BTC was on every major mainstream news channel after the bull run back in december, but not after any of the previous bull runs? 
Don’t be snarky and lecture people if you are not 100% sure that you are correct in what you are lecturing.

Your point was that the only reason that the US Dollar has not went into hyperinflation was the fact that they exported money.
Then I ask:
Why haven't the Euro gone into hyperinflation? Or the Norwegian krone? or the [name basically any currency except for the Zimbabwean dollar]? 
The fact that fiat doesn't retain value is a GOOD thing. It keeps the economy going. If inflation were negative, no one would ever want to spend anything and we might as well go back to an exchange economy (which is ineffective as hell). Like you would have to pay your rent in eggs or sacks of wheat.

Then buy silver.
@_date: 2018-08-04 18:36:24
You don’t need an international market to buy silver or gold. Also, Argentina is not some third world country, wtf?? It should be fairly uncomplicated to buy gold at market rate in any major city.
