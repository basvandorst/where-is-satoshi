FIAT beat us.

People's motive for investing in bitcoin doesn't matter. The more people buy into bitcoin, the more it fuels it's monetary value. Which means that both corrupt bankers and get rich quick idiots are helping bitcoin become the norm instead of it being some obscure technology.

"These intermediaries are safe"...  
Yeah except for when they destroyed the global economy in 2008.

God dammit, we're making so much money with bitcoin... I hate it! How are we ever going to prove it's not a get rich quick scheme!

I didn't know it existed, but this thread is full of bank shills.  
Who the hell defends banks?

Andreas was incredibly informative and rational as always, but the host was AWFUL.  
Waaay too emotional, way too biased, kept circlejerking on the same topics, ...  
What a shame. Andreas' comments were still interesting though.
@_date: 2018-06-08 09:15:26
It's clean.

Hey how do you compare these charts? Did you photoshop them underneath each other or is there an option on blockchain.com?
@_date: 2017-11-26 14:40:41
I'm just commenting because I wanna be part of this legendary thread.

That's not entirely true, because longs and shorts have to be about even since they are cash settled. 
@_date: 2018-03-22 11:40:08
They didn't literally say it's a currency. But with the way the worded it, it could be interpreted. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 15:16:51
How are you guys saying this was good?  
This was the pinnacle of ignorance. Hurt to watch.
@_date: 2018-02-28 00:06:48
Everything you said couldn't be further from the truth.  
It's very obvious that you have a VERY limited understanding of what bitcoin is. How did you even end up here. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 01:31:59
You're saying that Bitcoin's (or other cryptocurrencies') main feature is that it's anonymous.  
This is simply not true.   
First of all it's not completely anonymous and secondly the limited anonymity it provides isn't what Bitcoin is all about.  
Throw a glance at bitcoin.org for one second and you would know this.
But I'll address it anyway.  
Cryptocurrencies are naturally very transparent (way more transparent than fiat money). This is because the blockchain works as a giant public ledger that keeps track and saves every transaction ever made, for ever. A lot of criminals learned this the hard way and stopped using bitcoin for illegal activity for this exact reason.  
The only anonymity it provides is that you don't have to give up your personal info like your name, address, etc. when you use it. Which is a good thing. Privacy is a basic human right and if you think that having to give up all our privacy so that the government can have complete control over us, is how things should be, then you're a sociopath.  
And, the fact that I have to debunk this "anonymity argument" is ridiculous. It's a short sighted, pointless argument that uninformed people used years ago when the silk road was still a thing.  
Criminals use dollars every single day for buying drugs. We don't blame that on the dollar. But when criminals use Bitcoin to buy drugs, suddenly it's Bitcoin's fault.
As for the other laughable things you said...  


Yes. The greed of the banks.  
Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009 as a reaction to the global economic crisis in 2008. He felt like a decentralized form of money was necessary for people to protect themselves. Because in our current financial system, we completely depend on the banks and it's very obvious (especially since the crisis of 2008) that they don't act in our best interest.  


You gotta be kidding me right?
Constant devaluation of the dollar (and other national currencies), quantitative easing, non stop printing of money, buying power decreasing, ...  
Yeah those are good things.
I don't have a problem with criticism on Bitcoin. In fact, Bitcoin is far from perfect.  
But It's very clear that you are either misinformed or you simply haven't done your research.  
Don't shout things about something you don't know anything about.

It's like he was briefed about crypto during the silk road days.  
I can't believe such a smart man can be so ignorant. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 17:17:17
That's the whole point of bitcoin.  
So, good. It's working. They're feeling the heat.
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:26:10
A voice of reason? Get out of here.

Don't act like such a douche. This isn't r/wallstreetbets.
