lol, the oligarchy being referred to *hates* Trump, and coordinated in the most brazen way in history to try to stop him from winning power.
You are *literally* just echoing the views you've been told to have by the media that oligarchy controls. Their number one priority is to get Trump out of office.

I totally get the argument for wanting an open internet without manipulation.
I strongly get the feeling that the whole net neutrality war is just propaganda by one set of tech companies (google, netflix etc) in war against another set of companies (The ISPs) over who ends up paying the costs of infrastructure and who reaps the benefits.




I'd be more convinced by this argument if the same people making it didn't 100% support political censorship of right views by ISPs and tech companies.

Ok cool, but I mean it seems like the basic problem is that Bitcoin trading is still mainly amateur hour. Arbitrage in mature commodities makes billions from minuscule price differentials, the ones in bitcoin are enormous.
If someone was more professional about this (finding people to hire in South Korea etc) they could be making millions in short order.

@_date: 2017-12-05 19:13:07
Pretty blatantly obvious isn't it?
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:26:15
Theoretically yes. But luckily for us governments never see big paradigm shifts coming and are bad at whatever they do (hence Communist countries, where the government does everything, being shitholes).
As long as mass adoption speeds ahead of their ability to perceive the true threat of Bitcoin and legislate against it, democratic countries won't be able to ban it. (because people react quite angrily when you try to take their money away.)
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:01:31
In the even of any fork of bitcoin, current holders keep their original bitcoins (obviously), but also get the exact same amount of the new coin.
So assuming you owned 1 bitcoin and there were six forks that settled at $500 value each, you'd have your original bitcoin plus $3000 worth of forked coins.
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:34:50
Yeah it's interesting if that's the case. Of course the point of offering more money for a bitcoin is to induce someone holding one to sell, but conversely it's possible that the rising price is just convincing people to hodl.
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:33:21






Ignoring the fact that your hypothetical is just wrong, I guess you shouldn't use a Mastercard either, because Mastercard can just "say fuck you, and take all of the money to themselves"

@_date: 2017-12-24 23:44:46
Lol, you have zero evidence of that. Adoption comes in waves, and there has almost no adoption as of yet outside a tiny group of people.

The idea that the only differences between genders is "what you have between your legs" is so facile that it's barely worth even replying.
The overwhelming truth though is that whenever you look at the early days of an industry, the risk takers and creators and pioneers are 95% men. Then once something's an established corporatised business with bureaucracies full of politically correct micro-managers, then women start being appointed to positions of power because of political expediency.
I mean there's absolutely zero barriers to entry, so you can't squeal about sexism, and yet precisely how many crypto currencies have been created by women?
edit: here's an example that perfectly illustrates what I mean (though obviously from a PC, more wimmins needed perspective)
Starts off with the creators being all male;


Then once people have done all the pioneering and the business is able to carry dead weight, the corporate political correctness rolls out;

Yeah, our schools, universities, media and govt are incessantly pushing far left social justioce ideology (does literally *any* major institution fail to cite "diversity" as their highest institutional social value today?) But yeah, the problem is all those Conservative "white" guys running things lol.
Those conservative "white" guys sure are obsessed with removing themselves from positions of power, importing massive amounts of third world immigrants into every Western country and dismantling every traditional social value those nations used to hold. Those conservative "white" guys don't seem particularly interested in the interests of either white people or conservatism.

Muh anarchy! You understand we had functioning (far more ordered and fast growing) societies back when Western govts were only taking 5% of our money instead of 50% right?
I think people would be willing to give up a decent chunk of change voluntarily, and it would be quite easy to publicly identify and shame wealthy people who weren't paying their way.
Saying "who'd is in charge?" is like the logic of people in the 19th/early 20th century who said "capitalism is anarchy, imagine if a small group of people were in charge of "scientifically" centrally planning the economies, surely that would be much better!". The reality of central planning didn't work out that well.
There are so many interesting alternatives possible under crypto that would undermine the parasitism inherent in mass democracy. Maybe a vote per $500 of tax paid, so that productive and contributory members of society would have more of a say in its direction? Or a system of voluntary donation to specific areas of government, so the people decided what government would spend on by voting with their wallets.

@_date: 2017-12-17 04:50:47
Once bitcoin is at 100% market penetration, then the gain in value each year will simply be the sizer by which the world economy grows (so say 4% or so).
Not that unreasonable, although the economic paradigm will have to switch.
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:42:42


Yep, I've come to the same conclusion. Could be wrong but it seems to me like the hype as to its immediate effect is way overblown.
People seem to have crazy conspiracies about how Wall Street is just waiting to pounce and run bitcoin into the ground before buying it all up for themselves or something.
In reality though, futures in something as volatile as Bitcoin are extremely risky, since normally they're used to cover variations in a commodity of a few percent a year, not 100% in a month. Betting on Bitcoin being way up, way down, or exactly the same value as now in six months is a total guess, and getting it wrong could be enormously costly.
Institutional investors are probably going to be extremely tepid about jumping into this. If that's the case we may see a rise in Bitcoin once everyone calms down, just like we have the last few times a big event has turned out to be less important than people imagined it would be.
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:12:17
Governments like the one in Venezuela are such fucking scum. This is where the "blame rich people / businesses for all our problems and crush them into the ground" eventually leads.
If international businesses could actual trust the government to not just nationalize them the moment they moved in and started making money, Venezuela would be a prime place to start opening factories, car plants etc because of the lower wage costs, providing people who are literally starving with enough to survive.
Unfortunately as OP says, only high skilled workers can really make much use of bitcoin. I can't really think of many working class jobs which you could do remotely to get in bitcoin from abroad.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:09:16
Agreed. I think people claiming this is all due to Wall Street pump and dump are mistaken. The massive growth in subs here and Coinbase accounts suggests lots of normal people are getting in. In fact Coinbase appears to be under so much pressure from account openings that it's ID verification system failed.
Doesn't mean there can't be a big correction, but I don't think it's all part of some evil plan.
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:59:44

Were people saying "it's a bubble" every time property was brought up in 2008? Because funnily enough the main take away from that crash is that *almost no one* saw it coming. The majority of discussion about bitcoin I see these days is calling it a bubble.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:41:57


Do you understand how taxes work? If you make a big profit then sell , you pay capital gains. If you then buy and sell again with little movement, you pay almost nothing. You're making it sound like you'd somehow lose money by selling tops and buying dips unless they're absolutely massive.
The taxes have to be paid eventually so it can often be better depending on your jurisdiction to sell a certain amount every year if it's within your tax-free allowances.
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:13:58
Or their job is their passion.
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:11:42
Yeah, I was panicked the other day and on the edge of selling, but I'm completely over it now. Since most of the weak hands should have been shaken out, I'm surprised there are people who would still panic sell. I guess it could be people who aren't panic selling but are rather hoping to time the market; getting out at the start of the fall and buying back in at the bottom.
Who knows, maybe there are larger forces at work here we can't really discern. Given the mainstream adoption and big money behind bitcoin we're seeing, I'm not sure how anyone can be that jumpy.
I just wish I had enough spare cash on exchange to buy the dip if it goes lower.
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:49:19

@_date: 2017-12-22 19:39:06
the idea that's the reason for the crash is laughable. If that's why, then how come it didn't came last week?
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:01:44
If they try to play games with futures and suppress prices like they do with gold, they could be badly burnt by mass adoption though.

@_date: 2017-12-26 18:02:05
Well hopefully their play will work and the panic sellers will calm down and buy back in.
@_date: 2017-12-28 04:18:40

Most people believe that until they become an expert in a particular field, and realise that most journalists have no fucking clue what they're talking about.

@_date: 2017-12-25 00:09:20
Well given the way he presents himself as an ambassador for bitcoin, no I don't really.
And for all those who conveniently see no problem with this because his views align with theirs; how would you feel if he was publicly stating his support for Trump and donating money to the NRA? (and be honest, don't just lie and say "I'd be totally fine with it, it would influence my opinions of him at all!")

Pretty sure most of the money that's piled in over the past few months is not doing so on the basis of bitcoin becoming a currency.
Bitcoin is at the moment assuming the function of widely available digital gold.

Again, you're putting the moral imperative of shitty people's behaviour on decent people who are not responsible for it. It's a degenerate attitude, you ignore the truly culpable and guilt the blameless.
Also there s a difference between breeders and "puppy mills"..

It's the same mentality in the West, so this isn't an opportunity to take potshots.
Even with IPOs the shares are given to institutional investors and their clients first at cheaper prices than the plebs can get hold of them. There are many types of trading for which governments won't licence you unless you already have hundreds of millions of Dollars of capital.

All the people saying "You're screwed" are morons. The Bitcoin in that account belongs to you, you will be able to get it back once you've confirmed your ID to whatever degree is necessary to binance.

Yep, I was going to get in at $600, but felt like it was "too late". I totally took my eye off the ball for the last year or so, only to see some headline about bitcoin being on it's way to breaking $4000.
I learnt my lesson, so I bought in just before $4000.
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:28:21
The adoption for normal use is accelerating though, and speculation actually helps the adoption by raising Bitcoin's profile, and getting bitcoin distributed to more and more users. (for example I wouldn't have bothered to get Bitcoin if I wasn't investing in it, but now that I have it I've used it to actually pay people for things a couple of times)
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:42:28


He'd probably spit on a statist corporatist like Hillary, or a socialist like Bernie too, so if you think you're scoring some kind of partisan point you're way off.

No, your contention is ridiculous.

Cool story bro.
The internet is also based on a lot of shitty, totally outdated technologies, but that first mover advantage means it will never be surpassed, even though someone could easily build a far superior "alterna-net" today.
We've also had about 5 "bitcoin will never recover" crashes so far already.

Jeez, le Russians are responsible for everything now? Trump! Brexit! Bitcoin!

Ok Eeyore. Seriously though, Bitcoin is still miniscule; if it doesn't totally fail (a big if) it's going to be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars in five years.
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:01:11
Yes, Bitcoin is deflationary, so a new model for lending will have to be devised if it becomes a currency.
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:47:44


It doesn't have to remotely do that in order to reach more than 10x where it is now. It would have to be worth millions to start undermining the current system.
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:59:33


Well a quarter of the planet lived in misery under the first regime to ever call itself socialist, so I'd say it's not Americans that gave the word its negative connotations.

The number of new accounts at coinbase and the like suggests it's new people. I opened a Gemini account the other day and there's a three day wait for verification.

Well people will have to spend to get things they want, so no one will "only save", that would be idiotic, but people will spend less extravagantly, yes, and only invest in things that they think will get them good returns. This might lead to slower apparent economic growth, but all economic growth would be real and sustainable (as opposed to the debt fueled games that are played now to sustain Western economic growth)
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:56:30
None of those countries are socialist though. By the definition of "socialist policies" making you a socialist country, modern America and Singapore are "socialist", Nazi Germany was "socialist", 19th century Prussia was "socialist". Everywhere that has any kind of government provided service is "socialist".
The PM of Denmark actually had to publicly rebuke Bernie Sanders for rambling on about the awesome socialism he thought they had there;






Also, am from UK, we're not socialist. Our tax burden as a % of GDP is roughly the same as the US. Some of the countries on the list you cited have govt spending than the US does.
As for what they have in common, I'd suggest the most obvious thing is that their populations are almost entirely north-western European in origin.

lol, thanks for your insight, definitely didn't hear people say the exact same "this is it, it will never go any higher" thing at $6, $60 and $600.

Governments are pretty bad at responding quickly to rapid developments in technology and society. For example if they'd been told in advance what the internet would become, it would have been heavily regulated from the start, there would have been website operators licences from the FCC, special internet taxes etc. In reality though governments never saw it coming and the public was used to and expecting of an open and unregulated internet before they had a chance to get control of it.
If bitcoin takes off ahead of the government's ability to adapt, it will be publicly unacceptable in the rich (democratic) world to ban it.
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:48:49
Yeah it's annoying. I started buying the maximum weekly amount on Coinbase when it was at around $4000, and I'm still not at a whole bitcoin.
Although I suppose if bitcoin keeps rising in value to the point that you can never reach a single one, that's a nice problem to have!
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:51:12
I'm just pissed because I can't buy and it's already recovered half the fall.

Indeed, more careful and responsible handling of money by everyone can only be a good thing for long term sustainability.
It will be a total paradigm shift though, and it will be violently resisted by the people who profit from the current system though.

except those were investments in useless companies with zero value that people were fooled by.
The value and functionality of bitcoin is clear. People can see both the potential upsides and downsides. Not a bubble.

Coinbase can't "fail" like Mt Gox did, they aren't an amateur operation, they are properly insured etc.

Coinbase isn't Mt Gox. In the event of a massive failure people's money is insured and most of the bitcoin is held in offline storage.

Also depending on the terms of the agreement there can be a margin call at other times too, so you can be fucked because you're waiting for a fall in price, but the margin is called before that happens.
