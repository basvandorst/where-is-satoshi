Your comparison with gold works only if people still invest in BTC, and miners still get rewarded to pay electricity bills. I think in a few years from now, other cryptocurrencies (faster, more use cases, lower transaction fees) become more interesting to be the store of digital value. If that happens, the store of value becomes store of less value every day.

Hi guys, I started my interest in crypto because of BTC in 2017. I believe BTC started a revolution which is still in the beginning. I did a lot of reading and the largest con of investing in BTC was the large energy consumption (like the yearly energy consumption of Chech Republic). Could you please give me some arguments why you are still supporting BTC, while it uses such a large part of energy in these times of global warming? I really try to understand it, and I like to hear the story from both sides. On the one side I think you can read some great arguments by u/hodor7777 [

I think you meant that China (BTC mining country  is targeting to increase renewable energy by 75% in 2030. Targets and reducing energy consumption are not very good friends.
