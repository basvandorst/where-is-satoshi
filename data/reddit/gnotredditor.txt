I wish he wouldn't release the code, no one needs to waste time looking at it - it is more than likely a pile of useless rubbish. If he plans to help the community by doing this the only thing necessary to release would be the server logs, but in all honest this is probably a really stupid thing to do also. 
Moot didn't release the source for 4chan because he's sitting on a goldmine, it is really just a trashily coded website with nothing of interest. The less people that spend time looking at it the better.

It depends, with 4 per though the system total shouldn't be far off from 850W to my knowledge.

I wouldn't be so sure, I bought my mining equipment two months ago and I'm turning a profit now (without selling any of the equipment). I also have 10 months to pay the balance on the equipment, so I expect bitcoin's value to increase in the duration. The equipment hasn't lost any value either, some of the cards are worth more than when I bought them. If the price of BTC doubles twice more he'll make his money back within the year some way or another, even with the current insane pace of difficulty increase. Besides, who doesn't want 80 graphics cards? I bet it can even run Crysis. Worst case scenario it becomes uneconomical and he can start an ebay computer store specializing in 5830's and recoup most of his investment.
There aren't any incredibly economical cards in the pipeline that I am aware of either (from a mining standpoint), and cost efficient FPGA are still a distant dream. So barring some company that we've never heard of releasing a groundbreaking new gpu, I don't see any real issues with the investment. 
TL;DR actually seems like a pretty safe investment as far as hardware gambles go. Everyone around me told me the same thing when I bought and I'm doing fine.

I too am impressed that we have twice now attracted the attention of one of my favorite economists, he seems to be beginning to understand the promise of a p2p crypto-currency. Bitcoin is the most interesting economic experiment of the past century, whether the network itself survives is of little consequence as the protocol it has spawned will undoubtedly have long-reaching implications.

You probably overspent on the PSU's, but given the labor involved with setting up that many computers and assuming this is a one man operation.. I approve of the purchase.

Share with me that given the current economic climate where exactly would be a better place to put $20k? The dollar MIGHT have bottomed (probably not), interest rates are non-existant, gold is at an all time high, oil is showing signs of faltering, silver is way overpriced, none of the major currencies are showing clear signs of movement, the stock market is stagnant, I guess land is looking pretty good right now but other than that I don't see any clear oppurtunities, and certainly nothing else short-term not for $20k. Going short is the only really smart position to take right now, and it's not really that brilliant becuse the economy might improve any month now - but this rally can't go on forever. It would be a good time to open a pawnshop or a Mcdonalds but I don't think $20k is going to cut it.

Having not used Elgius I would not recommend it to a new user as not only is it a smaller pool, and I have not personally dealt with it but also because I have encountered a few negative posts concerning the pool's operators on the forums, and one [here]( on Granted this could just be some users with an agenda, I am just passing on what I have encountered.

It would depend on how much and what kind of other assets I had. Bitcoin certainly has greater reward potential but there is also greater risk, especially considering $20M would buy you 1/5'th of the supply currently and 1/10'th of the total supply. I would be uneasy holding so much of any commodity unless my other assets were in relatively safe investments and I had at least $200M.

It is reasonable, I recommend to all my gaming friends that they participate in the project as they have a chance to participate in something new, and exciting as well as recoup some of the investment on their costly rigs. Setup should take about 30 min to 1 hour. I will summarize the required steps as well as point you to [this guide]( should you require more detailed instructions for any of the steps.
Seeing as this is a gaming rig I will correctly assume you are using Windows, windows fortuneately is the easiest operating system to start mining on.
1. setup port-forwarding on your router for ports 8333 (bitcoin client) and 8332 (most mining pools) to your computer.
2. download and install the [bitcoin client]( 
3. Start the bitcoin client, it will create a wallet.dat file which contains your public-private keypair (do not share this file with anyone, encrypting this file is recommended but to get up and running it is best to skip this for now). 
3. After the client has started you should immediately close it, you do not need to download the entire block-chain until you wish send coins although it is recommended you do so before withdrawing proceeds from mining so you can make sure everything is working properly.
4. download and extract [guiminer](
5. This is probably the most complicated step: select a [mining pool]( and create an account if neccessary. I recommend starting with Btcguild as I have found it to be a nice balance between useability and pay-out but there is of course many pools including one run by fellow reddit users Mt.red :&gt;. I have created an account at Mt.red and having now remembered it I will likely be replacing deepbit with it as my alternate. [optional] see *** Mining-pool rant *** for additional information.
6. Start guiminer.exe
7. File&gt; create new miner &gt; new OpenCl miner (this is poclbm)
8. Enter the necessary information and Start Mining! Assuming you are using btcguild with pocblm the following information should suffice: 
    + Server: Btcguild(any)
    + Username: the workername you create on the btcguild website
    + Password: your worker's password 
    + Device: [0-0] Cypress     (this is your videocard)
    + Flags: -v -w 128 -f 1       (these are optimization flags that are sent to poclbm which are recommended for your card on stock clocks. -v verbose, -w 128 worksize 128bits, -f is the aggresion setting 1 being the highest. With -f 1 your computer will not be useable, so if you are using your computer for browsing and would still like to mine you can likely set -f 60 instead of -f 1 and it will still be perfectly useable, though there will be a slight performance penalty - for more information on this setting consult the poclbm readme). 
9. (optional) download MSIafterburner and overclock your graphics card to get more hash :&gt;, 6950 really only reach their potential after they have had their bios flashed, you can get up to  (if you are interested in this step simply reply to this comment or send me a pm and I can help you, some 6950 are perfectly safe to do this on others are not, although all of them can be safely moderately overclocked with no risk of damage using MSIafterburner). See: 
10. Profit! Calculate your profits here:  Assuming: 24/7 operation, 350khash/s, 11.5 cents/kWh, 400W system draw, current difficulty and exchange rate you can expect to earn ~3 BTC per month.
    + Power cost per time frame: 33.60 USD 
    + Revenue per time frame: 62.92 USD
    + ... less power costs: 29.32 USD
Please not this guide is by no means the safest way to secure your wallet.dat file, but this will get you up and running ASAP. After you have your system up and mining you should think about creating a new wallet.dat securely using [this guide](
*** Mining-pool rant ***: I personally started mining solo about three months ago, and after finding no coins after a couple days I wisely joined deepbit. I immediately was earning a little over 2.5 BTC/day with my 1.6Ghash/s and within a week I made the effort to switch to a small and now defunct pool that used an RPC interface called continnuumpool at which I was earning ~ 3.4BTC/day. Currently I am using btcguild and deepbit if btcguild is down but I will be switching my alternate to a smaller pool as deepbit's userbase has grown dangerously large (security risk for bitcoin in the long-run), or if I find the time I will setup a [mining proxy]( I would recommend against using deepbit at this point as though it was by far the best UI for a mining pool I had encountered back then, they never had the best payout and there are many comparable sites with equally good user-interfaces. It is recommended you use a larger pool at least to start as the pay-outs are very consistent and it will be easier to track your progress. You should choose your mining method and mining pool based upon your own personal prefrences. I personally recommend you start on btcguild as it has a very clean interface, is not the largest pool but it is sizeable enough for you to be more or less guaranteed returns and it is donations based so pay-outs are very good. Both deepbit and btcguild have suffered DDOS attacks while I have used them, but both recovered within hours. 
Remember, there is nothing tying you to any pool other than the minimal time you spend creating accounts and setting up your miner to work with them, and you can always devote your miner to a new pool at the click of a button so trying multiple pools is recommend. All the pools are run indepdentantly and have different operators, services and philosophies. PPS (pay-per-share) will pay-out each valid share you contribute at a fixed rate and usually charges a higher commission, prop. (proportional) will pay-out proportionally based upon the number of shares you contributed vs. the total number of shares the pool solved to solve a block. Proportional charges a lower or no commission but there is variance as there is no guarantee that your pool will have the winning hash-sum for a block, so some days you earn more, others you earn less - this method is recommended only if you are using one of the larger pools. Additionally, after creating an account it is often necessary to create workers and assign passwords although not for all of them. Any of the larger pools which you are recommended to start with (deepbit,slushpool,btcguild, etc.) manage this through the website interface, after creating your account and logging in locate the manage workers section on the site and create a new worker.

There are no currently workable FPGA solutions that will beat a GPU cluster on a cost basis, only on an electrical one. In the USA KW/h is around $0.10 if you're using coal and each of those rigs will put out ~1.5GH/s for approximately $61.20 in electricity costs per month (assuming 850 W per system). Electricity will only be a concern after three or more difficulty increases and that is only if the price per coin does not increase which it undoubtably will. FPGA will only be preferable investment if the difficulty continues to increase and the price per coin does not, and given how expensive they are and how illiquid the market is I would not be anywhere near as confident in that investment even when the time comes to consider it. The GPU's have a very large and liquid secondary market (gamers). The investment required in an FPGA is six to eight times that required for an equivalent GPU cluster, and FPGA and ASIC are likely to remain unattractive on a cost basis for the next ~2 years, although I am aware there are new solutions entering the market we will have no idea of their potential until someone has them crunching. 
One must also consider the time to get an FPGA working, those 5830's will be all humming within three days since everything is off the shelf and the software for gpu mining is very simple to work with at this point.

How would such a service comply with Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act in the United States or similar such measures in other countries? The reason I have never used such a service is that either such services are illegal where I live or the services themselves have not provided sufficient evidence to me that their services are legal. While I have at times desired total anonynimity in certain online purchases, the purchases themselves were legal and I have no interest in violating the law as well as paying an exchange to launder my money simply for the sake of total anonynimity. 
Blind Bitcoin even states on their website "Because Blind Bitcoin Transfers relies on strong cryptography, there is no need to trust me not to release server logs. Even if I kept logs (which I don't) and turned them over to the authorities/mob/nosy neighbor and the authorities/mob/nosy neighbor used the most powerful supercomputers in the world, it would still take an unreasonably long amount of time to compromise your privacy. (The exact amount of time varies from decades to hundreds of thousands of years depending on who you ask. See these pages: 1 2 3) ", this is clearly not legal for a financial institution in my country.

Whether bitcion is currently an officially recognized currency or not seems irrelevant to me as such a business as you are attempting to create would certainly qualify as a financial institution. I would be glad to use your service if you could provide sufficient evidence that your service would provide me anonynimity as well as comply with any local laws in both of our countries, something which I currently believe to be impossible but am open to being corrected on. I would also not do business with your service if you took on customers that may be putting themselves at legal risk even if you are in your host country breaking no laws.

You are going to pay quite a premium if anyone offers such a service. The reason for this is that paypal and credit card charges can be reversed while bitcoin cannot. This creates a vulnerability in any exchange that allows payment through such methods, so they must charge extra to offset the inevitable costs of future charge-backs.
