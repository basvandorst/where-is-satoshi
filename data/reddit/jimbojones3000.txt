Yet another crypto scam.. they are starting young now these days..

The prices for all coins is based on simple supply and demand.. nothing else.
Often it's hype and marketing that creates this demand, which causes a bubble when there are no more greater fools.
Personally i invest into coins that are based on businesses and blockchains that can have Dapps built onto them.. and nothing else.

So if BCH becomes the main bitcoin, that means the other bitcoin you just bought would be worthless.
In fact you would be holding nothing, and lose all of your money.

Does anyone not see the problem with bitcoin magically becoming something else.
What about the investors who are not watching.. they wake up with 0$ value.
Awesome idea. This place is full of geniuses.

Haha i don't blame you.. i think if i had 200k in bitcoin sitting in some random internet account i would be stressing too!

Has anyone ever thought.. bitcoin could just be a scam made by the rich to take the last few bucks we have left LOL..
They already made the jobs pay shit, food expensive, housing unaffordable.
Maybe this is just the last FUCK YOU from the elite, to take our last tiny bit of money.
MAYBE :P

Buy a coin for $1.
Wait till it rises to $100.
Loan that $1 coin out, now worth $100
ROI from your $1 is now around $300, plus you have payments coming in daily now.
People are making some good money, but like all of these cryptos it's very risky.

I see the cult of bitcoin does not like to be confronted with the truth.
I only say this so something can be done.
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:02:25
I second that.. meh.
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:33:14
I am not trolling.
Got down voted right away.
Are you guys not open to discussion?
Gonna be like cult members an ignore the truth?
Im just saying someone should fucking fix it.

The way to get everyone to use bitcoin.. is to make people use it without knowing they are using it.
An example could be an ATM card with no fees. Users can just deposit money via a web portal and pay for stuff, but on the backend it's bitcoin or some other crypto.
Automatic buy / sell orders by the billions, and people don't even need to know it's blockchain powered.

Mathematically it could hit 1 million.
Take emotion out of the equation.. look at the numbers.
From what i remember bitcoin needs to do about 15% of global trade and it will be worth 1 million.
It's certainly possible.
@_date: 2017-10-20 22:25:45
But don't sell when the price goes down.. it always comes back up.
I buy coins when these crashes happen ;)
