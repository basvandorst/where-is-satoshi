This part is terrifying - Having made thousands of trades on the exchanges that there is no record whatsoever of at this time, I am scared of losing everything. I don't want to ignore my tax liability, but am afraid to report for fear of these penalties. I have a benchmark in late November where I converted all my crypto holdings to bitcoin and sold them using Coinbase. I thought I would use my investment dollars as a cost basis and that payout as a gross sale and just treat it like one short term stock investment. Without records available is this the safest way to go?
I had several audit/report triggering situations arise as well that will further complicate things: 
More than $10K value in BTC-e.com (a foreign asset?)
Transfers via Coinbase of more than $10K

I offer both, have made hundreds of cash deposit sales, zero offers to meet in person. Simple as that. You can sell to the entire world or to the people down the street who think Obama is coming to take their Medicare and guns.

He has no trades on the account that made the comment. You can create as many accounts as you can emails.

Hopefully instead of just deleting his accounts they find a way to catch this guy.

Because they probably paid for it with a stolen credit card.

Thankfully this was fixed 8 hours ago per their Twitter ETA.

102 BTC IMHO is enough to put away in cold storage, get on with your career and forget about it for 10-15 years, and retire a multimillionaire.

In case you were wondering the Bitcoin address on the pictured keychain:

It's not peculiar at all - That is how it works. It's called a "hot wallet" and it's only used to identify whose account the deposit should be credited to. Now transactions that occur within silk road will be off-blockchain, instant, and without fees. Every auction site and every exchange does it this way.

I think I would have a contract stipulation wherein day-to-day tips would be untouched, but if horny professor moneybags leaves more than a $100 tip for my hot young hostess, she pays the fee.

The AAplle Pro Plus Ultra-mega stand is $9 on eBay. Use the rest to buy Doge.

I would have denied it too. It would be extremely risky for people to know you had access to $500M in bitcoin that they can have if they just kidnap you or your family...

I've lost thousands day trading altcoins--so that makes me a professional! :) I don't recommend it for everyone...

There is no way to short outside of margin and 2.5x profits are nice. Just have to have stop loss orders in place to limit loss potential.

Unverified personally, but I've got screenshots of the qr codes and hope that is sufficient to reset them on a new phone.

What is the current status on these? Have any shipped at all yet?

I transferred everything I have to Coinbase last night, sold ~ The transaction has a status of "complete" but obviously it will be about a week to see the money in the bank. I should be good right?
I figured it had bubbled high enough and even if it went higher, it would certainly fall well below $1K again soon. This way I can pay taxes on cost vs. sell with least complication and buy back in next year.

That was my first step. 10BTC limit followed by a week of waiting for my coins and before I can do anything else. So I went to localbitcoins. Now I'm limited by how much cash I can withdrawal each day from the atm.

I took out a $3K (no interest for 1 year) loan when the price was $190. Funds cleared the morning of the price hitting $260. I bought immediately. I am an idiot.

Remember remember the ~~5th of November~~ 1st of December. 2nd biggest Bitcoin crash in history!

I sold everything the day after Thanksgiving. The pain of fees, delays, and limits as I changed my mind and decided to buy back in has shown why there is not more investment in Bitcoin. It needs to be A LOT EASIER to buy this stuff before it will actually become mainstream!

This is terrible news. What then is the cheapest, most efficient way to get USD out from Bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-02-16 02:20:33
Traditional exchanges are afraid of Bitcoin, so refuse to do business with other exchanges dealing in bitcoin. (With few exceptions). Setting up an account with Dwolla, and linking it to Mt. Gox has been the easiest way for me so far. 
@_date: 2013-04-15 02:10:07
There's no way I would trust a blind purchase like that. Always put it in Gox and trade for specific rates!
@_date: 2013-04-23 15:44:12
So...300K cash for Bitcoins...what do you do and how do I do it too?
@_date: 2013-03-24 19:04:37
I wish MtGox would get a more robust trading platform - Allowing things like trailing stop orders (sell if it drops xx% or $xx from high value). I would do more trading if they did.

The internet is a fad. Once it dies, so will bitcoin.
