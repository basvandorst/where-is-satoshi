Im actually really curious about these people who always view taxation as something they should not be obliged to pay. Have they never gotten primary education for free? Or maybe childhood vaccination for some low low price? Has their grandparents not gotten a continuous pension? 
It's fine to say we should leave taxation but we should know what we subject ourselves to otherwise, extremely high prices of medical attention (hospitals could charge a dollar a second of they so desire) and education would be insanely expensive among other things. Without governments we would be more efficient but then who would regulate things like crime? Without governments there would be contracts to kill and those contracts would be okay.... Is that okay with you guys? Without regulation big pharma would charge you $10000 for a common flu pill.... Would that be fine? I'm genuinely curious.

Even if the dollar value was much less, you would have been must better holding on to BTC. That is the nature of Bitcoin. If you paid 5BTC per share even when it was $20 per BTC for a total of $100, you would not have gotten back enough returns for it to be worth the investment as the 5BTC today would be approx $2500 today.

Thanks for your reply, always look forward to well thought out rebuttals.
In ECON101, we learn the first basic model where price = marginal cost. This is perfect competition. We learn that first, before moving along into other models like monopoly, oligopoly, monopolistic competition, etc. Similarly, I argue that, first we need to know how things would be in perfect competition (more so in a bitcoin world without regulation and free market entry) before moving on to other market models.
There is no free GDP from population growth. But if I, as an individual can hire 10 singers at my birthday, population growth in singers mean I can now higher more for the same amount. In fact I would argue, GDP = value of all goods and services produced. This means GDP = amount of goods (can be labourers which comprise of growing population **n**) multiplied by the price. The GDP in this world grows because both the amount of goods and services grows along with the currency. In a bitcoin world, currency is capped. GDP = constant and can never grow while goods and services grow. GDP = 1 which needs to be divided into more and more population, unless of course you want new borns to simply not have any welfare. I would say in a market where currency is capped, there can be no nominal GDP growth because we are multiplying a growing number of goods and services with an ever decreasing price (deflating). Price can't grow, why? because there is a cap on currency. We cant pay price = 2 when there is only 1 currency ever.
Let me clarify 
1. Currency = 1 infinitely divisible. Similar to bitcoin, just limit it to 1.
2. Suppose some big firm get endowed (start out with) 0.9 currency with other **N** small firms sharing the balance, 0.1. (Note that I'm not saying this is free capital, it is theoretical to when the world only runs on a currency that is capped. Having someone endowed with such a huge proportion of a limited currency is not unlikely, think Satoshi, think Winklevoss twins, etc)
3. Let market be perfectly competitive. Unlikely situation but a requirement of the model due to my first paragraph.
4. Firms can invest a sum of their capital to get some returns next period. If the returns are positive, then **because there are no regulations and it is a free market**, other firms will enter, so firms can only invest up to a point and that maximum point is when investment equals the returns. 
5. Now, because *I=R*, the decrease in their balance sheet stems from the following example:
 - I could invest my 0.1 currency today to get 0.1 worth of returns next period.
 - However, I can't continue spending 0.1 currency to get 0.1 worth of returns next period, why? Because there is going to be more and more people who we will need to divide a smaller portion of the pool. 1/n as n grows, n is going to get a smaller and smaller portion.
 -  Thus, if I keep investing, the return I get the next period is going to get smaller and smaller in terms of currency. So in terms of currency balance, it is going to get smaller and smaller as I start out with 0.9, invest 0.1 get a return that is less that what I invested.
- Thus, I prefer to hold onto my currency and don't invest. I don't invent the iPhone, I don't invent new cancer curing drugs, etc. Social welfare does not improve.
Hope this is clearer. Would also appreciate if you could write out the model you think would be suitable in a manner such as I have in that forum post so that valuable critique can happen. Thanks. :)

@_date: 2013-05-22 11:00:50
[Re-posting]( here in the hopes that I get a reply. The following is a theoretical example with arbitrary values of inflation/deflation and price:
The argument that deflating prices are bad stems not from smartphones depreciating in value, i.e.
Year | Good | Price | Price | Price
:-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-:
2012 | iPhone 5 | 600 | | 
2013 | iPhone 5 | 400 | |
 | iPhone 6 | | 800 |
2014 | iPhone 5 | 200 | |
 | iPhone 6 | | 400 |
 | iPhone 7 | | | 1000
The incentive to spend here is simple, in 2011, you hold an iPhone 4, come 2012, you have 500 fiat in your hand and the decision is whether to buy the newly released iPhone 5 or not. Because you know there is inflation, your 500 next year and the following year will not be enough to buy a newly released iPhone, knowing that, you buy the iPhone 5 on release. Apple makes the money now and invests in R&amp;D because they know they will be able to sell the next iPhone for a price higher than it was last year (due to inflation).
No one is arguing that consumers will STILL have to consume to survive and that goods today will hold lesser value in the future (normal good). The argument being made is as follows:
Because bitcoin is capped, newer and better goods are cheaper relative to their older counterparts, more goods and services to go around with the same amount of currency (divisible infinitely though finite):
Year | Good | Price | Price | Price
:-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-:
2012 | iPhone 5 | 600 | | 
2013 | iPhone 5 | 300 | |
 | iPhone 6 | | 400 |
2014 | iPhone 5 | 50 | |
 | iPhone 6 | | 100 |
 | iPhone 7 | | | 200
This is just an example of the deflation that (keynesian) economist say will bad when prices deflate. Not that older goods lose value over time. In the second table, most people will wait to spend their money because why buy the iPhone 5 for 600 today when the iPhone 7 brand new would cost 200? Saving up the 600 that you are going to spend today means you can buy 3 new iPhone 7's at release. The *opportunity cost* of buying an iPhone 5 today is 3 new iPhone 7's 3 years later (or a 2 year old iPhone 5 with 450 to spare and all combinations of goods therein).
People spend less -&gt; knowing that, businesses innovate less, because why spend the R&amp;D today if the price of your newer good is going to sell for relatively cheaper than your old product? Overall welfare will be lower.
P.s. prices are chosen arbitrarily to reflect deflation in prices of newer goods in the second table and to reflect the reduction of value of the same good in the future in the first table.
Hope I get a well thought out reply that can rid me of this thinking.
*Edit: More formal example follows.*
1. Assume perfect competition (reasonable assumption for analysis), no firm invests (**I**) today unless tomorrows revenue (**R**) is higher than the investment.
2. Higher **I** in a prior period results in higher **R** in the next. At any **I &lt; R**, firms make a profit the next period, new entrants can enter and invest some (**I + small amount**) such that **R &gt; I + e &gt; I**.
3. In perfect competition, **I = R** because both firms (or any number of n firms) will invest up to a point just below **I &gt; R**.
4. Limit currency to 1 (divisible infinitely). 
5. Population **n** and amount of total goods **x** is growing.
6. Because *4* and *5*, then **1/n** and **1/x** is decreasing. Population **n** has to spend **1/x** on goods each period.
7. Assume perfect information and **n** buys all **x** goods produced by firms.
8. Because **I = R**, firms investing gets a smaller and smaller balance sheet as the time period increases infinitely.
9. Knowing that, and playing the game from 1 to 8, firms hold onto their money instead of investing.
10. *9* is especially apparent if for example one firm is starts out the game endowed with a significant proportion of the currency. E.g. If any one firm holds 0.9 currency (arbitrary value), there would be no way any competitor can invest and come out on top because the sum of money = 1.^*
11. Hence, no investment.
^* Note that the current distribution of Bitcoin is also skewed with a smaller proportion holding a significant amount. Read: [Distribution of bitcoins by addresses](

@_date: 2013-05-28 03:34:40


Because you have said that, I believe you have not actually read my post (


Never ever said Bitcoin causes I &gt; R. I said firms will invest **IF** I &gt; R, irregardless of Bitcoins. Firms invest if future revenue is more than current investment. But because of perfect competition, more firms enter so investments become less and less rewarding up to a point I = R, why is this the point? Because no one will invest when I &lt; R. **I have never stated: Assume I &gt; R and I = R, because that would just make no sense.**
You might want to get your reading right? :P
What is growth to you? GDP? GDP = quantity of goods and services X price of goods and services.
Our economy currently: quantity is growing X price that is increasing = GDP is getting higher every year.
But in an economy where currency is capped, quantity of goods grows while price continues declining, why? **Because currency is capped**. IF GDP = constant, is that growth? 
I just gave you a reason why there can be no growth when the currency is capped.

2013 | iPhone 5 | 299 | |

Because I assure you when that time comes in the future you will be here saying "this emerging crypto currency is in the hands of a few people" yet again if you yourself have not collected those coins prior. 
The reason why you think 15 people have 80% of the coins is because they risked their time and money in procuring bitcoins through buying them directly from a miner or by mining themselves...why didn't you do it? If you say "cause you did not know if bitcoins will get so successful and did not want to risk your time and money" then what will make this **next emerging cryptocoin** be any different to you personally in terms of distribution?

This exactly. And then you will have people saying if you don't own the private key for your Bitcoins then you don't own your Bitcoins at all. Which is a true statement but nevertheless makes current and future Bitcoin owners weary of any future Bitcoin projects because there is no accountability. Bitcoin supporters are usually free market thinkers, let there be no government intervention. In that case, many people are going to get fucked over multiple times and there is nothing they can do about it. Its fine to not want government intervention when nothing bad happens to you but when it happens to you, that's when you want something done. As a Bitcoin holder, this is the dilemma that we have, how do we have a completely free market while having at least some security from things like a company losing your Bitcoins? If you say that keep Bitcoins secure in an address with a private key that only you control and store that private key away, then its much more convenient to have traditional internet banking where we can be pretty confident that all our money isn't going to get stolen one day by the bank suddenly because of hacking/inside-job (although I do know banks have been known to confiscate balances but that risk remains much smaller than one brought upon by some future Bitcoin bank).

Suppose you were buying something from silkroad. Law enforcement officials are hunting those who buy drugs. They could, set up a seller account and sell said drugs for a specific amount, lets say 0.91918181 BTC. Once they get a buyer, they generate a bitcoin address, send it to the buyer. Buyer sends that specific bitcoin (using bitcoin-qt) payment which generates a transaction ID. Transactions are public, hence its possible for law enforcement to look up the transaction ID and thus guess the location (not pin point accuracy, but maybe suburb, city, etc) of the buyer without the buyer sending an address. Is this correct?

A good point. A finite pool of money causes the decline in prices. Remember, a growing number of goods and services have to be priced in according to some finite number of money supply. In the current production-consumption, apple spends X amount on R&amp;D to sell iPhones at P1 next year. Because of inflation, P1 &gt; X, and so they do it. 
In an all bitcoin economy, apple spends Y amount on R&amp;D to sell iPhones at P2 next year. Because of deflation, P2 &lt; Y, and so they do not invest. Consumers know that apple will not innovate, so they buy at P2. But because the money they get now will always be larger than some other P3 in the future apple can get from spending Y on R&amp;D, so they will not innovate, and innovation stagnates.

Basically utility maximising individuals will not spend bitcoins on things you can buy using fiat even if you buy bitcoins for just in time purchases i.e. I want to buy a $50 item where the seller accepts Bitcoin so I spend $50 at coin base to get the bitcoins to pay. Why? Nobody wants to be the next 10000 Bitcoin pizza guy. At least not me.

Reasonably everyone who wants to buy will buy when it drops. If it drops to 28, good, buy, if 25, awesome, buy! But what if it doesn't drop? What if it increases to 32 and never falls back past 31 or something? Questions only you can answer.

Don't think it really matters what the price of Bitcoins will be when making an investment. Suppose you bought a 60GH/s miner for $2000 today and get it tomorrow, you start mining and because of the difficulty you only ever get to mine 10 BTC in total which hypothetically will be worth $1000 each, your future networth would be 10BTC X $1000 = $10000. However if you spent that $2000 on just buying Bitcoins today $2000/$150 = 13.33BTC which is obviously more than 10BTC.

Ignoring payout methods, non-increasing hashing rate, technology and the others, the larger the proportion of the entire network, the more likely and frequently you get a payout. As an example, why won't you mine solo? When you do find a block, you get 25 BTC all to yourself. That's because the chances of you doing so are so minuscule (e.g. 0.000001%) it would take 10 years to find a block (if you're lucky). So people pool together to get 10% of the network and share the blocks they find. Although the expected return is the same over time, i.e. you can get 25 BTC by the end of that 10 years by pooling, people rather get rewarded consistently for a smaller amount than rewarded infrequently for a larger amount. 
*25 BTC after year 10 or 2.5 BTC each year for 10 years?* I would think most would choose 2.5 BTC each year for 10 years rather than wait the 10 years with no annual payout.
The example above shows that it is better (not in terms of payoff and the end of year 10 but in terms of more frequent payments) to be in a pool of 10% that be a solo miner of 0.000001% leads us to the following: miners rather be a smaller player in the largest pool for the most frequent payments and leading from that; the larger the pool, the bigger it gets.
As long as pooling behaviour leads to more frequent payments (not necessarily more in quantity) and pool operators show no malicious behaviour, the market will lead to this type of large pools.

Sorry but I don't get the rationale behind that. Why would I spend the 1 BTC today to buy a 1 BTC good when I know a month later I have 2 BTC to buy 4 goods at 0.5 BTW each (assuming deflation in the price of pens).

I do think we still need governments in some cases though it will be a long while before Bitcoin can compete with fiat thus taxing will be quite far into the future. The issue most people have with fiat and the government is that essentially the *government (through the fed) prints money* and thus have too much control over the money supply. 


Although there will only ever be 21 million Bitcoins, each Bitcoin is divisible up to 8 decimal places so the smallest unit is 0.00000001 BTC (or 1 Satoshi) meaning there will be a lot of currency to go around (about 2 quadrillion Satoshis).


Even without Bitcoins, all these things are already happening, even within the government. With Bitcoins however, we distribute the power that a handful of people have of printing/supplying currency to the masses.
Inflation is a self feeding machine. Things are more expensive because wages are higher, wages are higher because people need to buy things which are more expensive because wages are higher.

What about the number of online wallets which would be equivalent to be banks in that it stores your Bitcoins getting hacked recently and losing millions of Bitcoins? Also remember that since there is no regulation (in the world of Bitcoin), then whats to prevent a 'Bitcoin Bank' from shutting down and running away with your Bitcoins? As they always say, you need to store Bitcoins your own or else you don't fully own them. Don't think this has been addressed yet.

Yes I know time preference affects decisions we make though the answer depends on the utility an individual gets from consuming today compared to the utility tomorrow.


Profit margin can remain the same. Suppose cost decreases every period after R&amp;D and so does price (seems like a reasonable statement from your post). Continuously decreasing price means my balance sheet gets smaller and smaller every year in which case I would be better off not investing in the first place. Example:
1. Let currency limit be 10 (divisible infinitely).
2. Apple starts out endowed with 5 currency.
3. Apple sells 10 iPhone 3's at 1 currency. Their margin is 10%, so they make 0.1 currency.
4. Balance sheet = 5.1
5. R&amp;D = 0.5 (assume half of revenue last period).
6. Selling 10 iPhone 4's (at a price less than the iPhone 3, we both agree on the price going down), gets them 0.8 currency. At 10% margin, they make 0.08 currency. 
7. Balance sheet = 5.1 - 0.5 + 0.08 = 4.68 &lt; 5.1 
Note that in my formal example above, R&amp;D = Revenue next period in perfect competition. So 5, would actually be 0.8 making them even worse off.

I know you can generate new addresses. But looking at that link shows that they can geo locate transactions through your ip. For example I use tormail to send an email to a buyer with a bitcoin address. It is anonymous. But when the buyer sends bitcoins to my bitcoin address, they can pinpoint me down to a country and to perhaps a narrower scope.

A depositor puts 10 BTC into your bank. You then lend out 1 BTC each to 9 different borrowers. You're now doing fractional reserve banking with a 10% reserve.
If your depositor tries to withdraw more than 1 BTC, you're screwed, but that's fractional reserve banking for you.

@_date: 2013-05-22 08:06:11
Just have to correct you here. This is a common misconception that I have made as well. The argument that deflating prices are bad stems not from smartphones depreciating in value, i.e.
Year | Good | Price | Price | Price
:-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-:
2012 | iPhone 5 | 599 | | 
2013 | iPhone 5 | 399 | |
 | iPhone 6 | | 599 |
2014 | iPhone 5 | 199 | |
 | iPhone 6 | | 399 |
 | iPhone 7 | | | 599
No one is arguing that consumers will STILL have to consume to survive and that goods today will hold lesser value in the future (normal good). The argument being made is as follows:
Because money is capped, newer and better goods are cheaper relative to their older counterparts:
Year | Good | Price | Price | Price
:-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-:
2012 | iPhone 5 | 599 | | 
2013 | iPhone 5 | 299 | |
 | iPhone 6 | | 399 |
2014 | iPhone 5 | 49 | |
 | iPhone 6 | | 99 |
 | iPhone 7 | | | 199
This is just an example of the deflation that (keynesian) economist say will bad when prices deflate. Not that older goods lose value over time. In the second table, most people will wait to spend their money because why buy the iPhone 5 for 599 today when the iPhone 7 brand new would cost 199? Saving up the 599 that you are going to spend today means you can buy 3 new iPhone 7's at release. People spend less -&gt; knowing that, businesses innovate less, because why spend the R&amp;D today if the price of your newer good is going to sell for relatively cheaper than your old product? Overall welfare will be lower.
P.s. prices are chosen arbitrarily to reflect deflation in prices of newer goods in the second table and to reflect the reduction of value of the same good in the future in the first table.
Hope I get a well thought out reply that can rid me of this thinking.

Your argument here was gold is old and is good. Bitcoin is new and unknown and therefore bad. I did not say you referred to everything. But you ARE saying that Gold has ALWAYS been known for its value and therefore is a good thing.
Also what is old? 1000 years? 100 years? And what is new? 10 years? 100 years?

I have to state again that: deflation/inflation rates selected are arbitrary and used merely to show the difference. Suppose we say 4% deflation rate is not a "bad" thing, only hyperdeflation (or hyperinflation) is "bad", then inversely, inflation of 4% is not a "bad" thing.
Consider this, if I had an iPhone 4 bought in 2011, then yes, I would wait. If a sufficient number of people wait, then Apple does not get the money for R&amp;D to innovate. If however everyone buys the iPhone 5, then Apple holding on to that revenue allows Apple to "consume" more in 2013 than if they sold their iPhone 7 for a lower price. I'll be back with a more formal argument of that. 
Appreciate the replies. :)

So if 3. happens, the sellers loses $200 (1 BTC lost ($100) + $100) and the buyer loses $100 ($200 - 1BTC gained ($100))? Doesn't this mean the seller is at a losing position?

You are right, the real values may. Though any real positive value at time T will hold for time t=0 irregardless of the nominal value, wouldn't you say so? If I invested 10 (Y) at t=0 and get 8 (P2) at t=T and at t=T, 8 buys me 8 goods, wouldn't that 10, I spent at t=0, if saved and spent at t=T buy me 8 goods + more?

I agree that if btc becomes the unit of account, there will be stability. An apple today at 1BTC would likely be 1BTC tomorrow. However in 5 years it will likely be less than 1BTC due to competing for the same bitcoin pie. I am talking in a theoretical sense. 21 million unit cap on the unit of account. More goods and services competing for that same pie (over an infinite continuous period) thus prices of those goods and services become deflationary. No?
If you were the widget maker, savings would be bad for you as people no longer buy your widget now and defer their buying. Economists are always concerned about the margin.
A significantly more productive investment (producing either goods or services), due to lead times will also have to sell their output at lower prices. Theoretically speaking due to the point I made in this first paragraph.
Thanks for that sub. :)
