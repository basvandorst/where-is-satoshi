Your response demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding across a few topics: 
1) The difference between money and currency. 
2) What Bitcoin actually is.  
3) How technology is adopted. 
You are also trying to prove your uneducated point by taking an *extremely* short term view on things. What bitcoin is worth tomorrow in USD is neither here nor there. 
I could go into all of this with you, but considering you posted this only to try and spite, troll, and ridicule a community of people (which is not very Christian of you, I might add) I am not going to bother. I find it to be in extremely poor taste. 
You aren't here to learn, so I'm not going to bother teaching you.

If you're thinking about investing, do so with a long term trajectory (as in hodling for the next 10 years) and start religiously dollar cost averaging each investment. 
It's a good way to keep sane and saves you mentally from a lot of the trials and tribulations being a new investor in crypto brings. 
Don't get too emotionally attached. Both bull markets and bear markets come and go. Bitcoin has managed to survive them all so far.

Early investors always get the most benefits in basically everything. This phenomenon isn't exclusive to crypto in the slightest. 
[Read what a pyramid scheme actually is.]( 
Bitcoin is first and foremost a technology that provides use (that just so happens to also provide value). Making money is a bonus.

LN is amazing and I cannot wait for it to be fully adopted. 
But anyone who thinks it will happen seamlessly is very naive. LN adoption will come with its own bumps in the road.

I'm guessing we're bearish for most of the year. I expect us to find our price floor below 5k, but maybe I'm just being optimistic. 
I'm a short term bear, long term bull. 
I'd say we're just about due for another bear market. Historically one always follows after a "bubble". Too many weak hands and even more weak alts that need a good shaking out. 
Before anyone gets on my ass or down votes me to oblivion - bear markets are good for Bitcoin. They still bring grown and innovation. Plus, we straight up aren't ready to take over the world yet. 
On top of all that, I'm greedy. I'll take as much time as I can get to buy up as many cheap coins as possible. We aren't going to see buying opportunities like this ever again in our lifetimes (re: 2014 bear market + every other bear market in BTC's history).

In bitcoin’s 9 years of history a giant crash followed by a downward trend has never been an indication of the death of bitcoin - no matter how many times people proclaim it. 
And there have been *numerous* giant crashes followed by downward trends. 
If something better has arrived I highly doubt it’ll overtake bitcoin in a ~year or less. These things take a lot of time to grow and develop. 
Keep some perspective in mind when the impending crash and downward trend is finally upon us. The next bear market could take years, just like the last one. However having faith, patience, and holding has *never*, not once, been a bad play to make.

My first buy was during the bull trap of the 2013 bubble. I felt like a genius for a good two days before having to face the reality that was literally crashing down around me. 
Thankfully I had the foresight to keep buying when we chilled at 200 for forever and a day, but that was at a time in my life when I was working in fast food and still a student so I didn’t have much spare money to put towards it. 
Forever wishing I were living in today’s circumstances during the last bear market! 
But I’m trying to keep perspective. The next bear  market will find its floor and we’ll probably never see prices that cheap again in our lifetimes, just like with the last bear market and each bear market before that. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:49:08
Actually, I believe the crashes and bear markets strengthen bitcoin (and cryptocurrency in general) as a whole. Even in the short term I don’t think it’ll actually hurt anything (except for the weak hands and their weak feelings.). 
Bull markets are easy. They’re happy, positive, and exciting. Nothing about then is too scary. Bull markets are great because they bring in waves of new eyes and new money. That is what they’re best at. 
Bear markets is where the market actually grows and strengthens. After all the weak hands are shaken out there is always a substantial chunk of people who actually internalize what it means to “hodl”. Yeah, bear markets shake out the weak hands, but they also reveal the new, strong ones. 


Their wells will only be poisoned until the next bull market in which case they can either: 
a) Remain bitter fools and stubbornly ignore a shiny new technology that’s going to change the world (their loss). 
Or 
b) Admit that they were wrong and jump back on the hype train a stronger hand than ever. 
Either way I’m not worried or concerned with them. 
As for finding our price floor in the hundreds. I’m not optimistic that that’ll happen. Those sorts of prices are just so incredibly cheap and we’ve spent so long above 1k that I don’t think the space will mentally be able to justify prices below it. 
I imagine we dip below 1k for a very brief period of time, but I think we’ll find our floor somewhere in between 1k - 3k (leaning closer to 1k).

Exactly this. Sure it's exciting to watch the price go up, but compared to where we could be in 10-20 years this is chump change. Drops don't bother me. 
There could very well come a day where we never see coins this cheap ever again. People lack so much foresight. 
@_date: 2017-01-07 17:27:32
Not OP, but post bubble I think the lowest we drop will be the $500-$800 range USD. Pretty sure seeing coins going for less than $400 are a thing of the past. 
Who knows though. It's impossible to tell at this stage. At the end of the day btc will do what btc does. (I.e.  Give you whiplash)

Did they recently change CEO's or something? 
Strange to me that an app who at first is only for buying/selling/sending/receiving Bitcoin would be so against it. 
The app is so clean and easy to use. I've always pushed using Circle when I had friends interested in getting into btc, especially if they were Apple users.

No it won't, which is the entire point of a soft fork. 
By definition, soft forks are *always* backwards compatible. 
Which is what makes them different than a hard fork.

Yes, it is going to be super easy to use - even by non-technical standards. 
Zapp tweeted a bit ago a demo of their UI and it is seamless and easy. People who are saying that LN is going to be too hard for "normal" people to use forget the innovative spirit of humanity as well as general design techniques that have been used and studied for decades now. 
End game, no one is going to know how Bitcoin or LN work. But they will use them. 
Just in the same way no one (as in "normal", non technical people) understands how their cars work or the internet itself works. They don't care, as long as it does work and it's easy to learn how to use. 
@_date: 2018-02-19 14:16:18
You need to use a LN compatible wallet and manually move funds over to the LN. 
It'll be similar to how your bank account works. You move money over from savings to checking and vice versa

Private key -&gt; public key -&gt; address 
The public key is generated from the private key. 
The address is a hash of the public key.

LN will definitely increase transaction pressure, but I imagine the pressure ends up being fairly gradual similar to segwit adoption. 
There are going to be people excited to use it, but it will take businesses a while before adoption starts setting in dramatically. 
Just as with slow segwit adoption, a slow adoption of LN would be a good thing for everyone involved. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 14:29:18
It gets complicated quickly, but to put it simply: instead of seeing specific public keys associated with an address, the old nodes see a bit of data that essentially boils down to "anyone can spend these coins" from this address. 
This doesn't actually mean that literally anyone can spend those coins from that address. This is because we have new nodes that are able to adequately process segwit data and keep things secure. 
But for backwards compatibility purposes, this is the way old nodes process segwit data.

I actually am a woman (surprise) who works in a very male dominant area (carpentry/painting/general home improvement labor) and I very much do my part to encourage other ladies to take up trades - as well as getting involved with crypto.
Stepping into a field that's male dominant is not easy, especially when you regularly hear comments like the one above. I don't care if it's a joke or not, it makes the whole community look bad and only works to exclude a large portion of society.

Segwit is essentially a blocksize increase. (Plus some other good things like fixing transaction malleability - which in turn allows for other awesome tech like LN to be used.)
Segwit stands for Segregated Witness 
Meaning in any given block the witness data of a transaction has been segregated. It's all still there, but it's been organized in a way for more efficient transactions in general. 
This allows for bigger blocks to occur. Now this data is weighted differently than blocks pre-segwit. Each block can only hold so much weight, and segwit allows the data to be "lighter" - meaning we can now fit more. 
If all transactions on the blockchain were segwit transactions we could potentially have blocks as big as 4MB (or just about). 
This will lower transaction fees as well as speed up transaction throughout. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 08:34:36
End game, we will be able to make transactions on LN through a series of "hops". This is when our transaction jumps from node to node until it gets to where it needs to be. 
Running a node is the same as having an open and active LN channel. Meaning if you have an open channel then you will simultaneously be running a node. The cost of running one will basically be non-existent from the user's perspective. 
When you are running a node you will be able to set your own fee for being used as a connecting point so transactions can hop through you. Because the cost of running a node is so minute, there won't be a point to trying to recoup costs through high fees. So there will only be potential profits on the horizon. 
Meaning, as most competitive markets work, you'll want to minimize your fee in order to gather more. If you set your fee too high, no one will use you to hop their transactions through because there will always be a cheaper option available. 
As small fries, I don't think it matters much to us what our individual node fees are because we probably won't be facilitating many hops. Where the fees really come into play is with "hubs" which are well funded and very well connected nodes. 
They could potentially be processing millions of transactions a second. If they offer cheap fees to do so, they will gain popularity as a hub. As I mentioned, it will be a competitive market and the fees will reflect that. Fees will probably only be a few cents to begin with, but will probably get down to fractions of a cent once LN gains more popularity and hubs get more and more competitive.

Adopt a long term perspective. 
The gains we've seen the past year have been amazing, but this is nothing compared to where we'll be in 10 years. 
Dollar cost average your investment. Buy a little more every two weeks no matter what the price is. Stop looking at the price entirely. 
Look at your BTC holdings in terms of total BTC and not their USD value.

Mining for actual BTC will lose profitability *long* before the full 21 million have been mined. 
Miners will be incentivize to continue for transaction fees. Moving to a fee based system is inevitable and will work just fine, as proven by the data gathered in 2017.

There are tons of ladies in bitcoin/crypto if you bother to look. Obviously not as many ladies as there are dudes, but we exist. 
On Reddit, it's usually not relevant to the conversation for a woman to admit that she's a woman, but I would guess there are a lot more ladies lurking around here than you'd expect. However, I've found that crypto twitter has the biggest outward female presence.
