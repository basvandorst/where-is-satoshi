While I am sure this Atlas kid is a right asshole, for example, Huffington actually did almost the exact same thing to Huffpo. Where was the outrage there? 
I am convinced people are so used to be exploited for money that nothing really outrages them anymore and its a big shame.

I think you are the one who doesn't understand economics, I am sorry to say. There is a big political component to currency economics. This past decade (not in the next future decades) the push to move off the dollar base has already started. For example, BRIC countries have already moved off the dollar for their currency of trade. [news on that](
If you believe the dollar will remain the sole base currency, "for a few more decades" you are deluded. As its use as a base is continually diminished, its value will continue to sink.
The dollar doesn't have a "few decades" it has *maybe* 1 decade. This is what Americans don't get. Their stupidity in blind adherence to their ideologues and total inaction in the face of everything they once stood for being stripped away in a massive corporatist runaway, is based on a very deluded assumption. That we are " and will remain so and its an issue "for the future" or "in a few decades". Er, no. Loss of AAA+ rating does have meaning, its big and real.
Edit: Oh and the mid east and BRICS have moved off the dollar for oil [news on that](

A month! Man, we should get together and figure out how to fix this. Are there more like us? If we can get everyone who is being robbed like this, we should be able to gather enough money and brain power to figure out a way. I have money to spend on something like this.

I sent the email as instructed. While I appreciate your reply here, I must point out:
1) If the online services of my bank, broker, factor, accountant, etc are going to be inaccessible they give me prior warning. Then I always have the ability to withdraw my funds from a branch. 
2) For me, if someone holds my money and refuses to give it back to me for no reason, it is theft. It is not the appearance of theft. 
3) I don't know how many big accounts you hold, but I am sure you didn't steal from them. There is a simple reason for that, you believe that small account holders do not have the urgent motive to make you pay. I, on the other hand, cannot allow myself to be robbed. Its a personal issue but one that is important to me. It will take time, and then I will need to recoup all expenses from you. It will not be enjoyable, but you had to realize you would steal from at least a few people who would do anything to bite back when you decided to walk this path.

$50 for a transfer? I think not :(.
@_date: 2011-10-02 21:43:45
No its not the money, its the disrespect. This is not my toaster or some random consumer good we are talking about, this person is trying to steal money from me. For that I am willing to spend a bit, though I am not interested in buying a car, if you know what I mean. If you hear anything that can be useful, we have a procedure here called an introduction fee. I'd be more than willing to pay that to you for successful completion.

Rule 10, I believe?
@_date: 2011-10-02 21:28:35
If you have any info on how I might go about that, I'd appreciate a PM.
Edit: I am not kidding, either. Working around the law in this way is standard where I live. It would only boil down to cost and how certain I would be that my money will get results.

Is there no way to take legal action? I actually know someone who is working in Japan for Mitsubishi, and he might be willing to do some footwork. 
Edit: I cannot believe this kind of theft cannot be remedied. I have money and am willing to give it to a Japanese law enforcement or lawyer or even yakuza to make this right.

I've changed my dwollar password about 6 times since mt gox put their head up their ass and blew bubbles. So I didn't need to click the link, but I don't think there are any redditors who would click the link anyway. That kind of phishing only works on our parents. :)
@_date: 2011-10-02 20:59:26
That is clearly no question. I would obviously not be using Gox again. However, all my bitcoins are being held hostage. 
 
As I said in my reply, all I have done is loose money. I am just bitcoin dabbler/supporter. I like it, think its a great idea, but also do not have the time to pay attention to it. I am not selling, just buying so I can then use it to buy things and support the idea of it.

The 'run away with the money' plan ran up against real world law enforcement and a new plan was needed.

I don't know anything about any of the pyramid scheme thing (but would love to know if its true), but the rest is my issue. I cannot withdraw.

I'm not normally an IRC user, I will have to figure it out. Is there a difference in response from emails and IRC?
@_date: 2011-10-02 21:14:00
Ouch. However, its like that where I live too. Here, I would just pay a police chief I know to make a visit to his home. Is there anything like that in Japan?

If you have time and can start collecting ways to contact them (this also goes to any others out there who are lurking), thanks to Calimhero's advice, I have setup an appointment with someone who may be able to start the ball rolling later this week. You should let them know that I plan to recoup *all* expenses made in this project, not just what was stolen but everything we spend on collecting. I'll be honest, I will also take a service fee percentage but it will come from the thief.
To be clear, I am Filipino and our laws are much more flexible when it comes to this kind of thing. So if they have any ethical constraints, or are afraid of anything but minor prosecution where they live, they should not join. Also, these things take time when working internationally. I've only had to collect from a thief in Singapore and one in China before, so I have no clue what time frame with Japan will be like. Both those times it took months to get satisfaction (with China it was almost a year but most of that was spent trying to find them and then sell their assets to get the cash that was owed). So this is not an immediate result, but this is not only about the money but the disrespect and, frankly, punishment. I will expect whoever we contract to show us some initial progress before we pay anything. I will have more money to throw at this the more people we can gather (my service fee will be larger and I can invest more).
