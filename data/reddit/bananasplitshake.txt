Why? What's the upside?
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:35:30
Oh man. That's rough. :(

FYI. I just now set up a wallet on Electrum and transferred all of my BTC out of coinbase and was successful.  I downloaded the wallet at 12:10am Central and funds were transferred by 12:35am.
If you haven't taken steps yet to get out of Coinbase, it's not too late.

If you want the potential upside of BCC currency, you need to transfer out of Coinbase.  I just did it and transferred to an Electrum wallet.

Meh. Or its success could bolster confidence in digital currency causing BTC to rise further.

My guess is we are the beginning of the correction. 
But what do I know?  Maybe it will double in the next two weeks. Maybe it will multiple ten fold in the next year. If that's your approach...

This is on the electrum site:
"How to redeem my BCC?
BCC wallets will require you to import your seed or your private keys, which can be exported from Electrum. Doing so will expose all your Bitcoin funds associated with that seed to the BCC wallet you decide to use. 
Therefore, after the BCC fork, but before you enter a seed or private key in a BCC wallet, you should move all your funds to a new Electrum wallet, with a new seed. You will still be able to use the old seed or private key with BCC, because BCC has replay protection. Wait until your funds are confirmed in your new Bitcoin wallet, before you enter the old private key in a BCC wallet. This will protect your BTC funds from rogue/untrusted software."

Many people are saying a correction is either here now or right around the corner. Doubling in a month is hard to sustain. I cashed out last night but only time will tell if that was correct.

This is on the electrum site but also is relevant to your situation:

My understanding is that as long as you have the key, you're fine. 
You only have BTC with the key at the moment, but with the key you can get both BTC and BCC at a future date through an exchange.
That's my relatively novice understanding of the situation.

I cashed out my tiny stash at 4400 last night. The correction seemed inevitable. So far that move looks to be paying off.

My understanding is that as long as you have the key, you're fine. So no you don't need electrum. I was just copy/pasting for simplicity since it's relevant.
