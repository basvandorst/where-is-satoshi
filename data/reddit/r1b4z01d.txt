Not nearly that quantity but I know the feeling. We live and we learn. Good news is it's still very early considering.

I use my miner as my gaming/media center pc. When I'm not gaming or watching tv on the projector it's mining.

Watercooling helps so much. I can OC my 5850s and have them running at idle temps. 
@_date: 2011-08-31 14:16:07
Well what is your setup?

I think I just convinced my parents to invest. ;) I have been talking about it for years and I text my Stepfather a pic of the price every week. This week he took the bite.

Drugs do but so does sex, sugar, tv , you name it. People ruin their own lives; some use drugs to do it. I do know that arresting someone for a health problem is not the answer. Making someone a criminal ruins there life far more then some of these drugs will ever do.

In all honesty, if you read the information available he took the hit out on the guy (that probably never even happened) to protect the users of SR. The guy was extorting money from him by threatening to release users name, addresses and more. Was DPR looking out for himself yes but his primary goal was to keep the customers safe. I don't think the guy deserved to have a hit out on him but don't try and extort hundreds of thousands of dollars and not expect some repercussions. Am I totally off base by thinking this way?

"MT gox it think it is" get someone that really knows what the hell they are talking about.
