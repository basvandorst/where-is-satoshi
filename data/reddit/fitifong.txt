That's actually a pretty good analogy for the context
@_date: 2014-02-08 02:15:33
I didn't think our eyes were real though?
@_date: 2014-09-28 00:02:20
would not be happy at all with this post.

is literally the most figurative person I've ever seen
@_date: 2014-01-29 22:06:00
You're wrong. I expect it to reach a good 140,000, then go down by about 20,000 (just a correction) and then it's to the moon for this subreddit.
I'm thinking in the end we'll cap at about 700,000,000 subscribers.

This fucker's been everywhere

The fact that it's backed by a meme makes it have that much more potential for growth, because memes are naturally popular. And I don't mean that in any bad way.
@_date: 2017-02-27 21:01:54
You're exactly right. Every public issue by law must come with a prospectus. In the case of an ETF, I'm not sure what the specifics are, but the idea is to ensure that investors can be made exactly aware of what they're investing in. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 04:50:57
Yes I completely understand that whole concept about memes, and how they quickly end followed by the quick adoption of another. My point was misunderstood, I didn't mean dogecoin has more potential for long-term growth than bitcoin because it's back by a meme. I mostly meant that it has more potential **popularity** growth to get more people aware of crypto-currencies in general, then eventually be introduced to bitcoin. 
If we want bitcoin to gain more awareness that will eventually lead to mass adoption, we need better way to communicate this idea to the masses, and dogecoin is basically the answer, since it's backed by something that's good at attracting attention.
I'm really sorry if I'm causing some confusion, I'm a bit intoxicated and I shouldn't be spending so much time on reddit while I am.

I'm waiting for the same thing. I think it'll fall by tomorrow afternoon.

But if you leave your online bank account open, that's all fine and dandy, right?
@_date: 2013-11-26 23:00:55
You have to remember that just like the internet, Bitcoin will improve over time from the addition of different services and features.
If it actually catches on, Bitcoin will be a lot more different in 100 years than it is today. There will most likely be safeguards for things such as people dying/theft/loss/fire, etc.
@_date: 2013-11-20 05:16:52
Just replace the 'ThisIsYourWithdrawBitcoinAddress' with your address.
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:12:23
Well of course banks are safer right now, they've been around for centuries, bitcoin is ~~two~~ five years old, adequate security systems haven't been put in place yet because it's still in its infancy.
The anchorman in the video simply said that if you leave your bitcoin account open, people would steal from it. My comment was another way of saying "no fucking shit". 
Sorry about the confusion.

The site's very new, so it's hard to find reviews. It looks like just a case of very slow shipping. The people who said it was a scam were most likely unaware of this and forgot to change their review when they finally got the order.
I hope you get your PS4!
EDIT: Hmm, it looks like the only reviewer who changed his mind said it in a guest account (Aaron). This could mean that the company tried to cover up.
@_date: 2013-11-30 04:51:42
Almost seems like they cut out the bad parts of some of the interviews, but nonetheless it was still pretty informative.
@_date: 2013-11-27 03:15:09
I think the reason why bitcoin gained so much popularity so quickly is because of the 2008 financial crisis. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 00:09:46
Obviously he tipped 1,000BTC and 550BTC to two accounts that originally had .0001337.
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:39:50
It's really weird to think that if this all works out to be as big and successful as the internet itself, we're the ones that are making history. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 19:59:51
I was thinking the same thing
@_date: 2013-11-30 02:19:01
I prefer shitcoin, thankyouverymuch

aaaannd now it's worth $160m

If you *really* want to watch it live, watch it here: Bitcoinicity has a bit of a delay, and clarkmoody shows transactions in realtime.
@_date: 2013-11-26 19:54:02
quickbt.com, although these are small transactions with daily limits.
@_date: 2013-11-27 00:54:46
I have no idea why I typed two years, I meant four, which is still wrong, but bitcoin gained popularity by around 2009, so I would have based it on that. My bad.
@_date: 2013-11-21 05:53:59
$0.59 here
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:25:25
I agree with your two last points, but the first point could apply to bitcoins too, because any wallet can add a timeout feature
@_date: 2013-11-27 03:02:41
As well as "The Protesters" in 2011
@_date: 2013-11-26 01:49:42
2013 should, and will be Snowden's year

Very well put together. Good job!
