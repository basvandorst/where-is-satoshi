Early participants who took *what* risks, exactly? Running experimental software while AFK?
Just call it what it is: extreme good fortune or foresightedness to be in on the ground floor.
Edit: don't anyone think I'm calling Bitcoin's currency distribution method *unfair*. They made the rules, made them universal, and played by them. I just think their riches are the result of luck or brains, which are two sides of a coin that depends on how events turned out.

MtRed is only irregular until more people join it. I wonder if people prefer steady payouts as opposed to zero fees.
@_date: 2011-06-07 21:37:55
The no-transaction-fees thing works best peer-to-peer. Mt Gox is infrastructure - it needs funding, and beyond that, its owners will probably charge what the market will bear.
Also a small charge per trade prevents high-volume trading algorithms from engaging in meaningless arbitrage.
@_date: 2011-06-14 21:48:49
For Bitcoin to take off, even a dummy needs to be able to secure their wallet. This probably won't be a popular suggestion, but I think trustworthy, regulated banks with deposit guarantees are going to be required.  The bank needs to be incorporated somewhere and subject to sovereign laws regarding misuse of deposits. People should only be storing cash-at-hand on their local machines or in exchanges.
@_date: 2011-06-18 07:11:21
So wow, looks like Magical Tux owes people some money.
Edit: in fact, I think the Bitcoin community ought to move its deposits out of MtGox until it makes this right.

It's worse than that, because some will mine even when it's unprofitable (because they don't connect mining and electricity), because they think coin value will shoot up, or because their energy is 'free'.

Your username contains 'speculating', so let me just advise this: don't rely on speculation returns to pay off your loans. A volatile market will eat your investment, leaving you with pennies on the dollar and a huge liability.

I don't want anyone to think I'm judging Bitcoin here. But I think this is a reality its users have to confront: it will be used anonymously by criminals and thus it will attract negative attention - possibly even legal sanctions.

That's a good point. If you're going to end up with 50 BTC through mining, why not earn it bit by bit instead of shooting for all at once?
@_date: 2011-06-10 07:52:26


No! Nothing wrong with any of it, as I've already said.
But *risk*? It's not like somebody mortgaging their house to pay their startup's developers. I wish the early adopters would just say, "Yes, we got in first, and we're making out like bandits. Ha! What a windfall!" instead of trying to make it look like they took a risk downloading and running some software (which is how the vast majority of Bitcoin millionaires came into their fortunes).
@_date: 2011-06-20 23:05:14


That's all you can do. I've decided there's no point forming an opinion on what's happening over at Mt Gox, since it's basically [*Rashomon*]( at this point. And there's certainly no point getting into an internet argument over it.
@_date: 2011-06-11 11:35:56
Nobody is a retard or a genius until history vindicates them. I mean, if you sold at 30 the other day, people would have called you a fool. With 24 hours' hindsight, people can call you a genius for liquidating at the top of the market, then increasing your holdings by 50% at the bottom. In another day, people might paste you again because the price is at $10.

The two aren't mutually exclusive. You can use bitcoin for bankless transfers, but as this guy's loss shows, securing a reserve of digital currency is probably a job for a specialist.
@_date: 2011-06-18 10:40:12
I said move, not liquidate. Any banked coins can be transferred to another exchange without moving the market.
@_date: 2011-06-15 23:55:52
No. That's what checks and balances are for.
@_date: 2011-06-12 01:03:27
Yes, because what merchants want to support is a currency which may swing 30% overnight. I think Bitcoin, as a brand, is damaged for the next six months at least.

When the alternative is that a single person stored 1/12 of the bitcoins in existence in Mt Gox... that theory begins to look credible.

Look, in a share house the resource usage is never going to be perfectly even. Someone will have longer showers, someone will use more of the internet, someone's food will take over the fridge. 
But your housemates are subsidising your income, and they don't really have a chance to dispute it with you. The awesome thing to do would be to spend some of your bitcoins on communal things, or even to split the earnings and convert some more people to BTC.

It's a flippant term, I'm not entirely serious. But its utility as a currency is being held back by its exposure to rampant speculation.
