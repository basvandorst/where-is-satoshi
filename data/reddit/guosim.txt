Nice! I'm making a similar site.
@_date: 2015-06-02 08:52:42
I'm not planning on doing it to spam the network, I just want to see how fast the network can process these transactions. I understand that it's desirable to create as few transactions as possible and pay a fee, but I don't want to include a fee because the transactions I'm sending are so small that a fee of 10 bits is significant, and I have to create so many transactions because I'm sending the transactions to different addresses (unless it's possible to send to send bitcoin to multiple addresses in one transaction?)
For my purposes, I don't care about priority. It's fine if takes up to a week or a month to process.

Thank you.

Thanks, I didn't know how bitcoin days were calculated.
I don't really care about sending the bitcoins in the next block or fast at all, just maybe sometime in the next week or month.
Without bitcoin days, would I be unable to send transactions for free?
@_date: 2015-06-02 10:55:58
well shit.

If the experiment fails, lots of money and resources will exit Bitcoin. I don't think waiting for Moore's law to catch up (if it ever does) is a valid argument, especially since Moore's prediction is nearing its end.

I'm wondering about this as well. Is Electrum a secure brain wallet?
@_date: 2014-06-23 22:37:14
Sad to see Just Dice close. Seems like the golden age of cryptocurrency gambling is coming to an end.

If all eighteen of your wallets were compromised at the same time, and you are certain that neither your PC nor your offline backups were compromised, then doesn't that mean this person most likely has compromised way more than eighteen wallets? Seems like he found out a way to crack most, if not all, of the wallets generated using brainwallet's random button. If that's the case, why aren't there more posts like this?
@_date: 2014-06-23 07:17:32
Huh, this is interesting stuff. Reminds me of an episode of Ghost in the Shell called Full Auto Capitalism.
@_date: 2014-06-26 20:48:02
Thank you!
@_date: 2014-06-16 22:24:59
Not sure what this is all about, but can't hurt to try!
@_date: 2014-07-22 21:10:50
Stupidity is not something bitcoin can solve.
@_date: 2014-06-24 20:02:14
Didn't this happen quite a while ago? I thought California always supported Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-12-25 05:35:11
Merry Christmas to you too!
@_date: 2014-06-10 00:02:20
Good luck! Looking to do something similar.
@_date: 2014-06-10 02:56:16
Thanks for the encouragement! Thing is, I know I don't have the technical skills yet. Plus, I don't even know what to do! I just want to spread awareness of Bitcoin in my general area.
@_date: 2014-08-15 22:26:19
what happened?
@_date: 2014-06-20 21:29:54
If he bought out every single bitcoin on the market at that time, wouldn't Bitcoin grow a lot slower?
@_date: 2014-06-29 08:22:40
@_date: 2015-05-24 14:10:23
It could be. I hope they get competition.
@_date: 2015-05-20 13:01:55
Pm me when it's on github please!
@_date: 2015-05-16 14:04:19
What's the point of banning cash? Is that really what the article is saying?
@_date: 2015-05-20 16:31:20
whoop dee doo
@_date: 2015-05-17 00:00:42
Thanks. That makes sense.
@_date: 2015-05-29 15:03:48
Good luck.
@_date: 2015-05-21 17:42:42
wow, great progress

Thanks, but what's this for?
@_date: 2015-05-30 17:43:59
two wrongs don't make a right
@_date: 2015-05-24 14:16:38
Oh really? How are they sustaining themselves?
@_date: 2015-05-23 14:52:18
This is nice. Thanks Chandler. I'll try to join in the fun!
@_date: 2015-05-15 09:52:12
Impressive speech.
@_date: 2015-05-23 15:42:33
ah, right
@_date: 2015-05-13 12:05:19
Thanks a lot Rassah. I've been looking at different ways of accepting bitcoin for a while now but this looks like exactly what I need.
@_date: 2015-05-24 14:25:22
I see. Well, I hope they become big too.
@_date: 2016-11-08 03:53:08
@_date: 2015-07-01 17:51:02
Bitcoin is not inherently private, but can be made anonymous with tools. However, what if a government simply makes it illegal to accept bitcoin that can't be traced?
@_date: 2015-04-30 19:45:03
How is he not arrested yet?
@_date: 2015-04-28 22:26:50
Thanks for the list of charities! I'm making a lil something that will make use of it.
@_date: 2015-04-27 01:47:14
Do you think this is an effective way to spread adoption?
@_date: 2016-05-02 07:29:08
well then
@_date: 2016-05-02 07:45:52
Refuses to sign anything else with any other key. 
Why would he do that if he's trying to prove he's Satoshi?
