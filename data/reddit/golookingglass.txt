Twitter is a time saver when I think I'm spending too much time here on reddit.

Maybe I misunderstand you, but it's the distributed nature of the system that you trust.  Either bitcoin works for all of us, or for none. As long as it does work they are getting fees plus the miner reward. The miners are not going to game the system unless they can win. They can lose it all - all of them. As long as the honest miners are in charge the blockchain will recover from any error. That would be the main consideration, are you prepared to wait.

Was not attempting to rebut or dispute, was attempting to inform that bitcoin is in the public domain. What others intend to do with "their coin" is up to "their" developers. You are free to critique, but not to claim ownership - no stealing, no fake, no ripoff. And that applies to all sides, not just to any one party claiming that it's "their" bitcoin, and theirs alone. 
Basically, it's a legal concept - no one can steal from you what doesn't belong to you. That's what freedom means. Rain is free, bottled water isn't, because it's generally licenced, and the source of it belongs to someone. Satoshi gave us something more free, and more valuable, that bottled money, and he did that by remaining anonymous. That's what bitcoin is mostly about today, whose bottled money is better. Hope this helps.

If we are talking about an attack, why not the entire network. Even to attack one person they need to overpower the network otherwise the attack is ephemeral, it will be fixed. I don't understand how the attack will succeed unless the chain is already highly vulnerable. Are we talking about bitcoin now, 2017 going on 2018, this is a very robust network?

You do realize they have a 1GB test net? They may not have many nodes but apparently it does cover the globe and I believe that at least one university is involved. Sorry cannot give you a link you could google it. My interest is less in Bitcoin itself than in what Satoshi's White Paper has unleashed on the world. Just an amateur Futurist here. 
"... future-oriented individuals educated in every academic discipline, including... computer science, economics... history, management, mathematics, philosophy... and other disciplines."
Suggestion: Lookup 'British East India Company" in Wikipedia. World history is very relevant to understanding possible future scenarios. Just human nature. "Dark ages" come and go and social media isn't guaranteed to make a more informed world. "Flat Earth" societies and their ilk are already here.

Satoshi is fallible when bitcoins fails, when it has so little value that the miners have abandoned it. Until then, what would you say he is? I know Bitcoin has changed since Satoshi left, but consider what he accomplished. In what way was he fallible. How has Bitcoin failed, and can he be held accountable? And for what exactly?
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:58:56
People here are underestimating the decentralized nature of Bcash development. Roger, et.al may have got Bcash started, but there is a roadmap and multiple developer groups. To quote CoinTelegraph: 
"Wright’s confidence in the altcoin appears to be based on the major changes scheduled to be implemented on the Bitcoin Cash platform, including the introduction of a non-constrained block size.With these developments, it will be interesting to see whether Bitcoin Cash will be able to compete against the number one digital currency competitively"

I presume SPVs can be made more secure, what about full nodes. Do they need upgrading or are they OK?
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:20:35
I think there is going to be a cap initially until it's safe to use larger amounts. Micro transactions first, then scale it up. How long before LN is the main network for daily transactions? I doubt anyone knows yet. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:14:40
Could you elaborate. What exactly makes it self-sustaining. I don't disagree with you, just trying to understand. Do you mean the maths, game theory, economics, or all of the above when you say "not dependent on the human actors". Design rather that the code that necessarily follows the design if it is to be trusted. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:43:36
I second your observations. My quibble with the author is about hard vs soft forks. Code is code whether it's a hard or soft fork. The only way to protect against any bugs in soft-forked code is to NOT upgrade until you have no choice. This likely applies to segwit adoption by wallets, exchanges, etc. Someone still has to go first. Hard forks have their own logistical problems, in getting everybody to upgrade. Scheduled, regular upgrades would be one answer, you would get used to them. Blackberry did infrequent updates but you knew they were coming. Google does updates far too often, but they do them fairly well. I usually wait for them to tell me to upgrade, otherwise I ignore them.

"The Judgment of Solomon is a story from the Hebrew Bible in which King Solomon of Israel ruled between two women both claiming to be the mother of a child."
Sorry, but bitcoin is effectively in the public domain. You can blame Satoshi and the white paper for the current state of affairs - he bequeathed it to everyone, not just one group. It may not be covered by any particular open source licence - there is more than one kind - but at this point it makes little difference. It's not yours, it's everyone's baby. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:47:56
OK. I get your point about high net worth people. Where you thinking of Satoshi's coins. I could see that being attempted. Not sure about the payoff though. Aren't those coins being watched?
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:29:19
It's up to the honest miners to sort that out, or else they FAIL I don't think it would be impossible to counteract what "hacker miners" can do with "bot nets". Bitcoin is mostly being mined with ASCI machines and a successfull attack would need very wealth backers. Defending against chain splits, etc., is rather trivial because the economic incentives have actually worked to keep the network safe.
Satoshi only had to be a genius not a God and the miners to behave as predicted - greedy not stupid. Do bitcoin's current developers understand Satoshi's design? Bitcoin is not just code, it is economics, maths, cryptography, game theory, etc. The generals are in charge, not the bitcoin warriors. Have you read or heard of "The Art of War" by Sun Tzu, Chinese military treatise, 5th Century BC.
Wikipedia: "The Art of War remains the most influential strategy text in East Asia. It has [had] a profound influence on Eastern and Western military thinking, business tactics, legal strategy and beyond."

I think he is just explaining how Bitcoin currently works and as far as I know it hasn't yet been changed. When it is changed then no, you can say he is not. Until then, he effectively is.
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:34:26
The one thing that I don't get is how do the full nodes coordinate with the honest miners. Don't the miners have these high-speed networks that they use to coordinate among themselves. They don't want to waste their time mining orphan blocks. Does it have anything to do miners having to rebuild a chain if it is tampered with. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:22:04
Sounds sensible. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:01:31
Would that be more like how Google handles updates. Occasionally they have told me that the version that I am running is no longer supported or something to that effect. That would be like a hard fork the ones I ignore are like a soft fork.?
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:21:07
Probably depends on the context. Was looking at other Level-2 type approaches to try and understand how they work and came across "IOU" as part of the definition. A lot of conflation going on when there are over a 1000 so-called cryptocurrencies though I do try to stick with the top few that hopefully know what they are doing. Clears it up for me though for LN.
@_date: 2017-12-31 12:49:42
Thanks for the clarification. So contracts means that LN is NOT IOUs?
@_date: 2017-12-31 10:03:51
Cannot seem to find any discussion of the role of CONTRACTS on the Lighting Network. Most discussions seem to pretend that contracts do not exist, and don't need to be updated, settled on the blockchain, etc. Even if LN uses a standard, one-size-fits-all contract, is there any difference between channel balances and contracts. Wish someone would address this aspect of LN.
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:17:16
I did actually read the white paper though it was some time ago. Just don't remember what it said about rejected blocks. I will go back and read it again though. Thanks anyway. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:17:47
If you were talking about "infallible deity" then I do agree with you. I was referring to what Satoshi had created, not just bitcoin, but in fact the whole bitcoin, cryptocurrency, blockchain ecosystem. I consider him neither a deity or a false god, more of a mythical figure. Sorry for the misunderstand. I am more interested in people, mythology and history than cryptocurrencies per se.
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:59:48
I believe both sides are claiming ownership, and claiming that the other side forked away, and that the other side's coin is "damaged goods". It's segwit + LN on one side, big blocks on the other. Yes, I have my preferences, but only by trying to stay informed and finding out to the best of my ability what is actually going on, not what the other side says is going on. So no, I do not agree with your opinion of what the "other" developer groups are doing. I do not know what you know about "that coin", that I do not, that makes you say what you do. Developers have their job to do, and generally don't pay much attention to the "sound and fury, signifying nothing" 
 [Shakespeare's Macbeth]. I really don't pay that much attention to it, I just try to keep to known facts
Sorry to sound pedantic, guess I picked that up from my father. And sorry if it doesn't help. Good luck with your coin. "Over and out". 
@_date: 2018-06-26 10:57:46
Started reading your post. Looks like you are going to get a  lot of commemts so guess I should go on reading to the end of it. Will see.

I don't think anyone has ever explained why tulips never disappeared or how much today's 'tulip market' is worth. If there is a use and a market for something it will persist. Fortunately, 'money' is one of the things that can be sent over the Internet even if tulip bulbs cannot.
@_date: 2018-04-29 02:07:36
If I remember correctly, the miners support for segwit was not unconditional there was supposed to be a 'quid pro quo' which they never got. I've never understood what obligation the miners were under to accept segwit anyway. I know Jihan isn't exactly popular here but that's how business people operate, for profit. If you want to change the terms of a contract you negotiate - even if it's only a de facto contract. Still not sure who was wrong on this point or why. ASICs may be a problem but how could developing/using them have been stopped, particularly for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-29 21:34:12
Really not sure what I think about patents.
@_date: 2018-04-30 07:40:11
The one case where you could have two chains competing long term though not as long as this has been going on would be with selfish mining in which case the cost of keeping both chains going becomes the limiting factor. Like poker it's who will fold first. Don't know how long high-stakes poker games can last but this scenario theoretically possible for Bitcoin circa 2009/10. Presumably never happened because the 'pot' was not worth the trouble.

Realistically they would end up only forking it and adding one more airdrop that may or may not have some future value. The Musketeers ('Athos', 'Porthos' and 'Aramis') are unlikely to go away.

Alexandre Dumas:  The Three Musketeers
                       Motto:  "One for all and all for one"
Comments about the {Ver, Jihan, Wright} trio always reminds me of Dumas's Musketeers particularly as it's quite an amusing, somewhat over the top story. Helps when this all gets a bit much to put up with.
Each to their own though.

'Fake' Satoshi does still get asked - paraphrasing here about 'their' coin - show me the code. He shows them patents.

Thanks. How PoS is intended to be used sounds interesting given your description of it. Not sure how many examples of good stewardship there are in this field which is why many admire him irrespective of coin.
@_date: 2018-04-29 00:34:59
You're going to need miners and developers too unless you just intend to hodl which I guess you don't. Exchanges too. Seriously, it's more than just cut and paste you actually need a business plan - maybe you think you have one -  investors too. Its rarely a one-man show which is why that 'other coin' isn't dead yet.
@_date: 2018-04-29 00:46:25
I'll take a wild guess: it's because they have a business plan? The rest is ' smoke and mirrors' all over Reddit/Twitter. Fun (and games) with Dick and Jane (and Jim Carrey).

Vitalik if (and only if?) he get his way on POS eventually replacing POW which is what he is aming for. Hybrid POW &amp; POS maybe - not at all sure if all-out POS is a good idea. Could still see a chainsplit over this which would at least be interesting. 
For what it's worth, that Vitalik isn't going after Roger or Jihan (as far as I know) tells me how important he thinks they are. While 'follow the money' still generally works maybe they are not the most important actors any more as to where their coin is going.
By the way, that is an old Apr 4th article. 
@_date: 2018-04-29 02:51:06
Aren't the miners more like a utility whose role is being confused with that of elected representatives or whatever. I got the impression that they were trying to bargain over 'cost of services' provided by them with 'services' provided by the developers - the software they are going to run. Those who felt they were caught in the middle likely ended up supporting other coins - not necessarily the forked coin - given the extent to which bitcoin's share of the overall market has changed. Don't think it was a simple 2-way split, more like 3-ways. The role of miners still needs to be figured out as per Vitalik - who at least seems to be trying, by introducing POS in combination with POW.
@_date: 2018-04-28 17:50:25
Miners and users will do whatever they want on either chain despite what so-called authorities figures say - unless there is a way to prevent them from doing so and I cannot really see it being otherwise for any coin except if constrained by its design. Persuasion is not compulsion, unless governments are 'persuaded' to get involved by those with money - because money talks - which to some extent is already happening in some countries and not just in Russia/China, but even in USA particularly over electricity usage by miners during winter months.
Miners are only relevant as long as only POW is  being used to secure the blockchain. Not sure about even a POW&amp;POS hybrid system but it may come if proven secure enough and that is where users (whether mining or not) could have even greater control over bitcoin than at present because money really is 'speech' - but only if speech can be communicated over the network in near real-time as per Lightning Network. As important as money is so also is speech and the two cannot really be separated. They are two sides of one 'freedom' coin.

One side wanted a monarchy and an established 'church' the other side a republic? The American Revolution: the USA got to keep 'america' in its name but it was once a part of British North America as was Canada though both were collection of colonies and both have different histories and anniversaries. Histories are complicated. As for Ver, seems that he is playing court joker too well for his own good.
