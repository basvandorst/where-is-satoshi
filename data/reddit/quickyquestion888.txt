What would be the $ threshold you think would be worth it to switch to a hardware wallet? I didn't mean to invest, it just happened (was going to buy things with them but then decided not to 1.5 years ago). So I only have a little more than a hundred dollars in there, but it comes out to thousands of dollars in btc now. Should I look into this, or is this more for people who have spent thousands on btc? 
Edit: have in a coinbase wallet now. I really know nothing about this and it's a bit overwhelming.

Are LTC and ETH worth investing in now?

Can some ELI5 what this means? I got the bitcoin cash from the fork, but BTC dropped quite a bit. Are the high fees permanent? Do you forsee BTC stabilizing soon?
Is BCH worth keeping or should I sell it? If I sold my BCH but kept my BTC, I'd gain 7x what I initially put in, so even if BTC crashes I won't feel that badly. But idk if BCH is going to take off. Or whether I should buy more BTC with the BCH.

I'm honestly very confused about this whole thing, I know nothing about it and my only source of information is this sub. Which I know can be very biased one way or another. 
I wish I would have taken out a couple thousand when it was so inflated but I got greedy. I think I'm still going to take out a couple hundred since I only invested a hundred in it originally, so even if it ends up dying for good I won't have lost anything.

What has changed in the market?

So why is this crash different from the past ones?

How so?
