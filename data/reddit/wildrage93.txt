How long should a BTC transfer from coinbase pro to binance take?

Can I buy chainlink on coinbase pro?

Hmm it's been pending for 60 minutes...
@_date: 2019-06-03 15:35:17
Great to see this discussion elucidated by true numbers that cant be argued against! Thankyou for the advice and putting in the time to calculate this.
@_date: 2019-06-21 17:47:14
That's why I asked for someone to explain...
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:36:26
I want to set up a sell order incase the price rapidly drops when I'm not watching. At let's say $10,000 Is this possible? Is it a limit or stop order, slightly confused. Thanks.

Considering selling all at 9950... Thoughts? I know this sub is HODL mentality, I'm all for that long term.
However there's bound to be a pull back at 10K, which would allow for some extra profits.

Thankyou for your advice, this makes a lot of sense. Just set up at limit order for 25% at 9960, let's see what happens! But with only 25% I wont feel too bad buying bad in if it just continues to rise.

This book literally arrived from Amazon yesterday! I read the foreword and prologue, about to start chapter 1: money tonight!

Would you still consider this a buy market for someone who doesn't have much invested but wants to invest a lot more, or should I be on standby incase it drops a bit.
@_date: 2019-06-03 11:39:14
I like this idea, I'll be getting to that point soon so I think I'll be getting one. Thanks.

I read 1BTC to $1mill by the end of 2020 before.....
@_date: 2019-06-03 11:38:19
Thanks, I will look into trezor and ledger, these seem to be the most popular.
@_date: 2019-06-03 13:58:21
I know very little about electrum. I will begin looking into it now, thanks!
@_date: 2019-06-03 13:15:35
Thankyou, you are right as is everyone else, it is all personal preference. I will be getting one when my investment reaches into 4 figures. Currently spending $100 + to protect $500 doesn't seem worth it to me personally, so I will wait til the figures are higher.
@_date: 2019-06-21 17:52:17
Oh, maybe I misunderstood the chart
@_date: 2019-06-19 07:28:08
Is libra something we can buy into like BTC which will go up in value, or because it's back by global currency's is this not likely to happen?
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:53:42
Is there another term for this, coinbase specifie either a limit order, or a stop limit order where I would have to specify two prices.
@_date: 2019-06-16 13:14:45
So frustrating having to wait til payday 28th to get more. Been watching it rise since 7500 to this.
@_date: 2019-05-30 21:53:08
Is it ok if I use coinbase ?
@_date: 2019-05-30 21:20:14
I'm new at this. Shouldn't I set a low point so I dotn crash all my money completely?
@_date: 2019-05-30 21:23:00
Ok got you, so buy when prices are down and hold my gut if it drops while I have money invested and trust it will rise again?
@_date: 2019-05-31 13:31:55
@_date: 2019-05-30 21:42:47
When you say down here you mean the price it's at now?
@_date: 2019-05-30 22:27:00
Ok thanks dude, I will research cold storage tomorrow. Sounds like I've got a lot of research to do! Seems to be a pretty steep learning curve so far though which is good news.
@_date: 2019-05-30 21:31:41
Ok I got you, I'm just going to buy now, not worried about if it drops in the near future, with a hope it rises in a year or two, I think that's the gist of what everyone is saying, thanks for the advice.
@_date: 2019-05-31 06:44:32
I currently have a coinbase account with $300 in, are you saying deposit this into a coinbase pro account? What are the benefits of this?
@_date: 2019-05-30 21:48:59
I'm interested in it as a long term investment, but dont want to lose all my savings, I'm considering putting a lot of spare cash into it.
 For example if you owned a house worth 200K and it dropped in value to 150K, you wouldn't hold it if you had a chance to sell knowing it's going to be worth 100K in a year.
@_date: 2019-05-30 22:06:11
Is coinbase a good wallet dude? Probably going to be depositing like 50-100 dollars once a month.

Thankyou I've been day trading for the past 2 weeks and have invested a lot of time and broke even. I've realised it's time to long term invest in BTC. Just wasnt sure on how other people are doing it. Do you have have emergency sell points or is everyone just really hopeful on a rise. This thread is helping me a lot, thanks everyone for your comments.
