i transferred some (about $70) before discovering the full amount, stopped to make sure it was legal. the other wallet shows them in there, so i assume it went though? honestly don't know much about cryptos.

not what i'm asking though. i'm trying to figure out if, legally, they sold me the bitcoin along with the computer its on. they had knowledge that data was on the computers, and even specifically mentioned it. i feel it was legally part of the sale, regardless the price they sold it for

not sure how this is relevant. if i was going to lie wouldn't i have claimed to find like $10k?
anyway. i checked the wallets randomly (there are about 15 of them), not knowing what the different coins were. the first few were worthless, many coins but they seem to be worth next to nothing. litecoin turned out to be worth about $70 total, so i sent them to another wallet. it went through so i assume they are unlocked. once i found out the other wallets had much more in them i decided not to transfer any more and instead make sure the coins were legally mine.
i don't know what "hot" and "cold" wallets even are, i'm not a crypto user, and i only ever mined curecoin. there may be "significant holdings" elsewhere, but thats not my concern.
wallets didn't show any transfers out. who knows what he was collecting them for

good point. still, reddit has people on it, and sometimes people know the law. i may consult a lawyer, but at this point that seems like a waste of money

i sent about $70 worth to a different wallet before realizing how much was there in total. the second wallet shows that amount in it now, and the original says it's less that amount. was this a successful transfer? it seems like it to me

what is this based on, though? they could say, by the same logic, that they didn't sell me ANY individual component. it wasn't just one computer as a sale. it was 9 computers and 6 boxes of other things. if one of those computers had a very valuable graphics card, would that be an exception that the estate then has claim to?
i am trying to actually figure out the legality. bitcoin isn't cash or someones bank account. are they any actual legal precedents that say bitcoin cannot be sold along with the hard drive that contains the wallet?
in the case you cited, the sellers very obviously meant to sell the house and ONLY the house, as they had already spent much time searching for the other missing valuables.

no, i actually do not want to break the law. what someone "feels" is right is not what always the law says is right. if the bitcoin can be considered part of the sale and i have a legal right to it, i want to keep it. if the law says there is some exception for bitcoin, i will return it. i just can't find a clear answer that isn't vague or opinionated.

they are not locked, so far as i can tell

this argument rejects logic. bitcoin is information and the key is information, no distinction there. if the key is needed for the bitcoin to work, it is part of the bitcoin. 
a physical key would be considered de facto "part of" a safe, car, or house, would it not? so why not the other way around? even this analogy still gives favor to the physical objects, since you can still live in the house, part out the car, or sit on the safe. without the key to a bitcoin, the bitcoin itself becomes worthless, nothing, unusable, unsalvageable.

they actually said plainly that all his data was still on the computers. they didn't request it destroyed or returned, just matter-of-factly said "all his data is still on these". yet another reason why i feel that they had every intention of selling me anything and everything that was in or on the computers, regardless of its value.
they also were selling $1000 stereo equipment at about 10% value.
