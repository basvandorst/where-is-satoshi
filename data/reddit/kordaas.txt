There is no censorship in r/bitcoin, 
Bashco is a saint and CSW is satoshi ��

0-conf are not safe on BTC! merchants can be nice and believe that it will probably be confirmed one day, but the truth is that the Mempool is never cleared!

SATOSHI CONFIRMED??  WTF!!!!
"In March 2008, just a few months before Satoshi’s paper on the Bitcoin protocol was published, Craig wrote Dave an email stating: “I need your help editing a paper I am going to release later this year. I have been working on a new form of electronic money. Bit cash, Bitcoin . . . [y]ou are always there for me Dave."
I want you to be part of it all.”

Still talking about BCH? ...but why??
@_date: 2017-10-04 10:34:33
i agree with you, Bitcoin ABC did a great job! we must learn from them!

I understand your opinion, but if they signed NYA arent they legally obligated  to follow it? Or they sign documents like little kids?
@_date: 2017-10-03 09:01:54
is r/Bitcoin about BCH? or BTC? 
i am a bit confuse...almost every discussion is about BCH....

Storing keys in plaintext is a practice shared at least by the coinomi, jaxx, and copay wallets and even other ostensibly secure apps such as WhatsApp.
But lets bash Roger Ver...our lord and savior!

Dude... Bitmain created BCH, Roger only truly joined BCH after the fail of SW2x.
