yeah, I get this.  He does have a state business license. Which helps to ease peoples minds.

They simply told me that it was not the right post for I think because of it coming off as market speculation when it is more accurately adoption speculation.

The top. Barrow. 
@_date: 2014-03-21 23:22:03
Time will tell friend.  But, I am an optimist after all.
@_date: 2014-04-09 05:43:26
I posted a link to his pricing for the ones he has in stock.  The owl is available. 
@_date: 2014-04-09 05:38:51
Exactly he only sells a dozen or two each year so this is just his introduction to the potential of btc.

My grandparents wanted nothing to do with computers and cell phones. They Social network as much if not more than I do.   Bitcoin is not a fad, it will carry us into a new era of global networking. Bitcoin is a catalyst.

Hehe *buy

To clarify, I am less interested in the price of btc.  As a business owner, I will be converting to fiat to cover my material costs and overhead.  The upside I speak of is in adoption of the protocol which will provide me with opportunities without respect to the price.  I'm not an investor, just a small business owner trying to make it in a sea of big fish.
@_date: 2014-03-22 01:24:20
He was actually quite intrigued.  I can only hope he is met with less hostility upon entering the community.  
@_date: 2014-04-23 22:18:33
He really enjoys doing it.  It is his plan for retirement, not as a major source of income, but as something creative to occupy his time. 
@_date: 2014-04-09 05:35:39
Okay folks, he is on board.  Up until today he only sold whatever he had made that winter at local holiday craft bazaars in Barrow so he never did high volume.  This will be his step toward future commercialization.
Thanks to everyone for the suggestions.  I am putting together a web page for him which will be  give me a couple days to make it happen.  In the mean time, he sent me his [pricing for the pieces]( that he has at the moment, he can make custom work too if you have a design.  I suspect that for custom work, he will ask for half down.  I will set him up with bitpay in the near future and post those details on his site.  
If you absolutely need one of these pieces now, I set him up with a coinbase account and explained to him how to send a request for payment.  I can PM you his personal email if you want to contact him now, or later this week ill put his new email on his website.  I don't expect people to blindly send a stranger btc, but my pops is probably the most honest person I know, On his [facebook page]( there are several people who have commented on their purchase and can vouch for his integrity.
He will be shipping these from zip 99723, so you can use the usps shipping calculator to estimate your shipping costs.  
Thanks again for the suggestions and I'll keep posting details this week.

Yea, they are simple, but they look great in a window.  I wish I had pics of some of his larger custom works which were amazing.  He will be retired, so I think his profitability comes after satisfying his routine with something he enjoys doing.
@_date: 2014-03-21 23:03:43
Oh, you mean my reddit account.  Gotcha.
@_date: 2014-04-08 07:59:43
He will be retiring from teaching in Alaska in a couple years and plans to make his creations full time.  I think it would be cool if he used btc as his preferred method of payment.
@_date: 2014-03-21 23:12:37
Wow, I'm under attack here.  Maybe my intentions were misconstrued.  I am speaking to the ability to tx funds without a bank.  To me that is incredibly valuable and I was just posting to state the fact that most processing entities that I have encountered do not know what btc is, let alone understand the potential effects on their business model.
@_date: 2014-04-08 18:57:03
He uses layers of cardboard to sandwich it together and then puts that in an oversized box.  He could insure them for damage as a precaution.
@_date: 2014-03-21 23:14:15
I am simply the messenger.  Perhaps the public disclosure of my experiences is something I will not pursue in the future...
@_date: 2014-04-08 18:59:18
Yes he has done some larger pieces for peoples homes up here.  They are an inviting piece for a front window.
@_date: 2014-04-08 08:45:30
He has been in AK for 17 years.  He usually just makes them to sell at small art shows.  He has done some really cool custom ones over the years.  I'm sure he would be happy to look over your design idea. 
@_date: 2014-04-23 22:17:33
This is really cool! I like the style
@_date: 2014-03-23 03:19:55
What seedpod02 is alluding to sums my point.  The more people I talk to, the more I realize that btc hasn't even found many people yet.  This is actually good news.  It means that there are many bubbles ahead of us as the trend  of news, curiosity, participation, fail/success, repeat.  
@_date: 2014-03-22 01:25:14
Ah yes, but 2 months, that is a lifetime.
@_date: 2014-03-22 00:06:17
It blows me away too.  I tell everyone who will listen about my thoughts on btc.  Most professionals that I have met either have heard very little, or nothing at all.  I'm not in IT or web related industry so I guess it shouldn't be surprising.  The fact that 9/10 of my conversations with bank personal end in a resounding 'what is btc again', leads me to believe we are only on the cusp of its understanding on the whole. 
@_date: 2014-03-21 22:51:59
Thanks to for pointing out my improper submission previously.
@_date: 2014-04-08 09:01:32
Hey oh!  I'll put in the order. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 17:44:56
You would be surprised.  There are a lot of small time gold miners in Alaska to this day.  My neighbor is a bartender at the Howlin' Dog Saloon.  Miners come in from their claims to get a drink.  Some pay with gold.  The bar doesn't get paid in gold. The bartender does, and she pays the bar with her cash tips.  People trade other shit all the time.  Just because you don't barter doesn't mean it isn't happening.  Fiat is just an IOU to break up the goods and services you trade into useful pieces.  Bitcoin serves this purpose and more.
@_date: 2014-03-21 23:02:57
Can you explain 'zero day accounts' please?
@_date: 2014-03-21 23:35:34
As someone who has no idea what reddit 'karma' actually does, my answer would be, to contribute and communicate with like-minded people.  
Since most of the replys have been off base from my intended goal.  I will see myself out.
@_date: 2014-03-22 00:00:56
Your definition of anything is &gt; my definition of anything.  Sure, it is not yet prolific enough for your convenience.  But the technology is adapting to meet demand.  
I wish I lived in a metropolitan area to try this, but I thought it would be interesting to post an ad in local listing "Buy me a beer for btc".
It would be fun to see the responses from locals, not to mention a thrilling way to meet new btc community members.
If I ever go to NYC I'll pm you.  Take me out to the bar of your choice and I'll pay for your beers with my dollars and you can give me your btc.  If we are cool you may even get a bonus beer as a freebie for playing along!
@_date: 2014-03-22 00:10:53
Thanks OP! I agree that you could broden some of the questions to include why do we want btc to succeed.  Interesting to see peoples' desired end games.
@_date: 2014-03-21 23:42:18
Yes my child, I appreciate the input.  I guess that I was hopeful to hear of others with the same story.  Most of the people in my circle have never heard of btc so they have little to teach me other than of their unfamiliarity.
