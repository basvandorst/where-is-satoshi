ProtonMail's main advantage is that it's set up so they do not view your mail nor do they scan it for marketing and advertising data. That was bad enough when it was all Google was doing, but as they recklessly push into medical data and other areas I felt compelled to make every effort to get out of their ecosystem. Otherwise it's a regular e-mail service.was
The process I described is to do an import of all your Gmail messages. It leaves everything in your Gmail inbox, it just makes a copy in your ProtonMail inbox. Leading up to the import, I had also done an account-by-account audit of all my online services and mailing lists and switched them to ProtonMail, so at this point my Gmail has basically stopped receiving new messages.
You could set up Gmail to automatically forward all your messages to ProtonMail, which would be easier, but Google would still have access to your data that way. My object was to make a complete and total switch and cut Google off from my data as best I can, going forward.

To note, I am on the paid Professional plan, and this option may only be available to paid ProtonMail users, I'm not 100% sure. While Pro is expensive it's definitely the most convenient and with multi-user support you may even be able to get someone else on-board with you on their own login and collect "rent" to help pay, or downgrade to a cheaper plan once your import is finished. I got a couple sweetheart deals on my Pro plan so I'm going to hold onto it.
The first step is to make sure your Gmail is configured to enable IMAP, which you can find in the email ⚙️ Settings &gt; Forwarding and POP/IMAP.
The next thing you'll want to do is configure your labels. This threw me for the longest time, because I have an account with many labels, and ProtonMail's Import/Export tool tends to choke on high numbers of labels. To do this, go over to the Labels tab in Gmail's settings and only turn on the labels that you *absolutely* need by checking "Show in IMAP", otherwise, turn them off.
Finally, if you have 2FA enabled on your Google account, you'll want to make an app password. This can be made in your Google account settings &gt; Security &gt; App Passwords.
Basically, if you've ever used an external client (e.g. Thunderbird, or a third-party email app on your phone) the setup is the same here.
Once your Gmail is set up, you can use the official Import/Export tool available here: 
Log into your ProtonMail account on the tool, and then open the address you want to import to. I used my main account, though in retrospect it may have been a better idea to just set up a dedicated address (e.g. [myaddress].gmail as it has affected the performance on my main ProtonMail app slightly.
The I/E tool should give you a prompt to log in to your Gmail account, and will automatically pick ports and other configs - all you have to do is provide your login address and the app password. 
You can try a flat import of your entire Gmail, but depending on how long you've had it and how many messages you have it may or may not work correctly or may start but crash before completion. I have had my Gmail for nearly a decade now so flat imports tended to crash out, even after I pruned my IMAP labels down.
What I ended up doing instead was filtering each import down to a specific year (e.g. on the bottom, selecting all messages from 1/1/2011 to 12/31/2011) and then giving each import a year label (e.g. G:2011), which is in-line with my other archiving practices. The I/E tool worked much better after narrowing it to a year, even if it entailed more babysitting.
If you get a crash, don't fret. The I/E tool seems pretty good at recognizing dupes, and will not re-import a message that's already imported.
Attachments should all import too, and inline images if they were attached. Non-attached external images should still work, but will only work if the service in question is still around.
EDIT: One final thing to note: Gmail, web ProtonMail and the ProtonMail App all seem to count messages a little differently for their inbox totals. In particular, web ProtonMail seems to count all unread "Message chains" (e.g. if a person or service emails you and then e-mails you again) as a single message, while the App seems to count each email as one message. So there will likely be a degree of variation between your Gmail totals and web ProtonMail totals, but as long as the app is close to your Gmail total, your import likely worked.

When the streets are on fire, bitcoin can be a lot more secure than cash in a register or safe or real estate that's inadvertently become the target of a molotov-tossing mob, and give you something to hold you over in the interim between disaster and disaster response. And as Venezuela shows, if the state IS the disaster, it becomes even more useful still.
