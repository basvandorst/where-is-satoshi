Also when depositing to bitstamp what is the best payment method in terms of lowest fees? My local bank charges a 20-30 dollar fee on my end alone! Could I deposit the money to the bitstamp account using western union or even PayPal?

What miner are you using? I have a gtx470 and wouldn't mind doing some mining on it regardless of the inevitable low mhash rate.

Just curious, once lets say I have sold a bitcoin and there is money in my bitstamp account, how does that money then get back to me? Also do you have to make a physical cash deposit at a bank? Or can I use online banking and transfer funds that way?

By create do you just mean add another receiving address? Or can I use the one that came with my client?

I agree although I doubt they'd outright scam like that, they've got over 40 000 preorders and their factory and operators are known, knowing america they could probably already be sued.

Thats so annoying I use GUI miner on my ati PC but whenever I try and run it with the nvidia card it just doesn't work. Are you using the CUDA miner?

I don't really know how it works is there actually an exchange service or are you dealing directly with other buyers/sellers? Also the buy and sell prices are completely overpriced and undervalued respectively, compared to what most exchanges are saying av. prices are?

Pretty sure there was a thread a few days ago about some guy who went to the factory. Although they weren't shipping units there was people working on the smaller jalapeño units. I think they underestimated the demand for them or how many they could make and got blinded by all the preorders they were getting so they couldn't bring themselves to stop preorders. Either way its useless buying these units because once (if) they ship them out the blockchain difficulty is going to go up like 40 times rendering them almost useless!
