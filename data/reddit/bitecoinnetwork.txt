The point is, if the delivery of the food item (a) reaches on time at the delivery point supplied by the customer, the contract enforces automatically - that is one parameter of the contract is approved (or is successful), the time.
(b) the succesful "product" delivery is when the user approves it, either through their own app or with the app held by the delivery boy.
"(a)" can be tracked by the delivery boy's GPS location embedded on the app.
"(b)" can be tracked only with explicit consent from the customer.

I completely understand where you are coming from and thank you for your feedback. 
Our idea is to propose a value to the customer where he/she is can rely on the platform itself to safeguard their money. Smart contract along with escrow account function simultaneously to ensure that upon non deliverance, the cash is refunded to the customer instantly. Gone will be those day where customers calls in and yelling to us for refund. :)
Upon successful delivery, customer also gets token incentives for each invoice. 
All of this is possible only using smart contracts.

smart contract based. If delivery is not successful, users money is refunded by the escrow. Plus user gets incentives - equal amount of tokens on each invoice which can then be traded in exchange. check this out.
