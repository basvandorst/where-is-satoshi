No. I want the security and decentralization of Bitcoin. 
This is my issue, I guess. A high fee model prices out certain demographics and they are told to 'go use Bcash or LTC' which doesn't have nearly the security or decentralization that BTC does. Then when they lose their money, they're told they should've bought BTC. ����‍♂️
@_date: 2019-04-02 05:00:34
Yea, that’s my point. It will get worked out eventually. 
We have the ability to lower fees right now with a block size increase that will be needed eventually anyway. Why not do it? What's the risk?
@_date: 2019-04-05 17:08:56
Do you use Bitcoin? This is at TINY volume. The default fee in my wallet right now is $2.21 to send $20. Yes. There are ways around the default fee. Or I could just use another coin. ����‍♂️
@_date: 2019-04-01 22:45:18
When I say years away, I mean intermediate adoption. I don’t disagree with you for the most part. But we need a block size increase for lightning anyway. The longer we wait, the harder and more dangerous it will be, no?
@_date: 2019-04-08 23:41:20
Good argument. This post will still be here if you think of one.��
Where are you getting $79 a day? The entire blockchain is only ~ 225 GB right now and it's 10 years old.
But, are you okay spending $80 per transaction?
@_date: 2019-04-08 21:00:38
You told me to learn how Bitcoin works?
You realize that the amount of people using Bitcoin has literally nothing to do with how much the chain grows right? It grows at the pace of the size of blocks. 1 block is mined every 10 minutes no matter how many people are using it. With a 1MB block size, that is roughly 50 GB per year. 
A 500 GB HDD costs $25 on Newegg. 
Hence the reason I am in favor of raising the block size.
@_date: 2019-04-08 18:06:26
I've been ranting on Twitter about this. 
They don't want to raise the block size on purpose. The plan is to choke the block size for high fees. BTC has the most hash power, so it is the most secure chain. And if you want to use the most secure chain, you have to pay the market price. They want the market price to use Bitcoin (the most secure chain), to be extremely high. And if you can't afford it, you're forced to use a cheaper, more insecure chain. They want BTC to be used by governments and banks as digital gold, not cash. In the future, Bitcoin will be a way for governments and millionaires to move around their gold piles, for a very high fee. Will this make BTC extremely valuable? Probably. But it's not the Bitcoin I signed up for. I think EVERYONE should have an opportunity to use Bitcoin's censorship resistance. And I think Bitcoin was intended to be used as cash. Which is why I put all of my BTC into cold storage and am now using  BCH.
Also, lightning is a Trojan horse. It will be the only exit from layer 1, and will be lined with micro toll booths.
@_date: 2019-04-09 02:21:48
Why does it matter if it creates another useless altcoin? The one that has the highest proof of work will be BTC. Bcash was a complete war and they walked away with 4% of the hash rate. They had to implement an emergency hard fork and change the code. Every other altcoin fork would be forced to change the code to avoid being completely locked up.
@_date: 2019-04-08 23:21:02
By the time demand for block space grew that large, it would be decades. There are 1 TB micro SD cards right now. You can buy a 256 GB micro SD card for $79. This is a non-issue.

Still waiting on a good reason?
@_date: 2019-04-02 00:18:34
How am I going in circles? I want lower fees. Lower fees are achievable by raising the block size. 
Do you want higher fees? If so, why? I don't think it's a very tough choice for most people. 
Do you want to pay more or less?
@_date: 2019-04-09 14:44:41
You quoted the HDD part and then completely disregarded it in your response. 
Which reason will make people less likely to run a node? 
$5 a year HDD space or 60 cents per transaction?
The bandwidth is not an issue, either. The average global internet speed is increasing faster than ever in history. 
You don’t make any sense. That’s why I don’t accept this as a valid response. Do you have a better reason? 
The trade off is virtually 0.
@_date: 2019-04-08 23:10:57
I don't think you understand how scaling works. It's done in small increments over time. 1 billion people aren't going to all of a sudden start using Bitcoin tomorrow. But enough people are using it today that the 1 MB blocks are FULL. We would only need to double it to meet todays demands. And as demand grows, we create more available space. 
The demand for block space creates the fee market. We could easily create more block space to alleviate fees in the short term until things start to move off chain with Lightning, etc. 
Give me a good reason why we aren't? You like paying more?
@_date: 2019-04-09 02:11:41
Point out my lies. Specifically. 
"Ironically, you are wrong. Hard block size increase is both risky and harmful."
Risky how? Harmful how? You aren't saying anything. What points that refute me? Please number them. 
�� How do miners benefit from larger blocks? They get the block reward no matter what. They would get less fees if the block size was raised. You aren't making sense.

Understandable position in your scenario, however, I feel like the chain is already large enough that the propogation problems are already in place. Is it that big of a difference if the blockchain is 250 GB in a year vs 255 GB?
Would you consider a dynamic block size that changes with the demand of block space?

@_date: 2019-04-02 00:09:01
Yes. This is exactly my point. Even with Segwit, batching, etc, fees are still very high. The block size needs raised whether lightning works perfectly or not. I just don't understand the motivation of waiting for consensus to be harder to reach. The sooner the better. Altcoins have been good testnets. I think it's time to act.

All you said it that they were risky and dangerous. I read the posts back.
@_date: 2019-04-08 22:13:04
I don't understand this. You would rather the Fed take over Bitcoin than simply raise the block size?
@_date: 2019-04-02 04:38:16
I agree. I think it would be a good idea to have a dynamic block size that is based on demand for block space. That way if the mempool is full, it can be cleared out with 1 or 2 blocks rather than backlogging.
@_date: 2019-04-09 01:49:46
We know that the block size can be raised without any issues. It's been stress tested and works fine. 
You still haven't answered anything. 
I can name lots of companies that benefit from small blocks. 
Can you name anything that benefits from increasing the block size other than the users?
Or any downside to raising the block size?
Feel free to link me to a roadmap of Bitcoin Core where it says they plan to raise the block size. They don't want it raised. They like the high fees. Ask them yourself.
@_date: 2019-04-05 02:40:34
How long before the average person is using channel factories? 
I agree. I'm not looking for much. A raise to 2 MB would solve a lot of problems and mitigate the short term fee issues. And it will eventually be needed no matter what in my opinion. 
I think other Bitcoin implementations, like Bcash have served as good live testnets. They don't have the amount of txs as BTC, but fees would still be lower if they did. I don't think they would have any problems. It's been stress-tested.
@_date: 2019-04-09 06:45:57
I disagree. What makes your opinion more valid than mine?
How does a block size increase harm centralization? You can buy a 500 GB HDD for $25. That is 5+ years of storage. 
Global average bandwidth went up by 23% last year alone.

Thank you for admitting that no post of your position exists. 
I was forced into Bcash by people like you for ruining BTC without being able to explain why. You priced me out of the market. Why would I pay $2 transaction fees when I can pay a fraction of a penny. I would like to use Bitcoin (it is the most secure, decentralized chain) but it is too expensive even for me. And I'm a middle class American. Congratulations. You've priced out 95% of the population from ever using it. Genius. ��������
Just 1 link to any position will do.

How do you figure? Next block fee is 59 sat/b. 
I just pulled out my wallet and the default fee is 63 cents to send $20. The lowest it will go is 21 cents. That’s not high?
@_date: 2019-04-01 21:38:53
Waiting will only make it harder and more dangerous to hardfork when the time comes. 
I just synced a couple weeks ago in less than 10 hours. It’s an issue, no doubt. But having the initial sync take longer and lower the fees forever is a trade off I’m willing to make.

@_date: 2019-04-02 02:29:55

Perfect example:
3 cents shouldn't even be considered low. 
@_date: 2019-04-09 03:05:48
Ok I will literally ELI5 you, since I'm obviously speaking to a child. 
1. Raising the block size doesn't centralize anything. There are $25 500 GB HDD's. That is 5+ years of storage. $5 a year to be your own bank.  And as technology increases they will only get cheaper. You argue that that is too much money, yet 60 cent transaction fees for a single transaction are fine. Please explain. 
2. Same thing with bandwidth, so save that argument. Global average internet speeds went up by 23% last year alone. 
I'll wait for these to be answered to proceed.
@_date: 2019-04-01 23:51:24
How is it a rushed decision? It's been debated for 6 years and other chains have successfully done it. 
@_date: 2019-04-08 23:00:38
Lol. You just described what Bitcoin was designed to be. The only reason that you can't have that is because the block size is being intentionally choked to ARTIFICIALLY create high fees. That is a free market to you?
As far as I see it, we don't have consensus right now. Most people that own BTC couldn't tell you what a blockchain is, much less comment on block size proposals. This leaves us stuck at a 'default' consensus which is to do nothing. 
Lightning needs a block size increase to scale as well. There is literally an entire section dedicated to block size increases in the LN white paper. 
I've yet for anyone to give me a valid reason for not raising it. 
But I can see LOTS of reasons why certain companies with vested interests in sidechains would want to keep the fees high.
@_date: 2019-04-09 03:26:25
I'm tired of going in circles. 
You: it centralizes the chain
Me: No it doesn't and here's why. 
You can buy a 500 GB HDD for $25. They will only get cheaper. That is 5+ years of running a full node. There are 256 GB micro SD cards for $80. They will only get cheaper in the next 5 years. 
Global average internet speeds are growing fast. It was up 23% last year. 
For some reason you think that the internet speed needs to double with the hard drive size. That does not make any sense whatsoever. 
You: ??????? Someone is paying you.
@_date: 2019-04-08 21:11:03
What is the uncertainty? We've had several "live" testnets from other Bitcoin implementations. Other models are already built and they are functional blockchains.

I still have my BTC, but if I guess I'll have to use BCH if I want to actually USE my Bitcoin without paying enormous fees. 
What is the advantage of BTC? 
It's uncensorable? So is BCH? 
It's decentralized? So is BCH. 
Genesis block? Same as BCH

You're worried about the 3rd world, but they are the ones you're pricing out with the transaction fees. What's the point of running a node if you can't afford to transact? The median fee right now is 60 cents. 
And how can they open a lightning channel if it requires an on-chain transaction to open and close channels?
It is extremely cheap for everyone to run a full node right now and is only getting cheaper. 
What's next?

@_date: 2019-04-08 21:38:55
In your opinion, why aren't we raising the block size?
The chain only grows by roughly 50 GB per year and a 500 GB HDD only costs $25. They also make 256 GB micro SD cards that sell for $80. I don't believe a block size increase would harm decentralization. 
I don't believe bandwidth is an issue either. The average internet speed is growing rapidly. Global average internet speeds went up by 23% last year alone. 
Also, we've now had several other Bitcoin implementations serve as live testnets. They've shown no problems and some have even been stress tested. 
Segwit hasn't done enough to alleviate fees in the short term and lightning still seems a couple years away. Why no block size increase while we wait?
@_date: 2019-04-01 20:36:14
I think it is still years away because it is too complicated to use. Yes, it works today if you have tons of capacity and a lot of sats, but you also seem to need a degree in network management. Getting my capacity where it needs to be seems a challenge. The minimum capacity to open a channel with tipping.me (a micropayment tipping platform) is .03 BTC (~$115). 
Segwit hasn't seemed to help the fees very much. The lowest fee I can get right now (Coolwallet S) is 18 cents to send $20. The default fee is 55 cents. Not even close to good enough. 
I’ve never been for raising the block size limit in the past, but the realization of lightning being so far off (in my opinion), I think it’s time. I would be in favor of a small block size increase (2-4MB). And even more in favor of a dynamic increase based on demand.

I think you've been misled. Raising the block size was how Satoshi designed Bitcoin to scale. 
Other companies have vested interests in keeping the block size low to force users off chain and into their sidechains. 
What companies have an incentive to raise the block size?
None. The users benefit from lower fees.
@_date: 2019-04-03 12:59:54

@_date: 2019-04-04 16:33:36
Exactly. That's why we need a small block size increase right now to mitigate fees in the short term. Lightning will need a block size increase in the future anyway. 
A small increase will not jeopardize running your own node. If the blockchain were over 500 GB today, would you still run your own node? Of course.

What is your specific reason for not wanting to increase the block size?
@_date: 2019-04-08 19:41:16
Why would we "need high fees" on layer 1? Fees weren't even supposed to come into play for 150 years. 
You say there is no feasible way, but all we have to do is raise the block size. Not infinitely and forever, but definitely when blocks are full. This is how Satoshi designed Bitcoin to be scaled.
@_date: 2019-04-02 04:13:58
Exactly. And if lightning is going to move us off chain eventually anyway, then block propagation issues and initial sync times will come to a halt eventually. So the blockchain will grow a lot slower once Lightning is used more widely. And a block increase is needed for lightning anyway. Seems like a no-brainer. Would love to hear opposing opinions. 
@_date: 2019-04-08 20:50:37
I know how Bitcoin works. I've been using it for nearly 5 years. 
I'm trying to improve it by discussing a very much needed block size increase. For some reason no one wants to do it and can't give any valid reasons why not. (Yourself included). 
@_date: 2019-04-03 12:49:48
How do you propose we scale, then? Lightning needs a block size increase. Will that be harder to achieve now or later? There is a whole section in the LN white paper:
“10 Block Size Increases and Consensus
If we presume that a decentralized payment network exists and one user will make 3 blockchain transactions per year on average, Bitcoin will be able to support over 35 million users with 1MB blocks in ideal circumstances (assuming 2000 transactions/MB, or 500 bytes/Tx). This is quite limited, and an increase of the block size may be necessary to support everyone in the world using Bitcoin. A simple increase of the block size would be a hard fork, meaning all nodes will need to update their wallets if they wish to participate in the network with the larger blocks.
While it may appear as though this system will mitigate the block size increases in the short term, if it achieves global scale, it will necessitate a block size increase in the long term. Creating a credible tool to help prevent blockchain spam designed to encourage transactions to timeout becomes imperative.”
@_date: 2019-04-01 21:28:28

Transactions aren't cheap. That's the problem. 
Raising the block size will not affect decentralization. The chain only grows 50 GB per year right now. If we quadrupled the block size, it would only grow by 200 GB per year and would cost ~ $10 per year to maintain your own node. 
How will that centralize it?
You don't raise it unless the demand to raise it is there. Right now it is.

This is at least a fair and reasonable response. More than most that I've gotten. 
I do agree that security and efficiency are extremely important. 
But I disagree that a small block size increase would create centralization. You can buy a 500 GB HDD for $25. That's 5+ years worth of storage even with an increase to 2 MB. $5 a year to be your own bank. Even the 80% of the population living on less than $5 a day could afford this. 
You know what they can't afford? 
60 cent transaction fees.
@_date: 2019-04-08 22:02:11
Exactly. We can't. You would need more than 144 blocks, or you would need to make the blocks larger than 1 MB. The mempool would be backlogged until it caught up.

My Twitter is a couple years old. I've been 'involved' with Bitcoin for a few years. What does the age of my account have to do with my points? Feel free to point to the 'debunking'.
Up until the past few weeks I have defended BTC and small blocks. Check my Twitter. I follow you. It's come to my conclusion that the block size will never be raised. That changes things a lot for me.

No. They are 2-3% on [LN Power Users](

I just think it's worth the trade off. I'd rather wait for the initial sync and have low fees forever. But I can sync the blockchain in around 10 hours right now. Not sure why it would ever take 10 months, but I'll take your word for it.

Unfortunately, after using it for a few months, I’ve come to the realization that it is still years away. And nothing is being done about the fees in the short term. 
@_date: 2019-04-09 00:22:28
Why is there no need? The blocks are full. The median fee is 60 cents per transaction.

It’s a pretty beefy gaming pc:
i7 4930k
GTX 780 classified 
32GB RAM
128 GB SSD
3x 1 TB HDD
I agree. I definitely don’t speak for everyone. Just wondering why more aren’t speaking about it. 
It is a 100% fact that we will need a block size limit increase in the future, even if lightning works perfectly. 
It is also a fact that the more people that join the network, the harder that will be to achieve. Not sure why anyone is against it. These altcoins you speak of have proven it to work in lowering fees and not having (m)any problems. 
The problem with using other coins:
Do you want lower fees? Yes. 
Ok, just use an altcoin. 
Do you use altcoins? Yes
Also, I want the security of Bitcoin. Not some centralized shitcoin.

You are literally stupid. 
Why would you not want to be able to? 
And how would I move it off chain? Lightning doesn't work. I've tried it and am running a node. It's worthless right now. Let me pay money to open up a bunch of channels to move my micropayments around. Genius idea. Will be years before it's ready. But keep telling yourself it's right around the corner while BCH and BSV steal it's market share. You're doing a great job helping BTC.����

Feel free to give it a shot. 
I'm a troll for wanting Bitcoin to work? Do you hear yourself?
@_date: 2019-04-09 00:53:56
No, the blocks are full because there is demand for block space. And this demand has a market price. We can easily create more space by raising the block size. 
If the demand went down, the blocks wouldn't be full. No one is spamming the chain while the median fee is 60 cents per transaction. Feel free to link to any kind of proof of the chain being spammed ever. 
In my opinion, the block size is being choked to create these artificially high fees. 
The only mess left to clean is raising the block size. What is your personal reason for not wanting to?
@_date: 2019-04-09 03:16:27
Guess I will take the advice of smart people and not argue with an idiot. 
You refuse to point out, repeat, or link any argument other than that it centralizes things, which I clearly pointed out isn't the case several times and you haven't refuted it. 
Guess we'll leave the post here for anyone that can answer. It clearly won't be you.✌��

You can't have it both ways. You want to wait until there is more adoption to fork, but if there is more adoption, consensus is harder. ����‍♂️
@_date: 2019-04-02 05:10:37
This is what's baffling. Their argument is that it will cause centralization by making the block size too big and the chain will get too big for people to run their own node. 
But if lightning is taking us off chain, then block propogation and initial sync will not be a problem in the future because it will come to a halt. 
@_date: 2019-04-01 23:52:50
What's there to get? Explain what I'm missing?
@_date: 2019-04-09 07:05:36
There are 1 TB micro SD cards (256 GB for $80). This is not an issue. The entire chain is only ~225 GB and only grows 35-50GB a year. 
I agree that 2nd layer solutions are the answer, but why not raise the block size to mitigate fees in the short term?
Lightning needs a block size increase to scale anyway. There is an entire section dedicated to block size increases in the LN white paper.
@_date: 2019-04-09 01:38:58
Well I don't fit any of those descriptions. I love Bitcoin. 
You say that no one can know, but we do know. That's what we have a testnet for. And now we have other 'live' Bitcoin implementations that have served as testnets and been stress tested. 
Other than personal attacks on me, what is your personal opinion why the block size should not be raised?
@_date: 2019-04-04 18:37:47
That's why they are supposed to be done in small increments, as stated by Satoshi. 
Lightning needs a block size increase to scale. It HAS to be done anyway. 
@_date: 2019-04-09 04:58:17
Yea, I'm well aware. I've recently started buying Bcash because we refuse to raise the block size. And I've been using lightning and it sucks pretty badly. If you look at my Twitter, you will read hundreds of posts of me vehemently defending BTC over the past 2+ years. And for roughly 2 years before that in various places.
If we don't raise the block size, Bitcoin will NEVER be cash. Not with the lightning network, not with sidechains, etc. The block size is designed to be raised. That is a fact. Satoshi wrote it very plainly. 
I now believe that the block size is intentionally being choked to artificially create high fees. There is virtually 0 risk to raising the block size. I have yet to hear a valid argument as to why it shouldn't. Now people are saying that it should never be raised. We're purposely stuck at a 'default'consensus which is to do nothing. 
The consequences of this are that Bitcoin will always have the highest fees of any coin because it will always be the most secure (most hash). But the block size controls the fees of the network. This is Bitcoin's weakness if it's constricted. 
But it only has the most hash because people bought it thinking they would be able to use it as cash. Now the roadmap is a way for millionaires and governments to move their gold piles around. 
Will this make Bitcoin extremely valuable if it succeeds? Probably. That's why I put all of my BTC in cold storage. 
But this isn't a roadmap I believe in. I bought Bitcoin to be financially free and to USE it as digital cash.

�� Wow. I love how everyone says this yet no one can explain why. Try thinking for yourself for once. ✌����
