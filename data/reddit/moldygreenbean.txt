Billionaires aren't in cahoots with one another. If all the billionaires started buying bitcoin, they would try to fuck one another over in the process. Plus price for each bitcoin would sky rocket to an unrealistic number and more billionaires/millionaires would be born.

keep coins in the vault. Off-site, physically secure, off-line, data-center. 
99.99% more secure than leaving it on your home computer. 
The catch is if you decide to sell it takes several days to go from the vault to your online wallet.

The vault is off line in a physically hardened facility. Compared to the site you connect to which is connected to the internet and leaves it susceptible to major data breach. 
You can only transfer coins in the vault to your wallet, not to another wallet. 
Two factor authentication is required to transfer from the vault to your wallet.

I'm talking to someone at the company now. I'm considering it but the risk is high, considering there is nothing on the internet aside from Facebook. Have you found anything since this post?

I spoke to the assistance to the CEO. They will accept credit card payment for 3,900.00
I'm still skeptical. Why not charge 1,000.00 and let the person use that 2,900.00 for capital and then accept charges. They said if you don't become profitable after the initial 3,900.00 you don't owe them anymore money.
