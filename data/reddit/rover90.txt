I've heard that too... they're usually the ones who voted for him.

Understood, but it seems that nowadays you can't be all things to all laws.  I choose to follow (reluctantly) the IRS definition.
At some point we have to pit the "Law" against itself and sit back and watch the carnage.  Who wants to go first?

I think we have two separate conversations going on in this thread at the same time.

The title of this post should be "Blacklisted because of Coinbase".  
Coinbase didn't actively do anything to have your bank blacklist you.

Yes, please cite references.

I agree. 
Either way it sounds like the backdoor has the ability to override the standard global data encryption employed in iOS. 
A Bitcoin Wallet worth anything should be using its own encryption on top of that. 
Unless there is also a key logger tied to the backdoor [anyone know?], those apps should be reasonably secure?

Also, this.

At this point, it seems it's all a matter of interpretation of the law.
Mine is:
BTC is considered an asset by the IRS.
Selling any amount of BTC for cash would be similar to selling any other asset, i.e. Vehicle, Property, etc..
Walking away with any amount of cash isn't in itself, illegal.
Legality comes into question only at the time you decide whether  or not to report the capital gains, and whether you are truthful in your reporting.

Wouldn't radio static in a faraday cage shielded from interstellar cosmic radio waves and all domestic transmissions be more predictable than radio static out in the wild?  I'm honestly trying to wrap my head around this.
Perhaps it deserves its own thread.

We can look around now and think "there's so much potential, why isn't this happening?!"... but Opportunity &amp; Innovation - the parents that will eventually create Bitcoin's killer app- haven't even met yet.

Wow. A one man pissing contest.

Harry, Harry, where do you go when the lights go out!

Oh, the irony.

Aside from the blurred pic issue here on Reddit...
If you're serious about long term cold storage, you should be careful &amp; knowledgable of the how these laser / cnc / cutting machines store their data.
Especially because these machines tend to be shared resources.

Imagine you are purchasing something at a store for $25.
In your wallet you have one $20 bill and one $10 bill.
You cannot tear the $10 bill in half and add it to your $20 to make $25.
You must hand both bills to the clerk, and they must give you a $5 bill as change.
Setting aside the miner fee, Bitcoin works almost the same way, with one exception;  You don't rely on the clerk(recipient) to make the change... you (your wallet software) calculate it yourself and include the change amount and address in the transaction. 
At the end of this process, all inputs are spent... some go to the recipient, and some go to a newly created change address in your control.
Hope that helps.

As far as I know, a wallet will usually try to pick the smallest number of input addresses to make up the necessary amount. 
So no, not every address in your wallet is used every time.
The "all inputs must be spent" architecture is actually meant to simplify transaction processing. Satoshi explains this in the white paper :

Saw the pic and that answer seems a bit inaccurate. Did the winner correct Alex?

This seems to be a browser based interface issue.
Deleting the auto-generated vaults works via the iOS app.
