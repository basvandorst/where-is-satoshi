Yes, any fees paid are deducted from the capital gain; don’t forget any fees paid on the buy side as well.

I just put my public key in my profile and received an encrypted e-mail (and signed) from Facebook that my mail client was able to decrypt. It seems they are following the way to send PGP e-mails correctly. Facebook isn't implementing anything other than PGP.

I'm sure the lawyer wouldn't accept contingency in this case.

The margin on gas is pennies per gallon. They do count on people coming inside to buy other things for higher margins.

This sounds an awful lot like Freenet. How do you distinguish yourself from that?

The IRS knows what your normal income is from your tax returns and what your employer withholds.
If you're making $50,000 a year at a job and then suddenly payoff a $100,000+ mortgage, that may raise a few questions on where you got the money to do that. It might take them a few years to catch up to this but the chance is there.

A router that support uPnP doesn't open all ports and forward it to your computer. Software on the computer requests a port to be forwarded to the router and if the router supports uPnP and it's enabled, it will forward the port requested by the software and only that port to the computer.

I have the CoinBase app on my phone. It requires an account with CoinBase but it can send and receive Bitcoins.

Definitely not for the big conglomerates. The independent stations are the ones that would like you to come in to buy additional items in the convenience store. That's what I was referring to.

It's trying to use a graphics card to mine and you don't have one with OpenCL capabilities. That's why you are getting that message.
I'm not familiar with GUIminer but for something like bfgminer you have to tell it what device you have connected. Maybe that's what you're missing? If GUIminer can handle a USB block eruptor then you might need to tell it to look for one and maybe even point it to the COM port it's on.

SHA-256 is a hashing function not an encryption function. Once something is hashed, there's no way to go back to the original data.

What does this have to do with Bitcoin? See the third bullet point under "Community guidelines".

Front desk means hotel front desk not the casino.

The sign says that it's accepted at the front desk, which means you can pay for your hotel room with Bitcoin. I'm sure the casino doesn't accept it so you're not going to gamble without converting it first.

I don't mean to be cold-hearted but the second rule in this section says no begging personally for coins.

I'm not sure. There was either a link posted here or in about it within the past month. Two big investors who own a lot of Bitcoins were filing to start an ETF on the exchanges.

Someone was putting together a Bitcoin ETF (Exchange Traded Fund). Once that happens you'll be able to invest in Bitcoin through the stock market.

I believe that is correct.

Isn't that what Local Bitcoins can do?
