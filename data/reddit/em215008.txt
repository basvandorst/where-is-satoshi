Thank you

Thank you. Will definitely watch it

I  feel you mate. I think the costs of financial freedom would be the fact the we bear the risk for any fraudulent activity that is inevitable. Without a central authority we have no oversight, nobody but ourselves to blame.

Which ones would you recommend Sir?
@_date: 2019-07-08 20:05:04
Thanks mate ����

Ahh yes. A brilliant piece from Saifedean Ammous . Highly recommend.

 Regulated by the financial regulators of a country of course and then ultimately by global regulators. 
 
With regard to daily adoption, yes btc takes away power from governments because it’s decentralized but then again consumers bear the risk in the event of fraud/ misrepresentation. There’s always a cyber risk as tech advances and hence, there needs to be some form of regulation that provides a remedy to the liability  suffered in these instances. But how does one go about regulating this space when their is no central authority that will be held accountable and I think for this reason, mass adoption will be curtailed.

Just understanding how the protocol works is pretty complex and blockchain is said to be a solution to bank the unbanked. How can we even start to comprehend this when just understanding the technology looks like its the playing field for developers and geeks?

With regard to the stardust reference, I just quoted an opinion of what someone else said and posed the question to understand what exactly it is backed by. I am not against digital assets, I’m just finding it hard to understand it as an alternative means of payment.  
I know that currencies do not have to be backed by anything, and that fiat is not backed by gold but faith people have in their currency/ in some instances, weapons of mass destruction. 
I’m not well versed in what money is but that doesn’t mean I do not have a clue. I’m not expecting anyone to hand me “wisdom”, but I would like to hear the views of experienced individuals whilst I research the area on my own and that is why I ask these questions that make me appear clueless. But innit what reddit is for.

Nowadays, most investments are speculative, nothing new with cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2019-06-17 17:47:28
Thank you for your insightful comments. I do not believe it is bullshit money. I just posed a question and in the description, I quoted what I’ve read as one perception, and this allowed people like yourself to add your view.
Personally, I feel cryptocurrencies are a unique and awesome space in the future of economics. As it is essentially 'value' that is chosen, issued or decided by the people collectively in essence and not any one government. This is true economic liberation. ����

Thanks for the comment. 
Money is cultural, it is something that functions between humans, in a social and political world. Money is imagined, but by being imagined it becomes very real
Simply put, I understand that it is something I can exchange for goods and services. If someone hands me a $100 I will take it because I know that someone else will also accept it.  It’s value requires faith from the masses and it can only have true value as money if it is recognized as a legal tender. 
But just because it’s not a legal tender, doesn’t mean it cannot be used as payment. It means there is no protection for the merchant/consumer. 
People will not readily put their faith into a system where they will  bear the risk in any unfortunate circumstance. We will always want someone to blame. 
And, just understanding the protocol is mind boggling. I did not study economics/mathematics/computer science. I am a law graduate and so my perspective on the matter would be looking at a regulatory framework to understand how it should be regulated without stifling innovation. 
I understand starting from the history of money, and then understanding how the btc protocol works is essential to answering whether btc is money. 
From what I’ve gathered, btc is backed by its code and it’s utility. And, if it stops being useful it would lose its value. It does partially come from what people perceive its value but the utility and the scarcity is the foundational features.

Yes I understand now. Thank you for the thought provoking comments. 
@_date: 2019-06-12 08:57:32
Thank you ������
@_date: 2019-06-17 17:21:18
There’s mass adoption. People are reluctant to use something that they perceive to be speculative.
@_date: 2019-06-12 08:58:06
Thank you ������
@_date: 2019-06-13 07:28:16
Noted. Thank you for your comment. 
Also, in order for money to be effective, it needs to be accepted. And, btc is complicated and unfamiliar and this is a huge barrier to entry as people do not trust that which they do not understand it will will take a generation before it becomes widespread.
@_date: 2019-06-22 12:32:30
I do think to regulate you need to understand the product from all aspects and then adapt it to existing regulations which actually work. Like if i could understand bitcoin and the trading platforms in the same way we understand normal money and assets it’ll be easier to regulate.
@_date: 2019-06-12 20:54:17
Okay thank you for the clarity and the analogy ����
@_date: 2019-06-15 19:52:26
Thank you for your great comment. Crypto is basically internet money and it’s difficult to regulate and control the internet, in fact, it is impossible. 
How do you think regulators should approach this space, what guidelines do you think should be imposed to guide the innovation without crippling it?
@_date: 2019-06-11 21:41:23
Yeah I was told that if I wanted to send a minimal amount of satoshis (as network fee was &gt;than btc t/f), I  should do it via the “lightening network” instead of blockchain transaction (no idea what this means) as  it would’ve reduced the network fee, but the exchange didn’t have the lightening network. 
Also, I was advised to convert btc to an altcoin for lower maker/taker fee but the exchange only offered Ether and it wasn’t worth it.
@_date: 2019-06-12 21:41:55
What am I doing wrong ? When I get this type of economic freedom? I haven’t seen substantial growth from what I’ve invested, well rather not the amount I had hoped for.
@_date: 2019-06-17 17:09:47
Perception. People perceive it to have value and that’s why it is accepted
@_date: 2019-06-12 20:18:01
It does have characteristics as money but no legal tender status except for in Japan.
@_date: 2019-06-12 21:43:46
How does bitcoin help the poor man on the street though? ( I got this question in an interview ) I said it doesn’t.........
@_date: 2019-06-12 19:42:03
So the btc still remains with the exchange I wish to remove the btc from( so kinda like offline storage?) 
And, in this instance I cannot t/f the btc to another exchange once sent to my email address...so no use in sending to my email but rather to the other exchange directly
@_date: 2019-06-11 21:27:02
Okay thanks for letting me know. The option is available from a licensed exchange and there is no fee charged. I was wondering is this is what they called “offline /cold storage”
@_date: 2019-06-13 07:12:40
Existing banking laws in most countries require stricter monitoring and reporting of suspicious transactions to the regulators for  politically exposed persons (PEPs), hence, when looking at a need for a regulatory framework for this space, they would de anonymize crypto in order to combat the associated risks ( money laundering,  financing terrorism..)
@_date: 2019-06-25 20:40:51
Welcome mate ����

So investment asset. And thus it’s more a commodity like gold! 
What about recognizing crypto in general as money, moving away from notes and coins and having a central based cryptocurrency ( in other words money just changing its form) 
Would it really be useless to argue crypto as an alternative means of payment?
