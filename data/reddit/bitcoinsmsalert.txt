Thanks for the info!

Thanks.  Yes, it is true, they will block you if you refresh too often, so this is a much better way in that regard.  Perhaps I will make changes because it's probably a better way to avoid major changes to the program in the future.
The initial idea (and how it differs from BTC Push Monitor) was to detect large fluctuations in % change to price in order to follow trends.  I added the price triggers as an after thought to make it more useful for other people / add functionality. Cheers.

Wow, thanks for sharing mavensbot!  
  I did in fact try BTC Push Monitor, but was never really happy with it.  But if it works for you, great.  As stated in the video, I made this program for me, so it does exactly what I wanted it to do, but feedback / constructive criticism is always welcome.  I'm just happy that a few people have already noticed it, and hopefully some other people can get some use out of it.  Cheers.

  I'm not sure if this answers your question as to why I am doing it this way, but this is to actually see the effect of user defined price changes over a given time, and not to monitor constant changes in price.  That is, I only want to receive texts periodically, and not constantly.  An interval to short may not yield any results, while an interval too far apart may yield too many, or be too delayed.
I don't claim to be a great programmer (all of my degrees are in Economics) so if that doesn't answer your question, or you know a more efficient way to do this, any good resources that I can look at for more info would be greatly appreciated.
