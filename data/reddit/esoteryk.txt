Honestly... I would expect people who are intelligent enough to realize the value of bitcoin to also understand that terrible beer is of no value. If you really want the underground route to a budweiser, just piss in a glass.

This is a huge reason why I like bitcoin as a small business owner. I was doing research for various payment gateways and they basically all say 'there isn't anything you can do'. Even if you specify 'NO REFUNDS' all over the place, the credit companies will withhold money from you and you will be hosed.

This definitely looks like an attempt by AB to bring in "hip" new customers, since they are losing people in swarms.

You MUST be tired. Everyone knows colleges pay for children on a per-pound basis, flat fee pricing would never work.

I wouldn't say most people know about bitcoin anywhere in the world (except SF, since it is so small and tech heavy). My post was definitely a generalization, but I just meant that the newscast seemed really uninformed to me (more so than I would expect from a news source).
Maybe it's just the circles I travel in, but it comes up frequently for me and I don't belong to any bitcoin groups outside of this subreddit. I think it is more or less common knowledge for anyone under 40 at this point, although many of them probably just know about the same "criminal" perception that everyone keeps perpetuating.

You are as uninformed and ignorant as the reporters in this video.

Mah god. That local news. I'm from SD, please know that most people here are pretty savvy about bitcoin.
