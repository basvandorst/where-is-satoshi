While i think the execution is very good, I don't find these icons legible enough. You'd want these to be clear and convey a message even at small scale. I can't see these icons doing that. However, keep improving them. There's definitely potential. I fucking love the "bitcoin address" icon and the "encrypted private key" icon. Love them

Well in this situation it doesn't really matter why people conceptualize some objecs into certain actions. They do and that makes it reasonable for designers to utilize this behavior in icon design. Nobody uses an old telephone receiver when calling someone and, I mean, who uses a magnifying glass when looking for their keys? It's just as you say, these things are widely recognizable, thus people understand what they mean.

That's not relevant. Look at pretty much any GUI. Like 90% of them will use a floppy disk to symbolize the saving process. It's a good choice for an icon.

I would define the word tangible as *something you can touch*, and that is how I used the word in my previous post.

Yeah and what's the problem with that? You aren't describing what you think is wrong with the scenario here, only that it happens. No net loss to society occurs. Nobody is stolen from. Saving isn't evil.
I don't think it's fair to compare hoarding to producing fiat currency.
You need to create value for others by providing goods and services if you want them to give you gold to hoard in the first place. Or you need to mine it for yourself. Regardless you need to put in time and effort to do so, not to mention the risk you take.
A government on the other hand can create an infinite amount of fiat money in the blink of an eye with no effort whatsoever and *without creating value for others*.

This sounds like a great idea! I'm currently a design student and have been working on both front and back-ends of websites pretty much my whole life, send me a PM if you need help with anything!

So what if gold is hoarded and so what if it's in secret?

Switching to litecoin wouldn't be necessary even. If the government destroyed or seized a large amount of BTC the value of the bitcoin would simply rise because of supply and demand (all other things being equal). When the price rises more people are willing to sell and eventually everything balances out.
Ah I love the market, it's so yin and yangy.

Bitcoin can be represented physically, but the data will always remain virtual. The technology behind it can't be something tangible.
And isn't it revolutionary though? We have a new currency with amazing and unique properties and governments all over the world are trying to keep up with this swift paradigm change - but they can't. We are winning and right now there's nothing they can do about it.
This Bitcoin embassy project sounds fantastic! It could be a great way to promote Bitcoin but most importantly it would be a terrific place to promote discussion and creativity within the Bitcoin community. Just imagine what great new ideas and software could come of it!

I'm a soon-to-be beekeeper hoping to sell some honey in the future. Bitcoin is pretty new to me but I will definitely accept bitcoins. This is really great!
