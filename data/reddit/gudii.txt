I created a wallet using Electrum about 10 days ago and the adressses generated by it started with "3" which would make them P2SH and segwit enabled (Isnt it? ) then i proceeded to recieve a small tx and left it there until i needed to use it. 
Then yesterday that day came where i had to send 1 mtbc, yet the fees were over the 3's mtbc , What am i doing wrong? isnt it segwit supposed to help with these huge fees?

noob question, whats the last thing he applied on top of the coins? (the thing that makes it look like they're under glass)

Because of the previous post i downloaded and installed the electrum desktop version, Even though it looks simple its yet confusing to me (I used blockchain info previously) ... I was given like 10 addresses in electrum, are they all good to use and how do i make new ones?  and more importantly how do i even know they're segwit addresses?

Venezuela doesnt even print our own currency.  We depend on european countries to do it (Germany i believe)  thats why besides the big inflation we also have a MASSIVE lack of cash in the country. 
Everyday there's lines of 20+ people at ATM's just trying to find cash which at the same time is limited to about 10-20k a day (bolivares) which is not even 1$..  So even if you manage to find cash today the ammount is so worthless that you gotta do it again tomorrow.

Could you elaborate on this topic, Everytime i hear someone saying anything about wallets its all focused on having the private keys,  And with blockchain.info i know i got my keys. 
Yet on the bitcoincash fork i didn't get access to both coins at the time (I didnt even have money so doesnt matter, i didnt understood forks at the time so i just dodged the problem and came back after the dust settled) 
but had i kept my bitcoin on blockchain.info then it would of been fine since they were supporting bitcoin normal/core 
This time they're supporting 2x so for what i understand is that whatever ammount i have will change from bitcoin to  b2x, regardless if i have my own keys, so... what happens to my bitcoin then?
