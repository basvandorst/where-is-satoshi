There was an opportunity to keep the community together.

It was a very high volume day, it appears as though one investor bought a large tranche of coins - its enough to pop the price up in the bitcoin world.

"legacy chain can remain technically" Why is it being referred to as the legacy chain by you and the likes of Bitcoin Magazine?    Its BIP148 that is forking here from the main chain.

It does actually thanks, because it is misleading

I would say if BIP148 fails its a great thing.  It will mean we have Segwit activation at 80% support (lower than 95%) - if Segwit is worthy and needed by the Bitcoin community it will get the support it needs to activate.  With Segwit2x We will also get larger blocks soon improving scalability, and reducing the need for segwit anyway.  Blocks wont be so full and fees will be cheaper.

I appreciate your honesty and thorough rebuttal of my simple perspective.

Or I just didnt reply to the parent comment!

Support is low for BIP148

Why stop at Roger Ver? Wouldnt you want to zero out anyone that you dont like who hasn't bent to your will?

Shouldnt we also be aiming to spend a certain amount of BTC per year on stuff to encourage its adoption by merchants?
