Sorry.. I'm barely here. Just saw. It's a generic platform to rent hardware. PaaS. BTW now it's  due to a letter from Citrix as published on

nothing like Ethereum at all. not even close
@_date: 2014-11-13 03:07:26
on ethereum, you cannot fold proteins. it's just too slow. and not because of the language, it's minor to the fact that on ethereum all computers run exactly the same code! it's not intended for massive computations.
on zennet, one can rent as much computers as they want, and run over them whatever they want. like out-of-the-box distributed apps such as apache hadoop, gromacs etc.
as you said, the decentralization is zennet is of the market itself. wheter to run over it a decentralized app or not - that's up to the user's. it's 100% flexible. you just get computers with linux. just like AWS

no, for tech reasons

BTW  will do most of them much more efficiently

how do you identify scam? tell me your non-working algo
@_date: 2014-11-19 12:00:12
cant do it with Bitcoin 
@_date: 2014-11-14 02:04:31
no, i'm saying it's a totally different product with entirely different goals, functions, uses and market. not more, not less - different.

how do you know satoshi didnt have funding?
besides, that's a much more complicated system, and costly to implement
@_date: 2014-11-19 13:22:32
ok, tell how to do this project without funding

read some about Totally Functional Programming Languages (which is same as saying dependently typed lambda calculus)

turing machine can do more than a computer can do. it allows infinite tape.

the mathematics indeed deserve a nobel prize, but was not invented by tau dev, it's been around a couple of decades.
@_date: 2015-07-16 20:14:23
not for tau itself but for financial apps over tau namely Agoras as described in idni.org
@_date: 2015-08-14 15:46:52
and I dont, ofc! thats why Turing machine is more than what real computers can do.

from 
"Tauchain is designed to be the fairest system on earth: the users set the rules(=programs=networks, e.g. a currency). It is not an easy task! Look close into it, and you'll find one big chicken-egg problem. Far to mention, on tauchain itself there's no sale, no premine, not even coin. Tauchain's development isn't actually funded, and tauchain will give no preferences to devs whatsoever, as under pure decentralization philosophy. Surely, if the users decide to give more power to one or more entities, it's their decision, since they literally determine all rules. But when tauchain first goes on air -- all participants are inherently equal. If you find how to make tauchain even more fair - welcome to the very questions we ask ourselves, and please tell us your opinion."
@_date: 2015-07-16 20:35:08
very much differences.
about bitcoin/sidechains, the chain is able to verify a single kind of proof: private/public key. here, proofs can be anything, at the sense of logical proof. on github there's already working tau automated theorem prover.
about ethereum, even more to tell, but to mention two points: on tau, the chain is the client's code itself. on etherum, the client is somehow fixed (not to mention the unbearable feature of etheruem that all nodes perform same job). another difference is turing completeness: etherum being turing complete disables exactly the strong abilities of tau, which is provability, and all about decidability.
