Oh boy, you do need to read the Sacred Economics (Charles Eisenstein author) before ever uttering something like that. 
It is available online for free if you don't want to buy a book. No excuses.

Same here MrsFlip. These kids just don't know the ways of the world ;-)
Maybe we start out own sub,  mixing recipes and gardening tips with crypto talk?

"35-50 year old women. I can't see them jumping onto a bittrex, bitstamp, coinbase, or binance and executing trades and then transferring those trades to a ledger wallet or myetherwallet...."
And yet ...  I am that very demographic ... I have been doing just that for a while now. Need to stop and get back to recipe sharing sites? Shake off you stereotypes young man! 
Joking aside i know i am an outlier, but for crypto to get mainstream wide adoption it will need to get very uncool in the process. You just cannot have both.
It will break many cool needs' hearts but that is the price od adoption, sorry to break this to you kids.
