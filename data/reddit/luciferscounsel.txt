No, they can use the card to digitally trade a real currency.
You're not going to try and criticise *that* are you?
@_date: 2014-03-05 16:56:48
*If* bitcoin survives this period, it will be by becoming exactly like any other currency that is actually worth holding.

Hey, I use paper currency like most sane people. But let's say the world ends tomorrow, and we're all living in Zombieland.
Silver has more uses than *just* being a trade-able currency. It's a good antiseptic, for a start. It has real intrinsic value, which is why it became a trade-able commodity in the first place.
@_date: 2014-03-05 18:02:04
How much did it cost you to set up that "cold storage"?
My wallet cost ten bucks.
@_date: 2014-03-05 17:47:50
Hehe... yeah bitcoin is a joke all right.
@_date: 2014-03-05 16:57:36
Just hope the power doesn't go out.
How are you going to buy candles with a digital currency?
@_date: 2014-03-05 16:59:49


Yeah, but I bet this subreddit was singing its praises.
@_date: 2014-03-05 16:32:26


Huh? Isn't that the very opposite of what Bitcoin is meant to be?
@_date: 2014-03-05 16:56:02


Don't fool yourself, so are they.
@_date: 2014-03-05 17:23:19
My wallet is still in my pocket, and all the easily spent cash in it is as safe as it could possibly be.
You can't DDOS my "exchange"...
@_date: 2014-03-05 17:35:48
Speak for yourself, pauper.
But seriously... they can if they want, and be perfectly safe.
No fucking geek with a keyboard is going to get his hands on it.
@_date: 2014-03-05 17:34:16
My wallet fits in my pocket. It contains currency that can be spent in any shop in the country, handed to friends, even traded for currency that can be used in foreign countries.
You have to actually put your hand in my pocket, to get my wallet.
It's far easier, and far safer than any fucking bitcoin system.
@_date: 2014-03-05 16:41:19
Except... a BTC is only worth what someone will pay for it, and at this point, you'd be mad to pay a cent for a few 1's and 0's that have no intrinsic value and are not backed by any government.
So you might have lost a bunch of 1's and 0's but the only money you lost was the money you used to buy those 1's and 0's.
@_date: 2014-03-05 17:59:36
I bet he's already had it:


@_date: 2014-03-05 17:50:29
How much money have you spent "earning" and "securing" your money?
My wallet is 30 years old and still works perfectly. As secure as the day I bought it.
I don't have to upgrade constantly to stay ahead of the hackers. I don't have to worry about unpatched 0-day exploits.
The oldest security measure in the world still works. You try to take my wallet, I kick your fucking head in.
@_date: 2014-03-05 16:38:36
I'm sorry, but your tears are meaningless to me.
You were stupid enough to trust the internet. You get what you deserve.
@_date: 2014-03-05 16:54:01
I bet most of the MtGox suckers were saying the same thing, the day before they lost it all.
@_date: 2014-03-05 17:31:17
Can we stop calling this dork a CEO:
I wouldn't trust that guy with the beer money, let alone my life savings.
@_date: 2014-03-05 17:24:09
But every time a theft occurs, you lose money.
Each time the price drops because some criminals ripped off bitcoin users, every bitcoin holder loses a little bit of the money they thought they had.
@_date: 2014-03-05 16:36:26
Well, you weren't very smart, were you?
What kind of fool puts all their cash into an untraceable currency on "exhcanges" run by guys like this:
[MtGox CEO Mark Karpeles](
*That* is the kind of guy you're going to trust your money with?
@_date: 2014-03-05 16:29:19
Now that is a face you can trust.
That unkempt hair, that smirk. Laughing all the way to the bank.
@_date: 2014-03-05 16:46:51
Beaten to death for giving people exactly what they wanted?
If you buy an untraceable "currency" that has no intrinsic value, and has no legal protections, you have to expect the criminal element to be intimately involved.
Do business with criminals; expect to get burned.
@_date: 2014-03-05 16:50:56
Cry me a river.
You bought into this whole scam because you thought you were going to get rich.
Sucks to be as stupid as you.
@_date: 2014-03-05 17:44:21


That's the problem. By design, it will *never* be as easy and safe to use. That's what happens when you make it an untraceable currency with no intrinsic value.
You are at the mercy of the market, and have to take special precautions that you do not have to take with any other currency.
If your US dollars burn in a fire, and you can recover enough of the ashes to make out the serial numbers, you can get your money back.








See how much better **real money** is?
What happens if you e-wallet becomes corrupted? You are hosed. No one is going to replace your "mutilated currency". Try recovering *any* bitcoins from the ashes of a fire.
@_date: 2014-03-05 16:52:31
All cons work the same way - by preying on the greed of stupid people.
You got greedy, but were too stupid to realise the people you trusted were even greedier.
Cry me a river.
@_date: 2014-03-05 17:58:44
Hey... how'd you get on with BTC-E... I read in your history that you had an issue with them that they seemed uninterested in resolving...
@_date: 2014-03-05 16:54:58


Except if someone steals my credit card, I do not lose one cent.
@_date: 2014-03-05 17:21:44
How did you get on with that [problem]( you had with BTC-E?
I note you later said:


So can I assume it didn't go well?
@_date: 2014-03-05 16:49:35


Now you have.
The people that got into Bitcoin fall into two categories. Those who bought bitcoin because it is an untraceable currency so they feel safer performing criminal transactions (such as drug buys) using them...
...and the people that heard about how much money they could make simply by buying a few bitcoins from the drug dealers that had them to begin with.
Fools. You basically became money launderers. Now you're crying about getting "ripped off" by the criminals doing the laundering.
@_date: 2014-03-05 17:12:19


He's probably another less successful scammer.
But then, there is this:


@_date: 2014-03-05 17:26:03
Heh... my money is safer in my pocket than in any digital format. Exchanges flee with the cash, banks fail. But the cash in my pocket can be spent as long as the government recognises it as legal tender.
Even if the power goes off.
@_date: 2014-03-05 18:01:16
How did they steal it?
@_date: 2014-03-05 16:59:07
Yeah... but what is the point of that?
Isn't a currency meant to be spent?
@_date: 2014-03-05 17:39:33


But that is the point. I don't need to be educated to figure out how to stop someone putting their hand in my pocket.
@_date: 2014-03-05 17:38:36


Cash money... does it have your name printed on it? Didn't think so.
Oh and if someone gets your CC info, you file a fraud claim and lose not one single cent.
@_date: 2014-03-05 18:03:10
Paper wallet... is that anything like paper money? Can you spend it anywhere?
@_date: 2014-03-05 17:27:49
And on that day gold, or even US dollars, will still be trade-able. But if your computer can't boot up and the bank is closed, and you were relying on them to keep your money safe, you're screwed.
Nothing beats cold hard legal tender in your pocket.
@_date: 2014-03-05 18:08:42
Yeah man... its awesome. Works in any shop. You can even just hand it to people on the street.
[If it gets damaged you can have it replaced.](
If you put it in a bank, not only is the bank protecting it and promising to pay it back to you even if their vaults get raided by robbers, but if the bank itself fails, the **government** will pay you back!
How awesome is that!
Paper money is the *killer app* of the past *and* future.
@_date: 2014-03-05 18:04:25
My bitcoin *was* stolen.
My bitcoins *were* stolen.
See the difference?
