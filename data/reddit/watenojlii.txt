You are starting a business on uncharted territory and you are worried about copyright on symbols that are usually just letters from different alphabets?

My experience is that USD transfers in the EU receive a little more scrutiny, since it is unusual for the average person to have them.
4 days is touching the time where I'd start to worry too, worry that they'll take a long time to do it. But I still trust they will eventually pay out your money. Best of luck.

You can generate and print a paper wallet completely offline, and you can generate multiple copies so they can survive a fire. There is no difficulty in creating them at all. A hardware wallet is not fire proof either.
Hardware wallets are just a showoff.

There have been accounts, IDs, and all kinds of things for sale for a while now. Specially whitelists entries for ICOs. It's a big business.

I couldn't understand what you actually did, but I believe withdrawals of fiat have less issues right now than deposits or KYC verifications.
I made a SEPA withdrawal 2 days ago and received it yesterday.
Edit: Also avoid depositing or withdrawing a lot of money at once since that probably means they have to manually check something for AML reasons.

Now's a good time, I think it will fall further but you can't time the market. Just don't panic sell.

Mistertango is not a bank and money held there is not insured by the EU central bank.
@_date: 2018-01-28 17:34:29
Because they may be using it on an exchange without USD, and can only cash out by transferring coins to a bitstamp/kraken/etc with fiat pairs.

Another option is guerrilla/terrorism. Killing important people's family. Bombing govmt buildings, etc. It has worked before.

I didn't say I trust them, I just said keeping a paper trail was not a bad thing, imo.

We don't even know the real big news that must have scared big money, yet, it will go much lower still.

What world do you live in where anyone trusts tether/bitfinex?
We're just on borrowed time until it is closed down and the market crashes.
@_date: 2018-01-09 11:34:59
If they try to cash out any significant amount the market would dip, and they would lose out on a lot of money. So the intelligent thing to do is to cash out very slowly.
But since they are young why would they even want to cashout at all, bar the expenses they actually incurr in their millionaire life style.
@_date: 2018-01-31 06:59:18
I don't know about dip. A dip to me is a normal market correction. I am pretty certain we'll get more information on this tether business soon and I have no idea if it's good or bad news. Until then, the pessimism will remain for a while.

And what does it matter to you whether he's sane or not. Shouldn't that investment go into understanding whether his message is true or not?
The whole Tether/bitfinex issue smell like a timebomb about to blow up, just like bitconnect, with everyone saying the morning after "I told you so".
@_date: 2018-01-24 17:17:49
We don't need proof. We need sensible feedback. There is also no proof that bitconnect is a scam and never was, are you gonna buy BCC now, you fucking idiot?
Edit: in reply to the wrong person, don't be offended

No, there is better tech out there

Never use coinbase. There should be a banner for this.

It's really hard to break the psychological barrier of the 10k, so the market rebounds there.
@_date: 2018-01-28 14:10:23
The USD value of coins would first rise, but the consequence of a sell-off in USDT is that people would want to cash out to USD instead, or move their coins to an exchange with fiat pairs. Since there isn't enough fiat for it to maintain that price, the coin value would then plummet when trying to convert to fiat.

Hardware wallets are a very dumb idea. The most likely result will be losing everything stored in it because of some driver issue, hardware failure, forgetting a password, misplacing the damn thing...
If you plan on hodling, just print multiple copies of a paper wallet.

Well, at a quick glance, they can declare bankruptcy and your money is lost. They do not have proper support, their website just says to send them an email, or an email to their CEO. Plus, a website that advertises itself as providing an European IBAN? Why wouldn't the IBAN be European if the company is European? It suggests they facilitate people that are not European to get an European IBAN, which is shady because they could also open an account in a more traditional bank.

A payment system provider does not have the same obligations as a real bank. The EU will not insure or rescue Paypal or Stripe.
From another reply:


Then it is definitely not a bank. The account is not in your name.

Why would that be a reason not to use Kraken? I hope every company that deals with my money keeps a damn good and unmovable paper trail.

Where are you reading that information? fork.lol shows a 101.10 Sats/Byte 24h average fee.

AFAIK bitcoin usually dips less than other coins, so you might as well just have your money in bitcoin. Tether of course dips even less than BTC, until it doesn't; and when it doesn't it isn't coming back.
@_date: 2018-01-28 13:59:19
I don't think there are many institutions at all investing in Bitcoin, and the few that are are probably going through investment companies and never actually see their bitcoin. They are probably insured too, and whoever has the bitcoins has them is cold storage in a hard to get to place. They were probably bought directly to great bitcoin owners or through dark pools after having made personal relationships with an exchange owners.

He says he found a bug and received 10 BTC because of it? His address never had 10 BTC in it.

That's a really poor argument. On very large projects you can always find worthwhile things to ~~steal~~copy.
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:07:17
What you're forgetting is that bitcoin has a past record, you could have bought it 10 years ago and it would still be valid, there were no debasement, eths locked in faulty contracts, hard forks that killed the main chain, hacks. Also, bitcoin at this point is kinda like a brand, to the average person you deal in bitcoin, no matter what crypto currency you actually hold.
I don't know anything about being "chosen in the future" because honestly all this sounds like bull, but bitcoin is the most stable coin and that's a good thing imo.

You use a mixer or create your own mixer, and withdraw small amounts obviously.
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:35:17
Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be much alternative. Maybe localbitcoins?
I live in a country where just having your ID and a few things can't be used against me, but I still use a separate setup to at least prevent being hacked myself.

They forked it, so they clearly admit it is better than starting over.
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:20:06
Your btc hasn't dropped but it's value as store of value has. 
A store of value has to be near constant value, something that is always going up will attract people interested in speculation, and nothing can always go up so there will also be crashes; because of both of these using something that is raising in value now is a terrible store of value option. It's, instead, an investment.

Also, leave your bitcoins on your own wallet and be hacked, forget it, etc

And he's right. Most coins will go nowhere, which is not saying a lot since there are tens of thousands of them already.

It already is, you just have to buy real estate valued over a certain amount in Portugal to get Portuguese (EU) citizenship; this is called here "golden visas". And there are sellers that accept crypto.

If those coins move it is a sign that the quantum computers are here and bitcoin must be abandoned immediately. It would drop to 5%.

He hasn't formatted the drive, but that doesn't mean it wasn't accidentally deleted, no?
Anyways, searching every sector in the drive for a sequence of 7 bytes? Plus it may be split in two sectors, I suppose. It sounds painful. Best of luck.

You should never have a bank account connected to a payments provider directly; and it is a good idea to use a different bank for crypto. There are several banks that block crypto and even if yours doesn't it may still block the account for AML investigation.
