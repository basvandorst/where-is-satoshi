Just an anomaly, nothing to get excited about

I can make bitcoins from playing TF2?
Sign me up.

We go down to ~$4.1x, then we shoot up and never look back.
Just my prediction.

1) Because the "real" money (AKA fiat money, which is a hell of a lot less "real" than bitcoin) is collapsing.
2) Essentially, you get GPUs to guess a really big number, and whoever guesses the number first wins bitcoins. It's more complicated than that, but it keeps production constant and makes it harder to attack the network, or hoard every bitcoin from the beginning.
3) More use, greater spread of knowledge about bitcoin, and a further distrust in government issued money.

This should help you out. You can use Mt.Gox, but I think that Intersango is better for UK customers, but I wouldn't know. Either would be fine.

I'm having a ton of difficulty understanding this. Can someone break it down for me? How many BTC is a Strange Backburner worth?

Duly noted, thank you for your off-topic and snide comment.
@_date: 2012-03-28 17:33:42
Agreed. This is wrong, and a betrayal of trust.

Bitcoinclassifieds has a rating system that I think is better than BitMit's.

Well, it depends. Do you trust your computer security, or the security of the online wallet?
But it can't hurt to go with both. It's never a good idea to put all your eggs in one basket.

This. Is. GLORIOUS. 
The state of the world fiat economy is tragic, especially in Greece. But at the end of all this, we'll see some real change for the better.

Merry Bitmas to you!

Check out my [video guide]( it should answer your questions.

Yes, necessarily. An economy does not grow from hoarding.

This is where I stop debating and ask for a source for such a claim.


It does matter, but I understand what you're trying to say. You're right, it's mostly the quality of trade that grows an economy. More specifically, any action that adds value to the economy will increase growth.
Now to apply that to the topic at hand: the people who invested in the startups believe that in the future, these startups will add value to the economy by providing goods and services. Whether or not they actually do add value depends on if the startup is a success, and that is made more likely by the initial capital gained from the investors.

As is yours. 
I never claimed that my statements were certainly correct, I merely contributed my thoughts. I come here to discuss and learn, not to argue or teach. The claims you've made are unclear to me (to put it nicely), which is why I asked for a source. If you want to debate this further when it's convenient for you, I'd be delighted; but as it stands, you have not contributed to meaningful discussion.

Why not decibitcoins? 1 BTC = 0.1 dBTC
"DeciBit" rolls off the tounge quite nicely, and it fits better for lower value transactions. Sometime in the future, one might say "I paid about two decibits for that game on Steam."

Nobody has time to give you an economics lesson, but gaining a little knowledge on your own will answer your question.
In short, an economy is a system of trade. More trade of goods and services means all parties involved are better off; i.e., the economy grows. The more BTC that lie dormant in wallets, the less opportunity there is for trade, and thus less opportunity for growth.
