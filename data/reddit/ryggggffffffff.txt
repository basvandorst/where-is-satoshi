It is a pyramid scheme until the moment it proves to have usecase. So they are right. But they could be wrong in the future. Atm, they are right. Also, big difference between BLOCKCHAIN and BTC. BTC seems to be the next Altavista at the moment. Totally useless.

No, by your logic, France would have had an extremely volatile Franc, because they had the same amount of users as btc now (40 million). It doesn't make sense whatsoever. The amount of holders has hugely multiplied these past 10 years, volatility is the same. Your logic is a flawed logic.
@_date: 2019-01-11 01:11:32
Of course you smile hard. You're not smiling as a business which loses 20 percent of its profits when using btc. That's why almost nobody uses the shitcoin anymore. It's truly a shitcoin, even compared to other coins. Value is gonna drop and drop and drop. You got out on time.

The Bitcoin fallacy: 'I expect others to use it as a payment method but I'm not going to use it as a payment method, I only speculate'.  coin.
@_date: 2019-01-10 22:57:48
Because there is a big gap between the business people in crypto and real demand from society. Crypto is driven by idealists, not by real businessmen. The coin is failing to be adopted and as a payment method. In every other market, they would have said: okay, move on to something better. Not with btc. They keep building failing projects around btc instead of being driven by what people really want. People want stable coins, something you can trust, regulation, they want middlemen that offer a service, and they want at least some level of centralization.

According to research Bitcoin whales are pulling their money out of btc these last 40 days (over the counter).
@_date: 2019-01-11 00:49:03
These shares represent a value without having to be spend. Btc represents no value when it's not spend. It only has true value as a payment method, cause it has no underlying value like a security token. People are losing confidence in btc. More than a decade down the line and still no usecase. It's time to say goodbye. 
@_date: 2019-01-12 13:41:32
It's slowly bleeding to death due to lack of usecase. It doesn't do it's job as a payment, neither is it a store of value, both due to high volatility. It's being mocked all over the internet for being worth nothing. Blockchain will survive, crypto will survive, but long gone are the days of btc. It has done its duty as a promotor of crypto, but it  plays a negative role now. 
@_date: 2019-01-12 20:38:11
Uhmmm... Maybe because some coins are stable coins and suited for payments and btc not, some are security tokens with underlying value (which btc doesn't have), so they are better suited as a store of value, and some have a two-coin system like binance and power ledger, which leads to higher utility, so better suited as speculative assets as well. Just to name a few. You need to get your head out of btc's ass. The only one that's repeating the same thing is you, without any substance, it's just brainwashed same sentences.
@_date: 2019-01-12 18:45:12
You are contradicting yourself. First you say it will be a payment method, then you say the speculation will never go away. See, that's the fundemental problem. It cannot be a speculative asset ánd a payment method. You see the fallacy now, why it will and cannot be adopted by the mass? Btc has reached its limits as a speculative asset. This is it. The fact that there is an industry built around it, doesn't matter. Once people realize it doesn't make them enough or more money, they pack their shit and go to another coin or market. It's that easy. There are more coins and more markets.

Gold is NOT suited as a currency in modern age. You need to be able to lend money in current economies, lots of money, to businesses and private persons, to make economies grow. This is not possible if you have a currency or asset with fixed supply, like gold or btc. Sometimes it's like people on this board are living on the moon. They don't have a single clue of how and why systems work.
@_date: 2019-01-12 18:58:52
So you are one of the few who gets it and everyone else is stupid? You're a genius.

Gold has an underlying value. People make jewelry, wedding rings, decorations etc. Gold is also used in industries all over the world because of lack of corosion. Btc doesn't have an underlying value. Gold is also not suitable as a currency. Btc neither because of fixed supply. So what's left for btc? Not so much. It's neither a reliable store of value because of high speculation and volatility. So as much as people want btc to succeed, it seems it doesn't have much future. It has a past where it attracted people into crypto because of brandname, but the future is looking very bad for btc. People are pulling their money out cause it has completely failed to have a usecase and underlying value. 
@_date: 2019-01-14 03:25:02
The real world example is that btc isn't used as a payment method. 10 years in and still no solid usecase as a payment method.

Why is this company anouncing dates all the time and then delaying the dates? Very amateurish. 
@_date: 2019-01-11 00:40:17
Your reasoning neglects the fact that bitcoin has a fixed 21 million coin maximum supply with an ever growing number of lost coins &gt; 
and that's why it cannot be a payment method, due to this fixed supply. It has nothing to do with the amount of people buying it. Do you understand this logic or do you want to repeat the same thing over and over again?
@_date: 2019-01-12 17:13:38
Like I said, people associate blockchain with btc because of brandname. But this will diminish over time. Btc is not blockchain, it's just btc. Many things btc does, can be done by other coins way better. Btc might become a collector's item, for the niche, but it's absolutely not suited for mass adoption. That train has passed. The mass doesn't want it, and demand drives the market and price.
@_date: 2019-01-11 00:45:49
There are much better coins that are way better suited to fit that role. Btc is an old outdated coin. It really has no place in this new digital area. It was okay ten years ago, but it's holding everything up now, consuming too much energy, nobody uses it, very slow. We don't need it anymore.
@_date: 2019-01-12 09:42:05
You made the right decision. You have to invest at the right time at the right place. Bitcoin had its days. Don't see it grow much further. You need adoption for that and adoption is already very high now, considering the fact it's not a payment method but a speculative asset. It's also an 'old' technology and consuming too much energy. It's like the big computers in the 60s. It will be surpassed by a better idea/coin and the cryptomarket will change over time. Long gone are the times of icos and mass hysteria.

Because you need volatile moneysupply to keep an economy running. You need people and businesses to be able to borrow money, lots of money. Having gold or btc as a currency will mean the economy will shrink to a substantial degree. And yes, these debts could become a problem, but as long as people are working, businesses are making products and offering services, countries keep trading with eachother and national product increases, there's not much going on. This doesn't mean crypto with a fixed supply are completely worthless. They could serve as an addition to currency with volatile supply, and as a form of protection against crisis, like gold. But you can't build an economy based on a coin with fixed supply. It could potential be build upon a crypto with volatile supply, but this will not be completely decentralized, and that's something people within the cryptocommunity just have to except. You can't have maximum liberty without somekind of trade-off.
@_date: 2019-01-13 03:17:19
Is this a real question? You think a country is going to back its currency with a highly volatile coin with fixed supply? This will kill their economy. I mean, there is insanity and there is the superlative degree of insanity, I don't know how you call it.

Btc will become a niche coin, a collector's item. It's very unpractical, it's like the first prototype of a car. We have far better and faster coins now, and there will be more and better suited coins for payments. 
@_date: 2019-01-12 01:54:47
Nobody says blockchain is useless. That is the tech, not btc. People use btc when they should use blockchain. Btc could be the next Altavista, but blockchain will survive, like the internet.
@_date: 2019-01-12 19:23:59
Btc is like a car with square wheels. It looks great, it has flashy colors. There's only 'a small' problem. It has square wheels, it doesn't ride. So nobody can use it. Nobody uses btc, everyone's buying a car with square wheels. 
@_date: 2019-01-10 22:15:49
Why are you hoping for etf's to speculate even more, while you could give the right example by spending your btc to buy stuff. 
@_date: 2019-01-14 01:53:17
It's clear the system doesn't work quite how it's supposed to work and with the goal of being a payment method. It became a gambling coin. That's okay when you have mass hysteria, you'll make money. But now that the hype is gone, not much intrinsic value is left.

Why do you react extremely emotional and agressive all the time to anyone that opposes your views? It's almost as if you're not an investor that needs to keep his emotions in check in order to make the best decisions, but a brainwashed religious person. Keep your emotions in check, it's just an investment, not your child. If it succeeds, it succeeds. If it doesn't, you better get out on time. That's how investment works. You think Wallstreet investors are emotionally attached to a stock? Of course not, they need to stay calm. 
@_date: 2019-01-10 21:15:10
There is no 'phase' or that kind of shit. Bitcoin in 2019 is a whole other thing than btc in 2015. It's about adoption now, and that doesn't look good.

Btc as well as other coins have the same problem: huge lack of usecase. Every coin is in the same boat.

The tech is blockchain. Everyone who knows the tech believes in it, even Roubini. Btc is not the tech, it's just another coin, and its popularity is purely based on brandname. For people who firmly believe in btc it doesn't matter that it doesn't have a usecase. For the majority of people, it does matter. They don't see any usecase in it (store of value/payment method) and other roles/functions could be done by other coins way better.
@_date: 2019-01-12 18:03:07
What is proven wrong? That it has no usecase as a payment method and the mass doesn't want it? These are facts for over 10 years, not opinions.
@_date: 2019-01-10 23:07:13
Of course. Nobody spends this shitcoin, but when you ask this question to btc fans, all of a sudden they are spenders. I call BS. 
"We don't have enough users" &gt; Because more than 40 million users, almost the size of France, is not enough to stabilize a coin.
Please cut this crap, the amount of holders has nothing to do with how stable a coin is. It all has to do with a centralized system where a bank controls the inflation with a volatile supply. Volatile supply is an extremely important factor. "But but government bad, central bank bad, inflation bad, everything bad" says the libertarian clown, who doesn't know a single thing about a working, functional system.

Only if btc survives, but that's a big 'if' at the moment. Still no real usecase and it has first mover disadvantage due to old technology.

Iran and Venezuela buying btc adds almost nothing to the price. They will need a huge amount of their currency to buy 1 btc.
