Hey Canadians,
If you want to try this too you can reload any existing Visa credit card using Bitcoin, no accounts and SpendBT.com's homepage.
Good buy OP!

Woah - where did mobbr.com come from? This is really cool. We still have to trust them with payouts and potentially unclaimed payouts (?).

Please add this to list above.

If you're in Canada you can use your Visa card and use  to pay it off using Bitcoin.

All voters must still go to a polling station and present ID or a voting card, as they do today.
The difference begins with how you place your vote and how it's counted. I suppose if somebody wanted to be identified they could make a social media post of their TX. Otherwise nobody will know who you are on the network, just that you were able to satisfy polling station staff enough to get a prequalified paper wallet ballot from them.

 &gt;To enable Bitcoin in Stripe Checkout, simply add the data-bitcoin="true" option when constructing your checkout form, as follows:
&lt;form action="/create_payment" method="POST"&gt;
  
    src=" class="stripe-button"
    data-key=pk_test_6pRNASCoBOKtIshFeQd4XMUh

Great work guys! This should help clear up misinformation and gives Bitcoin companies a standard they can be proud to adhere to (unlike some legacy standards/buzz words). 
@_date: 2015-02-15 20:44:16
This is why SpendBT.com holds no customer funds, and our web apps contain no private keys (for wallets or db encryption).

Hi there,
We'd love to add them all - as soon as we find a processor to do this for us, we'll have them added that week.
If anyone can point us in the right direction, shoot us a PM or email us at help

Hi there,
This works too! All Visa Debit cards are supported.
Let me know if you have any other questions,

@_date: 2015-02-07 15:49:02
The fiat system never ceases to impress me.... Thanks for this info.
@_date: 2015-02-10 15:35:24
Nice! Like SpendBT.com where Visa is the destination. 
I wonder where else could be the fiat destination? Facebook $? Snapchat $? Western Union $? A Bitcoin transaction is not just money, it's existence can also imply instructions.
@_date: 2015-02-09 01:51:50
Hi there,
PM us (or email help the first six digits of the card - it's the bank identifier (all cards of that type start with the same six) - and we can tell you. Payments will be made in CAD and the local Japanese bank will convert it (USD is available too, but we haven't implemented it just yet).

Hi there,
Sorry for the confusion but we've always encrypted credit card numbers and this was exaggerated way beyond our words - please see our reddit history or our website for clarification.
SpendBT Team
@_date: 2015-02-20 00:54:39
Funny how they do that :)
@_date: 2015-02-07 14:05:05
Hi there,
Great question! We handle the credit card number like a Bitcoin address. For SpendBT we store the number ~~in plain text~~ offline encrypted for 30 days, then truncate all records older than 30 days to the last four digits.
You cannot, under any merchant system we've ever seen, place a credit card charge with solely the number. You always need at least the expiry to match. Just like you cannot make a Bitcoin transaction with just the public key.
When you actually are generated a QR code, the site warns "Use each QR code only once".
We may in the future allow a permanent address we monitor and top up in perpetuity, thanks for the feedback!
SpendBT Team
Edit: Thanks for your feedback! We hoped to make things simple by keeping card numbers in effectively plain text (standard encryption, *but we can decrypt*, off our public web server, of course). This compares to QuickBT, where we have no access and never see your personal financial details (*we can't decrypt*). As of now we've implemented a stronger encryption of all card numbers just in case (still offline). Our customers are demanding PCI DSS level compliance and we will deliver so we can make that claim. We'll update reddit when we're PCI DSS compliant, and hold our official Monday launch until then. 
This is what the feedback weekend is for! We find things like this, solve them with you folks and grow.
@_date: 2015-02-07 14:07:59
Hi there,
SpendBT is marketed to Canadians! I do apologize for the inconvenience. Our credit card payment system theoretically can pay any credit card in the world, but we don't guarantee any beyond Canada as we haven't tested them yet.
SpendBT Team
@_date: 2015-02-07 08:24:03
Thanks for the feedback! We'll build our contact/about sections out to make customers feel more comfortable.
Thanks again,

@_date: 2015-02-07 14:24:59
Hi there,
Valid concern and we hear you! Working on this for launch!
To make you feel (a bit) better, a credit card number alone is like a Bitcoin address, you can make payments to it but not from it. You need at least the expiry, secret code etc to place charges.
Thanks for your feedback though I know how you feel,
SpendBT Team
@_date: 2015-02-07 21:34:37
Thanks for your feedback!

Hi there,
Honestly, we don't know yet! Like Circle, we're just launching with this ability and haven't tested global cards. We've tested Canada, so we guarantee Canada. Once we've done more detailed testing and legal legwork, we'll provide updates here!

Use 4111111111111111 and send some dust to the address if you like. This will give you an idea of what our service is like. We're working on a walkthrough video too!
Thanks for your comments though, it's a valuable point we need to conquer,
SpendBT Team
Edit: Test cards disabled as we are now live.
@_date: 2015-02-10 20:32:38
This is epic news.
@_date: 2015-02-07 15:57:41
I suspect by the end of this feedback weekend, and before we launch, this will be solved. Edit: Referring PCI Compliance status - card numbers always encrypted online, but our company can decrypt to plain text and will always be able to (which is something we want people to consider).
We totally understand the need for PCI Compliance, but hoped that a card number (primary account number) alone (no expiry, cvc, address, name etc etc) would render the data as valuable as a Public Key. Edit: The consumer demand for PCI compliance status - our practices themselves supersede the spec.
From the comments here, Visa is still allowing charges to go through with just a PAN and an estimated expiry :(
Thanks for the feedback this is what we wanted so keep it coming!

Just summarizing what we see. Looks to me like you can either implement their hosted checkout with just the extra tag, or if you're using your own ui, they have a library which is more complex.

Hi there,
Feel free to hack us! Every legitimate Bitcoin site runs a vulnerability rewards program - and they all encourage hacking attempts and responsible disclosure to keep themselves secure.

Hi there,
2% charge - give it a shot by leaving the Visa number blank and just specifying an amount. It will break down pricing for you.
Our parent company (QuickBT.com) has been selling Bitcoin since 2013, based out of Toronto, Canada. Our CEO was on Decentral.tv today.
Let me know if you have any other questions! Happy to answer them here,

Hi there,
Theoretically it does work with every VISA globally, we just haven't tested them all yet! We guarantee our service works with Canadian VISA's.
Thanks for the feedback we'll make this clearer as we know more,
SpendBT Team

As soon as we find a merchant provider to do so, you bet we will!

Hi there,
QuickBT.com - our parent company - has been in operation since 2013. QuickBT lets you buy Bitcoin using your debit card.
SpendBT.com launched on Wed Feb 11. SpendBT lets you sell Bitcoin to your debit/credit card. SpendBT's database has stored card data in encrypted form since before we launched - but we have access to decrypt the card data. Our web app encrypts that card data using a public key, and we can decrypt using an offline private key.
The reason we need to access see your card data in plain text is to make the bill payment (not API integrated - therefore not automatic, plus we wait for confirmations). This is different from QuickBT, where we have no access to card data, simply an authenticated yes/no. We wanted to make this differentiation clear to our customers but never meant that we stored plain text values in our database - that was an interpretation and we apologize for the confusion we caused.
For more information, visit our website 
Hope this helps,
SpendBT Team

Hi there,
Answered this above - when a QR code and deposit address is generated it warns "use only once" for now.
To see in action, test it with test-card-number (checksum validates, global test card): 4111111111111111
Thanks for the feedback though!

Hi there,
Let me clarify - we underestimated the demand for the status of "PCI compliance" from our customers - we ~~almost certainly~~ meet/exceed the spec. In fact some comments in this thread suggest we are already compliant, it just was not a requirement since we're not processing Visa transactions. Our obligation is to our customers and we take that quite seriously.
Since we're not a Visa payment processor, it's not mandatory - we're making Bill Payments to Visa's, just like if you asked us to pay your water/hydro bill and gave us the account number.
I'm sorry, but I can't apologize for trying to innovate or start a business - no matter how aggressive the feedback :)
Feel free to hack us! Any vulnerabilities are rewarded via responsible disclosure vrp
Keep the feedback coming,
QuickBT Team
EDIT: We are compliant with the legacy payments card industry spec.

Hi there,
Skip the card number, enter say $100, and see a quote for yourself. We use the lowest bid on popular Canadian exchanges. The USD price movement in the top right corner is simply for reference and pulls from Bitstamp's Last Price Web Socket.

Hi there,
Thanks for your feedback!
I know this thread has gotten a bit sensationalist - but:
1) We have no agreement with Visa - anyone, anywhere in the world can make a bill payment. We have no obligations to Visa, nor are we subject to their fines. We have every obligation to our customers and their personal information (continued below).
2) We have access to a plain text version of your Visa number - we don't keep it on a live server in plain text (!) - this means we can see your Visa card number and is a consideration for customers. We mean this as opposed to our sister site, QuickBT.com, where we have no possible visibility over financial data, you are passed to your bank to complete the transaction. I apologize for the confusion.
3) We have decided to become PCI Compliant to re-assure our customers. We underestimated the demand for this and apologize.
4) It's clear - we don't have years of experience in the credit card industry - we don't process credit card transactions, deal with intermediary banks, or deal with chargebacks. We make manual, push, irreversible Bill Payments. We've secured our customers information as we have in the past - but customers are looking for the recognizable PCI Compliance - and we will deliver before launching.
Thanks for your feedback (across many comments, apologies if I don't answer them all), it's valuable market insight please keep it coming,
SpendBT Team
EDIT: We are compliant with the legacy payments card industry spec.

We don't have a relationship with VISA - anyone can make a bill payment we simply make the process easier and automated.
Hope this helps and please let me know if you have any more questions,

Hi there (throwaway),
No back peddling necessary - want to clear this up. See our clarification in our posts and on our website's about page.
The "solving" we were referring to was customers wanting to see "PCI compliance" - a security standard that applies to Visa merchants (we aren't a merchant, no agreement with Visa, simply bill payment anyone can do). So before we launched, we read through the PCI Security Council docs and are found we are more than compliant. Which isn't surprising: we've been protecting customer data and private keys since 2013 in a much more sensitive environment (Bitcoin) than payment cards. We're looking forward to compliance with CryptoCurrency Security Standard (CCSS), a more modern standard, when it is ready.
Thanks for letting us clear this up!

Hi there,
Thanks for your feedback! Not much sleep last night and reddit don't mix!
We're not storing credit card numbers in plain text, we can access them in plain text so we can make the payment. This means we can see your credit card number and is an important consideration for customers. After ~~30 days~~, we purge the first 12 numbers and keep only (also encrypted) last four. 
As opposed to us passing this information to the bank directly and having no visibility (like QuickBT.com, no visibility of payment details for our protection). Apologies for the confusion and thank you for your continued feedback before we launch.
SpendBT Team
EDIT: Down to 15 days as per customer feedback

If you have a large enough amount of Bitcoin I believe you can move it around your addresses with no fees and it will still confirm.
