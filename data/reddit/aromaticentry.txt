You can only verify a signed message.. not to sign. Website will not ask for private info. Only piblic info... Nothing to scare or brake security of users.

That blockchain data is GB huge and would probably take 3-4 days to get it up in sync.

I use acinq services with success on 
Verry simple API
@_date: 2018-12-09 14:17:10
Next I want to integrate some API with this bot. (page 26 [ to be able to get value from external website when are sent commands like:
* Get Bitcoin/Etherum/Etc price
* Get Market Volume
* Boost &lt;tx id&gt;
* Bitcoin domination
Also, maybe will be a puzzle there with prize in cryptocurrency ;)
