Historically, one that effects global markets comes round about every 30 years. So yeah, good timing.
@_date: 2019-07-20 18:51:20
Well, there's only one logical thing to do now. Break into Area 51 and liberate the time machines!
Bitcoin's release was pretty good timing really. Development just started getting some traction when the GFC hit. I wonder what the parallel timeline would look like if shady banksters hadn't created such a shitstorm when they did.

Can confirm, is gobbledygook to me.

*This is good for bitcoin.*

When a central bank prints more money and it enters circulation (loaned at interest so there is never enough to pay off all bank loans, but that's another story) the amount is recorded. Whether it is ones and zeros on a computer or worthless pieces of paper makes no difference to how *real* the currency is. Its value comes from mutual trust. Not so much from us plebs but the fatcats who make and break economies. Once trust in the backing of a central authority is lost it becomes worthless. 
Having a paper -- or electronic -- trail makes it easier to track transactions. It makes no difference to the amount in circulation. This move is all about taxation. It also paves the way for more authoritarian control of the population in more nefarious ways.

Possibly missed the subtext of what I was saying.

Making any information public when it's not absolutely necessary is just shit opsec.
@_date: 2019-08-08 18:19:36
Are you saying it was *not absolutely necessary*?..
@_date: 2019-08-17 11:45:22
Because there are more mobile users that have autocorrect turned on than not I'd say.

Hong Kong isn't a democracy though. Never has been. Not to mention your second point is completely antithetical to democracy...

That... Isn't how fiat works.
@_date: 2019-08-15 10:22:46
I haven't seen anyone crying. Just a bunch of these thread that seems to be trying to assure themselves more than anything.
@_date: 2019-08-17 12:10:01
Why would you tell lies on the internet like this?
@_date: 2019-08-17 11:55:13
Theoretically, it's not meant to be a minority forcing their will on a majority either. In practice that's exactly what it is, so the opposite would be an improvement on most *Western* countries. Either is preferable to forcing people directly like old mate is advocating.

Because the tax department can send people with guns to kick down your door, put you in chains and throw you in a cage...
@_date: 2019-08-16 06:17:47
So you mean you hate cryptocurrency *regulations*?
@_date: 2019-06-27 12:52:10
Except the part where BTC is open source rather than a closed exam.
@_date: 2019-06-05 02:15:09
Speculation is kind of the opposite of maths.
@_date: 2019-08-21 14:27:05
As I said, that's another story. It *is* the central authority that determines how much banks can loan and maintains control of the ledger. Whether it's recorded as a bank loan or cash is irrelevant.
@_date: 2019-06-27 11:14:57
The dip to where it was a couple of days ago...
@_date: 2019-06-08 09:54:18
Also don't post it on the internet.

Mt. Gox was also the biggest bitcoin exchange...

Jesus was a bit of a commie though, probably thought the powers that be should give *all* their wealth and land to the people.

I don't think it can be the *land of the free* when more people are in prison per capita than any other country.

You can make your own money in what ever way you want. The hard part is convincing people it is worth something. All currencies are fiction. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 22:27:01
Okay so how does eating babies and being antagonistic to outsiders play into that? 
@_date: 2017-09-05 08:24:18
As an outsider the whole situation is a bit sad. Bitcoin was seen as a way to throw off the shackles of regulated currencies and unite with our peers to build a better world. Instead it's been ruined by tribalism just like everything we have done for the last million years. 
@_date: 2019-09-10 13:23:47
Well, this thread certainly demonstrates your point nicely.
@_date: 2019-09-05 05:24:08
Thanks! Every time something like this is posted I check the price and it *has* gone up, because I'm not obsessing over the price every day.

The fact they bought a warehouse for bitcoins makes me think they don't really know what they are doing.
@_date: 2019-09-15 07:49:55
Going through a vendor with good reviews from one of the bigger sites is probably just as reliable as eBay. Reputation is everything on DNM.

The FBI has more BTC than Satoshi. In the wallets we know about anyways.

I agree as long as they only show it in a positive light and guarantee it will go to the moon...
As someone else said, one on different types of blockchains without mentioning any specific coin would be more likely.

They are too busy researching the topic they are currently working on. I don't agree with their reasoning but I doubt looking into it would change their minds. A Kurzgesagt vid can't really add anything that isn't already public knowledge or too technical to be popular.
