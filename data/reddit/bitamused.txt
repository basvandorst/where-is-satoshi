Who is in need of shouting "censorship" the loudest does probably have the least to contribute to a discourse.
There is more than enough space for everyone to try to make ones  voice heard. I what you want to say does not conform to the curation policy of a particular place then go somewhere else. If nobody wants to listen you probaly don't have much intersting to say.

This is not about how best to scale bitcoin. This is about discrediting core.
@_date: 2016-01-14 00:31:15
You should really consider going somewhere else. This is beyond ridiculous at this point.
If you are in need of crying "censorship" then this sub is either not worth posting in or your contribution not worth listening to.

Yes, SegWit increases the transaction throughput without increasing the risks of certain attacks. That's the trick ;)
@_date: 2016-01-16 18:47:59
if quantum computing cracks today's encryption then we would have other problems to worry about. Practically any computer security everywhere would break then.

Classic is working on RBF too, but as user configurable choice!
@_date: 2016-01-17 16:40:24
Classic has RBF too - but it is a user configurable choice
They seem to be stuck in debate though...
@_date: 2016-01-13 23:36:56
Without any curation there would be the same chaos everywhere. I come here *because* of the moderation. That's the value.
There are plenty of other places that have a different focus. You can always start your own discussion group where you can set the rules and culture.
@_date: 2016-01-13 22:45:09
Discussion never had be an issue here, but hostile disruption thereof.
Valuable curation is the very reason I come here for honest discourse. There are enough other subs for the lolz.

Worst case would be that a healthy fee market could maybe develop earlier than necessary. The media would report that bitcoin is so successfull that txn fees rise. Low value usage would be priced out of the market until the technology becomes solid and robust enough to natively support larger txn volumes.
But let us not forget:
This is **not a technical debate** about how to scale. 
This is a *political struggle* about (percieved) power .
@_date: 2016-01-17 17:29:36
Classic will make RBF a user configurable choice
@_date: 2016-01-17 16:41:14
Incorrect. Classic is integrating RBF too!
@_date: 2016-01-17 17:08:43
Don't worry! Classic is fixing all these security issues
@_date: 2016-01-13 22:25:12
What? Did someone argue for bigger blocks? I completely missed that :/ 
Probably because censorship! Thank You Without your curation I might long have been convinced with trustworthy reasoning and credible information that it might actualy be without any risks to agressively fork and scale hard!? 
@_date: 2016-01-13 23:25:32
Maybe another criteria is how much controversy they reap and by whom?
Trustworthy people with technical merit and high integrity do get the most negativity and agression thrown at them from manipulated seeming majority
@_date: 2016-01-13 21:20:38
How do *"non-technically minded people"* judge who is worth beeing trusted as *"technically minded expert"*?
@_date: 2016-01-13 21:18:04
Yeah, no more coration!
More hostility and misinformation! Let it in! Amplify...
It can only become ever more hilarious and obvious..
Btw: Where did the honest trustworthy discourse go?
@_date: 2016-01-13 16:19:47
Do nothing could save bitcoin.
Technically sound decisions would let bitcoin grow strong and resilient, thereby increasing its odds of surviving attacks. 
@_date: 2016-01-14 00:38:10
no reason to get angry ;)
@_date: 2016-01-17 17:13:20
Not true.
SegWit increases transaction throughput without increasing risks of attacks
Classic will have SegWit too
@_date: 2016-01-17 16:29:19
Progress stalled debating nonsense? Classic does it democratically!
@_date: 2016-01-17 16:42:49
but as a user configurable choice 
@_date: 2016-01-17 16:22:07
With Classic zero-conf will be *secure*. 
They are working on it hard 
@_date: 2016-01-17 16:04:23
Core is making significant advancements while Classic seems stuck in debate.
Changing one number can't actually be that hard!
@_date: 2016-01-17 16:35:59
Classic is working on RBF too!
 
But as a user configurable choice...
@_date: 2016-01-13 22:31:24
Isn't downvote to -30 an indicator to recognize sound reasoning and logic? How else can one separate signal from disruptive noise here?  Apparently that seems to be how the algorithms work :/ Dig for the downvotes to find truth.
 It's not a bug. It's a feature!
@_date: 2016-01-13 16:35:24
Care to explain?
@_date: 2016-01-17 17:24:29
No worry! There is a mempool spam fix in Classic
Vote for it!
@_date: 2016-01-17 15:50:00
Awesome work Core! This is huge progress!
It seems classic can't even get changing one single number done!
@_date: 2016-01-13 23:55:39


Well said!
Maybe we could handle even gigablocks in times when everybody loves and supports bitcoin. The question is how can the network survive *difficult* times. Why remove a security limit intended to protect from malicious attacks? Because txn fees might rise a bit temporarily??
Why not trust reputable people with proven technical merit to judge technical risks? Why not allow the network to become strong and resilient and then grow in a safe way?
@_date: 2016-01-14 00:12:48
sounds a lot like politics: may aggression win over reason
@_date: 2016-01-17 17:17:21
True true. Core is making leaps in advancements (gravity of contribution)
while Classic seems to not even get *changing a single number* done
Looks like Classic is stuck in *democracy*
