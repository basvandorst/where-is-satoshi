Market trend reversal at 1600GMT will disprove what your saying here. Questions; why would weak hands panic if the market wasn't suddenly in a sharp downtrend? What caused the sudden downtrend on the day of the futures expiry? Why wouldn't whales manipulate the 'unregulated' market? I think its blatantly obvious that market manipulation and FUD is rampant and rife. I wouldn't be surprised if this was a large group of wall street bankers with more brains more exposure and a hell of a lot more disposable income than that of your average redditor.

The stock markets are a global commodity. If an investor held enough shares of a company and market manipulation wasn't illegal and easily traceable, what sort of things 'could' a whale get away with? I just think it's nieive to assume that there is no interference when regulated futures contracts run against unregulated assets to which everyone has access. It may seem implausible but if there is a way to make money - they (whales) WILL take advantage of it.  Just my opinion but the evidence seems to back it up. I also think they have a stronger grasp on sentiment and general market conditions which causes weak hands to do the vast majority of their work.

It is a bet on an occurance but the occurance can be manipulated. If you were to liken this to your football bet, it would be akin to one team having one leg per man and the 'winning' team having 3 legs per man with the ability to have some bearing on how the other teams legs behave. Multimillion dollar buy and sell walls are the winning team and the losers are the weak hands and FUD believers.  I'm confident that 1600 Will see a reversal in the downward trend..

Surge downwards perhaps

This is crap. Basically begging for your terrible graffiti. It's a no from me.
@_date: 2019-11-04 13:18:25
Yeah I checked the site and stand by my comment.
@_date: 2019-11-08 16:07:14
Yeah. Your here to scam people. Good luck to you.

As if by magic....

No. No further questions.

It's quite clear this person is obviously aware of the scam they are becoming a part of. Not sure your patronising statement adds anything here.

He ordered 6 hits. Fact. Libertarianism is all well and good until you kill people in the name of it.

-ridicule anyone who disagrees with your absolute non-story
The hero that bitcoin doesn't need but always seems to end up attracting.
Enjoy your millions in profit by 2022.

It's a fad. Just like the internet and cars. People will soon recognize that progress is pointless and we should revert to time honoured ways of hunting, gathering and trading goat skins.

But it's not frightening.
@_date: 2018-11-06 13:23:48
Let me Google that for you.

Aliens have an interest in our moon and having spent some time in r/cryptocurrency have decided that Bitcoin is the quickest way there.

I like to take my advice from the biggest scammers in history. Keeps me poor and humble.

Don't think that's how markets work. Downvoting for idiocy.
