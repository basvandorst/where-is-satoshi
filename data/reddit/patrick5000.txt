I asked Xapo 2 times by email if my next of kin can claim my bitcoins in their Xapo vault And they never got back to me
So the big question that needs answering is can Coinbase and Xapo keep your bitcoins and not give them to your next of kin if your next of kin has no passwords ect to get the bitcoins themself

Does someone know if you die and have Bitcoins in Coinbase vault 
Can your next of kin claim them without knowing passwords ect  like money in a bank account which can be claimed if you die

When you withdraw foreign money from your  € Xapo debit card crossborder it still it not competitive with  doing the same withdrawl with a topped up € Visa card  from  Bank of  Ireland   .
Would  like to stop using my Bank of Ireland topped up Visa Credit card crossborder  but hope Xapo  gives a better exchange rate in €  to nearer  the adverage € bitcoin price at time of withdrawl.
I like Xapo alot and their app    hope  they  add a vault and wallet soon for  litecoin and dogecoin

When Xapo coverts your bitcoin to Fiat currency   the exchange rate they give you could be 10% less than the offical Bitcoin to  € rate  on the main markets.
I was in Ukraine last month and tested out the Xapo card
Biggest and main bank in Ukraine I used was  Privat bank
4,000 ukraine currency   cost me   €166  in physical  € to get  in 
side Bank
4,000 ukraine   currency cost me   € 172  with drawing from this banks atm with 0 atm withdrawl fees using my  Bank of Ireland  toped up Visa card
4 000 ukraine currency  cost me  €182 withdrawing from this same banks atm after above withdrawl  using my Xapo debit card and again no atm withdrawl fees with this Transation.
