Bitcoin spinner also is only based on Mt.Gox.

This could have been avoided.
DON`T let a single user manipulate/affect/push the whole perceived price of the Btc for every other user, more than 1% downward per day. 
Limit the amount of selling down the buy orders a single user can do. After pushing the price of the currency 1% down, the sell order should simply hold until its bought up or until next day.
This should be ok for any real user and even great since they want to get as much fiat as possible and they get more by letting others eat into the sell order rather than selling down and they know the currency will not collapse in a matter of seconds it will atleast take some time. It would not be like a ban on selling down but only a brake of the system so it does not crash. A car needs brakes. 
Who wants to use a car that crashes time and time again. Who wants to use a currency that crashes? Thats a failed currency. 
If Mt.Gox cant provide that why look at the price of Mt.Gox. Why use them?
It slows down the development, it allows people to get funds into the exchange and to act. 
It also smoothes out the fluctuations in value that bitcoin have which in turn would increase the value of the currency.
If Mt.Gox don´t want bitcoin to succeed they are doing a good job at it.
Only bad users with the intent of causing panic would have an interest of selling down hard.
Why because this makes bitcoin which is supposed to be a currency appear like a Jojo. Something 99% would stay away from.
So there is a solution. Limit the ability for nefarious people to Flashcrash the market.
This solution should be proposed by the Bitcoin Foundation. And they could give their approval only to exchanges that have a flashcrash break system.
