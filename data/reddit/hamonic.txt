I've gotten to the point where I just roll my eyes, get slightly annoyed and then close the app and move on lmfao

We were all so spoiled for the last couple of weeks in 2017
I feel like I've been waiting ages for another monster bull run. I feel like a 6 year old waiting for Christmas

Someone left me a mean inbox message telling me that I'm an idiot and that Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin and something about removing the original code and they reference "Segshit" blah blah 
I don't even really understand what they're yammering about but it was very aggressively worded and it almost ruined 5 mins of my morning :(
I didn't know where else to share my feelings.

I know the drill by now is to be patient and wait it out 
But I feel like it's been so long since there's been a nice little  run  :(

Whenever I get impatient over the price I just think to myself... “could be worst... could have been one of those bitconnect people who lost everything"
Works everytime.

I know a lot of people make their money through trading and day trading so I'm not bashing them at all
I got into Bitcoin because I wanted to put my money somewhere and leave it there and let it grow over months and years. For me I'm not greedy or impatient, if I make $1000-$2000 at the end of the year, I'm happy. Profit is profit  (you're not gonna find a smaller fish than Mei know haha)
I feel that if you're into day trading, it's no different than taking your money to a casino or a poker table (nothing bad about gambling - I love the casino)
But the only way you win is that you walk away when you're up or you eventually end up giving every single cent back to to house in the long run. 
Day trading comes with a certain mental state and a different perspective and a huge risk. You just have to ask yourself if the risk youre risk is worth what you have on the table 
That's just my 2 cents

I love watching reddit come together to help total strangers

Hodler are smart and calculated and veterans at this stuff 
I'm just an idiot lol

Oh yea I couldn't be bothered to sell now. Maybe at the beginning I probably wouldn't have been able to stomach it. 
So in a way I see Coinbase's restriction as a blessing. More or less there to save me from myself 
Plus Quadriga UI looks way too confusing and way too much effort to learn lmfao

I'm with you. I don't even know how to get my money out if I wanted to and I'm way too lazy to learn lol
