When billions do &amp; use it every second yes
@_date: 2018-11-22 16:42:27
I think I hit a nerve. 
Lower your salt intake. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 21:25:54
What makes you think I'm trolling. All I've read in the news about BTC is that its falling.
What big things have happened to incorporate it's existence as a valid currency?
What's being done to help legitimize it for the average person?
@_date: 2018-11-30 14:09:54
@_date: 2018-11-23 18:20:01
Most likely not. 99% of the people who buy BTC nowadays are using it as an investment &amp; not a currency.
Why use BTC when other currency is more readily available &amp; accepted?
Truth is - is that it's not a solid investment. Get out while you can. Sunk Cost Fallacy applies here. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 21:45:27
I agree. I know lots of people WANT it too but it's just not feasible.
BTC was fun while it lasted. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 20:48:41
Backed by the stability of the U.S Economy that engages in trillions of dollars worth of trades?
You sound too edgy 
@_date: 2018-11-21 21:49:49
U.S dollar is still more stable than bitcoin. That's undeniable.
@_date: 2018-11-22 16:11:51
I think his strawman arguments &amp; his mental deflections are hilarious! 
"akshully bitcoin is anything u want it 2 b'
haha ok 
@_date: 2018-11-22 16:10:27
Strawman argument alert!!!!
@_date: 2018-11-28 23:59:22
Idiots run in the family for sure
@_date: 2018-11-23 18:22:08
100% wrong. Just lol...
People need to spend BTC &amp; not hold it. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 21:54:13
Yep both are risky investments. 
@_date: 2018-11-23 18:27:16
@_date: 2018-11-22 18:38:04
1.3k is coming for sure
@_date: 2018-11-21 20:55:31
Over 3 billion people on this planet engage in some form of trade with the U.S dollar. I'd prob say even more than half the pop of the planet.
U.S currency is 100% more stable than bitcoin for a reason. Part of it is faith but there's more too it.
Truth is bitcoin will continue to slump. 
@_date: 2018-11-23 18:23:13
Salt lord!
@_date: 2019-01-29 17:54:17
u could sold &amp; lived off nearly 100k in intertest a year, kek
@_date: 2018-11-20 21:23:53
Strawman argument
@_date: 2018-11-23 18:27:04
"I'm so salty that other people's words HURT MEE REEEEEE"
@_date: 2018-11-26 22:20:39
Saving this so I can laugh in a few days
@_date: 2018-11-21 21:07:29
I cashed out when it hit 15k. I'm happy with my choices.
I have a little under 2 BTC left that I've been hodling now. If it goes up thats great, if down thats okay too - it's not a huge source of income for me.
I see BTC for what it is - a get rich or poor short term gamble. I got out at 15k because I believe that it was going to crash soon &amp; I'm glad I got out. 
At the pace people are adopting BTC in 100 years it still won't be mainstream. Nothing new is happening. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 15:55:49
He wants the clout.
Making claims without proof? zero chance
@_date: 2018-11-28 23:58:34
Thats a big if
@_date: 2018-11-23 18:25:17
Agreed. People are gullible as hell.  99% of the people who own BTC just hodl it &amp; not use it as a currency.
I got out at 15k &amp; made off like a madman. I still have a few btc left for entertainment but I'm so glad I got out. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 22:15:06
Only 1% of people actually spend BTC that have it
@_date: 2018-11-21 21:18:54
Eh thats the world man.
Just make money, invest it smart and you'll be okay. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 16:48:22
Hahah sureee
@_date: 2018-11-26 22:17:00
but but the evil banks &amp; stuff!!!! 
@_date: 2018-11-23 18:37:46
@_date: 2018-11-20 01:22:27
Laws were passed unfavorably against it + hacked exchanges. 
@_date: 2018-11-24 15:53:48
@_date: 2018-11-23 16:39:10
It'l drop to 1k. Be patient. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 21:47:43
I said invest it smart.
Bitcoin was never a smart investment. It has always been risky as fuck.
I dropped 5% of my income back in 2014 as a risk in case something happened. It wasn't a smart move, it was risky and paid off. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 22:24:15
hahah whys that
@_date: 2018-11-23 02:07:27
I only lost half my worth, its fine!
@_date: 2018-11-22 16:46:14
Lol, idk why you're so upset.
Did you really feel the need to go through my comments, find one &amp; try your best to insult my grammar?
But seriously - lower your salt intake it may do your mental health some good
@_date: 2018-11-21 21:04:24
Sure. That's how interest works.
@_date: 2018-11-21 20:58:29
Correct, debt is needed for an economy to be tangible. 
@_date: 2018-11-30 14:10:30
You must live in an alternate reality
@_date: 2018-11-30 14:11:11
FUn read, great troll. 6/10
@_date: 2018-11-22 16:41:14
ad hominem.
Why are you so salty?
@_date: 2018-12-01 10:37:53
It's going to be 10 mil in 2019.... I can taste the future I've put all my savings into BTC imma be rich
@_date: 2018-12-16 15:39:29
Thats cuz 99.9% used it as an investment &amp; not a currency
@_date: 2018-12-01 10:36:45
I wish more people would use BTC as a currency rather than an investment. The price would deff go up &amp; become more stable.
