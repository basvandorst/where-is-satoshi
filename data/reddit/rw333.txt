people say it's a 'good price' because it just crashed, so people like to buy the dip, but you're right, bitcoin price is pure speculation and if you think about the fundamentals, it's worth $0 because it has close to zero adoption as a currency, and it's slow AF, not saying you shouldn't get in, just know that you're gambling 
@_date: 2018-01-18 05:04:22
he's right, it's not, visa process 1500+ payments/second, btc processes 3-4/seconds with high ass fees, i swiped a visa credit card everyday, i haven't and won't be (in the near future) buy a coffee with btc

@_date: 2018-01-18 09:21:08
Your anecdotal experience adds no value to your argument, or lack of one. For every 'success story' there's a ton of other failed technology. Everything is 20/20 in hindsight. All you're saying is that successful technology takes time for adoption. But no one knows whether BTC will even get adopted. All speculations aside, BTC is slow and has very high fees. Those are the current state of the tech, which hinders BTC from being a payment system.  
Then you went off into an irrelevant tangent and it looked like you copied and pasted some vague/superficial 'advice' for a 'young person' on the internet. GJ 
@_date: 2018-01-12 23:13:32
lol the more TA posts/material I try to learn the more I learn  that it's complete BS, there's nothing scientific about it, all the indicators are just derived off past data, you can't even assign a confidence level or a probability to predictions, all you can say is 'It's likely do x' or 'it looks bullish'. Everything is just arbitrary and you can literally teach this stuff to a monkey  
@_date: 2018-01-13 02:54:32
only a small amount of people (noobs) bought at 19k, you got all the people that bought the dip between 13 and 13.5 that will take profits at 15k, if it hits

Not that I wish for this, but you know they don't have to attack the btc system, they can just ban the exchange/gateway between Fiat and crypto, btc would be worth nothing if you can't convert it to cash
@_date: 2017-12-30 06:03:35
Lol it's always been like that, people can give jack shit about the banks, most people (including myself) invest in btc to make money, only a small percentage actually yells "fck the banks" and believe in that shit, banks are here to stay and it's fine, there's a reason why ripple is going up, bc it actually has real world use case, if it's solving a problem, IDC if it's centralized or not, just accept that btc is all speculation had no adoption as of now

@_date: 2017-12-06 19:49:59
yea that thought just hit my mind while I was eating lunch lol, it's definitely possible, big whales can accumulate a ton of btc, buy the future contracts when it come out, and then make a huge dump to tank the price, the future contract from CBOE starts trading this Sunday and the shortest contract is ~1 week. I'm going to have stop losses ready and watch the future market the upcoming week. It doesn't hurt to be careful. This sub reddit is becoming an echo chamber for btc bulls to the point where any cautious analysis or comments gets called fud. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:43:46
Leaving crypto on an exchange is not comparable to crashing into a car, it's just like people who leave money on any other type of exchanges, it's pretty safe, I rather leave security to the professionals than a little hard drive that I manage myself, and why would you need a hardware Wallet just mindblows me, just write down your seed after you make an account on the network and delete everything else, as long as you got your private on a piece of paper it's fine
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:10:28
look up a what a future is, it's not an asset, but a derivative.  there's only once price of btc, the future contract itself is priced in the future market, there's not BTC price in the futures market

so true, my god you spoke my mind, half of me just wanna see btc crash so all the uneducated investors on here can lose money, everyone is so confident because the market is bullish and every analysis that actually has some base to it is considered FUD, as they say, everyone is a good investor when the market is bullish

@_date: 2017-12-07 07:18:52
Honestly if youre using coinbase and only got a couple k in btc, there's really no point. All digital assets are insured on GDAX. Especially if you're going out there and BUYING a wallet. People lose their private keys all the time. If gdax is hacked, you'll get paid out. Keeping it on coinbase is probably safer 
@_date: 2018-09-25 02:28:47
You think? Show your position with the post and maybe you’ll be taken seriously, why would people use bitcoin to buy gifts?? Last time I checked amazon accept credit card 
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:40:02
Because people are human, it's naturally wired into our brain, there will always be fear, and it's easier said than done when you got 10k+  position, and stop calling everyone that decides to sell having weak hands, sometimes people access the risk and makes a decision, everything in hindsight is 20/20, but theres nothing wrong with being cautious, and most of the people here haven't even traded stocks before, and never experienced taking huge losses, stop extrapolating the performance of btc in the past month to discourage everyone from being cautious
@_date: 2018-09-21 03:32:26
Read your first sentence and it made zero sense, market at ATH and the you claim that upcoming market is already bear trend? Lol what? We’re in a bull market, people been claiming bear market is coming for years. Go short the SPY if you think it’s coming. It’s definitely not “certain”.
If market crashes, bitcoin will crash even harder.

What motivation does an exchange have to do so? They take your money from fees either way, the exchange always wins whether market is up or down
@_date: 2018-05-26 00:42:33
You would actually get tax deduction since you incurred short term loss (assuming you bought in less than a year ago), you can write off up to 3000 a year, with your holdings I imagine you loss less than that, so at the end of the year, if you won’t make any money back from crypto (or any other short term investments) then you can deduct your losses when you report taxes next year.  
Say I’ve loss 1k so far, I sell and buy back in Robinhood and crypto bounces back a bit and I sell and make 500, my net loss would be 500 for the year and I can deduct that off my taxes. If I don’t sell the second time I buy and just keep holding, then I will incur net loss of 1k this year and I can write that off. Regardless, you won’t be paying more money if you sell, in fact you will get tax deduction if you report it. 
@_date: 2018-08-18 00:56:25

no it doesn’t matter how you look at it, you can determine the value of currency by looking at price of goods, let say a sandwich cost me $10 dollars today, it will still be $10 in a week, you can’t say that for btc (assuming I can even buy a sandwich with bitcoin), it’s the opposite of stable
@_date: 2018-05-30 06:55:20
You’re missing my point, it’s a risky asset right now so you should NOT be converting ALL your cash to it in times of political uncertainty, which is what the post is implying.

Yes, your feelings are not reliable and the market does not care about your feelings, that’s way too high of a percentage of your income, if you really want to buy bitcoin put in at most 10%, save the rest or invest in yourself (education) esp. at your age, understand that bitcoin is gambling

Nothing is wrong, bitcoin is speculative asset and there was never a guarantee that it will go up, even if all the memes and shit posts in here “predticts” it to moon, and also a splash of reality, there’s no “We” there are winners and losers in the market, when you cash out you make money from the person who buys is from you

I don’t see how your claim is valid, whether people know about the stock market is a different point, managing your own finances is something you can learn, average market returns (using S&amp;P) is around 7-10% historically, (recently way higher) this is way more than inflation per year, people are in the stock market because they want to grow their wealth. If the only goal is to hedge against inflation, there’s bonds, gold/silver and other safer options, which people DO store part of their assets in

@_date: 2018-06-12 03:14:55
it's a debate-able issue once you get into the details, but most people just think it's bad because it has the word "debt" attached to it, not all debt is bad, sometimes debt is good (mortgage vs all cash), 20 trillion is a lot to a person, but think about US GDP (19 trillion), it's like I'm making 100,000k a year and have 100,000 to pay off, thats not an unhealthy ratio, you have to look at both sides of the balance sheet (how much you owe + how much you have/generate), a million dollar loan is nothing to a billionaire. It's good for the US because it means that's it's highly leveraged and money flows in to drive the economy. US's debt to GDP ratio is no where as high as other developed countries.

The national debt is not a crisis, it's a good thing  
US dollar has a target inflation rate because it's good for the economy, no one force you to hold US dollar for years, there are plenty of value storage options (bonds, index, stocks)  
Source for your 80% figure? (70% of American's debt is from mortgage, you want everyone to start paying full cash for houses?)  
Expand on what mistakes, what are some hypothetical situations that would make the banks fail?  
If US gov/bank really fails, bitcoin will be just as useless and there will be be bigger things to worry about  
instead of parroting off misinformed post and do some of your own research from reliable sources.

Stop spreading bullshit like this, the only thing to ‘learn’ from your experience is that you got unlucky and it just happened that bitcoin went up, no one knows what’s going to happen next. Your “expectations” is as good as me flipping a coin. Seeing a couple hundreds dollar loss a day? That is nothing, people have already loss thousand and 10s of thousands from the current bear market and it’s not “making a mistake” if you decide pull out your remaining capital to be safe. People don’t invest and expect to lose everything, everyone will sell after they loss a certain % that is up to them. It’s not a mistake. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 20:29:54
the only reason btc even hit the ATH is because you have 'average joes' coming in to buy in December, if you "bitcoin believer" were the only people buying you will be just holding empty bags, get over yourself, everyone acts independently with their own money. i don't see people on r/robinhood, r/stocks, r/wallsteetbets telling people to fucking HODL, people came here to take profit, either cut your losses now or risk crying more in the following month, there are winners in the market and there are losers, just accept that you're the latter before you bleed out.

Learn to set stop losses and have an exit plan for speculative investments, lesson learned, if I were you I would just cut your losses and deduct your short term loss off your taxes next year. Your position is pretty trivial so just treat is a learning experience 
@_date: 2018-03-13 23:44:27
You might as well just flip a coin or ask a money to throw a dart, all pseudo-science, stop wasting your time on learning this stuff lol
@_date: 2018-03-17 22:53:23
This is how you know charting is complete bullshit lol
@_date: 2018-03-20 03:12:13
Better advice would be to have an exit plan and know when to cut your losses, not let’s lose everything 
@_date: 2018-03-17 18:09:55
You can just trade btc futures
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:15:10
Might wanna learn about basics of markets lol, this lack of understanding is scary, market is a zero sum game, when someone is taking profit some else loses money, someone has to buy the asset from you to hold your bag 
@_date: 2018-03-20 02:21:50
Not impossible but no one knows, and a ton of people already lost a ton of money..:(
@_date: 2018-03-13 20:04:53
You would have to be a fucking idiot to agree with this completely and logically flawed post smh 
@_date: 2018-03-30 15:59:40
I don’t understand the rational here, you got 50k but DONT want to invest in stocks/bonds, and other safer asserts? I don’t know how much 50k is to your family member, but if it’s less than 10% of total saving, I guess you can throw it in bitcoin and treat it as the very high risk portion of the porfolio, but even so, I would definitely not buy in now. The market sentiment has been very bearish and it’s worth it to wait it until you see a reverse in crypto sentiment (whenever that maybe and use your judgement) 
@_date: 2018-03-23 02:56:14
At least 100? Anything less than makes the potential return pretty meaningless 
@_date: 2018-03-23 03:06:20
Going to sound like a broken record, past performance does not guarantee future returns and using the statistic median here is inappropriate and means absolutely nothing 
@_date: 2018-03-17 18:18:56
Weigh each purchase by amount and then average it (.3 btc * 10k +.8 btc * 8k)/1.1 btc

Been out for awhile, it’s funny how many people hold bags and just bleed out during a bear market because of greed and fomo, people need to learn to cut their losses. If you really think it will bounce back up you would still sell and wait for a better reentry 
@_date: 2018-03-17 23:02:37
Come to this thread and count the number of bag HODLer’s.....
I’ve been reducing my position since Jan and I’m all out by now, and don’t plan on going back in for awhile, my capital is better used in the stock market, it’s going to take a lot to reverse the market sentiment for crypto. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 00:55:34
This post is FUD, FUD of losing more money or the remaining capital you have, so you start calling FUD every time there’s a downward price movement and have to go on here to make a shit post to calm your balls cuz its sweating, get your head out of the sand and prepare an exit plan. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 23:02:45
plebs posting non-sense, bullshit, baseless claims that's gets repeated on here to make other plebs feel better while they bleed out in this bear market. and reverting to the same logical fallacies in attempt to explain price movement, let me list all of them for you:  
1. bitcoin rebounded in year 20XX, so it will do this year, too  
2. claiming that you're 'in it for the tech' but the most common incentive is "don't regret not buying when bitcoin is (enter random number between 100k and 10 mil) in (some bs time interval)  
3. Promoting irrational and baseless FOMO  
4. Finding scapegoat to blame every time there's downward price movement and trying to come up with some conspiracy theory  
5. HODL herd mentality  
6. Spreading the 'fiat is bad' anectdote like parrots while never taken econ 101, and then getting concerned about the price movement in DOLLARS  
@_date: 2018-03-13 20:09:22
The bulls will just keep making up speculative and baseless narrative in a bear market, don’t be the last one to hold the bag lol, any downward movement is “healthy” until you’re left with nothing, don’t be the XIV guy
@_date: 2018-03-28 16:51:09
No not really, speak for yourself (and maybe half of this sub that think there’s a Bitcoin we) speculating bitcoin is a zero sum game, just hope you win lol, banks are great, they provide a service, inflation has always been around and that’s why you invest your cash, and I much rather hold on to my dollar in the short term, when inflation is 2-3 % a year than holding a “currency” that loses more than half of its value in months 
@_date: 2018-02-13 16:13:06
Wow you can count? One of the many dumbass shitpost on this subreddit. 
@_date: 2018-03-28 08:28:59
Pretty stupid argument, pretty sure everyone with half a brain knows about inflation, that doesn’t mean you should go buy bitcoin, there’s many other safer place to park your money (bonds, stocks, property, ect) you buy bitcoin because it’s high risk high reward. Hedging against inflation is nothing new, and it does not mean you should park all your money in a high risk asset, especially in a bear market. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 22:28:54
Yes go catch the falling knife (more like a large sword), even though when it’s been falling for 3 months
@_date: 2018-03-22 18:26:31
Definitely not a store of value given the current market lol

Only if you believe in voodoo magic, this chart says nothing
@_date: 2018-02-13 15:48:27
Fake news lol, there’s no way this will happen in the near future
@_date: 2018-03-21 22:44:37
Wow you divided one number into another, congrats 
@_date: 2018-02-10 16:39:48
One of the few facts I read on this sub^
@_date: 2018-03-31 18:39:30
It can’t be any easier, go to coinbase and sign up, link your bank account, and just buy it. I advise you to have an exit plan if the downtrend continues, (i.e. I will pull out once I lose 30%) unless you want to lose all 5k, don’t follow the HODL herd mentality. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 00:39:01
Not a good sign lol, pretty much your bank is considering lending money to you for buying bitcoin is too risky, can be because it’s bitcoin, you, or both 
@_date: 2018-03-13 23:24:45
Jokes on you...expecting the average joe to use Linux is ridiculous, I work with Linux systems for work but there is absolutely no reason for an average computer user to use it Linux over Mac OS or windows for their personal computer
@_date: 2018-02-27 04:34:50
This will probably get downvoted, but if you got less than 5k, I would just leave it on the exchange. The ledger wallet is just a expensive ass insurance policy that makes people feel safe because they’re holding onto it rather the exchange, when in fact your money and coins on coinbase are insured already 
@_date: 2018-03-28 21:01:27
Around half of hedge funds lose money, being a “hedge fund manager” doesn’t make his opinions or predictions any more valid, why waste time on this? 
@_date: 2018-03-17 18:30:39
I invest part of monthly paycheck too....in actual investments, this is all fun and speculative, so I would just keep it capped, would you go play roulette with 10% of your checking every month? 
@_date: 2018-03-10 19:44:04
Yes, there are people with it on r/Robinhood , it just takes awhile to get to everyone , which is good because you don’t want to see shit crashing all the time. Robinhood is s good company and they got a reputation to uphold lol
@_date: 2018-03-26 20:24:00
It’s make sense tbh, all the bitcoin believers overestimates the amount of people that are actually in it for the technology when in fact most of the hype was due to price movement and that’s what cause that huge price increase in December, but now the price movement is very bearish, the new buyers, who were the ones pushing up the price in dec in the first place, got burned and have no interest in buying back in, because mass adoption and the tech it’s most irrelevant to them. Most people are in it for the quick gainz. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:19:53
Man I just count how many of those dumbass posts keep showing up as the price keeps going down 
@_date: 2018-02-21 09:17:21
Awful decision, it’s not worth the risk, your 401k has tax exemption, and on top of that you’re losing employer match. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 06:46:11
Lol just keep telling yourself that until you’re the last one holding the bag, scarcity means nothing when’s there’s no demand
@_date: 2018-03-30 15:49:45
Human greed lol
@_date: 2018-07-20 01:42:06
Provide a deterministic and consistent definition of “confirmed bottom” then I’ll start considering this TA bs lol
@_date: 2018-07-20 01:37:22
If you’re buying because of the ETF rumor, it’s too late, already priced in, if you want to bet on whether there will actually be an ETF in the near term, sure go ahead 
@_date: 2018-07-22 20:49:56
Do you have a confidence interval for this? Would be more useful to validate 
@_date: 2018-07-07 03:24:56
If it worked consistently you wouldn’t be sharing it 
@_date: 2018-07-18 20:17:59
Unless someone has a position, it’s just a guess, all actual prediction should show the commitment (money) 
@_date: 2018-07-18 02:04:57
You don’t have to time dips and tops to make quick money in bitcoin, the volatility itself is enough for quick 10% gains (or losses) 
@_date: 2018-07-19 14:53:20
Only the poor thinks about “mooning” with a high risk and speculative investment 
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:56:16
No you're the one that's not grasping this shit lol, most people got in btc to get rich, and because people have bought in, it was so hyped up in Nov and Dec, in terms of btc adoption, it hasn't done jack shit 
@_date: 2018-03-31 18:48:04
You just don’t get the implication of the comment lol, it’s not nonsense
@_date: 2018-07-25 03:03:51
Lol buy the rumor sell the news, tread carefully, if it doesn’t get approved everyone is fucked
@_date: 2018-07-10 19:31:51
Just change it for usd on an exchange and then transfer the usd into your bank then  your PayPal

Set aside money you’re willing to risk
Set a price limit (when bitcoin hit this price I sell)
Set a stop loss (when bitcoin drop below this price I sell to cut losses)
Make your purchase and stick with your preset limits 
Remember that purpose of investing is to make money, not time highs and lows 
@_date: 2018-04-06 17:31:34
Gotta give it to you, that logic is almost air tight...
@_date: 2018-04-05 03:21:20
Theres nothing wrong with it, people are just parrots and they see one Reddit post and starts drawing conclusions 
@_date: 2018-04-18 02:14:54
At least 10-100 mil I imagine, anything under a million is peanuts, many retail investors have that much invested 
@_date: 2018-04-05 23:00:51
Wow, just wow lol, I literally browse this subreddit for shitposts, but this is next level lol
@_date: 2018-04-05 00:08:46
Some people just aren’t going to make it let them be, just because a guy sold all his stuff and put it all on red at a roulette table and won doesn’t make him a genius lol 
@_date: 2018-04-07 02:30:51
Nothing wrong with it, just stick to your decision, I  cashed out awhile ago but it’s never too late to preserve capital 
@_date: 2018-04-05 00:16:02
Lol nailed it, but most people on this sub don’t understand that they’re  just making money from each other while the exchanges are making the real money, while they have their head deep in the sand of “the fight against banks and fiat and mooning”
@_date: 2018-04-03 03:38:00
Gambling and to make money bc I got bored of stocks, but banks are cool, I got nothing against them, they provide a service and I use it 
@_date: 2018-04-03 03:41:28
Set stop loss and stick with it, if it goes up afterward, don’t beat yourself over it because you’re not a prophet 
@_date: 2018-04-05 03:18:31
Rofl “pretty much the bottom”, the bottom is 0, this type of post have been showing up since 15k lol, why don’t you put money where you mouth is and buy bitcoin on margins? Max our a couple credit cards, take out a few loans. I mean what’s the point of telling others to buy when the gains aren’t yours? 
@_date: 2018-04-05 20:48:32
Completely useless, anyone can fit a line to a set of data points, doesn’t mean you can extrapolate it to future price movement, TA is pseudo science bc nothing is held accountable, there’s no validation metrics bc we cant simulate/reproduce the underlying process (market movement) and verify it, when ever you have any sort of actual models for predicting, you would naturally want to know it’s accuracy. There’s actually nothing technical about TA. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 20:37:00

Stop acting captain hindsight my god, everyone can a read a chart, price history doesn’t mean shit, how does the fact that bitcoin was 300 dollars years ago relevant to the current situation? ITS NOT 
@_date: 2018-04-09 22:26:48
What probabilities? Lol I’ve never seen a single distribution or confidence interval from TA predictions
