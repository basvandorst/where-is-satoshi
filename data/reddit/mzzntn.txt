You've completely right, but there are smart contracts that solve this problem, in two words, the buyer and the seller put the same amount of bitcoin (the price) on the smart contract and both must confirm the transaction so the seller can have his money back.  
And yes in the mail there aren't reasons the mail says that "if you want your money faster please insert the shipping code" today is Sunday maybe tomorrow i will update this post.

So the idea to solve the spam, is going back to a "pay as you go" concept, where i need to pay something for each phone call that I make, imho it isn't a so smart idea, maybe i'm missing something

Probably not the fastest, surely the most secure.

Why is lightning network not yet implemented in Bitcoin Qt? 
I know that it's in a beta version but, it ought be implemented at a least as option.

Thanks for your opinion, but if we follow what you said the only important thing is the food, and all the companies that don't produce foods will close, and maybe even work an earn will worth less than wait, so probably a currency that lost value is a better solution. 
I'm playing the devil's advocate only to better understand and stress out all theories :)

So you think that in the future we will buy only things that are strictly necessary to our survival?

Thanks, I see your point but, even in the pc market sometime I thought "you know i'm going to wait the next generation" but there are some good like fruits where the prices and the goods are always the same because there a central bank that tries to deflate/inflate the value so it can be stable, but with bitcoin (and if the price will always increase) you might think "ok i'm going to wait the next year to buy 1 banana" and probably you will apply the same mechanism with all goods.

I really like your point, in the future, we will lost less and less bitcoin, but I disagree on the assumption that we NEED to buy stuff, there was an article time ago that talks about a family that sell all their owns, they buy a camper and wait, wait until bitcoin will probably worth more, we call them crazy, but probably in the future it will not considered a crazy behavior, because "ok I can wait the next year for that shirt".
