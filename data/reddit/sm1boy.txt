Does anyone know an online broker who doesn't have an expiration date on bitcoin shares?

It's been like this year on year from what I see, seems pretty normal.

While I don't think he should be chastising anyone who is doing something crea he has his right to his opinion right or wrong regardless of whether he could do it better or not.
I can watch TV and know if a show is good or not without being a director myself.

You're completely right he wasn't criticizing the app, my mistake.
I guess he's objecting to the way that she's promoting herself, it still doesn't mean he needs to be an app creator himself for his input to have any weight.

It's a business and they can refuse service to anyone they like. It's nothing to do with his crimes that will more than likely be an excuse or reason for them to justify refusal of service, they don't agree with his actions and don't want his business... If they don't process his payments someone else will with or without bitcoin being an option. 
If you were the owner of a business and thought that having a business relationship of any level with a person could reflect badly on you in the public eye you wouldn't want to deal with them either.

Ok you've now confirmed my suspicion.

Sorry it's a reference to the TV show startup I just couldn't help myself

Since we need bitcoin to be widely adopted by the public ...

Isn't that what I said in my first comment?

How could it possibly be good for bitcoin? 
I love how accurate I am about your age. I won't be replying to you anymore , have fun

I've got a feeling you're 14

I'm not dodging anything, all I said was that the news will definitely put a completely negative sentiment about this subject. You are an angry child and it's apparent of how young you are from the way you communicate

I really feel that this won't have a positive reflection on bitcoin? It's now going to be viewed by the media as the currency of criminals and racists. It's going to get the negative exposure PayPal avoided by refusing to work with him.
@_date: 2018-11-16 09:29:37
Dude you're literally 14 
@_date: 2018-03-10 21:29:05
So it's like PayPal?

If you don't think that's how the papers are going to spin it you're cray cray.

A growing community isn't really a bad thing though and if it has the attention of the masses then you have to take the positives with the negatives.
