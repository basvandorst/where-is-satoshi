He cannot do whatever he wants with it because his parents have control of his bank account and he has no car (no means to travel to buy them).

I know right? I'm a finance major in school with a considerable amount of trading knowledge and have never heard about it.

is this for real? why would anyone do this?

do you have a bank account? online transactions are a lot easier (at least for me) than physically buying them from someone. How do you convince your parents to let you buy them? Give them a presentation about the bitcoin and its purposes or have them watch a youtube vid about them. If I were you I wouldn't put a ton of money into bitcoin just because it is a very risky investment, probably much riskier than your dads day trading even (although I don't know the details). Just show them that you know what you are doing and you are educated and knowledgeable about the investments you want to undertake.

probly not lol. but if it continues for a while it certainly will. I'm not holding anything atm so im good for now

no i am dead serious. I seriously have never read about it in any of my textbooks or in class. I'm guessing its because with a lot of trading float times are basically non-existent because of how electronic most markets are now days.

might as well try to stop it and save yourself some money. Then again i dont know if they would ban you or something like that

gotcha. makes sense. using coinbase that float time is fucking large
