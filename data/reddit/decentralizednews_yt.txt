The fallacy you fall into is that "everyone can just pay 1sat/byte" and wait 24 hours and it will work. When more and more people continue use BTC obviously that won't be the case. All it takes is another few million people transacting per year and your 1 sat/byte won't be sufficient for 24 hours.
More people ARE going to use BTC.

Yeah, I am not sure why this is posted in lol... they are paying using ETH if you watch the video.
Right now the fees on Ethereum are about 0.01 USD, Median wait time is 14 seconds(ETH scaled blocksize somewhat not that long ago).
[  shows current prices/reccomended.
BTC right now is about 0.76 USD [
For comparison, the average minimum wage in 2016 per month was 33 USD. Its obviously going way lower now due to their hyperinflation. These people can't afford 0.76 Fees for buying one thing here, then another thing there, then another thing the next day. [
Obvious why they paid with ETH.
(playing devils advocate) BCH today is about 0.0039 USD
