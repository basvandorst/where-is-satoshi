On a side note, has anyone else mysteriously lost BTC?

Thank you for this update. If this error occurs, maybe it would've been better to announce it when it began, instead of when many people have been complaining.

I actually just did everything this morning and everything's stuck at pending.
When did problems begin to occur?
