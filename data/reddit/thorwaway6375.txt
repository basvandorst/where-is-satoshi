I think it shot up really fast after SegWit. I was quite surprised to see the panic selling almost 2 weeks before Aug 1st, I honestly thought it would play out differently and then missed my chance to jump on it before it passed 3k...
... and now I'm not willing to buy in until it has another micro correction. Granted I fully believe it has lots more room to grow I just don't see steady growth until the end of time at this rate. I think there was a massive spike in hype over the SegWit outcome and it will likely fall a little before picking back up. Now I just need to be ready when it does... still kicking myself knowing I was ready to buy at 1.9k but because it was so far from Aug 1st I was sure there would be another dip and, well,... I got greedy.
Don't be greedy I suppose.

We're not talking about cellphone plans or car manufacturers... this is mainly for elections. How exactly are we supposed to have people following different leaders and sets of laws if we're all living in the same country with only one slot for president?
I agree one leader, even of one branch of government is stupid. But thats our current system. If you want to discuss alternate forms of societal structure I'm all ears and full of ideas.

I understand what you mean. But couldn't you engineer the option to sell them to other people out of the equation and if anyone did, its a public thing and people would find out. I think that the act of submitting your "ballot" should be done at places like voting centers where your ID is verified again and perhaps a picture taken by the staff if the voter is placed in the online directory to show to the world the face of the person who submitted the "ballot".
Plus the ability to sell the "ballot" to another party... the act of voting for person A or person B would essentially be like selling to person A or person B. There would be no private citizen or entity that could buy them because it would corrupt their authenticity...

I'm sorry for being a dick. hazeBTC's original comment regarding how he votes...


... was somewhat dismissive of my point and in a very baseless way since his position or method of "voting" does not negate the necessity of forcing others with a gun to bend to the majority will. As an example: In his scenario, what would happen to those who vote contrary to him, or does his scenario for some strange reason preclude the possibility of people disagreeing?
And I'm chill as a mothafucking cucumber.
This whole gun to head thing to those who disagree is his idea, I don't even know how he got to that tangent. However isn't it inherent to every society on this planet. Are you guys under the impression that there is a country that does not employ these tactics? I would love to believe it, hell it is my wish that we evolve to that level, but were not there yet.

That's great that you feel that way, I respect your choice, albeit slightly flawed, but whatever.
Most people put up with shit because they are told the majority voted for it and with no way to verify that claim, most people just fall in line.
When you're ready to solve the real problems you can join us in the adult room. Until then... have at it!

Do you mean taking a gun and putting it to someone's head? What are you talking about asshole, bragging about how killing people is cool?
