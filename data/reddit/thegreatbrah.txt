Lots of friends starting to get into crypto. I tell them to do ICOs if they're looking for short term gains with no long term results.

This is good news for bitcoin

I got it now. I like it
@_date: 2014-04-16 09:01:07
Do people just sit around thinking up theories waiting for a rally to share them and try to pump?

Its not. Most people I follow on instagram are tattoo artists with a lot more followers than that. Never heard of this guy and his work isnt terrible exceptional. Incredibly clean linework and solid color saturation but not much outside of that besides fairly traditional designs.
@_date: 2014-03-29 12:19:56
I just made my first bitcoin purchase ever for the itazte starter kit. I didnt see anywhere to input code "reddit" but its fine. Only $5.

@_date: 2014-05-20 16:13:15
What happened with paypal?

Pretty sure anticipation and outcome of government ruling was the main fuel

One artist succeeding in selling lots of units to bitcoin users would likely cause others to accept.

I bought 1 btc yesterday morning. Then I fell back asleep. I had a dream the price dropped to $400. When I woke back up I had bought another in my sleep :(

I hope youre rich
@_date: 2014-01-05 16:09:12
I didnt really think of this before but this could be the market that makes aquiring btc easier. Think of how many people are "gamers" now because of zynga. They made gaming so accessible. I feel like between this and the atms going up this is the year it may really become fully mainstream
@_date: 2014-01-16 00:45:15
Id also like to mention that i started checking coinmap for restaurants and bars in the city that accept bitcoin. As of a few weeks ago it was mainly lawyers offices and other intangible service type companies that  were accepting.
I hadnt found anywhere but i havent checked in a few months. I woukd gladly spend some.money at your establishment if you accepted bitcoin. Not only to support a bitcoin supporter and stimulate the bitcoin economy but to show my friends that its not magical internet money.
If you do start accepting please send me a private message so they i may throw some money at you through the wonder of cryptocurrency.
Also as i mentioned in my other comment: I would gladly come bartend for you. :)

My mother and two aunts were visiting my cousin in nyc from various parts of the world. I live in jersey so I joined them for dinner last night. All of them are over 50 all the way up to over 70. All had at least heard of bitcoin and even had a minor understanding of what it is.

@_date: 2014-03-02 22:34:35
I wouldnt. While travelling I want to get on my flight and I dont want to end up in a secret prison over something fucking stupid.
I want to mention that I do hold bitcoin and I would explain to the TSA agents in simple words that BTC is not physical
@_date: 2014-09-18 22:29:06

A lot of people look to bitcoin as a way of escaping big banks tyranny and apple is deleting every bitcoin wallet app from their appstore. People look at this as an attack on bitcoin. That is what those people are protesting
@_date: 2014-08-16 17:14:00
I know about that site but ive only ever seen one on there. Was hoping to find something else. Thanks though
@_date: 2014-04-26 01:20:00

Thats extremely high. Like probably nobody will pay it typw high
@_date: 2014-04-14 17:29:01
Ill never use gyft again. Bought a $50 card to cvs. Bought a $12 pack of cigarettes with it and it hasnr worked since then and never updated the balance. Still says $50. Doesnt work anymore.

Could be
@_date: 2014-03-13 21:15:09
I get that but as soon as I opened this and hit the menu I felt like I was using the coinbase app. Even if they dont integrate, competition is good.
@_date: 2014-05-08 13:56:46
I wish I got into it then.
@_date: 2014-06-26 14:35:13
What company is this?
Also I asked my local ecig place about bitcoin and the guy behind the counter said money is money
@_date: 2014-03-04 07:49:36
Ive been in since december. Almost bought 2 btc at $500. Oh well

It would make me forget the time they spit in my breadstick sauce.

Im looking to get back in to bartending and I love bitcoin. Do you need any bartenders?
@_date: 2014-02-18 02:39:21
I would be eating it right now
@_date: 2014-04-14 19:07:30
I really dont see how a word in my post lead you to believe I didnt try to use it a second time. If they arent a giftcard management system they shouldnt have an app that looks and acts like it is supposed to be a giftcsrd management system.
I did try to use it a second and third time. Sounds like you are either a hardcore bitcoin fanatic or you work for gyft. Either way sorry for getting you worked up.

What the hell have you been using coinbase for? You have to link an account to buy them. If you havent been buying them what have you been using it for?
@_date: 2014-03-06 00:33:42
But when they arent mining btc anymore what are they mining? I just dontunderstand how they mine when there is nothing to mine. Is it that their systems are what verifies transaction?
@_date: 2014-03-06 00:43:03
Thanks. I understood the whole math thing but I didnt know they the verifications went through them. 
It was confusing to me why the transaction fees went to them but it makes sense now.

Just randomly logged on and saw the guys post about spending 40k and saw the prices. Went to bitcoinwisdom and my mind mind was blown. Probably gonna buy some more soon
@_date: 2015-01-15 22:06:27
The way i see it is if people dont know bitcoin or even if theyve heard of it but know nothing about it have the /r/ in front of it would likely lead them to google it with the /r/ so theyll wind up here instead of a random site. Btw i think im going to make an epic painting of that wizard. Ive been wabting to for months.
@_date: 2015-01-17 16:09:15

How do I check that? I did

I hope its sooner than that I want to cash a bit out for a downpayment on a house
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:33:20
I wasn't suggesting that. Just that it is unbelievable that it's gone so high. When I first heard about Bitcoin, you could get many for a dollar. It would be unimaginable to think it would skyrocket to where it has. Even in the 2013 bubble 10000 didn't seem possible.
@_date: 2015-07-19 05:48:09
about 1.5. not  alot but its a lot to me

I originally wanted to paint it, but lately I've been doing strictly digital. I am happy with it. I am considering color. Here's to the moon boys and girls.
@_date: 2019-04-04 15:04:28
Considered and drew it several times. Not much experience drawing beards. It's a possibility though
@_date: 2015-07-19 06:02:15
What kind of connection would i need to connect it to a monitor?
@_date: 2019-04-04 14:42:20

Hey thanks so much

That's not the point I was trying to make. The other poster said online banking took off fast but I feel like cheques have been around for well over a hundred years before credit cards and online anything. So I'm just wondering why other countries may not have had them
@_date: 2018-03-02 14:20:22
Sitting on a nest egg is a pretty common bank analogy...
Anyways I'm not hodling anymore. I am hachting

Not all merchants. Last time it was Microsoft etc. Whenever the price goes down big ones drop it. 
@_date: 2018-03-04 02:00:02
Id like to think 50k is soon but I imagine low teens for at least a few years. Basing that on previous trends and I hope I'm wrong. 
@_date: 2019-01-24 05:55:11
This has definitely been a thing for along time
@_date: 2018-03-27 19:46:46
Not saying you're wrong but every time the price drops merchants drop it. 
@_date: 2019-01-02 02:52:44
I bet somebody that it would hit 25000 by end of 2018. I owe him some money

I literally don't even remember the last time I owned a checkbook 
@_date: 2018-03-26 15:19:58
Do other countries not use checks? Or do they just call them something different?

I'd be pretty well off if I wasn't skittish when I started. Just hodl til you want out on your own accord
@_date: 2017-10-08 21:36:30
But where should I keep it to benefit from both?
@_date: 2018-03-25 23:38:45
That's interesting. Upon reading your comment I did realize I sent my rent checks up until 2015. Feels like a lifetime ago though.
@_date: 2017-10-09 04:05:48
I use mycellium but I don't recall ever having bch show up in there?
@_date: 2018-03-26 17:31:56
Yeah but I mean cheques have been around for a very very long time before mobile banking
@_date: 2018-07-26 13:59:04
Oh yeah? Well I joined early December 2013 so I was first 100k!
@_date: 2018-07-14 07:53:53
I just went to Amazon. I will have it on my server book from now on. Wish I thought of it years ago. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 21:32:29
How do you make it so you get both?
@_date: 2017-10-24 04:17:49
This is what I don't get...how the heck do I actually access my bch or bitcoin gold? i use mycellium and found instructions to extract them through coinami which didnt work. I want to be able to access my forked coins. Nobody seems to ever answer this question fo rme
@_date: 2018-07-26 14:20:56
Im 33 and work with lots of 20 to 25 year olds. Some don't even have facebook but those who do barely use it.
Snapchat mostly and Instagram is what they do. I think facebook owns those though. They both have ads now. Its annoying but not as bad as facebook
@_date: 2018-07-12 23:56:01
It is definitely the northeast.
@_date: 2018-07-12 23:54:54
I would be happy to accept bitcoin tips at work. Actually I'm going to order a bitcoin sticker for my server book. Anyone know a good place to get one?
@_date: 2015-04-30 14:22:20
@_date: 2018-07-26 13:57:29
It will be back there soon enough I'm sure.
@_date: 2015-04-08 16:36:05
the simple answer is yes. Yes it could fail.
@_date: 2017-10-31 23:35:09
Why is 7000 more of an indicator than 6000? 
@_date: 2017-05-11 15:26:26
Well that was fun. Thank you
@_date: 2017-05-11 15:28:58
I think we've passed the point of dropping that low again. Could always be wrong but that's my thoughts
@_date: 2017-05-26 17:28:54
so why not do that? my 6000 doge is like 3 dollars now
@_date: 2017-05-11 20:36:42
Nothing in my posts suggests that I was saying that. Simply stating what the past has shown us
@_date: 2017-05-11 20:15:55
I would call it 1200 but could be 800 as that lasted much longer. 
@_date: 2015-03-24 17:19:56
@_date: 2017-07-14 20:01:31
I meant mycellium.

Whats the box?
@_date: 2017-07-27 21:23:29
Patience and hodling. Not just for bitcoin for my other stocks as well. Would be backed out of several if I hadn't been here first.
I didn't start investing until after I bought my first btc.
@_date: 2017-07-14 17:35:27
So I have been into bitcoin since 2013 but I do not understand what's happening. Is segwit the right answer? Is this fork definitely happening? I'm using mycellium. Am I going to be on the wrong side of this?
@_date: 2017-06-26 21:58:04
What a dork. I'm 32. Not a kid by any means. You are just an asshole
@_date: 2017-06-26 19:48:55
Nah not really at all. You are just a giant dickhead. We were talking about different apps we use. What we buy. What our strategies were. Bitcoin is a part of my investments so I brought it up. Go be a dick somewhere else you dick

Do you live around the tristate area. Id get a tattoo from you just so i could pay with btc. I know this isnt a common thing for tattoo artists but would you consider a discount for bitcoin payments?
@_date: 2013-11-28 17:06:24
Yeah my original btc was purchased through cashintocoins. I also had to wait to buy more. Woke up the morning my first coinbase purchase cleared and i was good to go!

It will be the amount you input that you would like to buy at the conversion rate at the time you press the buy button. It is safe to an extent but the offline/paper wallets are always safest. I dont have much so i keep mine in coinbase. Make sure 2 factor authentication or whatever its called is enabled
@_date: 2013-12-18 12:30:11
People were asking for this asfter the price increase too

Go to buy/sell. Select buy. They wont be there for a few days and you cant buy more until your first transaction goes through. Id buy as much as you want in the first go. Because it will take days. Just bought like thirty minutes ago and they said it wont be there until next friday. This is after ive already purchased.
@_date: 2013-12-03 05:15:53
Somebody posted this a week ago with the exact same reply from them. I guess the more people show interest the better
@_date: 2013-11-18 12:47:54
The first link in your message isnt working for me which i assume is the link either to deposit information or to the page to actually deposit. I wouldnt mind buyng from you even though your asking price is high you seem yo have pretty legit feedback. Please relink so i may buy from you

Is there a way to purchase coin through the atm or just for withdrawals? Iwas in the city last night wishing there was an atm or store accepting it as payment where i was so i could show my friend how it works. I come through the port authority so times square would be convenient for me. Also i think if you put a btc atm in times square that it will be worldwide news
Edit: smartphone spelling
@_date: 2013-11-18 07:49:27
Went to coinbase using chase.
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:23:45
If anyone you onow asks you about bitcoin one of the most important things to tell them is that it is for purchasing things. Coinmap.org is a good place to find physical places to make purchases with bitcoin and there are tens of thousands of places to buy online
@_date: 2013-11-18 08:13:48
How does this work. Make the request then go to the bank in the morning and deposit to cashintocoins account?

Mark my words: when this happens and there is a front page post about it there is going to be a huge backlash from christianity about one world currency and the mark of the beast etc. It will probably makes its way to the mainstream

I figure beginning to middle of this week will be the first serious boom. Takes several days to get account verified for a mildly tech savvy person not to mention people who wanted to do serious research before getting in.

If only man
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:43:37
While this is true some banks, like chase, fo not allow this. Although i think with a credit csrd instant verification maybe be possible also.
@_date: 2013-11-20 03:00:35
I know. I am currently waiting on the transactions.
@_date: 2013-12-08 15:08:58
I think closing the account snd providing the reason is a good idea
@_date: 2013-11-25 07:18:22

Cashintocoins.com is coming up as a nonexistant website?
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:32:09
I hope when my transactions finally go through its at an all time low and then people hearing it on the mainstream news buy and make me rich

I wont downvote. Its possible you are right. We will see
@_date: 2013-11-28 12:49:57
Id trade in something to get started. Also it takes time to get verified so dont wait to sign up at an exchange until you have cash in hand. You should at least do that much
@_date: 2013-11-27 13:39:46
No but maybe today
@_date: 2013-11-26 20:37:54
Does this start at midnight est?

Haha awesome man thank you so much. That was very kind of you! I could send you an address...lol. Enjoy the good life. I cant wait until the day comes when I can do the same and if it takes a hundred years I hope my grandchildren appreciate what they have!
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:38:41
Sadly your account will need to be verified which will take a few days. Verify bank account then start buying
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:36:52
Thanks very much!
