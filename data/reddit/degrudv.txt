Get her one. It'll pay for her entire coin collection.

Thanks. I gave them their own wallets. They're not sure what to do with it but they were elated nonetheless.
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:16:37
Oh, Damn. you're probably right. Didn't thunk about that. I'm on it. Thanks. 
@_date: 2018-05-17 02:35:36
Hope you have cold storage.

This feels like Satoshi Nakamoto signing off for the last time. 
@_date: 2019-03-31 03:00:00
Wait, I thought this was a joke. 
@_date: 2018-10-18 13:31:41
She seems rather excited about being stuck with the bill.
@_date: 2018-10-09 17:53:03
Of course I do.  You put in carefully selected search terms then the magic Google Elves gather the documents and display them for you on the internet machine. Its pretty straight forward. 
@_date: 2018-10-26 01:51:37
She's hot. That girl on the left is cute too.

Ok, so it wasn't August 1st. I was wondering why the market had little to no reaction on August 2nd. What day did it lock in?

Fractional reserve

Nope. There's not. That's why it's really hard to take these seriously. I've been on this subreddit for almost 3 years now and I cant tell you how many of these "whales are coming" posts I've seen. 
And let's accurately define a whale in the Bitcoin world.  Its not some savvy investor or investment firm. Sure, maybe some of those exist but most "whales" accumulated their wealth by letting their gaming PC mine coin while they weren't using it. 8 years later what was $23.17 is now worth millions. That's not an investment guru with an uncanny ability to read TA charts.  That's a guy that found a lottery ticket.

Checked the blockexplorer. You haven't donated yet.
@_date: 2017-09-07 01:39:05
Yeah, came across it today. Funny to look back and see what they were saying.  BTC was about $600 back then. Ignoring them made you a small fortune.
@_date: 2017-09-27 18:48:47
No disrespect meant. Just thought it was cool.
@_date: 2017-09-04 18:21:31
And this whole time I thought Mario was Satoshi Nakamoto. That guy has been mining bitcoin since the early 80's.
 
@_date: 2017-09-07 01:35:29
No FUD here.  Exactly the opposite.  Point is you made a 850% return if you invested in BTC when this came out saying not to.

Hyperdeflation is arguably just as dangerous as hyperinflation. Instead of your money becoming worthless because there's more of it in circulation, hyperdeflation makes it worth more because there's less of it. That may sound good but think about the ramifications. If you know your money is going to be worth more tomorrow then why would you spend it today? When everybody takes that approach, very few items are bought or sold. For the most part businesses come to a halt and a once thriving economy stalls out. Now I'm a hodler too so I'm with you, but I think it's important to realize hyperdeflation can be just as devastating to any economy as hyperinflation.

I'm really confused by this whole thing. I have 1 BTC from before BCC so I have both but what do I need to do with my paper wallet? Any help would be greatly appreciated. 
@_date: 2017-09-26 20:30:24
What do you do where you feel comfortable wearing Adidas shoes in first class?
@_date: 2017-10-26 11:33:46
I thought paper wallets made offline were the absolute safest way to store coins. Can you explain a safer method?
@_date: 2017-10-05 16:01:30
Oh, so it's really not a fair analogy then. Gotcha. Thanks. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 02:07:43
Thanks for the reply.  Is bitaddress.org considered a segregated witness wallet or can it not be a paper wallet? (I feel dumb for asking these questions)
@_date: 2018-04-18 02:12:52
Are yall not concerned that there are clearly central hubs forming here? I'm still in but that's kind of what people were warning about happening. 
@_date: 2018-12-02 17:51:36
Pfft.  A man who claims to visit every house in the entire world in one night calls a 7k bitcoin unrealistic. 
Oh, by christmas?!?  Yeah, Santa's right sweetheart.

We're now in the Endgame.
