Most of these responses are wrong.  
The key point here is when you actually have control of these assets.  With the multipool situation, you never had control of them (i.e. in your wallet that has your private key).  You only recognize the value when you take possession of the asset.  If you don't have 'possession' of the asset you cannot be taxed on it.  Therefore, people could defer taxation and store their coins in pools and cash out when it makes sense for them (i.e. when the value is low)

I got a tracking number sent to my e-mail from UPS.  Here is a snippit of the text:  
Sweden	 10/02/2013	 8:26 A.M.	Order Processed: Ready for UPS
Louisville, KY, United States	 10/03/2013	 7:32 A.M.	Registered with Clearing Agency. Shipment release pending Clearing Agency review. / Released by Clearing Agency. Now in-transit

Accountant here - This is wrong.  The concept of realized versus unrealized gains/losses applies.  You don't have to report unrealized holding gains / losses.  It works the same as buying and holding stock.

I looked up the customs duties online before buying the device (i tend to over-research everything).  I will end up owing 0 bucks to uncle sam as it falls under the computer and related equipment class of goods.  I should owe like 40 bucks to UPS for their import duties.

Just wanted to say congrats!  I have a miner coming tomorrow so I can answer all of these GH/S questions.

This seems to be a great service and fairly straightforward.  Have you considered providing a PDF with some encrypted QR codes instead of storing it as a browser link?  Mycelium does an amazing job of this to keep your data safe.  Would be very helpful to just print out a transaction with all of the relevant details as opposed to saving it in some obscure location.

asset would be fully impaired and written off (fully depreciated)

Yes - I had the exact same thing happen and now the transaction is in mediation.  I highly suggest all others check their credit card statements.

UPS cost about 140 bucks.  I have had my miner for 11 days.

I sympathize with you - I was VERY close to getting the hosting option but decided against it after I called UPS (they told me it would take 2 days and they were right on).  Who knows, maybe KNC will provide some sort of compensation as a 'sorry we didn't get you all hashing as soon as we expected'.  At least they didnt BFL people - they managed to stick to their time table remarkably well, considering all of the things that could have gone wrong.

How are you paying for the purchases?  In BTC?  In USD?  You would likely have to self report in the event the purchase was paid for in BTC, as there arent many dealerships / mortgage brokers that take BTC.  At some point, you'll need to hand them a check in USD and in order to get that USD, you are going to need to sell the BTC. This is the date you would use to calculate your gain.
The situation is complicated if you are paying in BTC using something like bitpay.

Unfortunately, credit card companies do NOT protect the consumers ability to return on investment.  Any mention of ROI and your claim probably goes out the window.  The best way to get your money back is to stick to the facts - they have failed to deliver a product you paid for.  End of story

This is exactly why we need clarity from the IRS.  If you are paying for the lunch in BTC, then I really don't know - my intuition would say probably using the rate that was established at the time of the transaction.  The problem here is that as transactions become voluminous - it is extremely difficult and cumbersome to account for. If you are exchanging for USD before paying the vendor, then certainly.

This rig (a KNC Jupiter) hashes around 575 GH/s and uses something like 750 to 800 watts.  You can expect around 2 bitcoins a day at current difficulty.

I can't wait to see the section related to mining income.  I am likely going to report it as a business operation - with all of the same considerations.  That means that equipment associated with the activity can be depreciated accordingly.  The only problem is what depreciation method to use - IT assets typically have a useful life of about 5 years, so a units of production method may be the best way to depreciate the asset.

The current tax law isn't clear on how bitcoins should be treated yet - so take everything people say with a grain of salt.  If you wanted to be conservative (which is a good idea in this case), you would have to self report sales tax (depending on the purchase and dependent on if the merchant collected the tax up front or not).  You would also have to recognize capital gains similar to the way that described below.  How likely is the IRS to be able to track you down and audit you if you mined BTC and bought something in BTC, but didn't pay capital gains/sales tax?  Probably less likely than catching people for use tax fraud... but the chance is not 0.
