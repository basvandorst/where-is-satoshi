Set buys at points of previous resistance - 7.5K for a start, if you're not gagging to buy at the current price.

I disagree. For me it feels worse being down than up. At least when you've sold and made some profits, even if that original coin keeps going up, you still have the opportunity to use those profits to get into something else. When you're holding through a dip you can't do shit but hope it goes back up.

Whatever your budget, maybe spend half now (if you're happy with this price) and put the other half on a limit order at a lower price?

If you buy 1 coin at 8K USD and its value than drops to 1K USD, then you have 1 coin worth 1K USD...
