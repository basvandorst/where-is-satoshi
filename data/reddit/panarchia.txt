What gives anyone the right to decide there should be a vote? Who designs the voting system? Who decides what the options are? What right do those who vote for the winning proposal have to forcibly impose the outcome on others irrespective of consent?

Try and find out.

I dont vote, never will, and I evade taxes. Actively.

Ah, something else I thought of: you will probably have some disputes when it comes to returns and stuff. Consider using  for cheap internet arbitration to resolve disputes that you cant resolve on your own. Using the judge.me clause is free- only actual use of the arbitration costs money. (and its cheap)

Irony is ironic.

Why is democracy good? How is taxation peaceful? Taxes aren't donations. Taxes help the state, not you.

OK I must admit defeat here and concede that you are right. You have demonstrated that you have the legitimate right to impose debt on me without my consent, forcibly collect it,  and murder me if I resist. Thanks, I dont know what I was thinking.

Like what? And how?

No worries, thanks for the quick reply =)
On a side note, you should consider using PGP for orders. Just put your public key on your website and let customers provide you with theirs. This provides strong protection from prying eyes.

No roads would be built. There would be a supermarket over there, your house over there, some cars spread out randomly. And everyone would just stand there, scratching their heads.

Everyone likes nice things. Where does the right to force others to pay for the nice things you want come from? And the right to murder those who resist?
