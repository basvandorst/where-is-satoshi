Reading Atlas Shrugged right now, and all the heroism of her characters revolves around hilariously suspect science, for example:
1. An alloy that is lighter, cheaper, stronger, more durable than steel (In a capitalist society, why is a material that is superior in every way to steel cheaper than steel?)
2. Oil from shale economically (not yet been done)
3. Power from static electricity in atmosphere (wut)
4. Acoustic weapon based on cosmic rays (wut)
Now you might come out and say, "Hey, that doesn't matter, it's not a science fiction book." I disagree, the greatness of her (flat, unreal) characters stems from ridiculous (and some hilariously misunderstood) ideas of science. She depended on the readers not questioning her science because of her confidence in the way she wrote it. In her own fantasy land where this stuff works, her ideas also work. The real world is not her fantasy world.

I saw one of his videos. Good god, the amount of time he spends beating around  the bush and being condescending is unbelievable. His 30 minute videos can be condensed down to possibly two small paragraphs of text, and you get the added benefit of not having to listen to his voice.

Without the exaggerations, they become normal people, and hence not good enough to be in Galt's gulch.
PS: Why is a superior material cheaper? Is he being altruistic?

Asimov wasn't pushing a crazy philosophy, and in his ideas are plausible at the very minimum.

Yes, I will be testing with a few satoshis before I actually move all my coins into storage.

How have you escaped Windows tax if you paid even more money to not have it?
Edit: I'm not very bright.

If you remove the specialness of their achievements, what's so special about them? It's quite clear that anyone who is invited to Galt's gulch isn't a normal person. 
The computer I'm writing on is the result of a market abused by Intel (antitrust lawsuits, can provide links if needed). Intel's unregulated activities are what caused AMD's decline, and which is why you no longer see the pace of improvements that the mid 2000s saw. While Intel and AMD were competing fairly, prices fell while performance went up. Now prices remain static, performance gets mild bump ups.
The internet I use to send this is also not dropping in price, because there isn't a free market. Each provider has carved out a monopoly in parts of the US and in the absence of any real regulation, are free to abuse their customers as they please.
The "gentleman's" agreement between silicon valley companies that has been making the news lately also comes to mind. Their leaders are all proponents of the free market, but extremely happy to not compete themselves.
It's quite clear that companies (IRL) have stacked markets by colluding with each other and bribing the government too. Rand makes it a point to castigate every instance where one of her villains bribes government, yet mentions Dagny bribing officials to get permissions for the John Galt line in passing, and that's okay.
While I can agree with some of Rand's ideas (e.g. Galt's gulch is a lot like Chomsky's essay on socialist libertarianism, which I think is a good system), it's the characters that make it hard for me to agree with her in general. Like I said initially, her characters are unrealistically perfect. Beyond that (and this is something someone else mentioned in this thread) the villains are also extremely perfect in their lack of perfection. He world isn't realistic, and so I hesitate to apply her ideas to the real world.

I see... That wasn't very smart of me.

Ah, excellent, this is just what I'm looking for. Thanks!

I see. Is there a way to put messages on the blockchain?

I will test this later today.

Yeah someone pointed that out. I've edited my post.
@_date: 2014-07-08 14:43:59
I see. That makes sense. Thanks!

I'd read that they were identical beneath the covers, that's why the differing results puzzled me. People have pointed out though that the process of generating a random encrypted key and encrypting an existing key are different, so it's clearer now.
Both sites are awesome, thanks for the great work!

Here is an example of an LED used to transmit information. Modders wanted to change the firmware of Canon cameras, managed to get the LED to blink out the entire firmware, which was then read by a photodiode connected to a sound card.
