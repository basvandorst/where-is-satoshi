Will it ever reach a point of a currency and not an investment?

But it doesn't address the volatility.

The point I'm trying to make though is it's so volatile, why accept it as a payment. 2017 it was worth 4k then 19k then 12k then 6k. Why put yourself at risk.

They have a way of tracking sales though? I don't think I understand the point you are trying to make.

Can someone explain to me why a company would accept btc as a a form of payment? They still pay transaction fees, never know if it will change value dramatically before they cash out. Etc.. doesn't make sense to me. Please enlighten me.

It's 100% illegal for them to not report the sale. Tax fraud n shit.

Do you think it'll ever reach a form that will allow it to be a legitimate currency and not an investment or shady business?

Definitely didn't. I bought in at 3000. There really wasn't all that much hype to it at the time (compared to November/December). 
The lack/surplus of hype doesn't necessarily sway my thoughts on it. I have very little belief in Bitcoin and it's future success. 
No offense to anyone on this sub, but a lot of what is posted seems like desperate attempts to stay positive. "X country is considering using bitcoin", "X state may accept bitcoin", "X company is looking into bitcoin as a currency they will accept for goods". The only things that have actually occurred have been companies rejecting bitcoin as a payment option. Steam, Microsoft, New Egg, etc. 
If it stops being accepted as a form of payment, then it is no longer a currency. It is simply an asset that people hold.

To your first point, at what point will bitcoin be too expensive for companies to accept them straight without having to be converted to some sort of fiat currency? You used to be able to use gold coins, but due to their rise in price, it isn't viable for a company to accept them outright. (Probably am wrong about this thought)
Second point, I don't think it'll ever become a closed user base. If it does, then the currency will die.

1. Yes bitcoins will continue to be mined and released, but in the coming years the rate will go to 100's released, so it will not be a high enough release to keep the market alive just on that alone. 
2. The miners are only making money if there are transactions to be made. Once transactions stop, the money stops. 
3. I am not describing that what-so-ever. I am saying it becomes too valuable to hold in, trading it is crazy, because no amount you could sell it or trade it for will account for the amount in future growth it will have. On the front page of r/bitcoin, some guy was going on about never trading your bitcoin you will regret it, hold onto them. 
4. I am not saying everyone will hold onto them. But if ~20% 
of the holders start a trend of never spending a single bitcoin and just holding them, that immediately takes 20% of all bitcoins out of circulation. If there are 20 million, we are left with 16 million coins. So every coin just became inherently more valuable. So this same 20% starts telling people to hold onto their bitcoins because they are going to skyrocket. 5% of the users are convinced and they start holding. The 20% grows to 25% and presumably they will begin purchasing more and more coins, but lets just say they buy an additional 5% of all coins in circulation. We now have 30% of all bitcoins out of commission. As said above, people may lose or abandon their coins, but that is probably less than 1% of all coins so I'll leave that out. We are left with 14 million coins. People will begin to be wary of trading them because of the price steadily increasing due to the decreasing number of coins in true circulation. They will still be traded, but with less frequency for sure. Then mining becomes less profitable because fewer and fewer people are making transactions. I'm not saying it will take all coins out of circulation, but it is easy to see how we could lose 50% of all coins due to holders over time. IF this were to happen, it stops being a realistic to spend them
