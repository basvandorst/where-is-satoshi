Put me in that boat too.

This is the way I see it, tell me if it's a correct analogy.
I imagine that when mining, a computer is looking for a prime number. The numbers are so big that it takes a while. And each prime number is a bitcoin.
That's the way I see it, but what I don't get is that once it's been found whats not stopping anyone else from mining that same "prime number" (if my analogy makes sense)?

For two cards I would recommend more than 700W but it is enough, especially if you aren't going with any extra peripherals. A 1000W will be enough for 3 too.

I think I might buy 50$ worth of bitcoins and sit on those. 
I really want to just try selling and buying. Yesterday 1 SBC was at .0001 BTC and went up to .0002 BTC in 1 hour. Had I bought SBC and sold it again, I would be at 40$ right now.

Gosh you are like those one in a million redditors that is so nice and understanding. Hope you get help with that roof!

Thing is, I think a lot of people that are going to buy in the next 24hrs count on selling in the next 48hrs.

Ah, true. I would go for the best cooling in this case, if there is a difference in brand it will be minimal.

Haven't had to go through that yet, have just been meddling around with BTC I deposited. 
Not too excited to test it out either, hopefully when the time comes and I want to withdraw, they'll have some simpler option. Interac would be amazing.

Really like what you do! 
Just two months ago I was debating buying a couple bitcoins,  when they were aroun 250$... but I didn't. Now I'm in love with bitcoins... trying to find out everything I can about them. 
How do you deal with the bitcoin fluctuations? Do you repeatedly change your prices?

I'm actually having a lot of fun mining alt coins. I made around 20$ yesterday selling my coins for bitcoins. Soon I'm going to try just buying and selling repeatedly, I'll see where that takes me, haha.

So why not loose something I made from no investments? I think its best that I loose everything now rather than when I invest a lot, learn a cheap lesson, see what I mean?

Nope sorry. A quick Google search might help.

Thanks! This makes way more sense, I appreciate that you took the time to elaborate instead of just telling me I'm completely wrong.

This is what I'm using... simple sign up, just require one piece of ID and one proof of residence (bank statement worked for me).
