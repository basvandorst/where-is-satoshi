It's was not a back street deal, they hold I assume the the bitcoins, my account was credited with the bit coins, they will transfer in to nominated bank account in what ever currency I want.

Now have all the original paper work to hand , what I have is £750 converted to $1200 ( about right for 2011) he paid me in 1200 bitcoins, so the I have 1200 bitcoins. 
The bank are having me collected at 8am in the morning to go to the banks main office to do the paper work for the sale and transfer. 
I've not yet done the maths, but omg what can I say ?

Guys, I'm having a bit of a break down here, I'll get back to you.

Update, it's all sorted, the bitcoins are held in an account at a bank/asset management company, I have the bank account details and it's only a matter of presenting my self at one of their offices with my ID (standard banking and money laundering practise) and transferring the funds. 
Not a clue exactly how many bitcoins I have, due to security they can not tell me over the telephone but I think I have 820. 
Thanks for your help guys, will post a few snap shots when I transfer the money .

No seriously, it was not a thing i have since given any thought to. Busy lives and all that

I'm assuming I've missed some thing , only now looking at the current value. That in no way can be correct.

Just also to say, back in 2011 it was £750, I don't live my life to the point that £750 was that important to me, I gave it no more thought than I do to company pension I paid into for 4 months 30 years ago.

If and I'm sure he did give me a wallet I will have the details. It was no back street deal, a bit strange at the time but the guy was high in financial services industry.  Dude, as I said I'm out of my knowledge zone, I'm still in contact with the guy (he's on my FB) I have messaged him.

Have no idea. Tbh so far out of any knowledge base I have. Obviously not being a stupid person I will take professional legal advise.
