mycellium charged me 10 us to transfer 52us ��

LOL using too low makes the transaction useless with the fees floating Soo high, as of late the lowest economic fee is at least 240sat/b 
It's useless too use low priority or economic can last up to 3 days to confirm 
actually staying that I don't know how to use it justifies the fact that ppl are not aware that in the last 4 weeks the fees are sky high

lol I tried it and waited 72hrs to confirm
@_date: 2017-11-18 19:35:21
actually the lowest possible would have been like 7.40 us and the waiting for confirmations on that fee would have been at least 24 hours

didn't refer to lending cryptos just referred to the banks in this area that a personal loan is at 25% interest rate, money is really expensive here and most of it inaccessible by the way of the banks here, cuz of the high interest rates
this happens even with the CC fees they are realllllly expensive here

well actually we are accepting bitcoins and Ethereum in a lot of places in the whole island (DR and Haiti)
we don't tend to love central banks too much in the island and cryptos are offering a new ordeal of things that weren't possible before like not being tied to banks and their stupid fees and abnormal rates

we have ATMs here of BTC, some ppl store value on BTC and it's used for P2P between private persons.
Not all business here actually get tangled with cryptos in general hence the central bank prohibited the use of them has a legal tender for payments and so

advantages that are unknown for most of the population here but people are starting to read and learn, education is important for the right usage and implementation of the benefits that cryptos in general will have here, wouldn't have said it better mate

nevertheless he's making a point regarding intrinsic/dumb value that we give to material things itself, e.g. gold or bitcoin, doesn't matter what is why
@_date: 2017-10-04 23:05:02

@_date: 2017-10-13 17:08:04
