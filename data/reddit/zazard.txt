My words were chosen poorly. I mean : The taxes you pay, pay for these. So as long as your taxes are paid, you are entitled to benefit from them "for free" (or more precisely "for no further cost"). My point stays mostly the same, though.


I like to hope so too, even with the grim view on human goodwill I exhibited in my previous posts.
But I also think that doing these, on the large scale of a human society, would REQUIRE some form of logistics, planning, supervision, etc ... that is not doable without a central entity. So, we would form entities to handle roads, for example. Then to handle utilities. Then fire departments. Etc ... And all those entities, in the end, would probably end up being all fused in one central entity responsible for all of these. Entity which you would, obviously, have to pay for, because otherwise it would not be able to fund anything that it does for you. Doesn't that sound like a government with a taxation system ? Does to me. (of course, I'm simplifying, I know it's more complex than this, but for the subject issue, i.e taxes, it's relevant)

Okay, I'll rephrase : 
If you protest the system as a whole, then you should **strive to** live **as** apart from it **as you possibly can**.
Would you agree with this ?

I'm all for that, but it is very much like what exists : Everyone pays for things everyone is entitled to use.
Of course, there is abuse, and a lot of it, but that's just a by-product of a centralized system. Again, I'm ok with people who don't contribute to the system because they don't want to use it. It's people who take but do not give that I have a problem with.

I am truly shocked by the fact that so many people here seem to sincerely advocate the fact that, in a society, not paying taxes is okay.
I hope this doesn't catch on too much. I don't really like the thought of a world where there is no entity (govt, here) that takes care of public utilities and services like roads, public education, firemen, police, etc ... just because nobody wants to pay for it. Because let's be real, that's what taxes are for.
Of course, you can use the argument that most of the taxes go to questionable destinations, like funding wars etc ... and you would be right. But don't forget this : If the government does not collect taxes, there is no money to take care of the infrastructures and essential services.
**News flash : If you don't pay for it, you're not entitled to use it.**
Please remember that Bitcoin was not, in fact, a tool designed to help you avoid the IRS or whatever organism handles taxes in your country. It was designed to keep more sinister government actions from touching your wealth, and to preserve your privacy. Don't go putting censorship, bank shenanigans and outright theft in the same basket as taxes, which are actually a legitimate way for a society to take care of things that benefit everyone.
Edit : Removing unwarranted insults.

Okay then, it you're not a part of it, then I have no objection whatsoever to what you do / want to do. But are you truly not a part from anything that you protest ?


Sorry about that. It was indeed an unbased assumption, I need to stop using generalities.


You may notice that I'm not actually saying that the system is well-made, or run by competent / incorruptible people. I have had my fair share of unfair treatment by the system, and am also fed up with bureaucrats. But aren't we all, on some level ?
I was actually saying, on the topic of taxes, that if you don't pay for them, then, logically, you are not entitled to anything your government provides for you. That's all !

I don't want to sound mean here, so please forgive in advance anything that sounds aggressive (English isn't my native language and I sometimes can not find "softer" ways to say things)
To use the example of the public infrastructure (again, I know) : Isn't having roads, police/fire departments, etc ... available to you for free enough of an incentive to you ?
Again, I agree with the fact that taxes are, nowadays, mostly used for "defense" (Note the quotes), which I also think is mostly unwarranted (Real defense is, but not at this magnitude, and agression is completely unwarranted in my opinion. But hey, debatable). But you are equivocating paying taxes to being a barbaric warmonger.
I would also agree to say that everything I'm putting as a benefit of taxes could be funded by voluntarism, eliminating the need for a centralized government altogether.
But I also think that :
* That would be giving way too much credit to the good will of the average human. Deep down, most of us are self-centered jerks, and if asked to contribute a fraction of our income to the community, most of us would just say "fuck off", and everyone would live in a medieval world. (Again, not saying I don't want to help, but that I think most of us would, if faced with the choice, not do it.)
* Wanting to change the way things are is all well and good, but I also think that people who do not actively try to change things in real life in meaningful ways do not deserve the right to rant about it on the Internet. As someone said in this thread, "Get involved and change the system, move out, or pay up.".
Again, if you're living in a civilised country, taking advantage of all that it offers, and refuse to contribute to it "just because", you're basically a worthless freeloader, contribute nothing to the community, and deserve to be booted out of it. We'll see how you'd fare with no help whatsoever.

Dude. Condescending much ?
@_date: 2013-03-20 17:22:44
Could have more of an effect if everyone did, ok.
But consider this : If you don't pay, but still use as much as everyone else, how are you not shafting your fellow man in the process ? Unless, of course, you consider that anyone who still pays doesn't deserve your respect or anything.
To sum it up : If you take, you logically have to give. Or else you are, basically, well, a freeloader.

Interesting points. Just want to point out two things :
* I don't live in the US, so I wouldn't know about their way of doing things. I won't comment on that :)
* Yes, if you want the system to fundamentally and radically change, protesting may be the way of doing things. But understand that, again, if you protest the system as a whole, you should live apart from it. Anything else would be hypocrisy.
@_date: 2013-03-20 17:20:22
Does indeed sound grim for citizens of the USA.
@_date: 2013-03-20 17:16:49


Yes. Chalk that up to my bad temper. Sorry about this.
I'll read up on these. But in the meantime, could you please elaborate on this specific subject, i.e how, according to what you say, public utilities (in a broad sense) are not funded by taxes ?
@_date: 2013-03-20 17:15:04
Okay then. As I said to some others, if you are legitimately convinced that the system is flawed, and that as a consequence you choose to completely live apart from it, I have no problem whatsoever with your choices.
But do you truly live apart from it, completely ? Because that is, in my opinion, what's required to be able to say that you don't pay for the system without being a hypocrit. No offense intended.
