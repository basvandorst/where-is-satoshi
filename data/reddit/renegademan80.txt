I thought it was absolutely fabulous! Very entertaining and funny!

I listened to the Soundcloud back up audio version. I couldn't hear anything being discussed that warrants YT removing it. Very strange. Something quite untoward about this. I'm still of the opinion that what happened to BitPay reeks of a setup or inside job. In 2015 when even a regular business user has known for at least 15 years that regular email is insecure and you should never open links unless you're sure of the sender (and even then the email could be from a hack or virus) it beggars belief people running a crypto outfit like BitPay were so easily scammed. Ridiculous and hardly surprising the insurers are refusing to pay out.

That is indeed a big deal. Many of them on the BCT DRK thread are experiencing sub 5 second transactions. That's totally competitive with credit cards at a fraction of the cost! It makes it entirely possible to use crypto for POS without some sort of intermediary (like BitPay).
