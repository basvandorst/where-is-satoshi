The improvement on censorship resistance is the greatest one since the adoption of double entry accounting during the 16th century, which allowed the emergence of corporations and large scale world trade.
What this improvement on transaction immutability will contribute to world trade remains to be seen, but in my view it will deliver a dramatic reduction in the cost of trust, especially on international trade and this will allow many new business to exist which today are not possible due to the aforementioned cost of trust.

I believe that most people that support regulating bitcoin do not realize this.   They think is the good thing to do for the same reason they support banning drugs.     The problem is that they ignore Bastiat (the seen and unseen).

Of course, fiat system could and will collapse. Mainly because is based on undetermined debt (not redeemable for a specific good). But apart from that my point is that Bitcoin does not need a complex legal system in order to have value. This is important for countries which lack from a developed and sound legal system.

Within the context of Bitcoin decentralization (indeed distribution more than decentralizacion), together with the consensus algorithm, is how immutability is achieved.

A legal system helps the creditor in many ways.  For example ensuring that the debtor can only default if he is really broke.  A legal system also helps ensuring that the creditor still can get the collateral of the loan, if there is any.

No.  I dont think at all that electricity expenditure is wasteful.  On the opposite I believe it is totally worth it.

Yes, but if you read the post, the criticism of Keith Weiner is, what if a new technology is able to provide an immutable ledger without the reward mechanism?
@_date: 2018-06-15 16:29:13
I would be very interested if you could provide solid arguments on why such technology is impossible.  Maybe based on the CAP theorem?  Honestly I am not smart enough to develop such a rebuttal.

I dont know.  But shitcoins are very good for Bitcoin.  They take the risk, and Bitcoin will be able to take the benefits, if any.

The concept of money (understood as not anyone else´s liability) has been around for millenia.   The concept of credit-currency not so much.
When credit-currency was discovered, it improved money because it was much more easier (cheaper) to transfer, because credit is information while gold or silver are physical goods.
The essence of Bitcoin is not being money but digital money.   Digital money that is not anyone else´s liability.   Digital money did not exist until Bitcoin was invented.   And since Bitcoin invention money is as easy to transfer as credit.  I believe we both agree this is huge.
Regarding austrian economics, yes and no.   Mises´s theory of money does absolutely not explain Bitcoin (I wrote about it here: 
You have to go back to Menger and then fast forward to Carlos Bondone (Austrian-Mengerian) to find a monetary theory that explains Bitcoin.

Bitcoin was also a fantasy before it was invented.   Nevertheless the post is a theoretical exercise to refute a criticism to Bitcoin.   There are two ways of refuting the criticism:  
1/Showing that new technology would not harm but strengthen Bitcoin (that´s what I tried in my post)
2/Provide a reaoned explanation on why that technology is not possible
Just denying the possibility of that technology does not refute the criticism.

Are you sure? I challenge you to name me just one example of digital money **that is not anyone else´s liability or obligation**.

Three more reasons:  1/ If you have no privacy about your financial récords, you are vulnerable to criminals.  2/ Criminals can belong to any organization, including the government. And finally 3/ We as citizens have the duty of **not trusting** the government. Period.

I don´t know, the post is about the possibility that a new technology (unknown today) is able to provide an immutable registry without the reward.   It would be too daring to say that no new technology could ever achieve that.
But the final answer to the question is **yes**, because Bitcoin could then be implemented in that immutable registry, or even Bitcoin could upgrade with that new technology.
@_date: 2018-06-15 17:21:59
Indeed, I agree that privacy/anonimity/fungibility is the most important thing that should be improved.  That´s much more important than scalability, in my opinion.    Any improvement can be co-opted by bitcoin, that´s indeed my conclusion in the post linked to this thread.
@_date: 2018-06-15 16:48:51
Bitcoin is more than a technology, it is a concept (essence). If Bitcoin is able to evolve technologically without betraying its essence, the answer to the question is a big **yes**
@_date: 2018-06-15 16:10:55
I totally agree with this: "Bitcoin is just a massive pump that transforms human greed into immutability of the ledger".   And as far as I know is the best way to get immutability.
Nevertheless, I am not at the position to refute that a new technology could achieve the same degree or higher degree of immutability without a reward.
But my conclusion in that post is that even if such a technology is possible, then that would be the perfect place to implement Bitcoin, or even current Bitcoin could upgrade with that technology.   So the answer for me is a big **yes**.

Fiat currency is always an obligation from commercial or central banks.   There is no doubt about it because their issuers must obligue themselves to accept it to cancel debts, otherwise fiat currency would be worthless.
To avoid terminology missunderstandings I referred very specifically to the type of money that is not anyone else´s liability.  I stated it twice to make sure I was clear enough.

So the benefit is doing exactly the same things without the federation, or being able to do more things and also without the federation?  
I understand that federation has the downside that it needs trust, so how is this improved with typhon?

My point is not that the Bitcoin bubble will not burst.  All bubbles eventually burst.  My point is that bubbles are an indicator that the inflated asset might be very relevant / useful.

No.  The bottle of coke is a present good that has value because of its utility.   The paper is a debt, and its value depends on the creditworthiness of the issuer and on the utility of the bottle of coke. 
Intrinsic value and labour theory of value (Marx) were debunked 150 years ago.

That is a natural science approach to economics in the sense that "if I can not eat it, wear it or touch it, it is not real".  For that kind of needs we already have physics and biology.  
Economics scope is far much wider. There is not such a thing as real enjoyment versus artificial or intermediate enjoyment.   The need for communication (fulfilled by language), the need for exchange (fulfilled by money), the need for predicting others behaviour (fulfilled by moral / law) are much more important human needs than physiological needs, and all those needs and their respective solutions are very real no matter if they fully reside on the realm of the abstract.

Bitcoin market cap is directly proportional to its demand.  If Bitcoin is demanded by millions of users as MoE I don’t think it will be useful at $2.  You might not need speculators, but markets do defenetively  need Speculators trying to discover and anticipate current and future supply and  demand. 
Indeed, price bubbles are an indicator that there are too few speculators, specially shorting Bitcoin.

people using tulip bubble to bash Bitcoin is not because they are worried that bitcoin price might hurt bitcoin usefulness.  People using tulip bubble against bitcoin are trying to ridiculize Bitcoin, implying that is just a temporary mania and Bitcoin will be forgotten sooner or later.

Did you even read the article? No economic good has intrinsic value.  Value is an idea.  Ideas are within human mind not within things. 
Bitcoin has intrinsic properties, like gold, and those intrinsic properties are subjectively assessed by humans.

The definition of currency is general medium of exchange.  So if people use it widely enough, it is currency.   It can be wheat, salt, rice, silver, cigarrettes, gold or Bitcoin.   If people decide to use a good as currency or not, that´s something beyond the intentions of its producer, creator or issuer.   Of course it is also beyond my opinion or yours regarding the definition of currency.

I don´t think that most potential buyers/sellers of Bitcoin care much about an academic paper from the research department of the Federal Reserve of Saint Louis.
The interesting thing is how this paper depics the reach of the final stage of grief about Bitcoin within the Academia.

That´s true for Bitcoin blockchain as a whole (code, consensus algorithm, blockchain...), the bitcoin token is a specific part of the protocol (UTXO units), not the protocol itself.
@_date: 2018-04-24 10:17:02


That´s true for the Bitcoin blockchain, but Bitcoin the unit (the UTXO units, if you want) is currency if the market (the users) decide to use it as medium of exchange, whether we like it or not.
