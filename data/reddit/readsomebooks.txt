If you can't tell this site is a scam you are naive. They specialize in long term bets so they can take your money while you are waiting for the results 2 years later. 
I guarantee they are taking money from the bank and day trading with it. If they lose money, no big deal its not theirs.

This is a scam. The owner is actually bitmedia and he is trying very hard to hide the fact. 
It is a known scammer from Australia. 
DO NOT TRUST THIS EXCHANGE!

You are literally describing a pyramid scheme.

It doesn't matter if that is what they believe, there is no police or government protecting bitcoin. Therefore it is completely unregulated. You are stupid to participate.

You probably are in on the scam.

Why wait to earn it when you can just claim it so much that people will inevitably believe it.

You are a moron. These are not comparable. Instead of giving money to a third party for stealing the music why not stop dicking around with bitcoins, learn to pirate and give the money to the artist. Who actually created the work.

Hey there scammer.

Not quite, actually a pyramid scheme is what is being described here.

I don't imagine they care if you can verify them. They rather you be skeptical then lose your money I imagine.

Says the PR guy for the company. Nice scam, scammer.

See the problem with this is then you either have a cabal of established vendors and people have to be scammed to verify a new vendor. This is why the free market is stupid and we started regulating things. 
Its better to just check if meat is bad instead of waiting for people to die then decide its not good to buy meat from that company. The free market is simply too short sighted, you have to provide a long term vision for it to work.

You realize that monopoly doesn't mean exactly 100% of the market? Probably not.
