Actual title: Starbucks will keep accepting US dollars by letting Bakkt platform convert bitcoin into fiat. VERY BIG DIFFERENCE. Starbucks wont accept bitcoin, Bakkt accepts the bitcoin. This is arguably not the direction that is intended for bitcoin.   
@_date: 2019-03-06 09:51:58
Bitcoin is meant to be decentralized. Bakkt is a third party which makes bitcoin pointless. The day you can walk up to Starbucks and give them bitcoin for a coffee is the day to celebrate. Giving Bakkt bitcoin who gives Starbucks fiat isn’t as good as it sounds.

$26.5 AUD worth of Bitcoin, which was 0.003567 Bitcoin with a fee of 0.000167. It was a BTC transaction. I use Edge for iphone, I think I saw the store open Blockpower or something? Not to sure. No waiting, the instantly got a notification that I sent the BTC so I walked off, but the paymet was pending for an hour.
@_date: 2019-04-20 07:41:14
Oh cool, I might have a look into this, thanks.
@_date: 2019-04-02 19:51:46
Nah gee, I rode the wave through 2017-2018. It’s just exciting to see it starting to happen again!

A 3k deli sandwich, better have been a damn good sandwich! Haha
@_date: 2019-04-20 07:35:19
Yes exactly! Your last two points hit home. Can’t wait to see where Bitcoin (and other cryptos) take us!
@_date: 2019-04-20 02:48:38
Yes completely agree. Best part about it is that it’s still in it’s early stages, it’s got so much more to come!
@_date: 2019-04-20 22:10:04
I don’t think it is. I found it through word of mouth.
@_date: 2019-04-02 05:34:17
Yep, It was fun while it lasted though haha. 
@_date: 2019-04-20 08:53:55
I commented it somewhere.
@_date: 2019-04-20 07:33:31
What’s coinjar swipe?
@_date: 2019-04-20 07:27:30
Haha, I’m fairly confident that this meal will be worth 100 bucks in a couple of months but you just gotta use it to really get the feels haha.
@_date: 2019-04-20 23:03:52
Nope. I technically didn’t convert it to fiat so I don’t have to pay CGT.
@_date: 2019-04-20 07:30:33
Haha nice one
@_date: 2019-04-20 10:15:15
Why so hostile?
@_date: 2019-04-20 03:26:50
Poached eggs, tomato’s, sour bough bread, mushrooms, bacon and spinach with a caramel milkshake! You gotta treat yourself sometimes you know haha =)

We’re going in a circle here. 
It’s expected to go up in value because we all think it’s worth something. It has value because of it’s intrinsic value. It’s intrinsic value is it’s applications and use cases. Spending it is one of it’s major use cases. That’s the major difference with gold. This cafe (and many other places around the world) wouldn’t accept 26 bucks of gold, but does accept 26 bucks of BTC, because that’s one of it’s fundamentals, being divisible. What is the point of Bitcoin if you say all we should do is hodl it? It wouldn’t be where it is today if the guy didn’t buy that pizza ect. 
The first part of what you said I can not answer as I do not know the answer to that because I’m not the owner.
@_date: 2019-04-20 02:49:00
Hey that’s cool! Wish I could be paid in BTC haha
@_date: 2019-04-20 07:31:23
$26.50 worth of BTC in AUD. Pretty rough but Melbourne isn’t cheap unfortunately.
@_date: 2019-04-20 10:57:23
Oh no of course I do 100% agree with you that this isn’t it’s end goal (although the LN seems to say otherwise), but right now, being used, in my opinion, is good for BTC.
@_date: 2019-04-20 05:18:00
Haha exactly right my friend!
@_date: 2019-04-02 05:52:51
Exactly mate! Still in it’s early stages. Going to be exciting where it goes, not just referring to price, but to how it will possibly change the economic system! 
Mate I wish I first heard of bitcoin at $350. 
@_date: 2019-04-20 03:56:02
Don’t judge a book by it’s cover because it was really good! Haha
@_date: 2019-04-20 10:20:37
Yeah haha, absolute classic stichup.
@_date: 2019-04-20 08:56:27
If EVERYONE held, Bitcoin would be worth nothing. Think about it.
@_date: 2019-04-20 07:37:11
Damn, the classic pizza story. But hey, we can’t ALL just hodl, people have to use it otherwise it’s worth nothing ay.
@_date: 2019-04-20 05:16:50
I used Edge on iOS. It’s really good, can hold multiple of the popular cryptos and nice interface! I do recommend.
@_date: 2019-04-20 07:30:00
People like me are the reason it will be worth $10,000 next year. If EVERY SINGLE PERSON was hodling, the price could possibly be A LOT lower. So you should be thanking me mate haha.
@_date: 2019-04-20 10:01:07
Mate, I bought this with my BTC wallet. Not through bitpay. 
Yes trading does determine it’s value short term but it’s long term value, intrinsic value, is based upon it’s use case. One of it’s more valuable use-cases is being able to buy good and services.
Answer me this, would Bitcoin be worth as much as it is if we couldn’t transact with it? Obviously not. So the reason it has (not all but some) of it’s value is because people actually use it,
@_date: 2019-04-20 04:28:41
I’m normally not a big fan of mushrooms and bacon but this was really good! Just expensive but that’s what you get in Melbourne haha.
@_date: 2019-04-02 05:43:58
Haha nice mate, I couldn’t imagine the feels of that haha, be so weird. I suppose the main reason this is exciting is we’re seeing green. Short-mid term confidence that the price will keep going up slowly. Although I’m still really bullish long term regardless. Just riding the short term waves ay. The fundamentals will carry it long term! 
@_date: 2019-04-20 12:16:43
Support yes, create no. There is a difference. No value to support if the value wasn’t created in the first place. Spending Bitcoin created that value and currently continues to create it’s value.
@_date: 2019-04-20 07:26:24
I don’t know the exact technicals behind how it works but I scan their QR code and when I swipe send, they instantly receive a notification that I have sent the correct amount. The actual Bitcoin is pending the confirmations but they know the Bitcoin is in the pool so I can walk off fine.
@_date: 2019-04-20 02:41:45
Eggs, bacon, toast, mushrooms, tomato and spinach! With a milkshake to top it off haha.
@_date: 2019-04-20 01:29:22
Location: Melbourne, Australia in Fitzroy. Cafe is called ‘Breakfast at Timothy’s.’ Not very many places in Melbourne accept Bitcoin for food so if you’re looking for a place, I do recommend! It was also very tasty!
@_date: 2019-04-20 12:07:00
I knowwww I messed up bad.
@_date: 2019-04-20 11:08:52
HAHA damn, worth it at the time of course though ��
@_date: 2019-04-20 12:15:25
Okay so general question then. What is the point of LN then? Why implement it if Bitcoin is to be only a store of value. 
But we have the luxury to do that with Bitcoin because it’s divisible, unlike gold. Gold is what currency was backed by. Gold is the reason currency used to have value (when the USD was backed 1:1 with gold) You were basically spending gold when you spent currency. So yes, you will pay for your ice cream with gold, digital gold, CURRENTLY. Maybe not 10 years down the track, but right now yes.
@_date: 2019-04-20 03:07:36
Edge Wallet. Easily send/receive Bitcoin and LOTS of other cryptos. I do recommend.
@_date: 2019-04-21 22:45:43
Coinmap is pretty bad though. I investigated like 10 other places that were on coinmap and all of the places had stopped accepting Bitcoin like 3 years ago.
@_date: 2019-05-19 00:08:28
Can’t a mod just delete this post and posts like this for just being straight up miss-leading and click bait.
@_date: 2019-05-29 11:34:27
How do they mislead about fees? From my understanding, BCH fees are super low and BTC fees are getting up to $3, higher.
@_date: 2019-05-12 00:22:24
Don’t worry, I understood your comment for how it was meant to be understood haha.
@_date: 2019-05-29 09:23:34
What is the main reason for hating BCH so much? Sorry I’m sort of new to crypto and still don’t understand the in-fighting between BTC and BCH. For closure, I own only BTC, no BCH.
@_date: 2019-05-20 21:59:08
The video doesn’t play for me, is it because I’m outside the US? Just black screen for 3 seceonds and that’s it. Any ideas?
@_date: 2019-05-19 09:47:19
Where can we watch this if we outside the US? Will it be put up for free on their website or something after its aired? Please and thanks.
@_date: 2019-05-29 11:38:58
This is what I don’t understand. BCH supports make it seem like having bigger block sizes are the way to go without a doubt, but surely there have to be a down side to having bigger blocks. What are these downsides. And inturn, what are the pros for keeping a smaller block size?
@_date: 2019-05-11 07:43:58
Genuinely laughed, I love posts like this.
@_date: 2019-05-29 11:36:41
This is what I never understood. Does Roger Von whatever his name is, own BCH in a way, him and his team. Like can I go and contribute a proposal like I can with BTC?
@_date: 2019-05-21 23:07:47
Yesss it worked, thank you very much!
