For sidechain solutions you need malleability fix. There are plenty of other fixes than segwit. For example FlexTrans with is currently being worked on, on Bitcoin Cash. In the end bch will have everything btc has + low fees and many more.

FlexTrans doesn't hurt Bitcoins security incentives as Segwit does.

You better educate yourself before accusing me that I don't what I talk about.
@_date: 2018-01-08 11:06:35
Not true. For off-chain sclaing solutions you need malleability fix. There are a lot of other ways to fix this. For example Flextrans.

I follow no one but the coin which in my opinion is the best option to combat the current financial system.
I definitely wouldn't follow a coin which proponents use censorship to turn a minority position into a majority.

Because deep in them btc core bagholders know that this coin cannot scale and that they're left with a Store of Value coin with no intrinsic value...

its a bit complicated and differs from country to country I guess
Here in Germany: "bills in euro are the only unlimited legal tender" and "payment in legal tender fullfills all legal obligations owing from liabilities"
It means not exactly that you are forced to accept it, but if someone pays you in euro you cannot sue him to do otherwise which in the end is you are forced to accept.

lol bch is by many metrics the most decentralized coin in existence.
There is no reference implementation like core.
For example nodes: 
Also mining pools are more decentral than btc.

In the whole chart above there is no 100k fluctuation other than the actual so where do you see refularly?
@_date: 2019-03-01 16:49:07
sounds exactly like the core argument for keeping blocks small...
@_date: 2019-03-20 12:33:07
intrinsic value of fiat is the function as a medium of exchange as the state forces businesses to accept it
@_date: 2019-03-01 17:03:47
Not hard to calculate. Right now blocks are full 90% and bitcoin handles 370k transactions a day.
So (370k/3600*24)/0,9=3,9tx/s at current level of segwit adoption and batching. Even at full segwit adoption more than 5tx/s are unrealistic.
Meanwhile bch can handle at least 25tx/s and more to come with Schnorr benig implemented this May.

Quite funny that with 41 million you can erase 1.5 billion market cap.
@_date: 2019-02-28 13:34:47
Or just use Bitcoin like it used to be for years aka Bitcoin Cash. Subcent Fees and Onchain Scaling right now compared to LN "might work in 2 years"...

1. Tweet was not by Roger Ver
2. Whats wrong about it? When fees become 20 $ again, soon to see when blocks are full again, it naturally drives demand down. People who want to invest low amounts get driven out of the market.

Last time fees skyrocketed BTC saw the biggest drop in btc transactions ever witnessed. Even today we did not fully recover from this drop.

"spv wallets are not trustless."
There has not been a single case where spv wallet users lost money despite huge amount of btc send around by spv wallets. Sounds quite trustworthy, doesn't it?
"I have a non-custodial mobile lightning wallet for small transactions (eclair) and it just works."
The problem is what is when your phone is off battery, off network, gets lost or destroyed? You cannot receive money and your channel balance is most likely gone as well. With spv you can always receive and get your btc back all you need is to know you seed phrase.
"and those fee levels were a clear outlier on the tx volume-fee curve."
Still doesn't change the fact that btc was heavily centralized on the rich for a month. And with increasing usage fees like this will return, it already starting to happen atm actually.
"Anyone can run a routing node."
This I would doubt. Tbh i didn't try for myself but I would guess the average Electrum user can't do it.
@_date: 2019-04-19 16:23:53
Can you give me a link to where they have been debunked?
That 50$ fees in Dezember 2017 cut everyone below this limit out of the network causing centralization on the rich is an undeniable fact. That by far the majority of LN users nowadays use custodial wallets is a fact. That to download and setup a spv wallet takes 5 minutes compared to setup an always online LN node is a fact that everyone can check fast for themselves.
@_date: 2019-04-19 17:15:15
running out of arguments?
@_date: 2019-04-19 15:30:57
actually Rizun talks about how LN will cause bank like centralization, how high fees already have caused massive centralization and how spv wallet prove much better user experience in regards to decetralization compared to LN non custodial nodes.
Have you even heard the interview?
@_date: 2019-04-19 16:37:19
afaik people only lost money on electrum by falling for pishing scams. this has nothing to do with spv and can happen with any service in the world.
