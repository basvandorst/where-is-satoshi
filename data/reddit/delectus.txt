I'm fine with it too. Part of the issue is that Coinbase didn't use Apple's system of in-app purchases and allowed the direct purchase of bitcoins from their app, which is against Apple's developer policy. It's getting on my nerves seeing all these "Oh man fuck Apple!" Posts when the apps clearly violate Apple's policy. It's pretty much like saying "Man, let's boycott Apple for not allowing emulators or porn apps!"
(Downvote if you'd like, but this is just my two cents) If you're willing to jump ship over Bitcoins alone, so be it. But in reality the amount of users leaving over this is way too small for Apple to make an exception to their policy. I'm pretty sure the fraction of users saying they switched to Android because of Bitcoins alone is so insignificant that it doesn't even matter. They've gotten your business and they probably will be perfectly fine without it.

Exactly. It appears that Apple is treating this like the purchase of money in games, which I'll say is unfair, but you technically aren't getting goods, be it a physical object or a Steam game, for your payment. You're getting a number with an assumed value. This number is special because it's a magical internet currency, but Apple still sees it as just a number.

Exactly. The actions being taken to show that people dislike Apple for not supporting Bitcoin are pretty absurd. Saying you weren't going to purchase another Apple product is a really roundabout way of getting these issues resolved. They've gotten your money (and most likely a lot of it) and, quite frankly they probably don't even need your business anymore. You aren't hurting anyone but yourselves when you decide that Apple isn't worthy of having your business. If you just decide to go out and get an Android, you're still spending upwards of $100 instead of using the perfectly good iPhone you have in front of you. You've already paid for it, so why not try and change some of the policies Apple has in order to support Bitcoin Wallet apps?

Exactly. Everyone higher up in the thread is railing about how the walled garden technique doesn't work, but in reality it results in a lot less shitty apps. There are some odd exceptions, like this, but a few weird cases doesn't ruin the whole system. If rather wait for an official reason than rail that Apple failed.

You're also getting denied the right to install malware and other malicious programs. I mean really, who does that?!
There are pros and cons to the walled garden design, but generally it's more beneficial than to just say "Fuck it, make whatever you want."

Exactly. I subscribed to this to learn more about Bitcoin, and it's turned out to be "Guys, Apple actually enforced it's ToS on an app, let's bash that whenever we can." It's pretty disgraceful.

Technically shitty app probably wasn't the ideal terminology. Google Play Store (as far as I am aware) doesn't prescreen their apps, so the chances of getting a bugged or malicious app is a lot higher than on the Apple's App Store. But there are shitty apps on both stores (fake screenshots, lies about features, etc.)

Also, to my understanding, the NSA needs to intercept the devices to implant spyware.
