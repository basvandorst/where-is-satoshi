No problem. Do you have any questions about buying Bitcoin or just BTC in general I can help you with?

My only comment on a Moolah/CoinPal relationship is that they both appear to have been unfortunate enough to come under your management. To clarify, I was not commissioned by Moolah. Since you have the time to respond to my comment, please use all time to respond to the Syscoin devs from whom you have stolen hundreds of thousands of dollars.

That's the IP that relayed the transaction, so it is "linked" to the sending address. We're looking for the IP of the wallet that you are trying to get into, so we would use an outgoing transaction from the 16CWaX wallet and try to get an IP out of that. The multiple outgoing transactions all have different IPs from all over the world, so the sender is likely obfuscating the address. There's nothing else I can do to narrow down that address. Bitcoin is purposely pseudonymous.

Yes, I linked the download page for it on the AppStore above.

I know the prices are denominated in pounds, but you'll be paying in BTC. Where do you see the restriction?

[ANX]( offers a really fast way for you to get BTC, and their fees are as low as 0.3%. Let me know if you have any questions about ANX. 
@_date: 2014-11-21 18:26:44
Please explain. 
@_date: 2014-11-30 12:17:59
Try [ANX Vault]( if you're interested in trading.

The reason for the Justcoin hold was an exploitation of a well-documented (edit: by the XRP devs) issue with both the Stellar and Justcoin networks. To their credit, Justcoin decided to place a hold on a small fraction of balances instead of going fractional reserve, which just digs the hole deeper. 
For more information on the bug go [here]( or to create an ANX account go [here](
@_date: 2014-12-09 02:54:07
If you still need to trade BTC/USD on a regular basis, I would recommend [ANX]( Fees are as low as 0.3% and once you get verified, you're done in that respect.
@_date: 2014-11-18 13:37:41
Circle charges no fees, but the credit card and occasionally bank companies do, meaning that it makes more sense to use another exchange. For even lower selling fees (0.3%) you can try [ANX]( which is really easy to use compared to a lot of other exchanges in my opinion. 
@_date: 2014-12-10 03:21:59
PayPal is generally not an option due to charge backs, and places that do offer PayPal for BTC charge very high fees. If you're open to using your bank account I would suggest [ANX]( as fees are much lower, plus they have great support. 
@_date: 2014-12-30 14:41:18
The inevitable collapse of PayCoin will not result in cryptocurrencies being viewed positively by the public.

Coinbase doesn't allow you to buy directly with a credit card...only a bank account. 
@_date: 2014-12-15 03:32:33
No problem and thanks for the tip! Do you have any other questions about using ANX?
@_date: 2014-11-29 15:50:07
They're very, very careful with fraud and Coinbase will often cancel purchases they believe to be possible fraud. Try to put it into manual review. 
If you're insterested in buying BTC otherwise, I would recommend [ANX]( for their great support and low fees
@_date: 2014-12-28 16:17:55
[ANX]( is a great service that allows you to trade Bitcoin with fees as low as 0.3%, plus they offer a debit card that lets you spend your BTC almost anywhere. Let me know if you have any questions about ANX.

@_date: 2014-12-09 02:56:16
There's really no option available for that yet, but if you're open to using your bank account, I would recommend [ANX]( for buying BTC at low prices. They take security very seriously, and you can learn more about that [here](
Let me know if you have any questions about them.

Mining, unfortunately, is no longer profitable for the vast majority of miners. Cloud mining is a risky investment. If you want BTC, buying is the best way to get it, and for that I'd suggest you use [ANX]( They have fees as low as 0.3% and offer a debit card that you can load with your BTC. Do you have a wallet yet or any other questions about Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-12-12 03:52:47

Once you get verified with [ANX]( you can easily buy thousands worth of BTC from them. 
@_date: 2014-11-20 22:32:04
I use Trezor. Expensive but much less expensive than losing my Bitcoin. Stop using blockchain.info though. I cannot stress that enough.
I got into Bitcoin after reading an article about it several years ago. 
Circle is okay but personally I would recommemd [ANX](
@_date: 2014-12-29 21:26:05
Anywhere debit cards are accepted, and for places that don't, you can withdraw your balance at any ATM.

It's definitely unethical. A comparison would be someone who kept their wallet in a back pocket and you taking it because they didn't properly protect it AND taking all the cash out.

@_date: 2014-11-19 03:11:29
You may have to delete CoinPocket first if you plan on using Breadwallet. If you're into trading bitcoin though, I would recommend the ANX Vault app, available at the bottom of the page [here]( It's a really versatile app and a feature that I really love lets me set BTC addresses for my contacts so if I want to pay a friend I don't have to enter an address.
@_date: 2014-12-30 00:32:56
I believe BTC sales are available for online merchants but BTC is not yet supported for Square brick and mortar merchants.

There's a simple way to do this using [ANX]( Deposit USD to ANX and buy BTC with it, and then sell that BTC for EUR and withdraw. With fees as low as 0.3%, you'll save a lot of money. 
@_date: 2014-11-30 12:14:26
Exchanges have to comply with KYC and AML laws and your information is always kept safe.

@_date: 2014-12-02 21:16:43
Depending on your country and what withdrawal method you choose, [ANX]( should let you withdraw your fiat and crypto balances very quickly. 
@_date: 2014-11-25 13:30:11
If he has access to any kind of bank account he could easily use a bitcoin exchange like [ANX]( which has really low fees.

@_date: 2014-12-10 23:55:50
If you don't want to use BitPay you'll have to use an exchange for converting your BTC into USD, and I'd recommend that you consider [ANX]( Once you get verified with them you can trade with fees as low as 0.3%.

Mining is profitable in rare cases, but for the home miner the electricity costs are generally higher than the rewards. There are massive warehouses that runs hundreds of bitcoins worth of mining equipment. When Bitcoin was only worth a fraction of a cent, people were able to mine profitably using a CPU. But as BTC has a ten minute block time, the difficulty of finding a block has increased as mining hardware has progressed from CPUs to GPUs to FFPGAs to ASICs. Bitcoin trading can be profitable.

At this point, buying makes much more sense than trading. [ANX]( is a great way to invest in Bitcoin, as their fees are as low as 0.3%, plus all customer funds are held in cold storage, meaning that it would be very difficult for your coins to be stolen. Let me know if you have any questions about getting started with them. 
@_date: 2014-11-24 03:40:33
I don't know what coin you are looking to trade but [ANX]( has just added two coins. In terms of feedback on the two exchanges listed above, I've used EmpoEx.

@_date: 2014-08-04 16:41:54

[ANX Vault]( is a great wallet for new users. All your Bitcoin is held in cold storage, meaning that it would be extremely difficult to steal. Your account is held in the cloud, meaning that device failure is a non-issue. 
@_date: 2014-11-25 22:57:08
Let me know if you have any other questions about Bitcoin! I'd be glad to help.
@_date: 2014-12-13 19:30:00
You have to find a balance between ease of use and security. I'd recommend you keep some of your BTC in a hot wallet, like [ANX Vault for Android]( which allows you to both buy and sell as well as pay for goods or services from your phone, and keep the rest in cold storage, which is much more secure but harder to access. 
@_date: 2014-12-30 00:29:10

This is unacceptable and extremely unprofessional.
I used to use [Cryptsy]( for altcoin trading but I stopped using it after they refused to take responsibility for another error a few months back. Now I would recommend [ANX]( It offers BTC, LTC, and DOGE trading, but now that they have acquired Justcoin you can trade XRP and STR.
@_date: 2014-12-04 21:27:49
The fastest way to do that is to use the same exchange for USD-&gt;BTC and BTC-&gt;AUD. [ANX]( is a good exchange for this, and as they comply with all KYC and AML regulations, it will be legitimate as well. Localbitcoins fees are much higher as in person sellers usually charge a premium. 
@_date: 2014-12-30 15:31:57
That's a very laissez-faire approach. GAW is preying on the young and elderly with promises of absurdly high returns. People could lose their life savings. It doesn't directly affect us but some might feel that they have a moral responsibility to inform others about this scam.

@_date: 2014-11-19 03:21:09
Could you link to the transaction on blockchain.info? 
@_date: 2014-12-26 21:18:47
[ANX]( is an exchange that lets you place buy and sell orders in real time, just like a stock exchange. No wait once you place the order, and you can use a local bank transfer or a bank wire. This protects you from the LocalBitcoins markups

Also worth noting is the overlapping circles in both my logo and Moolah's

Try [ANX]( Right now you're not able to use your credit or debit card but the fees are as low as 0.3%. 
@_date: 2014-12-24 04:08:03
[ANX]( is a reputable exchange that complies with all local laws. Once you get verified, you can buy as much BTC as you wish.
@_date: 2014-12-30 14:10:36
Paycoin is a cryptocurrency released by GAW. It is extremely clumsy and it is essentially a fork of Peercoin with Darkcoin nodes built in. The majority of the changes on GitHub are meaningless and GAW has promised that the coin will be worth $20. They are also charging users to stake the coin. 
@_date: 2014-11-26 14:34:39

I may not be able to answer all your questions fully so if you need further clarification please contact support You can fund your account with GBP via ZipZap, wire transfer, or a Hong Kong local bank transfer. Asia NeXgen (ANX) was established in 2013 and while registered in Hong Kong, it is fully compliant with local KYC and AML laws.

There really isn't any service that allows for BTC/PayPal transactions because one currency is easily reversible and the other is not. You'll have to use an exchange/bank account to sell your BTC, and for that I'd recommend you use [ANX]( Their exchange volume will allow you to sell your coins and withdraw to an account very quickly, possibly on the same day. You can sell your BTC for any of 10 national currencies with them with fees as low as 0.3%
Let me know if you have any questions about selling BTC.

@_date: 2014-11-21 19:01:06
That's what I meant. I apologize for not clarifying. I have no idea why the developers thought it would be in there best interest not to inform any gateway or exchange of the flaw, though.

@_date: 2014-12-03 18:41:57
At this point it's not really profitable to mine, especially since you are using a GPU and not an ASIC. If you're interesting in earning BTC visit or if you want to buy BTC I recommend [ANX]( for its low fees and focus on security.

It will not. Just make sure you download the wallet from the official website at 
Let me know if you have any questions about actually getting Bitcoin.

Not a problem. Let me know if you have any questions about ANX or exchanging GBP in general

No service at this time accepts Canadian credit cards in exchange for Bitcoin, but if you are open to using your bank account, [ANX]( is a great way to buy BTC with CAD with fees as low as 0.3%. Please let me know if you have any questions about using ANX to buy BTC. 
@_date: 2014-11-19 03:23:57
What I would do is use the ANX Vault app on the bottom of the page [here]( which allows me to set BTC addresses for contacts so I don't have to mess with QR codes.

Holy shit. They hired me to design an alternate logo and never paid me. Let me see if I can find the design. Never would have guessed that "Alex" and the "Ryan" who scammed me on the design were one person. 
Edit: Found it quickly.

The wallet service is very insecure compared to other wallets, and it's also vulnerable to MITM attacks making it a bad choice for storing funds.

[ANX]( is a great way for you to get started with Bitcoin. Once you get verified as per local legislation, you can trade Bitcoin and altcoins like Litecoin or Dogecoin with fees as low as 0.3%. If you let me know what country you are in I can better explain how a bank transfer would work. Also, let me know if you have any questions about ANX.

For even quicker integration, download the [ANX Vault app]( and use [ANX]( to buy BTC.
@_date: 2014-12-30 15:58:25
Absolutely. But people will associate cryptocurrencies with scams even more so when GAW collapses. 
@_date: 2014-11-21 13:59:03
ANX takes security very seriously.
[ANX Security](

There may be Anonymous hackers on the ground but I assure you the majority of those wearing Guy Fawkes masks were not members of Anonymous.

[ANX]( is the sixth largest BTC exchange in the world, so the rate will be very close to the bitcoinaverage or Coindesk price. Three cards are offered, and you can learn more about them [here]( but there are no fees for purchases and ATM fees are $3 for a withdrawal, much lower than my old debit card. There are no monthly fees, and purchase fees for the Premium card are waived as part of the [Load for Free program](

It's located in Hong Kong and uses a bank there, but they comply with all local regulations based on your jurisdiction.

Mining cryptocurrencies, as a general rule, is not particularly profitable, depending on what you are mining with. Your best bet is buying. [ANXPRO]( supports buying and selling Bitcoin with ten national currencies as well as trading altcoins with fees as low as 0.3%. Please let me know if you have any questions about them. 
@_date: 2014-12-01 22:48:14
At this point it is no longer profitable for you, as an individual, to mine. 
The best ways to obtain Bitcoin are to either earn it, by selling products or services, or to buy it. 
I recommend you visit if you're interested in working for BTC, or if you're interested in buying, go [here]( for a secure and affordable fiat/Bitcoin exchange. 
Then you'll have to store your BTC. DO NOT use the blockchain.info wallet and if you make the decision to keep your coins in a hot wallet (meaning they can be spent more easily), make sure you use two factor authentication for your accounts. 
Or you can use cold storage, there's an excellent tutorial [here]( 
Let me know if you have any specific questions about getting started with Bitcoin.

[ANX]( is a great exchange for buying BTC with fees as low as 0.3%. In terms of safety and security, 100% of ANX customer funds are held in cold storage, so if you have 2FA enabled, it would be very difficult to steal your coins. ANX is based in Hong Kong but complies with all local regulations. You can read more about security [here]( and please let me know if you have any questions about buying BTC.

Account security.

Maybe a multisig scavenger hunt where they have to work together to get the private key?
@_date: 2014-11-24 02:31:17
That's unfortunate. There have been a lot of people having issues making instant purchases through them, myself included. [ANX]( works a little differently for buying bitcoin, but the fees are lower and it's easy to use.
@_date: 2014-08-04 16:40:47
How constructive.
@_date: 2014-11-27 02:41:13
I've also had a bad experience with their support, who always appear to be unprofessional. 
Now I would recommend [ANX]( lower fees and much better support.
@_date: 2014-12-31 21:52:17
[ANX Vault]( is a great wallet for new users. 
@_date: 2014-11-22 13:40:53
They support more currencies than any other exchange.
@_date: 2014-12-17 02:33:21
[ANX]( allows you to exchange AUD for BTC with much lower fees, as low as 0.3%
@_date: 2014-11-19 23:27:47
I like using [ANX](  Fees are really low and it's easy to set up.
@_date: 2014-11-19 16:19:05
I know of a few other people having similar issues with OKCoin verification. In my opinion verification on [ANX]( is a lot easier to complete and it's totally secure plus their fees are lower.  
@_date: 2014-12-10 03:19:48
Once you get verified with [ANX]( you can sell your BTC for fiat with fees as low as 0.3% and withdraw to your bank account very quickly.
