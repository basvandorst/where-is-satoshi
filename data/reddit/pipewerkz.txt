Chase purchase has always been a credit card, which gets paid off every month. I've done deposits with Capital One bank account and haven't got denied, was a few weeks ago though.

Why do people start videos with music like that? Drives me nuts. I would give my bitcoin away if I never again had to hear a techno beat drop at the start youtube video.

Gold was heavy and hard to steal which is why they decided thousands of years ago to use it as currency? Complete and utter bullshit. Please read Murray Rothbard's "What Has Government Done to Our Money?"

I think that's why he said thoughts and prayers. Its pretty neutral if you don't know the person you are giving those wishes to.
I will grant you that the chicken example is a good point, but I didn't say I have respect for it one way or the other. 
I certainly have more respect for a person who cares to give thoughts and prayers over someone who will chastise that same person, instead of just keeping their mouth shut.

I signed up on this site and have only used the free version. It lets you import trades from lots of the big exchanges. 
Worth looking at. The free account has tons of info, the pro account gives you API tracking and tax reporting (including capital gains report).
I have a 10% link since I am signed up if you decide you want to go pro, send me a PM. I am in no way affiliated with this site, only used it.

Yeah, but ending up with a pocket full of coins sucks. I've visited Canada several times and just recently Australia. If you are out shopping or getting some drinks/food at different spots using cash, it gets rather annoying.

Create a folder in your bookmarks named "Exchanges" and bookmark the exchanges you use, access the sites from there. Don't type them into google and click. My mom and dad do shit like that.

What? Funny this is your first point of contention.


Wrong - Constitution does not give the federal government control over education. Politically he believes that education should go back to the states, not abolishing public education. Getting rid of the Department of Education does not mean abolish public schools. Personally, he believes education should be provided in the market.


Point? People should make their intentions known so that they can rise and fall in the market, not having people inadvertently support racist organizations.


Who cares? If you've ever read or listened to anything by Ron Paul, this wouldn't be a point of contention for you.


"destroy" - again, no authorization in the Constitution for the Federal Government to be involved. State function. 


Not true. You are talking about a personal belief rather than a political belief. 


Money is in politics because they have something to sell that is way more powerful than money - Power. He has done nothing but fight for the removal of concentrated power in the federal government.


That is done every time they more money is printed - do you think the US plans to pay back that debt, and how?

I didn't mean to slam your video, not my intention, sorry for that. I personally just have a hard time continuing to watch it when I hear that. It is just a personal opinion.

No one knows what is going to happen on Sunday. Look, if you put a bunch of money in at 15-16k, it probably wasn't your best decision in the short term, but you will might be good on the longer term. Are you a new trader? The worst thing you can do is buy at a high price, get pissed and sell when it goes down. If you think its going up eventually, hold it and weather the storm. Buy some more if the price dips, don't ever chase highs.

He clearly comes from a libertarian philosophy. Libertarianism is based on the non-aggression principle, everything stems from you owning yourself, your actions (good and bad) and the fruits of your labor. Talking about any state run "institutions" or saying that "we can do X" is out of the realm of libertarianism and into the realm of politics and the Libertarian party.

Price dropping to or a bit below previous strong resistance, 25-30% maybe. No one knows what is going to happen. Pull up some charts on tradingview, open an interactive chart. Be sure to change the time frames for multiple views (5mins, 30mins, hourly, daily.)
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:10:35
Most exchanges make you do that if you want to deposit and withdraw fiat. Most likely US law/patriot act stuff.

Been into crypto coming up to almost 2 years now. Have never once visited this sub-reddit until a couple weeks ago. I honestly can't believe some of the stuff I see. Just speaking from an outside view.

"Bitcoins use &gt; golds use" - maybe for payments and that is about it. Gold could easily be held and spent as cash with services like Gold Money. You can have a card that converts to whatever currency you are using and removes that gold holding from your account. Not to mention the industrial use of both both gold/silver. A bit confident for someone who has owned Bitcoin for a few weeks. Diversify. Your. Portfolio. Knock off this "people are investing to use as a stock" What?!?

Because weak hands (people that get in only to make money) sell to strong hands (people that believe in the fundamentals of what they are investing in or long because they think it will go higher, so they buy at lower prices) - Markets move on technicals and fundamentals.

Brings me back to 5/2011, when silver was coming off its near $50 dollar high, BTFD!! --&gt; Down +50% over 5 years.
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:01:03
Because this sub-reddit has irrational post after irrational post about how everyone should keep buying into the highs because it is going up higher no matter what. If you believe that, keep buying and stop worrying. If you realize that a 45% gain in a week, 120% in a month is not sustainable and you bought at a much lower price, you'd be crazy not to take some profit. People think it is going to crash on Sunday because the futures market is opening on wall street. No one knows what is going to happen, lots of people are worried because they jumped in at 15k on lots of hype and don't want it to drop. The people that have had bitcoin for many years really don't care if it goes down because they will probably buy more. I promise you some of them have taken some profits, regardless of the HODL bullshit.
