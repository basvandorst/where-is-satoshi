Have they said what they plan to do? Refund the customers they stole from or just carry on living the life of Riley with stolen money?

Say what you like about Google but they sell some great tin foil hats in Google Shopping. I can recommend them for someone like yourself.

Must have changed. Wont let me withdraw anything.

How do you mean? Sorry, I'm a bit of a BTC noob.

Fraud? That's my plan. I'll print my name in the same font that T-Mobile uses on the back of my bill (so the paper and print texture looks the same) then Photoshop it over the name that is normally there. Would fool anyone (hopefully.)

Cheers for the incredibly useful tip. Are you always so incredibly helpful?

Oxford and urban are not words that go together. Have you ever been to Oxford?

I'm considering the fraud route too. I don't want to but I may have to.

This is what I'm trying now. Hoping it will work...

I mean normal for Bitcoin. I mean, does this sort of thing happen regularly to the value of BTC? In perticular, in relation to the value of GBP, USD and other major currencies.

Unfortunately not. I could try and get the name on the bill changed though.

Heh! Don't worry! I wouldn't touch Mt.Gox again with a barge pole. However, they still have about £300 of my money (money I need to buy a PS4) so I need to get that out.
@_date: 2013-11-16 00:22:59
Nope, unfortunately, that doesn't seem to be the situation. It's just Mt.Gox dicking me around as far as I'm concerned.

Are there any sites where one can buy Steam wallet credit for BTC? Might act as a worthy alternative until Valve officially integrates it.

When are you chaps going to start working with UK retailers?
@_date: 2013-11-15 23:56:22
Nope. It's trapped there.
@_date: 2013-11-16 00:15:13
I could use a bill... If I had any. That's the problem with being a minor.
