Sure, but if you like autorotation and you only want to quickly look at one thing, is it really worth going into the settings, turning it off, rotating your phone, then going back into your settings and turning it back on? I think you're just trying to be a smart ass.

Are you using google ultron or chrome?

LPT: If you hold down somewhere on your screen while you rotate your phone, the orientation wont change.

Yeah what if we just buy things with bitcoin? Do we have to pay any extra tax besides sales tax if there is any?

Bitcoin newb here. Recently dipped my feet and now I'm ready to dive in. Just waiting for the right time to do so and started think creatively... with a net neutrality ruling near, would a shitty ruling that severely hurt net neutrality cause a dip in bitcoin, creating the perfect time for me to buy in big?

Always the big guys fucking over the little guys. Yay capitalism.
