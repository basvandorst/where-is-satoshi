Somebody had to, or else it wouldn't be at 19.5k.

Pretty sure there's always the exact same amount of buying as selling.

I'm not misunderstanding anything. I just don't know at all and am asking. My knowledge of bitcoin mining is not erroneous, it is non-existant.
@_date: 2014-01-17 00:12:03
Couldn't I run hundreds of thousands of miners simultaneously?
@_date: 2014-01-17 00:19:56
Aaah. That makes sense now.
@_date: 2014-01-17 01:00:53
Yes, but that's kind of beside the point for a hypothetical question. The "computer from the future" point is just to facilitate a question about bitcoin mining. If I had access to time travel, bitcoin would be the last thing on my mind too.

Yes, I know that now. But surprisingly those comments appeared only after I asked the question in the first place.

Technically it was after The Great Depression too.

So that's still 1820% profit.
That's how it works, right?
@_date: 2018-11-21 00:02:22
You still think this?
It's at $4,300 right now and dropping. It's going to have to work hard to see 2300% growth in 40 days.

I would like to use BTC but I can't think of any benefits of using it. Why should I use it?

Median is an average. So is mean and mode.

It's chips with chicken and gravy. Poutine has cheese curds, this doesn't.

Why is it foolish? It's not like it has any bearing on anything.
I promise to buy every one in this thread a Lamborghini if Bitcoin reaches $5,000 next year.
See how easy it is?
