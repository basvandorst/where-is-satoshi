Because I believe that bitcoin is going to hold its value better than any fiat currency. And if I have my money is in the bank it can be confiscated.

What private information? Nobody is asking for private information. Or your private key. Signing a message with both addresses just proves that it is the same person. We don't even need to know who the person is.

I agree with you that we extract value from the last people who get in, the fiat and fiat debt holders. Bitcoin is acting as expanding the monetary base. So there is more money chasing the same goods and services. The absolute amount the last holders of fiat and fiat debt will lose will depend on the preference of bitcoin against fiat, which will show as fiat-bitcoin exchange rate.
But central banks are inflating money anyway. At 5% inflation rate for 60 years, holders of fiat would lose 95% of its purchasing power.
You can take solace that at least with the emergence of bitcoin, this will be the last time that it will happen. In some way the biggest losers are the banks because bitcoin strips their power to print money. Of course they won't lose stocks and commodity futures they hold and get poor. But we took away their power of robbing our savings in money. This tap is closed for them. :D
More about the losers, and here I am less sure, since there is actually 10 times more bonds then fiat. This means that bond holder are the ones losing more. Which I believe are pension funds, insurance companies, banks and some rich individuals. But nobody is stupid, they have a reasonable diversification. So even if their bonds evaporate they still have stock and commodities. Therefore, depending on the quality of their managers, their loss is capped.

from where I see I am 3500% up from where I started. I am from a thirld-world country, I have lived 1000% inflation, and my parents salary going scrap and savings account being confiscated.
If I brake a leg, crash a car or lose a job I can draw money from a buffer I would not even have if it weren't for bitcoin. And if you did not notice I still have my previous savings, all 110% of it (yeah I drew a little back and still made 10% over).
But despite the fun I am having with you I should stop feeding you troll.
@_date: 2015-05-25 22:24:49
Very limited extent you mean. Apart from price every other figure indicates bitcoin is thriving, number of wallets created, transactions, VC investment, merchant acceptance, government not really fighting it, use cases such as remittances in Indonesia and Argentina. What else do you see? 
@_date: 2014-09-18 22:11:38
up 35X from when I converted 10% of my savings to bitcoin. Of course now most of my savings is bitcoin. My savings never went down from 95% of the starting amount. I am currently just enjoying the 35X. It was better before when it was 50X but I am ok with it.
@_date: 2014-09-19 02:54:19
99%! Not even 99% of the people have savings account, how can you say that? Most people don't have savings at all. Not in financial assets.
Even for those who have savings account they haven't seen they savings go up much either.
I don't know where you come from in your comment, but I believe a position in bitcoin is a prudent move.

I thought the same. They could integrate some random number generator based on chaotic analog circuit and mask it with user generated random number to solve this.
@_date: 2016-01-12 12:22:29
This does not answer point. How do you expect to scale bitcoin. Do you think that every transaction should go to the blockchain? LN is the best proposal for scalability I've seen so far. Or do you believe that LN will necessarly lead to super hubs? The good side of LN is that if the hubs start charging too much you can always spin off your own hub.

@_date: 2016-06-01 20:11:05
Look at the audience. This is a talk that needs to work much more with analogies than with technical examples. Besides Andreas is trying to sell the bitcoin vision counter to blockchain walled garden and instead of what is just bitcoin is currently practiced, which he cites ("bitcoin accepted in by thousands of business", "support a 7 billion market cap").

Coins 'hodled' does contribute to the real market cap. They are held by people who believe that it worth more to hold the coins than to trade it for something else. Most of campanies stock are 'hodled' and not actively traded.

Seems like you want a use case that encompass everybody. The thing is that it is not easy to find such case. But there is a variety of different use case. Some times the average joe wants to play poker or smoke weed bitcoin facilitates that. Maybe he is a immigrant that needs to send money back home bitcoin facilitates that. Maybe he lives in a country that government do crazy things with money (such as what just happen in India. Or China, Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, Cyprius. You know if you add up the populations we are talking about half of the world). The thing is that is what money is good for, to be a intermediary of a variety of needs.
If you are asking what is it good for you, maybe there isn't something for you yet. But the world does not stay still.

LN will move a lot of value in one channel, so the setup and settlement cost can be dilluted over many LN transactions, whitch means that the fees for on chain transactions can be much higher than it is today.

When everybody grew up with bitcoin being money, and their father, grand father and greate grand father grew up with bitcoin being money. When they only could know of an age when bitcoin wasn't money is reading history books. When the bitcoin network has being being attacked by people who devoted their lifetime to attacked and still failed. Not even then?

Why should efficiency gains be given to money printers? You should get richer by sitting on your money because sitting you are believing in the money system you are in. Investing is a risky proposition, should be done only if you are up to it.
@_date: 2015-03-09 17:24:58
Every investment has a risk of default. Also also, not every saver is leaving 100% of their BTC under the mattress, some of them invest via lending or other programs. But for now, just by holding your bitcoins your are enabling investments. You are propping up the price of bitcoin, increasing the working capital of all bitcoin holders. The difference is that you are rising everybody's capital, and the person who decides to use their bitcoin holdings to invest are the ones that are risking it. Not like banks or government that risks other peoples money. This way you have the incentives in the right way.
@_date: 2015-02-18 21:49:42
Sure, but it will rise the price o bitcoin against fiat. And the more they buy the more worthless fiat becomes.

Supply of oil is affect its price. The same way the capability of Apple to continue to release awesome products. The underlying base that give value to those assets are no stable.
The supposition is that bitcoin market growth is tied to a growth in trust that should not change much since the underlying technology is not changing much.

One of the reasons people are researching and developing treechains, sidechains is because of that. This creates some kind of decentralized sharding necessary to scale up. Nobody is saying that is a easy problem. But a lot of people believe that it is possible.

First the person is not sitting on his ass. He is working and saving. The rich eventually uses their money. Plus is not only the riches that has saved money. I also save money and I don't want to see the money I worked hard to get being inflated way. Or bailed in by my country or badly invested by my bank. And yes, believing is a valid option. I believe more in the bitcoin community than in banks or the government I am stuck with. I believe the community will be good for my bitcoin when I want to buy stuff, the bitcoin I worked to get. Work which helped to build the economy.
Yeah, you believe in the deflationary spiral. Now tell me why even though in computing prices are always falling the industry is as healthy as ever. And as Bitpay reported, when bitcoin prices go up, sales increases?
Plus you did not address my point of why should money printers get efficiency gain. They are the ones sitting on their ass. I worked for my money, not only for living tomorrow but for when I am old.
Investment won't drop, reckless spending will. The capital holders that are content with 2-3% of deflation are the risk averse and they should have their option. There will be plenty of money that wants a bigger return than that.

I am not arguing golds value as it industrial use. Of course bitcoin is not going to fill gold shoes. But most of gold current price due to its value a money. And it is valued as money because of its vast history. I don't believe bitcoin is replacing gold as a store of value in my lifetime. But if bitcoin is here for some or several generations I can easily see this happening.
