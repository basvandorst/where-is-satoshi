In the current state, that's a ridiculous prediction, literally factors in nothing about the politics within bitcoin but says because of brexit people will use cryptocurrencies...

HODL. All these people here talking about having lost money... you're doing it wrong. You're either in it for the long term or you're looking for get rich quick. If you bought a few weeks back and are already worrying about loses etc then sit back, look at the charts and chill. There is A LOT of internal BTC b/s going on right now, combined with ETF, China and other events creating uncertainty. You have to remember it's only been above $1,200 this month and first month its averaged over $1,000... it's never going to just go up, we're going to the moon but it's a bumpy ride, there's gravity to fight. Stop worrying about the price, you can see from Ethereum today that similar is happening there be it with A LOT more volatility, we're still in the early days, long term goals. Do your research, do not panic and do not play with money you can't afford to lose.

Depends which planet, moon, spacecraft and laws of physics you're referring too - see, I can be technically boring too.

+1 on that situation. I'm a software engineer in London and decided to put my yearly bonus into BTC, bought my first few in late December around 850USD so a little high, got the rest after the recent slide at a better rate so now I can just sit tight, HODL and watch the community and world news with intrigue. For me, bitcoin is my primary investment, I have Ether, Zcash and Monero too but bitcoin is like 75-80% at least. It's either going to pay for a house deposit or set me back 6 months... risk I'm willing to take at this point in my late twenties!

I love how much content and discussion one image has helped contribute to this subreddit.
Live long and HODL.

Conspiracy theory - Maybe he wants the price as low as it can go so he can invest all of the money from this round of miners into Litecoin, then suddenly declare support for Segwit on Litecoin, the price moons, he becomes richer and the entire Litecoin community gives him a huge population boost with live from them also becoming rich... everyone wins?!

If he is doing this, then what's the point because period 7?
