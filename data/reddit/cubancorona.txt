Well, you have a good point.  But I think the gorilla is saying that many people are buying bitcoins to put under their mattresses hoping that their real value will appreciate, rather than to use in commerce.
That, however, will come over time.  It's already happening.

Yes, but few advocate for use of gold *directly* as a currency.  At least by today's standards, precious metals are not sufficiently portable or divisible to provide an efficient *direct* medium of exchange.

It means officially endorsing the idea that we should allow the free market to determine how real value is stored.
Generally speaking, the market should prefer money that is portable, divisible, durable, rare (current problem with $'s), fungible, and unconsumable.  See

I agree with you for the most part.  But I think there is a good argument that bitcoin's effectiveness as a store of value depends at least partially on its acceptance in commerce.  
People say bitcoin is backed by electricity and computing power.  That is true to some extent, but I see bitcoin as being backed first and foremost by the promise of provable rarity, and second, by the goods and services in the bitcoin economy.

There’s a little bit more to this than meets the eye.  
The CFTC operates under a definition of “commodity” that is provided *by statute*.  That statute says that the word “commodity” includes “goods and articles”, *as well as* “services, rights, and interests” that are the subjects of futures contracts.  [7 U.S.C. § 1a(9)]( *and* [CFTC Glossary](
The point is this:  Maybe the CFTC decided that bitcoins are “goods or articles”, or maybe they decided that bitcoins are “services, rights, and interests” for a which a futures market has developed.  I'm not sure if they have said.
Either way, the takeaway likely is quite narrow.

Proof-of-stake as a consensus model: [Proposal: We should vote on the blocksize limit with proof-of-stake voting](
@_date: 2015-09-03 06:28:09
It's a legitimate concern, but I think it would not evoke a plutocracy.
First, it is a vote on a single, particular change to the Bitcoin protocol.
Second, (and this should be analyzed rigorously) incentives seem to be aligned: large stake-holders have an incentive to increase the value and viability of the Bitcoin network.  Perhaps there is a non-zero set of problems where plutocracy achieves an efficient result.
@_date: 2015-03-06 17:50:40

The lines are likely sloped because the X and Y axes do not represent all *possible* bitcoin addresses, but rather all *used* bitcoin addresses.  But, there will be some addresses that have received and never sent.  The result is that there is not a 1:1 geometric correspondence between the two axes, and the lines appear sloped.
TLDR: the lines are geometrically sloped but logically straight.

This, and then old addresses with lost coins (that are thus not updated to the stronger replacement crypto scheme) will be "mined" by searching for the pub/priv keys.  
This could be a mechanism to recover what is likely a substantial portion of currently-mined coins that have been "irretrievably" lost.

Bingo.  As I understand it, though, once an address has been used to *send* coins, the public ECDSA key is known.  If the public ECDSA key for a bitcoin address is known, a weakness in elliptic curve cryptography could compromise the coins owned by that address.
In other words, if you have a bunch of coins, store them in an address from which you have not sent any coins.

That's when bitcoins will become primarily a means of exchange and store of value, rather than an investment vehicle.  That's a good thing.
As for the psychological effect of many dollars purchasing only a small fraction of a bitcoin, we just move the decimal place.  Problem solved.

This is a really great analogy in many respects.  One of the important answers to this question may have to do with legal tender laws (like [31 U.S.C § 5103](  There is, however, support for the idea that legal tender obligations in the U.S. apply only to debts paid to a creditor, not to point-of-sale purchases (see, e.g., [here](
