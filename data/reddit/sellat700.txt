The Dungeons and Dragons Outer Planes books make a lot more sense now I've seen this diagram.

I think it's going all the way to a Brazillion!

Anybody want to buy a Zeptobit?

Remember remember the 18th of November.

I say let them win... if we keep kicking up a fuss they'll just keep on renaming it.

That website doesn't load...  anyway back to the price ticker.

As for buying, unfortunately the best method IMO is buy as much as you can as soon as you can.
If you want a little bit more excitement, I'd put staggered buys in at $20 increments (380, 360, 340 etc.), splitting your money between them.  Then log out of Bitstamp and forget about it.

Have you tried filing a BBB complaint?

Definitely Bitstamp, been using them for 6 months now and never had any problems.  Just send an international payment to their Slovenian bank.
Once you've bought the BTC I'd move it to an address you control (paper wallet, brain wallet, armory client etc.).

100% of BTC in Brain Wallets

6-figure deposit just got credited to my account.  I think we're back in business.

I can see how it could sound like a sarcastic comment, but I filed a BBB complaint and they actually helped me get my order through.  So it was worth a try.

It's not the biggest though.  That honour goes to the Ningi.

This guy sounds like Herschel from the Walking Dead.

I think it's more of a WWWWWWWWWWW curve

But there's more than a 50% chance you'll pay, on average, a higher price for your BTC.
I think it seems counter-intuitive, but with no knowledge of the future and the understanding that Bitcoin's going to appreciate on average a certain percentage per month, the best plan has to be go all-in straight away.

There is no life I know to compare to pure speculation.

Double bag them with ziplock bags too!
