Denominated in US dollars.  Hard currency is not the issue.  The form of currency itself is.  See "petrodollar."

I don't like the idea that it essentially depends on infrastructure and electricity.

What would be the benefit of using bitcoins that way?
@_date: 2015-04-09 12:58:43
Sounds illegal to me.  The USD can not be refused in payment.

You may be right.


And indeed it could be seen as bartering.  The US government doesn't like bartering much, though.  Despite delusions to the contrary, the US government has near-limitless arbitrary power to do whatever it likes and I don't see them tolerating the refusal of US dollars.  They don't even like bitcoins being used in parallel.

Good to know!  I never heard of it before.  I'm a late-adopter of things and I don't look for some shortcut so I doubt I would have used it even if I had heard of it before but it is good to inform others.

So long as the US engages in abjectly unjust foreign policy (on behalf of Israel) I hope the bottom falls out.  If that's what it takes to stop, so be it.  I think it is inevitable.

Yeah, they have rules to make it too burdensome to do or if you do then you can at any time be raided and subject to arbitrary imprisonment and destruction of your livelihood if not life.  IIRC a few years ago there was some ruling about bitcoins being defined as an asset rather than a currency.

All that is denominated in USD - bitcoin is another currency.
