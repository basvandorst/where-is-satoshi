Sure, it isn't terribly scalable, and I sure as hell wouldn't spend half as much time on YouTube as I currently do if I was paying *any* amount per-video, but the system will work itself out.

There are a lot of different people out there. Doesn't really surprise me.

Hopefully [this]( answers your question.
@_date: 2015-12-01 19:00:02
I prefer the following formatting:
    function btceur() { 
        curl -s  | python -c "import json, sys; print json.load(sys.stdin)['bpi']['EUR']['rate']"; 
    }
    function btcusd() { 
        curl -s  | python -c "import json, sys; print json.load(sys.stdin)['bpi']['USD']['rate']"; 
    }
`function btceur() {...}`/`function btcusd() {...}` wrap the lines that follow them into little modules that you can integrate into your own Bash script and use to fetch Bitcoin pricing data.
`curl -s  silently (supressing its general progress reporting, messages, etc.) goes over the network and grabs what is ostensibly current BTC-to-other pricing data from Coindesk (I'm not actually familiar with the site) and feeds it as input to the Python command line tool with ` | python -c`.
Everything that follows (with the exception of the last semicolon `;` on the line, so everything within the double-quotes `"..."`) is a small, inline Python program (the main reason that I prefer my formatting to that above is because it mine makes this much more obvious to me). These programs:
* `"import json, sys; print json.load(sys.stdin)['bpi']['EUR']['rate']"`
* `"import json, sys; print json.load(sys.stdin)['bpi']['USD']['rate']"`
are, obviously, almost identical (and if you ask me, an elegant wrapper script would eliminate one of these functions and make the remaining one parametric). They first import helper libraries (`import json, sys`) that Python can use to fetch, parse, and internally format what curl gives it. `sys.stdin` then references the data that was passed to Python from cURL, `json.load` turns that data into a human-friendly and conveniently-formatted object. The `['bpi']['EUR']['rate']`/`['bpi']['USD']['rate']` statements query this new object for the BTC-to-EUR/BTC-to-USD prices, respectively (it appears that current valid values include `{USD, EUR, GBP}`). Finally, these conversion values are passed to our good friend `print`, who shows those values to you.
Sorry if that long-winded explanation was patronizing or more than anybody here bargained for, but explaining things is kind of fun :)
I apologize if Reddit cuts my formatted line prematurely, I've got plenty of screen real estate here that it really should be taking better advantage of. At any rate, keeping that all on one line (or possibly breaking at the pipe `|`) makes the most sense to me.
**Full script:**
    
    # Usage: program [currency]
    # Default currency.
    currency='USD';
    # Use the currency argument, if available. If it's an invalid value, the program chokes.
    if [ "$ -gt 0 ]; then
        currency=$1;
    # Fetch the data, parse it, and print the requested conversion.
    curl -s  | python -c "import json, sys; print json.load(sys.stdin)['bpi']['$currency']['rate']";

For anybody wondering, `http` versus `https` is the difference here.
@_date: 2015-12-01 19:16:05
Integrate one of these functions into a bash script, make the function parametric and replace the hard-coded currency constant with a reference to that parameter, route a command line argument to this new function, and pass whatever currency constant you'd like retrieved to the script as you run it. Assuming that you pass a valid value, it should work fine and be much more flexible. It appears that at present, valid values are `{USD, EUR, GBP}`.
Alternatively, you could simply print out all of the values to the screen.

If I had to take a serious guess, I'd say that it's because you managed to write a half-page post that was almost completely irrelevant to the thread topic. Not only that:

You're probably right. So?


I agree that these are legitimate issues, but they're very much separate from the topic at-hand.


So far, the most you've managed to do is (hypothetically) convince me *against* using Bitcoin. I suppose you'll present some counterarguments shortly.

That's still pretty damn amazing.
I remember trying to communicate exactly what it was about Dogecoin that bothered me when I first heard about it. More than anything, it just felt like a troll. It felt like a bunch of people who either felt like they "missed the Bitcoin train", or didn't understand Bitcoin and the idea of cryptocurrency generally (and had never tried to), or just didn't care and were in it "for the lulz". At some point, I finally accepted that good things could come from it (namely, the friendly and welcoming community stereotypical of Dogecoin at the time) and said "what the hell, more power to those damn Shibes".
It sounds like maybe the Dogecoin community has taken this whole thing too far at this point. It's a little sad to hear, but when you think about it, the whole idea was basically "Bitcoin - long-term serious goals + le memes". What could *possibly* go wrong?

You could start with the first page of Google, I suppose. While most of the results I find take the side of Pit bulls and attempt to defend them and dispel common myths, I'm sure that for each study I find in defense of Pit bulls you could find one preaching the opposite. Because of that, I'm not really willing to play the "post back and forth linking each other respectively-supporting studies" game, as I have other things I'd like to do today.
Likewise, while I've had positive experience with Pit bulls so far (shelter dogs, no less), I'm sure that has their own negative experience and anecdotes to boot.
So... is either one of us going to convince the other of anything here? I doubt it. All I can really say is that claim that "no smart person would have a Pit bull" is pretty damn bold, and not at all supported by my experience.

For me, it was never a competition thing. Simply put, I felt like Dogecoin was just mocking Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general. "Nerd" may be cool these days, but we still live in a time when bringing up cryptographic hashes, one-way functions, or public-key cryptography in face-to-face conversation with the majority of the general public will get you at best an eye-roll ("let's keep that mathy stuff at school, buddy!") and at worst a blank stare ("crypto-what?"). To me, it just felt like yet *another* way for people to make fun of us nerds for doing our nerdy nerd things.
As far as a "cryptocurrency lite" sort of thing, Dogecoin seems to be a great introduction for many people. In that respect, keep on keeping on, shibes.

Anybody who's into Bitcoin for reasons beyond hype over the latest USD exchange rate probably understands this already - one of the attractions of Bitcoin is the so-called "pseudonymity" it provides.

@_date: 2016-06-15 22:17:30
That's one way to look at it. Another is to consider that if Bitcoin can do ~~everything~~ a significant number of things that their local currency can do, then perhaps it's worth taking seriously. If somebody then goes on to explain the further benefits (which, admittedly, this pamphlet may not be doing so well), things that Bitcoin can do that their local currency can't, then perhaps they'll start to see things as Bitcoiners do.

A quick look at the .gif in the OP seems to be a pretty decent counter-argument to the article's main thesis, which appears to be "buses don't need seatbelts because of compartmentalization". Now, granted, I'm not a doctor, and despite the fact the passengers in the image appear to have taken some dreadfully-painful and damaging impacts, I don't know how much injury they *actually* sustained here.
Basically, I just don't buy the compartmentalization argument. Plenty of these passengers almost certainly endured whiplash (maybe we can dismiss this, since it's likely to occur even *with* seatbelts), torquing of various joints at various angles against various objects over the path of motion (which took several of these passengers beyond their "compartments"), and head or neck injuries as they either hit padded surfaces *very* quickly, or even non-padded edges like the tops of the seats. Also, isn't an abrupt "arrest in motion" the *cause* of many injuries? I don't understand why this is used as an argument *against* seatbelts, which do stop motion reasonably quickly, but more strategically with their relative elasticity and placement across the body.
The only good argument that I can see for car seatbelts being more critical than bus seatbelts is the risk of ejection through the windshield of a car. Even if that wasn't a factor for some magical reason, I'd still elect for a seatbelt in my car even though it's essentially a personal compartment, simply because the prospect of smashing my face into even a well-padded dashboard is something I'm not interested in.

I think that whether or not this is advisable is probably dependent on the generation implementation. As I understand it (although the [RSA Wiki page]( is startlingly poorly-cited, even so far as to have a broken link on it), the public key is sometimes intentionally generated with smaller numbers to allow for faster encryption and verification.
@_date: 2017-09-18 00:09:21


I don't see any goalposts being moved here. Taxation *is* theft by my definition of "theft", and I don't think that my definition of "theft" differs significantly (or at all) from commonly-accepted definitions. Your suggestion that I move out into the boonies (though somewhere that is presumably still under the sovereignty of a government) and stop making money to avoid this theft does, technically, allow me to avoid having my money stolen... but only because I'll not have any money to begin with (implied by you earlier).
Perhaps you can see why this is not an acceptable solution? If my only alternative to having my money taken is to not be allowed to make money to begin with, I call this taking of money "theft".

By the labeling of the y-axis. I mean, for as little as you can meaningfully say about this chart or "units of moneyness", it seems pretty clear that the y-axis scales linearly in those units, yeah?
@_date: 2018-04-09 15:53:40


I have, though I hadn't considered it in this conversation, and I suppose that your thinking sort of makes more sense when reasoning about it that way. However, even if moneyness scales logarithmically *in terms of something else*, this chart still scales linearly in terms of moneyness. As I understand it, the decibel scales linearly in terms of power, right (not an expert here)? So while it might make sense to say that 20 decibels is ten times as powerful as 10 decibels, you wouldn't say that it's ten times as "decibely". It's twice as "decibely", and similarly something that is 20 moneyness is twice as "moneynessey" as something at 10 moneyness, regardless of any possible underlying relationship to other units (logarithmic or otherwise).
**TL;DR**: You had a good thought, but I'm still technically correct which, as you may be aware, is the best kind of correct.
@_date: 2018-04-09 17:19:22


That's fair, and I agree that it's not a meaningful ratio (like 20°F isn't *meaningfully* twice the temperature of 10°F), but it's still a ratio, and the chart still scales linearly in terms of those units.
Let's put it this way - at this point, both this chart and that ratio are about as meaningful as this discussion.

I wouldn't say that one should assume that there *is* a greater meaning here (I agree, this seems like nonsense), what I'm saying is that assuming that something is meaningless based on a little more than gut reaction is kind of dumb.
To be fair to the chart, I think that the y-axis is implied to be in terms of moneyness, which for all we know is something that was well-defined at some other point in this presentation.

Why do I get the feeling that you're trolling? It isn't so much what you're saying, I think, as how you say it. I apologize if I'm wrong.
I could see Facebook creating wallets and distributing addresses from it, and managing private keys of other people on their own, but that doesn't eliminate the need for clients, nodes, and miners. As a consequence, it doesn't allow for Facebook to control the network. Sure, Facebook would have control over many peoples' funds, but the network could go on.
The only potential problem that I see in this sort of situation (a problem not specific to Facebook, by the way) would be that one entity controlling large quantities of Bitcoin currency supplies gives one the power to destroy those coins, if they so choose. Of course, infinite divisibility allows a smaller number of coins to continue powering the network as arbitrary quantities become more valuable, so long as some coins are out of the hands of that entity (which seems likely to always be the case), we should be OK.

I won't weigh-in on spending vs. hording, but I know that without a lot of people diving into this thing headfirst with high hopes, it will never get off of the ground.

The point is that Bitcoin, more than anything, is an idea. The current implementation is built atop the Internet, but the Internet is not the only way to relay information relatively quickly over long distances.
In any event, the fact that Bitcoin is built over the Internet does not mean that it cannot be important in ways that the Internet could not be on its own and therefore, Bitcoin may, by some measures, more important than the Internet.
Either way, I think it's silly to argue over which is more important to begin with.

So if the Bitcoin software and blockchain is simply copied, how does this accomplish a fork? After all, isn't this what's happening all the time, every day, when somebody runs a node? The fact that the Bitcoin network is decentralized means that the Bitcoin client is copied and distributed, and that each node maintains their own copy of the blockchain. I don't see how this does anything other than contribute to the existing network, without some mutation of the distributed program.

What your wallet contains (and what you want to keep secret) are private keys. What are displayed on the blockchain are public keys. Together they form keypairs.

But when I buy coins, even when they're still in my online wallet, they've obviously been transferred according to the blockchain, right? Because they're in my wallet? Or are you saying that I don't really own my coins as long as they're in an exchange wallet?

That's a shame. Own it!

That was my polite way of saying "fuck off, I'd rather not argue about this stupid distinction of 'which is more important' all day".
How about via radio communication? Radio networks display properties in common with a peer-to-peer computer internetwork. Or how about computer networks that are not the Internet? How about a hybrid of the two?
In the end, if you cannot see Bitcoin without the Internet as it exists today, I say you lack imagination. Bitcoin is cryptography, proof-of-work, and peer-to-peer communication. It is not simply bitcoind, Coinbase, and the Internet. I really don't care if you cannot see the difference, or if you don't agree with me at all. Exercise your right to disagree, that's fine.
Now, fuck off, I'd rather not argue about this all day.

I agree with you. I'm not arguing that it's necessary to be familiar with every line of code operating within your computer. AnonymousRev did. I'm simply remarking upon the absurdity of that argument. Sure, Ubuntu is largely open-source, however:
* It's big. If you've ever done a legitimate code review, you see how this would be a pain-in-the-ass as far as code familiarization goes (and that's probably a massive understatement).
* Ubuntu tends to include a lot of proprietary software within, making code familiarization that much more unfeasible.

Thanks for the link. I wasn't suggesting that the hash function itself consisted simply of truncation. My confusion stems from, despite my seeing the 256 - 160 = 96 connection, I'm a bit unsure of how you determined the number of collisions to be 2^96 for any particular key. I understand that 256 pigeonholed to 160 lops off 2^96 permutations, I just don't see how this applies to *every* key. Perhaps I misunderstood you?

I (like pretty much everybody else) do a certain amount of salivating at the prospect of owning a piece of something that may soon explode in value. However, I also understand (reasonably) and believe in the technical merits of Bitcoin.

How could it be worse than buying 0.5BTC for ~$160?
How about buying it for ~$175, as I was ready to do yesterday? How about waiting another year and buying at $1000? How about liquidating your entire stash of Bitcoins the day before they double in value?
All it takes is a little imagination. To squabble over a ~$30 difference is terribly short-sighted.

I thought that all the rage behind QE was not simply instantaneous communication, but communication at long distances. What other sort of beacon could accomplish that?

In that case, *everything* ever declared currency by anyone, for any reason, under any circumstance is fiat. Therefore that definition of "fiat" makes no useful distinction and therefore we should use a different, more precise definition. And most of us do.

How are Bitcoins associated with "dirt", if not by association with addresses that themselves are associated with certain people/organizations?
Say that Bitcoin merchants generate new receiving addresses privately for each individual transaction (perhaps they already do this, I've never paid for anything in BTC). Would this allow coins to retain anonymity and fungibility?
Obviously, this would be less effective in the event of a Bitcoin whitelist, rather than a blacklist.

How does doing something like this make you a huge douchebag?

I'll bet that if by the end of 2014 1BTC = $10000, anybody who thinks this way would be singing quite a different tune.
And please, don't equate handing out Bitcoin wallets to handing out bibles. The fact that one can have opinions and beliefs regarding Bitcoin doesn't equate the entire idea to thousands-year-old biblical nonsense. To me, that mindset could only be held by somebody who has never done their own research on the subject and simply assumes the whole Bitcoin craze to be pure speculative dogma (though some of us do a lot to perpetuate that notion).

Hash functions may seem a bit esoteric and cryptic (pun intended), especially without examples. A formal computer science background affords me an understanding (at least a superficial one) of this sort of stuff.
[SHA-256]( is a cryptographic hash function you may have heard of. The implementation details are irrelevant here, just understand that it's a function (think "f(x) = y" from algebra) that takes something in, does some stuff to it, and spits some stuff back out. An example:
Input: 
    This is some input.
    0a3e76a717c2aea07258678ee457f29e6c118965cc856fc7b8fecc5b436fc38f
That short string (sequence of characters) was run through the [SHA-256 hash function]( and produced that long string of random(ish) and unpredictable characters that have seemingly no relation to the input. You can see that a tiny change in the input:
    This is some input!
Completely changes the output:
    b57ea62b48e33fd13b518970615b0bb05561135485475548ccd21b63b67528e8
Both output sequences are the same length, but they're completely different even though the input sequences are nearly identical.
Now, here's the kicker - you cannot (feasibly) go backwards. If I give you some output:
    1288a3a6cc7d695a9424b2f4d6c8f1587b49c62ae0604bba879cc6456e77ec16
And you can correctly tell me what the input was, what I ran through the calculator to produce this hash, in a computationally-feasible (or perhaps even trivial) manner, you've broken computer security in a *major* way. This ability to very easily produce output from input, paired with an inability to do the reverse, is arguably the foundation of modern computer encryption.
So... are you now less, or more confused?

@_date: 2013-11-12 23:38:39

As technically-impressive as Bitcoin is (and it is, I think it's really cool), for a majority of people it will never catch on if somebody else, somebody important in their daily lives, doesn't lead the way.

Collision probability is certainly a problem to consider when choosing or designing a hash function. In practice, the better cryptographically-secure hash functions have a very *very* low probability of collision. In theory, of course, you're correct.

To *you*.
In my opinion, public-key cryptography is one of the most impressive creations ever conceived by humans. The ability to encrypt and pass secret data around in the open, to decrypt it without even knowing who sent it, to digitally sign and verify pieces of data, all without preestablished symmetric channels of secure communication, is fucking amazing. In my eyes, Bitcoin, a novel new application of PKC, one that may well bring PKC into mainstream consciousness, is more *beautiful* than any sculpted piece of metal could ever hope to be.
And by the way, valuing something because it's valued by others doesn't make you a robot, but in this case a user of a communal standard currency.
@_date: 2013-11-15 23:07:12
Your method of communication is much more effective than that of but you still make a lot of unqualified assumptions here.
@_date: 2013-11-11 11:28:29

What I'm saying is that "setting up" nodes seems to require software modification within the client, and this is actually supported by the example of the March fork, as the fork resulted from two separate versions of the client program working against each other.

Well, password managers offer several advantages over other forms of password management (I myself use one), but the obvious weak point, the master password, needs to be rock-solid. There are also people who immediately get uncomfortable about password managers, but the alternatives, to me, are much less appealing. Also, you sort of need to avoid deleting your login credentials.

@_date: 2013-11-19 00:46:34
It's interesting to watch the facades fall away as the USD/BTC rate nears quadruple digits. How many people here really care about (or even understand) Bitcoin, and how many are simply here for the gold rush?
@_date: 2013-11-13 03:30:29
Also, I'm going to go ahead and say this is probably the slowest-loading .gif of all-time.
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:58:55
Same here (though I would not consider myself "dirt poor"). 100% of &lt;$1000 isn't going to kill me, even if I never made it back.
@_date: 2013-11-16 00:37:20
I'm fairly confident that if it's legible to the public in *any* form, it can be made legible to humans. It either needs to be completely public, or completely private. Anything in-between is pointless. And in order to be Bitcoin, it needs to be public.
@_date: 2013-12-04 01:22:48
Oh man, if D3 RMAH paid out in BTC...
@_date: 2013-11-20 05:00:24
Because despite its userbase being an overall technically-savvy and likely relatively-intelligent bunch, Bitcoin is still very new, and most of us don't really completely know what the hell we're doing quite yet.
Growing pains!
@_date: 2013-11-20 04:36:58
And I *just* bought at ~$550.
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:16:48
That Bitcoin could not function without the Internet.
@_date: 2013-11-10 09:59:54
It's nice to work around other reasonably-tech-savvy people. They may not all agree, but at least we're (relatively) well-informed.
@_date: 2013-12-04 20:34:08


I think that really depends on *why* early adopters are early adopters. Assuming that early adopters deserve more Bitcoin because they're *obviously* more visionary than anybody who didn't adopt early seems incredibly short-sighted to me.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:39:57


Anybody else getting this from Coinbase?
@_date: 2013-12-08 01:53:18
That's what happens when you're misinformed or in this for the wrong reasons, I suppose.
@_date: 2013-11-13 00:55:42
What else should people know?
@_date: 2013-11-10 09:16:51
You're not, I should have said I bought 0.5BTC when the exchange was ~$316/BTC. Or rather, I bought 0.5BTC for ~$160. That makes more sense.
@_date: 2013-12-06 16:45:48
If Bitcoin fails, it won't be due to lack of technical merit.
One cannot control the system directly, and I don't see how that has changed, but some people tend to be malleable in the worst ways. Though you may not be able to control the system itself, you can convince people not to use it, and some people are easily convinced.
As long as most peoples' motivations and knowledge regarding Bitcoin are all wrapped up in its exploding value, many of them won't be compelled to ride out the rough times, to weather the storm. They'll be frightened off at the first sign of trouble. I think we're seeing a lot of that right now.
@_date: 2013-11-27 04:18:28
But you cannot lock in an exchange rate at Coinbase, right? Be careful.
@_date: 2013-12-30 09:41:31
You'd think the whole 140-character thing would ease reading comprehension.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:29:56
@_date: 2013-11-13 00:59:28
Does this involve anything more than running Bitcoin-Qt?
@_date: 2013-11-15 01:15:36
What sort of int is "false" anyway? Is this a C++ implicit conversion or something?
@_date: 2013-11-13 02:38:46
All right then, I'm good to go :)
@_date: 2013-11-21 04:17:13
And perhaps you underestimate the difficulty of code reviews...
@_date: 2013-11-21 16:20:02
I run it just because I'm technically interested in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-15 22:14:56
You people are so twitchy. Ebb and flow...
@_date: 2013-11-21 21:52:43
So you felt like you should make a relatively-detailed response to a post you willingly neglected to understand?
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:07:39
Fuck off.
@_date: 2013-11-10 08:01:50
I do want to get in on that, I'm just not big on sending random people photocopies of my ID over the Internet, and the closest actual "local" traders are quite a few miles away.
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:36:55
Remember, the USA is one person, with one mind, and one opinion.
@_date: 2013-11-14 04:13:58
The closest is a good fifteen miles away, and after that it probably doubles. I'm not all into the Craigslist-style meet up anyway.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:22:01
I have 0.5 as well. Just waiting for a crash...
@_date: 2013-12-04 20:11:39
Yes, very easily in fact. That's one of the big advantages to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-08 16:44:20
23, at the tail end of earning my BS in CS. I'm not broke as shit, but too broke to afford a Bitcoin at this price. I really want in, but it may be too late for me. Only time will tell!
@_date: 2013-11-16 09:42:11
We, like all people, are irrational to varying degrees. People here have more of a vested interest than most, and tend to act emotionally to anything interpreted as unfaith or dissent in that interest. And sometimes, it does feel like a trap; while those in this subreddit know more than most others about this system and have the most to teach, they also have the most to gain, the most to lose, and the most motivation to lead others astray. If impartial advice is what you seek, you are in the wrong place.
@_date: 2013-11-27 05:23:35
Is that you, Cosby?
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:54:32
And until you understand Bitcoin, there is no difference.
@_date: 2013-12-02 21:27:06
At a high level, hash functions are functions that take some variable-length input and produce some fixed-length output. They usually operate on general character sets, and small, seemingly trivial changes in input tend to cause wild and unpredictable changes in output.
From a cryptographic perspective, the best hash functions tend to be one-way; that is, it is computationally-trivial to use the function in one direction, while deriving a pre-image through an inverse function (getting the input from the output) is computationally-infeasible. As it happens, I cannot actually provide an example of a hash function that is *not* one-way, though some are tougher to reverse than others.
Hopefully that helps your understanding a bit.
@_date: 2013-12-02 23:54:10
I won't argue with that (due to personal ignorance, mostly), but I don't really see how this makes a comparison between Bitcoin and tulips fair.
@_date: 2013-11-21 23:20:08
That's decentralization! No trust required, extra resilient!
@_date: 2013-11-21 20:50:50
Gee willikers mister! My first Bitcoin tip! Thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-17 11:54:59
And what's wrong with that? Sure, the wiki article isn't great, and there seems (upon cursory inspection) to be much more emphasis on pop culture references than actual technical detail, but what's wrong with people looking for an easily-digestible introduction to the concept? Perhaps I misunderstand you.
@_date: 2013-11-15 05:56:46
Sure, analysis can be performed and predictions can always be made, but addresses cannot simply be blacklisted, especially if they're never reused. What's the point of analysis if it gets you nothing?
@_date: 2013-11-21 02:04:15
Thanks for the subreddit mention. I'm no expert, but perhaps I'll spend some time over there and try to help out some newbies with what I do know.
@_date: 2013-11-16 00:45:59
No kidding. What's wrong with you people? Chill out.
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:42:18
I've been waiting nine days on my first purchase. Unable to buy anything else from them in the meantime, I've watched the price double.
Hurry up, damn it!
@_date: 2013-11-19 16:00:06
Fair enough. And plant I will!
@_date: 2013-12-02 22:48:27
Thanks! I hope it clears some things up. Hash functions are huge for data encryption and computer security in general, and Bitcoin itself is a very novel and interesting application of cryptography.
@_date: 2013-11-23 20:47:41
I think around here you'll find that most people make the distinction at government-backed and centrally-controlled, the real important things to many people.
@_date: 2013-11-23 20:59:04
Fair enough, I suppose. Somebody else with more economic experience should probably weigh-in on something so pedantic.
@_date: 2013-11-17 01:41:56
CoinValidation or CoInvalidation? Is one a joke off the other? It seems like there is no concensus.
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:34:39
And I'll be waiting with cash in-hand, ready to buy :)
@_date: 2013-11-12 04:06:11
Hence, offline. I don't mean simply not remote, or not connected to the Internet, I mean sitting in a box in a closet.
@_date: 2013-11-12 16:22:40
I'd like to believe it (as the soon-to-be holder of 0.5 BTC and possibly a whole in the near future), it just seems unreasonable and unsustainable. I guess we'll have to wait, hold, and see!
@_date: 2013-11-27 05:24:45
Perhaps I misunderstand how recurring payments typically work, but why couldn't recurring Bitcoin payments be implemented client/payer-side?
@_date: 2013-11-21 19:34:35
You apparently don't get subtle, so I'll say it again: I never argued for finite supply. I asked you to convince me of infinite supply, but instead you give me a bunch of unsupported assumptions, nonsense and "imo". That's not convincing, at all. All you've said is "you can't prove that it's finite, so it's infinite". That doesn't work.
Anyway, this whole thing is stupid. You're apparently into just saying things without supporting them, so I'm done.
@_date: 2013-11-21 21:28:04
That's funny until CoinValidation takes over.
@_date: 2013-11-15 16:53:36
I'm going to assume that your anger stems from legitimate concerns that you have with Bitcoin, and that these concerns are based on the personal identification involved with a lot of people who are buying into Bitcoin. Correct me if I'm wrong.
Based on that assumption, I have a couple of questions for you:
* How do you feel about people who obtain coin through other, more private methods (such as LocalBitcoin and other sorts of private exchanges)?
* Even if the government, today, somehow managed to stop all exchange from fiat to BTC from this point forward, there is plenty of coin out there, more is being mined all the time, and private exchange could still occur (as this is what BTC was built for anyway) and is in fact occurring all the time. With that in-mind, what power does the government really have over Bitcoiners?
@_date: 2013-12-04 08:48:07
Well, I suppose it depends on the implementation. After all, the March fork proved that program mutations *can* affect the entire network. Depending on the severity of the mutation, I can see it being possible that a majority of clients (or perhaps all of them) may somehow be tricked into playing along.
Is it possible to destroy the network somehow (theoretically) without a traditional control of majority processing power through some retroactive (affecting previous "canonical" releases of the client) duping of the client software? Interesting to ponder...
@_date: 2013-11-10 04:45:50
Too bad Coinbase limits first purchasers to one purchase at a time. I wish I could buy more now!
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:14:43
The primary reason that dollars are more useful that too few people accept Bitcoin's potential, and too many people think like you do.
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:54:27
I don't disagree that Bitcoin is a better alternative, I just have a hard time believing that some of the people who stand to gain the most from the corruption from the dollar are all of a sudden willing to just give up on it and move on to that "newfangled magic Internet money".
Either I misunderstand what is being said, or I simply don't believe them. I'm staying skeptical.
@_date: 2013-11-14 18:20:58
Right. I'd rather have ammunition than gold.
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:24:00
It is clever, and would be nice to see.
However, I imagine that this arbitrary problem was chosen due to the level of control and predictability it offered the system.
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:32:37
21,000,000 BTC in the wild is starting to sound a little high...
Ease-of-use (or lack thereof) may be Bitcoin's primary adversary for mass adoption.
Prediction: If Bitcoin ever sees mass adoption, every single mainstream-successful Bitcoin client will have at least one feature in-common: automatic wallet backups made immediately after *every* transaction.
