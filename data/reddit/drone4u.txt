What's the advantage of a recurring buy? Also, do you think BTC is bullish now?

Is that enough to convince your average consumer to use Circle though?

Circle would let me buy bitcoin and use it like cash online. I don't see how this is different than from what Bank of America or Discover already offer.
I love Bitcoin, but I just don't see how Circle is going to convince others to switch over beyond promotions and giveaways.

Yeah, that does make sense. In any case, we'll see soon enough once they start sending out invites. By the way, BTC on the rise today!

Well don't Canadians already have good options in terms of credit/debit cards?
@_date: 2014-05-20 14:21:28
Hmm okay. I just find it hard to believe that that will be a selling point for consumers. It just seems like the next wave is merchants, not consumers and that Circle isn't changing that.

Looks cool, but why would mainstream users switch to Circle when they can use their credit card for free?
@_date: 2014-05-16 20:45:02
Right, that's going to be important. I guess my main concern is really how Circle is going to draw non-Bitcoin users into Bitcoin. How to get them interested in the first place.

What would the advantages be besides low transaction fees for remittances?

How so? Can you elaborate?
