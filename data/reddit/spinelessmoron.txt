Great Job!

Good Job FinCen.  Fucking Dicks!
Doesn't take much for the Federal Reserve Good Ol' Boy network to scare the fuck out of everyone.
Don't worry, your individual names have been added to the blockchain so when bitcoin is the default currency in 10 years you can go to prison for life for crimes against humanity.

Confirmations of transactions from a miner is a valid way to accept "such de-centralized convertible virtual currency from one person and transmits it to another person as part of the acceptance and transfer of currency" given that miners confirm the transactions and THAT is how bitcoins are "moved" from one public key to another.
Clearly this "guidance" is open to interpretation.
@_date: 2013-06-05 02:51:58
I wouldn't really even say bitcion is a deflationary currency.  It is only a deflationary currency compared to others.  
However, if the world only used bitcoin as a value exchange, why would it go up in value tremendously.  People HAVE to have  homes, food, cars, etc.
They want to have many things, services, etc.
They will spend.  I would call it a "natural" currency.
@_date: 2013-06-01 13:49:27
People write on money all the time.  I don't know.  Maybe just a simple "bitcoin".  So many people have not even heard the word.
It is a very simple way to get them to see it.
@_date: 2013-06-05 03:39:25
As a matter of fact, why the 20 year loan.  This is ONLY done to pay off MASSIVE amount of interest tacked on to make bankers rich as hell at everyone else's expense and account for printing so much new money. 
Why not a 5 year loan only returning 1 1/2 the amount of bitcoin the "bank" loaned?  This will result in a LOT more loans over a shorter period of time but mostly just successful loans.
@_date: 2013-06-01 18:07:03
I would say the best thing is "IF" bitcoin succeeds, which it is looking strongly like it will, the money you have in bitcoin will likely grow a LOT.  
It will definitely not shrink in value like the US dollar does.
@_date: 2013-06-01 16:13:59
The companies are forward thinking.  Bitcoin is forward thinking.  They may just go together.
I love this.
@_date: 2013-06-01 18:53:59
It is also a world currency.  So for example, when the world starts using it as a default currency, governments should, in theory, start to organize less around nation states...imo.

Hell the short term value seems to be approaching zero.  Somethings afoot and there seems to be fear in the air.
Why are price talk posts being deleted?

I just showed you the new rules above and provided a link but you chose to ignore them.  As I said, you can bury your head in the sand if you like but I don't prefer to do that.
235711 made an even better point.
@_date: 2013-05-29 20:04:59
Perhaps they believe folks should anticipate the laws they are going to enact so you can avoid getting jailed retroactively.
@_date: 2013-05-29 20:29:55
This "guidance" is really just new rules applied to virtual currencies using old terms.  
The statement below can easily be interpreted to mean any miner that confirms a transaction:
"In addition, a person is an exchanger and a money transmitter if the person accepts such de-centralized convertible virtual currency from one person and transmits it to another person as part of the acceptance and transfer of currency, funds, or other value that substitutes for currency."
Time to jail the miners.
@_date: 2013-06-01 20:39:55
Jesus Christ dude.  You're scaring the hell out of people.  
Create a paper wallet for you savings/investment and do everything else with electrum or something such as that.  
Pretty soon, we'll have VERY safe wallet stores in trusted online vendors.  Until then...paper/offline wallets for savings and everything else, don't put huge amounts in and use a safe computer or at least try not to get spyware on your box.
@_date: 2013-05-29 00:00:53
Yeah I think coinbase is best to convert between BTC uBTC and mBTC.
@_date: 2013-06-01 22:27:21
That is a VERY good sign.
I wonder if we could get wikipedia to do the same.  Much bigger target.
@_date: 2013-06-05 03:26:09
A bitcoin economy has NOTHING to do with decreased lending.  You simply won't have banks, as they are today, lending.  You will have bitcoin collectives lending.  
Why will they lend as opposed to holding onto their bitcoin?  Because they will get more bitcoin in return if the investment is sound.  This also incentivizes ensuring investments ARE more sound resulting in far fewer foreclosures and failed businesses.
@_date: 2013-05-30 06:27:59
Make sure all the FINCEN names are recorded so in 10 years when Bitcoin is the Default world currency they can be prosecuted for crimes against humanity.  This video, all names and actions should be recorded for evidence purposes.
Someone also needs to start gathering the names of their bosses that lead up to the Federal Reserve so they can be FULLY prosecuted and publicly exposed in the coming years.
If they think Bush is afraid of leaving the US now for these reasons, just wait until the US and humanity learns of the crimes the FINCEN lapdogs are committing for their bosses at the Federal Reserve.
It's fine to feel cocky now while you're in power, but even the mightiest of kings will likely fall in the coming years.  They should heed that warning considering HOW FAST things move.

If reddit would do this, I wouldn't care if they took some of the transaction if they don't already.  If they do, they could take more.
This would be GREAT for bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-06-05 06:18:46
Its already working.
@_date: 2013-06-05 14:35:40
Make a paper wallet.  Go to Coinbase.  Link your checking account.  Buy a bitcoin or two and transfer the coins to your paper wallet.
That's what I did.
@_date: 2013-06-01 18:50:36
Until reddit adds a bitcoin image and tip button.  That would be very nice Reddit.
@_date: 2013-05-29 20:02:44
I especially like how they create brand new rules and don't notify anyone about them but start enacting penalties and jailings immediately.
@_date: 2013-05-30 04:10:36
So it looks like America is influencing the Australians to use Draconian measures.  
Make sure you complain to other Aussies and ask them how they like being America's bitch.
Canada had the balls to stand up to their pressure.

Bitcoin currently will help police investigations in my opinion.  All transactions are recorded.  It's not hard at all to follow the trail of money.  
The problem is proving someone owns an address.  But hey, they have to spend it sometime.  
@_date: 2013-06-01 18:52:18
It is the only money with a limited supply and you can send value instantly around the world with very little fees. 
No one can stop you and no one can take your money without your consent/stupidity(everyone's stupid now and then) or carelessness.
@_date: 2013-06-05 02:15:42
That is a very honest assessment.  
Interesting project.
@_date: 2013-06-01 18:08:30
That is if you do not buy during a crazy bubble.  I'd say the real value per bitcoin right now is around 125-135.
Anywhere in that range right now, I think is a good buy.
@_date: 2013-06-01 19:04:05
Ripple is a scam dude.  It's being promoted by the big boys for THEIR profit.  
The real subversive intent of Ripple is to make everyone believe it is related to bitcoin in some way, ride on the coattails of bitcoin, and then attempt to destroy bitcoin or make it unnecessary.  
The thing is, if that were to happen, it would be NO different than current currencies--it would just be a different network.
@_date: 2013-06-01 18:57:05
Ripple is a scam not a bitcoin exchange.
@_date: 2013-06-01 13:43:13
It can also be solved by snapshot technologies with only the snapshot hashes being kept in the "light" block chains.
In other words, the bitcoin network can decide upon 1 million clients with the largest harddrives/fastest network connections to keep the full blockchain.  Everyone else can hashes of point in time snapshots of the blockchain that can be verified against those with the full blockchain and snapshots.  
There are lots of solutions.
Most likely most people will simply use light clients though.
@_date: 2013-06-06 04:12:28
Yeah, this guy is bat-shit crazy.  This video does nothing for bitcoin but make us all look like nuts.

ButteflyLabs anything is too good to be true.  They never deliver their products.
@_date: 2013-06-02 00:42:54
Wahh...the longer it's stable the more confidence folks have in it.  
There is a lot of fear around the exchanges right now.  Supposedly there are some big ones coming online in America that are well regulated.
I think now is the perfect time to buy.
@_date: 2013-06-01 23:12:18
Well...maybe I need to scare them a bit more. 
@_date: 2013-06-05 02:31:18
Theoretically, if folks realized all other currencies were just shit money over time and the world switched over to a bitcoin economy people WILL spend.
That's pretty much the bottom line.
Will you wait a year or two to make purchasing decisions and work harder to earn more.  I think so. 
@_date: 2013-06-05 02:44:58
Ultimately all money should be is a store of value for work done or goods produced.  Sooner or later folks are going to figure out that having a group of money gods print this at their will when there is a new far superior store of value is just plain dumb.

Mt. Gox--in trouble for being an "exchange" without registering as such.  Dwolla account seized. This is new for virtual currencies.  "Guidance" JUST came out.  Litigation still pending.
Liberty Reserve was incorporated in Costa Rica in 2006 but "failed to register in the U.S. as a money-transmitting service" even though they dealt in virtual currency which heretofore had no "Guidance."  Now they are being indicted for laundering--hilarious given HSBCs scale of laundering.
You do realize this is all documented right?
Anyhow, I'm done with our conversation as your mind is made up and I'm getting the impression that if every miner in the US were thrown in prison you'd still think the way you do.
Take care.
@_date: 2013-06-02 15:53:04
This is what happens when the govt. scares the hell out of new investors.  It doesn't help that the verification process to get on Mt. Gox takes was made more difficulty.
@_date: 2013-06-05 03:17:46
Then you just ignored it.  Your mind is made up so it really doesn't matter.  Good luck.

@_date: 2013-05-30 04:49:46
If they really supported bitcoin, they'd let US users use coinbase to buy Many at a time w/o taking forever.
Can't hurt them if it takes forever to get money in.
@_date: 2013-05-29 20:48:17
These folks are NOT on your side if you don't root for their money.  That's pretty much the bottom line.

What I find works best for me is to buy low and sell high.  I haven't found a better trading strategy yet.  :P
@_date: 2013-06-04 22:47:35
This is absolutely true.  That is why as the bitcoin economy grows, "banks" will manage bitcoin for those that would prefer more guarantees and insurance.
@_date: 2013-05-29 20:47:08
Bitfloor.  See above.  If banks yanking support because of fear of new rules resulting in the loss of a business isn't a penalty then I don't know what is.
Is the owner being questioned yet?
How about Mt. Gox and the Dwolla account business.  Legal proceedings are  underway.  
As far as jailing goes, looks like the whole Liberty Reserve business will result in some serious jailtime.  I wonder how much "laundering" there is in bitcoin as opposed to....hmm...the proven laundering at HSBC?
@_date: 2013-06-04 00:57:37
Aint that the truth.
@_date: 2013-06-05 02:39:32
You missed the part where I said if it's the only world currency it HAS to be both.
@_date: 2013-06-04 22:54:12
I would say it makes it easy to save AND spend. I have a bitcoin savings "account" and a checking account.
@_date: 2013-06-01 13:35:01
Can you trade US dollars for bitcoin in your Ripple wallet?
Definitely a scam and a single company trying to profit off bitcoins success if you can't.
If I were a legitimate bitcoin company I'd try to figure out a a way to sue the ripple founders.  They are just like the central banks if you ask me.
This post shoudln't even be in the bitcoin subreddit.

You could try FinShaggy's Bitcoin Town.
@_date: 2013-06-01 19:05:55
Uhh...no it's not.  Ripple is a corporate endeavor being made to look like something opensource by bootstrapping it through a company called OpenCoin.
There are new technologies being developed in the bitcoin community to render Ripple unnecessary.
@_date: 2013-05-30 06:36:01
Somebody should put that document in the blockchain.

Bitcoin is the first open source money.  No one controls it and it is perfectly fair.
Bitcoin will do for money what linux did for the computer industry.
This is probably a terrible understatement.

If it's the only currency.  Which would be ideal, you HAVE to spend unless you don't like to eat.
@_date: 2013-06-05 02:42:12
The point is, lets say, over time bitcoin keeps going up.  Why in the hell would folks NOT dump other cash into it.  If this continues, who the hell would want inflationary cash.  It would become stupid to get paid in it.
If inflationary cash goes the way of the dodo you will HAVE to spend bitcoin--making it both an investment AND a common currency.
