Ok, I need to go back and read the article fully because it talked about some of this stuff, but I kinda just skimmed through it. But I will definitely do my research on it. Because I know at some point in the article I came across a quotation from Satoshi that said he wanted to make the block chain 1 mB and as small as he could for as long as he could (I didn't keep reading to find out why) lol. But I am definitely going to now. I also can't say I know what "FUD" stands for either haha

I just read an article that had something about XT in it.
What is XT?
and I have never heard of Ethereum. What is that?

I know it is so volatile which makes me nervous and I know the risks associated with it, but I'm a believer in btc and I think in the next few years it will make waves throughout the internet community. People are already utilizing its block chain technology. 
But yea I am willing to wait it out for sure. I just don't want something like SR1 to happen and have btc drop from like $500 to $70 in a matter of 5 minutes lol. But I guess we will see how it goes. I just wanted to get other people's opinion on the matter. 
I've done my fair share of research and I know its a very volatile currency. I just hope it doesn't keep continuing to fall too much and will pick back up

Yea you are right. But I do monitor btc everyday just because I like to see how its trending (whether its stable, increasing, decreasing, etc) but i'm in it for the long run. I believe btc will become something very useful within the next couple years and I'm hoping by that time it will be worth a lot of money. Especially when btc runs out ( which I think there are only like 14 mil mined out of the 21 mil that are out there) so it'll be a while before that happens. But when it does, and if people still use btc,, then prices will definitely go up.

Ok so something like keeping them offline in an electrum wallet or armory (But I'd rather not download that entire block chain, it would take FOREVER)

That's what I think I am going to do. Cuz normally I only purchase btc when I intend to use it. But if I keep seeing it climb like this, then I'll just purchase a big chunk and slowly use from that. And yea I usually put about $5, maybe $10 a week worth btc in savings just in case it did sky rocket

Yea, I always thought it would be cool to slowly invest in bitcoin, but it was dropping for a while, then this past week it just kinda spiked! But i'd rather wait until it lowers down again to buy, then wait until it goes up. But then again I don't wanna wait too long to where it never goes down and just keeps going up. Does anyone have an idea of what it will end up finally averaging out to? a lot of people think around the $300-$350 range
