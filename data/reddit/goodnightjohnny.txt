It's my understanding that it's safer to move your BTC out of a wallet before claiming a forked coin in case the new wallet isn't honest and is just collecting private keys.

Wish I could. Full node along with outbound and inbound  backups would ensure I was paying data cap overages every month

Interesting you choose to comment on the extra pieces of his/her commentary and not the actual counterpoint given.

More of a crypto in general question. Are all crypto difficulties on the same scale?

Nothing like paying short term capital gains for paying rent

And there are ways to buy tickets with usd outside of that. Unless you sell someone your private key btc forces you to pay everytime

Bugs the crap out of me when posts use that word when they mean exponential. They better hope it's not parabolic since it's headed back to zero then

You ain't wrong but that doesn't mean reddit will like it

The idea that there is one best store of value and that it is btc is absurd. This post reeks of someone in their sub-30s that doesn't understand the balance of protection of value vs growth potential as one gets closer to retirement.

Reading pieces like this pains me since those are typically least able to assume the risk are those that feel that they need to so that they can get ahead. It may work out but rose tinted glasses seem to be everywhere

How close you are to your goal retirement age should factor into how big of a portion. 
If you are only a year away you should focus on preservation of wealth to avoid a big surprise that would wreck your plans. If you are 30 years away you can afford more risk to increase potential growth. 
Always take into account as well the tax implications of crypto vs tax advantage retirement (Roth ira etc)
