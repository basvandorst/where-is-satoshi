He was referring to the recent coinwallet.eu stress test.

Yeah, but for the system to be trustless, in the sense of the whitepaper, everyone needs to do the validation on their own.

Andreas got a lot of money for, in effect, advertising their scam. 
@_date: 2015-06-18 07:25:30
We want to know how the work done with respect to number of users N. The number of transactions t is at least linear in N, i.e. t=N. Similarly the number of nodes is at least linear in N, i.e. n=N. Then O(nt)=O(N^2).

Paid shill wants Bitcoin to fail, so they would be for the block size increase, not against it. 
@_date: 2015-06-05 18:14:33
Which point? You admitted yourself that his function was to advertise Neo &amp; Bee. He realized this and still choose to take money from them. Other people would have waived their consulting fee when they realized they had promoted a scam, but not Andreas.

1) There won't be any more market tops. Bitcoin will fade into obscurity and oblivion

It's true.

the number of transactions does not measure adoption.

PoS is superior to PoW in every way. PoS is not require centralization or PoW underpinnings. The only problem PoS is the 'genesis' problem; if there are nothing at stake (in real value) then PoS is insecure. When the scheme is up to speed, it is as secure as PoW. 
I would be surprised if Bitcoin didn't move over to a PoS system in the near future.

Autonomous agents on the blockchain is the worst empty buzz I have ever seen. Not a single use case that actually make sense has been provided. There's literally no reason robots can't use fiat to pay. 
@_date: 2015-06-05 21:37:59
This has been tried multiple time... It always ends up like a ghost town. Nobody wants to spend their bitcoin when they can spend fiat.
@_date: 2015-06-06 14:33:14
Nobody is spending Bitcoin or using it as a currency. There's you answer. Simple as that. I don't know how you expect to convince people to use Bitcoin when not even the denizen of use it.
@_date: 2015-06-03 19:16:37
Yes, but this will only be successful if the malicious staker has majority stake. I.e. this is a 51% type attack.

Don't buy bitcoin unless you're ready to lose money. Bitcoin price is in a down trend.

So why the urgency to raise the limit?
@_date: 2015-05-31 21:02:36
Short answer: Nobody knows. This is currently just a plan in Gavin's head that he has outlined in his blog.
Long answer/speculation: After the fork the transactions will have to be marked with what version of the block chain they are intended to be spent on. 
@_date: 2015-05-31 20:31:08
There was no crisis before Gavin started throwing shit. Now Gavin is top fudster.
@_date: 2015-05-31 16:23:02
There is simply no urgency. Mass adoption is as far away today as it has ever been. 
@_date: 2015-05-31 14:56:40
What are you talking about. There are no reason of exchanges to not list both BTC and BTC-XT.

I really doubt they are coming back online in less than 2 weeks. They need to asses the vulnerability before bringing the site back or they'll get hacked again. There's a real possibility they are never going back up again.

I wounder if they are planning to start up a bitcoin cafe in the office lobby?

I think it's closer than you think. Remember that Bitstamp is VC funded. And VC are probably reluctant to continue after such a big hit.

Calculations on bitcoin markets estimates $5M to be 6 months to 12 months of profits. That is a very serious blow to any company. 
@_date: 2015-08-02 09:42:06
It's not going to be just a hard fork, i.e. bump on the road. This is will a major split in the project, i.e. Bitcoin XT vs Bitcoin Classic. 
@_date: 2015-08-02 06:30:42
No reason to believe it will BTC price will ever rise to the all time high. Past performance is likely the result of criminal manipulation rather than market forces.

The only 'killer app' for Bitcoin is DNMs at the moment.

Really, it isn't that much work. Getting the Bitcoin devs to do anything else than flame on the mailing list -- that requires effort. 
@_date: 2015-08-17 18:04:44


Obviously it won't. However, the mechanism for doing hard forks is flawed which the July incident indicates. Having the miner's votes does not guarantee their full commitment to XT. Hence it is a fallacy to assume &gt;75% of mining power will have committed to XT after XT-mode actives.
The point is that the July fork was fixed by direct intervention by the core devs. Even then it was a big mess. A hostile fork like XT cannot be fixed "from above" if something goes wrong.

Yes, this needs to be read by everybody on The bitcoin system really is fucked. The global payment system that has been selling, could never have existed. It was all a lie. It was a lie from the start. The system was designed (maybe inadvertently) to hide away true costs in the miner's subsidy. 
@_date: 2015-08-14 20:07:07
BitcoinXT is not a proposed improvement of Bitcoin -- it's a coup d'etat. 
@_date: 2015-08-17 18:36:22


You are aware a hostile fork has never occurred before right?
There is no proof that it will work smoothly. In fact, experience tells us that it might get messy. Experts tell us that it might get messy. It seems quite likely at this stage that people will lose money because of this.

Outside of Bitcoin is already dead as a currency. Merchants accepting Bitcoin are silently dropping support. Bitpay and Coinbase are seeing less and less revenue and are moving to more traditional payment systems. Basically, Bitcoin is not used as a currency except for a limited use on darknet markets. 
Feel free to reply with data suggesting otherwise. No 'I buy all my pizzas with Bitcoin' please.

What about Andreas Antonopoulos? He profited greatly on this scam. 
@_date: 2015-08-11 21:42:08
XT is an altcoin because there is a split in the community! The very existence of and the censoring of Bitcoin XT posts on proves this. That Bitcoin XT uses that same blockchain currently, does not imply that it is Bitcoin. Since Bitcoin XT as an entity has distanced itself from the goals and processes of the Bitcoin team, it is an alt coin. It really is that simple. 
Alt coin is not a dirty word! It has a precise meaning: a fundamental schism in the community. 
@_date: 2015-08-07 21:51:55


Just European problems
@_date: 2015-08-17 07:42:06


You are missing the point. The July fork was not "accidental". It was planned and everybody knew it was going to happen. It activated when 95% hash rate supposedly supporting the change. The problem was that a lot of people voting for the change, stayed on the old chain. 


75% is not consensus. If a 95% hash rate uncontested hard fork gets messy, a contested 75% hard fork might destroy Bitcoin. 
The point is that there is no good way to measure where the loyalty of the hash power lies. The miners aren't locked into a camp, they can switch between chains rapidly and attack mine the different chain at their leisure. 
@_date: 2015-07-07 06:36:12
People are rationalizing in fear of the DOS attacks on Bitcoin. The truth is, there is no easy fix. Increasing the block size will probably only make the DOS attacks worse. 
The network costs 3600/BTC to maintain per day, but can be brought to it knees for significantly less than that. The stress tests have proved this a fact. The situation is just unsustainable. 
@_date: 2015-07-07 10:09:35
No proof whatsoever blocksize increase will fix this. On the contrary, one would assume bigger blocks allow even more spam to clog up the tubes. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 08:27:57
Raising the block size might make it worse. 20 MB blocks makes the attack 20x as effective. The mempool reached 30 MB during the recent stress test. A mempool of 600 MB is going to cause issues.

Yes it has been tried unsuccessfully. The crux is that most people would rather have dollars than random altcoin tokens.

The internet is the single entity that runs Bitcoin. O(N^2) total network resources makes sense. 
@_date: 2015-09-22 18:54:44
I'm sorry I might not have been clear. 
states that number of transactions t=O(log n), where n is the number of users. This is obviously wrong. 
@_date: 2015-09-20 06:42:13
Even scaling linearly per number of users is a big problem. People reported having full nodes die from out of memory during the stress test. Now imagine if bitcoin had 1 billion users instead 20,000.
@_date: 2015-04-28 21:02:03


The Bitcoin miners constitute a third party needed to verify the transactions. These miners are payed through transaction fees and the mining subsidy.


The scheme works for now because the mining is heavily subsidized. The short-sighted profit goals of the miners is both a feature and also a danger.
@_date: 2015-09-20 07:53:31


No, that's correctly modeling systems like Facebook and Whatsapp. However, payments aren't really symmetric like communication channels so it doesn't really apply directly to Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-09-20 06:59:29
makes the incorrect assumption that the number of transactions per user is going to scale sublinearly. That doesn't really make any sense. Are people going to use bitcoin *less* when it gets mass adopted? 
@_date: 2015-04-30 21:23:17

People should stop listen to this guy. In January 2015 he said that scaling was a non-issue. Now it has effectively split the community.
