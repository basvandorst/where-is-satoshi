should i just pull out everything i've got now?
any way btc will get up to 17k ever again? is it all over?
@_date: 2018-01-02 15:20:29
I wish I had never invested in this. I bought in at 17k and it looks like I'll never break even at this point. fuck my life.
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:06:28
why not?
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:09:24
can you elaborate? i have no idea what that means
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:22:15
do you guys transfer funds and just leave X amount of money in ur GDAX so u have something to buy with? how much do u have sitting in ur gdax?
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:31:20
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:58:55
this fucking sucks.
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:15:17
so the 6pm mark means nothing?
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:59:08
I kinda wanna buy more if it hits 11k or 10k tonight, anyone think it's possible? Or is it better to just buy the minute it dips under $14k?
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:43:41
i dont know how to do that :(
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:16:37
im so tempted to buy right now but i dont want to buy now if its gonna hit 10k monday
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:05:38
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:35:39
why would it be safe on GDAX but not coinbase
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:46:44
but won't I make more money buying litecoin since it's cheaper?
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:08:48
why tf is everyone panic selling
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:47:21
? I wanted a crash so I could buy, otherwise I would have been buying all day today. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:02:28
wtf i was about to buy but when i press "buy" in coinbase, the listed price is 200 dollars more than the price on the dash ???
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:19:19
Can someone tell me the difference between a stop buy and a limit buy?
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:56:11
coinbase says the price is one thing, when I go to the "buy/sell" tab, says the price is over $100 more!  wtf?? and I can't get verified for GDAX! 
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:33:06
WHICH IS IT
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:08:15
1k isn't profit?
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:36:42
i pray every day
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:09:49
the problem with that is coinbase charges so much for each transaction :(
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:40:43
why are there holes?? 
should i be freaking out?
i'm freaking out
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:30:50
has the bubble popped or is it time to buy
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:04:50
no its not 
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:26:45
is coinbase over? :\
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:57:42

@_date: 2017-12-10 22:18:24

@_date: 2017-12-10 23:49:38

@_date: 2017-12-10 22:28:46

@_date: 2017-12-09 20:47:44

@_date: 2017-12-10 02:16:15
I bought at $17k as a noob but no one is eating me alive as long as i HODL
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:43:23
cuz then i have to verify identity with passport and stuff. seems sketch. plus idk how to use gdax
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:11:45
so who's right?
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:03:08
anyone think the price will crash on monday? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:40:08
Is now a good time to buy?
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:10:04
do u think it'll be lower in an hour?
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:25:36
I use coinbase not GDAX
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:24:35
why would there be an initial dip if everyone is buying lol
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:26:36
done what? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:08:33
from $150 to 10k in two months?
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:04:24
its not the same anymore at all. it's stuck and its being controlled by wall street. we're all fucked. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:18:03
it dipped even lower yesterday
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:01:10
what does this mean lol
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:42:11
you only have to pay taxes if your income is above $10k
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:05:51
so whats the point of BCH and should I buy it?
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:08:51
I don't understand what you're saying
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:48:01
I bought in at 17k. I wonder if I'll ever see that number again.
