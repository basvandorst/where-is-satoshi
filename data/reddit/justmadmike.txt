Literally looking at that view right now, from my hotel room, horribly sun-burnt. Beautiful place though. 
@_date: 2014-07-01 22:15:51
Back now. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:11:22
Way too many posts like this. Just look at the news or top reddit posts for bitcoin this week. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 14:02:57
Even though it sucks and I don't want it. Hopefully there will be too many reporters outside his house for someone to break in. He needs to cash in a million and get some security.

That's why it's good.
@_date: 2014-02-25 18:29:26
If that was really the case why don't you just make a post containing information which is useful (reason for delays/firing of support staff) instead of getting us to worm that information out of you. Then provide proof you are in fact support staff, without proof nothing you say really matters.
@_date: 2014-07-16 00:14:16
I just posted the link dude. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:07:48
They're promoting the reddit, not the worst thing in the world but the timing is terrible. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 14:06:57
Doesn't sound like he's interested in proving it. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:24:53
Fox business is smashing it. Good work. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 12:23:14
I can't find that, link?
@_date: 2014-02-26 12:19:14
The agree page doesn't work, it was like that yesterday too. Just go straight too [bitcoinbuilder.com/]( root
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:42:52
Great to see all the news headlines like this one. I think the community and the big players did a good job of steering the media this way as soon as possible. It seemed to have worked. 
@_date: 2014-03-04 11:09:21
Down then up up and away. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 21:44:18
We all expected him to be seriously harassed by the media so I wouldn't be surprised if this is legit. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 14:16:22
If he cashes out his bitcoin. Which confirms his identity. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 10:35:35
We'll see what happens if Mark ever makes a real announcement, until then it's not really over.
@_date: 2014-02-01 21:25:15
Doesn't seen like it appears on mobile? 
@_date: 2014-03-21 18:08:59
No, they haven't. They never did. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:18:06
You're a bit late. It's already been confirmed. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 14:11:34
She could have omitted the part what she said 'the creator of bitcoin' 
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:37:44
Yes. So when there are no more rewards they will get online the fees. That's okay though. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 11:30:16
Another empty update
@_date: 2014-03-23 20:04:50
Just wanted to add that pageviews does bit equal number of users (unique visitors) 
@_date: 2014-03-02 20:18:15
It would have been ridiculous if they were to put VAT on it. Didn't expect it to go through. Glad the fact they decided not too is news worthy though. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 00:08:27
Everyone's waiting for the real mtgox announcement, but we keep getting spoon fed bullshit from Karpeles
@_date: 2014-07-01 21:54:00
CloudFlare error for me. Might be down due to a flux of traffic caused by the auction. 
@_date: 2014-03-19 22:43:40
How often do they update this and what would be the process of getting included?
@_date: 2014-05-22 23:22:57
He's not predicting anything. The chart shows we've broken out of a long downward trend. Its a positive sign, take it or leave it.
@_date: 2014-06-30 16:15:58
So what are you expected to pay for a stack of business cards? 
@_date: 2014-02-25 22:54:31
I'm getting so sick of him talking without actually saying anything.  At least give us a reason why you can't give any details right now. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 21:42:05
Who did the audit? 
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:09:09
Bitstamp and btc-e. 
bitcoinwisdom.com or bitcointicker.co

The value of a company is not solely based on their number of users. It is also based on their product and MtGoxs product is shit. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:55:58
I thought that was the name 'shadylog'
@_date: 2014-10-09 19:15:16
So. Is it any good? And have they extended it since the premier screening so long ago? 
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:22:05
That's called a query string, don't worry about it. :)
@_date: 2014-03-28 17:34:08
Like stripe when it releases.  Would be good for both companies  
@_date: 2014-02-25 11:45:59
100% fake. Look at the logo quality. 
@_date: 2014-04-24 06:04:52
Hope that's not going to be the only payment option. I thought this was going to push bitcoin adoption not be something only bitcoiners can get hold of.  
I'm hoping they can get it on Netflix. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 14:41:40
Calling so much bullshit here.
EDIT: Price 3 years a go was a dollar each, at $20 a month you'd have a lot more than 5 bitcoins. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 15:46:08
Hey dude, think you just need to read up on what a paper wallet is
You just transfer your coinbase funds into the paper wallet, taking it off coinbase and the internet entirely. 
@_date: 2014-10-09 19:16:42
Looks like crap on mobile. Good job on the release! Was expecting more TBH
@_date: 2014-03-05 17:07:22
You need to get a life. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:05:42
Where have you been? 
@_date: 2014-03-07 13:23:54
Better than nothing. 
@_date: 2014-07-07 13:01:17
Who's Ross Ulbricht? 
@_date: 2014-02-25 22:23:30
To be fair, I'm sure a lot of people bought coins on there and triad to withdraw then immediately bit were unable. 
@_date: 2014-02-01 21:34:59
Basically you could create a new wallet address for every unique visitor and store the data you need to in a cookie.  Anything sent there would be automatically forwarded on but you could track the total amount that user had donated.  (Once they create an account this address can be permanently associated with that user)  
In the future I think this data should be used to balance web pages with less adds and premium features.
