so you think we will be touching the 200 daily MA one more time before entering a bull market?
@_date: 2019-07-16 20:24:25
i just used tradingview, opened the BTC/USD chart both on Coinbase and bitstamp (more price history) and in none happened what you described
@_date: 2019-07-16 20:53:18
It’s the daily 200 MA which is at 6k$, not weekly
@_date: 2019-07-16 20:15:48
sorry, but i don’t know where you’re seeing that. 200 weekly MA is currently at 4050$.
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:53:21
For future reference

Is Bitwala a good alternative for Blockchain.info (seg2x supporters ew)? I'd like a wallet where I can import public keys to monitor paper wallets
@_date: 2017-12-25 13:47:31
Why address invalid? Does the outcome wallet need to be Segwit compatible in order to send funds to an incoming Segwit-compatible wallet? That doesn't make a lot of sense
@_date: 2018-09-09 10:53:48
Exactly! It’s very flexible
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:45:39
I was really looking for something like this!
@_date: 2018-09-05 16:11:21
Yeah, didn’t notice it lol

are you staying up for it too?
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:03:48
bought the dip
@_date: 2017-12-25 13:43:21
Imagine you have a wallet to which you made 10 transactions. Transferring from this wallet would take a lot of space in the block. I read somewhere that electrum is able to "condense" the income transactions into one in order to pay less fees. Is this correct?

Are they good books? Are they not a collection of talks about bitcoin?

Too bad you can't come to Europe, that would be an awesome adventure. Great initiative!

I wish bisq had a bit more liquidity

Stopped reading when I saw the first alternative (it’s Changelly)
@_date: 2018-09-08 18:13:59
+1 for bitWallet, best iOS wallet. Until Samourai hits AppStore, of course haha 
@_date: 2018-09-05 13:29:14
No monero :/

Looks cool, thanks!

Holy shit! With bech32 support!
@_date: 2018-09-05 16:20:35
I really hope so. It’s the friendliest of interfaces, but in reality what is it in the crypto world?

Man, I wish we had an iOS version :(
@_date: 2019-11-06 00:28:34
and for a \~3% fee...
@_date: 2019-11-03 13:47:50
because overpaying fees sucks

Actually, if you had an EKG like this, I’d advise you to go as fast as possible to see a cardiologist, because you’re having an heart attack
@_date: 2018-10-15 18:44:07
How does one configure this? Are you able to generate sub address based off one private key?
@_date: 2018-10-15 19:29:54
A mobile one? iOS?
@_date: 2018-10-16 17:03:38
Cool discount, but I think I’ll still be buying the Coinkite’s Coldcard
@_date: 2017-11-04 05:08:36
B2X indeed is shitcoin, but where are the technical discussions on actual improvement to Bitcoin Core? Specially transactions time (which makes it impossible to use btc as a currency to pay everyday goods) and the absurd fees.
Edit: grammar
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:07:09
ELI5 please, what does this mean?
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:46:45
well, to do that you must be willing to risk it all by leaving the coins in the exchange during the fork... unless you're only doing it with a fraction of your coins
@_date: 2017-11-04 15:09:21
Use GDAX my friend, limit purchase, no fees
@_date: 2017-11-09 02:34:58
I knew already bitcoin.com was about BCash, but only today I opened the site. It's awful for newcomers who think they're investing in Core!
Edit: grammar 
@_date: 2017-11-16 01:16:17
Is that real? :/
@_date: 2017-11-06 04:25:53
Actually, I think BTC continues as the leading cryptocurrency because it was the first of it's kind. I'd much rather see technical improvements on the issues you listed. Imo, that's the way we'll see mass adoption and might be the correct steps into making cryptocurrency usable. I don't think there's much point in having it to store value. Once the kinks of micropayments are resolved, we'll see more vendors accepting BTC as a form of payment. In fact, Bitcoin can be both if done properly! Meaning, micropayments and simply store. But your perspective is also interesting and I'm glad I see a post that it's not "we're getting rich".
Edit: added a few points
@_date: 2019-06-10 19:44:15
oh man, the wait has been awful

i guess I'm a romantic guy
@_date: 2017-11-04 19:19:37
It all depends of what you wish to do with your coins. Do you need to spend them or are you just stacking? If you're holding, your current private key is pretty much compromised. I'd suggest creating a new paper wallet and transferring the funds. You can import the public key of the new wallet to blockchain.info wallet to monitor the balance without compromising security of your coins. I hope this helps
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:17:00
But having them in the ledger wouldn't give you the coins as well? If you transfer the funds to a wallet that supports b2x after the fork (and coinbase will support), I believe you'll still have them 
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:02:06
No, you don't own your private keys, the server is holding them for you. I advise you to look up paper wallets or hardware wallets.  Bitaddress is pretty easy to set up (loads of tutorials in YT). Then transfer your coins to the newly created paper wallet. That way you're sure your coins are safe. This sentence is said a lot in this subreddit and always keep it in mind: "not your keys, not your coins". 
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:20:34
Jeez, if you were drunk and bought 4 antminers, I'd secure your coins with tons of encryption ��
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:12:52
But for those with paper wallets, what would be the safest way to proceed? I sure as hell want to dump shit2xcoin, but not losing it all for a replay attack in the process. Importing the private keys to coinbase after the fork and go from there? Theoretically I'd be protected, no? Coinbase said they would be implementing they're own replay attack protection.
Edit: grammar
@_date: 2017-11-03 12:19:54
Yes, it's possible the dip gets absorbed. Plus, my bet is people will dump B2X for BTC. B2X is at almost 2000€ in futures. Doubled from yesterday!
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:03:11
Yep, that's what I read too :)
@_date: 2019-06-19 23:42:01
How does a wallet that doesn’t require your own node and non-custodial work?
@_date: 2017-11-04 14:48:00
HitBTC I believe is the only one atm. :)
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:06:18
Therefore, having them on the ledger would be safer. The only downside is that you would only be able to dump b2x 24-48h after the fork, because deposits and withdrawals won't be available for that period and if you leave them on coinbase you're off after 4h, according to their e-mail.
@_date: 2017-11-18 04:20:28
Too bad Xapo has that position, their service is nice :/
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:54:21
Just below 5000EUR. Nice time to hop in
@_date: 2017-11-04 14:55:53
Did you import the share key or the actual private key? If you only imported the public key to WATCH the balance in the paper wallet, you're fine. If you imported the actual private key (which lets you SPEND), then I'd advise you to create a new paper wallet and transfer all funds into that one. You can import the public key to watch only :)
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:02:26
i'm just buying more BTC, thanks for the Black Friday price
@_date: 2017-11-05 13:48:29
I do think Bitcoin is the future, but in order for it to thrive, it must be practical for day to day use. Micropayments are very expensive atm and take too long, but no one wants to talk about that... :/
All you see is people jerking off to ATH, which is nothing but comparing Bitcoin to fiat, but why would you want that? That's putting more weight on fiat than Bitcoin, which is exactly what cryptocurrencies fight for.
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:05:38
Is there some "literature" on how to protect ourselves from replay attacks? Atm I have some coins in a paper wallet
@_date: 2017-11-10 00:07:36
Any advise for those buying less than 0.01BTC at a time?
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:55:58
People are just hodling before the fork, which explains these prices. I believe we'll see a dip after the fork. Not sure what's next after that.
@_date: 2018-11-06 13:21:08
But the funds sent to the native seg address are not accessible through the “3...” wallet, even though they’re derived from the same private key, correct? As I understand, bech32 are not backwards compatible with “3...” address, correct?
Oh thank you for pointing that out, I must’ve read an outdated Reddit comment then
@_date: 2018-11-06 15:04:08
Actually, I was thinking about hardware wallets, which most support bech32 addresses. The bummer is securing my funds by withdrawing them from the exchange, but not being able to spend the funds, because most wallets and exchanges don’t support bech32 yet. Mobile wallets exist, but most people are using p2sh for compatibility, as are exchanges. But thank you for reminding me of secondary wallets.
@_date: 2018-11-14 16:28:09
Last weak hands shake?
@_date: 2018-11-09 00:16:29
they enabled sending to bech32 address, but almost no exchange supports deposits from bc1
@_date: 2018-11-27 12:37:48
kind Reddit whale haha 
@_date: 2018-11-11 19:31:45
Might be forgetting something, but how can the total supply available today be “.82929”? Each block rewards 12.5 right now, 25 before and 50 before that.
@_date: 2018-11-14 23:22:54
Coinbase Pro only supports sending to a bech32 address, not spending (/receiving).
@_date: 2018-11-14 14:28:58
The issuance of bonds is basically the government getting a loan for 10,20,30Y. The government will always pay, with interest, otherwise the country not longer is sovereign, therefore, one might say bonds are the safest investment.
Perhaps a more knowledgeable person might use the right terms and concepts, but i think this is the general picture.
@_date: 2018-11-05 19:41:33
It would be nice to see more native segwit adoption, though. Most wallets and exchanges support sending, but deposit is not implemented in practically none. Guess it’s a forced HODL haha 
Edit: correct me if I’m wrong, but I believe not even Bitcoin Core implemented the new addresses
Edit 2: I realised I read an outdated comment, my bad
@_date: 2018-11-14 15:31:30
Well, that’s a shocker, for me at least. Hope they’re having fun lol

is this a community approved resource to create segwit paper wallets?
@_date: 2018-02-11 23:07:42
This is what I'll be doing: use an airgapped USB Tails to create a new paper wallet Segwit address. Reboot windows, sweep my old paper wallet on electrum and immediately transfer to new paper wallet
@_date: 2017-10-31 22:54:04
so transferring is also about the perfect timing, kinda like buying. Do you have some kind of strategy to do it? Transfer at weekends or something? Or do you follow those sites and go from there? Thank you for the knowledge
@_date: 2017-10-31 22:41:21
For gdax you need to deposit fiat from the bank, right? I believe you can't use a credit/debit card
@_date: 2017-10-31 23:59:29
holy shit, just hit 5.600€
@_date: 2017-10-30 02:23:51
Is there a similar option for iOS?
@_date: 2018-02-11 23:16:03
That's precisely the reason I asked if this website was community approved
@_date: 2017-10-31 06:24:57
So the only thing that dictates transaction fees is amount of transaction in the network at that time? I believe coinbase doesn't provide the fee at the time of the transfer. They only sent me an email after confirming and there they informed the fee
