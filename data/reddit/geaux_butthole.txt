what an enormous douche bag to respond like "who cares" basically. wow.
@_date: 2014-01-02 16:28:44
Let me ask you this, are you a webmaster or own a website? It is not unethical, its a smart business/traffic move. Out of the dozens of competitor typo domains I own, I have never once been served with legal papers for doing so. 
If you owned sexyama.com, became a big brand over the next 2-3 years, start getting 5-6 figures of unique hits per day, and weren't savvy enough to register wwwsexyama.com//exyama.com//sexyama.net//sexyama.org etc. why is it unethical for me to register them and redirect them where I please? 
@_date: 2014-01-02 17:56:45
If your brand name/URL is not TM'd, its fair game to snatch up your typo traffic domains.
@_date: 2014-01-25 06:11:22
just did the same haha
@_date: 2014-06-19 20:42:58
Please let me know how to get one ;)
@_date: 2014-01-14 23:05:26
But he DID take them all and not doing as promised with them. Basically a 'soft' scam.
@_date: 2014-02-20 00:07:19
Its a scam 100% 
@_date: 2014-01-02 16:28:11
Why shouldn't I? If a brand/website is too cheap to spend $100 and buy the typo variants of their own brand name or domain that speaks volumes about their knowledge of IT//internet marketing//business.
My largest typo domain nets me an extra 50-60 hits per day to my site.

There is a head shop across the street from that bank. Good times.
@_date: 2014-01-14 23:07:14
What merchant?
@_date: 2014-01-06 18:17:33
@_date: 2014-01-14 23:04:14
theymos has collected thousands of BTC and never done anything with them as promised. please do not give anymore to this scammer.
@_date: 2014-03-07 17:57:24
9 !
@_date: 2014-01-08 17:03:55
I always shutter when I see people type it as BitCoin instead of Bitcoin &gt;_&lt;
@_date: 2014-01-02 06:54:19
You are very smart for doing so and everyone here commenting about how its evil does not know anything about the webmaster world. Keep up your great work! :)
@_date: 2014-02-03 06:00:27
why would you wan to mine using NSA/FBI/DoJ exit nodes?
@_date: 2014-02-14 22:29:32
Thanks for correcting me.
According to that chart, the most profitable scrypt is now LEAF ?
@_date: 2014-06-17 19:11:55
I really like this piece dude. I would totally hang it on my wall. Let me know if you ever plan on selling it or copies :)
@_date: 2014-03-10 17:27:54
It was not in the Newsweek or AP articles.
@_date: 2014-01-02 06:52:23
Its a smart move. You crossing them off your 'list' and deeming them 'untrustworthy' really speaks volumes about your intelligence as a consumer. Its called domain typo squatting and a SUPER popular thing in the webmaster world. 
@_date: 2014-05-07 17:39:14
As a surfer of you had NO IDEA about SR 1.0? That is odd to me..
@_date: 2014-02-20 00:24:55
Seems a little pointless to come out with this now when there are tons of sites that fill this need//service.
@_date: 2014-01-06 18:21:30
Do not use this website. It is a scam 100%. I placed an order on Dec 1st and never received anything.  **STAY AWAY - 100% SCAM**
@_date: 2014-01-02 07:10:50
Exactly the reason I switched to mining scrypt based alt coins. DOGE and MEC are funding my drinking and smoking habits =]
@_date: 2014-01-15 23:45:17
Whats the name of the bar?
@_date: 2014-03-10 16:52:01
Thanks for taking swift action!
@_date: 2014-01-02 06:50:22
lol. your .001 BTC will be an extreme loss to them.
@_date: 2014-03-07 18:04:02
Name the bank
@_date: 2014-01-02 06:47:55
It is a VERY common thing in the webmaster world. 
The most common being wwwdomain.com to snag typo'd  traffic.
src: I buy my competitors typo domains all the time and redirect them to my own sites. Have dozens of them.
@_date: 2014-01-02 17:33:34
someone who gets it! amazing :)
@_date: 2014-02-17 23:45:23
I cant wait until they reenabled withdrawals. Everyone is going to withdraw and never use them again. DEATH HERE WE COME.

do. not. feed. the. trolls. 3 day old account *yawn*
@_date: 2014-01-02 06:45:42
There is noting wrong with this tactic. Its very common occurrence in the webmaster world.
@_date: 2014-02-14 22:36:36
valid point.
@_date: 2014-01-02 06:55:10
I hope you picked Namecheap...
@_date: 2014-01-02 17:37:21
Its not TM infringement if their URL or name isnt a TM fyi. I have typo domains of sites that get 6 figures of a traffic a day (wallpapers niche), no problems from them ever. 
@_date: 2014-01-06 18:20:59
Do not use this website. It is a scam 100%. I placed an order on Dec 1st and never received anything.  **STAY AWAY - 100% SCAM**
@_date: 2014-01-02 06:48:30
this 100%. this man knows what he is talking about.
@_date: 2014-02-14 22:14:20
mining scrypt coins is most profitable at the moment. Specifically mining DOGE.
@_date: 2014-02-20 00:12:58
and it got put in a hipster bar, not surprising ! :) Gotta love ATX!
@_date: 2013-07-31 16:11:39
Because you make logos for ppl on SR?
@_date: 2013-12-17 21:01:35
imdb.com is a super authority site already in the eyes of Google. 9+ year old domain, PR 8, Alexa rank of  + They are on the 1st page for basically every movie. They do not need to care about proper URL formatting.
@_date: 2013-07-12 06:15:36
Just picked some more up @ $93.
Lets do this! I'm loving the instant feature!
@_date: 2013-12-19 01:11:51
might want to look in the mirror bro. you gay.
@_date: 2013-12-31 00:06:03
So whats it mean?
@_date: 2013-07-18 22:55:05
reread what I posted, I made an edit. you cant unblur Average Blur from PS.
edit: sure you can pretty much do anything with a super computer.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:35:20
Well then you're currently UP =]
@_date: 2013-07-18 22:39:24
Yes, actually I do. The blur from the example in the site is different. Average blur from PS is 100% the same solid blur throughout thus it would not be able to be unblurred using the method from example.
Unblur this example that uses Average Blur and I will PayPal you $20 or send you BTC.  PM me the unblurred word to claim your prize [:

slut shut the fuck up
@_date: 2013-12-26 17:43:32
You sound like an ungrateful lil prick. Your gf brother is awesome and you should support this.
@_date: 2013-08-16 08:35:21
This guy is a scam 100%. DO NOT USE. STAY AWAY.
@_date: 2013-07-18 03:14:53
@_date: 2013-12-26 02:53:23
Will it sell DOGE and LTC ?
@_date: 2013-12-31 00:00:16
you probably just deleted it.
@_date: 2013-12-18 05:10:11
So how does this work? I pay .01 BTC and you call the bar and pay for  a drink over the phone with your CC and the bartender calls out my name to come get it? 
@_date: 2013-07-31 12:39:37
typical response from sympathizers IMO
@_date: 2013-07-17 23:23:13
Adobe Photoshop -&gt; Filter -&gt; Blur -&gt; Average.
There is no way to reverse it or see what is blurred...
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:00:48
What about gold?
@_date: 2013-12-19 01:16:27
Coinbase already has the coins it gives you, they dont buy them and then xfer to you IMO.
@_date: 2013-07-12 04:43:16
i'll pour one out for a lost homie
@_date: 2013-08-27 12:58:01
Ouch. Jan -&gt; end of August. RAPE :C
@_date: 2013-07-11 00:04:59
just out of curiosity, how long did it last?
