No, my doubt is about final states.. consider a channel supporting micro-payments, or lottery, etc.

It's also possible, mistyped address matches checksum..

Let's say, no tx-fee dust will take for ever to get confirmed. To get it confirmed within couple of blocks, one can send 1 mBTC, so 604.8 BTC.
With 6 - 12 (6 confirmations, 2 blocks delay) set of such amount (12 x 604.8), it can be sustained attack forever. About 7200 btc, $1.8M @ $250 per BTC. 
20 MB block can make it, $36M.

Replace by fee should be more than original tx fee? If yes, how much? If the difference is too low (~1 bits), then it may contribute to tx spamming. 
I think, it should be at least multiples of original tx fee. For example, to replace a tx with 1 bits fee, should include 2 bits, to replace 10 bits fee tx, RPF tx should include 20 bits..

$100k per BTC in 2052, is the same as the bitcoin inflation as of now ≈$200.
If $100k happens before that, say 2048, then it is twice the inflation as of now.

$2 billion can buy about, 667 PHash. That's just retail price.
For that amount of money, I think, anyone can get 10 times better deals from ASIC companies. So, my guess would be, 7 - 10 ExaHash.
And, electricity. I think, electricity problem doesn't apply to NSA.
And, we don't need all those 10 ExaHash, but a max one thousandth, or 0.1% = 10 PHash.

Good decision, but still Bitfury is in a position to exploit the mining public. Even if they deliver on time, with the promised eficiency, still they can,
  1. Price it where your miners won't break-even in next 6 months at current hashrate. (6 months sounds good, but that's 12 difficulty rises)
  2. Increase their own (Bitfury) share of hashrate
Let's see how it goes..

Yes, we need backers, at least a million of them who can store various amounts of gold safely (say, 1gm - 1kg or more), and prove on demand (comply to audits).
These backers don't necessarily have to be miners.
No gold is shipped with BTC, but it's like, give me your BTC and get your gold.
What backer loose here? Nothing. Some people who love bitcoin also loves gold. These people do hold gold in their personal possession or in a vault.
Don't you think, $40 /BTC is a good buy, and when somebody asks 1 gm gold for his BTC, then why don't you buy BTC from him?

Yum yum.
@_date: 2014-01-05 03:22:53


hm.. what? That doesn't make sense.
Anyways, we absolutely need more manageable colloquial / casual units like, mBTC, etc., or some inflationary derivative unit that mimics $$, or other fiat currencies.
Shares were always trimmed down, splitted into 2, or more. Also, I believe, keeping a constant trade unit XAU, act disadvantageously for gold price movement.
@_date: 2014-01-17 09:21:56
Common people don't look up for definitions. Legal tender, currency, money, banks, unsecured loans, etc. They're the lost frontier for bitcoin.

I've a circle account, and thanks for 2 bitcents.
Some gold vaults here in Singapore (bullionstar) allow bitcoin payments, but they don't allow credit cards. It should be, higher credit card fees compared to their spread.

It is even less, if a miner does it..
But, that's ok. Just a publicity stunt..
@_date: 2014-01-27 02:59:36
Exactly my thoughts. I was hoping people will move to a standard, lower denomination from $100. I see some adoption now with wallet apps, etc. But this is not enough.
I used to think it (keeping BTC standard) as some conspiracy to stop Bitcoin price movement. Gold is doing the same mistake for years, with its standard XAU unit.
My point is, like shares, bitcoin should be split often, as it once moves up 10x. Now uBTC would make more sense than mBTC. 
Don't always think $$ as a standard, in India, 1 mBTC would be INR 65.
I want bitcoin.org, or other influential people think through this, and take it further towards adoption.

Yes, $100. I forgot to mention. At $1000, it would be 1790 PHash. 1.79 ExaHash max possible break even point.

I'm not saying bitcoin exchange rate always grows directly proportional to hash rate, but hash rate surely provides a floor / support.

Currency is the first app. If you remove value from bitcoin, then how would you motivate miners?
Bitcoin value will get appreciated as people add more hash power, or adopt it. Say, $1m miner converted $1m in electricity into 1000 bitcoins, then price is likely to be around $2000 per BTC..

Posting it again from my previous comment..
My conspiracy theory, but I don't have any proof. Just commonsense. I often think prices are intentionally manipulated (kept low) to buy cheep coins.
Everyone's goal is to collect the most number of coins possible. They will surely keep it at the lowest possible price to buy more coins..
Keeping it around $200 and below for long enough, would make some people give up on bitcoin who entered at $500 or above.
3600 btc/day is still a lot of liquidity.
When it is possible for them to keep at $200 levels now, it would also possible for them to keep it at $400 levels (next 4 years, 12.5 btc reward), or $800 until 2024.
Only thing that could boost price is when there is a considerable growth in bitcoin user base, and more people start to use bitcoins as a store of value..
I think, until we get somewhere between 5 - 10 million users who hodl bitcoins this would continue..
@_date: 2015-05-29 02:44:29
Even with, 20MB blocks would include as much as 36k transactions. Checking last 3 blocks (100k Trxns), for double spending wouldn't cost much at the client side.
Why checking? As a validation, to accept the block, or not.

Recent blocks get orphaned, sometimes. I know double spending is not possible for someone mining on the same chain that included in previous blocks.
Consider a double spending scenario. When a block attempts to double spend, it should able to detect it, by looking through earlier Trxns.

Not when we confirm transactions that are at least 10 mins old. Also, sort order is not based on 'last seen'.


It again depends on sort order. My point is, we need a consensus on the mempool sort order.

As said in previous comments, both verification and confirmation are different. Verification is instant (few seconds, like a credit/debit card). Confirmation takes time (~10 mins).
Beginners usually confused with verification with coin age (how long you're holding those coins). You just can not spend coins, you just bought from an ATM. You should wait for 10 mins before you could spend them. Few places, they'll also accept coins you just bought, for a small amount.

I had the assumption that miners can't / don't hide their pool info. Isn't it theft, If they split up / collude with other pool. If they hide how do we measure hashrate distribution?

No doubt, lower prices would allow few people to enter into bitcoin world, cheap coins for everyone, but it will also put sell pressure on miners. Miners need to sell more coins to pay their bills.
People with large amount of bitcoins, may sell some coins to artificially inflate current market supply, which could further put sell pressure on everyone.
Over the time we see some people leave bitcoin. More selling, prices will further go down. Bitcoin market is susceptible to this kind of manipulations as we have only a few participants (&lt;1 million).

$100 per BTC is kind of ok for instant ownership, and occasional purchases.
If you're ready to go through the exchange then sign up, transfer in fiat, buy (cheap), transfer out BTC... Takes at least a week.
Sign up is one time process, and if you keep fiat in an exchange then you can quickly buy btc and transfer out. There's a transfer out lock time.

To redecentralize, all you have to do is ship thash mining devices, to a million people (1 ExaHash). Take first 3 months mining rewards, and a small down payment to cover part of your manufacturing costs. Bet on your future profit, and subsidize heavily on initial miner price. You get the money, and everyone get the device.

You're talking about BTC in/out case. How about btc/fiat in, and only fiat out? Interest is paid only in fiat, some fund lock time (2 years),  limited bitcoin supply (but, new demands)..
When fiat flows in, we have fewer bitcoins left. With increased demand, exchange rate goes up. This cycle can continue till the lock time, after that new sustained inflow fund outflow doesn't matter (?!).

I'll explain.. in fact there's not enough demand for 10 mins confirmation.. Everyday, not all 100k transactions would pay anything to go into a block that's currently mined.. 
there's probably 5k transactions per day, that's critical and would pay $5-$10 to get confirmed within 10 mins.
When miners find a block they can include their own transactions (spam), unseen from the rest of the network.. they get the transaction fee that's otherwise wouldn't be there (no profit / loss for miners).. This also raises average transaction fee.
Critical transaction would pay more now.. and normal transactions also would pay average fee..
This would increase the miner revenue..?
Sorry if I'm not clear.. I'm on phone..

If their advertised ASIC eficiency 0.06 j/GHash is true, then they can operate 667 PHash mining..

I'm yet to read, but when a node needs to pass around this encrypted trxn, then that node should be able to see (spam?) what's in it. Which means, anyone can see it.. or, it's only as good as unencrypted..

Right, we need an 'Arduino' for bitcoin mining.
@_date: 2016-07-10 14:02:30
Yes, it'll happen at some point of time. May be, there isn't enough interest in open source mining, or people doesn't care about mining centralization, yet.

Newly mined coins can be spent only after 100 blocks.
But, a miner can directly mine to the address he specifies..

Say, we have 1000 transactions in one mempool (sorted), 900 transactions are at least 10 mins old, and were confirming first 720 transactions.
May not be a perfect / complete solution, but we just need to find,
1.the right sort order 
2.trxn age; say, 10 min
3.count; say, confirm first 80% (720, with above example)

UTXO bloat, for example; the rate at which UTXO can grow.
SW &amp; 2 MB blocks could allow 4x trxns, 12-28 tx/s. Means, UTXO set can also grow at, 12-28 utxo/s.

2 MB is going make miners rich? I don't think so. 2 MB doesn't mean 2x transaction fees.. :(
@_date: 2016-07-10 10:21:50
Yes, may be we we need a BIP to formalize this process..
@_date: 2016-07-08 05:26:56
Yes, 3. Rounding error. :)
When we add 3 more 0s, mining with rewards, can continue for another 40 years, 10 more halving (1.000 Satoshi to 0.001 Satoshi). Mining stops at 2140, because reward goes down to 1 Satoshi.

Off-chain scaling is there always. Lightning gives you on-chain scaling. 10 billion earthlings, 10 trillion IOTs can successfully function with 1MB block..
836 million tx/second, with 1 MB blocks, when half of it used for regular transactions, and another half is used for payment channels..

Of course, there should be bulk ordering and make use of economy of scale.
Think about, 1 M people want 1 THash. That's another 1 ExaHash worth of mining chips..
@_date: 2016-07-09 10:33:05
Or, you can sell even before you mine, by selling collectibles like btcc titanium blocks.
You can also directly mine (reward + fee + premium) to the preferred address, given by buyer.
@_date: 2016-07-01 01:59:03
Thanks. I'll check.

I remember 2013 story, but 25 blocks reversed then? That's 4 hours of mining..
Also, fork on consensus and bug in one or many implementations are different.

I think, million IOT mining devices cannot be equal one dedicated miner. Also, do you really think you can sell million 'mining lightbulbs'? It's easy to sell one dedicated miner.

Yes, correct me if I'm wrong. Bitfury was building 55nm ASICs that are as efficient as KNC 28nm. May be, someone with expertise can explain.




Common people, I mean, everyone who wants to get into mining.

I realized this when I had two different wallets; Android bitcoin wallet and blockchain.info web-wallet (pre-app). I had some mBTC in each of these wallets, and I could feel the difference.
Anyways, you go to an exchange for low margin and convenience. For quick purchase, you should check for bitcoin ATM, or in-person sale (10% margin) / bank transfer.

There should be a tab / option to list unmoderated posts, like hot, top, raising and controversial.
Even better, to have a moderated tab / option, and other tabs (hot, top etc) are based on unmoderated.
Just give users an option to choose moderated / unmoderated.

Yes, in 2 years we reached 110 nm to 16 nm, but at most we can go 7 nm in next decade.
We don't have to go for high-end ASICs. We can build cheap 28nm ASICs that are as efficient as 16 / 14 nm. May be, no of ASIC chips increase, but that's ok for common people. Only mining industry needs ultra efficient, oil cooled mining facility. Common people can live with cheap and efficient ASICs and cheap power.
Also, mining logic accross all ASICs should be the same, right?
@_date: 2017-05-08 03:40:16
So, segwit will happen either through 95% consensus, or UASF..?! then, there will be 2 coins and market will decide winner?
