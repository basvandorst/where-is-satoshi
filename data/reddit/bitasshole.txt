I agree it should, but the BTC market is comprised mostly of amateur speculators who do worse as more financial instruments are introduced. This market primarily exists because of speculators looking to make a quick buck and have no idea how to calculate what market cap should be.
These ~~college kids~~ "investors" willingly bought into a bubble last month. Luckily they could only lose as much as they invested. With shorting, there's no telling how much bad investors stand to lose.

It seems Redditors like to throw around the word "Keynesian" to pretend they've majored in fiscal policy, but of course then they'd know that hyper-*de*flation is just as devastating as hyper-*in*flation.
And no, business owners aren't going after an experimental coin that no one wants to spend. They have a perfectly fine medium to deal with coincidences of need.

I've found that relationship with economics leans more toward generally uninformed than recently reformed, but that's besides the point. I'm curious to find out what law of economics Bitcoin has re-written. Tell me.
When you talk about hoarding, you seem to equate "what's good for bitcoin" to "people's self-interest". Short term thinkers are bad for most economies, not just Bitcoin.
Hoarding DOES lead to deflation, which leads to more hoarding. Rising prices DON'T encourage merchants to adopt Bitcoin, since no one is willing to spend coins on any goods. The volatility (although upwards) forces any merchants that DO adopt to hardwire BTC to a stable currency.
Once the the market is saturated with hoarders and prices plateau, the incentive to hoard is gone. People will either 
1. cash out
1. spend their bitcoins with the few retailers that'll take them, then *they'll* cash out.
Both of these options will cause BTC to plummet. If speculators still rule the market, you can rinse and repeat. Only when speculators move onto the next bubble will we see stabilization.
So yes: self interest is not only natural, but also primal. But you can't get mad at people for wanting investors who can see the big picture and for rejecting those who have wet dreams about bitcoinity.org hitting an all time high.
Price should follow adoption, not the other way around.
@_date: 2013-05-03 11:57:04
That's not going to contribute to "high value BTC". The only thing that ensures a rising value for bitcoin is an expanding economy.
Price should be a *lagging* indicator of adoption. I'm glad the bubble keeps popping.

As for my supposed "straw man" - two things:
1. I know it's a popular fallacy to point out on reddit. but you're using that wrong.
1. The reason I reiterated your statements in a more concise manner is because I was building a foundation for the crux of my argument. 
Anywho, our disconnect happens here:
I'm saying that since a hoarder's only incentive to hoard comes from a rising price, once the price stabilizes there will be no more incentive for the any hoarders to hoard. I believe you labeled this as thing  (sharp decrease in demand).
And retailers will gladly still accept bitcoin on the way down, but they'll immediately cash out every transaction as it happens, plummeting the price even further.

It's not great. People need to realize how little they know about economics and how shallow the learning curve is. Uneducated investors kill markets. Bitcoin CAN be successful if people just use it as it's intended (form of payment).

This post is irresponsible at best. Let me translate:
* Reason 1: It's a gimmick. Bitcoin enthusiasts are so desperate to make it work that's they'll jump through hoops and make uneconomic decisions just to say "look what I bought with BTC". [Example](
* Reason 2: This reason actually presents it's own counter-argument: Credit cards are conveniant, but cost more money. Luckily, the author explains that people are willing to pay for convenience? Checkmate, yourself?
* Reason 3: Buy into the bubble. And help pump it up by telling everyone else what a great chance they're missing!
* One lesser reason: Costs. Like I said before, credit cards cost money. Normally, businesses factor that into their prices - but you should actually experiment with a volatile currency (there's negligible fees!). Don't think too hard about this or you might realize the transaction costs simply are redirected into cost to exchange currency.

I've explained over and over how speculation leads to over-valuation, which starts a bubble due to the hoarders. Here are the details copy and pasted from a discussion I had a few weeks ago, the day before bitcoin crashed:
When you talk about hoarding, you seem to equate "what's good for bitcoin" to "people's self-interest". Short term thinkers are bad for most economies, not just Bitcoin.
Hoarding DOES lead to deflation, which leads to more hoarding. Rising prices DON'T encourage merchants to adopt Bitcoin, since no one is willing to spend coins on any goods. The volatility (although upwards) forces any merchants that DO adopt to hardwire BTC to a stable currency.

So yes: self interest is not only natural, but also primal. But you can't get mad at people for wanting investors who can see the big picture and for rejecting those who have wet dreams about bitcoinity.org hitting an all time high.

I don't have much time, but this is probably the most informed response I've ever gotten on this forsaken website, so I'll respond with what I can.
Credit cards added value to commerce by 1) convenience and 2) easy short term loans. Merchants liked it because it allowed consumers to spend money when they didn't have it. I'm not saying that credit cards were necessarily good, but there was huge incentive for merchants to adopt it.
Bitcoin also adds value, but not in convenience - especially since it lacks consumer protection. The value Bitcoin adds is anonymity and therefore outreach efforts like yours should focus on markets where anonymity is important.
You also proclaim that merchants could charge the exact same prices in BTC, which suggest the cost converting to USD is 0. It's not.
The "first-mover" mentality is the birth of every bubble. And by bubble, I mean people investing in bitcoin expecting to gain from just being first. This investment could be buying BTC on the market, allocating resources to facilitate bitcoin payments to their business, or starting any campaign to tell more people to accept bitcoin.
You're fourth point is the only unfocused one.
Now, I don't hate bitcoin; I hate inefficiencies. Bitcoin is awesome and crypto-currencies are certainly the future, but we have to be mindful of how we grow them. Let's start where bitcoins are already useful: anonymous markets and international money transfer. In the meantime, someone could design a currency without the deflation issue that we'd be able adopt on a world-wide scale.

I used pre-bubble historical prices and pegged them to potential markets (merchants that accepted BTC and how much of their revenue would come from BTC users). You get a few data points from january and february, then a bunch from years ago. From there, you can basically calculate how much an increase in adoption will affect the price.
There are a bunch of other ratios I use to validate and justify, then weigh the averages.
And that's just market cap. Calculating peaks and dips of certain bubbles is harder to get specific, but you get enough data to know when to sell.

I'm a lot of things, but a "troll" isn't one of them. I'm an asshole to scare people away from *playing* with bitcoin. I've seen too many people lose money to better ideas because of speculators and amateurs causing avoidable volatility in the market.
I'm here to keep people accountable to their wild projections.
@_date: 2013-04-11 02:32:08
Finally, some credit!
@_date: 2013-10-24 05:33:14
I'll see you at 130 on Saturday morning.
@_date: 2013-04-09 04:50:15
Well if it was permanent it wouldn't be a bubble ;)
I hear what you're saying. though.
@_date: 2013-05-10 16:33:50
Congrats: You said exactly what did, but with 5 times as many words.
I'm not here to argue about facts. If you want to believe that inflation is a measure of the change in money supply, go for it.
@_date: 2013-04-11 02:30:31
That's because wouldn't know a bubble if they were trapped in a Deep Steep bath with the blue powerpuff girl.
@_date: 2013-05-03 14:40:53
Aren't you the guy that bought at 250?
@_date: 2013-04-24 14:46:53
You're too emotional for this. You probably will lose a lot of money in the new bubble that's forming.
@_date: 2013-05-22 03:21:44
Now I know you don't have a background in finance.
@_date: 2013-05-13 15:52:44
I'm unclear in what your intentions are. You seem to be a consumer, but then you start talking about your first "trade" and converting BTC back to USD.
Do you want to buy things using bitcoins or are you trying to day-trade?
@_date: 2013-05-22 16:16:54
Looking at your overview, it looks like you could fellate king kong for BTC and not have any regrets.
@_date: 2013-04-09 01:53:54
Can you blame them? Why would you keep 1M in a highly volatile commodity?
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:39:00
I sold at $20k of my BTC at 235 (before crash). I'm buying back in at the bottom.

You should read the rest; the author makes valid points.
@_date: 2013-04-24 20:14:22
Yes. Bitcoin are divisible to six decimal places, I think. Most trading sites have a minimum of .01 BTC orders, though.
@_date: 2013-10-25 15:28:08
1000% sounds random. What does $44,000 *really* mean? Smart financial goals are informed by value. Maybe your goal would be the value of 50% of your student debt, or the first 5 years of payments on your new condo. Something like that.
@_date: 2013-10-18 16:20:13
Bitcoin does it best.

You consume more than you need to and make excuses as to why there's nothing you can do about corporate clout. You also sound like a drug-laden hippie.
Do you want more?
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:23:30
Why? It has the most options and can handle the most people. Any of the other exchanges you listed would fold if given Mt. Gox's traffic.
@_date: 2013-04-18 02:05:11
Transfer them to BTC-E and turn them into LTC.
@_date: 2013-05-20 15:35:44
Did you just give the bot 4 months of reddit gold?
@_date: 2013-05-20 18:35:12
What does it matter? If you're going to spend them, spend them. Because prices automatically change with price, purchasing power doesn't change.
@_date: 2013-04-24 13:47:13
Great. The bubble children are back.
