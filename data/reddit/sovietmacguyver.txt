I have no doubt it will reach $1M in a few years.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:47:59
Not even close.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:26:48


Why do you think that? If more and more people keep buying it, the scarcity keeps increasing, giving it inherent value.
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:10:59
Of course, what do you think people are buying from? Sell orders. Yet the value keeps going up.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:20:27


Have to correct you. Valve actually said that volitility in currency is bad for business, and that currently that is what Bitcoin is experiencing.


That is not an inherent attribute of Bitcoin itself, but of current conditions.
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:44:33
Also 20k NZD
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:10:47


But that is happening to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:47:03
I would have been one of those people. Sold at 12.4k, then it rebounded up. I put in a buy order for 11.4k and hoped for the best that it would come back down.
It did. I got lucky, and made 8.5%.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:48:51
Just buy now.
@_date: 2017-08-01 19:50:24
What do you mean? NZ has a number of crypto exchanges.
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:53:30
Well, that would explain why my BCH hasnt shown up yet...
@_date: 2018-10-09 21:59:11
Doubt it will lower any more. This is the plateau before the next run, and has been established this entire year. Its solid.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:57:05
I always read it as Hold On for Dear Life
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:42:31
Well, thats all assuming growth will be infinite. It may be, but its not at all certain. There might be a limit.
If there is, then you have to have an exit price in mind, and that means limited profit.
@_date: 2018-02-19 19:30:33


Why do you say that? No volunteers?
@_date: 2018-02-19 21:25:01
Its not that big a cost, really. Dont see why enthusiasts cant exist purely to keep the currency running, without any reward.
@_date: 2018-02-23 00:51:09
The real answer is because people keep complaining about transfer time.
@_date: 2018-02-15 23:04:56
Honestly, this is the kind of thing that should have been picked up in unit tests.
@_date: 2018-02-26 23:03:29
If anything, the price will rise, as there are less coins in marketable supply - until they decide to do something with them.
@_date: 2018-03-18 20:14:47
Exactly this. The sale of the coins does not exist in a vacuum.
@_date: 2018-02-11 23:43:11
You need to accept that some people just want to use it as a currency, not as investment. Not everyone is like you. And also, they dont need to explain themselves to you.
@_date: 2018-07-17 20:55:28
Then literally just FUD :P
@_date: 2018-07-17 20:45:33
Anticipate your shorting, then. With bated breath.
@_date: 2018-03-08 20:07:20


Its not miraculous. For them to recover coins, others had to lose them.
@_date: 2018-07-17 21:05:54
Its not a dick measuring contest. Prices go up and down all the time. That doesnt mean this is a bull trap. You sound like you have just learned of the term and want to use it in edgy sounding ways.
@_date: 2018-04-09 20:18:24
Lol, yes, lets make terrible snap decisions to sell off on a "what if". Get out.
@_date: 2018-04-03 22:00:49


The reason for that is that banks dont need complex transaction routines via random-peer based verification, implemented as inefficient computation cycles in order to prevent gaming and enable trust (or, more realistically, consensus) in a distributed manner. Banks dont need this, as they simply agree to trust each other, with the penalty being prosecution by an overseeing regulatory body.
Its apples and oranges.
@_date: 2018-04-03 21:49:29


Because how is that definition any different to any fiat currency?
@_date: 2018-04-03 22:19:55
Thats an entirely arbitrary distinction, and not one that I think has any merit.
@_date: 2018-04-20 01:22:17
Statistically, you will never ever ever be that lucky ever again.
@_date: 2018-04-03 22:39:30
My point is that the price paid for being a distributed by-the-people network is being inefficient and arbitrarily difficult. And by introducing reward and profit into the network, you create incentive for people to game it and gain power over it, requiring it to be ever more inefficient.
Ditch reward, and let groups dedicated to the cause contribute their time and resources for no gain except to maintain the network. Its the only way to reduce inefficiency.

Those external APIs, presumably (given Ive worked with payment gateways countless times) have test interfaces of their own. An especially good assumption given we are talking about *credit card companies*.
@_date: 2018-04-03 21:49:04
That was precisely my reaction, as well. What a ridiculous conclusion.
@_date: 2017-07-31 22:42:08
~~The time on that is wrong. Its showing 12 hours to go.~~
Im wrong, its 12:20PM UTC.
@_date: 2017-07-31 22:58:22
Youre absolutely right. I was sure I saw it was occurring in the AM. Great, that makes it midnight for me.
@_date: 2017-07-31 22:54:17
You must be. Every trade Ive done has been quick and flawless.
@_date: 2017-07-31 22:49:51
The fork starts at ~~00~~12:20 UTC. That is ~~1~~13hr 40mn from now.
@_date: 2019-05-09 03:14:23
All the bitcoins I mined in 2010 on my HD4850 :/
@_date: 2017-07-31 22:04:47
Basically yes. But if you invested right now, before the fork, any assets you hold in BTC will be duplicated in BCC. So thats pretty sweet.
@_date: 2019-05-26 22:35:25
Day trading.
@_date: 2019-05-19 13:06:39
You can if someone accepts it.
