I know but damn its fucking crazy he only sold 18k and caused the market to crash more than 60% what about the 166k left will it bring BTC to 1k$?  Its only $1.7 billion.. Someone buy this damn bastard coins...... Bitcoin was worth 400B+ and was loosing and gaining billions every single day cmon.

fiat value stays fiat..... I don't think you will appreciate loosing hundred of thousands of $ per day. If bitcoin keep going up that's fine but right now its deceiving.

Unfortunately its true there is indeed fast better scaling currency option but fuck'em Bitcoin will eventually become better it was the first cryptocurrency and it was made by an *anonymous unknown person* this why it's important. **Bitcoin is a legend** and a flipenning will kill cryptocurrency fuck atlcoins! There's only one internet currency and *Real People* don't want the main currency where we know the name of the creator it's like when you think about Bcash do you want this ROGER VER coin rule the world? Nah. So that's the point with Bitcoin it's like its created by God, a no man-made thing and that's why we love it.
