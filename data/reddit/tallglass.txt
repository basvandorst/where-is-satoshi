I had been having a look at bitcoinstore, But shipping to the UK makes it sort of redundent. So I may considered cashing in and adding the extra to a CPU I had been looking at. Since its atleast 1/3 cheaper on Amazon.

Help out in which way?
@_date: 2013-06-19 23:45:37
Thats the one. (Phone decided it was a great time to autocorrect)
I have been using blockchain (Although nothing is it in since mining with my GPU is slow)
But I'm glad I haven't chosen a particularly bad wallet.

Now I'm confused.

Well once again thank you very much.
Don't want to turn the bitcoins into cash but so many worldly temptations it would help with.
@_date: 2013-08-23 02:25:33
Could you ELI5 since you have clearly done a bit of research?
@_date: 2013-08-23 02:33:05
I think the bitpay option sounds easier...
I think I will go with that.
Now to get the website sorted I guess! (Not the fun part)
@_date: 2013-06-19 23:38:42
And now I have more knowleage in life
Thanks you.

They are still in wallet linked with reddit by default.
As soon as I can find something worth buying in the UK with them I shall.

Just reading it. Certainly not liked from what Im reading.
@_date: 2013-06-06 00:18:14
I'll be honest. I have no clue what's going on right now.
@_date: 2013-06-19 23:35:50
Ah a big Balance button!
(I need to use reddit on the PC far more often.)
@_date: 2013-11-28 05:08:15
Even now my GPU cant mine shit. But then againnits a few years old.
@_date: 2013-07-09 23:29:10
I have no doubts that's true.
@_date: 2013-06-19 15:59:53
I think I've been using bitchain on the basis of its "cloud based" Guessing thats not the best idea? My HDD have an habit of failing.
@_date: 2013-06-06 01:04:41
I think you just have me $36 worth of bitcoins. I have never felt so confussed. The diazepam I've been taking me not be helping me either.
@_date: 2013-06-19 23:36:41
You did indeed. Im not sure how I feel about having my virginity taken for just $5
I suppose I feel like a cheap whore.

Which bank is it?
Just so I know which of the 7 bank accounts I hold NOT to use for any transactions
