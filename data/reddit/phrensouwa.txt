Paypal froze 100 000$ in reservation deposit for a resort located in Québec, allegedly because of its name : Club **Havana** Resort.

because it's easier?

I think if a system relies on the fact that it is secret, it's just one more possible flaw.

Genuine question, were these currencies started from the same genesis block as bitcoin and bitcoin cash?

So this is basically the bitcoin equivalent of taking a picture with today's newspaper. This is great. In any case, thank you for the explanation.

Thanks for tagging me to this post. And here I am still procrastinating a year later. I ended up ordering (what I choose to believe really is) titanium plates from China on eBay. 
I've got the letter punch set ready, but before I punch the private key I want the plates laser engraved on one side with the public key in hex, and the address in base58, and the address in qr code.

Wait, I did exactly this a couple weeks ago and only received an email telling me I would received the Steam code ~~on launch day~~. Am I missing something?
edit: I was mistaken; my Steam code was simply in the *Games* section of my profil page on GMG. Preloading at this very moment. Also, first purchase ever with bitcoin!

Exactly, by demand for work(security).
