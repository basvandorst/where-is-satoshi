No, you do not have to put any BTC if you do not plan on spending any. (Or if you plan on spending some only after you get some first).
The idea here is that no one can have a negative balance at any given time. However, with enough nodes, cash flow should be very flexible within that confine.

Right, but they can handle 8 times the txs, so the fees will be a lot lower for the same throughput, always.

At 10 minutes a block it's exactly two weeks. Practically, mining power is going up slowly but surely, so a bit less then that.

If it helps, OP literally is talking gibberish. How clogged the mempool is has nothing to do with miners. You get X transactions per block, and one block every 10 minutes. Miners can't really "mine harder" to change that.
(Technically they can temporarily get slightly faster blocks but the difficulty will always readjust so you're back to 10 min blocks).

I give the bank 10k. They now owe me 10k. Bob asks for a 10k loan. They give Bob the 10k. The bank now does not have the money to pay me back. This situation cannot occur with LN

Not being able to trade a coin increases it's value? Is that the statement I'm reading here? And what pump and dump? BCH value has been steadily rising with random peaks and valleys same as any other crypto.
I get that Roger Ver is a guy you don't like but I don't think he's some kind of shadow master that has an evil plan for ultimate BCH domination through means of taking over exchanges and executing the cunning plan of "selling other currencies but not my currency that I want people to buy".
Just for the record, is the evidence for all this simply the fact that Coinbase, god forbid, supported a 2MB bitcoin?

Dude bcash is literally a branch of BTC with bigger blocks. Bigger blocks mean more transactions. It was literally forked to solve the problem of high fees. Whatever your criticism of BCH it will never have higher fees. Hell, nothing is even stopping BCH from developing a lightning network too.
This is just a stupid accusation that is not only completely unfounded (like most conspiracy theories on this sub) but actually COUNTERED by facts.
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:05:05
They don't even let you trade BCH. Pretty sure that 10 steps before "sabatoge other currencies" on the support BCH list.
The amount of conspiracy theories on here really is not a good look. Wonder how much that scares away new guys. Scared me away for a long time.
@_date: 2017-12-29 06:18:24
In isolation you are correct. However keep in mind the idea is a lightning network. If one of the two channels is also connected to another channel that does have BTC, money can come into the original channel from there.

If there are a lot of people purchasing something just because they assume the price will go up, that's always cause for concern. On the other hand:
a) A built in hard limit on a commodity has never existed and seems to me would make any product much more resistant to any bubble popping
b) let's not forget for every bubble there are always people making tons of money by just buying early enough or selling early enough 
Which time is now? That's up to you to decide.

Oh damn, that's unfortunate. Is there really no way to have your private key but still have the wallet be software?
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:44:39
I'm referring to the fact that they give you a private key and have the same recovery passphrase as any hardware wallet does. Is there some implementation difference that makes recovering one different the recovering the other?
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:17:14
Yeah, all this is operating from the point of view of "I want to hold bitcoin because I assume its a good investment".
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:23:03
This is solid advice. You can wait and hope for a dip, and a dip will eventually come, but unless you have a specific reason to think a particular dip is coming its more prudent to just by as soon as you can. Like even take this last big dip. If you waited when the price was 6k, you might have been able to buy at 5.5k and make a bit more money. But if you did the same thing but waited earlier, when the price was 5k, you just lost money. Which of the two situations is the current price? If you don't know then you have to assume the general rule of sooner = cheaper.

What's LN?
@_date: 2017-10-03 16:05:49
What if you don't care which community wins and just want the most value out of your bitcoins (which is the silent minority I'm willing to bet). Then you want replay protection as that means you've got both sets of coins. Even if one coin drops to 5% the value of the other, I would like a free 5%.
@_date: 2017-10-03 16:52:21
Interesting. I'm reading this as LN is more of a framework for how to make coins rather then a specific coin, is that correct? If so, are any there any implementations close to being made right now?
@_date: 2017-10-03 16:38:08
It happened with BCH so it's surely possible, right?
@_date: 2017-10-03 16:49:45
Actually now that I think about it, the price drop isn't relevant. My point is more if you had BTC before the split, and you decided to just ignore your wallet in one fork or the other, you would have less money then if you leveraged both.
