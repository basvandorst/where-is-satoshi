Lmao, wow man. No I didn't say the Internet was a bubble because it wasn't something you buy and sell. Internet stocks though, yeah I said those were a bubble then, and they definitely were and the bubble most certainly burst just like bitcoin. If you can't see this is a bubble, I'm sorry.

I'm yelling timber

I get what you're saying, but the headline that bitcoin has rendered finance companies obsolete is fucking stupid.

Says the guy in holland who thought tulips were the next big thing
@_date: 2017-09-09 07:49:21
yes bitcoin is way way way up over the past couple months. Exactly my point. It's a fucking bubble. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 11:13:13
I just think it's a shitty asset and in a bubble.
@_date: 2017-09-09 12:26:08
What do you think champ?
@_date: 2017-09-09 04:02:07
Just sharing my opinion sir.

I have a phd in market making from Stanford and a masters in anal from Berkeley

500:1 to fuck this stupid asset for me
@_date: 2017-09-09 05:03:33
lol you're so blinded by your delusion. I don't hate bitcoin. I stated it's cool novel tech. You get triggered by me suggesting the price of them has gotten out of hand and into bubble territory. Deep down you must know it's a bubble or you wouldn't be so sensitive. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 04:07:48
Sure, if you wanna support and contribute to bitcoin. If you wanna make money on price rises don't just hodl though; sell before the bubble bursts.

Could I possibly have some coins ��?

I know it's hard to not be so delusional but believe it Or not all the people saying this is a bubble aren't one person on different accounts. God your bias is showing. As far as their being no crash. I donno. 20% drop in a day is a pretty big crash in my books. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 12:31:56
You're a wise man. Most people are just in awe when they hear about my masters in anal and don't think to doubt me. As far as I source of desperation, I just genuinely think that bitcoin will correct lower. How desperate of me to share this view on the bitcoin subreddit. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 12:40:20
Wow. Ok I get how this may be complicated for you. Let me explain. So say someone has this idea that a financial asset will correct lower. They would likely short that asset. They may choose to leverage their short. If they are genuinely fully convinced, they may elect for a high amount of leverage. Likewise, if they expect it to correct lower, this could also encompass he view that said asset is a bubble that will be crashing down soon. I know, all very nuanced. Keep reading through and hopefully it makes sense, let me know if you need any more help. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 05:07:35
They're not mutually exclusive. The tech can be here to stay and price can still crash. Bitcoin won't die but it's price will plummet. 
@_date: 2017-09-10 07:05:09
Sub 4K and heading lower baby. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 09:04:18
Yes it went up too fast

Just not a deluded fanboy really.

Y u mad

That new wealth is already fully grown and Satoshi is a billionaire. Get out before price drops. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 05:06:23
You're an idiot if you don't think bubbles bursting have catalysts like this.
