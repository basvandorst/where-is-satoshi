If John McAfee is correct, that $500 investment will be worth $40,000 in 2 Years.  If he’s wrong, well, you just purchased a ticket to watch him defile himself the low low cost of $500.  
It’s Win/Win!

This is terrible news.  It means that the price is going to drop by at least $750,000 from its 2020 highs of $1 million.  Knowing this though, when should we cash out?  Will it be a hard crash or slow over time?  Will the crash be right after a million, or will it hit 2 before it starts to crash?Should we hodl through it??  Ugh so many questions, so little time.

Perhaps our dev teams over here are over thinking the complexity of this change across a system with millions of users.  Can you do a quick ELI5 how we go about this without expending any effort at all?  Better yet, can you just make the change before Sunday for us if we don’t even have to expend any effort.  We’re going to be cycling our servers on Sunday morning anyways, so if you’re done before then Coinbase will be Segwit compliant for everyone for the start of the new week.  I’m excited.

Its a virtual slam dunk that it will get to $500k in 3 Years.  John McAfee already guaranteed It’s hitting $1M in 2020, his entire manhood depends on it, literally :-)

Yup, are you done yet?

From my understanding of how this works, there’s over 100 MB of backlogged transactions in the mempool to date.  Each transaction has an associated transaction fee with it and miners generally only pull the top 1MB of transactions with the highest fees from the pool as those are the most profitable to mine.  If a transaction has a really low fee, it can take an extremely long time for it to get scooped into a block and processed, because more transactions get added with higher fees on top of it.
