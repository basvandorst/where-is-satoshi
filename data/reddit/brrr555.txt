How soon is the BTC available to transfer once you purchase?
@_date: 2018-01-31 21:27:46
Same here.  Any change yet? I can't find the option.  I also want to know if there are special fees for debit card purchase.

Is there a fee when withdrawing from USD wallet to bank via ACH?
@_date: 2018-01-31 06:01:36
Any extra fees for using debit card?
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:25:30
Does this help?

So if you initiate an ACH transfer into Gemini today, up to $500 is instantly available to use?
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:25:00
Thanks, I really appreciate the information.  Is the BTC immediately available to transfer to an external wallet after purchase?
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:31:53
In regards to fees are you referring to your bank's debit card which you linked to Square, or the Square Cash debit card? Square Cash has their own debit card I guess which you have to choose to activate.  I haven't tried activating it yet.  I have not used Square Cash much and have not used it in conjunction with an ATM.
Also, in another post somebody said you need to activate the Square Cash debit card in order for the "buy BTC" option to show up. It's confusing.

Check your BoA card and let us know if they coded it as a cash advance instead of a purchase.

Is this happening for ACH deposits into the Coinbase USD wallet?
@_date: 2018-01-31 21:26:59
Same here.  Did you figure it out?
@_date: 2018-01-31 21:30:31
Thanks.  I've use Square to send money, and have a debit card linked.  But I guess I never signed up for the Square Cash card.....Are you saying I need to do that first?
@_date: 2018-01-31 06:12:41
Debit card shouldn't have cash advance fees...how can it?
@_date: 2018-01-31 21:49:30
Did you get hit with any added fees on your bank's debit card?
@_date: 2018-01-31 06:37:03
That's terrible.  Either Coinbase or your bank should have warned you that something changed.  People are getting hit with unpleasant surprises I guess, check out this

Just read an article that it's available for most users now, so might be worth keeping an eye on it.

Coinbase also sent an email recently about how the MCC coding of transactions has changed with banks, so credit card purchases are being coded as cash advances by the banks(and thus the bank charges you cash advance fees).  I am wondering if you do instant purchase with your bank's debit card (that's the 1.5% option you are referring to, correct?) if the bank will hit you with extra fees now.  This is not something Coinbase can control, it's the banks choosing to charge extra fees. Hopefully there would be no extra fees with debit card since it's not a cash advance, but there might be some other fee they tack on and that's what I'm worried about. ACH option is best, but it's too damn slow.

So to buy BTC on Square how does it work
1) USD goes from linked bank debit card account ---&gt; BTC
2)  USD goes from linked bank debit card account ---&gt; Square Cash debit card(the black debit card you are referencing) ---&gt; BTC
Also is the BTC immediately available after purchase to transfer to an external wallet?
@_date: 2018-02-03 03:36:50
Thanks for the detailed information, this is great.  If you already have money in your Coinbase USD wallet, are USD transfers to Gdax instant? I've used Coinbase but never set up the Gdax portion.

So i signed up for square cash card and it says it will be mailed soon.  Still no link to buy btc in Square.  Did you have to wait to receive the card in the mail before you could buy btc through square?
@_date: 2018-02-01 00:53:27
What info do they need to verify a person?
@_date: 2018-02-01 00:36:29
I'm referring to transfering the BTC from Square Cash to an external wallet.  When you buy on Coinbase you have to wait a bunch of days before you can transfer the BTC (unless you pay with credit card or debit card, but there are expensive fees for that).  I'm wondering if that waiting period is also something that happens with Square Cash.

Good to hear.  Let's say I wanted to transfer $500 worth of BTC from Square to another exchange.  I'm trying to calculate total fees, including BTC network fees and any Square fees.
