I don't understand, why? because taxes?
@_date: 2018-02-04 00:13:38
and if someone who doesn't have citizenship work for them they get taxed. getting taxed twice must me depressing. at least these  people can renounce it and not pay a lot now since crypto is a secret.  it is a way to keep the gov from controlling people
