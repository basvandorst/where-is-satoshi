No they're not. They're planning to announce their own cryptocurrency, the "republic coin", which will be built on a  groundbreaking and new aadhar blockchain.

they still gotta get their heads around this though.

read : "surprisingly". this statement was not intended to praise or congratulate the government, but to show surprise for their rare display of somewhat agreeable behavior. Coming from an incompetent government like that, this news reads like sweet frosting.

yep. bitcoin is not legal tender in india says the goverment. well even legal tender isn't legal tender in india. incidentally, today, a shopkeeper rejected ten rupee coins as payment for cigarettes, saying they're no valid "around here," so i paid him in curses and blessings. gave him around .3 of that.

Well that's credit. Here the bank is not letting you buy "lottery tickets", if that's the analogy, with your own hard earned money. While they're at it the banks also should decide whether they should allow me to purchase the ice cream maker I've been eyeing for a while. Who knows, maybe it'll try to strangle me at night. You and I both know what's going on here.

This is absolutely plain dumb. This country just trumps itself everyfuckingtime. Good riddance indeed! How ironic that one cant apparently invest in nucleus vision, dent, power ledger etc, all of whom have legit Indian partnerships/affiliations. Have they even thought this through?

And we all know how rarely our banks take risks with public money to protect the people's interests. We read about it everyday. Cryptos don't even come close to the scale of bank frauds and scams. Yet. Yet. They're the old guard and they're now pissing their pants.

I have a question. When I buy crypto P2P from say local bitcoins/localethereum, how does the bank know I'm making a cryptopurchase? Given that they aren't considered illegal yet technically, how and to what extent am I or the trader liable?
