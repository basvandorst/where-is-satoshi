Nice! Competition is heating up in this space. Trucoin offers a fast and easy service for buying btc, I've enjoyed using them without any problems. They have some great strengths over Circle and Coinbase that shouldn't be overlooked. While I like Circle, most credit cards will charge you a cash advance fee for buying btc using Circle's service. Coinbase offers CC support only for making instant purchases, not directly buying with a CC.

I'm skeptical that banks can drop those rates to zero as well. Fama is brilliant, but perhaps he hasn't considered the complexities of banking transaction costs?

What's wrong with those services?
