huge huge huge. 
by now, your grandparents and their pets heard of bitcoin. but the fact that it’s still pretty hard to access, and their bank or whoever is in charge of their finances certainly won’t help them, still makes it a niche „product“. Now imagine if you can buy bitcoin as easy as the coins (or whatever they’re using) in Candy Crush. 2 clicks, and you have it in your wallet. Suddenly, everyone with an iPhone has access to crypto. Thats millions and millions of people who want to get their hands on bitcoin, but so far couldn’t. +it also makes it way more usable as a currency.

fun fact, tsingtao used to be a german beer called germania. germany had a colony in china where they brewed it, it was renamed to tsingtao after the japanese took over but it’s still the same recipe. It’s brewed after the german Reinheitsgebot

I have 5k€ laying around that I don’t really need rn. What would you guys recommend me to do? Buy? Now? Or when?
@_date: 2017-10-14 16:30:04
cool, thank you. my risk tolerance is pretty high (university is free here and my student job pays around 2k€ /month after taxes + i get 900 from my parents). 
it just hurts to see this money laying around, i will have around 10k by the end of the year and i would love to see that money „working“ for me. 
sorry for any grammar mistakes, it’s late and i’m overworked

thank you, will do!!

Is it possible that we somehow transfer our portfolio data from another app? I’m currently using cryptonaut and I would like to use your app but I’m too lazy to manually put in my whole portfolio again

:) i feel like thats the mindset most people have towards bitcoin in general

Why not 5 at once? &amp; where do i start? is there a really good tutorial that you can recommend (from my understanding wallets are not 100% safe)? &amp; how easy is it to sell?

so, would it make sense to dump now and wait until november is over to save me some headaches? i only bought very little amounts so far. 
i was going to spend a couple of grand, but do you think it would make more sense to wait until 2x passed?
+ 2x is probably going to cause a drop, so that would be a good moment to buy anyways right?
