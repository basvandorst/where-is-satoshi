I know this is more for the design team than the security team but...
OK, so if you go to sell BTC for Paypal, the confirmation screen says "for delivery on Friday" (assuming its currently Friday because its a same-day transaction). 
If you go to Buy BTC from ACH, in my accounts case it said that it would be available Friday, when it was a Friday. But in that case it was 7 days. I wouldn't have agreed to a 7 day buy process, I thought the purchase would have been one of the Instant Buys since it was so small. 
PLEASE get this to someone who can help. I'm sure it's angering and confusing other people. Don't just put the day it'll be available. Put the date, or number of days, or "Instant" in the case of instant.

Not really, the state lottery commissions can have a private key they use to combine with the NIST randomness beacon hash. Then hash that combination, convert to base(56) or however high your digits can be for each lottery number you pick. 
Then pick the first 6 or 7 digits, depending on how many numbers are used in the lottery.
A system like this would require that not only the state lottery be compromised, but also the NIST researchers that run the randomness beacon. 
I used a similar method to build an auditable, non-cheatable way to create a cryptocurrency based lottery.

Well, then the lottery can publish a public key while they hold onto the private key. 
The lottery would take the result of the NIST randomness beacon, digitally sign it with their private key and published the signed result. Then a published algorithm to hash the signed result and convert it to lottery numbers would be applied. 
That way every step of the process is auditable and reproducible, except for the actual number generation, which is truly random and can't be reproduced... however the results of the number generation are signed by the NIST, and that holds the weight of their signature.

I'm using my BTC holdings to fund a year off of work and just spending it with my wife and kids in the mountains of Puerto Rico. I've been working on personal projects so far, but I'm about to start working on open-source stuff. 
I'm trying to make a new thin node that just relays transactions and blocks and is centrally controlled. The hope is to make a system that lets me broadcast transactions to the majority of the network in sub-seconds rather than the 10-15 second delay that exists now. 
Merchants and wallets can use the API to submit the PushTX transactions and pay a small fee for the use, and the fee is used to pay the users who run the node. It'll basically be a "Node As A Service."
Satoshi didn't expect node operators to NOT be miners, so incentive wasn't built into that part of the ecosystem. I'm hoping to change that. 
It'll also allow for thin node operators to vote on transaction and block preferences. When consensus is reached, all the nodes will enforce those spam and relay policy decisions.

Why would miners profit more from LN+small blocks more than large blocks? 
If Bitcoin is a settlement layer for LN, there will be fewer transactions with higher transaction fees (but likely less since the fees are now being moved to the LN channels who want their cut). If Bitcoin itself is used for all transactions with larger blocks then there will be more transactions, albeit with smaller fees, but all fees will go to the miners.

Talking to a lawyer is a good idea. It sounds like by offering to do it for equity, you were basically doing "work for hire". I don't know if that's negated by them not paying you. And I don't know if that means that you maintain ownership, or that they just still owe you that equity (plus extra damages for trying to steal it)
I hope it turns out that you have clear ownership so you can release it to the community. It sounds really useful for a lot of projects!

Bitcoin's price isn't 100% pegged to the "feelings" of the community. Bitcoin's price is determined by the demand from financial speculators, people wanting it for the utility value, people buying and selling goods, etc.
And I think Gavin is right. We are having an existential crisis.
Is Bitcoin appropriate for daily transactions or just as a settlement layer for off-chain transactions?
Is Bitcoin supposed to just be for financial transactions or are the other things built on the Blockchain OK?
Should we help transaction fees raise years in advance of the block subsidy going away, or see how the economics play out layer?
Is development controlled by a small group of people "democratic enough" for Bitcoin?
There are lots of really good philosophical questions with really good answers on both sides. I worry that some of these things aren't solvable. It'll be like the abortion debate or gun control or whatever distracting issues politicians like to keep us focused on while they do shit behind the scenes.

Nothing hard coded, I thought. If there is a limit, how did that 1mb transaction get into a block and why is there the anxiety over larger blocks that could include larger transactions?
I think you're confusing the mempool 100k transaction limit policy with a policy that rejects blocks based on transaction sizes in the block.
@_date: 2015-12-31 12:11:53
From what I understand, the problem is that you don't really know if the block will take too long to process until after its already been processed and by then the damage has been done.
I think we have to tread carefully because this eventually could become another debate similar to the block size debate.
How complicated or large can an individual transaction be?
With off-chain solutions like LN wanting to use big transactions to close out channels, we could eventually see some really big transactions in blocks.
With RBF we could see some big transactions in the mempool slowly growing bigger and bigger, each being verified each time they're replaced with another RBF transaction. 
Maybe one day we'll see another controversy with some people saying nodes were never meant to be run on a raspberry pi.
In fact, can RBF be used as an attack by making a large transaction with a small fee and using RBF to keep replacing the transaction so the node keeps verifying the transaction scripts and hashes on every update?
@_date: 2015-12-01 17:15:12
Frankly, I don't care right now if it's BIP101 or Lightning. The problem is that we need to make the change NOW. We're already at capacity. We can't put off BIP101 to wait until a summer launch of Lightning. We can't delay Lightning until more needed changes are casually snuck into Bitcoin Core .
BIP101's implementation in XT at least has the benefit of being complete and very well tested on the testnet. They didn't even test RBF on the testnet!
My customers are all starting to blame me because they're not getting what they have bought quickly enough. I can't do 0-confirmation anymore, and with the backlog, their transactions are often taking 2 or 3 blocks to get included.

I used to be against the Bitcoin Foundation but I'm willing to give them another shot if they have successfully rebooted. The question is if some of the controversial decisions they made in the past are still the kinds of things they would do in the future. I don't think the right thing for the Bitcoin Foundation is to lobby. It's too expensive and ineffective, and very controversial. 
There are tons of controversial changes to the Bitcoin protocol different groups want to go in that aren't compatible with each other. Bitcoin is supposed to be democratic, but we don't have a way to perform ballots to decide those directions. I would love it if the Bitcoin Foundation was the Gallup Poll of the Bitcoin ecosystem. 
Also, as a poor entrepreneur, I can't afford membership. My family and I are living on 3 BTC a month while I code new products and services. Lots of organizations have "student" membership rates. I would like to see a "entrepreneur" rate that is very low for the first year or two. Alternatively, if an entrepreneur pledges to have open books, maybe a membership that equals a percentage of profits would make good sense too. If I could join at 5% of my profits, I would take that in a heartbeat since I don't know if my startup will make 1 BTC or 1000 BTC. 
Lastly, they need a startup wiki. A way to find out what paperwork needs to be done to incorporate, what places are friendly for forming a company, what laws and regulations different Bitcoin businesses might face, a directory of marketing and legal experts, etc. 
@_date: 2015-12-01 21:10:47
I would love both, but one of them seems ready to deploy today and I don't think we should wait for the other one. What's frustrating though is that if Lightning requires anything that'll need a hard fork, it makes sense to bundle them together so avoid that pain later down the line.

Some examples:
[0.038 payment to 1F1pQnNYpFXqYhXsJZYWjwiWUW7AEVyFeo](
BlockChain.info API gave me the deposit address of 1F1pQnNYpFXqYhXsJZYWjwiWUW7AEVyFeo that forwards to my destination address of 19j4FchgymsbQDmFdx4VdC4vjzfX5fCh4K. Payment was received and confirmed. They added an additional 0.0001 from 1Bz2Bz2jWG73NL8AuYdvcxj5fkFJDHGpo2 to pay for the transaction fee for transfer to the destination address, but that additional 0.0001 is from an unconfirmed payment. You can trace this back to unconfirmed transactions originating from [this wallet which has transactions unconfirmed from the 28th of Feb](
[0.038 payment to 1PKu8o19ppZrXzqV1kEMiRgZciWc1UVVgw](
BlockChain.info API gave me the deposit address of 1PKu8o19ppZrXzqV1kEMiRgZciWc1UVVgw that forwards to my destination address of 19j4FchgymsbQDmFdx4VdC4vjzfX5fCh4K. Payment was received and confirmed. They added an additional 0.0001 from 153VrTehK5gBuQHr17hEYxt58qfbwDdGHU to pay for the transaction fee for transfer to the destination address, but that additional 0.0001 is from an unconfirmed payment. 
You can trace this back to unconfirmed transactions originating from [this wallet which has transactions unconfirmed from the 28th of Feb](
I'm pretty sure that BlockChain.info just has a problem with one of their nodes and it isn't broadcasting transactions to the network properly, but since it's their node they're trusting it enough to continue piling on unconfirmed transactions on each other. 
They either need to fix the node or add in some logic to prevent building a house of cards of transactions that could result in a lot of people's money being in the wrong places. 
Another possibility is to allow the API users to allow BlockChain.info to deduct the 0.0001 transaction fee from our own transaction. I appreciate your generosity, but I don't mind paying my own fees especially when it increases reliability.

So, you want to sell bitcoins on your website and accept credit cards as payment?
That's very high-risk. Any payment processor would shut you down the moment you start doing that because of the high fraud rates. It's too easy for someone to use a stolen credit card to buy bitcoins. 
Also, if you are a US citizen or are in the US, you need to have a money transmitters license for every state that you'll possibly have customers in (that's all of them that require a money transmitters license... 35+ of them, if I remember correctly). That'll cost you about a million bucks. I think there are companies now to help guide you through the process, so it might be down to 750k. 
You also need to file with the US govt as a FSB. 
Then, you also need to have anti-money-laundering procedures and checks in place. Failure to report transactions over 10k or suspicious transactions WILL result in jail time or millions of dollars in fines. 
You also need to perform proper Know Your Customer checks. This requires you to ask your customers for their drivers license, copy of a bill, and verify their phone number and email address (if I remember correctly). If you don't do that, you will go to jail or have lots of crazy fines. 
If any of your customers are on any of the various terrorist watch lists or sanctioned actors list or sanctioned countries list and you miss it because you didn't do KYC checks, you will go to a jail that sucks twice as much. 
I know, the US sucks.

Well, it's that I lose BTC. I'm a bitcoin purist and do all of my accounting with BTC as the base, not USD. 
So if I spend 1 BTC to buy goods worth $850 and then the BTC exchange rate goes to $1000 a BTC, when I sell those $850 of goods, I'll only get back 0.85 BTC and I've lost 0.15 BTC in the transaction.

Exactly! If I was able to secure an agreement that I could live with that would allow for instant order fulfillment (no more inventory) then I wouldn't have this issue at all. I could buy the codes for (about) 95c on the dollar, sell for face value, convert 95% of that to USD to pay the supplier at the end of the week or month and keep my profits in BTC. 
Sadly, their large startup fee and request to not sell internationally makes it a decision that I cannot make.

Looking back, I've had 3 transactions that I lost money on due to various issues because I choose to accept payments on 1 confirmation. The transactions were lost due to receiving one confirmation, but that payment ended up being on a orphaned block and for some reason, the orphaned transactions weren't wrapped up into another block for over 48 hours and were eventually purged from mempools and the transactions were returned to the seller.

It sounds like you should team up with a few other similar parties and create an open source exchange abstraction layer. Then you and those sites could code to a standard, and simply add modules to enable new exchanges. 
Kind of like how lots of modern MVC frameworks have a Database Abstraction Layer. 
EDIT: I could use something like this and can kick a little bit of funding to it, if you can take the helm and find developers. It would speed up the development of a lot of future sites and if it became popular enough, any new exchange starting up would simply write their own module to be compatible.

More and more startup projects are turning to selling  Blockchain-based tokens to raise capital for operations. Many believe that they have found a loophole around Securities regulations by requiring the token itself to interact with the project itself. The thought is that you're not selling a share, but a license key for the future product that is being built. 
Do you know of any official views on the legitimacy of this "loophole" in Washington? Should we expect some SEC indictments on these token-funded projects or perhaps against new alt-coins created purely as the currency speculation equivalent to penny stocks? Perhaps some attention on market manipulation in the crypto currency space?

By nature, I'm somewhat close to communist (Star Trek utopian model) but I recognize that it's impossible because greed causes people with political power to take resources and not supply them to the populace.

As for the xbox prices... I think I found a distributor that will sell me Xbox Live memberships for WAY under the listed price, so I'll be able to drop my prices substantially. As for the XBox gift cards, I don't think I'll ever be able to sell them for less than face value. 
In fact, my goal is to be selling everything for face value in the next few weeks as long as I can source it in BTC (it's hard to convince distributors to accept it!) 
All the stuff that requires me to pony up my debit card, like Spotify and Crunchyroll and stuff like that, will always be the face value + a processing fee that I discussed before. 
I averages about 5% profit on things I can source in BTC. For things I have to purchase with USD, I usually charge a flat $5 fee. I have to do this to help cover the BTC/USD exchange rate fluctiation that occurs from when a customer pays for an item and I have to cash out to USD to purchase more of that item for inventory (that process sometimes takes 4 or 5 days). 
My new software I wrote for the site will allow me to track every price point (USD and BTC) during the sourcing and sales process, so after a few weeks, I'll do some analysis and number crunching to see how much I can drop the USD sourced inventory while still not being too exposed to BTC price fluctuations. 
My goal is to build enough of a buffer that I can price the USD sourced items in a way that I am not making a profit, and just use the sales figures and data to approach those vendors to encourage them to accept BTC directly or to let me purchase on net-30 credit with a 5% discount off of face value, so I can sell at face value.

I'm don't really care about the Fiat to BTC side. I can understand a 3 or 4 day delay. 
It's the BTC to Fiat side that doesn't make sense. Coinbase should be able to upload their transactions to their ACH processor before 7pm and the USD be in the accounts of their customers by the next morning. 
Edit: For reference, I made a sell order at Coinbase on a Friday and it didn't hit my account until the next Friday. I called my bank and talked to the ACH department who informed that the first their system saw it was Thursday night during regular processing. This means that the entire delay was on Coinbase's side.

The agents never pretended to be selling stolen property or stolen "money". They were telling the BTC vendor that their money was the result of an illegal enterprise. The vendor should have ended the transaction at that point. By proceeding, he was knowingly facilitating money laundering by taking "dirty money" from a criminal enterprise and turning it into an asset that was clean for the criminal. 
Trust me, the DA will throw every possible charge at a person and let the court figure out which ones will stick. If they didn't throw conversion of stolen property, then there is no way for that charge to be added in this case.

This is a great find, thank you! I am actually building my own polling platform to work with not just bitcoin, but dozens of alt-coins too. 
I like redundancy for any infrastructure project. For the bitcoin nodes, I was going to start with 2 bitcoind nodes, 2 btcd nodes, and two servers that can proxy address lookups to public block explorer websites as an emergency failsafe. 
Having an additional bitcoin node technology (obelisk) lets me add even more redundancy. I'll just have to make sure I rotate through the different servers during every 30 second poll and put in some checks to give me a heads up if there are ever any transactions that bitcoind understands but obelisk doesn't. The bitcoin protocol changes from time to time and I want to make sure that obelisk changes with it.

A lot of tech blogs get free stuff all the time. If the manufacturer doesn't want whatever-it-was it back, they usually hold some kind of raffle among their readership and give it away. 
That would be acceptable to me just as much as them sending miners back to the manufacturer. 
What if they wanted to do a story on the long-term lifespan of a miner? That might be acceptable too if they wrote a story about the miner, mentioned that they were going to keep it for extended testing, and just donated the BTC to a charity.

Hi everyone,
I've been running PremiumGiftCards for about 10 months now (it was previously SteamLoader.com). I was unhappy with the previous code so I rewrote it to add some great features.
Now, you can order multiple items and if any of them are not in stock, it'll send your partial order by emai and then the remainder of the order once we have the rest in stock.
We carry a lot of gaming and media stuff (Steam, XBox, Playstation, Hulu, Spotify, Origin/EA) and in a few weeks we'll be adding Google Playstore, Amazon Prime memberships, Lastpass, Backblaze, Crunchyroll, DeviantArt, Lastpass, and Rdio. Basically, if the service sells gift cards but doesn't take BTC, we'll be your intermediary. Just let me know what else you think I should carry.
I'm a Bitcoin purist and I keep all profits in BTC. If you search for SteamLoader, you should find plenty of reviews that show that I'm a pretty honorable guy, take customer service seriously, and do a pretty good job making sure your purchases are in your hands very quickly.
At the moment, cards are delivered after 3 confirmations, but I'm working on some improvements to detect double spend attacks and expect to bring it down to 1 confirmation soon. Another improvement I'm making soon is if a payment is received after the payment window, it won't reject it outright. It'll check to see if the payment amount is still a reasonable price for the product and let you continue your order or let you enter an address for a refund. Lastly, I'm writing in the function so if someone overpays for an order, they can choose to either let me accept it as a kind of tip, add it to a pool of money that I'll routinely donate to Sean's Outpost, apply it to a future order, or ask for me to send it back.
Please feel free to try the new codebase out. If you're a hacker, feel free to try to mess around with the system and let me know if you find any problems. I'm not super wealthy, but I'll pay reasonable bounties for anything you find.

Last fall, Kerples said that he was going to split up the private keys into pieces using a Shamir's Secret Sharing algorithm so it would take multiple pieces to reconstitute the private key. 
My assumption is they either made a mistake with that algorithm, or enough of the pieces are unavailable to them (seized safety deposit box, lost, corrupted media, etc). 
When they were done splitting up the keys for security and safety, they probably deleted the original keys. 
This private key they discovered is probably one they forgot to delete in some ancient forgotten backup.

@_date: 2014-07-23 23:38:07
I agree. A bitcoin exchange, wallet, or 'bank' doesn't need government regulation to protect it from making risky business decisions like operating an unstable fractional reserve. They now have the technology to be community regulated when they agree to certain transparency technologies like proof-of-solvency and verifiable &amp; transparent financial accounting. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 11:22:29
It does add up if the government seized his safety deposit boxes, but those only held a portion of the private keys. Mark has said that he split up the private keys into portions and stored them in separate locations. He could simply not have access to some of those locations anymore.

I buy gift cards from legit distributors using BTC and they all  use Coinbase, so it's convenient for me to keep a balance there for quickly refilling inventory. 
Anytime an order starts, I give customers a deposit address I get from the blockchain.info API. That address forwards deposits to my coinbase account and hits a webhook at my site to inform my software of the deposit. Then I take my daily profit and transfer it to cold storage. I never have more than 5 BTC in the coinbase account. 
The blockchain webhook callback system isn't 100% reliable, so I'm also doing validation of address balances using the chain.com API. 
@_date: 2014-04-26 16:09:57
When a bank reports a "suspicious" transaction to the government, they're legally required to NOT tell the customer that the report has taken place. Chase might have a software solution that looks at multiple variables and reports suspicious transactions automatically. 
They might also have a policy that accounts that have flagged suspicious transactions should be automatically closed. 
Algorithms go wild sometimes. It's probably not your coinbase transaction by itself. Maybe it was daily traffic under $100 and then the big $2000 transaction. Maybe it was receiving money from paypal and then sending money to Coinbase. Maybe it was that you bought a burrito a week ago and then bought BTC. Who knows. They probably don't even know. 
A lot of these neural network fraud-detection algorithms become closed black boxes and they just obey the output.

I just got Angel funding to make a competitor to miicard (tenatively at blockauth.com at the moment), but it'll be a few months until we're fully ramped up. Instead of just verifying bank account details, we'll verify anything and everything the user can throw at us from address to passport to college graduation information. Then we encrypt the data with a public key and archive it. When a person logs into a site, we're able to pass along our assurances that those things were verified, but not the actual data itself. It's a way for sites to meet the Know Your Customer validation without having to ask for documentation themselves. Too many sites don't know how to do security properly.

It'll eventually clear, but it'll take up to 8 hours... What's frustrating is their callback system doesn't notify on the deposit, it notified when the funds are forwarded from the deposit address to your wallet address.

Mark said in late 2013 that their current private keys were split up into multiple pieces and stored each piece in separate locations, but they were planning on moving to a "shamir's secret sharing" algorithm "soon". 
It's quit possible that they simply generated a new address and moved the coins. Maybe something went wrong with that process? Or enough of the pieces of the Shamir's secret aren't available to Mark anymore? (seized safety deposit boxes, lost, employee quit, USB drive formatted, who knows)

cpzhao, I'm quite familiar with how the blockchain protocol works. If you read the post in detail, you'll see that I'm using a service that blockchain.info provides. 
They tell me a deposit address that they generate and have the private keys for. I instruct my customers to make a deposit to that address. When blockchain.info sees the money deposited into that address, they add on a miners fee and sweep the funds to my personal deposit address. 
It's the miners fee that they added that was unconfirmed and likely won't confirm because it's from a malformed transaction on an orphaned block. Since it's bundled with the payment that's supposed to be forwarded to me, I fear that I'll never receive the funds.

I might need some help with jQuery soon. I've been reengineering the site for a few weeks now and it keeps on getting more and more complicated (but better). 
Right now I'm wrangling splitting up the site into 4 different logical components (deposit address monitoring, deposit address sweeping, digital order fulfillment, and the code site) all wrangled together using RabbitMQ to enable proper messaging between the components and to allow me to build in redundancy later. 
The reason for doing this is that I'm going to spin off the deposit monitoring to a separate service at addressmonitor.com as well as possibly splitting off the deposit address sweeping service. The digital order fulfillment system will also be a separate service eventually too.

[A few]( [reddit threads](
Just a heads up though, right now it's based on the blockchain.info API and it's been sucking lately. I used to have problems with about 5% of orders needing me to manually intervene to trigger delivery of the code. Since last week when the blockchain.info service started screwing up, it's been more like 20% of orders. 
I'm pretty good with customer service but if someone orders just as I go to sleep, it could be a few hours until its delivered. Normally it's automatic within 10 minutes, but lately it's been averaging about a 40 minute delivery time. 
I'm moving to another payment processor ASAP and doing a full redesign. I'm tired of apologizing to customers because of something out of my control.

The best guess is that their backend server that hosts their wallet isn't working and the site simply showed a 0 balance because of that. That wasn't very professional, IMHO. It should have simply shown "Balance unavailable due to maintenance" if the backend server is down. 
When they woke up to work on things, I guess they just decided to bring down the whole frontend too until it's figured out.

Coinbase is the new PayPal in terms of market ownership and being blacklisted with no recourse means that I'll be struggling for decades.

He's stated before that the private keys were split apart and stored in multiple locations for security. I think it's more likely that the US government ordered one of his banks to seize his accounts last year during the silk road investigations and that resulted in his safety deposit box contents being seized, or the bank is under court order to prevent access to the contents. 
I don't think the government has access to the full private key or some Justice Dept lackey wanting a promotion would have officially seized the coins and transfered them to a new address. If they have a piece of the key and isn't letting Mark have it, then those coins are just stuck until some kind of agreement is reached.

I build websites and businesses. Formerly, I ran a site that sold gift cards for Bitcoin. My most popular gift card was a $5 Steam Wallet Code card. If I sold that today, the transaction fees would turn away customers. At 2.5% profit, I wouldn't able to afford to swallow the transaction fees. 
I just fondly remember the days when discounts were offered to BTC paying customers because the transaction fees were practically non-existent. Now businesses are dropping Bitcoin because the transaction fees are higher than credit card processing. 
I'm trying to figure out how to continue to run businesses that focus on selling goods or services to a Bitcoin audience.

It's one of those "we don't know what the future holds" issues. Maybe LN will take off and be amazing, and all those LN settlement channels will settle hundreds or thousands of transactions at once and can use a larger transaction to do it. 
Charging a higher fee for a larger transaction is great in principal, but there shouldn't be any kind of acceptable fee to generate a transaction so large it would cause verification problems.
I think a good compromise is to give a limit for each transaction type. Then if there is a reason to create large transactions in the future (LN or something else), they can have their own transaction type identifier that'll have a different limit.

I am excited for future second-layer solutions, but I build businesses that need to accept digital currency without censorship and for small transactions. LN *will* solve this problem, but it's not operational yet. 
As a business builder that used to just accept Bitcoin directly until it became too expensive to use for small transactions, what are my choices? What are the choices suggested by the Devs?
I know the high transaction fees have been seen coming for years which is why LN was being created, but surely there is some kind of stop-gap measure available.

It would be interesting to contemplate a dynamic block reward. The more full the block, the greater the reward. 
Problem is that this falls apart if there isn't a backlog of transactions. Why should they be punished if there are only enough transactions to fill 1/10th of a block?
It would also make calculations of how many BTC come into creation every day a different amount, and that could have economic consequences. 
Perhaps this is an opportunity to start rewarding nodes for the service they provide (a glaring mistake, in my opinion). 
Perhaps the first node to see a transaction could digitally sign the transaction with a node donation address before propagating it. If the block is at least 50% full, the fees and block reward would go to the miner. 
If the block is less than 50% full, the miner would have to add in transactions to send all the fees to the nodes referenced in the transaction signatures. If they didn't, the block would be rejected by the network. 
Just a half-baked idea.

That would be too late in my opinion. 
I used to process my customers with 0-confirmation transactions, but RBF has scared me off. 
My customers are using very reasonable fees, but the time required for first confirmation is ridiculously high. I had 9 transactions that took over 6 hours to confirm today. Over 30 transactions took more than an hour to get into their first block. 
Bitcoin used to take an average of 10 minutes. This is becoming unusable for my business. 
Edit for more context: 
312 transactions today. Minimum transaction size was 0.05 BTC (more than 'spam', IMHO). 
When I did 0-confirmation transactions, I had no successful double-spend attacks across over 4000 BTC worth of commerce. I simply waited 1 minute and ran the transaction info I could determine through a neural network. If there were any perceived risks, I would deffer transmission of their purchase until the transaction was in a block. This occurred less than 8% of the time. 
I sell gift cards, so a double spend would have cost significant profits. 
1 minute delivery has changed to an average (today) of 18 minutes.

I've set up Payment Channels for a new penny auction site I'm building and that'll likely work, but I'm also a developer for a digital goods ecommerce site (ebooks, and the like) where most purchases are one-off situations. Some purchases are dozens or hundreds of dollars, but most are about a dollar or two. 
Considering that it's a "Bitcoin Marketplace", asking users to send me money via Western Union is a bit insulting to them and to the community. 
And the fees might be $0.20 at the moment (haven't looked), they sometimes jump up over a dollar. 
And it's not that I expect core devs to care about my specific business, it's that there used to be such a large push years ago trying to get businesses to accept Bitcoin to help the ecosystem develop. There was a lot of people who felt that Bitcoin won't 'make it' until there are Bitcoin-only businesses. 
When Core decided to pivot to a "settlement layer" approach where regular transactions take place on secondary layers, they should have advised the regular users and business users on what to do since they're apparently not the focus anymore. 
I'm glad Core has been working hard on SegWit, but they've seemingly abandoned or discouraged existing business uses from using Bitcoin without suggesting an alternative until Lightning Networks (where they want all business transactions to take place) are ready and functional. 
It's been years and it'll likely be years more until we have a healthy functional LN ecosystem. Businesses are fleeing Bitcoin as a payment solution and I'm shocked that the Core developers haven't issued an official recommendation on what to do until LN is operational. At this point, we're not just losing all Bitcoin acceptance momentum, it's moving backwards.

I get that, but it's not functional today. There is still no timeline on when to expect the core decentralized routing algorithm features, AFAIK. 
Businesses who want to sell products for under $20 need a solution TODAY. Some businesses are starting to stop accepting Bitcoin because of the occasional high fees or fee uncertainties. 
Should they move to an Alt? If so, the consumers will transition too and I worry that they might not transition back, regardless of how amazing the LN technology will end up being one day.

Well, my last business that I mentioned earlier... selling gift cards for other services. 
I was just a reseller. I would buy codes sourced from physical cards purchased from wholesalers. Once I released the code to the buyer, they would use it and I had no ability to invalidate it in any way. 
Current projects? CoinMall often sells digital goods from sellers for bitcoin. Once the buyer downloads the ebook, I can't pull it back. 
Selling digital goods for a few bucks ($2 or $3, maybe?) makes them easy to sell because spending a few bucks doesn't take much thought. When you complicate things by telling them that block delays could mean they don't get their product for a few hours, it really cuts down on impulse buys. People with digital money want instant gratification. 
The other project I'm building, satoshiauction, is a penny auction site (bidding fee auction). People spend btc to make bids but end up buying the item for very little money. So, a 0.5 BTC item might end up being sold for 0.0005 BTC but everyone who bid on it spent 0.00025 for each bid. In general, you try to get all the variables to align so most of the time the amount spent in bids pays for the item itself. I can sell bid tickets in bulk for that site, but if someone is in the middle of a battle to win an auction and runs out of tickets, they could run out of time before their ticket pack purchase confirms. I'm looking into using payment channels instead. 
Regardless, there are legitimate business use cases for low-value transactions with low fees in a somewhat reasonable amount of time.

RBF can be worked around, but it's been clear that the direction of Bitcoin development is currently focused on features that are cannibalistic when it comes to features (spun as weaknesses) that were useful for the "edge case" of 0-confirmation transaction processing. 
RBF is just one example. Another is the change to prevent services from connecting to mempools to monitor transaction propagation throughout the relay network. The discussion prior to that change aludes to Core wanting to stop BlockCypher from being able to have that information. I'm still unsure if it's just BlockStream trying to just stop a competitor, or to stop 0-confirmation transaction processing entirely in order to require people use non-Bitcoin transaction systems (such as their Lightning Network offering) if they want transactions to process in a reasonable length of time. 
Regardless of the true intent, it is obvious that simply suggesting that people don't use 0-confirmation transactions since they weren't safe enough wasn't enough of a deterrent. A more heavy-handed approach was necessary to create a vacuum where 0-confirmation used to exist so an alternative solution, and group of expensive experts to implement it, would be required.

Not trying to troll, and I'm sorry if it came across that way. 
I was using "coffee transactions" as a term to cover sub $5 transactions. At peak network usage, the transaction fees for those can be over a dollar. 
Any payment system that charges more than 5% of a transaction fee isn't competing very well, so during those network congestion moments, Bitcoin isn't very appealing for transactions less than $20. 
And, yes, I do realize that transaction fees are related to transaction size not the amount being transferred. I'm talking about the psychological impact of paying more than a 5% fee. 
So, for people who have a real need to make a smaller transaction (say, 10 cents or a dollar or $5 dollars), but still want to maintain privacy or support decentralization, what are the recommended options?

Language specificity is important, and by capitalizing certain words to stress them, you seem to indicate that you think so as well. Unfortunately, if you're trying to be precise, you're incorrect. 
SegWit is EFFECTIVELY a blocksize increase, not TECHNICALLY a blocksize increase. The blocks are still 1Mb, it's just that the SegWit compatible signatures have been moved into an attached data structure associated with the block. Clients that do not understand SegWit transactions will not see or process the attached data structure or the SegWit signatures contained therein, and thus will see the SegWit transactions in the 1Mb block as being unsigned. 
In your example, I would try stating: "SegWit is effectively a blocksize increase". Stating that it's a literal (or "actual") blocksize increase creates a point for big blocker trolls to focus on, avoiding the big picture discussion.

What you're describing is p2p payment channels. They've been around for years but they're rarely used. Lightning is using that channel tech but with routing so an open channel with a peer with lots of connections might be able to send a payment onto your destination so you don't have to open another channel yourself.
What I'm curious about is if payment channels, available for years, are rarely used... Will adding routing make them more popular?
Anyway, people keep calling payment channels "lightning" to say that its ready. If you ask for the eta of the actual lightning tech, the routing, you hear crickets.

Problem with the BlockStream method is that they didn't just commit to non-aggression, they put their patents up using the Defensive Patent License v1.1. It's basically like the GPL - Once a company uses the patents, they're required to also put their own patents up using the same license. If they don't, they need to come to a different agreement with BlockStream. 
So, if you're a company that has 100 valuable patents and you want to use Sidechains, you need to give away access to your patents under the same terms or negotiate a private deal with BlockStream.

I'm just tired of this debate which should be on its technical merits being turned into a political debate by both sides. 
Too often, I see people pulling out the old writings of Satoshi like he's some figure in the bible and everyone has differing interpretations of his work. 
If we wish to come to a community consensus on technical merits, falling to those religious style tropes is a step in the wrong direction. 
It seems to me that what Satoshi was saying in that moment was "Don't make that change in your code because the rest of the network has a different variable set and it'll cause the blocks you generate to be rejected because they'll fail consensus. "
He, in my opinion, wasn't trying to make a grand statement on the legitimacy of the concept. If he was, his response would likely have been more verbose. 
The blocksize debate has turned into a hot potato issue like abortion or gay marriage or the countless other social issues that divide American social groups. Those kinds of issues are never able to be settled by debate. 
Instead of trying to fix this issue, we should be figuring out how this seemingly minor technical issue that could have been resolved years ago has turned into such a vitriolic community splitting issue.  If we can identify what went wrong, maybe we can prevent it from happening again, as it seems to have happened with SegWit, Lightning, and RBF. 
Something is broken in the Bitcoin community and until its healed, everything will be contentious and all movement will be stalled or painful and the end result is that we'll drive away all the users and businesses who don't want to be extremists on either side.

Excellent point. 
I actually have an idea on how to compete anyway. I get cards for 5% off face value. I can sell them for the same price, but give 1 confirmation processing (or 0 if I integrate Coinbase). That way it'll be the same cost, but people can get their BTC into Steam more quickly (albeit with a few more hoops)
I can also set aside 1% of each transaction and give it away to a random customer every week as a bonus.
Some gift card companies give 2% or 3% "cash back" reward points, but that seems boring to me. I would rather turn user purchases into a weekly sweepstakes so one user might get a free $100 card or the equivalent in BTC

Why not just ask BlockCypher if there is a more friendly way to provide the data they want, maybe sanitized for privacy improvements, without them resorting to the hacky method?

Most people carry less than $50 in their wallet. Even using LN, people are going to opening channels around that amount and having to pay a buck or two to do so. It's like ATM fees. 
Organically, the idea was that fees would rise to make up for missing block rewards around 2040. Instead Core seems obsessed with driving fees through the roof now so people have to use off-chain solutions that'll be able to charge their own fees. 
It's no wonder Bitcoin has dropped to 66% of the Crypto market cap. Unless this changes, Bitcoin won't be seen as the internet of money, it'll be seen as the MySpace of money.

Can't the same be said for the need to decentralize development? A centralized development group leads to revolt among users that disagree with "managements" handling of situations and makes the development group subject to government manipulation. 
I mean, BlockStream's biggest investor is the 4th richest man in Asia and was director of the China International Trust and Investment Corporation. It serves as the chief investment arm of China's central government and holds ministry status on the Chinese State Council.
Everyone keeps talking about how centralized mining in China is an "obvious" sign of Chinese state manipulation of the Bitcoin industry but there are clear direct ties to Chinese state ownership of Blockstream!
Multiple dev teams will make Bitcoin strong again. We need to quit using Core as a "reference client" and come up with a reference spec. Then that spec change management process needs to be put in the hands of an organization like the IETF.

The problem is that different stake holders feel that the other stake holders don't matter as much as them. Pro-2nd layer people feel that "informed users" are what matters. Miners feel that their stake is most important. Businesses with significantly high BTC usage feel that their stake is most important to the economy. 
There has never been agreement on who is supposed to hold what power, so arguments about "this group has too much power" are unending. 
This really is a political problem not a technology problem... Many of the current power holders don't want to give up any power they have and they want more. It's going to take an excellent statesman with amazing negotiating skills to solve this problem or Bitcoin will keep tearing itself apart... The pre-sigwit fork was just the first rip, and Segwit2x is the next rip. There will likely be more and this needs to stop or there won't be much left behind. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 23:33:54
Because it's cheaper and easier to embrace altcoins when your software was written for pre-segwit Bitcoin than it is to entirely refactor your code to handle batched segwit transactions. 
And if an organization is going to rewrite their ecommerce codebase, they're not going to do it before the SegWit2X movement stuff is settled. The last thing a business wants to do is invest 5-or-6 digits of dev costs on upgrades that might not be worth it in a few weeks. 
That's why so many are moving to the pre-segwit fork (easier to implement) or alts like Ethereum (costs money to implement, but has a healthier community and dev ecosystem not in the midst of a civil war)

I try not to spam too much, but just a heads up that I run premiumgiftcards.com (formerly steamloader.com) that sells Steam wallet codes for BTC. I've been in business for almost 2 years now and have proven that there is a market for Steam funding through Bitcoin. I sell, on average, 100 BTC a month worth of inventory. 
Through my discussions with Valve and their distributors, I've come to believe that they will not accept Bitcoin anytime soon. They don't even like their wallet codes being sold digitally for any currency because it's giving them problems with international sales. They try their best to keep the system in place where they control the pricing for games depending on the purchasing power of citizens in that country. 
Their current system with credit cards let's them identify which country the source of the funds came from and makes them able to match the country with the game store localization. 
What drives them nuts is people in Asia or Eastern Europe buying games for 10% of the price we pay for them in the West and then gifting the game to someone for face value and pocketing the difference.
They want to be able to sell for low prices in those territories to compete with piracy, but feel like they left money on the table when someone takes advantage of the price difference to do some arbitrage. 
Bitcoin (and wallet codes) takes away another data point they use to try to fight that.
Another reason is that their in-house economist, who is now the acting finance minister for Greece, has a Marxist view of economics and is rabidly against Bitcoin and has spent years talking shit about it to anyone and everyone at Valve who would listen.

It's a payment platform that lets people perform microwork to pay for goods and services. They're actually earning BTC, but they just won't realize it since Bitcoin seems confusing to people.

One of the benefits of the old system was that people attempting to double spend only had a *chance* that it would work. That chance was greatly reduced by companies that monitor the network to detect double-spend attempts and other indicators to create a confidence factor. 
Now it's easy for a sender to just issue another transaction and mark it as the correct one, making it impossible to trust 0-confirmation transactions.
I sell Gift Cards for Bitcoin. I sold almost $600k USD worth with 0-confirmation transactions before I disabled 0-confirmation earlier this year for an unrelated reason. 
How much money did I lose to double spends? $0. People tried, trust me, they tried. I simply waited until I saw the transaction, got the raw transaction and pushed it to a dozen broadcast API endpoints as well as relayed it directly to the big mining pools. This ensured that the transaction was propagated quickly, even if their client didn't do it properly. 
Then I waited 2 minutes to make sure there were no other transactions detected that were attempting to do a double spend. 
It worked well. Now it won't because a person can push a transaction, wait 9 minutes, and then override it. 
Here is a question. Bitcoin relies on "Trust but verify". We've seen people maliciously push malformed transactions to create spam to "experiment" or "make a point"
What's preventing a miner from listening for Full-RBF transactions and then purposefully mining the first transaction so the overridden transaction doesn't get written into the block? If the miner succeeds it would make Full-RBF entirely unpredictable and unreliable. 
@_date: 2015-11-28 17:29:05
I do assume that wallets will enable RBF by default, because it'll enable them to offer an "undo" feature for all transactions.

That's possible, but I think you underestimate some of the short-term chaos and the long-term repercussions of that scenario. 
Many people use thin wallets like Mycelium and Electrum. If some of the people running the servers those wallets use switch to BIP148-UASF backends then those users won't know what chain their transaction occurs on. A lot of Bitcoin, on both chains, will be lost to the other chain without the users consent or knowledge. 
If the BIP148 chain becomes a minority or dead chain, the businesses that used BIP148 without making it clear to users will face a lot of wrath from angry customers. If an exchange doesn't track both chains and a customer buys some "Bitcoin" with USD or Ethereum that ends up being an invalid or minority chain, people will demand their money back or threaten fraud lawsuits.

If the most popular wallets enable RBF and set it as the default, it removes the possibility of the merchant being able to choose to accept 0-confirmation transactions. You may think that 0-confirmation transactions are a mistake or too risky, but you shouldn't have the right to choose that for everyone else. 
I am a merchant. I want to give my users 0-confirmation transactions because the current system was very hard to trick. Double-spending is easy to detect and hard for the spender to pull off on a technical level. It also rarely worked do to the random nature of which miner will pick which transaction to confirm.
RBF breaks that by allowing every user to perform a double spend. I will not retract my statement. This is a bad bad thing
@_date: 2017-05-23 16:11:20
Core, under BlockStream's leadership, removed the previous transaction priority algorithm (which included things like coin age) and replaced it with one that just took fees into account. They also pushed for the fee market, enabled RBF to make the fee market more dynamic, and added default minimum fees for transactions to be forwarded or mined in blocks. 
The high fees were encouraged by BlockStream and grew because of a lack of network scaling (which can arguably be blamed on different parties/groups)
I'm sure the miners (not just the Chinese ones but also the Georgian ones and Canadian ones and independent ones) are enjoying the high fees, but they didn't make the situation happen.
@_date: 2015-11-30 13:02:52
Since this isn't anything enforced by the blockchain, if you think it's truly aweful, a node could just refuse to forward RBF transactions to other nodes.
A miner or a pool of miners that disagree with RBF could just mine the original transactions and prune out the replacement transactions.
This would enable rebels to prevent RBF from being ever being reliable enough to be used and not violate any enforced rules. 
@_date: 2015-11-16 16:05:30
So, if the transaction to spend the coin isn't valid until a certain (is it time or block height?), does that mean that the transaction sits in the mempool until it activates?

Oh, and check out those references. The 3/28 article is the Counterparty guy saying that Ethereum won't be successful because nobody needs or wants smart contracts. The 5/11 article is the Counterparty guy saying that they've finished copying over the EVM to counterparty and are going to turn it on soon and now much-needed and desired smart contracts are available. 
That's a huge shift in about 6 weeks. I kind of want a platform I develop and build apps on to be a bit less manic-depressive :-)

Liquid is a house of cards for BlockStream. It's opensource, but protected by their patents on SideChains and Confidential Transactions... but their SideChain patent is invalid for several reasons.
All the concepts in the SideChain patent claims were published by people more than a year before the provisional patent was filed and the concepts in the whitepaper that the patent was based on were placed in the public domain in the whitepaper itself. The USPTO has been informed and their patent will be denied for those reasons.
I'm still researching proof of prior art on the Confidential Transactions patent, but international patent examiner (because they filed for a world-wide patent) already found a lot of prior art flaws and invalidated most of their claims. 
At the moment those customers think that they can't use the patented technology, despite the Defensive Patent License, because it requires those customers to also give away their patents under the DPL. If they're not willing to give away their patents, then they have to license them.... and since Liquid is permissioned, those customers that don't want to pay the licensing fees can just be excluded from Liquid.
BlockStream has nothing of value other than the Liquid Service, and with the exact mechanisms unpatentable, all their customers can just implement the technology themselves if they wanted once the patents are invalidated. At the very least, if the patents are invalidated, it'll give their customers a lot of bargaining power when it comes time to renegotiate any contracts.

I am selling gift cards for other services. Once the email goes out, they can use the card and I can't easily have it canceled without hours of phone calls. I do wait for one confirmation now, but that's because I got tired of manually adjusting variables to improve the system and am moving to a neural-network trained model to detect suspicious transactions. It's going to be part of a payment processor I'm writing and planning to launch by the end of the year.
It is true, I can just look at the raw transaction to see if it's from a client that's requesting the right to perform RBF transactions. If it is, and the address isn't derived from a service that's provided me a BIP44 xpub key for greenlisting, then I'll have to require at least one confirmation. 
I hope RBF doesn't get written into many wallets. My neural network model is able to accept transactions within 20 seconds with 100% accuracy in testing. Within 1.3 seconds with 99.997% accuracy. RBF will make it so it's pointless to run those tests on an RBF enabled transaction. 
EDIT: Oh, and the reason I don't want to wait for 1 confirmation is that I want my customers to have a better experience than Paypal or a CC would give them. Besides, 10 minutes is the average. Many times a day it'll be 30 minutes between blocks. A few times a week, it's over an hour between blocks. That's not fair to them.

It's going down a lot! For weeks, bitcoinfees.21.co was calculating a fee of about 25c to 35c if you wanted your transaction to be in the next block. 
I guess a lot of people have stopped using Bitcoin so there are less transactions. Getting rid of most of the daily users gives enough capacity to use Bitcoin as a settlement layer. 
Maybe all the banks that banded together to fund R3 to build their blockchain settlement layer will just stop development and move to Bitcoin.

Fair enough. It's not just spreading the word though, it's also validating business concepts and decisions. 
For instance, right now I'm building a bitcoin payment processor that will be good for edge cases not served by existing processors, like built-in affiliate payout functions, splitting profits into another address, distribution of funds according to shares, a strong focus on i2p and Tor, and more. 
Sometimes I might want to come to this community to ask for  feedback and ideas. That's something that can't be done with ads. 
As an example, I've been training a neural network to monitor transactions to see if I can make a confidence factor assessment like BlockCyphers. At the same time, I've heard (but it's just rumors) that some devs want to make 0-confirmation transactions a verboten topic and focus on side chains for those kinds of things. That makes me scared to even discuss the concept because then people will assume that I'm against side chains (I'm not) or against those devs (I'm not, don't even know which ones they are). 
Maybe I AM being too sensitive, but I don't think I'm the only one that has thoughts and opinions that cross into different political camps. I doubt I'm the only one that worries about being ostracized from those groups because of not subscribing to their party line.

Luke has an almost enviable ability to have unshakable beliefs in something, even if it's arguably untrue. 
He seems to have the unshakable belief that BIP148 will work and that it represents the will of "the users". 
If it fails, he'll then have the unshakable belief that he and the other BIP148 proponents did the right thing and will probably believe that the only reason it failed was because of any reason other than the users rejected it. 
I think this might be behind the confusion of why SegWit hasn't passed. He seemingly believed that the activation threshold would be easily met and the only reason it hasn't is because of a small evil cabal working against the entire community.

The problem is that I don't play politics. I don't keep track of which interests which groups are involved in. I think it's a waste of time. Discussion on the merits of a technological decision? I love that kind of discussion and debate. 
Being told that suddenly because I like a certain idea, that I'm a supporter of theymos or mike or gavin? That pisses me off. Or that if I like or dislike components of the sidechains concept, then I'm suddenly supporting or not supporting blockstream. 
I don't give a damn who else likes or doesn't like an idea. I want to debate the idea itself and not be seen as a soldier of some kind of ideological army by the other side.

You're shipping closed &amp; tamper-resistant boxes to bitcoin exchanges that will sit inside their network firewall and have intimate access to nearly all financial traffic?
If I operated an exchange or a bank, this would be a terrifying prospect. You're selling them a network-connected product that's booby-trapped so it can't be examined or verified to not be malicious. I'm not sure that financial services companies would be allowed to do this by security certification bodies or insurance companies. Maybe you could get around it by having signed binaries that are verified by the client before it's put in service, and let them examine the source code, but then you can't allow automated remote updates. 
This whole thing just seems scary. You're basically building a distributed ledger that's based on trusting the participants. It seems like a step backwards in security from Bitcoin for the benefit of faster transactions.

Thanks for sharing this :-) 
The site used to be called SteamLoader. I've been running PremiumGiftCards ([proof]( for over 2 years now and have sold over 500k USD worth of Steam wallet codes. 
I wish I could make things cheaper, but I only make a small % profit on each transaction and right now the money I make from the site pays just enough of my bills that I can focus on building cool new services. 
I am working on a new Bitcoin payment processor (handlecoin.com) and I'll use the gift card site to test it out. 
One of the features will be a customer loyalty sweepstakes. I'm planning on setting aside a small bit of each order and once a week, a random customer will win that pool of BTC. 
I can't really afford to sell the Steam wallet codes for much less than their face value, but I do sell enough that I can put aside enough from every order to give away a $50 or $100 code to a random customer once a week. 
If anyone has any questions, feel free to ask them!

It's not always that cut and dry. While maximizing profits for the shareholders is the goal, many companies take the long-term view. Even Amazon, used in your example, has razor-thin profits because their goal is to become ubiquitous by using all their profits to grow as massively as they can, at the detriment to shareholder value. Eventually they will probably change their business model. 
The same applies to any business that is attempting to dominate their space by removing the competition. Cheap chinese solar manufactures, for example. 
Even Ford and Costco paid/pay it's employees well, despite shareholder anger, but they see it as both a way to make more consumers of their products among their employees and to help with the marketing and PR of the company itself. 
Not all companies operate with the pure capitalistic model. Some play the long game.

CLOSE to non-profit :-) I get the cards at 3% off face value, and using the 24 average price of bitcoin OR the last price (whichever is less) gives me just enough float to make an estimated 5% to 7% profit.

I'm hoping to make enough money to build up 7 days worth of inventory and then I can lower the fees. 
@_date: 2013-10-23 00:44:13
Same thing dozens of threads warn against. They hold your bitcoins for 7 days after you order them. Moments before you are supposed to have them clear, they cancel the transaction if the bitcoins have appreciated too much in value. They brush it off as mitigating suspicious activity but their bot usually only does it when it makes them money. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 19:04:35
Sorry about running out of codes on SteamLoader. I restocked today and think I now have enough money in motion to stay fully stocked at all times. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:42:58
I'm using the blockchain.com API. I give it my primary deposit address and it generates individual deposit addresses for each customer that ends up in the same wallet. During the same API call, I give it a URL to hit to let me know when it sees activity at that address (payments, confirmations, etc). The URL it calls back is on my system and after it's seen that enough money has been deposited to that address and (now) one confirmation has occured, it tells Blockchain to quit calling the URL and then it moves the data around the database and emails the code to the customer. 
I have an additional API that has the exact same basic functionality that I'm building and 1 in 10 transactions uses the new one. Eventually when I've tested it to my satisfaction, I'll move the site over to using that one. I'm building my own equivalent to the blockchain.info API because I'm also trying to integrate an escrow service that I'm building. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 05:20:42
I started a service at [steamloader.com]( that lets people buy wallet codes with bitcoins. I've ironed most of the bugs out and it does do automated delivery after 1 confirmation most of the time (sometimes the blockchain.info API falls apart so it might take a few confirmations when that happens)
@_date: 2013-11-27 08:14:09
GREAT feedback, thanks! I've been stuck in the code for the last few days so it's easy to overlook usability issues. I'll tidy all that up right now
@_date: 2013-10-23 17:36:31
I sent three emails. They just don't seem to care. Last email I just asked them to close my account. Let's hope they can at least do that. It makes me nervous to think that a company that cheated me also has everything they need to pull money from my bank account and all of my identity documents. 
@_date: 2013-10-23 17:12:27
Yep, I bought 10BTC at $135ish around the 14th and minutes before I was supposed to receive the BTC, and days after my money was transferred and cleared into their bank, they claimed it was a suspicious transaction and said they would refund my purchase price. I think the only suspicious thing was that it was about $180 a BTC at that point. 
In previous threads in this reddit, people complained a lot of this happening and the usual response was "email their support, it's probably a mistake" so I did so. No response. It's 3 days later and they still haven't responded.

You can also buy Steam wallet codes on my site: [Steamloader.com](
@_date: 2013-12-08 19:57:24
That's the plan. Right now the price us about 7 to 10% higher than the face while I try to build up enough funds for 7k of inventory so I don't run out all the time. Once that happens the fee will be lowered. Its also since I keep the funds in BTC and I'm trying to build up a buffer to be more resilient against price drops.
@_date: 2013-11-27 14:36:32
I actually want to keep things in BitCoin as much as possible. I'm not a big fan of the payment processors that automatically convert your BTC deposits into cash for you. 
I'm using the BlockChain.info API to generate seperate deposit addresses for each user based on my primary deposit address. The nice thing about that is that they don't need my private key to do it! My wallet doesn't live on my server so even if the site was cracked open like a delicious walnut, at most they would get the steam codes... and I'm working this weekend on implementing a system to codes already given to people are encrypted so even if someone gets into the DB, codes that people bought but haven't redeemed can't be stolen. 
Man, what an oversight about the email field! Yes, it shouldn't ask for your email address again. I'll fix that right away :-)
I'll also get rid of the hyperlink as it's not very useful.

Its too bad that Coinbase can't be trusted. They are spending a lot of money on excellent engineering but ignore customers that they have wronged. The next PayPal? Successful but soulless and routinely screw people over?
@_date: 2013-11-28 21:50:01
Thank you Duron! I appreciate your business. I've had several users report that they had no problems redeeming a USD steam wallet code with their foreign currency steam account. It does the currency conversion for you.
@_date: 2013-12-01 08:51:04
Yea, I bought 3k of inventory from the distributor and then Steam announced their winter sale. Oops. Sold out in 2 days. I'll buy more next week... Hopefully before the end of the sale. 
@_date: 2013-10-23 00:25:29
Until a few days ago, I was totally rooting for coinbase until they stole a thousand bucks from me and their support won't even respond.  Now all I see is them wanting to take away the community-focused bitcointip bot in order to make money on us.
First they come for the reddit tippers and then they go for all micro payments and drive out the competition.
They have already proven themselves to be theives to me. How will they prove it to you?
I suggest using inputs.io
Its a superior product for off-chain micro payments as long as it doesn't require fiat currency conversion. I'm moving about 150BTC a month of small transactions through there very soon for several businesses I run
@_date: 2013-10-23 21:53:22
Problem with coinbase is that if you make too much during the time the transaction is in escrow, they might reverse the transaction just before you get the coins. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 19:27:52
I did have trouble on my first day with what I thought was a forged transaction. It ended up being a problem with the buyers mobile wallet and was resolved, but I learned my lesson!
@_date: 2013-11-27 08:43:18
I'll play around with the layout a bit more tomorrow to try to make a nice way to display my gamer profile and a few other links, as well as make it more obvious how the exchange rate was calculated. 
Tutorial section is a great idea too :-)
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:22:45
OK, site adjusted so one confirmation is required before sending the code. Thanks for the advice :-)
@_date: 2013-12-20 14:24:24
I really appreciate the business and your trust :-)
@_date: 2013-11-27 14:49:58
Man, I would love to, but I don't know how much less I could charge for the cards. Think I should just operate at a loss to get market exposure?
I'm thinking that I could buy a bunch of $5 steam wallet codes and include with the first 50 orders as stocking-stuffer freebies
I would probably want to limit it to one-per-customer so people don't buy 5 $10 cards for $50 and then expect $25 of freebies. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 07:07:08
Same here. I just launched SteamLoader.com today to sell steam wallet codes for bitcoins. I was very proud of my coding and implementation of blockchain.info's API... and then it falls apart on me the last hour or so. I've been having to manually verify every transaction by looking up the deposit address on another service. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 01:15:03
Correct, although the holiday weekend and the Steam sale makes it likely that I'll sell out before I can restock. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 17:41:00
You can also buy Steam wallet codes with Bitcoins on my site [Steamloader.com](
@_date: 2013-11-27 23:48:59
I just started a service to do this. Steamloader.com
@_date: 2013-11-27 13:43:56
That would look nicer. I'll make the change in about an hour when I get to work.
@_date: 2013-09-26 14:07:45
There is an even bigger security vulnerability! If you just dig around the site, you can see everyone's transactions! ;-)
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:30:54
I've already had one user report that the wallet code worked for his account that's in the UK, so you shouldn't have any problems. 
@_date: 2013-10-23 17:25:59
If BTC is worth $250 by next tuesday, don't be surprised if Coinbase cancels the transaction and refund the money to you moments before the coins are supposed to be released to you. It's a good way for them to buy coins using their users money at no risk. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 01:35:21
I got some more stock this afternoon, but I'm finishing fixing a few bugs. It should be up and running again in about 5 hours. I'll send you a message when it is :-)
@_date: 2013-11-27 13:57:36
Is it stupid that I don't really know? I'm pretty sure that Valve would just convert the currency for you to whatever base currency your balance is kept in when you apply the wallet code. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 05:18:28
Thanks for your trust and your business! (that's my site)
@_date: 2013-12-08 20:36:29
That would be awesome for me as a gamer (you should see my steam community profile - I'm a hoarder) but suck as the guy who runs the steamloader .com site :-) I wouldn't be upset though. I would just sell the remaining cards in the inventory and pivot to another business model. Maybe just sell for other alt currencies like litecoin.
@_date: 2013-10-23 16:59:55
You're lucky. Coinbase canceled my transaction in the last few minutes and forced me to accept my refund because the coins appreciated in value too much. It's easy for them to make money when they're gambling with their users money.
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:50:24
I've been concerned about that too! I don't want someone using my service to try to hedge their investments. 
I'm quoting a price based on the 24 hour average, so the price would have to drop hard and stay low for more than 24 hours for it to be useful as a hedge. 
I built the site as a Minimum Viable Product to see if there was any interest, and there does seem to be... so I'll finish a few things that are outstanding. 
Orders that are initiated but not finalized already refuse to send the code after an hour has gone by, but I haven't set up a business process yet on how to refund the money. I'm sure I don't want to do it automatically because that requires me giving my system the power to SEND bitcoins and I just don't like that. 
I also don't have a system in place to routinely clear out the unfinalized transactions, but that's an easy cron job and 5 minutes of coding. 
Also, when someone expresses interest in ordering a code that's out of stock, it's a manual process now to contact them when it's in stock and try to initiate that transaction. I gotta automate that too. 
Thanks for the great advice. I appreciate it!
@_date: 2013-11-29 04:09:31
Just to let everyone know, it appears that NeonLime did get the card, but Yahoo thought it was spam. I've changed the email that's sent to have more text so maybe it won't trigger anything on the mail filters. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 13:36:11
Crap, I didn't know it was so routine. I thought it was too difficult and expensive to pull off that people didn't bother. Do you really think it's worth making people wait for one confirmation?
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:45:59
I sell Steam gift cards for BTC and keep all my reserves in BTC. It's difficult since my material costs are so close to my sales prices, but I'm in this for the long haul. It helps that I spent a few BTC buying inventory when BTC was at it's highest so these low exchange rates are making me more BTC as a profit. It'll just be risky when I need to restock inventory. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 07:42:11
Oh, and just an FYI, double-spend attacks are so difficult and not worth the money to try to scam for $20 gift cards, so once my system sees the transaction, it'll send the code even before 1 confirmation. 
Edit: I ended up requiring confirmations after some hijinks that could be a double spend attack. Not sure yet but if it is, I just have to give valve the wallet codes and they'll suspend the users account that did it.
Any experts willing to dig through some transactions to weigh in?
@_date: 2013-11-27 13:52:41
Just a note, most sales have been $50 cards or $10 cards. I assume that's to both fully fund or to test the concept.
My question is, should I go through the $10 cards and then just restock with $5 cards for people to test the service with? 
Keeping $100 cards in inventory would cost a lot of money but maybe I should have a few?
@_date: 2013-12-12 05:22:12
Thanks for the shoutout for my service :-)
@_date: 2013-12-12 05:19:11
Thanks DotaQUAD for the business! I appreciate it! I just added $100 cards too for the people who kept on buying $50 cards over and over. :-)

It's not just you, blockchain.info is acting weird as hell right now. I use their API to process transactions and I'm not getting any transaction confirmations at all. Sometimes when I go to log into my wallet, it fails with a generic error code. 
I think something is falling apart on their backend right now. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 05:23:29
You were right, Valve wasn't happy with how I worded that and asked me to change it so I did. They also didn't think the change I made to their logo by adding a bitcoin was cute, so I had to dump that too. Other than that, I'm still in business! Next time I'll listen to you. 
@_date: 2013-10-23 15:31:14
Coinbase taking over a lot of the bitcoin ecosystem makes me nervous. They seem to have great engineering skills, but have the morals of PayPal. It might be better to push for other services that seem to be pushing for the betterment of the whole bitcoin community like inputs.io.
@_date: 2013-12-04 00:21:10
Thanks! I got another $1500 of inventory today but I still have a few problems to fix up that were uncovered during the launch. I'll probably have it back up and tested around midnight. I'll send you a PM when it is :-)
@_date: 2013-11-27 08:12:58
Excellent point. I'm not sure how to do that, other than to give the email I got from valve that pointed me to their distributor and then I lose my "t0p sekret" contact... 
Heck, that was the hardest part of this. Valve is a pain in the ass to talk to since they don't have any phone numbers or official job titles for any of their employees. 
@_date: 2013-10-23 15:41:40
Not only that, but they have a history of reversing transactions at the last second before that wait period is over if the BTC's have appreciated in price too much. It's easy to make profit on your customers when it's their money that's taking all the risk
@_date: 2013-10-23 16:15:28

It's actually the first public project in years. My wife and kids and I have decided to move abroad sometime next year so I'm trying to build a portfolio of sites that could provide enough money to survive on, should times get tough. 
I'm building a API for a service that will allow any site to list and complete sales and/or "actions for cash". This is the first site to use that beta api. When all is said and done, it'll let someone set up a market place or jobs for bitcoins site with a very small code base that will be full of listings. The wannabe bitmit markets that are ghost towns are depressing and this way sites can compete with marketing and user interfaces rather than luck about the number of listings. 
edit: made it more obvious that I'm moving abroad with my wife and kids, not that they're going without me ;-)
@_date: 2013-10-23 21:06:48
Coinbase has some of the same problems. If you make too much during the time the transaction is in escrow, they will reverse the transaction just before you get the coins. They also don't often reply to support emails.
@_date: 2013-12-09 19:06:42
In the meantime, use my site [SteamLoader]( to buy Steam Wallet Codes for BTC. :-) 
Truthfully, I won't be upset if Valve accepts bitcoins one day too
@_date: 2013-11-29 02:20:28
email me at adam or PM me and let me know what email address and/or address you sent the BTC to and I'll take care of you

Thats odd. I'll take a look now
@_date: 2013-12-15 01:13:45
Check your email spam folder. Maybe it ended up there, but the system emailed you 19 minutes ago. I'll also send it as a reply to your email. 
@_date: 2013-10-24 03:20:55
I see bitcoin addresses as being like ip adresses. We need the equivalent of DNS so users can pick a nickname or email address or something and assign their addresses to it and so people can just send money to an shortname and it looks it up to find the primary BTC deposit address. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 04:34:04
Just a heads up everyone, I restocked on the bigger denominations and I'm getting another $800 of inventory in the morning. I'm applying for a BTCJam loan. When/if I get it, I'll make sure I never run out of inventory again :-)
@_date: 2013-12-08 19:31:26
That's a totally fair question. I'm not sure if "authorized distributor" is even the correct terminology. Basically, Valve has an exclusive license with a Game distributor company in California that handles all of the Steam Wallet Code and Steam Gift Card sales to retail stores and online stores in the US, and I'm buying the codes direct from the distributor. 
Compared to the other resellers who just go into Walmart and buy a stack of gift cards off the shelf, that seemed "authorized" enough. If you think the language isn't fair, do you have any recommendations? I could try explaining all that, but it doesn't really fit too well under the logo ;-)
@_date: 2013-11-27 09:05:06
That's a very good point. What do you think about displaying a QR code on the webpage and then emailing the deposit address?
I do want to make it so if they leave the page up it'll just show the steam code when it's arrived, but I have to work on my jQuery skills and also double check everything related to that to make sure that it doesn't open up an exploit where someone could figure out the display URL and cycle through all the purchased gift cards. 
By limiting the code delivery to email, and only when the transaction has been confirmed, it makes it a bit harder for someone to dump the database. 
My thought is that if a person makes a mistake with their email address AND sends money from the address on the webpage, they'll email me all pissed off that they didn't get the code and I can just manually copy-paste it to them (for now). 
Thanks for the feedback, I find it invaluable. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:18:00
Your wish is my command! I'm finishing up adding email validation and then I'll add a QR code. Give me about an hour
@_date: 2013-11-27 14:53:49
Brilliant. I'll set that up within the hour and hash the already sold cards. If someone did hack the site and stole unsold steam wallet codes... well, that would suck and I would take the loss... 
I wouldn't find it acceptable for someone to be able to steal a wallet code that was already sold but wasn't redeemed yet. It could screw up someones gift or something and is a way to make customers never trust me again. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 18:16:35

You're not going to get a lot of business by calling your potential customers stupid, even if they don't see the "loophole" that you've let exist. If your customer is saying that the site isn't attractive for one reason, then you either need to make it more obvious on how to bypass that problem or to address it more directly. 
Resorting to insults isn't going to help. Neither is your terrible grammar and spelling, btw. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:02:03
I'll make the adjustment so $20 and lower is instant, $50 and $100 cards will take one confirmation.
