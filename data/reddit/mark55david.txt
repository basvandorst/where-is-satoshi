the documents wasn't wrong it was for my dads i did violate the terms of service i admit it 
i didn't **Repeatedly ** lied about my identity 
actually you did took my coins 
and there was no even a line in the terms of service that says 
that i have to open an account at your website cryptocapital.co
to get back my coins
 
**it's easy to blame someone so you can steal from him**
there was an account that belongs to my sister not me and she is 19 and she can send those documents but you said you won't replay to me again
i want the rest of my bitcoins which is going to be fair and i'll give you all the documents of my father with no false documents
he can get the coins on behalf of me 
again **there was no line that says i had to contact you to get my coins back**

may i know what happened to **my** coins?
@_date: 2016-04-24 11:33:12
exactly i asked them as i wrote if my father receive this funds on behalf of me they didn't answer although i gave them the documents they asked for !

that didn't answer my question
and that also means that 1btcxe has the rest of my coins
i need a solution to get the rest of coins back 
and you gonna answer like this 
if you do 1 and 2 and 3 we shall give you your coins
i only agreed because you were going to give me none of my coins and that was totally unfair
i can give you all the documents of my father now as i got the notarized document you asked for and can get the coins on behalf of me

i remember one of your last messages was we will give you only a thousand as a courtesy you didn't say anything about the returning my remaining bitcoins ! you still don't have the right to do that i need a solution now
