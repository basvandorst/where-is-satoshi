Just read the discussion and back and forth and we would like to contribute a couple comments.
1. Currently the sale of 80% Lower Receivers or as the BATF calls them "Lower Receiver Blanks" is legal. We currently have our ATF Determination Letter received and on file from the ATF, which states our product does not constitute a firearm. We agree with Julian702 and believe he is correct.
2. Picture Issue: As stated above, we have just read the below comments from "ferroh" pertaining to the pictures and the likelihood of our site being a scam. We are currently uploading raw photos of both the AR-10 and AR-15 to our website, and we will also be uploading production photos to our website. In the mean time, anyone can view photos of our products at our facebook page: 
As we continue our productions runs we will be uploading additional photos of the process and our product in the various production phases.
3. The price issue raised by thefuryoffire: "This is a scam simply because of the price - 80% lowers should be around $80-$100 tops"
We have a couple points here: There are two primary ways to begin the process of machining a Lower Receiver. First is to begin with a Forging, the second is to use a Billet. Forgings are significantly less expensive to machine than billet. A second point is the grade of aluminum used, a manufacturer will typically use either 7075-T6 or 6061 Aluminum. 7075-T6 Aircraft Grade Aluminum is considerably more expensive than 6061. The third point is the machining process used to machine the Magazine Well. Typically, a manufacturer will choose one of three options: Broach the mag well, Machine the mag well, or EDM the mag well. The EDM operation is significantly more expensive than the broach or machine method.
With the above details in mind, thefuryoffire is correct in saying that a Lower Receiver should be $80-$100 tops when the manufacturer is begining from a forging, using 6061 Aluminum, and machining the magazine well.
However, this price range is very difficult to achieve for us because we are beginning from a Billet, using 7075-T6 Aluminum, and using the EDM operation to cut the Magazine Well.
That being said we have been working diligently to find ways to reduce costs on our end and we are currently offering an option of either 7075-T6 or 6061 for the AR-15 Models, and we are negotiating with several Forging Houses to procure raw forging Blanks.
Our current pricing is as follows:
AR-15 (7075-T6) - $155.00
AR-15 (6061)     -  $135.00
AR-10 (7075-T60 - $175.00
Our current prices are very competitive in the current market and as stated above, we are looking for ways to reduce our costs.
We appreciate all comments and thank you for your time.
