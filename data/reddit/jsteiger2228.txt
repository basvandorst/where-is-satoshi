So, my sister with ADHD, Turrets Syndrome and Lyme Disease said to my dad the other day:  "*swears* Why can't we get the roof to our double-wide fixed, cause it's raining where Myrtle, our 3-legged dog sleeps. *swears*"  My dad replied that the disability benefits don't pay enough, and Myrtle will have to wait until Brandi, our 2-legged dog dies so that she can have a dry place to sleep.  I piped up and volunteered to get a tarp at Wal-Mart, but then I remembered I can't ride bikes since the accident at the battery factory.  I get the vertigo so bad, my drunk-ass mom and her boyfriend walk straighter than me.  I aint no computer expert, but I have some kinda bitcoin wallet address:  1MyZeRdTrHF1ViGxGowfDJAsYf9HhbbkfY
Maybe we'll have enough left over for some crystal so that we can celebrate our newly found dryness.

I could give him credit for being clever enough to spread misinformation that plays to the basic fears of anyone looking into Bitcoin for the first time, but his tone and choice of words lead me to believe that he actually doesn't understand Bitcoin at all.  Wow.

No, they drive an automatic, so they are still a douche.

Yes - and everyone there knew something about Bitcoin, and it was not treated as a joke.  Impressive indeed.
@_date: 2014-09-28 23:18:49
You're darn tootin'!!

Bitcoin is in Earth orbit currently.  I'm waiting for NASA to give the word "go" for trans-lunar injection.

*Ahem* - Reddit "is" hiring a cryptocurrency engineer.

Stephen Colbert interviewed Barney Frank a few years back.  This is how Stephen walked.
@_date: 2014-09-19 12:16:00
Yes.  Buy! buy! buy!
@_date: 2014-01-21 02:14:38
Hmm, yes - because the coding of the Blockchain app has nothing to do with this issue.  It's an Apple problem.  Right.

I'm going to save this to my folder where I keep all such ridiculous claims.  In 10 years, I'm going to find the author and remind them what they wrote.

Thanks in advance...

So much insight....  Can't take it all in.

He coined the term for fractional bitcoin:  .00000001 BTC = 1 CyberClam.

Put cash in an unmarked brown paper bag.  Drop it at the mall in the trash can to the left of Starbucks (the one near Hollister, not the one near the Apple store).  In 5 days, I'll put a rolled-up paper wallet in the coin return of the old unused phone booth in the same mall near Orange Julius.

I think he meant to say "libertarians" instead of "conservatives".

1 BTC for a pic of an Amish guy using this ATM...

Would bang all three.
EDIT- Lighten up. This is Reddit (sigh).

Sorry- I meant the last 12 months.   "The best interview this year" doesn't say much if it's only jan 10. 
@_date: 2015-01-10 19:12:28
This is, without a doubt, the best Bitcoin-related interview I have seen this year.
@_date: 2016-01-07 16:34:33
I had to take a couple minutes to absorb all the insight this article serves up.   
@_date: 2016-01-07 18:14:34
I want that job.

Good luck trying to figure out your taxes.

I grow tired of these news sources treating Bitcoin as some kind of weird sideshow, and act like they can't believe they've sunk this low to be talking about it.  Save all these clips.  It will be interesting in 20yrs.
@_date: 2017-11-18 13:19:01
Fake or not, it’s a great scenario to ponder. 
@_date: 2015-11-01 01:29:57
....aaaaaaand everyone on the continent clicked "sell"...
@_date: 2015-02-20 14:21:07
TIL you can buy bacon with Bitcoin.  No stopping it now...
