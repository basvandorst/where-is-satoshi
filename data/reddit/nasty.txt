I know it sounds that way but if you understand how the checkpoint system works in blackcoin only a centralized authority can decide on forks. Currently the only way to decentralize this would be PoW but I believe rat4 is working on another way to do this.

I may not be describing it correctly, but in theory POS is vulnerable as stated by people before me. That said, POS2.0 prevents some of these vulnerabilities as with coin age - collecting old private keys.

This is why I never partied. Only danced a little.

I'm trying to but you keep bashing it. I said I like some of the applications of Smart Contracts and Decentralized exchanges. I have nothing against having other coins implement these ideas, this is exactly WHY BitHalo exists for Bitcoin.

I did hop on this thread to bring attention to blackcoin :) pumping? I dunno about that, I just want people to be aware that it exists - just like everyone else (EVERY FUCKING COIN EVER wants adoption, so don't look at me like i'm doing something different than other people)

decentralized checkpoints actually solve the NaS problem.
That's being done.

I'm not trying to pose a complete solution, I like the transaction speed, staking, and Blackcoin products. Blackcoin will not replace bitcoin but it would be nice if it replaced litecoin. I know I'm dreaming, but there are loads of crappy coins, sometimes one may pick a coin for its community. Blackcoin is that coin for me, not to mention BitHalo/BlackHalo and NightTrader.

But that's not the ONLY thing I want. I want Trustless/Smart contracts, I want decentralized exchanges, I want a supportive community who refuses to sell despite large dumps.
..and Blackcoin provides all that.
