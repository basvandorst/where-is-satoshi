Cool let me know when it has a billion dollar market cap
@_date: 2018-03-30 21:31:02
We haven't had a dip like this since 2014, so I am guessing this is your second?
@_date: 2018-03-31 02:09:35
What’s the problem? 
@_date: 2018-03-31 00:28:42
Highly doubt we will ever see 1K again. Anything’s possible, but very unlikely

when the crypto market drops, Bitfinex makes money on trades. When the crypto market goes up, Bitfinex makes money on trades. market volatility encourages trades, whether the move is up or down. Bitfinex wins either way.

-60% is not a dip or a correction

@_date: 2018-03-31 01:57:26
I wouldn’t sell short or go long now. Now is when you wait to untether or hodl
@_date: 2018-03-31 02:13:05
Doubtful. I’m no fudder, but price will stabilize before it starts sustainably crawling up again
@_date: 2018-02-25 19:51:04
it's way higher than 30%
@_date: 2018-03-30 20:01:07
Don’t worry. Next dip will hurt less. The one after that wont feel like anything.

We have not hit despair yet. When you stop coming to the sub, when you stop checking the price, when all the HODL threads disappear, when only bears are posting, then we will be near the bottom. My guess, which is as good as any, is around $2-3K

you have an interesting post history, my dude
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:04:42
wait at least a year before you sell to avoid paying income tax on your gains. Capital gains tax will be a lower rate.

The goal is not for crypto to replace fiat currency. Fiat currency didn't replace gold, it is complementary.
@_date: 2018-02-24 19:17:02
For tax purposes, how are you guys treating the Bcash you received from Coinbase in December?
Would it be fair, from a tax perspective, to treat this as $0, since that’s what you spent to obtain them, and recognize the full value at time of sale as a gain? 
@_date: 2018-03-31 02:05:30
Statistically unlikely that the next quarter will be able to repeat this percentage drop. Chances are more likely that next quarter will see a smaller percentage move, could be positive or negative, but will not be as big of a move as this last quarter was. Make no mistake, we are still deep in bear country.

No accountant agrees with you and you will owe taxes on crypto- to-crypto gains as well as penalties and possibly face jail time. Don’t play chicken with the IRS

He could have picked any headline or no headline and just the date. He chose this one specifically related to central banks printing money, it was clearly deliberate.

Also “buy low, sell high”, “don’t catch a falling knife”, and “bulls and bears make money, pigs get slaughtered”

I saw it touch $1000 and believed it would touch $1000 again and higher.  The utility of being able to send value anywhere quickly and without using a financial institution was amazing to me. Told my friends about it and nobody else invested (2014).

This whole comment section is a huge buy signal. OP, you dun goofed by buying all in at once. Breaking out your buy in over time is a better way to enter a position. You should consider doing the same when you exit in a couple of years.
