You got that right. We have many of these "manager" types at my shop too and they totally shift things in the wrong direction at times. Combined with lower levels of management who "do not rock the boat" allowing the bad policies to go on. 
You see this a lot in large corporations. So long as the company is making money in spite of bad management decisions people just want to keep the status quo.

I get this too. Some people a just tools. They only follow the pack and make fun of anyone or anything that goes outside the allowable thinking. This goes for Bitcoin or anything that is not mainstream.

Fractional Reserve banking. The magic of making money out of thin air!
I deposit $1000, the bank then loans out $900. I can still take out my $1000 at anytime; so basically, that $900 came out of the air like magic. 
The person who borrowed the $900, can then deposit it into another bank. The second bank can then  loan out $810, so by now we have $2710 in the system. $1710 came out of thin air.  
Do this over and over and over and over and the magic money really starts to add up. 
Like adding water to soup. It thins it out and makes it weak. That is why your dollar gets weak and it takes more of them to buy something.

Yep. Cash angers them too, because the control is not as tight as say a Debit or Credit translation. That is why you are seeing a slow removal of cash. Large denominations first...then smaller and smaller until you are forced to keep a credit/debit card. This is actually happening internationally in various countries that have central banks. They will claim it's for your own protection, but in the end it will be about control of you and the money supply.

The Fed was born out of a secret meeting of politicians and big bankers back in 1913. By my math, that is a bit after the founding fathers.

No good picks this round. In fact it gets worse each cycle. We are in a downward spiral toward a totalitarian government. People can't see it, because it's happening slowly.

The average voter has no core political principles. They vote based on whatever sound byte they last heard, or which candidate is going to give them the most free stuff, or which candidate is pushed the most by the media, or by blindly pulling a party lever in the voting booth for the one their parents and grand parents taught them to pull for. Look at Ron Paul, he was principle and consistency like no other. Yet, he never was going to be president. The ruling class has already indoctrinated average voters into the game long ago. Like Ron, the best Bernie is going to do is teach and pass on his message in hopes the future will be won. 
You are going to see Hilary getting the nomination. ...and on the (R) side, it will be Rubio or a Bush type.  It's what the ruling classes want to keep the machine going.

Amen!   That's just how fiat currencies work. Not being pegged to anything sound, like gold or silver for example, it is only as good as the lies and false trust that governments and people put into it. The markets, however, will always prevail and one day the USD will be no more or a loaf or bread will be $10,000.  But of course our "elite leaders" think they know better and can control markets that have been proven over history to be uncontrollable long term.

You hit the nail on the head. Our world has become so "cradle to grave" dependent on the government and centralized power it's insane. People love to cheer their bumper sticker slogans for freedom, but in reality if the had true freedom they would not know what to do. They fear it. We've fallen a long way from our freedom loving forefathers...and centralized power knows/loves that fact. This is why any opinion contrary to the "allowed public opinion" is quickly demonized. They do not want the masses learning they are being controlled.
