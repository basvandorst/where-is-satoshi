I feel like this sinking is price manipulation by whales that are trying to bottom out the price to make sick gains in 2020
@_date: 2019-11-24 23:39:01
True. The way it's falling and I hope the mods don't flag me for this but, the bottom is looking like 4100 by the end of December. So if it does moon to six figs in 2021, it's time to stack stack stack.

Unless I were convinced that hodling was the better option.
@_date: 2019-11-18 22:01:15


Thank you. My english, it not so goot.
@_date: 2019-11-28 16:39:24
Yeah and if my aunt had balls she’d be my uncle.
@_date: 2019-11-21 15:29:12
Get this horse Shiza out of here. No way do these 2020 predictions come true. No. Way. Realistically we’ll see 35k by the end of the year, no higher.
@_date: 2019-11-20 01:26:55
You're not alone with this thought. Under 7 by the end of Feb def and under 8 by the end of this month.
@_date: 2019-11-24 18:19:34
I mean, define short time. Told myself that if it ever hit 100k that I'd sell what i've got
@_date: 2019-11-22 17:00:52
Bitcoin fly like an eagle....
@_date: 2019-11-18 23:28:03
And then all their bitcoins will belong to us. Mua ha ha aaha ha!
@_date: 2019-11-18 21:15:58
I hope you're right. Instincts tell me it's gonna drop hard before the holiday season. My analysis puts it at a 40% drop before the end of the year. Good to buy low though and stack stack stack.
@_date: 2019-11-18 23:27:13
It’s cool if you don’t see it. Hoping the mods will let me leave this post here for a time stamp.
@_date: 2019-11-25 16:23:08
Compared to where it is now, $100k is totally a moon. Maybe not the moon we HODLers want, but I'd be stoked for $100k
@_date: 2019-11-30 05:52:09
Fly, you fools!
@_date: 2019-11-18 18:45:19
GD it Steve!
@_date: 2019-11-24 17:43:28
Bitcoin will never reach $100000 moon. Prove me wrong. I want to be wrong.

What are your thoughts on bitcoin sinking in price when we're so close to the halvening? Do you see it continuing to fall before it eventually moon's in 2020?
@_date: 2019-11-13 19:45:01
Do you have a source you can site for this fact?
@_date: 2019-11-18 21:11:35
Which means we'll have to buy more!
@_date: 2019-11-18 21:13:38
Hopefully they're happy fireworks
@_date: 2019-11-20 02:33:16
I still have faith it'll reach a nice high after June in 2020. It'll be a nice dip down to 6.5 and then it'll hit 25k by Dec
@_date: 2019-11-28 16:40:29
If it goes to 0, I’m buying all the bitcoins!
@_date: 2019-11-25 02:58:34
Lies. It's gonna be under 6900 for a while. At least until May. The way it's moving now, it'll hit 4800 by the end of December.
@_date: 2019-10-27 16:45:01
The day bitcoin went to the moon
@_date: 2019-10-30 19:15:13
Ooo, thank you. I did.
@_date: 2019-10-23 17:24:05
Same, bro. Same. Dive, dive, dive.
@_date: 2019-10-28 17:34:54
I just made my first purchase last week. I'm going to keep on hodling until it goes to the moon. What tax advice do you give to noobies like me when claiming assets and what would a noobie do when they want to turn the asset into cash?
@_date: 2019-10-30 18:46:32
Hmm. So, you’re predicting over 100k by end of 2020?
@_date: 2019-10-31 15:14:12
Happy Birthday!
@_date: 2019-10-29 02:08:15
I have a cold storage ledger. Hopefully this helps when I start making trades.

Free will is still influenced by trends and patterns  **¯\\\\\_(ツ)\_/¯**
@_date: 2019-10-30 18:14:48
If we can't have the moon. Let's stay hopeful to reach mesosphere.
@_date: 2019-12-12 16:10:07
Free is to have your money grow as opposed to losing value over time. I'll look it up in a minute if anyone calls me out on this but, I remember that every since we left the gold standard in the 70's the value of cash goes down 2% of every year, but wages don't increase every year. So People are working themselves into poverty believing in a fiat system that is turning them into slave labor. Sorry for ranting, I'm riding high on the aderall express.

BTC. Duh
