Make sure you have 2step auth set on your coinbase wallet!

You're not too late. Never take financial advice from people that are broke.

Honestly, I think that having too much money shouldn't be compared to having too little. Having too much money isn't a problem, the problem is the wrong person having too much money. What is the worst thing that can happen if you have way more money than you need? That you aren't going to live enough to use it? Now, what is the worst thing that can happen if you didn't have enough? You don't eat nor does your family, you can't afford medical care, you don't have a home to provide. Basically you are either lacking basic necessities for survival or struggling to provide them. We used to base our survival off of how well we hunted, farmed, and built. It is now based off of how well we are able to generate money.

No problem, I'm actually quite new and am using coinbase and mtgox with 2stepauth in both. I have heard that printing a paper wallet is the most secure.

Just because people make money, does not make them greedy nor is wanting it. Society has conditioned us into thinking that having money is bad. It isn't it's a necessity and having an excess of it makes one feel secure, because no matter what money problem hits you the stress is gone. I'm sure cavemen wouldn't try to be "humble" and take only a leg of the animal they hunted, they're gonna take the whole damn thing. So don't think of yourself as greedy, you are ambitious and that doesn't have to be bad. Now, of course you are going to be obsessed with BTC. You have seem results, you understand it well enough to possibly make a living off of it, and I'm pretty sure you enjoy doing it. A lot of times you think you know what you want to do career wise, but when you truly find it, it just clicks. You're doing something different that most people wouldn't want to do because they are lazy, there is too much risk, or they are comfortable where they are.  The reward of that can be significant. In my opinion, we only have one life, and wanting the best out of it isn't evil.
