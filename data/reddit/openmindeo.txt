I'm from Venezuela and I buy 0,03btc monthly (almost a month of minimum wage here) but recently with the drop caused by the fork of bitcoinxt I started to reconsider to save in btc, should I worry about this? should I keep saving even with these kind of drops? I'm worried because I feel like I started to lose my money, even if it drops 1$ here is too much.

I live in the capital, although the internet is the worst in the continent is better than the one in the interior of the country, I use the traditional home broadband but when I need less latency I use the 4g network offered by some private companies which is expensive given the little infrastructure that exists for that service, usually I do mining, I have an s9 asic and a gpu rig (mining altcoins which I convert into bitcoin) which is profitable given the extremely subsidized electricity, bitcoin which is what I use mostly to hodl and spend on food and house rent which is very cheap if I have income from outside, I also work as a freelance web developer and ask to be paid in bitcoin which I can change to bolivars with localbitcoins, for that reason I have not bought bitcoin using bolivars since I do not generate income with that currency.
