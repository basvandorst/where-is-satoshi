Look before you post man. 
@_date: 2014-10-11 12:22:12
Your circle jerk didn't really go as planned i see. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 14:24:17
It's not cool and new anymore. 
@_date: 2014-10-04 21:02:21
Ouch. 
The dollar is gonna collaaaaaapse. Look what's collapsing instead. 
@_date: 2014-10-10 23:18:31
Thinking you can predict what Bitcoin will do 10 years from now is completely retarded. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 09:54:02
Sorry, a lot of people just lost most of their investment. 
@_date: 2014-10-10 22:53:22
No no they were really just shitting their pants. 
@_date: 2014-10-11 12:35:59
We don't know if it's illegally obtained. That's what Ulbricht's lawyers say. 
That's the problem here everytime something about Ross gets posted. 
The fbi is wrong by default and everything his lawyers and his mother say is true by default. 
@_date: 2014-10-07 18:17:52
Thank god theft is not possible with Bitcoin. 
Let the circle jerk start!
@_date: 2014-10-07 22:40:37
Yes this is a massive problem. 
Let's assume a lot of shops start accepting Bitcoin. Small transaction will go through without a confirmation but imagine 1000's of people buying thing like tv's, cars and other expensive stuff. A lot of store owners will want to use 1 confirmation before they give away their products worth 1000's. Well, there you are, in the store waiting for a hour before you can leave with your product. 
Yet somehow most Bitcoiners will tell you this is not a problem. And they will back this up by saying a credit card will take 6 months to confirm. 
I don't think i have to explain how ridiculous that argument is. As we all know you will leave the store 1 minute after paying with one. 
Now watch my post get downvoted to oblivion without one person giving me a good reason where my argument is flawed. 
This subject is simpy a taboo here. It doesn't exist. It isn't a problem. We don't talk about it. 
@_date: 2014-10-09 06:44:25
Yes. Everyone is gonna turn to Bitcoin because of that news. Obviously. 
@_date: 2014-10-09 07:02:14
Of course. They love drugs and Bitcoin so Ross is their hero so that means he is innocent and his lawyers are always right. 
@_date: 2014-10-12 19:28:20
This hasn't been discussed 100's of times before. 
@_date: 2014-10-08 02:00:29
Stop acting as if it's just 1 or 2 people a day might be affected by this and that they have no problem waiting.
If Bitcoin gets big then it will affect 1000's of sales a day. 1000's of people in all kinds of stores with expensive products will need to wait 10 to 60 mins for their payment to clear. That simply doesn't work in real life. Period. 
@_date: 2014-10-11 05:53:43
You are a fucking retard, you know that right?
@_date: 2014-10-06 07:59:43
Children's playground here. 
@_date: 2014-10-09 22:29:39
A really desperate attemp at a circle jerk. 
@_date: 2014-10-11 12:28:43
Good point the Judge has. 
If Ulbricht is innocent and he has nothing to do with that server then why would he care if it was hacked or not. 
His privacy wasn't violated because he claims this server wasn't his. 
@_date: 2014-10-11 15:21:15
He was a completely insane Bitcoin cultist. Telling everyone to buy Bitcoin because they will be worth milliobs. Now the price went down he suddenly moved to silver. 
@_date: 2014-10-07 05:37:18
How do they define a digital currency?
@_date: 2014-10-05 18:49:01
Every 10 minutes the same post. All day long. 
@_date: 2014-10-11 10:44:55
The confirmation times will be a massive problem if Bitcoin ever really goes mainstream. So far this has been completely ignored. Any mention of it gets ridiculed and downvoted. 
I have no idea why other than just pretending it doesn't exist and we're not allowed to talk about because it actually is a big problem. 
A perfect example of how this issue gets "dealt with". 
@_date: 2014-10-09 10:29:21
Not just that. Anybody with a little bit of common sense and internet experience would right away know this is bs. 
But since this place is filled with greedy broke kids they all fall for this bullshit. The stupidity in this sub every day is just insane. 
@_date: 2014-10-09 11:48:37
Stop spamming you idiot
@_date: 2014-10-07 12:12:58
Fuck, that's funny. 
@_date: 2014-10-08 12:44:57
Thanks for starting topic 40 about it. Your opinion is important like that. 
@_date: 2014-10-09 10:23:20
I wish this place would be 18+. Some age verification would be nice. Hell, make that 21+
@_date: 2014-10-10 20:08:32
It's their role to prevent fraud and shady transactions in general. It's amazing how little people here understand about banks. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 16:18:00
Yes we know. We really do. 
@_date: 2014-10-11 09:58:04
Just read the whole thread and see yourself how the Bitcoin community deals with this problem. Hint: it involves a lot of downvoting and heads in asses. 
@_date: 2014-10-06 13:42:27
Yes kiddo, we know. 
It's been posted about 150 times in the last 12 months. 
@_date: 2014-10-04 23:01:15
I read it. Can't find any proof. Please stop acting like a 12 year old retard. Do you have it or not?
@_date: 2014-10-04 21:04:48
Stop being a fool. It's a bad thing. An extremely bad thing. Only a Bitcoin cultist in complete denial would say something else. 
How do you know the price will go and stay up? Your crystal ball told you so?
@_date: 2014-10-06 20:40:37
What the hell? Why am i being downvoted? Seriously, wtf is wrong with you people. 
I'm very interested in what this company is going to do but i can't figure it out from his post. So i simply ask him what that means exactly. 
This sub is crazy. Downvoted to hell because i ask for more information because i'm interested. 
@_date: 2014-10-11 06:09:42
Stop it with these threads here. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 13:53:53
What is there possibly to downvote??
@_date: 2014-10-12 16:41:00
Instead of starting a new thread why don't you do a search and answer your own question. So we can avoid having 50 threads with exactly the same question just like the 30 previous times a scam mail went out. 
I can't believe this shit still is still posted about. If i get a scam mail i delete it and move on. Are all you people new to the internet or what?
@_date: 2014-10-05 14:33:28
The existing topic on the mainpage wasn't good enough for you?
@_date: 2014-10-04 21:57:05
It will bounce back why exactly?
@_date: 2014-10-05 12:31:40
Stop these fucking posts! You're shitting your pants. We get it!
@_date: 2014-10-05 16:19:06
And you didn't expect this? How long have you been here?
@_date: 2014-10-04 23:21:38

Does the the original post looks like learning about Bitcoin to you? Nothing wrong with learning but you kids post non stop nonsense and stupid memes here.

Welcome to the internet. Your first day i assume?

Wtf are you talking about?
@_date: 2014-10-10 18:17:01
I have more coins than all you dumbass kids in this thread together. But unlike you morons i understand how banks work and i don't live in a Bitcoin fantasy land. 
That they block certain transactions has to do with a bunch of things and shaking in their boots because of Bitcoin isn't one if them. Believe me. 
@_date: 2014-10-06 16:27:20
Can you kids please start your own Bitcoin subreddit? Please?
@_date: 2014-10-11 11:39:35
Welcome to @_date: 2014-10-12 21:23:10
Ask them if they will get out of the dollar because billions of it is used to buy drugs and hitmen. 
@_date: 2014-10-11 15:50:05
From that thread:
Tons of store owners are gonna want 1 confirmation. That's how real life works. No matter how much you think they won't. But just downvote me and the problem will dissapear.
@_date: 2014-10-10 23:21:18
What a surprise a Bitcoin cultist living in fantasy land like you is upset that another cultist gets criticized. It's exactly people like you what Bitcoin doesn't need.

Asking people on Reddit what to do with your money, especially Bitcoiners, is as stupid as it gets. 
@_date: 2014-10-11 12:32:58
Hilarious how now Bitcoiners decide who is allowed to use Bitcoin and who isn't. I'm sure that was exactly Satoshi's goal when he created Bitcoin. 
"We want to be free from the system. And then we're gonna tell who can and can't use Bitcoin". 
@_date: 2014-10-05 18:09:40

Just fuck off man. Everyone is tired of your bullshit posts. 
@_date: 2014-10-11 12:38:11
We don't. Because Bitcoin is for everyone, remember? It was made to avoid control by others. 
@_date: 2014-10-07 14:17:48
Yeah, totally not expected. 
@_date: 2014-10-09 10:30:11

@_date: 2014-10-06 08:48:17
Do you really think that wasn't posted many times already?
@_date: 2014-10-11 12:30:28
I think they rejected it as this is not his fight. He claims the server is not his so he shouldn't be the one to fight the FBI because of this. It has no place in this trial. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 19:48:11
"The price doesn't matter. It's about the protocol" @_date: 2014-10-05 16:51:20

I replied to this:
Its still the lowest cost way to send money through the Internet. 
And my answer was nothing that deserved a downvote.

I gave many friends full coins and they are all doing perfectly fine. Get real. 
@_date: 2014-10-11 10:47:52
So it is a massive problem if that is the case. 
@_date: 2014-10-11 11:25:30
Not this shit again man. It's not even relevant. It's not even an argument how the transaction times are not a problem. 
Can you think for yourself or are you just blindly gonna repeat something other people posted before you?
@_date: 2014-10-04 23:04:00
Please back up your claim about these big players. Thanks.

Who wires money when they go out to buy a tv? Idiot. 
These moronic comments every time this problem is mentioned actually confirms it is a problem.
If it wasn't a problem these idiot replies wouldn't show up every time. 
@_date: 2014-10-11 10:50:27
So you admit it's a problem. That would be a first here. Could it be???
@_date: 2014-10-06 14:25:39
Stop feeding the troll. 
@_date: 2014-10-06 13:14:02
Ooh careful now. Don't mention that the dollar is getting stronger here. You will be nailed to a cross. 
The dollar is about to collapse. Only thing allowed on this sub.

How is someone who sells 30k coins a bear? Isn't he just a seller?
Is everyone who sells his coins a bear?
Aren't bears traders who hope for the price to go down? I must be missing something. 
@_date: 2014-10-09 18:39:45
The amount of people who ask us if we can look into the future is just insane. 
What goes on in your head if you ask random people on the internet what the price of Bitcoin will do. 
How the fuck is anybody supposed to know this. 
To the op: the fastest way to lose your money is by asking people who are invested in Bitcoin what to do with your money. Get a clue. 
@_date: 2014-10-06 20:42:03
No, because it's posted 15 times already. And every time out of context as well. 
@_date: 2014-10-12 21:53:06

@_date: 2014-10-04 22:57:56
Some questions. 
Who is this big money?
When will the ETF launch.
Why would they sell all these coins?
Where are they buying?
Proof, sources etc. 
@_date: 2014-10-08 00:59:41
Ah yes. Most people. Just a matter of trust right?
@_date: 2014-10-05 16:18:29
Yes we know. Please stop. 
@_date: 2014-10-07 05:05:12
So nothing is gonna happen? Just a lot of fake hype by the OP?
@_date: 2014-10-05 18:44:30
Stop it with these posts man. 20 times a day the same post, the same question, the same answers. Just stop.  
@_date: 2014-10-11 12:06:38
Here we go again. First of all it's not 10 mins. It can take 30 minutes or more. And second you do exactly what everyone else here does. You act as if it's just 1 or 2 people who are affected and they have no problem waiting. 
No, just stop doing that. We are talking mainstream. We're talking about 100.000's of transactions a day of which maybe 3% will require 1 confirmation. That means 1000's of people every day in all kinds of shops will have to wait anywhere from 10 minutes to 1 hour before they can leave the store. 
You have to be really, really ignorant and way into Bitcoin fantasy land to consider this not a problem. 
Any sane person with a sense of reality will realize that doesn't work. 
Are you one of them?
By the way, hilarious how you accuse me of poor logic while you simply ignore how real life works. 
@_date: 2014-10-09 07:01:10
Funny how all you druggies consider Ross your hero for running Silk Road but at the same time keep saying he is innocent.

Sadly these threads never make it to the mainpage so we can start a real discussion about it. Downvoting it to hell is how it's usually solved here.

@_date: 2014-10-07 14:18:35

@_date: 2014-10-11 13:10:14
Yup. 
@_date: 2014-10-11 15:38:38
Great argument. Because you will do so it's not a problem. I'm sure the 1000's of other people who would need to wait up to 1 hour after buying a tv agree with you. 
@_date: 2014-10-04 22:05:43
Yes we get it. The same thing is posted every 15 minutes. We get it. 
Bitcoin is amazing, price means nothing and everything will be fine.

@_date: 2014-10-05 21:02:13
Yes we got it. When Bitcoin crashes nobody cares about the price. I learned that today after reading it in a new thread every 10 minutes. 
@_date: 2014-10-10 22:51:16
Well said. Every time i read these stories i just cringe. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 13:18:17
Ok, you solved it. Amazing.

Someone who uses the word lol is calling me a child. Really?

Yes. You are simply not allowed to mention it here. It drives people nuts because it's a fundamental problem. 
@_date: 2014-10-04 22:06:55
No. Just answer my question. With proof to back up your claim of course. 
@_date: 2014-10-11 16:05:24
I know how Bitcoin works. No need to explain it to me. And i don't care what you buy or not. 
@_date: 2014-10-06 12:10:03
The amount of complete nonsense the kids on this sub come up with every day is just insane. 
@_date: 2014-10-11 11:45:16
It's because they simply have no other choice. They can't let the customer wait for 6 months. 
Now with Bitcoin they do have that choice and when presented with that choice they will want to use that. Isn't the security part exactly the part you and everyone else is raving about?
Someone who sells a 3k tv or a 15k car (normal daily transactions) who has the option to use 1 confirmation will want to use it. 
They are not just gonna trust the customer like many here who live in Bitcoin la la land suggested. 
Basically you are saying credit cards are evil, Bitcoin is extremely safe, but they won't and shouldn't use the confirmation safety everyone here is raving about. 
Ah yes, that makes so much sense. 
But just downvote it and it will go away. Who cares about reality if you can live in a fantasy world. 
@_date: 2014-10-06 15:33:22
Amazing. You must be even more retarded than the op.

Please just stop posting this. It's been enough. 
@_date: 2014-10-11 10:58:58
That's something else than "ignore it, ridicule any question about it and downvote it". Which is what's been happening so far.

@_date: 2014-10-04 21:53:40
Ah. Facts. Got it. 
@_date: 2014-10-06 13:01:36
I don't see anything really bad or false? What exactly is so shit according to you?
@_date: 2014-10-09 10:21:07
Yes. A mod should ban this worthless bot.
It's made by some kid with 2 coins who think we need more discussion so the price will go up. 
@_date: 2014-10-11 10:53:06
The most transactions argument doesn't work.  
If Bitcoin goes mainstream there will be 1000's or maybe 10.000's of transactions a day where a store owner will want 1 confirmation. 1000's of people in all kind of shops waiting 10 mins to a hour for a transaction to go through doesn't work. 
Edit - Can those who downvote me tell at least tell me why and where i'm wrong.
@_date: 2014-10-06 15:02:18
Can you stop spamming already. 
@_date: 2014-10-04 21:57:55
How old are you?
@_date: 2014-10-09 07:14:14
Here we go again. 
@_date: 2014-10-11 05:55:18
Go spread the gospel, son. 
@_date: 2014-10-09 13:07:21
Because at 900 it was also an amazing opportunity. And at 1000. And at 1100. According to the cultists here. 
@_date: 2014-10-04 21:03:07
Because someone on a blog said so. 
@_date: 2014-10-06 20:26:43
What does going into Bitcoin mean?
@_date: 2014-10-04 23:15:05
Funny how YOU are asking if we are mature enough. Something tells me you are not older than 16. 
@_date: 2014-10-11 19:47:46
It's only not important when we're crashing. When we go up it's about the price again. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 19:03:54
Every other post today was how the price doesn't matter?
@_date: 2014-10-05 10:54:10
Can a mod please ban this idiot. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 10:37:22
You are shitting your pants. It's so obvious. 
@_date: 2014-10-06 19:48:03
Yes we know. It was posted 15 times half a week ago. 
@_date: 2014-10-04 18:48:47
This is actually a good thing right? 1 year downtrend and everyone leaving is a good thing. 
Enjoy your worthless cheap coins. I prefer to have expensive coins. 
@_date: 2014-10-04 23:17:59
I have no idea what it will do. That's why i'm not making any claims i pulled out of my ass. 
@_date: 2014-10-04 20:47:32
"Some much needed perspective"
You mean the same shit that is posted every 15 minutes the last few days.  
@_date: 2014-10-11 10:00:17
It's a huge problem in the future. And ignoring it won't get us anywhere. 
But of course if one thing the Bitcoin community is good at it's ignoring fundamental problems. 
@_date: 2014-10-08 01:36:37
Do you realize there are products out there that are worth more than a few 1000? Stop ignoring reality. You want Bitcoin to be used all over the place. That means many store owners are gonna want 1 confirmation. 
It's ridiculous how you just ignore the problem by acting only small transactions will be made.
What is it with you people and the completely denial of any problems Bitcoin might have. 
@_date: 2014-10-06 12:32:22
We've had 30 of these childish posts already hours ago. It's been enough now. Please. 
@_date: 2014-10-09 13:02:39
Ok. Just downvote the fuck out of me for asking a normal question. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 20:17:17
Please just stop posting this. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 14:20:18
They already convinced all their friends and family to invest in this amazing thing that would make them rich. 
All their friends and family lost their money. 
@_date: 2014-10-11 15:19:33
Just go away you fucking retard. 
@_date: 2014-10-09 14:33:48
Thanks. I almost missed it the previous 20 times it was posted. 
@_date: 2014-10-06 20:52:09
Thanks. 
@_date: 2014-10-06 16:31:52
These posts get more pathetic and desperate by the day. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 07:29:32
I think we can do without these kind of topics every 15 minutes. 
@_date: 2014-10-09 07:09:03
If the same defense team as Ross has now would defend a corrupt banker in court you would call them scum and liars. 
But now they defend someone you like so it's all good and they are 100% right without question. 
@_date: 2014-10-04 23:22:38
Serious question. How old are you?
@_date: 2014-10-08 22:40:21
Uh ok. 
@_date: 2014-10-11 10:32:01
So out of arguments? Anything but admitting it's a problem right. 
@_date: 2014-10-12 21:27:21
Freedom fighters. Hilarious. 
@_date: 2014-10-04 22:17:05
So you have no proof? You actually mean just like everyone else you have no idea if we will go up again?
Again, if you have proof to back up your claims please present it. 
@_date: 2014-10-06 16:29:55
You're the 4th person to post this off topic news today. 
@_date: 2014-10-08 01:01:33
Tons of store owners are gonna want 1 confirmation. That's how real life works. No matter how much you think they won't. But just downvote me and the problem will dissapear. 
@_date: 2014-10-04 20:59:45
Are we really gonna get these topics every 15 minutes now?
No. This crash isn't a good thing. No, no and no. 
Stop pretending it is. 
@_date: 2014-10-13 11:51:22
The fact that someone took the time to make that site probably means there are still people who fall for that shit. Sad. 
@_date: 2014-10-11 14:57:22
Hilarious. One of the biggest morons in this sub attacks the other one of the biggest morons. 
@_date: 2014-10-08 22:57:05
Also find the same question when we were at 900. 
@_date: 2014-10-08 09:07:07
Sure, because that's the more likely situation right. 
@_date: 2014-10-11 15:40:16
That is not an answer. That's how Bitcoin works. I know how Bitcoin works. You don't have to explain that me. 
@_date: 2014-10-09 07:06:01
Exactly. It's pathetic. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 09:39:01
You're such a fucking idiot. 
@_date: 2014-10-04 22:08:03
Never go full retard man. 
@_date: 2014-10-08 12:13:16
As long as the bearwhale keeps dumping i don't expect us to go up much more. 
@_date: 2014-10-06 13:41:18
Troll. 
@_date: 2014-10-11 11:48:00
And what would that answer be exactly? I must've missed it. Unless by answer you mean "it's not a problem. Downvoted". Then yes, i've seen it. 
@_date: 2014-10-04 23:20:06
Ah, your crystal ball again. Or are you gonna present some proof to back up your claims this time?
@_date: 2014-10-05 19:43:56
Such an original topic. 
@_date: 2014-10-08 02:00:39
Yes. I do. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 18:04:10
Yeah, haven't seen one of those in the last...10 minutes. 
It's always about the price here but as soon as the market turns to shit the price suddenly doesn't matter anymore. Usually with a few added reasons why this crash is actually good for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-10-06 20:09:56
Stop the reposts man. 
@_date: 2014-10-09 10:50:22
How stupid do you feel right now?
@_date: 2014-10-10 22:54:08
Downvoted but no answer. What a surprise. Bitcoiners and their fantasy land. 
@_date: 2014-10-09 19:47:20
Piss off. 
@_date: 2014-10-07 05:00:42
Wrong sub.
