How do you know your house isn't under surveillence, with people listening in to find out where your gold is stored. Or clues to the password of you vault holding your gold. Our your loved ones schedules so they can hold them hostage while you transfer the gold. Hack the world!

Maybe they are doing the same thing? Either way, not cool that they are not responding. THAT is crap

BEcause you do not own the private key, so you do not own the coins. They can take them, they could go down (like Mt.Gox), they could completely disappear, and you would not know it. Not saying it is going to happen, but it has happened in the past, so better to just have it in a private wallet.

Anyone else think there should be a decent discount for Crypto payments? Maybe I am just bullish on crypto, but if  I got an influx of 80k in crypto, I would hold off until a good run to sell it.

No, your whataboutism isn't needed here. Grandma doesn't know what Bitcoin is, let alone any other altcoins. Hence the overall non-adoption.

In order for crypto to thrive, my 80 year old Grandma has to be able to go on her phone, and send me $10 in bitcoin for my birthday, without it being sent somewhere she didnt want. Saying "if you can't figure it out, dont use it" leaves us in a non-adoption section of history.
