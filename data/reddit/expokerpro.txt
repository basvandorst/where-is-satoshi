Do I need to buy those engraving tools extra?
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:18:59
Do you take donations so we can add to this fund? You are a good guy. Iam just going to mention projects I usually support wikipedia, TOR, and this   this guy builds wells in Africa 
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:21:51
You are wrong, I would say minority are speculating. most of the people are in bitcoin for a long run
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:09:47
Omg I thought he died or something ...  stop scaring me 
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:32:11
I have no other use for this, will the hammer and those letter engravers for 10bucks be good for this?
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:05:00
This is very well done, Good job

If the end up being more rich then zuckerberg that will make a great movie 
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:34:19
I dont quite understand whats the talk about, we are talking about futures there arent going to be any actuall bitcoins being dumped on exchanges. And why in the world would market be following some futres from the first days ???
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:52:42
Did she drop you a lot when you were young with those weak hands?
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:08:17
No its not, Look this is always going to be good investment if bitcoin doesnt fail. Just make sure you price average (do sometime like a 10% of a paycheck or w/e you feel comfy) buy some every 2 weeks or every month. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:02:48
Also if in future you want to sell something like these , where do you go?
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:02:34
More people sell then buy. 
@_date: 2018-09-17 12:16:01
This is just misleading 
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:26:09
holy shit that IAM A SELF MADE MILLIONARE BEFORE BITCOIN. He is a psycho. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:05:57
He got a nice cut out of gox money for this 
@_date: 2018-08-24 11:31:28
As much as thats a good thing. Dont  think even for a second that he hasnt already got more bitcoins that he can spend in his entire life, tucked on side 
@_date: 2018-08-25 10:00:07
Buddy just for your info. that AMA that he did here on reddit was a PR stunt so he can clean a little bit of his name or w/e 
@_date: 2018-08-24 11:13:33
fortunately I had nothing there at the time. But holy cow, making people who already claimed their balances do it again is such a borderline scam.

Can you make money from running lightning node and how hard it is to setup ?
@_date: 2017-03-10 16:05:18
You will learn a hard way probably , but its not wise playing market like that during event like that. In a long run you will lose bunch of money. They might not approve it and price will jump 200$ in a week or they might accept it and price falls to 500$ again. This is bitcoin after all ...
@_date: 2019-03-12 17:31:34
Why not their bitcoin are still worth the same and as soon as they run from Venezuela they have something to work with
@_date: 2017-08-03 13:46:04
this is worse than whole split debacle 
@_date: 2017-08-03 13:44:34
gosh the worst person ever for spreading bitcoin to the world :( 
@_date: 2017-08-07 11:02:30
A lot of it is true and creation of r/btc was acutally good thing in my eyes back then. But how did it turn into toxic gutter like it is now is beyond me... 
@_date: 2017-08-18 16:30:07
wtf is with the "more proffitable to mine" , do you understand how much hash power is behind BTC and how much behind cash ? If even 5% move to cash profitability  will crash rapidly 
@_date: 2018-06-29 12:15:42
Its probably right but every time it takes longer and longer to gather interest so I would quess 100k is going to real maybe somewhere in 2025 to 2030. It will slow down with this huge gains for sure and act much more like the "real" commodities and stocks over the time 
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:46:19
well it was just pure speculations on getting free tokens this is so typical of average bitcoin users though
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:15:43
dont speculate if you believe in bitcoin trust me 90% of my friends who have been in bitcoin at some time got burned heavily because they were trading 
@_date: 2017-11-22 12:42:37
this is so evil roger ver must be supporting it

@_date: 2017-11-30 13:01:41
He absolutely is , he is just smart not talking about it. I would be my right ball that he has 1k BTC stored somewhere. Ofc course He might have spent another 1k+ but he isnt stupid not to keep big stash if he trully believes in bitcoin. And who believes it more then him ? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:09:50
I though they were accepting BTC for  a long time???
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:46:48
exactly . with prices going this quickly up people must have huge% of their net worth in bitcoin and little diversification is never bad, let not pretend it is certain bitcoin is here for ever now and is always gonna make us 100% gain every year.
@_date: 2017-11-18 19:05:08
But he is handsome now not like the crooked fat asshat he was before!

How sweet would it be if that was trezor instead of pen 
@_date: 2017-04-20 20:50:11
Legal as they can now regulate and policy it right? This is kinda double edge sword 
@_date: 2018-02-23 16:12:49
You need to understand its not much of a fun if you are probably rich as hell. He was invested in bitcoin very early. Safe to say he just wanted to do something where there isnt so much pressure 
@_date: 2017-09-08 21:00:15
They clearly dont know much as they couldnt figure out how much decimals bitcoins have. But with their money they clearly just want to invest and dont care about tech that much. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 20:58:51

What were you buying Treska with Rozok in billa :D ?
@_date: 2017-05-18 15:13:59
This is awesome, I live in the country where alza started. And its awesome to see even local companies are starting to implement btc .
I should also mention for those who havent heard of them, They are the biggest online retailer in slovakia and czech republic focused on electronics but also a lots of more and growing their variety of products
@_date: 2017-05-21 23:07:00
look above
@_date: 2017-05-21 23:05:59
Dude just install Bitcoin core (its a wallet in bitcoin.org site) previously known as QT. create a shortcut on your desktop do this  let it sync and you are signaling. easiest thing ever 
@_date: 2017-05-22 21:08:34
she a shill from r/btc or sumthin ?
@_date: 2017-05-23 19:09:23
"My question is can you use that 72 mil in open market ? No .. You have to deal in bit coin currency only . So technically you have money but you can not buy a loaf of bread from it."

yeah 
@_date: 2017-05-17 16:25:31
Oh.. Havent seen they just sold out to evil too, tomorow Iam gonna cancel all my business with them 
@_date: 2017-05-23 19:08:15
" So someone will pay real money for something they can't physically hold? So if someday collectively the whole world chooses not to accept bitcoin as currency then all these people are out millions?" 
People are so smart... This only applies to bitcoin right ?
@_date: 2017-05-22 06:58:22
Nah, you just run bitcoin core wallet and basically run it with comment that you are in support of UASF very easy 
@_date: 2017-05-20 06:57:25
Windows, now I read up and understand that if I install bitcoin core and let it sync and do this  it should be enough to signal UASF for now ? is there anything else I should be doing?
And one more problem can you help me with this :)? While syncing I installed core on my big HD (X:)  but it downloads block to my system (C:)  how do I change this?
@_date: 2017-05-23 19:04:39
" But, they aren't worth anything if no one else but you are buying them."  
But thats the whole point people are buying them thats why they are worth that much ?!?!?!??!??!?
@_date: 2017-05-30 13:09:25
Boy I always though changing POW to something like POS would be terrible idea but boy would that solve a lot of problems. I mean sure rich would have a lot to say but never something crazy like we are facing now as most of the users arent going to buy mining rigs just to show support 
@_date: 2017-05-24 22:44:21
Wrong sub 
@_date: 2017-05-03 16:04:42
You discover everything at the beginning dont you ? 
@_date: 2017-05-24 20:55:45
Smart thing would be to buy 1k$ every week or something like that 
@_date: 2017-05-21 19:07:51
wait did they allow withdrawals already ?
@_date: 2017-05-22 10:53:33
Ty , installed the bip148 enforcing node 
@_date: 2017-05-21 23:19:40
for example my runs like this , X:\Bitcoin\bitcoin-qt.exe -uacomment=UASF-SegWit-BIP148 
and one bonus tip, -datadir=x:/xfolder    add this behind it  and you can change where to download a blockchain since it started downloading it to my system disk and I couldnt figure how to change it. but I did so here it is ! :D
@_date: 2017-05-18 14:01:46
To be honest its probably a good thing that it is not gonna happen. Can you imagine having such a huge market and something bad happenes to bitcoin short term? Poeple who would have money in it trough ETF dont care about technology that much they are just speculating on price.
@_date: 2017-05-23 19:05:42
"You'd be making millions off of sex trafficking and huge amounts in drug sales." 
"Wow, and I could've helped so many pedophiles with those coins. Pass, no matter their worth."
 this seems popular, where is this comming from ?
@_date: 2017-05-09 16:57:49
Are you not worried that what ever you make is slowly getting devalued? You cannot really save that much money these days over 10-20years as they would be worth less and everything would cost more. And once shit hits the fan goverment is just going to take their % no matter where you have them invested.
@_date: 2017-05-20 07:39:46
Ok Fixed it thanks, one more question how do I actually run the BIP148 node once its needed? Iam a bitcoin QT win10 user so I dont know how to compile libraries
@_date: 2017-05-21 23:24:54
my man ! Now go and try to get one other friend who uses btc and is lazy to do anything about this and explain to him how important this is 
@_date: 2017-05-22 21:24:05
I dont see the problem with that 
@_date: 2017-05-24 13:50:57
just for the info, do you not own PC ? seems like a lot of people think they need to buy something special to run node
@_date: 2017-05-21 23:25:58
wow you are not the first person who was under impression that you need alsmot something like minner but cheaper to buy before you can run node. There really should be some PSA about this then 
@_date: 2017-05-21 23:17:05
it probably can be done by typing some very simple command into debug window 
@_date: 2017-05-20 07:41:57
Also how would I check just to be sure that Iam really signaling for BIP148 is there a way? 
@_date: 2017-05-20 17:38:04
I just bought printer from them should arrive in monday. But everything seems just like if I bought with any other payment method 
@_date: 2017-05-22 21:02:33
there will be plenty of time to prepare for this. and if by some miracle not, you will have much bigger problems than worrying about security of your bitcoins 
@_date: 2017-05-31 12:40:04
I send transactions daily and never have I paid more than 50cents and other than one transaction taking 3hours I never had a problem
@_date: 2017-05-21 23:16:24

@_date: 2017-05-19 22:02:33
I was just about to post if there is some guide how to set up USAF node from PC . can some one link it ? 
@_date: 2017-05-15 21:06:53
There must be close to 100% otherwise no one would be paying up 
@_date: 2017-05-21 23:17:50
yeah that part before is default you only add -uacomment=UASF-SegWit-BIP148 behind it 
@_date: 2017-05-23 12:22:38
if drugs fall under purchasing goods that are illegally banned it should be green. Last time (year ago) i saw some statistics and graphs from darkweb it was booming
@_date: 2017-07-11 14:28:14
Is there a way to just install it like I did last UASF core implementation ? I have no idea how to compile libraries like these 
@_date: 2017-05-23 13:11:08
It wasnt like that at all not even that case, and we are talking how viable is buying illegal things with bitcoin not to run a drug empire :D
@_date: 2017-05-22 18:35:41
@_date: 2017-05-30 12:33:17
He has a fair point, a bit utopian perhaps. 
But Iam shocked that most of these people just look at it as investment stock and try to reason why price is up or down. This is not what bitcoin is about, what really drives the price behind is innovation and technology. If he said the crypto as a whole would be worth gazillions then that is very possible and valid statement 
@_date: 2017-05-31 12:34:40
perofitable it might be but not so much profitable
@_date: 2017-07-20 12:35:02
where do i download compiled version for win ?
@_date: 2017-05-31 15:19:17
Oh boy ! finally. To the moon !
@_date: 2017-07-20 22:17:25
Yeah right, he is just taking credit. I would eat my own and mcafes dick if he even grasp basics of what darknet is 
@_date: 2017-05-09 16:53:33
Once china or US starts battling BTC you know we made it. If they start banning BTC like the latin world there is something very wrong with economy. But how would they even go about banning it? Even if they punished people for using it. You can just store them and exchange them for gold or FIAT in other country 
@_date: 2017-07-18 14:35:35
Absolutely until segwit is active there is no reason to do otherwise 
@_date: 2017-05-31 16:49:01
damn almost though it was bitminer 
@_date: 2017-07-18 15:08:54
@_date: 2017-05-23 13:01:26
I never heard about end user getting into problems because police tracked their bitcoins 
@_date: 2017-05-31 16:00:22
time stamp ?
@_date: 2017-05-31 22:24:35
??? the heck , people had their BTC stuck on exchange how is that not awesome for them?
@_date: 2019-05-22 16:22:25
What happens if country get hold by a dictator ? Also those people are mostly put in their place by same person (prime minister) also why would you put pope in there :D
@_date: 2019-05-16 12:37:32
does this work for amazon.com or EU versions too ?
@_date: 2017-06-06 22:13:40
its never too late, even if coin is fairly stagnant at around 10k$+ it still would be better to buy btc instead holding FIAT 
@_date: 2017-06-05 16:20:17
I dont want to spread fud , but how come people are still buying heavily even though we might be facing one of the biggest challenges of bitcoin history. Are most of the new investors uninformed with whats about to happen and how much of a price swing it might bring with it ?
@_date: 2019-05-22 13:57:23
As much as I would love something like this happen. I think holding BTC as country at this stage is utterly stupid. Especially in country like bulgaria. It would be stolen by someone from inside
@_date: 2017-06-05 16:21:09
on a 2nd though this may be just people who were waiting for the exchanges verification backlog.
@_date: 2019-05-16 12:35:15


does this work for amazon.de too ?
@_date: 2017-06-16 14:05:02
A lot of people seems to think this sub is against block increase and I dont think this is true at all, I for one would welcome some increase if its well though out and all parties would accept it. I dont see why we shouldnt try segwit and block increase. Segwit is going to take some time to give us scaling but it will give us more at the end than any raise of block size will, so until then we can have 2MB or 4MB blocks to help out 
@_date: 2017-06-13 18:48:26
Well arent we in this for the most part for the same reason? And even if that wasnt true of course it matter, their style is very trolly and meme based and that attracts a lot users. Look what happened with the_donald and the US elections 
@_date: 2017-06-12 11:47:09
this is like the theme on /btc , once eth has bigger market cap than btc. bitcoin is done forever nobody is ever going to buy or use it ! Who would have though that so little was needed to bring down BTC :D 
@_date: 2017-06-21 07:17:54
Oh sorry my bad :)
@_date: 2017-06-18 12:06:39
When does segwit2x activate the SW it self ?
@_date: 2017-06-05 16:27:43
I get all of that but the part "buy as much now" thats just gambling I mean unless USAF pushes miners into accepting segwit before august its very good chance price will drop hard in the chaos of the first weeks. Wouldnt it be much smarter move to sit this one out and wait whats gonna happen and then invest? (as a new investor of course) 
@_date: 2017-06-18 09:51:16
good lord are they going full on trump and dont care how ridiculous they sound ?
@_date: 2017-06-07 12:24:47
do you need ID to sell buy live handing out cash for btc ?
@_date: 2017-06-05 21:53:12
oh no .com crash ?
@_date: 2017-06-14 13:15:10
well jihan is the problem why bitcoin is not that great at this moment so ?
@_date: 2017-06-21 07:18:13
Oh sorry my bad 
@_date: 2017-06-20 22:07:36
More like how do you not sell after you get like 100k that must be like all the momey in the world for teen 
@_date: 2017-06-14 14:27:27
I have no problem with ETH being n1... So what? But then again why are you hyping smart contract token to be worth 1000 of dollars?
