Yeah, HAS to be a password issue. I'm guessing you have special characters in there? Are you sure the keyboard layout hasn't changed? E.g. UK to USA layout changes @ to " etc.

Product placed!  
This is exciting, we've been thinking about scaling up our home brewing process, so now is my chance to find out if others like our beer!  If it turns out that people like it, it would be good motivation to move towards going pro!
More realistically though, it's great to think that someone other than friends or family might taste and review my beer!

I'm interested in 2 or 3, maybe 4. I'm in UK.
Usual question - how do we know we can trust you?  Any sort of escrow service offered?

That's a great idea to speak to Trezor, I love their hardware idea.

How many coins have been paid for now?  I am definitely interested, but would me much happier to send payment once others have confirmed receipt (which sounds like it should be any day).

To add to that list, as a seller, I didn't see an obvious link to edit my listings.  The only method I found was to go to "Submti new product" and then access the "Products" link from there.  It would be good to have direct access to the " link from the Sell or My Account page.

Let it be me!

I've thought it over in the past few days and decided that I'll pass for now. Thanks for offering to reserve/pay for the coins, I appreciate it, but I'm pretty hard to separate from my bitcoins...I've had them for a long time. 
I might be up for another group deal when there is more evidence/proof that everything is legit.  Again, it's not that I don't trust you specifically (you seem nice and genuine), I just like to be cautious.

I own bitcoinsafe.net, bought it for a project that I didn't have time to go through with.  I might still pick the project up, but would also consider selling if interested (or better yet, collaborating in some way.)
