The Binance owners will benefit most from this move. By getting over with the coin burn quickly, all of Binance's future profit will go to its owners again. Currently, 20% go to the tokenholders each quarter. And that would have probably been much more in the years to come than if they finish the coin burn here and now by burning their own tokens.

New tether tokens are created when mlre people sell crypto for a safe heaven stable coin.

True. But it was a huge gamble and not responsible investing. If Bitcoin would have disappeared, they could have gone financially broke. Is that something you would like to risk?
How frustrating would it be if crypto becomes a huge success but you just bought the one coin that went south?
Yes, diversification might lead to lower returns overall, but also reduces your financial risk significantly. One has to ask: do you want to gamble or do you want to invest?
@_date: 2018-10-03 01:25:50
Maybe neither nor. It seems after years of high volatility, bitcoin has finally found its equilibrium / stable coin price at around usd 6.5k.
@_date: 2018-10-25 00:05:32
They used usd 500 million in cash frok their bank account to repurchase 500 million tether that got burned after. Due to the 1 to1 backing, it is always a zero sum game. In fact, they might have made some profit since they should have been able to buy below usd 1.
Maybe that is also the reason why tether has no incentive to get properly audited: if tether crashes in between, they can repurchase cheap tether which had previously been sold at usd 1 or above.

It will definitely be interesting to see how this plays out and it can't hurt to keep a few BTCs on the sideline in order to enjoy the ride.

The hodl mentality was invented by a philosopher on the bitcointalk forum many years back. No dark forces involved here. It is an ancient theory but it worked well during bull markets. Of course it does not work in bear markets.

Although first media report call for the USD 0 price target such as German business magazine Handelsblatt, it is rather unlikely from my point of view that we really hit 0 unless there is major flaw detected in the Bitcoin protocol itself.
The reason is that there is a hardcore Bitcoin community which would buy Bitcoin if it falls below usd 100. Latest by then, buyers should be back on the stage.
@_date: 2018-11-17 14:16:56
Bitcoin would have been much better indeed but also bitcoin has a crazy inflation rate. Beginning of this year, 1 btc was worth an equivalent of roughly 19k usd. 1 year later, you can buy less for a btc and would only get about usd 5.5k. Still better but also not very encouraging.
@_date: 2018-03-26 05:29:00
It is crypto winter and interest in crypto is declining rapidly. One day things will change again, but not this year anymore.
@_date: 2018-11-17 14:51:19
With the falling prices, mining becomes less profitable or even loss making, so no more computer power is added. But the system can be easily maintained with the current hash rate.

I am talking in usd terms. At the end of the day, a lot of things still need to be bought with fiat mate.

It seems that crypto is currently in terminal decline. It unfortunately never got adopted in real life use cases and the linkedin article describes the reasons quite well. Just like paper cheques, it might be disappearing again. Thanks for sharing the article.
@_date: 2018-11-06 03:14:56
The way crypto works is: if btc goes up, everything follows, if btc crashes, everything crashes. It really does not matter what you buy.
@_date: 2018-11-25 13:35:21
Of course not in the technical sense mate, but in terms of price predictions.
@_date: 2018-03-30 01:40:05
We are currently in the middle of a long and extended crypto winter. Cryptocurrency experts expect a reversal to happen not before we see prices of below usd 1000. Key reversal area might be around usd 100.
@_date: 2019-01-10 07:06:59
Oh my god. First huge crash in 2019. The bear market is back again.
@_date: 2018-03-29 05:37:11
Interest in crypto is currently rapidly declining and sone commentators even speak of terminal decline. In this environment, a recovery is highly unlikely, let alone until june. The question is just on what level we can stabilize. Some cryptocurrency experts predict that we could find a bottom in the usd 100 to usd 1000 region.
@_date: 2018-03-29 00:10:43
That is very dangerous because next time you look it might be worth much less. According to cryptocurrency experts, we are just at the start of a long crypto winter, and interest in cryptocurrency is rapidly declining. Some estimates ranged from lows of usd 1000 or usd 100 even. So better take a close look and stay actively involved before you are suddenly very disappointed.
@_date: 2018-03-28 01:39:50
Cryptocurrency experts predict that we are just at the very beginning of a long and extended bear market and btc low might be somewhere between usd 100 and usd 1000. So you should wait with buying. Moreover, interest in cryptocurrency is rapidly declining currently and some even speak of terminal decline.
@_date: 2018-03-30 05:44:43
Well written and i agree the idea is great. But i am not sure anymore if we will see adoption because the trend is going in the opposite direction and adoption is shrinking. Btc and crypto would have been a perfect payment method for internet shops to begin with. It would only have taken a big player like amazon to lead by examples and many would have followed. But it just didnt happen.

The newest report of the cryptocurrency experts at JP Morgan investment bank has caused quite a market slide. It seems the stream of bad news is never ending in this bear market.

Omg 21 bitcoins is quite a thing. Congratulations and welcome to the 1 million club. There will never be more than 1 million people owning more than 21 btc.

We are now in crypto winter, which can be cold and desperate. Interest in crypto is strongly declining and some speak of terminal decline. There is still hope though that one day - maybe years from now - we will see better days again. Hodl strong.
@_date: 2018-03-26 05:23:56
The bear market just started. It wont end before 2019 but could extend even further. Interest in crypto is currently declining and adoption unfortunately still not happening.
@_date: 2019-01-13 04:02:37
Binance. Just send some ether in and buy btc, then withdraw. No verification needed up to two btc.
@_date: 2018-03-30 03:10:33
Thats the problem. You cant value bitcoin like a company. Its inherent value is 0. However, it can still have value if it is largely used and adopted. We now had the third bubble with a lot of public interest but thete is still little to no adoption. Even worse, adoption is shrinking (just look at reddit or steam who have dropped btc). Without adoption, it is just a super risky speculative frenzy. I fear we need to conclude that btc has failed because it never managed to get the adoption it needed. The idea was brillant though.
@_date: 2018-11-15 05:33:23
It is really sad. Crypto was such a nice and promising idea. But it never found the adoption that would have been necessary. Despite having lost some money, i dont really regret having invested. From last years perspective, there seemed to be a high risk/reward ratio.
@_date: 2018-11-25 05:23:38
It hurts. Cryptocurrency expert warren buffet was one of the only ones predicting this... and man, we should have listened.
@_date: 2018-03-24 12:34:20
It is crypto winter and interest in blockchain technology is currently decreasing. The transaction count going down is the natural result.
@_date: 2019-01-30 00:39:00
Nice one mate. Good start for your very first meme.
@_date: 2018-03-29 11:45:46
Cryptocurrency experts expect a rebound only once we hit the usd 100 to usd 1000 range. Save your cash for a while.
@_date: 2018-03-29 08:12:17
No worries most cryptocurrency experts expect a recovery once we have bottomed in the usd 100 to usd 1000 range. Better days will come but at the moment we are in the middle of a long crypto winter.
@_date: 2019-09-29 14:02:04
Yes, it looks very bad and hopeless.
@_date: 2019-09-24 16:06:33
It shows that institutional interest in Bitcoin is not really there.
In any case, 10 BTC of trading volume added per day is at least something.

So sorry for your typo, but it happens mate. I also lost some coins before and it sucks.
You still got some satoshis on that address and you can opt to just buy another bitcoin to fill it up again.

@_date: 2018-03-29 13:35:57
Btc is still king, so altcoins would be more or less worthless and return to their old levels - i guess ltc was around usd 2 when btc was at usd 100.
@_date: 2019-09-03 00:19:05
Bitmex seems to be the only cause that can move the markets these days.
Great upward move, but based on experience, next turn is for the longs to get liquidated again.

These Quantum computers indeed pose a huge risk.
However, if I understand it correctly, it could easily take another year or two until quantum computers are fully market ready and are shipped out in huge quantities. Hence, there is still a little time to think of possible solutions.

It rather looks like 10k was the next euphoria and we are now once again entering a new bear market.
I just saw that Tether climbed to  on Coinmarketcap and might sooner or later become the largest crypto. Maybe the future rather belongs to stable coins?

2018 is over. We are currently in a massive bear market cycle and in crypto winter as some call it. But cryptocurrency experts also believe that we should stabilize in the region slightly below usd 1,000 and 2019 could get better again.

It is called george soros first trade. Maybe also some russians who try to save their money from the crashing rubel.

Since btc will increase in value forever, you have an incentive to convert all your fiat to crypto. But since you also need to pay bills, you are forced to do in btc because you have no fiat left.

Most cryptocurrency experts have said that the all time high was reached in january and now we will go down massively. However i also read that these experts expect a bottom and stabilization around usd 1000 so there might be hope for next year.
@_date: 2018-04-06 11:18:04
2018 is just a bear market year. Cryptocurrency experts expect that prices will stabilize in the usd 1000 region or slightly below.

Only buy from official ledger site. Never from third party vendors. It is not worth the risk.

@_date: 2019-05-19 03:08:11
Fully agree. Time is the most precious resource.
My goal independant of bitcoin is to grow my passive income (dividend, interest etc.) in order to work less and free up time.
More time for family, myself, travel etc. That would be really cool.

Nowhere does it say that the funds are held as bitcoin. It says that 10% of the trading fees will be allocated to the fund, and trading fees are usually collected in bnb. Whether they do some diversification is not clear.
The sharp drop in bnb price correlates with the rise in bitcoin. Well possible that binance needs to sell bnb for bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-08 00:18:25
This will cause a massive crypto crash unless law enforcement is acting fast.
What a sad day for crypto and for binance.
@_date: 2019-05-09 23:41:24
Binance needs to massively sell altcoins / bnb in their safu fund in order to recover lost bitcoins.
@_date: 2019-05-12 03:25:59
Just a chain of events that was initiated by the binance hack:
Binance hack -&gt; binance forced to buy back 7000 btc in a short time from altcoins and bnb in safu fund -&gt; btc shooting up this one day while all alts down -&gt; now shorters were surprised and a short squeeze happened, all in an illiquid weekend market.
@_date: 2019-05-08 00:20:57
My god, what a disaster. With 7000 btc flooding the markets with market sell orders, this will cause a massive crash. Here goes our small recovery.
