We’re at about 21,000,000 TH/s, so you’d need to add about 21,860,000 to control 51%. But keep in mind that historically this number increases by a factor of 6 every year.

The thing is, the stock market is also in a fairly substantial bubble. Now maybe these stocks have more intrinsic value than bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, but that doesn’t safeguard someone from losing a lot of money in it—especially when that someone doesn’t know what they are doing.

The problem with antminers is that, given the current exponential growth of the hashing power, each antminer will, at most, give you about 0.45 bitcoin over its lifetime, 75% of which would come in the first year. But after the first year, you'll be expending energy for diminishing returns, so in many locations it wouldn't make sense to keep it running. You'll need to upgrade to continue making a profit. 
Mining is a bad idea for people who think they can just plug it in and forget about it. To actually make money, it needs to be actively managed like a full-time business.
EDIT: Anyone paying $5000 for an antminer is a fool.

This isn't true. Debt and inflation can be healthy and are absolutely necessary for economic growth. Look, I'm all for Bitcoin. As a store of value, it's a fantastic concept and the technology is revolutionary. But let's not kid ourselves here--a society where bitcoin completely replaces currency would be a dystopian future marked by prolific economic decline. Whether or not you like it, the Fed and financial institutions have their place and will continue to alongside cryptocurrencies in the future.

Intrinsic properties alone, Bitcoin is absurdly overvalued at the moment. The tech can barely keep up with demand, which is why you see skyrocketing transaction fees and backlogged transactions. I wouldn't buy in at this price personally. Now, it's possible in the next year or so that the lightning network may solve a lot of these problems, but since we don't know yet, it's all speculation. We're speculating that bitcoin will become something bigger than its capable of being at the current moment.

People, let’s be honest. As much as I like bitcoin, it is extremely far from being at the level where it can replace fiat or banks for that matter, and anyone who says otherwise is delusional. That day may come years or decades from now, but only after all the serious technical problems get sorted out.

Which is why BTC should only be used for larger transactions, and leave the everyday stuff like coffee and food to something with faster transaction times, like Ripple. I just don’t see bitcoin reaching widespread adoption for small transactions because it takes too long to confirm and the fees are too high. It does make sense as a sort of savings account reserved for big purchases.

The general consensus here is to not store any large sum of money on an exchange.

My guess is that digital assets would be covered by Gemini in the event of a hack since it would be in their best interest to not have their customers lose money. Still, the FDIC insurance adds to the credibility of Gemini as a relatively safe place to store funds. OP should make sure to use 2FA.

Coinbase and GDAX are the same organization. Coinbase has added simplicity which might be nice for someone just getting started into the scene, which they charge a premium for, ie higher fees. When I️ buy a coin on Coinbase, I️ know it will fill. On GDAX, I️ can set buy/sell limits, where my order might not fill depending on what I️ ask for the coin and what the market price is. Generally, there’s a few more bells and whistles with GDAX that might confuse newcomers, so Coinbase is a sort of simplified counterpart to GDAX.

It would imply economic collapse which would be bad for all of us, even if we have plenty of bitcoin. Those of us that managed to escape the impending rioting, looting, and civil war would watch the world tear itself apart. People would become vengeful of the hodlers. Everyone on this subreddit would have to go to great lengths to establish new identities. Perhaps there would be some sort of crypto haven that we would migrate to and avoid persecution.

If we assume the Fed's target inflation rate of 2.5% will hold for the next 11 years, then `(1/1.025)^11 * 1,000,000 = $762,144.78`.
However, the target inflation rate cited in the news is the CPI (consumer price index), and only accounts for goods and services, like food, gas, electricity, etc, and not asset prices [1]. Between 2008 and 2018, we saw a record-breaking growth in home prices and stocks, fueled by extremely low interest rates and quantitative easing. Therefore, even if the CPI inflation rate remains modest, buying power of the USD may fall at a rate much higher than 2.5% when compared against assets like stocks, bonds, or ~~real estate~~, which feels an awful lot like inflation, even if it they don't call it inflation.

Thanks for these comments, they're really good points and well thought out.
In terms of fiat money into Bitcoin, couldn't you estimate that through the cost of mining Bitcoin and the available hashing power? There are 1800 new Bitcoins minted per day. The market needs to absorb that cost somehow, otherwise, wouldn't you see a drop in price? 
And going to your earlier statement, 1M USD / Bitcoin seems outlandish, but it's going to depend entirely on how much people end up using it in the future. If layering on top of Bitcoin with networks like Lightening are successful, it's entirely possible that a whole new ecosystem could be built on top of Bitcoin. A successful Bitcoin would look very different than today from the end-user's perspective. In fact, they may not even notice that the financial system running off Bitcoin in the background. 
That being said, it's a major speculation. It could entirely become worthless. I think a lot will depend on:
1. How successful the layer scaling is with handling transactions and reducing costs of the traditional financial system
2. To what extent any major economic crises occur that can be attributed to the current financial system
3. To what extent other countries adopt Bitcoin in an attempt to side-step the USD or whichever currency is currently dominant at the time.
4. Assuming that Bitcoin remains secure and unhackable.

Those are fair points. I concede the debate to you.
But I have something to add. While CPI accounts for housing, can it be broken down by region or metropolitan area? One could surmise that the CPI may be higher in economic hubs, such as the Bay Area, New York, Chicago, Austin, etc. 
If the amount of money flowing into the area was greater than the amount of goods and services available, then you would in theory prices would rise faster than neighboring states without economic hubs.

Oh no need to apologize; you're right about it being for non-tech savvy people. The fees alone are pretty outrageous. But it helped me get introduced to the scene, and I was able to learn about how it all worked in the process. Now I use GDAX if I want to make a trade. Way cheaper, but a little more tricky. For the average user who doesn't take the time to learn about cryptocurrencies but still wants to be involved with the investment opportunity, I think leaving money in Coinbase is a reasonably safe measure.

You guys do realize that if inflation didn’t exist then the rich could just sit on their wealth and do nothing, right? And that economic progress would slow because it would make more sense to save rather than spend?  And that there would be substantially less job opportunities available because of the above points? There is a reason why inflation exists and if you guys are going to be making statements about it, you should at least take some time to learn about.

A lot of people echo similar sentiments, only to find themselves clawing on to any source of hope when their time comes. Why? Maybe to they want to live long enough to see their kids graduate high school, or get married, etc. Hospitals know this and that’s why they offer all of the extensive treatment options that may or may not prolong life by a few weeks or months—ultimately it’s a business and they’re in it to make money. If you have insurance, you probably won’t break the bank. But it’s these end of life treatments, some of which costing upwards of a million dollars per patient, that are sinking the health insurance markets and making health insurance unaffordable to the rest of us. Perhaps if we are to ameliorate the current implosion in healthcare, we should start by pushing hospice over needless surgeries and lengthy hospital stays that only prolong the inevitable.
