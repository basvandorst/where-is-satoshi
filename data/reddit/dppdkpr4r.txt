80k by mid 2019 before it crashes to 25k in last quarter , which is what it'll be stable at throughout 2019.

Asian markets have been at the forefront of when it comes to adopting Bitcoin as investments. So you saying that this surge us because European/asianarkets just got active is wrong. Surge primarily seems to be a result of big guns opting this as an investment option and that's primarily west

As long as you file your profits as income and pay taxes, no one will bother you. Arbitrage is legal.

If that happens, then yes it will. Because price is dictated by the balance of demand and supply. This is why some are worried that BTC futures will cause a short-term fall and why this sudden rise in BTC cost just before futures is a bit fishy.

If you do do this and amount is high then please go over to and ask for advice regarding that. I am not sure if there are any limits on this kind of transfer in your country/state and what amount will raise a red flag.

I don't even regret not buying some myself as I have been following crypto since wikileaks started accepting it as donations, that was 2011. 
 
I never had the money to take risk with, so I didn't. I still buy conservatively.

Market Cap and total worth of all bitcoins mined isn't the same thing.

Many suspect it's a bubble like when BTC rocketed to 1k. Others think it's because of widespread interest. 
Many of sudden jumps in 2016 can be attributed to geopolitical uncertanies that usually weaken the currencies of countries involved. When the uncertainty looms, people usually take out parts of their investments in stocks/fiat and invest in Gold (as gold is far more stable than fiat)
Bitcoin is currently being called Gold 2.0, most media outlets picked up on this in Sept-oct and are still going gaga over BTC. The returns that it offers currently are unreal and has skyrocketed not just the price but also the interest. 
On the other hand fund managers and traders have also gotten interested in BTC. A couple of countries after going through massive deflation of currency have also turned towards Crypto/BTC , like Venezuela , Argentina, Brazil etc. 
There probably are other factors too but Bitcoin is gaining traction because of what it was always meant to be, a decentralized currency. The fact that stocks and wars don't affect BTC is why many people get drawn towards it in times of geopolitical uncertanities. 
This all is obviously a speculation. If it's a bubble or sustainable gain is something only time will tell.
FOrgot to add, the recent surge can be attributed to BTC Futures that goes active on Dec. 10.

If you have someone in Europe you can trust then you can make some quick bucks. It's called arbitrage. Buy low in USD, transfer, sell high in EUR. Transfer money to a/c in USA and repeat.
But your volume needs to be high enough that you'll make decent money after all the fees.
