Can you imagine unaccounted wars if fiat was accounted for?  Blockchain promised such accountability.
But you are absolutely right about bigger problems in case of recession!
Sad but happens in cycles and those who work hard are the ones tested the most during recession.
@_date: 2019-07-27 01:29:24
Yes you are right .9% of 1%
@_date: 2019-07-19 22:52:08
Great elaborate response
Thank you!
@_date: 2019-07-19 21:36:08
Interesting thing is instead of focusing on enabling Blockchain Tech to be world leaders, they are playing these Scary tactics to punish early adopters and trailblazers!
As Trump would say it “SAD”
@_date: 2019-07-19 22:52:44
And are we to assume Govt to stick with those laws?
Do they?
@_date: 2019-07-19 21:45:43
They say "subjects" but how do you know the "subjects" without first intruding?  If you are intruding, you are automatically violating the constitution rights?  Seems like a catch 22...
@_date: 2019-07-27 01:30:39
That is a valid view point and at this point everyone is throwing dart in the dark
@_date: 2019-07-26 12:57:55
That is the rub here - ppl have someone to blame with fiat...(indirectly themselves) with bitcoin - there is no one to blame!

Oh :(
@_date: 2018-10-10 06:04:58
Thank you..personally - we like Propy (although not invested) - that's taking a whole industry to blockchain...we also like Berkeley CAs move to raise its own funds that most people have not taken note of...of course, most people take time to give us negative feedback forgetting the work that goes into these...but that's ok - once in a while - we get feedback like yours and that keeps us going - we appreciate your response very much!

True bitcoiner!  Mass adoption happens with awareness and awareness comes from daily usage!
@_date: 2018-10-10 02:11:06
So sorry you feel that way - probably you are one of those TA guys!?
@_date: 2018-10-10 06:01:40
those who only rely on TA movements rather than these general news updates?!
@_date: 2018-10-10 06:06:13
We only see feed to the channels we are subscribed to...we did not want other channels to miss - because this is relevant for whole crypto market rather than one sub or other! but we get your sentiment...and appreciate it!
@_date: 2019-08-12 14:39:49
Agree although I cannot sing in a chorus
@_date: 2018-06-27 15:19:29
Absolutely valid points...but if you read the whole article, it does say "not the existing form of Govt", we don't need that; "Government on the blockchain" is the form that we need...
Great contribution to the thread/good point 1 and 3...
@_date: 2019-08-08 18:03:14
Thats why they make us use Credit Card - so ppl dont feel it that physical way
@_date: 2019-10-15 18:40:36
Predictable 
They will launch their project no matter what Governments do

Are you saying it will be much more massive than that?
@_date: 2019-10-17 21:18:03
Makes sense
@_date: 2019-08-12 17:02:09
Interesting observation

Even when you hold the tokens in US accounts - if they are eventually 'characterized' as securities by SEC (or other agencies) - then you may have Form 8938 filing under FATCA (because they talk about: 
* Stock or securities issued by someone other than a U.S. person
* Any interest in a foreign entity, and 
* Any financial instrument or contract that has as an issuer or counterparty that is other than a U.S. person.
In a stricter sense, if cryptocurrencies are considered securities then they will hit more than one of the above definitions that need Form 8938 even when they are held in personal wallets (like Myetherwallet or Trezor)...of course - the rules are out there - interpretations (by authorities or CPAs) are not conclusive!
@_date: 2018-11-28 10:17:10
Yes - Bitcoin and Ethereum are safely out of these regimes as long as held in personal wallets and/or US based accounts!
@_date: 2018-03-18 12:39:18
Would have been true if not for:
Poloniex bought by Goldman
Consensus meeting in May with 4500 people in attendance
Joint Economic Report recommending collaboration of Govt's in blockchain
These will create major bull run in matter of months instead of years! IMO

They are betting on stupid outdated college courses that dont get translated to real world anyway, why not diversify early?!

[what will bitcoin do in a recession](
@_date: 2019-09-15 21:23:48
A bit more balanced view: 
@_date: 2019-09-16 17:22:58
Very good point and unique pov
@_date: 2019-09-10 15:10:02
Bull shit never seems to end!
@_date: 2019-09-05 19:59:53
Lets see
I personally dont like facebook but they have best lobbyists
@_date: 2019-09-16 13:28:14
Fair point.
The last paragraph does give the possible outcome:
“In our opinion, even with a temporary dump of bitcoin in the event of a recession, things should bounce back quickly to help bitcoin find its ground and get back on its uptrend.”
 but your point is still fair!  Thank you...
@_date: 2018-04-24 03:28:16
40% is owned by handful anonymous ppl - instead of govt and that is some how better?
I definitely dig the store of value off bitcoin though!
