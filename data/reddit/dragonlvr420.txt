he’s just saying there doesn’t *have* to be a break out anytime soon, as in it’s not the rule 
@_date: 2018-05-12 01:42:53
rough day, huh 
@_date: 2018-05-25 21:35:25
you may think they’re idiots, but bitcoin and crypto as a whole needs those idiots to get to the point the people in this sub are expecting it to 
@_date: 2018-05-23 03:20:24
@_date: 2018-05-27 13:32:08
and some point it will get there. But for now, public interest-&gt;adoption-&gt;wide spread usage. It still needs the popularity to get to that point 
@_date: 2018-05-18 18:26:53
try asking this is r/bitcoinmarkets too, you might get more responses. their daily discussion has a lot more traffic 
@_date: 2018-05-03 14:34:10
wooot, it’s happeningg
@_date: 2018-05-01 16:29:23
well, we did finally break out.. 
@_date: 2018-05-25 13:41:14
last chance to buy under 8k!!!!! lol 
@_date: 2018-05-26 21:56:35
especially when you still need to work for fiat to buy crypto with at this point lol 
@_date: 2018-05-26 19:56:30
he has freed himself of being a slave to the smoke detector and it’s whims 
@_date: 2018-05-20 14:12:29
yeah, we’ll see a massive volume increase once it breaks out but no one seems to want to take the plunge first 
@_date: 2018-05-01 00:42:41
the two couldn’t possibly be related, could they?

volume on GDAX is saaaaaad, never seen it this low before

damn, he’s really packing it on lol 
@_date: 2018-05-08 18:01:09
McAfee will literally tweet about any coin as long as he’s paid enough. I have no faith that that bet was serious, but I’d love to see the loon eat his own dick either way.

@_date: 2018-05-09 00:57:41
what’d he do this time 
@_date: 2018-05-27 12:15:51
not exactly comparable. none of those things need wide-spread public interest and participation to evolve and progress anymore, bitcoin does. 
@_date: 2018-05-27 13:28:10
and if only arguments could be decided by nitpicking sentence formatting decisions 
@_date: 2018-05-05 11:28:53
today is the dayy
@_date: 2018-05-27 12:58:58
lmao again, not comparable. People don’t need to understand the oil extraction process to understand the value of oil. The wide array of practical uses is what makes it so valuable.

@_date: 2018-05-28 21:06:48
look what you’ve done 
@_date: 2018-05-08 12:19:49
lol got so close to 10k and now we might be heading right back to 8.8k 3 days later, sighh. here’s to hoping this week is better

@_date: 2018-05-06 10:49:49
lmaoo someone’s cranky today 
@_date: 2018-05-27 13:03:32
yes, because it has practical uses to back up the value. still not comparable, which was my point. 
@_date: 2018-05-05 21:55:46
@_date: 2018-05-03 21:13:09
I’ve been holding my breath all day waiting for a drop but it seems I can let it go for now 
@_date: 2018-05-27 13:29:39
so, “not comparable” isn’t a way to describe a false equivalency? 
@_date: 2018-05-11 17:24:30
I keep checking back but apparently yes, we’re just going to pretend today didn’t happen 
@_date: 2018-06-10 17:54:06
at least volume is up amirite 
@_date: 2018-06-08 12:13:31
McAfee is a loon, paid shill, drug addict, and possible murderer. Have you ever actually done any research on him other than these interviews? He is not someone you should want as a spokesperson for anything lol 
@_date: 2018-06-22 02:15:09
obviously 
@_date: 2018-06-08 13:25:22
whether you believe it or not does not negate the fact that having this guy as the “face” of crypto is a bad look, especially when he’s pulling shit like this.  
@_date: 2018-06-22 14:11:03
I’m holding too but my point still stands that the logic is unsound, it’s mooned once under mysterious circumstances opposed to all the “dips” lol 
@_date: 2018-06-21 00:34:45

Hypothetically, how would you all feel if bitcoin never went over 10k again, and be honest. Not trying to spread FUD as I don’t think this will happen but I’m just curious of the mindset here
@_date: 2018-03-29 20:12:06

or you could just, you know, ignore it 
@_date: 2018-03-30 15:28:32
yep, the FOMO money is what pushed it up this high in the first place. Once that’s gone, bitcoin could stabilize but it won’t be shooting up again till more FOMO comes in, and no one knows when that could be or why 
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:57:20
^this is truly a sign of the bitpocalypse

but they’re *magic beans*, how could you not 
@_date: 2018-02-11 20:00:56
Well for one, anyone who would watch this(if anyone even did) would already be into crypto so I can’t see it bringing in any new investors. 
Which brings us to my second point, who the fuck would watch an award show for investors? 
And who would these “Stars” in this star-studded event be? How does one become a celebrity crypto investor? 
What would the award categories be?
Would you be paying all the people involved in planning and setting the event up with crypto or fiat? 
Just a crappy idea dude lol 
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:35:51
that’s kind of my point, it’s the first. It will just continue to be improved upon until it’s obsolete when there’s another, “easier to use” coin available. That’s how the tech world works. And being known around the world isn’t a trait that only bitcoin could have

I could easily say blindly optimistic posts are useless for the exact same reason then, right? Are you not just coming here to say that it’s going up when it’s going up? lol that’s what discussion is, or is it just because you don’t like it? 
@_date: 2018-03-27 20:27:49

@_date: 2018-03-30 16:25:13
not meant to be FUD: crypto is the future, but who’s to say bitcoin will be the one to “break out”? You all like to say that one day the whole world will be using BTC, but blockchain is still new. There will no doubt be newer, better coins created in the coming years. Bitcoin might not even be in the top 5 in a few years. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 02:37:30

@_date: 2018-03-17 15:18:30
I think it will pass 10k again but not for long or not that much higher if it does. I just see a lot of people saying that they’re in it for the tech which I can understand, but they also seem to care a lot about the fiat value so I’m curious how they’d react. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 03:30:47
yep, when given a choice between fiat and crypto, the average person would always choose fiat. Most people just don’t care, it only matters how simple it is to use. I really can’t see crypto being widely adopted by the public as a currency anytime soon
@_date: 2018-03-06 11:38:17
fall asleep at 11.5k, wake up to 10.8k &gt;.&gt;
@_date: 2018-03-29 18:14:57
Why would it ever be manipulated that high when consistent profits can be made in this range? The people manipulating the market have no need for it to ever reach even $20k again 
@_date: 2018-03-30 11:48:18
oh man that made me sad, I hope that guy posts again lol
@_date: 2018-02-27 23:29:40
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:44:11
It just doesn’t make sense man, especially paying for it all in crypto. 
You know you’d have to pay these celebrities a lot of money for them to even bother showing up, and they wouldn’t accept crypto as payment. 
What channels would air the show? The studios also wouldn’t accept crypto. 
You’d need a TON of advertising to get even the bare minimum amount of viewers, again, not attainable with crypto. 
You can’t reserve a location for the event with crypto. 
Most workers in the production/broadcasting and event planning crews will not want to be paid in crypto either, considering they are working for a regular income to support their families and not investment opportunities. 
Where would you get this massive amount of cash? 
@_date: 2018-03-29 17:40:09
steady 10k seems like a distant memory now 
@_date: 2018-03-30 13:25:02

@_date: 2018-04-26 16:10:56
I was more responding to his “good sign for adoption” argument. I agree on them making short sighted investments, but the general public won’t forget that and won’t see it the same way. And we need that money to reach those highs again and to encourage more adoption
@_date: 2018-04-17 23:36:38
obviously I meant in the sub lol 
@_date: 2018-04-18 14:41:02

I want that to happen as much as the next guy but this year isn’t last year, no one knows what will happen and if recent trends have signaled anything, it’s not going to go exactly the same way it went last year. I don’t think this run is going to 20k, but it’s definitely a good start and a sign of good things to come
@_date: 2018-04-18 20:41:03
now that you have that all figured out, mind if I borrow your time machine for a sec?
@_date: 2018-04-04 20:39:04
do you have any tin foil I could borrow by any chance? 
@_date: 2018-04-26 12:30:40
what about the rest of the east coast ): lol 
@_date: 2018-04-28 18:44:01
so what are you all expecting to happen next week? 
@_date: 2018-04-05 14:32:32
let’s hope it lasts lol

the “$1200 last year” argument is getting kind of old. at this point it’s more of a reminder of how much is left to lose than anything else. 
I believe in bitcoin and I’m not going anywhere any time soon, but those huge jumps in such a short period of time is exactly why we’re in this slump in the first place 
@_date: 2018-04-09 13:01:47
yeah, shame on people wanting to use a cryptocurrency as currency!
@_date: 2018-04-22 12:12:30
got barted 
@_date: 2018-04-04 17:30:49
is it really easier for you to believe a conspiracy theory than believing there’s just not enough interest in BTC right now? 
@_date: 2018-04-18 01:53:06
God bless us, everyone!
@_date: 2018-04-01 16:34:52
how old are you dude 
@_date: 2018-04-25 15:35:57
it’s almost kind of pathetic though lol, how many times are we really going to celebrate 9k? 
@_date: 2018-04-22 23:46:33
I don’t see how he and his close friends pooling their money together would be a scam. who is he scamming?

last chance to buy under 7k boys!!! Lmao
@_date: 2018-04-22 23:30:41
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:39:41
he said he receives payment in BTC and didn’t buy it and now needs the cash, not really a failed investment on his part

Is McAfee still considered a crypto believer if he’s getting paid $100,000+ for each tweet about crypto? 
@_date: 2018-04-12 01:02:46
it can’t hurt right lol 
@_date: 2018-04-05 13:32:13
this hanging around 6600 is making me uncomfortable

-$100: it’s all over
+$100: MOOOON
@_date: 2018-04-03 15:37:44
considering McAfee might have been paid to post his bet, do you think he’d really eat his own dick? dudes insane but idk

how often are you doing that though 
@_date: 2018-04-17 18:54:32

well, it was a good run

you’re right, I’ll definitely be celebrating but I’ll just be a little skeptical is all lol (: 
@_date: 2018-04-22 20:37:30
How will you divide it after the two years? Will it be based on each persons initial investment or just evenly? Very cool idea 
@_date: 2018-04-25 10:32:20
the memes are jinxing it
@_date: 2018-04-07 15:44:26
definitely enthusiastic, not sure if I could agree on the charming part.. 
@_date: 2018-04-20 23:04:01
I’m ecstatic right now, but I know it’s way too soon to start celebrating anything lol 
@_date: 2018-04-26 00:37:07
all that progress thrown awayy 
@_date: 2018-04-21 11:29:12
Should be an interesting day today. Even if it ends up trending down again, I think the market will be a lot more optimistic after yesterday which is a sign of good things to come

@_date: 2018-04-14 21:35:03
Can someone tell me why it matters how much 1BTC is worth? The tech and it’s original purpose as a currency will exist at any price, so what is the reasoning behind wanting its fiat value to keep rising other than getting rich? I just can’t imagine many new users coming in at $100,000 after adoption when there’s already a Bitcoin 1% who were really just lucky enough to get in early. 
Not a no-coiner, just curious

don’t worry guys, you can still get your lambos. You’ll just need about 59BTC is all 
@_date: 2018-04-06 12:40:19
how low are we getting today?

no one who could actually move the market would be hanging out in here and they definitely wouldn’t be taking any advice from anyone here lol 
@_date: 2018-04-21 11:30:25
same person confirmed 
@_date: 2018-04-25 15:05:25
you’re assuming he owns his own business and doesn’t just work for someone else who decided to pay people with BTC. sure that might be the case but there’s still no reason to attack him. 
@_date: 2018-04-28 20:54:14
well then I hope you can focus only on your memories of good times with them and properly celebrate their lives 
@_date: 2018-04-07 19:02:54
Yes, but the 10 minutes to write what is essentially “ignore trolls” and addressing a person who won’t see it gives the impression of not having a life. I’m just messing with you lol 
@_date: 2018-04-03 17:11:28
@_date: 2018-04-05 16:16:54
ehh, already in the red. lol

lol someone’s cranky
@_date: 2018-04-14 22:59:13
That makes sense and I understand the logic, thank you for actually replying btw. but also, isn’t a lower price more widely accessible and therefore good for adoption? Obviously I know you don’t have to buy a full coin, but wouldn’t the average person feel more comfortable buying a fraction of say, 8k, compared to 100k? 
@_date: 2018-04-28 20:14:24
nice, I hope you have a good time dude 
@_date: 2018-04-07 18:43:48
lol well your first mistake was coming to this thread for true insight 
@_date: 2018-04-25 13:43:45
RIP 9k
@_date: 2018-04-04 14:18:44
wow, down almost $200 during my shower lol
@_date: 2018-04-14 23:14:34
well that’s my point. 1BTC will always be 1BTC. why would it matter if 1BTC = 8k or 100k. If anything, wouldn’t 8k be better seeing as you would be able to buy more full coins for the same amount of fiat?
@_date: 2018-04-05 01:28:31
6.5k here we come 
@_date: 2018-04-18 14:58:43
here it goes again 
@_date: 2018-04-20 23:12:26
we don’t even know if it will hold this yet, hoping for the best but that’s been a bad strategy lately 
@_date: 2018-04-19 03:19:28
nah, you just need 50BTC, nbd
