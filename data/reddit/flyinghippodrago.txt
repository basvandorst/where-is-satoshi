Well over the last 7 days it dropped from a high of 15.5k to 9k whereas etc dropped 1450 to 850ish about the same percentage wise and they both bounce back, but a month ago btc was nearly up to 20k.

True but even if you bought at every single high point in the entirety of Bitcoin's existence, you would have still made money by holding it. Sure the past doesnt indicate the future, but when you look at the graphs of previous "bubbles" you can see that it just soared a bit too early and reached its true value a bit later down the line.

It is believed to be about an Olympic swimming pool in volume. Which is crazy to me that all the gold in the world and all that will ever be mined will fit in a swimming pool...

Ripple is a way for the banking industry to send large amounts of money instantly and to different countries. It has recently had some adoption in different banks and there are over 75 banks on the network now. believe you can buy it on polo.
