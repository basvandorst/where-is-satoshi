I am also having the same issue right now and your reddit post came up in my search  so I thought I'd add my confirmation you are not alone.
Perhaps their NTP server is down and their time is off. I checked my time sources are all sync'd here.

Hopefully you've also heard from support as I just did. Seems they've been doing some maintenance that might have interrupted the 2FA. It's working for me now.

So is this going to use your own/private blockchain or run on another blockchain such as Ethereum?

Just because "Open" is in the name OpenCoin does not mean it is open at all. It is a closed system. It is a scam. Move on.

It was moved from AMC-PT to ACTIVEMINING which is the new venture. Read the News section on BTCT about the merger with VMC.

I was not paid to post that link and I do not agree with the sentiments in the other subreddit either. A system backed by IOUs ie debt is stupid as the world found out in 2008 with the GFC

unless you're a big multinational where it's tax avoidance (shifting profits) and not a crime. :)

Buy SatoshiDice shares instead.

Works a treat. Thanks for the service.

Not sure if this is complete enough for me as it does not take into account getting your funds to MtGox, only individual BTC trades.
I'm pretty new to it and still waiting for my MtGox account to be verified so I can add AUD funds for trading, but from the FAQ it looks like their financing partner takes a 3.45% deposit fee. The other option of sending an International wire transfer would also have a deposit cost that adds to the 'buying price'. There is probably a cost in withdrawing AUD funds back to my account either by internation transfer (I remember seeing a reference to 4000 yen?) or local bank deposit, whatever mechanism they use. 
In my case I didn't wait for MtGox to verify my account so I could add AUD but instead used a local company (BitInnovate) to buy coins at a 7.9% commission at 1BTC=68AUD, so it really cost me 1BTC=73AUD (commission included). Glad I did, becuase I'm STILL waiting for MtGox to verify my account, and the current rate is about 1BTC=125AUD.
Anyway it is a good reference point for me and thanks for making the spreadsheet.

so maybe the size of the blockchain will stop growing so quickly now it's gone

I was doing random bets here and there (with accompanying dopamine reward rush) and got up about 1BTC, then for laughs wrote (yet-another) martingale bot to make the bets automatically, but in my haste to test it I (stupidly) put a == in an if statement instead of a &gt;= so it never stopped betting and half a day later it had lost the bankroll. However a check of the log showed I was up about 2.4BTC at one point. Since I only used my initial 1BTC winnings from some random bets I walked away even.
Actually, I walked away ahead, because in writing the bot I learnt how to write bitcoin enabled (web) apps in python to use the bitcoind daemon's RPC API to make and check payments. All a bit of fun really. But yes, house always wins. Gambling is dumb.
@_date: 2013-05-01 03:53:48
I run the bitcoind on the server, which has an RPC on port 8332 which will have it's own wallet, and it's just a matter of sending JSON calls to it and getting the result. I took a look at  for a bitcoin python module which worked ok in a pinch. Also look at  for the API and examples in other languages.

I went and bought BTC through a local supplier at $68aud, but with a high premium (7.9%, making it really $73aud per btc) because MtGox was taking so long. Over 2 weeks later, I'm now verified by MtGox, but the price is $140. Lucky I didn't wait, or I would have paid more. That being said, now I can fund from an Australian bank easily and cheaper. I started at 18640 in the queue.

I said it in jest, but peppered here and there in forum posts I remember seeing references to it being public.. ahh browser history to the rescue - from  the quote:
"Since August 20, 2012 SatoshiDice shares are publicly traded[6] at MPEx under S.DICE symbol and paying monthly dividends."
I looked at MPEx (some sort of BTC share exchange) but since you need 30BTC to apply for an account I haven't bothered looking into it further, since I'm only just starting to understand bitcoin exchanges, let alone share exchanges.

Jeez they are "thinking about" bitcoin. Paypal is a competitor to BTC as a 'digital currency'/way to buy things online.
Paypal "thinking about" bitcoin is like the "music industry" thinking about Napster. This business is looking at ways to discredit and destroy it, as they can't make money from it and it takes away from Paypal's revenue streams. 
Paypal and its friends, the related credit card companies, also arbitrarily freeze the accounts of organisations that certain governments don't agree with. Would you really trust your BTC wallet to them with a track record like that?

So can we get the recipes/source from this restaurant, and submit improvements, new sauces, in true GPL fashion?

Ripple and Opencoin are not opensource.

Damn although I'm in Sydney this week I can't make it due to just finding out about it! I really should find out if there's any interest in a BTC meetup in Hobart every now and then. *tumbleweeds roll past*
