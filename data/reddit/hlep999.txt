Cexbro? What is that like grindr or something?

10 years later, when you had the US gov(Chuck Schumer) and mainstream media commenting on Bitcoin as far back in 2011.  
You'd have to be a bit delusional to consider yourself an early adopter at this point imo.

It's kind of funny that I guess someone tried to make a shitcoin of a shitcoin though.
@_date: 2019-08-14 19:50:57
Eh? I'm talking about season 5 where they made the ICO to try to raise funds again for their perpetually failing company.
@_date: 2019-08-13 20:32:17
They even did a shitcoin ICO in Silicon Valley.

Which is exactly how some people were buying it in 2010(and possibly 2011) on bitcointalk if I remember correctly. Cash by mail. Options were limited.

I primarily used instawallet back in the day and lost various instawallet urls having left over change being what would have been pennies or dimes worth of BTC back in the day. Sometimes I wonder how much that would add up to now.

Central banks target price inflation, not money supply.

I think it really depends, but that's probably not a universal truth.
@_date: 2019-04-29 06:42:18
The theory behind it is that they're gaining more than they're losing by allowing the additional payment options, so there isn't necessarily any money to recoup by rasing prices. Although reality is complicated and situations are going to vary.
@_date: 2019-04-29 06:13:05
Lots of people actually gain far more money back than they pay in interest and fees. Cash back, perks,  points, insurance, and the utility of having available credit(allowing you to put more of your actual money into things like Bitcoin).
The merchants shoulder most of the costs and fees.
The thing is that someone who is smart enough to use and properly secure their Bitcoin is also probably someone who can use credit and gain far more than they lose (in some cases). 
As a spending tool a decent credit card is vastly better. As investment the two simply can't be compared, since Bitcoin is one and a credit card obviously isn't. 
Not sure why people still try to put Bitcoin up against credit cards in these sorts of categories.
@_date: 2019-04-29 18:03:40


It really depends on where you are and various other factors.
@_date: 2019-04-30 17:51:11
It's obviously not a fundamental truth when you consider an example like this:
If I have the knowledge that charging $100 for my widget that costs me $10 to make is the most profitable price point for me when considering both profit and volume, and I add a credit card processor that charges 3% to my payment options that gains me more sales, it doesn't change the fact that $100 is the more I can charge before I lose more money via reduced volume. 
It's really not a fundamental truth at all. It depends on many factors and situations.
@_date: 2019-04-29 17:32:23
Obviously I don't think they are 'free' in a wider scope, but in a heads up comparison in the scope of a spending tool for a consumer, it's not much of a contest in 2019.
@_date: 2019-04-29 06:18:00
I've seen it before, but isn't it commonly not allowed for a merchant to charge more for credit card payments rather than say cash or similar?
@_date: 2019-04-29 17:39:07
I don't really disagree, but that doesn't really change the fact that credit cards are a better value proposition for spending money for anyone who uses them rationally.
I'm not trying to make some meta argument that credit cards are some how better for the economy or something like that. Just better for the consumer in the short term.


Considering I was replying to someone who said 'Fuck you are dumb' to a normal post, after railing off a bad one liner example, my tone might have been a bit bad. But I don't think it was that bad relatively speaking. And I agree that there are some very smart people here.
@_date: 2019-04-29 17:41:03




No, I just believe it's better to spend money you were already going to spend anyway and can replenish with credit card and edge out a bit of additional value rather than spend BTC. I think it's obvious that it's better to save Bitcoin rather than spend it.
@_date: 2019-04-29 18:01:50
Depends on the state/country, but it varies a lot: 
@_date: 2019-04-29 06:44:11
It's definitely not allowed in many if not most cases by the payment processor agreement.
Not sure if there is specific regulation not allowing it in various jurisdictions, but I wouldn't be surprised if there was too.
@_date: 2019-04-29 06:15:02
If you have debt, inflation is the opposite of what you're saying though. Think about it.
@_date: 2019-04-29 17:35:33
Yes, that is quite true. However, I'd also totally expect to many people to be giving this information 'for free' via blockchain analysis and companies that gather and sell that data. Hopefully via Schorr Signatures and such that will become less of an issue as privacy improves.

It's far more complicated than you make it out to be. It's certainly not as simple as 'the merchant passes on costs to the consumer'. The general theory behind it is that the merchant is making more profit by increased sales. It's going to vary from case to case, but credit cards almost certainly do increase economic activity in general. It also helps that it the payment processors had the foresight to require merchants to charge a single price for both cash and credit in most agreements.
Also, generally you'd work off the base assumption that the merchant is always going to charge as much as the market will bear regardless. The idea of 'passing on costs' comes up a lot but doesn't really make a lot of sense unless you think of it as a sales tactic to soften the blow of increasing prices(psychological tactic to increase the amount consumers will pay, ie increase what the market will bear). 
I've found it really common that people here and elsewhere in the community really love to try to over simplify complex economic issues like you're doing here. I'm not saying I have all the answers at all, but it's certainly not as simple as you make it out to be.
@_date: 2019-04-29 17:47:03
Probably the case with high demand, low margin businesses, yes.
But yes, the general idea is that people who take advantage of the system by avoiding paying interest and exploring cash back and such are being subsidized by those who don't. 
I'm not saying this is 'good' or anything, just that it's more rational to do that than spend your BTC.
@_date: 2018-11-11 01:51:39
Conversely, anyone buying Bitcoin because they think it's awesome for buying coffee is also confused.
@_date: 2018-11-25 01:55:13




It isn't necessarily one, only the market determines that. I wouldn't be surprised if Bitcoin or something like it becomes a better version of gold eventually. And people who thought that gold was a good store of value end up holding the bag there, making it a poor store of value in a modern world. Who knows though.


Price inflation vs money supply inflation, I mentioned both types. Generally the only thing that matters and the only thing that people mean when they use the word 'inflation' is price inflation though. 
But since the BTC money supply is also being inflated by mining, it's not really honest to say it can't be inflated. Better to say something like 'predictable money supply inflation' or something.
@_date: 2018-11-09 01:40:44
I've seen it happen so many times over the years now that sadly I can't say I'm too shocked to hear it.

Cobra the guy from bitcoin.org supports BCH and/or Craig Wright?
@_date: 2018-11-25 01:04:58
Because you can now buy 75% less of the stuff you spend the value on that rusts and rots, like cars and food. The value has diminished. 
Can't be inflated? The price certainly can, as we can see here today at $3800. and price inflation is all that anyone cares about. And the money supply itself is inflating at 12.5 BTC per block every 10 minutes on average I checked too. So both the price and the money supply is inflating.
I like Bitcoin a lot. But let's not get delusional here either. It's not healthy imo.

Wasn't it like was 2 of 3, and their idea of a 2 of 3 service was to just auto sign the 2nd key when Bitfinex signed their key? Effectively just making it a 1 of 1 and their service completely superfluous?
I hope I'm wrong, but I remember that's what it appeared to be at the time. And I don't remember anyone ever correcting that conception.

They mean they don't seem to inversely correlate. That would be neat though.

Thousands of percentage points gets vastly less realistic the higher the market caps goes though. Past performance is in a totally different context when someone with a million dollars actually mattered in the market.

That's why I always use bitcoin to buy BTC.
