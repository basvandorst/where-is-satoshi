You can exchange inside Exodus, they have a number of alt coins. Move BTC in a larger amount, so the fee is worth it
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:44:04

Everybody, the OP did not send his adult son to college, the child is just 1 year old! Getting rid of the most scarce non-renewable asset that appreciates daily and has a potential of going x10, or even x100 in near years, let alone decades from now AND the 529 is not even fully funded after that. This is an example of what not to do to all the new BTC investors.

Coinbase is considered a reputable website and safe, but if you hold long term I would move BTC to a desktop wallet, like BitPay or Exodus, and also invest in the upcoming Trezor T hardware wallet. Keeping it on an exchange is not recommend

The altcoins are annoying in a sense, that they may go up in $ value, but in reality they are just following BTC, so you are not getting any more BTC from some of them.

I'm going to explain the situation to you:
- the market only went from 20 billion to 800 billion in under a year 
- I mean, despite memecoins being accepted nowhere as real payment, the crypto market was ONLY worth more than Google itself 
- dogecoin was only worth a measly 2 billion dollars
- Bitcoin only became completely unusable without paying huge fucking fees 
- we only had every normie ever investing and we also had constant segments on the news dedicated to us 
- now that all the smart people dumped ATH, the normies are only dumping their bags at an 80% loss (Why didn't they HODL like us?)
It's a mystery as to why crypto didn't continue going exponential forever and ever.

Crypto already made the most millionaires within the 2015-2017 range. So even if crypto evaporates right now like it never happened it would still have been the greatest transfer of wealth in human history.

Anyone who lived online, built computers, played games, did folding knew about Bitcoin

'Buy the dip' is the song of r/Bitcoin since 15k. 
Rule  Do the opposite of what r/Bitcoin says
@_date: 2018-03-20 14:50:57
You are all typing the same paragraphs down to every keyword, and pop in every thread with massive upvotes. Soon "Venezuelan here" is gonna be a meme
@_date: 2018-03-29 16:03:06
Just humans doing their thing
@_date: 2018-03-20 00:32:58
Wait for Chinese New Year dip to pass, oh wait

To answer your original question, my Facebook profile photo has me in a Che hat and his quote and I consider Stalin to be an important figure of that time (no picture on a wall though), so people like that do exist 
@_date: 2018-03-22 16:04:13
She's legal now, fyi
@_date: 2018-03-29 21:05:19
You believed the 100k 2018 meme
@_date: 2018-03-23 02:11:51
A lot of people praise them, as they are the ones who opposed the western murderers and oppressors, it all depends who's history books you are reading.
@_date: 2018-03-29 15:42:40
The only free money I have, is to short Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-03-29 16:02:25
What are you defending here, the manipulators?
@_date: 2018-03-29 19:58:28
It is falling and will fall for a while, I just don't want to use mental energy to short 
@_date: 2018-03-29 15:36:52
That's not some random event
@_date: 2018-03-29 22:31:10
The storm has passed my meme TA says 9k

Yes, but where are we?

There's always one, it awaits and strikes

If you are serious, those are the high volume chart candles

Do you have a proof that miners have been kidnapped? Link?

You are not a whale

We all know where this is going

Troll harder. Petro will help venezuelans to bypass the US imposed sanctions, which is the actual reason for food shortages.
@_date: 2018-02-25 03:32:24
His comment history has inconsistencies and I see similar posts on every Petro Youtube video, I would assume it's a paid troll, but thanks for giving your perspective
@_date: 2018-03-30 00:54:22
The day the Earth stood still 
@_date: 2018-03-29 20:37:23
That capitulation "you are here" meme chart gets shifted all the time, don't know where we are anymore, not dispair yet
@_date: 2018-03-29 21:08:16
Don't worry guys, people always cash out at this time of the year to pay for their elaborate April fool's prank setups.
@_date: 2018-03-29 21:44:38
Use him as ATM for quick cash (also use a dildo on him from ass to mouth)
@_date: 2018-03-23 04:16:15
Lenin did that, and then Stalin stepped in and put a stop to an intervention (until the malicious West sent Hitler in another attempt) and Che is fucking awesome, I visited the guerrilla museum, they were the underdogs fighting for their people, if it wasn't for the economic blockade, they probably could've built something out of their country
@_date: 2018-03-30 01:23:25
@_date: 2018-03-20 06:17:08
He is not, I see the same cookie cutter comments all over Reddit from these "Venezuelans" with contradicting comment history
@_date: 2018-03-24 18:53:49
This sculpture looks like someone without a taste threw a bunch of garbage together, no color coordination even
@_date: 2018-03-29 18:36:37
Just don't be a hero trying to hodl and support buy, this behavior is a meme. I used to be, now I exit coins at the right time and all my money is safe and sound

Someone make it stop, it's illegal to deprive me of my funds

An average person is already clueless about BTC developments, it's up to us to dissect information and expose dishonest companies, your concerns do not help.
@_date: 2018-03-30 01:08:09
Can't wait to see 5900, just for lulz at this point
@_date: 2018-02-23 18:20:57
So you have nothing to eat, but you have a perfect internet and happily spend your days chatting up on Reddit? If you are spending a month of salary on one meal does it mean you eat once a month?
@_date: 2018-03-11 03:27:09
Some kind of voting system, a consensus
@_date: 2018-03-30 19:36:56
Many chances were given to get out, even at 8, people are waiting for an imaginary "next rally", things like that take months if not years to consolidate
@_date: 2018-03-30 04:25:03
This is just people selling off, happens every April
@_date: 2018-02-23 18:43:53
Why so negative?
@_date: 2018-03-29 15:24:20
It's like you are a lost cause, a nut job
@_date: 2018-03-30 00:52:22
Massive rekt, all lost 
@_date: 2018-03-30 00:38:57
Holding works on the other side of the mountain, but when you see a massive long-term downfall forming, you sell and do not listen to a community begging you not to. I sold all my alts in Feb, saved money, Bitcoin, however, is a tough one, legend says it always comes back (alts are garbage with no application)
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:24:54
Red dildo incoming

A good summary of what's happening: 
@_date: 2018-03-20 00:40:47
Based on posts on a local forum, people pulled $10k, 30k, 100k, 500k, and one guy sent 1.27 mil to his bank account. My portfolio went from 50k to 4.5 and I only sent $1k so far.
@_date: 2018-02-23 18:14:10
Are you sure you are a true Venezuelan? 
@_date: 2018-03-15 03:19:46
I'm tired of your bullshit 
@_date: 2018-02-24 00:22:32
Usually, when someone is labeled a dictator and other buzzwords, it means the opposite, probably a guy trying to escape the dollar hegemony. Aljazeera also works for the wrong side, producing fake pro-terrorist reports for various groups
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:22:10
Never would I have believed we would be fighting between 8 and 7, these numbers were a distant memory
@_date: 2018-02-13 21:26:18
If you get your news from a mainstream source you are doing it wrong
@_date: 2018-03-30 03:01:11
True they let people sink in more money and then continue to nonchalantly sell more
@_date: 2018-02-23 18:38:53
In earlier comments he said he escaped the country a year ago, then suddenly he's talking about having nothing to eat in his city (while using an internet)
@_date: 2018-03-19 14:17:59
Stipend looks good, with a freelance services website in the works
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:20:36
We need more 6k memes, come on, keep the positive spirit alive
@_date: 2018-03-10 01:02:26
I'm gonna watch this like a hawk
@_date: 2018-03-23 00:21:08
Yeah, keep believing an article from a mainstream (fake) media, The Star could have written anything they wanted.
@_date: 2018-02-24 09:56:07
You said earlier you escaped the country a year ago, and now you are talking about being hungry in your home town. Just trying to figure out who is spreading what, you or the OP
@_date: 2018-02-23 17:15:40
Are you all paid shills? Every top comment has the same negative message with the keywords "dictator", "criminals", "bad"
@_date: 2018-04-04 03:55:43
I don't care, you can't be possibly that helpless and stupid, kid or not, being young is not an excuse
@_date: 2018-04-04 04:00:23
I'm more impressed there was a hard drive at all in 1956. I haven't seen/heard of a computer until late 90's.
