How long did it take for 1 confirm after you used btc.com? I just ended up paying for it.

As if living with your parents at 22 is a problem... nice passive aggressive article BI.  Regardless, great job by the kid.

He is a lying coward who doesnt want to pay his debts! He has 1.85 BTC already yet claims he can't afford to pay Yusaf.

There's nothing to explain. It's clear as day. You are a lazy swine who chooses gambling and making extremely childish and foolish wagers online hoping to strike big. You are not a man of character and it's obvious with how you carry yourself that no reputable agency would be willing to hire you. You prefer to "Get Rich Quick" by gambling instead of getting off your ass and finding a respectable source of income. Yet somehow you have 1.85 BTC in your Trezor wallet. Mindblowing. Don't worry, Karma always finds you.

Don't even try and bullshit that you don't have the 1 BTC either. u/YusafIslamEfud showed proof that you have 1.85 BTC in your Trezor wallet. What a disgusting, fake apology. If you are going to lie and pretend to be "sorry" at least try and make it somewhat believable.
Proof he has 1.85 BTC

What good is a wall of text apology when you still owe this man money? Get a job and pay up!
@_date: 2018-12-11 19:51:59
This post? Even moreso of a solidifcation that you are delusional and think you can get away with your actions by simply apologizing. Be a man of your word and Own up and Pay up.

Easier said than done? You made a completely idiotic bet most likely because you are a gambling addict and you were banking on the fact that you were right so he would have to pay you 1 BTC. The fact that you lost the bet means nothing to you because you can simply move on with your life and forget this ever happened. There were 2 ways this could have went for you. Either you were right and got 1BTC or wrong and you never intended on paying anyways. This post is just shameful. Do you have a disability? Do you have 2 arms and 2 legs? If so, print out some resumes and start walking around your town. There's no excuse for you not to get a job and it's actually something very easy to do.
