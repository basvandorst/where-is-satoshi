We are already running a [Bitcoin only prediction market]( for about 20 month and we would be very happy to use such a sidechain and decentralize the project further!
@_date: 2015-06-23 06:51:01
especially mining incentives/ the economics of fees can not be tested on the testnet.

We created a market on whether or not a fork will be done for sidechains:

1) if you ddos a pool with 20% hash rate for one day you lower the hashrate in this 2 week difficulty period by 20%/14=1.4%. This is a 1.4% lower difficulty for the next 2 weeks. Of course that would make economical sense for a pool..
2) you mine at the other pool but you only submit shares (never a real block) So you get most of the revenue for the shares anyway and you also lower the difficulty to profit from it as in case 1)...
You really have to do the math - than you see the attack makes sense.
@_date: 2014-11-15 17:39:22
@_date: 2014-09-30 17:14:04
of course there are more sophisticated methods of hedging but this basic concept is always the same.

If you want to test it on testnet first and you are looking for a page to do something with testnet coins:  This is our test site that runs on testnet coins. Don't expect that we care much about it - but you get a deposit address and you can at least deposit and withdraw testnet coins. That makes testing DarkWallet more fun...

actually we just created [a bet on the outcome of this bet]( We have done this to demonstrate the different betting systems. On bitbet the current odds for yes are: 1.46 and for no: 1.79 and they are not even guaranteed. If the event you bet on becomes more likely more people will bet on it and your odds (payout) will become worse.
This is different to the fixed odds system on our site. Here you choose your odds and as soon someone accepts them the bet will become active. (And the odds can not change) 
@_date: 2014-10-01 20:41:10
I don't give a shit
@_date: 2014-11-17 21:50:53
number of wallets would super interesting. You can assume that addresses that where used together for a transaction belong to the same wallet. If you repeat this process of joining addresses to a wallet (building the transitive closure) you can end up with an estimate. (Coin join stuff could influence the outcome but should have very little effect)
@_date: 2014-08-19 16:41:41
Ok - you are right - go for it - we will pay you the 0.02
@_date: 2014-07-26 07:04:12
yes, you are right - it is 1.012 - sorry.
And I guess our fees are a little bit misleading at the moment. We have a global fee (see  (for all predictions anonymous/ and from registered user) of 2% on the pure profit. (In your case the pure profit = (16*1.012) - 16 = 0,192. The fee is: 0,192*0,02 = 0,00384
In addition we have transactions fees only for the anonymous bets. This are the 1% and they are on the hole sum send. In your case this fee will eat more or less all of your profit so I would recommend to use an account for such predictions with very low odds and small amounts.
However, thanks for your question - it showed us that we have to somehow restructure the rules/FAQ to make thinks more clear for everyone. It is our clear goal to have transparent and reasonable low fees.
@_date: 2014-09-30 18:57:13
indeed - it only comes from people betting the alternative. If no one is willing to bet on the alternative the price will move until someone is...
@_date: 2014-10-11 16:42:35
you are right - but I don't like comments that start with "Ill probably get down-voted" and end up with &gt;100 upvotes...
@_date: 2014-08-01 07:34:03
We use this odds format: 
There are different ons. If we had used the odds you described to notation had been 1/1.012.
We are sorry for this confusion but we give a clear example in our FAQ and we use a standard odds format, thus we think it is unfair to say we "trick someone into something".

@_date: 2014-11-24 04:56:25
agreed - but luckily it is quite similar...
@_date: 2014-12-04 13:42:21
An attacker can still profit from doing this as long as he has a decent share of the hashrate mining real. Basically if you own x% of the global hashrate than this withhold block is worth four you x*Block-reward. (simply because you now have a x% chance of finding it) It is a little bit more complicated but this is the basic concept.
@_date: 2014-09-26 14:59:03
I think you don't need to agree to the arguments - but I don't think they are hilarious, indeed they are pretty valid. It does not happen very often that a company who accepts Bitcoin really understands Bitcoin. But a company that does NOT accept Bitcoin but understands Bitcoin is pretty rear.

@_date: 2014-07-26 00:16:25
What is your question?






@_date: 2014-09-20 04:26:10
We have created this event (BFL out of business at the end of the year) on our prediction market a few month ago. The changes just changed today morning from 10% to 50%...
@_date: 2014-11-14 17:22:39
that would have been an expensive post...
@_date: 2014-09-10 18:58:18
Four our site [fairlay]( ) this is 100% true. It took us about 6 month until we opened it and we still have done and will do a lot of improvements ever since. And I am pretty sure the same is true for BetMoose and Predictious.
@_date: 2014-11-27 04:59:18
will be interesting to see if the growth really stops/slows down in the longer run. Our market is still sceptical if the difficulty drop will happen: 
@_date: 2014-11-28 08:13:15
we can at least offer you a market on the first one:
@_date: 2014-08-19 16:42:52
here is the plain text:
Could it be that the price raise in last October/November was mainly driven by MtGox hackers?
Recently articles came up about an investigation of the Gox case. They say that hackers managed to create fake account on MtGox with a fiat currency balance. The hackers used this (newly created) fiat money to buy Bitcoin and withdraw them.
Could the price raise be driven by hackers?
From an article of the FT.com: According to Mr Maurice, a 29-year-old native of Honolulu whose business card describes him as “chief hacking officer”, the most likely explanation for the disappearance of the bitcoins is a series of raids beginning last year, in which a hacker gained access to Mt Gox’s database of account holders, assigned himself new accounts with faked cash balances, then bought and withdrew the virtual currency at will.
This information could changes the view on the price increase from $150 to &gt; $1000 drastically since it could be mainly driven my hackers spending "not existing" fiat.
The recent price drop may be caused by people who realized this recently since it would mean that most of the demand that drove the price to its hight was not real.
What does not fit to the story told by the MtGox investigators is that from all what is known from MtGox so far mainly Bitcoins has been missing in their books. If the reported version is true it should have been only fiat that was missing.
However - We from fairlay think the MtGox case is still very little understood by the community but it should be to complete this chapter. This is the reason why coinsearcher (the guy how flew to Japan) together with us set up some events to try to get some reasonable numbers for the likelihood of some MtGox theories.
@_date: 2014-09-30 18:01:11
[This prediction]( is the most simple example for hedging the Bitcoin price. Hedging is simply placing a bet on price drops. If it happens you will win money with the bet. If the price rises you will win money because of your Bitcoin holdings. But if price does not move - you lose.
To put it in different words - if the price drops you are not hurt otherwise you paid a fee for this risk elimination.
@_date: 2014-07-26 00:17:26
ok, we added that to our "todo list"...
@_date: 2014-10-20 23:26:18
thanks, the IP we posted is no option to initially get test-net coins. But to kind of use them...
@_date: 2014-09-14 07:43:21
actually we allow predictions on this: 
@_date: 2014-07-26 06:37:15
if a match is possible it should match immediately - the only reason I could imagine is that the transaction was not confirmed at that time. Could that have been the reason? Or was it already confirmed on the prediction page?
@_date: 2014-11-01 03:10:12
Since the beginning of Bitcoin there has only been a single day with &gt;100,000 transaction (Nov 28 2013) Lets [see]( if it happens until Nov 28 2014 again.

hm... not a single address in the top 100 uses multi-sig...
@_date: 2014-11-24 04:59:11
Since today there have been 2 day in Bitcoin history with &gt;100k transactions. User of our prediction market think with a likelihood of 20% this number will raise to 10 by the end of the year.

As a Bitcoin only prediction market of course you can bet on it on our site: 
@_date: 2014-10-16 17:00:31
We are a Bitcoin only company as well. We pay our employees in Bitcoin and we even set rates in Bitcoin - and I guess we can only do this because all of us have some kind of financial security. But we think it is important to price things/work in Bitcoin. Only then you are using it really as a currency instead of only as a payment system.
@_date: 2014-11-10 18:29:54
Sorry for the delay everyone - we did not noticed this post - We wonder why we did not received a notification when was mentioned in this post.
The reason for the delay was that we have a secure process of resolving events and we need to have 2 persons of our team to resolve them independently in the same way. Last weekend only one has been available. We try to avoid such situations but in a small team it is not always possible. And in general we think security is more important than a quick resolution.
@_date: 2014-10-14 16:36:19
No need of a killer app. The limited supply combined with a superior payment system will outperform every inflationary FIAT money.

[Mark Karpeles charged criminal offense]( - current likelihood: 22% (numbers from a prediction market)
@_date: 2014-07-27 00:50:55
yes - this is a risk. But obv. we send the money back if it not gets matched before closing date. Additionally you can set your own closing date (use the advanced form). This is a date until your prediction is valid - if it does not get matched by this time we send your money back.
However, both risks can be avoided with an account. First you can place your prediction instantly (if you have deposited BTC upfront) and second: you can cancel predictions any time as long as they are unmatched.
@_date: 2014-08-19 17:19:56
haha - good that we have a solution for this problem...
@_date: 2014-10-14 16:33:33
@_date: 2014-11-14 17:31:21
Just to explain the link more: we are a Bitcoin prediction market where users can bet against each other on such events. You find the transaction numbers [here]( By the way: we created a new prediction wether we will have 10 days of &gt; 100k transactions before Xmas: [here](
@_date: 2014-11-28 08:16:22
Whatever your prediction is: you can open a market on it here: 
@_date: 2014-08-08 16:08:09
We have created a prediction wether it will reach 1% by October. 
@_date: 2014-12-05 07:28:17
C'mon. We all like good news but this is simply not true. Actually it happened [3 times before...](
@_date: 2014-07-26 00:32:43
is this your prediction:  ?
This is matched completely. Thus you get back 16*1.18 (minus 2% fees on the profit) back if you win and 0 if you loose.
@_date: 2015-05-10 22:36:50
As a Bitcoin only business we can agree fully that faster block times would be very helpful. Even a conservative change to 5 minutes or 2.5 minutes would reduce the chance of 40 minutes times between blocks dramatically which regularly annoys our customers.
@_date: 2014-07-25 18:49:00
It is the different betting system. At bitbet they have a pari mutuel betting system. That means that bets/predictions that happens AFTER your predictions define how much money you get back if you are right.
Our system is like a market place. People can offer predictions with odds and others can accept them. So you always no what you will get BEFORE.
This is important since probabilities can change. On bitbet if your prediction will get more likely over time more people will predict on it and you will get less money therefor.
In more detail we have answered the question here:

We like your work! Would be exciting to see the first asset with a decent market cap on colored coins!
@_date: 2014-09-30 18:05:53
that is true but it is true for hedging in general. If you hedge against more than you actually have you are simply speculating on a price drop. And by the way - this is a legitimate part of a free market.
@_date: 2014-08-19 17:19:14
You are right - it is for sure not the only explanation but we are talking about roughly 7% of all Bitcoins in existence that had been moved irregularly in this time - however this had happened - it seems possible that the price raise was a side effect of this fraud.

Little context - roughly 3.5 years ago we have been extremely excited about Bitcoin and decided to build a startup around it. We are convinced that prediction markets are a very useful tool to aggregate information via market mechanisms. Prediction markets are legal in big parts of the world. However - because there are some jurisdictions where they are not or so heavily regulated that it is impractical to run such a market it is not so easy to find a payment processor that would work with a prediction market. Chargebacks are another big problem. Bitcoin obviously solves both and gives us a big costs advantage over fiat market (they often pay 3-5% to the payment processor) Those costs are of course indirectly forwarded to the users in form of higher fees. We have a range of markets (sports) where we don't take a fee AT ALL! On markets like this one we only take 2% of the net winnings which is at least 50% cheaper then other sides.
If you tried fairlay.com previously let us know how your experience has been. If you are new and just want to "lurk" have a look here what is going on:

hm... haven't done the math. But it might be that the variance of a large pool that rewards blocks higher than shares might still be lower compared to a pool where all members trust each other. But you are right, in principal it is a force towards decentralization.

Pools can defend against block withholding by paying more for real blocks compared to shares. However, this would increase the variance for all miner in this pool.

We don't want to whine - but we have a trust problem within the Bitcoin community (and obviously for good reasons) However - this leads to the awkward situation that if none-Bitcoin sites accept Bitcoin they make it to the top of r/Bitcoin. However - we are a Bitcoin only betting exchange since 2 years and you will find way better odds at us (thanks to the low costs of Bitcoin) than any Fiat bookie. However - any time we posted something it gets downvoted away very quickly - so we stopped trying.
We understand the trust concerns but this bookie clearly does not deserve more trust only because they are based on fiat. We hope there will soon be completely trustless solutions for betting.
