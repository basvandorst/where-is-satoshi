Why aren't you?
@_date: 2013-04-05 14:44:56
i really hate these kind of posts.. just because they're similar doesn't mean they're the same.
@_date: 2013-11-29 16:07:32
Why does this guy have so many downvotes? lol
@_date: 2013-04-05 15:07:18
i'm just saying, if they gave it a positive light it would be better. it's not an issue. never said it was.
@_date: 2013-04-22 21:56:59
when did you e-mail him and how long did it take for you to get a response?
@_date: 2013-11-26 03:32:26
That's fair. But if you open up shop in the US, you should definitely be liable for the services you provide.
Bitfloor is NY based.
@_date: 2013-11-15 19:31:45
Honestly have no idea. Most people got it wired to them.
@_date: 2013-11-11 16:26:58
@_date: 2013-11-07 15:02:00
Well, I still see my bitcoins present in my account. I just can't withdraw it. 
With that, I think I still have a case.
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:39:27
Prepare for the downvotes for people who read the first sentence LOL
**disclaimer: I upvoted you :)**
Edit: you would get the most up votes after I make that comment haha
@_date: 2013-04-15 00:08:02
It's like we're twins because the same shit keeps happening to me, haha.

Please send me an e-mail with your reddit username. wwj710
There is an option that I want to pursue but I will need everyone's help.

Congrats then =]
If you could upvote that would be awesome.
@_date: 2013-04-05 16:38:03
so you're telling me if you had 20k in btc and 20k in usd.. and you saved 1k to purchase something in btc, you wouldn't use the btc?
@_date: 2013-04-05 16:48:42
because you can save 1k spending the BTC instead of the USD
@_date: 2013-11-08 16:44:10
please send me a SS of it with you trying to withdraw it and the date and time.
@_date: 2013-04-05 16:18:29
is saving good for the economy though?
@_date: 2013-04-04 20:24:11
so who dictates the fee?
@_date: 2013-04-03 01:48:51
can you let me know when yours is? I'm still waiting as well :(
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:58:35
it will drop down to the price of everything else.. i don't think that people will sell for like 30 dollars... they prob bought in for more.
@_date: 2013-11-08 16:42:50
how many BTC do you have locked up?
please send me a SS of it with you trying to withdraw it and the date and time.
@_date: 2013-05-02 17:43:36
Can you please send me an e-mail from support please?
@_date: 2013-11-08 16:44:00
please send me a SS of it with you trying to withdraw it and the date and time.
@_date: 2013-04-04 16:03:28
yeah, same here. i was watching the dip and saying "GOD DAMN WHERE'S MY WIRE TRANSFER"
@_date: 2013-04-03 17:23:43
look, you can trust mainstream media all you want, but are they really more informative than anyone else here on reddit?
we know more about how bitcoins work more than they do, once it reaches a 10billion dollar cap.... why would any fortune 500 company deny themselves of such a lucrative demographic?
@_date: 2013-11-15 15:07:37
Doesn't mean we shouldn't try.
@_date: 2013-11-25 04:24:35
what's your e-mail?
@_date: 2013-04-05 16:17:23
YUP :P
@_date: 2013-04-05 14:42:36
yeah, i mean, they could present the idea that bitcoin is a new and fascinating concept and the money will be even quicker imo... however in the end of the day, the fundamentals of bitcoin will prevail.
more and more people will do research on their own.
@_date: 2013-11-08 19:52:52
When they shut down.
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:56:54
so you're using bitcoinity?
@_date: 2013-11-29 17:06:34
I'm a libertarian and I believe it makes sense for us to have them. I would like to see us use strictly crypto currency in the future.
Obviously I think I can make money with it, but that's not the sole reason for it. I wouldn't downvote NMC if someone started accepting it as a form of payment.
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:04:57
Yes I did.
@_date: 2013-10-21 17:43:49
no, what's the memo?
@_date: 2013-03-30 16:50:52
even if they do that.. you could just create an alternative.. like litecoins. people would adopt litecoins and the government would have to buy a couple billion buying litecoins.
@_date: 2013-04-04 22:08:46
true, but they use CapitalOne for wire transfers.
They use cash for BOA
@_date: 2013-04-04 22:04:29
how do you know that?
@_date: 2013-11-20 15:11:01
Got it.
@_date: 2013-11-07 14:03:01
Did you screenshot it?
@_date: 2013-11-15 15:24:22
That's exactly why I'm trying to include everyone. It's easier for us to fight this as a whole rather than as individuals.
@_date: 2013-11-07 14:02:51
So you weren't able to screenshot it?
@_date: 2013-11-26 15:26:07
USD has been returned and they made a statement for that.
BTC has never been mentioned.
@_date: 2013-04-05 16:28:47
does it matter if btc is at 100 dollars or rather than 50 dollars? 
a pizza used to cost 10kBTC... now it cost 0.1384BTC.. i think it's great that the the price is going up because that means it is becoming a bigger market. as it becomes a bigger market, more and more companies will see the opportunity and will try to market towards that market.
@_date: 2013-11-08 20:47:44
how much money is owed to you?
@_date: 2013-04-05 16:23:40
what if it was cheaper to use BTC? would you use it over USD then?
@_date: 2013-11-07 22:10:35
It's been literally impossible to contact Roman.
I'm trying to set up an excel spreadsheet.
Please screenshot your BTC balance with you trying to attempt to withdraw with the current date and time and PM it to me please.
@_date: 2013-12-11 02:36:16
Might want to because we're at the point where we're getting an attorney
@_date: 2013-04-05 15:43:28
put in what you are okay to lose. i don't think that most people that are buying btc have the same goal of buying low and selling high.
for me, i'm buying to hold long term until the price stabilizes and i will start to use it probably.
@_date: 2013-04-08 14:52:27
i was thinking about using armory, would you suggest using that?
@_date: 2013-11-26 03:07:48
I had my google authenticator reset so I couldn't log in. After a couple of months they reset it and when I tried to log in, was unable to withdraw.
@_date: 2013-04-05 16:51:30
use bitfloor and do a cash deposit at BOA
@_date: 2013-11-11 19:22:37
It's Bitcoins... why would they not be available?
@_date: 2013-04-05 15:25:29
so you think they're trying to beef up the price of bitcoins because they're heavily invested in it, or people who influence fox heavily has a lot invested in bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-11-09 04:55:05
Won't let me.
@_date: 2013-04-05 16:20:15
that's true, well i don't think we could bail anyone out with bitcoins can we?
@_date: 2013-04-18 20:43:24
yeah, i just can't access my account so i'm getting a bit worried. 
but bitfloor hasn't let me down yet.
@_date: 2013-03-30 16:57:25
1) Get monies
2) Sign up for bitfloor acount
3) Sign up for blockchain account
4) Create a deposit amount on bitfloor via cash or wire transfer
5) follow said rules that they give you
6) go to BOA and deposit the funds
7) then buy however many btc you want to buy on bitfloor
8) withdraw that number of btc from your bitfloor with an address you create on your blockchain account.
9) now get excited as the price keeps rising
@_date: 2013-11-29 16:30:08
It's a lot of greed. Thankfully I own both (well, no, I'm still forming the movement to get my BTC back from Roman)
@_date: 2013-04-05 17:09:55
should be fine buy it and move it to blockchain for now and then paper wallet
@_date: 2013-04-22 15:09:45
thanks, i feel better
@_date: 2013-11-29 15:50:45
PM'd you.
@_date: 2013-11-08 16:42:58
how many BTC do you have locked up?
please send me a SS of it with you trying to withdraw it and the date and time.
@_date: 2013-04-05 02:03:42
damn.. now that fox portrayed bitcoins in a positive light, i might have to reevaluate my stance on bitcoins
@_date: 2013-11-26 01:26:34
I still give him the benefit of the doubt because who knows why he won't respond. Perhaps it's for legal reasons. At any rate, we all want our Bitcoins back and this has gone on for too long.
@_date: 2013-11-10 22:01:20
Did you PM me from another account? Or same one. Not sure if I accounted for your balance yet.
@_date: 2013-11-15 23:22:55
Ohhh, sorry about that. Read that wrong.
@_date: 2013-04-04 17:51:54
from what i read, transaction fees are assigned by the miner.. so when there are lots of miners, the fees will be competitive, meaning that it should be pretty low.
@_date: 2013-04-26 02:19:52
I did that, 4 times via e-mail.
@_date: 2013-11-26 03:30:12
Right, but BTC should be refunded.... their bank shut their account down so US dollars should be stuck.
BTC should be in cold storage.
@_date: 2013-04-18 20:50:09
i uninstalled google authenticator on my phone because i couldn't access block chain and forgot i had bitfloor.
@_date: 2013-04-03 16:46:29
did you do a manual wire transfer or an online transfer?
@_date: 2013-03-30 17:49:20
Depends which government I am.
In America, I would try to figure out the least damage it would do to us in terms of taxation.
In China, I would do what we've been doing with the internet and oversee everything.
@_date: 2013-04-03 01:49:14
the bitcoin price won't wait till the end of the week though!
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:39:21
What's your e-mail?
@_date: 2013-04-05 02:33:17
that's exactly how I think about it. you can wait for the price to drop, but if it goes up to 250 tomorrow and then drops to 180, then you'll regret it. 
you have to think about the long term success of bitcoins. p2p has government intervention, but it still exists, no matter what happens, bitcoins won't fall to 0.
@_date: 2013-11-06 17:37:58
Thanks for contributing nothing.
@_date: 2013-11-15 02:50:00
No one is claiming to be bitfloor. What can you lose? I don't even know what I could do with that information besides what I'm gonna do. Which is to gather up the information and try to come up with a plan..which I have.
@_date: 2013-04-05 16:30:24
right, the deflationary spiral. 
but i'm saying in practice, will that happen? like you said earlier, people still buy computers, tvs and cell phones well knowingly that something better will come out in 6 months from now.
@_date: 2013-04-04 22:03:40
Hey Eric, I'm still pretty worried. Mine hasn't gone through.
@_date: 2013-04-12 23:58:42
The fact that it works for some is scaring me.
@_date: 2013-11-08 16:43:09
please send me a SS of it with you trying to withdraw it and the date and time.
@_date: 2013-04-04 15:23:01
same, i hear they're having trouble with their wire transfers.. lucky us.
@_date: 2013-11-08 20:48:33
I've added you on the list
@_date: 2013-04-05 14:36:21
Then we move onto litecoins.. and if they do it again we move on to Bitcoin 2.0.. i mean are they really going to keep using resources to prevent us from using cash online?
@_date: 2013-04-18 15:19:50
scanned the barcode -_-
@_date: 2013-04-04 17:04:37
finally an informatively article on CNNmoney
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:05:24
ehh prob not, just like the rest of the community who didn't sell above 200
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:01:47
thanks, *whew* that was close :P
@_date: 2013-05-02 18:54:07
god damn troll.
@_date: 2013-11-15 17:01:05
Paid back in BTC or USD?
@_date: 2013-04-14 20:56:59
why do you think that is?
@_date: 2013-04-05 15:29:10
I think weekend dips are of the past.
@_date: 2013-11-26 01:25:52
A mix of bystander effect and people being selfish I suppose.
I really can't blame people though, sometimes you don't feel the gravity of the situation unless you're in it.
However, this issue should be resolved because it's important for consumers to have confidence in the services surrounding BTC for them to even use it. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 15:06:22
its' taking forever.
@_date: 2013-11-23 22:04:22
@_date: 2013-04-05 14:30:47
with the media calling it a bubble, a lot less people are going to take bitcoin seriously.. and if you really want it to be a choice of currency, people are going to have to take it seriously.
@_date: 2013-03-30 17:46:27
an exchange app that will let me see live prices that update every second.
preferably i should be able to choose which exchanges I would like to see.
@_date: 2013-04-17 22:39:00
wtf... i typed it in slowly i don't understand.. never had problems until after the crash.
@_date: 2013-11-02 18:24:18
I can't withdraw my BTC as well.
@_date: 2013-04-13 02:15:52
did you put a miner's fee?
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:37:07
Yeah, they're trying to prevent adoption by doing that. They saw coinmap and were like, "oh shit, we don't want merchants to adopt it, because it would be much harder to manage"
@_date: 2013-04-03 16:46:06
that's how i feel right now... IT KEEPS GOING UP!
@_date: 2013-11-15 00:17:50
When was it refunded?
@_date: 2013-04-05 01:55:22
playing devil's advocate.. it'd be very easy to profit off of it in the short term.
i am definitely pro bitcoins though :P
@_date: 2013-04-05 17:08:22
i'm saying in the scenario that BTC has stabilized.
@_date: 2013-04-05 16:21:42
i love the technology analogy, very nice.
@_date: 2013-04-13 02:18:00
1 btc?
@_date: 2013-04-05 15:19:26
go mine LTC
@_date: 2013-11-15 15:25:22
I don't see how you're making the comments you're making and then telling me you're owed BTC.
Please send me a screenshot to confirm you're not like what your username says.
@_date: 2013-03-30 19:06:59
more or less, yeah. I would use a google authenticator app on your iphone or android phone.
the safest way would to be to print out your code on a paper wallet, put it in a safe, dig a hole in the ground, on the opposite side of the world with a decipherable code only by your closest kin.
but with 2 bitcoins, i would just use google authenticator.
@_date: 2013-11-14 22:46:35
Got it.
@_date: 2013-12-17 18:28:04
Not all people want to spend all the money they have in BTC.
@_date: 2013-11-08 16:43:29
how many BTC do you have locked up?
please send me a SS of it with you trying to withdraw it and the date and time.
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:46:48
Easiest way to deposit USD into btc-e?
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:50:36
thanks =]
@_date: 2013-12-16 04:11:22
they're in there.
@_date: 2013-04-03 17:24:02
yeah... STILL WAITING, ARGHHGHGHGH
@_date: 2013-04-03 02:03:32
eastern time?
@_date: 2013-04-04 16:55:18
yeah, personal experience.. i think they just have an influx of transfers happening... i hope that is the case
@_date: 2013-04-04 16:56:41
do you foresee government intervention at all?
@_date: 2013-04-03 17:25:55
who cares if it is the standard currency?
@_date: 2013-04-05 02:24:15
but i also think that the fact that Fox even decided to put up a good representative to talk about bitcoins is uncanny. when you look at other media coverage of bitcoins, most of the representatives are not fit to talk on national tv.
@_date: 2013-04-04 22:08:04
yeah, I'm still sweating though, not as much as I was yesterday though
I will stop sweating when i see funds in my account, haha.
@_date: 2013-04-05 16:31:49
who knows, could be now! it's been at 130-140 range for 2 days now :P.. 
i guess that's up to speculation for whoever is using the BTC
for me, if the price remains the same for 2 months and I run out of USD, I will use BTC.. or if the price remains the same for 2 months and it's cheaper to use BTC, then I will use BTC
@_date: 2013-04-03 17:41:24
might be too many orders they can't handle? =/
@_date: 2013-03-30 14:39:47
First Read: What?
Second Read: What?
Third Read: I could've summarized that in 2-3 sentences.
@_date: 2013-04-03 17:17:46
it's like a manual transfer, you just fill out the details yourself.
@_date: 2013-04-05 15:11:44
it happens, at least you're not a pansy and delete what you said ;)
@_date: 2013-11-15 00:18:09
Did it withdraw?
@_date: 2013-11-08 16:44:17
please send me a SS of it with you trying to withdraw it and the date and time.

If you're a privacy nut, then you would probably want to take those precautions. It takes 5 minutes max to set up a new email account.
@_date: 2013-11-15 14:49:09
I will send an e-mail with a letter to all people that are owed BTC or USD.
I've already spoken to an attorney and was given one course of action that we could take.
@_date: 2013-05-02 15:06:59
I can't access my bf account because i uninstalled my 2nd auth, please help me resolve this problem.
i can provide whatever ID is necessary. will update when it gets resolved.
@_date: 2013-12-06 18:43:42
I'm working on a movement where we're owed over 600 BTC from Bitfloor since the shut down.
Is there anything you can do to help us?
@_date: 2013-04-03 21:36:26
The amount you deposit and they match it with the amount you request
@_date: 2013-03-30 14:41:47
If this is true, pretty cool.
But due to China's policies on the internet... I don't know if Bitcoins will be such a success over there.
@_date: 2013-12-17 00:26:37
Nah. I know. I'm a dick, but doesn't mean what I said isn't true.
@_date: 2013-04-26 14:41:08
Have they resolved this yet?
@_date: 2013-11-07 15:00:26
I can still see mine, are you sure you can't see yours?
@_date: 2013-12-06 18:59:36
Why would he BS about this? lol
@_date: 2013-11-15 23:22:13
PM me with how much and your e-mail address.
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:15:28
Please message me your e-mail?
@_date: 2013-04-03 17:04:59
i did the same thing.. actually i walked into there and did it.
online transfer is setting up with your online bank acct.
@_date: 2013-04-08 18:18:20
do you know what the rates are?
@_date: 2013-11-14 22:36:16
wwj710 please send me an e-mail with your reddit username.
@_date: 2013-04-04 15:10:47
did your transfer go through?
@_date: 2013-04-04 17:42:48
transaction fees
@_date: 2013-11-29 16:32:06
It's annoying that the mentality is not of the importance of crypto currency, but a get rich scheme.
I've made gains in both currencies, but it is important to realize why we're here to begin with, which is that value of money should not be controlled by any one government agent, but rather as a value given by society as a whole.
@_date: 2013-11-29 16:38:22
I never said that I only support Litecoin? But I can understand where you're coming from.
I do however believe that a huge majority of people who are buying BTC or LTC are for investment vehicles. Which is their right, and could be beneficial for the BTC or LTC economy. 
@_date: 2013-12-24 16:47:09
I agree.
@_date: 2013-04-04 22:06:20
I chose it because I've been using them pretty consistently.
They did e-mail me back saying that there are delays in wire and that everything will be processed when it's okay.
@_date: 2013-11-26 15:25:49
True. That I'm not sure of and that's what we're trying to find out.
