Yes. I know banks will still be around in 2025. But I think their fate is ultimately doomed at some future point. As crypto technology becomes more user-friendly/refined the need for banks will become less. 
People will ultimately decide. Holding funds in a bank and eaten away by inflation and negative returns, or holding an appreciating asset class with positive returns (PoS).
Every major technological advancement has changed/eliminated incumbents. I don't see why crypto won't eventually have the same effect on banks and money.

It makes more sense if viewed in this context: 


While the pizza (Bitcoin market cap) hasn't changed, it can now accommodate more people. Each able to take a smaller slice than was previously possible.

In 2025 my grand-kids will need those pieces of paper (fiat) explained to them. Like how today's kids don't fully understand cassette tapes, video tapes, CDs, DVDs, and the pre-internet age.
My hope is that they'll also ask: "grandpa, what's a bank?".

Maybe more than just Australia.

Are you talking about buying the copyright to that photo?
@_date: 2019-03-31 03:07:36
Yeah. Probably 100x current prices by 2030.

And cash is already a bygone era in many countries. Sweden is cashless. South Korea, China and UK are planning to be cash-free by 2020.
Cash is already almost extinct. Less than 8% of the world's money supply is in physical cash. The rest is held in a series of heterogeneous databases insecurely connected with high latency.

And they say Bitcoin is the bubble at ninety-two billion market cap (0.03% of global debt).

Nothing says "follow me home and torture me" more than this.

There's a lot more to tax residency than just the 183 day rule. You might want to get professional advice before trying this. Also many countries require you to pay capital gains on your assets when you stop being a resident for tax purposes.

Fixed it for them:

What's COKING?
@_date: 2019-04-02 09:21:29
Yeah, I can see them all scrambling to get a Coinbase account verified at about $40,000. Just in time to load up their credit cards at $50,000.
@_date: 2019-04-17 06:49:23
So if Bitcoin reaches 1% of global debt it'll be priced somewhere near $120,000 per BTC

That's an extreme punishment for a victim-less action.

The way I understand it, is there won't be a need to configure forwarding ports on your router.

What about bitcoin cash SV?
@_date: 2019-04-22 01:48:38
Honey. I'm going down to the Cryptomat. I need some funds cleaned.

In this case you will need "Double Strength HODL".

There's still the elephant in the room that you haven't mentioned. Do banks still have the ability to create new money to facilitate their current fractional reserve lending practices? If they do retain this position, what's to stop them abusing that power or laundering money, as they currently do?
Also, this new coin seems to have all the negative aspects of traditional banking, without any of the benefits of decentralization. People who are attracted to crypto won't be attracted to this new coin.

So now the crypto community supports violence against women/children?

I plan on first putting my three kids through college then retiring on the remainder of my 0.2198 BTC.
@_date: 2019-04-17 08:35:04
They all should be delisted. Except for BTC, of course.
@_date: 2019-04-17 08:29:14
I'd rather swap it for some BTC with some fool who thinks BCH has a future. A fool and their money ...

All I read is "Bitcoin Bull Signal".

Why not just cut out the middle man and buy me a lambo right now?

Just what the crypto community needs. A C-grade movie linking Bitcoin to money laundering and organized crime.
FYI - Always delete your 'kickbacks' folder before showing your laptop to an AML officer.

You're conditioned to believe that loans are a necessary component of a functioning economy. The truth is, creating money to give people loans creates more problems than it has ever solved.

Because it's mine and I want it.

Women get paid to masturbate on a webcam. Men get blackmailed when they masturbate on a webcam.

This is bad advice, and will most likely end in a lot of trouble for whoever follows it.
@_date: 2019-04-04 05:17:07
It's probably customized to you because you're viewing/searching for other crypto stuff. Don't assume everyone will see the same suggestions.

Do you really think Google doesn't use other ways to track you? IP address, language settings, browser version, operating system, screen dimensions, ... etc. They can get a pretty good fingerprint of who you are, even when you're not logged in and you've cleared your history.
I had the exact same issue on another forum. I asked others to compare their type-ahead suggestions with mine. Everyone had different results.

Maybe they've still got $900 million to go.

There's something blocking the view.

I suspect a lot less BTC than he used to. Probably dumped quite a few to support his SV fork price.
@_date: 2019-04-15 08:18:13
I don't think Bitcoin could be described as credit creation. It's more like we've created a unit of value that is not based upon another person's debt. 
Credit - the ability of a customer to obtain goods or services before payment, based on the trust that payment will be made in the future.

Should I fire up my C64 clone and mine some Bitcoin?

Sucking in all the fiat?

It's not very future-proof.  Not enough space for 6 figures.

Where's the best place to dump BCH? I still have a little I need to get rid of.
@_date: 2019-04-23 06:22:10
What paper? It's just digital stored on some antiquated database. They've made it virtually impossible to use any amount of cash over $10K.
@_date: 2019-04-04 14:02:56
And yet very few understand it.
