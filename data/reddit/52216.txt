You're wonderful people here. 
Perfect. I won't. 
I lurk, read every 2-3 days, aside from everyday + Andreas' writings, anything else worth reading for major news? Is coindesk.com good? 
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:47:55

1) Awesome!! Thank you! 
2) Perfect, I plan on holding overall.
Will do!! Does the gdax site have necessary info on trading costs and fees for the platform or would you recommend reading about it somewhere else? 
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:04:01
Is there a fee for pulling money out of gdax? Also is there any money to be made on gdax by trading? 
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:01:53
Any reason why, costs, security? 
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:46:03
Excellent, thank you for the advice!
