Edit: yes if you mean my private key/address to receive/deposit BTC to coinsquare yes I have access to that....

Okay thank you so much for helping me out. I appreciate you taking the time guys. Theres so much to learn with this stuff and I've been trying for the last half of 2017 to understand it but I still feel oblivious because of the insane amount of learning that's needed to navigate these things... It's really hard for new comers unfortunately.

Are you saying if I have my private key from coinsquare I can move monies to a platform that will allow me to transfer it without minimums?

....I am so lost... I think I need to do more research because I don't know what an Electrum wallet is ... I'm in over my head .... Also why I only put in a small amount

Okay so with my key I can relocate my money to a wallet and then transfer it to the exchange that I'm familiar with? (quadrigaCX)

Okay thank you for your help and warning, cause ya that would suck to get a fake and my tiny bit of coin stolen �� I already bought a little bit like $100 worth on coinBASE and then transferred it and the fee was almost half what I bought so like $40 and I'm just having trouble navigating this world so thank you again for helping a noob lol

I have the same trepidation as OP. I'm buying and using BTC like a stock and I love the idea of unregulated currency but i feel like I'm paying transaction fees and transfer fees above wjat regulated currency charges and I'm better off not moving my holdings and just investing and watching it grow like a stock. How is this suppose to take us away from regulated currency if it's unusable and expensive to transfer....
Edit: 
It's like one step forward and two steps back...

I don't know much about this stuff but I bought a small amount of crypto on Coinbase and then sent it to Quad because forums said I can withdrawal it to my bank account in Canada and my BTC LTC and ETH have been sitting there safely since unchanged so I know peeps say don't leave it on the exchange but it seems safer than most 3rd party wallet apps doesn't it? The exchange has multiple factor verification and app wallets are a sketchy 4 digit numerical pin so I dunno the exchange seems safer than wallet apps only thing I've seen that seems safer is those thumb drive like BTC wallets but I don't understand how you'd take your BTC off that and get it back into CAD or USD into your bank account.... honestly I just made a post asking the community about withdrawals from BTC back to CAD and how reliable it is or how trusted it can be cause I've never tried to withdrawal yet.... so sorry I'm not much help but I wish you luck and hope I may have helped a little my follow noob friend lol

Thank you a lot of how this works is still confusing to me but I understand what your saying :) cheers.

I'm no expert I'm honestly still trying to figure this all out here in Canada. But from what I read you can't withdrawal with coin base in Canada. I have some BTC and etherium and LTC on quadrica exchange because they give the option of withdrawing to Canadian accounts.... but I haven't tried it yet... from what I understand though Quadrica is your best option in Canada.

Easy. Because no one trusts the federal reserve. They'd trust a peanut more than the federal banking system.
