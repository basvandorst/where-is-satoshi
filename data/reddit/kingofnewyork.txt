No worries! Software looks solid. Nice work.

How so?

As always? Come on man.. 
Normally.. ah forget it, just take an upvote..

If you don't want to feel this way, absolutely do not move to NYC. Brooklyn is not at all what you are imagining here.

This will forever be a classic, no matter what happens with bcash. 
Thank you Roger Ver.

So let's say I invested all that I had, and that was say 2k. Two months ago. 
And say it's literally a lifeline. A last ditch.
And let's say that 2k has become 22k now. 
Is that still investing more than one can afford?
Do it right. Seriously, just do your homework and don't do it if it isn't right. Make sure, or don't. There are lots of coins that are most definitely headed for exponential return.
Just saying.

New buyers won't end soon. But there are many big owners already frothing at the mouth to manipulate this bull run.
Long term, of course this is low still.
Short term, be careful. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:49:43
That's great!

I'm hoping to cash out and buy property myself. Wise move. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:28:12
Not possible

Like the others have said. Basically a owner of a significant amount of Bitcoin can create what is called a sell wall.
For the price to rise 10k, while lets say the current price is 9k - If someone puts a 10000btc sell order in at 9.5k, that manipulates the market by keeping orders above it from being able to sell. Ultimately the buyers slow, and supply vs demand assures the price plummets. 
The end game being the manipulator uses the money made from the sell wall to buy the new lower price.

Unfortunately, I think you'll look back and regret much of this.

The coins can be run through a tumbler service, passing it between a series of addresses, in small increments and with other cryptocurrencies, making it a nightmare to track.

This is the truth.
Every dip, and even 50% is just a dip, is an opportunity. 
@_date: 2018-08-23 01:07:53
People want a reason to think they know “wen moon.” Simple as that. 
The truth is, I think, if the etf was approved there would be a massive selloff. 
“Sell the news” is about the only consistent market trigger I’ve seen in crypto.

This is good for bitcoin
@_date: 2018-08-15 01:50:55
A truly thoughtful post on the bitcoin subreddit? 
Thank you. 
@_date: 2018-08-23 00:12:58
Nobody expected it to pass, as far as I can tell. 
@_date: 2018-08-23 00:14:57
Ah. TBH Reddit is not a good place for reliable information, as a whole. 
@_date: 2018-10-29 17:43:25
Wow. What an awful costume. Nice work!

And how did you get his ip?

People who understand subtly know you’re an idiot.

This is not a straw man argument. 
It’s not even an argument. It’s a prepositional phrase. It’s a rhetorical question.

Dollars have traces of feces on them. Just wanted to mention that.

Don’t fomo in. It’s a trap.

I use both, and (surprisingly) CashApp has been the cheaper option the majority of the time.
@_date: 2019-06-21 23:25:06
You can not withdraw from Robinhood. You can only buy/sell. 
I had high hopes for Robinhood, but it’s no good if you want to hold bitcoin. It’s great if you just want to buy and sell.
@_date: 2019-04-02 18:38:17
This doesn’t make sense in this context. 
@_date: 2019-04-28 02:57:33
I got it from a comment above from someone who used a coinstar machine. I admittedly did not verify this. But it’s common to charge a fee- but also an arbitrage premium. Meaning they take the price and add a % to minimize loss potential during flash crashes. (Many apps do this as well- Ie, Cash App)
@_date: 2019-04-28 00:06:55
These are good for bitcoin name recognition and absolutely terrible for the consumer. The fees are ridiculous, and nobody is going to be making a profit anytime soon with &gt;12% fees.

This is like being in 1988 and people believed dial-in bbs was all the internet would ever be.

You don’t understand what an ETF is.
@_date: 2018-07-05 04:14:26
Nono, I’m “mouthing off.” I didn’t call you any names. 
Relax man. No need to get upset. Just pointing this out to you. I understand people don’t like being wrong about things. But you’re wrong.

Altcoins are tethered to ether, generally.  If ether goes up, altcoins go up by default.
If you care about altcoins, care about ether. Not bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-07-05 04:08:53
Sorry that you’re butthurt, that’s not my intention. Just pointing out the obvious. 
Your reasoning abilities regarding my understanding of bitcoin only further show this. 
This may be a useful read for you: 
In short, nobody buying into an etf is buying any bitcoin. It’s a fund, and you’re buying into a portion of it. You’re not buying bitcoin when you buy into a bitcoin etf. 
Have a nice day.
