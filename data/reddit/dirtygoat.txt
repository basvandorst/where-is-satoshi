Many of these wallets have been lost too

Lol he sounds like trump
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:57:10
This is my exact thoughts to the cause of the recent drop. This is what some of the main people realize and why Coinbase is fucking everyone.
Nobody wants to do the hard work to keep everything going. Everyone wanted to play but the ball pit was only so big lol the blockchain was getting overwhelmed. Coinbase and some miners are making money off the high fees, forcing people above a threshold. The whole slowdown creates a higher peak for people willing to pay but in turn loses interest to a harder fall from others willing to sell low....
But, btc it will continue rise like the roads and highways we build. Someone is in charge, just might not be the government we know today.

It will become a bunch of "banks" trading in organized batches.. Pretty much separate currencies. Their histories will determine the worth
@_date: 2018-01-09 18:43:41
Yes bitcoin will be abused too. It had not reached that level yet but honestly it will become the same thing as the currency we use today just a bit different. There will be tradeable physical cash that will be counterfeited and there will be banks that control large portions of btc and basically just follow fake numbers on a program as we do today with dollars
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:56:04
People abuse the systems. It can't be balanced
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:04:07
Yup. It's hard to replace btc basically because it was first to get to where it is and that takes a lot of time 
@_date: 2018-01-20 18:29:54
LN is a good system, but it is not the answer to all problems. It is only the first few of the many solutions that will come. 
There will be many systems like the LN around the world. Majorities of btc will pool to networks like this that only upload key transactions to the blockchain.. Everything will have to go backwards and prepare transactions similarly to usd that everyone accepts.. 
So no, even btc itself is not the ultimate solution as it cannot withstand the demand. Unless another better coin somehow attracts more users to become the ultimate one and only, all Crypto will just blend together along with current currencies for a big mess. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:02:24
The Chinese are stealing our usd
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:20:02
Thing I don't get is... Don't miners want high fees? Ik coin base is not a miner, but wouldn't it be obvious that big companies would actually want to spam the chain and force people to pay high fees? 
@_date: 2019-07-06 06:28:39
I didn't have enough money at 3k =(.. Literally put everything but my rent money in.. Started investing before the drop to 3k and soon as it dumped I was all in wish I put more tho =/ knew it would go up. This is pretty much letting us all know it's real, only up from here friends just buy in at the lows
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:31:14
There will be btc banks
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:43:58
Think about it, this gonna happen again... And again and again, probably.... Just with bigger numbers 
@_date: 2017-12-31 04:06:27
Still the fee tho. People talking about how it's going down but I still seem to pay a lot in fees on small shits.. But I guess that adds to the rise in value. 
@_date: 2018-08-18 01:08:07
Lmao really?? Dogecoin had more transactions than BCH?? Why the heck can't I but Doge on Coinbase haha! Fuck BCH! 
@_date: 2019-03-28 00:23:35
Banks can do whatever they want. Most large companies can too. This is 5 days worth of payments the company accumulates as "equity".
@_date: 2019-11-07 15:11:20
There's no stopping it, the whales are controlling the prices to their own benefit and shorting each coin as they please. I agree tho the common trader usually loses
@_date: 2019-11-08 04:39:04
good point. i guess in the end they will screw themselves too if they keep trying to trade but kinda sucks they are taking advantage of the current situation really putting a halt on btc's progression in some instances
@_date: 2019-11-04 19:03:22
If someone was trying to hide their transactions do you think they would categorize their payments as "illegal, non-retail" transactions?
@_date: 2019-11-09 17:56:43
1m in 20y, very unlikely. Btc won't be mined out for another 120y at which point it will prob max out. I don't think it can reach 1mil unless it becomes the main world currency which is also unlikely.. What we needed is variety and crypto as a whole gave this to us.. Maybe if nobody ever created ETH or XRP or BCH etc. but they have and they just like btc aren't going anywhere they will always take a portion of the crypto growth and variety will continue to spread
@_date: 2018-10-11 07:26:32
Oop. Time for a dump
@_date: 2019-10-25 20:40:27
Ok ty. So we prob have some room to grow... Maybe we'll reach 50k some day
It'll prob max at 100k cuz of how we work
@_date: 2019-10-26 01:27:37
Look again lol
@_date: 2019-10-24 21:26:26
If you look at the total value of btc it basically already dwarfs all the planet's value.. At 20k the value of all btc was about 300T which is (imo) impossible to maintain if everybody on earth had a share.. It only got that high because there were not enough sellers at the time and manipulation is real. If it goes to 50k that would make the total value almost 1Q... There is simply not enough money in the world to buy that much btc, basically would have to take over the world and create a new scale which.... Will not happen for 100y
Edit: honestly the best chance btc has for reaching 50k is if usd becomes worthless and the government continues to print it for personal gain
@_date: 2019-06-09 17:37:31
Sorry didnt read this fully but maybe it could help you
@_date: 2019-10-24 21:15:57
I've been realizing the same thing lately, it was a huge jump and the market value is literally (was) higher than the value of all money on earth.. It will not spike the same again unless literally manipulated to force it that high which it will only last a few hours before getting dumped back into the abyss.. Most people at this point who will ever know or hold btc already know and hold btc.. Everyone wants out for a profit and we are too early for it to become mainstream. If you wanna hold for 50+y then go for it but that's about how long it will take for you to be able to buy a house with it, legally.. The only way we can see such gains again is if the price drops back down to 4k over the next year but then it likely will never pass 15k as many newcomers will have joined the market and trading will be very high always dropping the price
@_date: 2019-06-09 17:24:59
It's no denying we need banks and loans to prosper as a society. The most important thing about crypto currency is that it cannot be duplicated or counterfeited. This makes us all equal and less likely to be victim of crash/deflation as no individual party has direct control over the currency.
We will always have banks and we want banks to exist or it would be extremely hard to advance without the help of loans and credit. Banks will still make money off interest, only difference is they cannot use our money behind the scenes without telling anyone as all the crypto can be clearly seen through blockchain.
If everyone today went to the banks and tried to withdraw all their cash there simply would not be enough cash, as much of it is gone due to criminal/fraudulent/misuse of the money.. Similar to gold and diamonds, we literally have more on paper than actually exists irl. Companies and crooks sell fake or overvalued gold while recording it on books as normal so it all accumulates fake growth. You would have to be the first person to withdraw all your money from the bank to get full value just like with bitcoin if everyone sold it the first person would get the most while the last person will be stuck with nothing left
@_date: 2019-06-09 17:00:05
Lmao $15
Good point tho
@_date: 2019-06-09 17:02:24
I'm still waiting for one more drop to invest my last bit
@_date: 2019-06-21 10:01:14
A lot more people are involved this time around. It may not drop so hard like the last time, I feel bad for people who bought at 17 and sold at 3k lmao... It was pumped to 17 by the big dogs but they are not as strong as they used to be. It's a good year to hodl
@_date: 2019-10-24 21:02:24
I've always made profit on drops by selling high and buying low. I barely look at the btc price anymore I just try to accumulate btc.. I'm sure everyone's mind in the same place
@_date: 2019-12-13 20:06:31
Hahaha =)
@_date: 2019-12-13 01:15:53
Looks like a $10 car
@_date: 2019-10-26 01:27:10
10% you say? For me it's showing 27
@_date: 2019-06-21 09:59:09
Yea I was just thinking about selling. It's prob gonna drop to around 9k and then blast to like 12
@_date: 2019-04-14 04:54:23
Lol? Tails on usb is like the last step if you are trying to go hard about being anonymous... Op is asking about buying bitcoin
@_date: 2018-03-01 20:11:59
Nothing has value.. Money isn't real. Our desires and wants are just a human emotion
@_date: 2018-03-23 18:54:07
Same shit is going to happen with bitcoin... People don't understand that bitcoin is not the solution. There almost is no solution to these problems we all live we all die. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 18:26:46
Total btc is about ~$300 Billion right now. If you had 300,000 BTC you would have about 1% of the total btc which is still not a whole lot. This 1% could influence the total price but not by much. I'd say 1% owner is def a whale, but I believe the largest pool is about 30-40% owner rn. 
@_date: 2018-03-22 16:01:28
8% seems high af... Of the 100 people I know, 0 know how to buy bitcoin
@_date: 2018-03-23 18:47:43
I also like to hold bitcoin with my foot
@_date: 2018-07-18 03:24:08
Lol watch it drops tmr... This is just a play by the big dogs to get more people to buy rn.
I'm waiting for the big drop
@_date: 2018-04-09 04:00:15
Because this takes 0 effort and maintenance right? I think most businesses have better things to worry about than learning how to keep track of new numbers and wallets.
Op is just saying that if square started to allow their customers to accept bitcoin it would open a huge market, allowing for much growth of bitcoin.
But as someone else stated it's not too likely as people would start to learn how to use btc and this would lower squares profits. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 16:21:24
That's because this earth is packed to the brim with humans.. Yea maybe 1000 years ago we would go hunt and stay busy trying to stay alive.. Even 200 years ago.. but now we are too cramped to even lift our arms no wonder people get fat and depressed there is literally nothing else to do.
Trust me, we need money and loans are a good thing. Maybe if you could convince 80% of the useless people out there to feed the ocean with their flesh the other 20% could enjoy this planet once again for a few hundred years until they overpopulate again.. We are beyond survival, now we are just lazy pigs in a pen doing w/e tf we want. Money helps us keep thing in motion through quick transactions.. People would literally starve to death if we had to wait to get paid in food after the labor was finished 
@_date: 2018-04-21 13:13:56
No it's not
@_date: 2018-04-06 01:33:29
Isn't it awesome? We have houses and roads and businesses and an economy thanks to it.. 
@_date: 2018-04-21 14:10:18
Check again
@_date: 2018-04-27 22:07:45
@_date: 2018-04-06 19:33:59
That's the thing tho, from experience I feel like it is possible to be too kind.. I help where I can but there is a line between helping those in need or just hurting myself by trying to help someone that doesn't really need it.. That's what sucks about money and why rich keep getting richer, a million dollars could make one person very happy for a very long time or it could give a million people a single cheeseburger.. It's hard to spread wealth knowing it has so much less potential the more people that are involved.
.. I'm rambling.
Bitcoin will go up. We have seen this past year its potential. As we talked about it is just another game but on a huge scale. If you are interested and have the time to, look into crypto trading rather than just hodling. At this point everyone knows about it and everyone wants in on the profits. Each spike will be bigger than the last until it reaches a plateau or crashes 100 years from now... Just another stupid game..
I can't say for sure but I think towards the end of summer we will see btc steady around 9-10k and next year around Christmas will be the next huge spike. Make sure you do have some coin in possession as there won't be much of a heads up during the spike lol.
If you haven't already, look into GDax. It is Coinbase's trading site between usd and btc. You can try to grow your pot before the upcoming waves. Btc is fluctuating daily and it's free money playing with numbers and watching the graphs.
Sorry for the rambling, it was a nice chat
@_date: 2018-04-06 18:04:06
Yea, I see what you're saying. And yes I do actually agree that this is the future but we had to go through an age of explosive evolution to get there, and it is thanks to the invention of currency.
I agree I believe there will be a world of eutopia with no worries and only fun/excitement so long as humanity can learn to be less greedy... But it is quite some time away and I think there will be some severe world wars before then. I still believe we face the problem of overpopulation, and for now we do need currency to keep things flowing smoothly and to literally control the masses. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 14:02:04
Most of us would be generally too lazy. There would be a select few who know how to farm and support themselves and a few around them but without money most of us would not bother to do anything for anybody else
@_date: 2018-04-06 18:53:19
I honestly enjoyed this conversation and like your points of view. I do agree with much of what you said.
I may have came off cruel but in person I am also a good guy looking for the best of those around me.
I just come from a different perspective I think this world is pretty fucked up rn and there is not much we can do until something very bad inevitably happens..
Just to finish the topic of money I agree it sucks and I like the perspective you just showed me. But I know for a fact money is a powerful tool that for the most part has helped us advance in history. But yea it really sucks that everything has turned into a competitive game of points.. For the longest time I've also been on this page and honestly my dream has always been to run away with a few close people to somewhere we can just live in peace and work to improve each other without worrying every moment if we will be "successful" enough to have a fulfilling life and if I can even support a family... =/ man this world is pretty messed up right now and I don't believe it will get much better in our lifetime
@_date: 2019-05-12 12:40:06
Still have time, it's expected to reach 50k this time around
