I failed to see your point here.
Are you saying that we are supposed to be grateful that BTC was built on CP and hitman ads? No, just as nobody should feel guilty that fiat money is being used by both charities and terrorists.
If BTC could not exist without SR, then it's a failed concept anyway. What kind of strong currency is that?

I never mentioned drug in my post. What I disagreed with the OP of this thread is the subject matter of CP and hitman ads on SR.
Please note that I wrote "sometimes" and "most of the times", not every time.

Some drug should be legal. Others should not.
And that was not my point anyway.

Are you denying the FACT that SR did have CP and hitman ads? Because I know SR did, and I had seen them with my own eyes on SR.
This is the reason why I'm one of those who supports BTC but at the same time 100% condemns SR and DPR and, as an extension, OpenBazaar. He provided a platform for all those kinds of things. It doesn't matter that those terrible things would have existed without him. He went out of his way to HELP them thrive.
Are you going to sit here and debate how the good and the bad DPR did offset each other? Because in my book, if you help spread CP, you deserve to go to jail.
Most of the times, things are not black and white. But sometimes, they should be.

Not my point. Not going to argue with that.

One of Bitcoin's most noted advantages is its ability to transfer money between locations with little to no fee.
My question is: What good is this feature if I send Bitcoin to my relative in, say, Cambodia and there's no way for them to exchange those Bitcoins to Cambodia's common, usable currency?

So, because an artist only gets a small cut of what you pay them, you decide to get their stuffs while... not paying them any money.
Yup, that sounds absolutely fair to the artists.

Calling bitcoin users stupid is very arrogant.
Do you know exactly how your car works? How about your fridge? Your plumbing system? Your air-conditioner? Your TV? Yet, you still use them, right?
No one can know everything. No one can or should be expected to learn about how everything works in their lives. You pick what you think is best for you. 
Does a web developer call you stupid because you don't know how to program? Does a car mechanic call you stupid for not being able to fix all your car's issues? Does a doctor call you stupid for not knowing how blood cells work?
So you know how bitcoin work better than most. Good for you. Now go and use that knowledge for good. Calling other people stupid is not good.

It's the freedom software crowd's typical stance. Almost any criticism over bugs or lack of features will eventually lead back to "The source code is there. Fix it yourself!"
The mentality that every user of a piece of software should also be a programmer and be qualified enough to fix their own softwares is just, well, ignorant and misguided.
Common users don't submit code to fix free software. They just switch to paid options.

And developers are not cheap.
Look, more often than not, this type of discussion occurs when a business owner is being convinced into using freedom software instead of an existing paid option.
So, to a business owner, the choices are:
- Hire internal developer(s) to fix and add features, which:
            + Has opportunity costs. The developers cannot work on his usual jobs.
            + Takes time (weeks at least), during which your business is being hindered.
            + Has a chance of development failure.
- Pay external developer(s) to fix and add features, which will:
            + Cost hiring money.
            + Takes time (weeks at least), during which your business is being hindered.
            + Has a chance of development failure.
- Buy this closed-source softwares that do what they need and get it running in a week at most.
This argument gets even worse for freedom softwares when the cost of paid softwares is low to medium. For example, MS Office costs less than 100 bucks per year for personal use. What developer will work for you at that rate?
In this case, you are asking OP's boss to pay to fix a system that 1/ Will cost him money to fix and maintain, 2/ He has no faith in yet. Any rational people who is not already a bitcoin advocate will refuse such a proposition.

1/ I see inherent deal-breaking problems in a product, and...
2/ I have no stake in that product's success yet.
The most rational decision is simply not use it, which was exactly what his boss did.

Yes, It usually is. In fact, I dare say that most consumer-grade freedom softwares came to be simply to replace paid ones (Linux, Gimp, OpenOffice, Krita, etc). The EFF keeps an ongoing list of paid softwares that need replacing.


"better" is subjective and relative. There's a concept of being "just good enough". And a user needs many things from a software, not just one. OS X is worse than Linux at certain things (open, customizability, etc) but it's better in others (UI design, user-friendly, online services, etc), so some people choose it.
Still, I'm not arguing for paid softwares. I'm arguing against the argument that "Fix it yourself" is a valid recommendation. It's not.

Why? People have a problem that you can solve, so you ask for money in return. Blame Bitcoin for being hard to buy outside of the US
