Can somebody place a link where I can read it without signing in?

Sell the rumour, buy the news
@_date: 2018-01-29 20:44:47
There is also a possibility they charge more for deposit and withdraw just like okcoin did a couple of years ago
@_date: 2018-01-21 07:53:44
40k march. 100k spike December 
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:27:03
IT IS JUST A CORRECTION. it happens all the time to bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:47:37
It's called a bear market. Bitcoin was in a bear market for two years
@_date: 2018-01-25 20:07:40
20% it goes to zero. 50% it will work. What about the left 30%?
@_date: 2018-01-23 20:40:53
Because they don't pay tax
@_date: 2019-07-17 07:34:01
WoW this man knows
@_date: 2019-07-20 18:38:13
So when moon?
@_date: 2019-07-02 09:20:27
Which means from your graph it is going to be sideways for about a year
@_date: 2019-07-28 12:35:06
Not really
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:24:25
Whats up with the links to unlock key?! O my, so much effort, so much BS
@_date: 2019-07-02 09:18:38
I’m still waiting for a partnership between ledger and Apple or Samsung. I would like to see the ledgerdevice being incorporated into the phone
@_date: 2019-07-02 11:48:48
What I’m curious about is how governments are going to tax their citizens....?
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:42:46
What about I just give you the money for nothing in return?
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:31:55
Thinking the same
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:07:20
Markets are random walks. There is no underlying structure moving it. In the long run it's al just noise
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:32:00
Ok, so you're saying they are not able to sell bitcoin to go in line with their shorts? That's just naive.
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:54:05
Yes, I overlooked previous answer
@_date: 2018-09-10 11:30:20
It's irony
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:39:04
Me please
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:09:50
Every individual can buy bitcoin. This is manipulation. But they don't care.
@_date: 2017-12-02 08:42:13
All or nothing

You guys don't read what he is saying. He is willing to sell his own bitcoin to someone else for 1MM.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:03:55
This metaphor gives me courage����
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:41:51
Ok, what is your prediction then?
@_date: 2018-09-14 09:41:20
The cnbc negative indicator is in particular really Interesting. 95% of the time correct
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:44:38
Wait until Sunday's futures launch
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:21:07
Probably Sunday when futures launch
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:50:44
Please don't do stupid things
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:58:09
You think iota is a shitcoin?
@_date: 2018-09-14 08:54:01
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:36:17
How can you be certain they don't have bitcoin? Everyone with a computer can buy them and nobody will know. How do you explain all the FUD around these futures then? I've got the paranoid feeling big boys are pumping the price to let it crash when futures start.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:37:47
Blockfolio. O wait, you can add all other coins on bitcoin ticker as well
@_date: 2018-09-15 13:06:26
Yes, I imagine a long boring time ahead. Sideways and after a long time slowly up
@_date: 2018-09-11 11:23:49
But it doesn't 
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:51:48
Except when honey badger gets beating with a steel rod on his head 
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:48:24
Does this mean you have to pay about $50 every month to broadcast it to the blockchain?
@_date: 2018-09-03 20:57:02
Ok, that evens the tension
@_date: 2018-09-03 20:51:45
I read somewhere this ratio is manipulated by a big player who plays against himself tricking the market
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:08:25
Satoshi is that you?
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:29:12
Bitcoin is unregulated territory .
@_date: 2018-09-10 11:35:19
I've been a while in crypto and the negative state (bearmarkets) lasts much longer than your emotions can handle. So probably we are still some time away from a bull run.
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:57:21
So you're saying big players have caused this bullrun to get the value up until futures will be available. Then they will bet with their futures that the price will go down. They have the real bitcoins to sell. Price will go down. They make money with their futures. Sounds logical but scary. Am I right?
@_date: 2018-08-15 20:47:28
I love reading 0.17, because it suggests it is not ready yét.
@_date: 2018-08-07 22:21:49
Etf decision postponed intil September 
@_date: 2018-05-06 20:41:13
Sure. Search for long/short squeeze.
@_date: 2018-08-21 21:17:10
Curious as well
@_date: 2018-08-20 20:51:58
Just sell it if you feel like it
@_date: 2018-05-06 20:11:54
Markets tends to rek the most people as possible. So if more people are long. The price goes down and viceversa.
@_date: 2018-05-06 15:34:42
I understand you. It was a correction, but I sense a lot of people are so bullish now it must go down again meaning when looking back a year from now we can conclude it was a bearmarket after all
@_date: 2018-05-06 15:30:26
Who says we are going up from now on? Maybe this is just a bounce before going back to 6k
@_date: 2019-03-31 07:14:38
You forget the upcoming recession
@_date: 2019-03-07 10:10:53
This commandline stuff again makes me realise we are so far away from adoption.
@_date: 2019-03-07 21:03:09
Funny you need to know to much about bitcoin and crypto to even safely use it. Adoption is far away
@_date: 2019-03-05 21:46:43
Two major dutch banks are also involved
@_date: 2019-03-07 21:01:01
Mom must say “bitcoin dead, right?” Before bottoms in
@_date: 2019-03-05 07:15:49
Also happend in the Netherlands with two major banks. They laundered money for Russia
@_date: 2019-03-04 22:16:00
This is also my main concern about crypto at this point in time. It is way to difficult and risky for most people to understand how to use it. For this reason I feel we have a long way to go. People trust banks more than themself’s when it comes down to money. Most people don’t want the hassle. There is a paradigm shift needed and this in turn needs a catalyst. An easy and friendly looking app may be one of them, but only when these scary privatekeys are not shown anymore, but instead a name or something, so the numbers do their job under the hood.
@_date: 2019-11-04 07:37:48
Tom lee has a full of shit
@_date: 2018-10-16 13:40:44
It goes back in time and repeat?
@_date: 2019-03-21 07:13:04
@_date: 2018-10-17 19:54:49
When believing this graph, never
@_date: 2018-10-07 16:12:39
@_date: 2019-10-29 10:49:35
Or the day after tomorrow, or never. It’s a catch 22. First you want btc to go to a million dollars. Then the price swings don’t matter that much. But for that price to happen you want adoption which is equivalent to buying btc but not spending it which is not adoption of using btc but investing in the hope its going to be used. We are stuck.
@_date: 2019-08-12 21:36:33
I’m afraid you are right
@_date: 2018-06-24 08:28:21
Means bottom is in sight
@_date: 2019-10-04 09:32:13
Sell low
@_date: 2019-10-09 12:40:22
Oh god, no
@_date: 2019-10-09 12:39:01
It could be a huge whale who can manipulate the price to whatever he wants
@_date: 2019-10-11 07:37:16
When not regulated there is no solution to market manipulation.
@_date: 2019-08-05 21:52:33
Now can you imagine bitcoin being a million dollars and at the same time worth nothing because of dollar devaluation
@_date: 2019-10-25 12:42:12
But buying stocks is also discouraged by paying more taxes above a certain amount so people keep more money on their bankaccount. It all just sucks
@_date: 2019-08-16 06:10:37
Both going down so stfu
@_date: 2019-06-25 07:38:00
Look up the definition of asymptote
@_date: 2019-06-02 21:02:37
This is actually a very smart move for him to make if BTC will not reach the goal.
@_date: 2019-06-24 21:46:28

@_date: 2019-02-19 18:19:40
Sentiment is to positive&gt; prepare for impact
@_date: 2019-06-29 14:42:37
Bullshit. If your pockets are that deep, you don’t talk about it on reddit.
@_date: 2019-06-19 21:34:45
I’m tired of waiting though
@_date: 2019-02-16 21:33:19
I tried, but doesn’t work.
@_date: 2019-02-23 08:57:58
@_date: 2019-02-16 08:33:23
And what’s $0.01? 0.01 sat? Is that even possible? More likely 1sat= 1$cent
@_date: 2019-06-23 22:49:44
I’m glad you say bitcoin is going to be stable at 1MM. I think the same. Price fluctuation has less impact on lower amounts and that’s when it is usable.
@_date: 2019-02-22 22:16:00
Buy and hold
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:46:34
Deconnect to the internet. Put down your info. Reconnect. Send

How do I withdraw to BlueWallet?
@_date: 2019-06-25 14:58:29
And that we are doomed
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:01:01
Or not, because thats the general sentiment
@_date: 2019-06-24 16:36:35
When I follow this graph, it will never reach a million dollar per bitcoin because of asymptote
@_date: 2019-06-29 14:32:44
Yup, top reached; going down
@_date: 2017-11-25 20:20:59
I didn't knew bitcoin had a marketing department
@_date: 2019-02-06 21:36:19
Just a thought: would it be possible and good to have your own lightningnode on your Phone in the future?
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:14:44
I seriously don't know
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:02:28
Good for you man! Buy a nice car. Do whatever you always wanted to do. Go on a trip around the world for a year. Buy a boat. Go on dates with girls in fancy reastaurants. Buy them expensive champagne haha
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:52:42
Nice try
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:16:23
Confirmed and going down as expected. FOMO buyers panic sell
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:16:41
I used to like kraken..
@_date: 2019-06-19 11:56:52
No, only pay for goods with bitcoin. Not converting to fiat
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:26:33
I don't think so. Only if you buy property or a fancy car.
@_date: 2019-06-14 22:44:42
Sure, where to send it to? For 1 dollar worth of bitcoin I would like $352.974.678. Dont close the comments fucker.
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:07:50
Strange isn't it. Why does the mind always search for things to feel bad about oneself. I've got the same feeling as yours. When bitcoin was back at 300 I asked myself should I buy a lot. I didn't, because I lost before. When I look back now I should have bought all I could. But it would not give you peace of mind at night. These new ath lately give me also restless nights I must say. It's never good.
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:20:44
Live a little man. Life's to short. Enjoy what money can buy. And if not, just put it aside and buy a house when you're ready for it when you have find/bought ;) a girlfriend
@_date: 2019-02-19 18:14:34
Interesting. How much does a node costs and how much electricity does it use. Do you personally have influence on routing 10.000 a month and is that a high number o could it be higher (in the future). All these questions come done to one: is it lucrative to run your own node.
@_date: 2017-11-24 21:23:31
More important question: where does your hate comes from?
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:50:30
Kraken no major issues. Just as usual have to refresh a couple of time and put your order multiple times. Nothing new.
@_date: 2019-06-30 19:07:01
They must be rich AF
@_date: 2017-11-21 13:48:17
What I am curious about is if it is possible for bitcoin to implement the tangle principle because Lightning seems still inferior to the tangle.
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:00:10
I had the same issues for over a year. When I do make a transaction/trade I just keep refreshing or repeating all steps multiple times. Eventually it will go through. I'm glad I withdrawn my btc a week ago. Hope my method still works for other people. Stay strong.
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:00:33
I'm seriously shouting to the graph on my phone to calm down
@_date: 2019-06-27 09:46:24
Yup, fomo buyers confirmed.
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:45:22
Do not sell
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:30:39
I'm scared
@_date: 2019-06-25 14:12:20
What if bitcoin is at the little bump from 1987?
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:03:35
I got a lot of people in the company I work into crypto. Every time at lunch it feels like giving lectures. I'm happy to do so.
@_date: 2019-12-26 15:18:39
Hear hear. He was the first to look for in the list. Now I’m truly angry and spreading antipathy against YouTube.
@_date: 2019-12-26 15:17:08
Google (YouTube) is up to something. I’ve got the feeling they are developing themselves a cryptocurrency. Anyway, I think this could lead to a decentralised video platform just like Twitter is developing a decentralised social platform.
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:19:27
But when they are not buying or selling bitcoin directly how does it influence price?
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:05:54
Yes, that page showed up with me to. I just kept going until it worked.
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:10:55
I want to believe but never imagined it going this fast. It's not ready to be used by the masses jet. It's to user unfriendly and I'm afraid adoption is to soon.
@_date: 2019-06-21 10:08:30
I’m afraid you’re right. MtGOX inspired.
@_date: 2019-04-10 07:11:08
In another thread he says he has 1/20 of his stash spend on this car....
@_date: 2019-02-07 10:49:11
WoW thanks! How do I withdraw the tip to BlueWallet? Sorry, I’m such a noob.

@_date: 2019-04-24 17:12:15
This sounds so conplicated. Adoption is far away
@_date: 2019-04-24 17:55:30
Seriously. All these buzz-words. The average Jo has no idea what you are talking about. Indeed. The technicals must be work under the hood
@_date: 2019-04-03 20:19:36
@_date: 2019-04-03 20:18:47
Off course it is manipulation but who cares!
@_date: 2019-04-01 19:24:30
Listen to this: If one bitcoin is in the magnitude of 100k to 1MM a sudden drop or surge in price doesn’t matter for the value of your coffee. We just have to wait a bit.
@_date: 2019-04-11 08:19:42
Lambo’s are so juvenile

@_date: 2018-03-22 19:25:18
After we go up?
@_date: 2018-11-24 21:31:01
God, is that you speaking?
@_date: 2018-03-30 14:22:53
Exactly what you say. Could be a fake wall. Could be support. Could be to manipulate price upwards.
@_date: 2018-03-26 20:52:34
Sell low, buy high.
@_date: 2019-01-06 22:06:39
@_date: 2018-03-27 09:42:27
I just like to think the universe is indifferent and nothing has value. What you're talking about is practical value, which is different from intrinsic value, I think.. In the end it's all semantics and meaning. You are right, I am right, that's all right. We can have our own opinions. I understand what you are are saying. I value your opinion;)
@_date: 2018-03-30 15:00:10
I don't understand what you're trying to say
@_date: 2018-11-18 16:51:09
Lol, as the end is approaching his prediction is lowering
@_date: 2019-01-29 20:18:39
O my, could it be..major Exchanges closing down. Crypto to zero. Experiment failed. 
@_date: 2019-01-22 20:54:40
That’s what I’m wondering. If you’re not able to buy from the bank itself it will be to difficult for most people to buy elsewhere.
@_date: 2019-01-13 17:46:41
@_date: 2019-01-02 19:02:43
What about Bitfinex? Can you trust them? Honest question?
@_date: 2019-01-10 11:16:12
Price will hoover for months around these numbers with pumps and dumps. This is nothing disturbing, just natural movement of price at a bottom
@_date: 2019-01-27 21:39:25
@_date: 2018-11-19 21:37:26
I’m def buying when it hits 3k
@_date: 2018-02-12 19:14:49
Google glass
@_date: 2018-03-27 09:16:31
You don't understand my philosophical statement
@_date: 2018-02-28 07:55:12
I always seen Bill Gates as an intelligent man. Now, I'm not that sure anymore
@_date: 2018-11-24 22:52:14
I’m seriously eager to start buying again and I’m sure I’m not the only one.
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:30:15
I was literally shaking when I checked my portfolio in Blockfolio. The price on their website is normal.
@_date: 2018-02-25 12:54:40
When (now the sentiment is pretty bearish) and why?
@_date: 2018-02-28 17:55:26
Yes one of the biggest
@_date: 2018-02-03 21:51:51
The same guys who started Bitfinex, started the tether company which was leaked through the panama papers. Make your own conclusion.
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:52:08
I thought maybe 5k, but now the Dow is crashing I start feeling more optimistic for crypto because people may seek shelter there, especially because crypto is at such a low value now
@_date: 2018-02-25 12:52:22
Why? And why are you so sure?
@_date: 2018-03-26 21:35:06
Gold has no intrinsic value either. Nothing in the whole universe has intrinsic value. We, mankind, gives value to anything it finds valuable. Look at art. 
@_date: 2019-09-16 06:38:48
Please stop shouting
@_date: 2019-09-16 07:17:09
Yes, good idea. Using tiny letters to whisper
@_date: 2018-07-16 21:01:27
So just like I said. Bullish or bearish. Up or down. Whatever direction
@_date: 2018-07-16 21:12:40
Buy the rumour, sell the news
@_date: 2018-07-31 10:21:35
So elaborate and profound
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:10:32
What did come out of his mouth?
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:51:11
Remember CBOE futures in 2017? That exact bearmarket had started.
@_date: 2018-07-20 14:07:10
Wait for the moment btc price plummets and alts rise..
@_date: 2018-04-04 20:04:28
This is not the time to buy, it will go lower
@_date: 2018-04-05 18:52:53
Very nice! The feeling I have when seeing al this digital and code like text adoption it far away in the future
@_date: 2018-04-15 07:41:22
Which is now, uh..oh
@_date: 2018-04-04 21:32:29
Bottom could be between 4-6k. Miners are going to be tested. But after that a massive bounce back to these price levels I suppose. But hey, no one knows for sure.
@_date: 2018-04-05 20:46:40
Calm for the storm
@_date: 2018-04-12 15:08:33
This is what's called a short squeeze.
@_date: 2018-04-14 20:16:33
Recession just around the corner
@_date: 2018-07-16 19:29:01
Omg he is seriously saying bullish or bearish. LOL 
@_date: 2019-05-01 18:00:57
Not this again
@_date: 2019-05-12 18:53:24
It is still a realistic possibility
@_date: 2018-12-20 21:58:00
These developments make me give back faith in the future of bitcoin and realise bitcoin is here to stay and will be used as a way of payment globally in the future. This is so promising. It makes all the big newspaper FUD articles about bitcoin going to zero worthless.
By the way. The UX is so smooth
@_date: 2018-12-14 22:14:38
You sound scared. The bears got you where they want you
@_date: 2019-05-10 08:36:03
Wait for it...
@_date: 2018-12-14 21:59:16
Relax, it will go up eventually. Just a year more bearmarket and than up again. Same old boring story.
@_date: 2019-05-06 22:29:45
Not this again
@_date: 2018-12-15 08:02:05
No, just hodl and buy more when the mood is changing
