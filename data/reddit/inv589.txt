That's exactly why democracy was invented, to correct for the "nature of power". What you are describing is a world where the royals and the rich people can do whatever they want, leaving everyone else powerless.
@_date: 2015-06-01 17:41:23
What they need is to build a coin that's truly decentralized and democratic, i.e. each citizen has 1 vote, without the ability to build mining farms that centralize power.

There are many exchanges in the US, such as Coinbase, itBit, coinsetter, etc.. These are regulated and obligated to respect the customer's funds, so you don't need to worry.
Why would you move money to any Chinese exchange in the first place, where you have zero consumer protection?
@_date: 2015-06-28 21:30:45
you are exactly right. bitcoin is private money. the core developers control it.
@_date: 2015-06-21 23:00:50
An exchange that offers excessive leverage to their clients has the risk of going out of business if there is a large jump in the price before they are able to liquidate all positions. Look what happen to FXCM when EUR/CHF had a huge jump this year.
To me, this is an additional reason to avoid those exchanges.

Do not underestimate wall street and their billions and political connections.

Regardless of the technical details, the real question here is: Are hard forks allowed going forward in bitcoin or not?
So, to that I say: Let the hard fork happen and see if the free market of miners and users likes it. If they don't like it then they are free to not mine it and not use it or even create altcoins that satisfy their interests.
PS. Not to mention that Satoshi performed many hard forks in the first years of bitcoin. Why not allow Gavin to do a few more when he thinks it's necessary?
@_date: 2014-09-09 03:42:41
Well, with bitcoin you won't have to fill any paperwork, since once they are stolen, they are stolen forever and you can't do much about it. At least with credit cards you can have limits and most credit cards have pretty sophisticated fraud-detection systems that limit the damage.
@_date: 2014-09-08 17:28:22
complete nonsense
@_date: 2014-12-17 14:04:52
Why don't you buy some to stop the decline?
@_date: 2014-10-14 01:50:44
yes, agree
@_date: 2014-09-06 14:15:55
what if the hardware fails, or I lose it?
@_date: 2014-09-09 14:13:31
but they don't give you a 2% discount when you pay with bitcoin. that's my point
@_date: 2014-09-04 01:12:55
The exponential growth has slowed for now.
@_date: 2014-10-11 20:22:29
That sounds great, however there is a 30 minute window where bitcoin volatility can play a big role. The bitcoin price doesn't move much in 30 minutes in most cases, but there is no guarantee.
Why can't Circle and Volabit collaborate to completely eliminate volatility risk?
@_date: 2014-09-17 14:25:40
Just give it a few more years and we'll get there
@_date: 2014-10-23 21:29:30
Agree, but that's exactly my question. In other words, is it reasonable to expect cost-effective payments when the payment amount is below $1?
@_date: 2014-10-21 15:52:25
Do you think bitcoin can be a good solution to micropayments without significant changes to the protocol?
@_date: 2014-10-27 20:17:43
That's what I'm trying to figure out. It would be nice to start a business based on bitcoin that competes and beats all credit card companies in the US.
@_date: 2014-09-08 23:27:04
Just copy paste it. This is not a good attitude towards someone who wants to learn more about bitcoin.
Do not assume that everyone understands everything about bitcoin. If that were the case, the usage wouldn't have remained so low.
@_date: 2014-10-27 20:15:35
It's ok to lose money initially, but if you end up becoming Facebook or Twitter then it's worth it.
@_date: 2014-10-21 16:10:09
Living in the US, I feel like there are not enough incentives to pay with bitcoin at the moment. For example, bitcoin requires some dollar fee to acquire and the price can go down by the time I want to buy something with it. In addition, the merchants do not give cash back or points when paying with bitcoin, while credit cards do.
Is bitcoin a better deal for the merchants but not so much for the consumers, and what needs to change for more consumers to adopt it?
@_date: 2014-10-27 00:23:32
In the bitcoin world, a lot can happen in two minutes. Plus, you have additional bid/ask fees as I mentioned. How do you know that Bitpay will be using the same rate as Circle did when you bought the coins?
And even in that case, what about point 3) ?
IMO, what we need is an end-to-end solution where you "Pay with Circle" or "Pay with Coinbase" and you just get more cash back compared to how much a credit card would give you. Bitcoin would just be in the background, the consumer simply doesn't care.
@_date: 2014-12-16 04:53:36
Do you work for Changetip and want to promote the company?
Introducing phrases such as "change tipped" is the ultimate way to promote the company.
One of the reasons Google is still so dominant is because people still always say "I Googled it, just Google it, etc..", so if you convince people to make your company name part of their language then they are actually much more likely to user your service.
@_date: 2014-11-09 15:31:03
@_date: 2014-10-27 00:19:54
Even outside the USA, you can probably still pay with cash upon delivery when you buy a physical good, with almost no fees.
I find the political arguments very interesting, but very few people will accept to pay a lot more in fees just to satisfy someone else's political arguments.
@_date: 2014-09-09 16:51:08
Not sharing your private keys is a major advantage for sure. However, most existing wallets are still not as easy to use as credit cards. Especially, for local transactions.
@_date: 2014-09-09 03:48:24
I agree with that. My point is more about still not seeing enough progress when it comes to ease-of-use for the consumer.

He looks like a smart and knowledgable guy and his criticism is very valid for the most part.
@_date: 2014-09-09 03:40:02
that's not the best way to convince someone to start using bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-09-08 23:22:33
What is the answer?
@_date: 2014-10-26 22:42:21
I just gave you the actual numbers. What do you not understand?
Even when you buy with Circle, points 2) and 3) still hold.
@_date: 2014-10-27 20:17:10
I still don't understand why credit cards are more competitive in price, given how much better bitcoin is technologically.
Shouldn't bitcoin-based solutions be a lot cheaper than credit cards?
@_date: 2014-09-17 01:47:18
so we can all get rich!
@_date: 2014-09-11 21:04:32
This is actually good news.
@_date: 2014-09-23 11:26:30
The timing is great now that bitcoin price is falling, so getting rid of them quickly makes it a good move.
@_date: 2014-09-09 16:51:24
looking into it, thanks for the tip
@_date: 2014-10-07 19:06:07
"Most people" are only familiar with checking and savings accounts where your balance doesn't go down just because.
@_date: 2014-12-17 05:51:25
definitely very good for the planet 
@_date: 2014-09-08 22:26:28
Yes, everyone wants to accept bitcoin, but that's not news.
The real question is why me as a user would want to pay with bitcoin? When I pay with credit card, I get 2% cash back. When I pay with bitcoin I have to pay Coinbase 1% fee and I get zero cash back. In addition, I need to make sure the price of bitcoin hasn't moved between the time I bought them on Coinbase till I make the purchase. It's just a complete no-brainer that I should use my credit card whenever I can, instead of bitcoin.
And just to clarify, the businesses are not really accepting bitcoins, they are only accepting them temporarily so they can immediately convert 100% into dollars.
@_date: 2014-09-09 03:39:24
What about 2014?
This 100 mil with bitpay in 2013 is just bitcoin early adopters who bought bitcoins for 5$ each and were cashing out once price went to $1000.
@_date: 2014-09-06 14:16:07
both are extremely inconvenient 
@_date: 2014-10-30 00:24:20
Great job guys!
@_date: 2014-10-05 16:06:48
Having to check every time if the money is there is extremely inconvenient. I'd rather use paper dollars instead.
Plus, there is no guarantee that the creator of those wallets hasn't made a copy of the private keys somewhere else before they give it to you.
Paper wallets of this kind are unsafe and need to be discontinued/discouraged!
@_date: 2014-09-05 23:58:22
it's pretty hard for me to understand all the different ways to do it. how do you store yours?
@_date: 2014-11-12 15:39:51
you made this?
@_date: 2014-10-28 23:01:14
@_date: 2014-10-21 15:57:55
Do you think it's possible for bitcoin to succeed as a payment system if the bitcoin price doesn't stay above $1000 ?
@_date: 2014-09-08 23:37:14
These are all investment accounts from speculators hoping to get rich. Usage in terms of payments is still very low.
@_date: 2014-10-11 15:34:39
When I first read about bitcoin I said that it was never going to work, because I thought there is NO WAY the blockchain will be able to remember ALL transactions that EVER happened in the network. Even if storage and bandwidth get cheaper every year, there will always be a few bad actors that will try to overbloat the blockchain with lots of transactions and make it uneconomical to rely on a single blockchain.
The way I see it working in the long term is to have many different blockchains that are app specific and not a single generic bitcoin blockchain. And that probably means that bitcoins themselves will be worthless in a few years.
@_date: 2014-10-01 16:23:23
I would have liked to but it's more expensive and less convenient compared to using my credit card. I get 1-3% cash back with my credit card, but with bitcoin I actually get no cash back and I also have to pay to buy them. In addition, the bitcoins I bought last month have already dropped in value by more than 10%, so effectively I would have to lose 10-15% of cash to make a purchase with bitcoin, while I get 1-3% when using a credit card. There is no contest here.
@_date: 2014-10-05 16:17:32
Realistically though, I don't think bitcoin is going to zero in the short-term. There are still thousands of supporters who would buy some more if we were to see prices lower than $200 or $100.
@_date: 2014-09-09 14:35:25
Don't do it.
@_date: 2014-10-23 20:44:06
you could, but the protocol should be good enough to handle all cases.
@_date: 2014-10-21 22:35:26
It doesn't matter as much, because prices shouldn't be quoted in bitcoin, but in local currency.
@_date: 2014-09-01 23:51:10
Supply and demand. At the moment, there are more sellers than buyers.
@_date: 2014-09-09 03:44:33
interesting, however, don't you still have bitcoin price fluctuation risk?
@_date: 2014-09-26 13:02:24
@_date: 2014-10-13 21:03:36
Bitcoin is not good for micropayments yet. You should probably use some other crypto-currency.
@_date: 2014-10-26 20:23:34
That's exactly what needs to happen. Thanks for bringing this up.
This is what you have to do to pay with bitcoin right now:
- You pay 1% fee at Coinbase to buy bitcoins at the ask price
- You wait for 5 days to receive your coins and the price of bitcoin might have dropped another 10% until then, hence it's effectively a 11% fee
- When you pay at a merchant you get no cash back and no points.
And this is what it happens when you pay with credit card:
- Pay immediately and receive 1-3% cash back or points.
- The money gets taken from your bank account in 1 month.
It's a no-brainer to me that paying by credit card is still the way to go.
@_date: 2014-10-13 17:34:54
his arguments are very weak.
the price doesn't need to be at $10,000 or $100,000 for bitcoin to work. it can work well at current prices as well. Andreessen is right that price will fluctuate.
@_date: 2014-10-07 19:09:33
And it's gone! 
@_date: 2014-09-08 22:21:51

Seems like there are still working on the actual regulations. Sounds like a reasonable discussion overall though.
@_date: 2014-09-26 10:51:16
there are plenty of credit cards that give you cash back and miles, i'm sure you can get one.
@_date: 2014-09-09 03:47:03
I never use Paypal. I just pay with CC directly and there is no fee.
Circle might let you buy for free, but what bid/ask will they use? If you are buying at the ask and paying the merchant at the bid, that's another significant fee right there.
@_date: 2014-10-12 14:01:17
Awesome. How does that work exactly?
Basically it would be great if I logged in with Circle, selected "Send Money to Volabit address" and then it shows me the total cost in $ for the conversion and how many pesos would end up in the other account.
Bitcoin should be completely in the backend ideally and not known to the user.
@_date: 2014-10-16 19:15:28
Gold is not moving either.
@_date: 2014-10-02 15:07:04
That is exactly right and it makes total sense. Even if I had money to buy right now, I wouldn't because I don't know how low the price will drop. I will only start buying once the price has started rising again. So, yes, I won't be able to buy at the absolute bottom, but I will also avoid a lot of losses in the meantime.
@_date: 2014-09-05 23:16:56
How else would you buy and store coins right now?
It's still SO HARD to do.
@_date: 2014-10-27 18:46:52
This is actually good news!
@_date: 2014-09-09 16:47:32
@_date: 2014-10-07 19:04:19
I know, but at the same time they don't advertise as a trading platform. This is only familiar to people who have trading accounts.
@_date: 2014-10-07 19:10:40
And it's gone! 
@_date: 2014-09-08 14:50:13
The only killer app I can see coming is if Coinbase or Circle offered a debit card that would give you more cash back compared to traditional credit cards.
Right now, I have absolutely no incentive to pay with bitcoin. The benefit is only for the merchant, not for the customer.
@_date: 2014-09-01 23:49:03
Most likely good publicity for bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-10-27 04:00:07
Great discussion. I'm reposting my comment from a previous thread:
This is what you have to do to pay with bitcoin right now:
- You pay 1% fee at Coinbase to buy bitcoins at the ask price. Circle doesn't have a fee, but you still buy at the ask price.
- With Coinbase, you wait for 5 days to receive your coins and the price of bitcoin might have dropped another 10% until then, hence it's effectively a 11% fee
- When you pay at a merchant you get no cash back and no points.
And this is what it happens when you pay with credit card:
- Pay immediately and receive 1-3% cash back or points.
- The money gets taken from your bank account in 1 month.
- On top of that you have consumer protection, which is not the case with bitcoin.
It's a no-brainer to me that paying by credit card is still the way to go.
@_date: 2014-09-26 08:39:55
Thanks for the lengthy response! Here are my additional thoughts:




Totally agree with this. The average person doesn't want to be a currency speculator, they only want the cost benefits that come with bitcoin.


I personally don't think bitcoin is a currency, I still think we need traditional currencies and traditional banks. To me, I see bitcoin more as a protocol to efficient transfer value, but that doesn't make it a currency with the traditional sense. Also, the fact that can appreciate or depreciate rapidly doesn't make it a great currency. I prefer to use a currency like the dollar that has the property of slow and steady depreciation. If I knew that the dollar could appreciate a lot, I would want to spend it.


I agree that this has hurt price appreciation in the short term, but once there is some reasonable regulation that passes, more companies will be free to get involved.


I am not sure about that, give that for example Gold has trillions of dollars of market cap and it's still very unstable. The traditional fiat currencies are only stable because they are specifically manipulated by the central banks. However a free market currency like Gold or Bitcoin is not guaranteed to be stable.


The best case scenario would be a good symbiotic relationship between bitcoin and the banks. I don't agree with the strategy of making strong enemies.


I can't wait for this feature. Then I will have no reason to use my credit cards anymore. I will pay with coinbase everywhere and receive lots of cash back!
@_date: 2014-10-02 22:11:50
That should be just enough for the price to drop another $50 :)
@_date: 2014-10-11 01:02:57

This is actually good news.
@_date: 2014-09-26 08:22:00
Yes, but they make it convenient for the user who doesn't know anything about bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-12-19 15:21:57
It's not a good idea IMO to create physical bitcoins. What if you spend the funds in this address and then you try to sell this physical coin to someone else that thinks there is still a bitcoin there?
Did you check that the funds are still there?
@_date: 2014-09-05 23:18:58
They should change their name to Coinbank or JP Base.
@_date: 2014-12-19 21:22:38
OK, but how do they plan to deal with this problem going forward while keeping reddit pseudonymous?
@_date: 2014-09-04 01:58:27

@_date: 2014-09-08 23:39:53
Just to reiterate. From those businesses that "accept bitcoin", they are not really accepting bitcoin. They are just accepting bitpay/coinbase and they get 100% dollars for all transactions.
@_date: 2014-10-16 19:17:22
Bitcoin was a lot more volatile compared to S&amp;P 500 this year. It's great that it appears to be uncorrelated with the stock market though, this can make a useful asset to own to increase diversification in one's portfolio.
@_date: 2014-09-26 08:20:20
My point was that if coinbase implements the feature I am describing above then people won't have to know anything about bitcoin, all they will be dealing with is dollars and a 3% cash back in every transaction. That would be a strong incentive for me to open accounts with bitcoin companies.
@_date: 2014-10-01 21:13:18
To speculate. I bought some and I am waiting to get rich!
@_date: 2014-09-09 14:31:16

@_date: 2014-12-19 21:12:34
This is a great way to pay good contributors globally. This is where bitcoin comes handy, because it would be extremely hard to implement this with credit cards and western union.
If notes equal actual money though, what prevents me from opening 1000s of fake accounts and upvoting my own posts?
@_date: 2014-09-26 08:41:24
Right, but they don't give you cash back and you have to pay 1% fee to buy new bitcoins. So, I'd rather use my credit card instead that give me 1-3% cash back, rather than taking from me 1% in each transaction.
@_date: 2014-10-21 17:10:04
Anything less than 1 dollar. For example, paying for bandwidth by the minute or paying for disk storage by the GB.
It's possible that a node could generate hundreds of payments to be able to use those resources.
@_date: 2014-10-05 13:08:20
Paper wallets with a specific printed amount on them don't make much sense to me. This is because the owner of the paper can spend or deposit funds on that address and the printed number on it won't be updated.
That's a serious flaw IMO.
@_date: 2014-10-07 14:20:15
This is really confusing. Most people will think that their money was stolen.

Does it connect with coinbase or circle?
It would be nice if you could enter the order and at that moment coinbase buys you bitcoin with money in your bank account and then fills the order at purse.io
