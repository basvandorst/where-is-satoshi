I can't tell whether he is implying that you shouldn't consider 0conf bitcoins in your possession or if he doesn't fully understand the relationship between miners and full nodes

Or because society would rather dump debt onto future generations than come up with a balanced budget

Being dismissive won't make that butt-hurt go away. Sorry you got called out for not knowing the basic timeline of US history though that's kind of embarrassing.

Look up the sending address on blockchain.info
If they got sent anywhere you would be able to see what address you sent them to or if you didn't broadcast the transaction at all.

Hey! Your lecture on YouTube "the role of bitcoin as money" is actually what got me interested in learning more about currency and banking.
Since a yard has a concrete length not relative to the height of the building it measures isn't that different from a currency which has a flexible value?

A private key can be almost any 256-bit number
There is a number range that is blocked out. I don't have the why for that part though.
I think the elliptic curve stuff comes into play as you hash the private key down to your address.

It probably helps that we acquired a pretty high quality 1/3 of the North American continent

If we're talking about the United States specifically, that's actually more or less wrong. The Great Depression happened in the 30s and was over by the mid 40s; whereas President Nixon took the United States off of the gold standard in 1971. However, You could argue that the great depression resulted in increased economic intervention by the federal government and that shift in policy eventually led to the removal of the gold standard so that the government could intervene more easily through manipulation of the monetary supply. The current reserve system isn't any more proven by history than systems using fixed or deflationary monetary supplies.

To clarify, I meant that as an arbitrary net value generated by the business (worth 730btc because of it's expected annual revenue minus the value of the paid back loan of 500btc=+230btc)

Someone will always build the tower if it is still profitable. They only stop only building when it costs more than it would make.

What are the sending and receiving addresses respectively?
(Just the address that people turn into QRs, not your private keys or anything like that.)

Clearly his weed dealer REALLY believes in bitcoin

That's an assertion known as an Ad Hominem attack, not an argument. Read a fucking book sometime. 
Also, you're not really in a good position to criticize someone else's education after you made it pretty obvious that you don't even know basic American history...

Someone correct me if I'm wrong but I think coinbase will instantly verify you to buy from them but you have to register your social security number with them for regulatory purposes. 
Coinbase is as legitimate as they come but it is generally ill advised to ever give out that information to anyone you don't absolutely have to.
There are other ways to get verified but you'll have to wait a few days

Ah, so when monetary supply is constant prices become flexible so that the price still represents their relative value versus the total value within the economy?
What happens if all the assets in the bitcoin economy have a total appraised or perceived value above 21,000,000 BTC?
