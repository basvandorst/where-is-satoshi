I would love to do it this way, but I need a way to sell the bitcoins to people to start with as I am pretty sure people around here would be more inclined to buy bitcoin off someone but not online

Thanks for this idea, i think it would be a good way to promote bitcoin and get people familiar with it.

I'm in Australia in a town called wollongong, but since I am on a bike I will hit a bunch of different areas including Sydney CBD

No way, I am on an electric tricycle, much more fun!

I don't want to use any third party companies, even though they provide a great service I want to prove to people as I go that it isn't too complicated to do yourself

thanks for the positive vibe, really appreciate it!

With the blockchain.info merchant app will I also be able to sell bitcoins with it?
thank you for the tip! If only I could repay you with some burrito love!

I would need some crazy arsed batteries to power my trike that far, I have will power but would need some serious Ah on my battery to get that far!

I am specifically doing breakfast burritos, a burrito in the morning makes people happy!

To promote bitcoin do you know of any good A4 printouts that I could print out?
