Explain to me how "All Crypto Currencies combined" is not "We're worth more than you and your customers combined" given crypto is a network of individuals and their wealth combined.
Not one person controls all of bitcoin as an example lol.
You're comparing two completely different things.

It's because it's a sanctioned country in many places. Source: head of fin crimes for some 50 odd banks. 
It's just an automated check in their compliance tool. Looks to be keyword only because the amount is low and the transfer contains low risk.  Probably just a shitty compliance system that isnt using multiple variables.

Uhhh this is wrong. It's just all the assets they own, that's like comparing all investment banks versus bitcoin in comparison. 
The like for like should be - assets under management given it's an investment bank and institutional bank.
In which case JPM is 10x that of all cryptos combined lol.

lmfao lmfao I'm so edgy. Let's all wail on the corrupt F100's!~111`
The guy is a multi billion dollar CEO of one of the largest banks on the planet and you don't think he can figure out how to use Bitcoin? Jesus christ. 
Reading all your posts is like watching a 14 year old bash his keys against his face while the veins protrude out of your head.

I'm curious, does anyone have an educated impact to the market the creditors selling off the coins are having?

Do you understand what gamblers fallacy is? T9elling someone to hold because it's worked out before does not mean it will in the future, if the money to the individual may have an extreme negative implication going to $0 Because that's a realistic option here they need to consider their own investments on their own merit. 
Mindlessly saying hodl is fucking stupid.
