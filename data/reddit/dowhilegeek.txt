Let's be clear about something. I'm not here to take the adoption rate of bitcoin to the moon, that isn't my job. The amazing technology being built by very talented developers and the idealistic community rallying behind it is doing that well enough on their own. I'm here to cater to the the best interests of the people that help me grow my business in invaluable ways.
You don't use ltc? Thats fine. I'm catering to you by offering bitcoin. But I have zero interest in listening to your complaints about being equally accommodating to other people, as much as I am to you. The world isn't built for you, or a certain special interest group, its made for everyone.

For me, it isnt about not having a smartphone, its about ease of use. I have a wallet on my phone, and another on  my pc. I want to just flash my webcam a qr from somones phone screen to send them some coin.
Ease of use should not be something exclusive to the mobile platform.

I decided to start working on adding bitcoin because theres maybe 6 folks at my church including me that use it a bit, so why not eh? If nothing else, church members that know nothing about btc will start to wonder what that button is for, and look into it.

I started mining ltc when it was $0.08, and its been pretty good to me so far. I figure I can't be the only one that uses both cryptos.

Do unto others as you would have done unto yourself, friend. Given that context, I wouldn't reckon you, or anyone for that matter, to be a glutton for stereotypical slander and ridicule.

Ive bought thousands of usd worth of bitcoin through Coinbase since you guys have offered it, and I've believed in you guys amidst all the hate on this sub, but this is too much. You lost me.

I'm always astonished how few people know about or use google sheets. In its entire existence I've never had a "oh shoot I cant do this in sheets"moment.

They have an arbitration service now, this changes everything.

Do you take ltc donations?

I would buy one.

If they competed price wise with the other asics out there I'd buy dozens.

I use blender also, and I wanna critique this just a little. As I'm sure you know, part of realistic rendering is making sure things arnt perfect, in this case metal materials. They have perfect sheen, you should make it a little rougher, maybe add some scratch textures.
That aside the model and scene look groovy!

Has anyone refused your money when they see these?
