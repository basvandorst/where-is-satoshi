Bitcoin is decentralized. There doesn't have to be a specific group to work on it. Anyone can propose improvements for the network and its up to the people who use bitcoin to accept it or not

A lot of us, who were holding on coinbase before August 1, were waiting for coinbase to release Bitcoin cash so we can dump it once its available for us , and now people are crying? Coinbase isn't really helping bcash. Its massive growth atm is most likely temporary . Just sell your bcash if you had it on coinbase (if you don't believe in it) and stop bitching. The majority will choose the better option. If you truly believe bitcoin is the better option, there is no need to be whining.
