@_date: 2017-12-14 22:03:41

@_date: 2017-12-13 22:28:28
Yeah it looked computer generated. Is this what futures looks like?
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:51:48
 haha I’m embarrassed already. But it came out alright.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:23:17
What does that mean exactly? Like why is that bad? Does it mean the transactions are not as secure?
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:58:21
What Happened to it?
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:36:50
Naw didn’t think that name would be too common but it could be lol.

What about ripple? It is like a different take. Centralized, regulated, banks are backing it. What do people think about it? It’s about to go to Cohn base so I’m a little like uhhh shit

So it’s the sell point and buy point. Just happens to line up. Sells to a certain point then triggers people buy point?
Sorry I never know if im sounding like a complete idiot
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:47:26
Yeah it seems like that would be a good plan. If you have a lot of money you push people around. Like in poker. Cuz no one knows what will happen just create an illusion to get what you need by pushing the money around.

Yes the PR on bitcoin needs to focus less on what it is and more on what it can do. Regardless. If people are throwing money in..it doesn’t matter if they know what they are doing. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:40:48
Oh yeah typo
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:10:13
FUD? Do you see what I’m saying though. It’s not like a normal wave form it drops steep and come back very steep. Short time intervals. I see like 3 lines in the last hour.

That username. I played in a band and made a track called galactic cannibalism.  
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:33:53
I don’t get these fees for some reason. I think I get like 2 Dollars. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:03:57
Hey some problems with bitcoin are started to get exposed like transaction fees and all that. Is Coinbase able to evolve to combat problems that come up? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:02:23
Andreas antapolous. 
Or badcrypto podcast with Ronnie moas. Those got me on he hype train. 
Also I use this example. People say it has not value overlook limitations of the banks.
When I moved to college I had to get a different bank from my parents. They had to jump through hoops getting money to me. If I ran out of money on Friday I was screwed till Monday. With this system it is instant (more a litecoin application). 
Say you want to invest in something over seas. That would be even harder and expensive. This eliminates that problem. 
If he says it’s not physical how can you measure it. My mom had a hard time getting that it was internet money. Just tell him you can’t measure or grasp the Internet, but if you order something it’s going to show up at your house.
