Strongest horse does not always win, first mover is also important.
But if another coin is going to overtake bitcoin, it has to be a very very strong horse, with new technology that doesnt fit with the bitcoin model.(if it fits, and is good, bitcoin will just utilize it :))
@_date: 2018-11-30 21:15:55
Maybe :) ethereum seems pretty strong.
I like dapps, but can dapps run on raiden?
Or is there another scaling solution for dapps?
(it could get a bit expensive needing block-space for every statefull call to a contract)

so your saying there is a 1/175,000,000 chance bitcoin will ever go to $100k :p ?   Id say the odds are quite a bit better than that :)

How would a non bitcoin holder predict that?     
If you predict bitcoin will go to the moon, you would have already invested..      
Unless you hate wealth

For buying a coffee or groceries and things like that locally, its not much difference from visa, other than less fee (using lightning network).     
Lightning network is pretty new, so I think we will see more adoption once its more mature.     
For sending  value across national borders though, bitcoin solves a lot of issues because it does not care about borders, unlike the old banking system. Its just a normal transaction across the network.      
Also there is no authority to stop you from sending a transaction, so if you wanted to send value to a terrorist in afghanistan (which is a complex country to send money to with banking system), noone could stop you.   
     
Also if you create a website and want to receive money, you would with the old system have to make a deal with a payment processor(which takes a significant cut), so people could pay you.    
With bitcoin you wouldnt have to ask anyone, just set it up and start receiving.    
There are tons of more pro's of bitcoin, but those are some

wtf do you mean ?the protocol rejects you when you try to double spend(the nodes running in the network enforces the protocol rules, and everyone has to agree for your transaction to be included in the next block) , its not that hard.And the same with other rules.You cant break the rules, easy as that.Rules sometimes change, when everyone agrees, like we changed the rules to accept segregated witness in august 2018.

financial independence, although you dont need to be very rich for that.

bitcoin runs on consensus, and has since its inception.    
I think you should read this [
@_date: 2019-01-10 17:54:35
Sorry, i thought we were talking about bitcoin.       
Which you cant really regulate, you cant stop a criminal from creating a new anonymous address and receiving money.     
But we are talking about an alternate government running on blockchain?     
I know there are some projects focusing on that, but I havent really followed it.     
In the far future we could have a consensus mechanism where citizens votes for an AI that is connected to a network of robots that can enforce the law :)

What is wrong at this point?     
The technology is stronger than it has ever been, now with lightning network in the pipeline, still censorship resistant, democratized protocoll rules, better privacy, close to instant transactions, close to zero fees, predictable monetary inflation.     
I can't really imagine a future where this technology is just abandoned.     
Although it could be another coin that takes the lead, but it doesn't look like that currently, and it would take time to gain that reputation, and a lot of time to gain a mature software ecosystem around it, which these coin/protocoll systems needs, so developers have good tools to create something in the space.

Its not tied up, you can take them out of a lightning channel whenever youd like. Its like your spending account, and you wouldnt really have to take them out of the lightning channel, because all nodes are connected through a mesh network, you can send to whoever youd like in the lightning network, so there would be little reason to take them out of the channel.

I'd go with dynamodb :)  
Seems like a good solution for a centralized currency, with automatic horizontal scaling..
@_date: 2018-12-21 20:18:43
yes it does.      
biba8163 explained it better than i can:
  
Lightening uses source routing where originator defines the optimal path of hops to take and encrypts each hop in the path and embeds in layers. 1st node can only read outer layer, each node can only read where the next destination is and only the final node that knows the final destination. Conversely, the final node won't be able to map back and who the originator was. Each layer is encrypted with the node's public key and only that node would be able to get the information that is intended for them.

thanks :D
@_date: 2018-12-22 11:19:17
you mean centralized hugeblock coins, which after a while of heavy usage wont even sync on most computers.  
Or centralized master-node coins?      
I'd say lightning network and second layer solutions is a better approach.
@_date: 2018-12-17 21:34:51
so you bought it before you understood it?  
Seems pretty stupid.  
Anyways, have you not tried lightning network?  
And even if you were right about its inneffectiveness as a currency,  
(which ur not because of second layer solutions, and eventual blocksize increases and techniques to reduce transaction sizes)  
It is still a decentralized store of value with hardcoded inflation where noone other than your private key can do uncensorable programmable transactions.
@_date: 2018-12-05 19:55:04
but lightning is a better solution for small payments anyways, with pretty much instant confirmation.While onchain transactions you have to either accept 0-confirmation transaction, oor wait until its included in block.Fine for big transfers, but not fine when paying for groceries or whatever.     
Edit: 0-confirmation transactions, might be safe.. Im not sure
@_date: 2018-12-17 17:30:11
if internet was pretty new, and you had not seen many usecases for it.     
If you didnt understand it, you couldnt really have an opinion on the future of the internet, if it would last, or just a stupid invention.     
Kindof like bitcoin today, if you dont understand it, it can maybe seem like a less intuitive paypal with its own currency.      
@_date: 2018-12-17 21:59:13
there is no congestion on lightning network, only involved nodes need to know about the transaction, aka a lot better scaling.   
And as transactions moves to lightning network and transactions sizes gets reduced onchain and blocksize increase there will be a lot more room onchain to open channels, which you would anyways only do a few times a month max to top up your "spending account".   
edit: Eventually you could receive your salary to your lightning node, and you wouldnt have to "top up" your "spending account", you could invest in stocks or funds directly from your lightning node.

have more balls when hodling.     
it seems scary holding something you dont really know what is.      
same with stocks, its scary holding a stock you dont know much about.
@_date: 2018-12-17 21:20:09
Sure, same as selling at the peak and buying again at the bottom in july 2011, april 2013, december 2013, etc were good ideas.   But unless you knew the perks of bitcoin compared to fiat etc, why did you buy it in the first place?
@_date: 2018-12-17 17:39:22
if you really understand it, you can make a lot of money building solution on top of bitcoin.      
but other than that, have a stronger hand when it comes to trading, because you understand the implications of the technology.
