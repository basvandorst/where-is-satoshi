What happens if I lose my phone or it gets stolen?
Is there a need for a central server somewhere either during registration or for each login? What happens if it goes down?
Also: Is it open source?

So I still need to type a password on my phone to decrypt the private key?

Can't the Chinese just fork and to hell with the rest of the world?

I remember an experiment where some people were gifted some money and then asked to fill a survey while others where told they'd get the money if they filled the survey. The first group was more willing to do the survey because of the gift.
Being given these gifts pressure you into donating yourself. Not that it's a bad thing.

Oh right. Each person received a unique address.  it seems to be a leak of emails from several services.

Whoever runs coinurl probably has other bitcoin related services. Probably all running on the same server/database.
**Edit:** seems to be affecting people from several different services, so it doesn't seem to be a single server breach.

Seems like nobody was naive enough.
I wonder how they got the email database...

It's called [email spoofing]( Basically, they add a Reply-to: header in the email and that's what appears in the email client. It is the job of the receiving end to verify if it's legit or reject it. Apparently coinbase's account on their mail service (sendgrid.com) got compromised.
