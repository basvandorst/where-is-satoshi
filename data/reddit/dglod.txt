No problem. For the BCH, BTC and CLAM you should be able to swipe the private key with a wallet app, for example [coinimi]( and then send them to the exchange you want to sell them at. From what I can read in the coinimi docs, swiping the private key actually sends the coins from your old address to your coinimi wallet before you can see them.
As mentioned before, empty out the BTC from the address before you attempt this :)

Software developer here, while it is nice to have a good integration test suite, not having any failing tests doesn't mean that your software does not have bugs, it means that you don't have enough tests ;)

I saw a youtube vid about a miner in Florida who kept his miners outside-ish in wooden boxes. Don't know if Florida is considered tropical climate, but seemed like it worked out ok wrt. temperatures.
Wood might not be the best idea, building up the boxes in some sort of metal would probably be a lot safer.

Haha, gotta get that wife acceptance factor as high as possible! Disguise it as a beehive, tell her the noise is from the bees, as a bonus this probably also keeps the thieves away :D

No, I live in northern Europe. The building luckily didn't burn down, the majority of the fire damage was to the roof, the rest was caused by water, smoke and soot.

Yeah, pure coincidence. Made me think twice about mining from home as well, my [3xGPU rig]( has been mining away for a long time, even when I haven't been home. The cards and stuff are probably all dead from water damage now anyway, but I don't think I'll setup a new rig in my home. Talked to one of the cleanup crew guys who told me that fires caused by electrical equipment are quite common.

Shit, sorry to hear that! How long was this ago? Hope your situation has recovered since then!
In my situation it looks like the insurance companies (my own and the construction company one) are fighting it out to figure out who has to pay the damages.
