Nope. You have to wait until the news starts reporting that the bubble burst then the next dip. When everything is all said and done I am betting it is going to be around 3000-3200. But hey this is currency not a stock

I think there is 2 more rounds of this 
1) when the mainstream news starts reporting about it
2) Sep 30 
around 2500 when all is said and done

Basically the only advice you will get here is buy bitcoins or hodl.
Here is my opinion: 
Unless your power is real cheap don't buy S7 get an S9.
You can use   to get an idea. 
You will make some money. But not enough to justify the noise and heat.  
If an S9 is too expensive then you can do cloud  mining. ( Start the ponzi scheme rants ) . I have 2 cloud accounts 1 with pool.bitcoin.com ( expensive ) another with genesis-mining. There are a lot of people ranting about genesis-mining about ponzi schemes more than others and they did have payout issues when I started but I didn't have to ask for them they worked through them and now they are paying regularly. I am not a fan of cloud mining but that is how I started with bitcoin. Just don't go in for more than you  can
