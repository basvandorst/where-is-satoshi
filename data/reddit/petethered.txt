That's the problem, statistical level of confidence doesn't really exist for non deterministic systems.
I almost used self driving cars as my example instead of social signals because while it looks non deterministic , driving is very much a deterministic system at small time scales  and even weakly so at longer ones and why genetic algorithms are used for programming them.
In the large timescale and with a big enough data set, a driving system can predict the odds of the car in front of you is going to take the next exit.  Simple statistics will give you the base odds ( 1:10 cars on this road take this exit at this time of day ) and even better ones with lots of data ( minivans are more likely to take the exit that leads to the elementary school then a 2 seater sports car is ), and then once the timescale starts to get smaller and the signals more fine grained, the better it will get.   For example, if someone turns on their blinker and starts hitting the brakes , the odds start raising considerably that the person is going to take the exit and the bot can start to move down those decision trees.
At a very short time frame ( subsecond ) confidence levels are through the roof.
If brakes are on, car is decelerating, rate of deceleration is increasing, in the next 1/100th of a second you can predict with near perfect accuracy where that car is going to be.
The problem with trying to apply this stuff to market trading is that you don't have nearly enough data points to make predictions with confidence that will hold up since the systems act in non-deterministic ways.  
Just because bitcoin went up for an hour yesterday, doesn't mean it's going to go up for an hour today given the same inputs.  Take the recent hack... a year ago, the price would have dropped in BTC with that news... now it barely blipped the price.  So had you trained a bot with that data set, it would have reacted to that signal but would have been wrong.
Now, you can play in the shorter timescale with market curves... SMA, EMA, Bollinger Bands, RSI , etc (  ) but then you will get crushed by the commissions as I said originally... the 0.25% maker/taker costs means that you can't make money on sub percent moves really.  So now you are trying to predict at longer timescales and there's just so much unknown data that the system will behave in a non deterministic way.

And just since I'm bored I'll expand a little on this...
Genetic algorithms work best with deterministic systems, where in past signals are predictive of future outcomes.
Let's use social signals as a an example since there's a lot of research into AI and genetic algorithms are being applied here.   
Let's say the data set shows Sally is posting constantly with cats, specifically female cats, and posting with keywords such as loud, butt, sometimes... With this data points, the system can reasonably predict the odds of Sally's cat being unfixed and that she's posting about it being in heat, and then act on that by showing her ads for vets with specials on spaying.
That's determanistic... given a set of previous inputs the likely output can be calculated and given odds of happening again and as such the genetic algorithms are good at working with them.
Now, the stock market ( and the BTC market ) are non determanistic.  This means that what happened one second ago is not strongly predictive of what will happen at the next second outside of some broad generalities.
Read about the random walk hypothesis (  ) for a starting point if you want to do research on the topic.
With a metric fuck ton of signals and analysis you might be able to come up with SOMETHING, but considering there are trillions of dollars on the line in the stock market and the BTC market is basically just a smaller version of that, some very smart people have been working on this problem and given that they don't own the world yet, have likely not solved the problem.

Hey man,
THought I'd clarify something... go forth and build a bot.  It's fun and it covers a wide spectrum of skills.  And doing it with coins is actually a whole lot nicer then stocks as you can buy/sell fracitonals... so when/if you play with money you don't need a lot ( even $50 in the account ) to actually do something and give you that thrill that you don't get from looking at virtual dollars moving around.
Go about it something like this:
Pick your exchange... bittrex or poloniex both have reasonable apis to program with
Build your ingress programs... you need a dataset to work with, the bigger the better.  
Pick a time scale.. 1s is probably too fast ( and just storing ticker data without some skills in databases already will start to bog down once you get a days data... 86400s*200coins = 17.3mm rows a day.  So 6s per tick? 1minute per tick? That's up to you.
You could do flat file storage ( basically a log file ) and use it as a ticker tape for streaming into your bot to see how it will do. For realtime calculations it would be simple "tail 20 lines of file to calculate sma20" "tail 40 lines to calculate ema20" assuming you stick each trading pair in it's own file.
Then start developing your signals library... learn how to calculate all the various indications ( SMA, EMA, RSI , Bollinger Bands, etc ).
Figure out every variable you can think of that you can assign a value to ( minimum hold, maximum hold, slopes, convergence, indicatior variation, minimum cross time, minimum gain, minimum loss before trigger,  etc ).
Pay attention to last/ask/bid prices when you are doing your calculations... if you just use last price , when you try to apply it to reality the spreads are going to hurt you.  If you don't want to track a whole lot of depth, just use the ask price for buying and the bid price for selling, but when you get into larger amounts of coin you'll be moving along those bands since there won't be enough depth for you to execute at exactly that price.
Make sure you calculate maker/taker fees in ... 0.25% is the standard commission for trades. So when the bot buys, subtract 0.25% of what it bought ( balance = money / ask price * 0.9975 ) to figure out it's initial holdings ( so you are down 0.25% from the moment you buy ) and then do it again when it sells from what you would get back.  So you are basically down ~0.6% in every transaction.
Then start playing... GA's aren't great as has been said in this thread since they tend to optimize themselves for the sample data and don't do well with the random data. But do it, it's a good learning experience... then play with OTHER machine learning algorithms.
Go wild!
ANother option that's good too is try to program "you".  Assuming you play the markets already, try to come up with a algorithm that matches YOUR decision making process and have the bot be a virtual "you".  ie. "Oh man, eth has been going up all day, btc is going down, there's a big spread in the bid/ask price, there's a small wall that's going down... ETH has been all over the news today... I'm going to buy some".  Figure out what made you say that and program your bot to mimic that as your starting point.

Here you go man... 
is totally correct... genetic algorithm is not the way to go with this kind of bot.
Markets are non-deterministic, so a genetic algorithm is going to curve fit to your historical data.
At the absolute best, you can go with a route that is rebuilding itself constantly like I did, but it's not going to ever fit terribly well.  
Mine did ok for a bit but this was back in the days where NOTHING existed.  You couldn't even place limit orders on the markets so it was very naive.  Now the markets are much more mature .
The REAL problem you will run into is timescale and commissions.  Even a relatively simple bot using something like just SMA50 over SMA100 can make drips and drabs , but the market commissions of 0.25 on both make and take will kill you.... you need to clear over 0.6% increase on each trade before you even make a dime.

To paraphrase myself, there are "a metric fuck ton of signals".
You could use Monte Carlo in 2 ways if you were programming a bot... As a predictive tool and as a test tool.
Predictive would basically be generating a large sample of walks and then curve fitting and see if there's a general trend... since MC tends to fall into a bell curve thanks to it's uses of standard deviation, you could see if the general curve is up.
The second use would be in simulation... so you've built a bot that runs ok on historical data and you want to see how it would handle unknown data.... you use the MC to generate multiple new futures and test against that.  
One of the tricks when trying to develop a bot is to separate your sample data... you split it into dev/test set and an evaluation set.  Look into the Netflix ratings challenge from a while back... basically they  gave researchers a sample set of data for days 1-10 to develop their ratings prediction bot, and then would run it against a secret data set of days 11-20 and rate the results. ( I made up the date ranges, don't remember the real ones )
Basically, you split the data set to give yourself a way of checking if your bot is just fitting itself best to the historical vs finding a more generic program that performs better overall.
MC gives you a way of testing your bot against many future scenarios that are not just truely random data, but data that fits possible futures given past movements.

I don't actually recommend providing international SMS for your service. 
Your margin is already pretty razor thin based on your fees, and international SMS can be amazingly expensive.

Depends on if you offer dispute resolution.
If you take escrow.com for example, if there is a dispute, the parties get 14 days to figure it out.
If that doesn't work, they get 14 days to go through an approved arbitration service.
After that , escrow.com will refund the buyer, less fees.
That's a seller fuck-you scenario... what you also need to think of is a buyer fuck you... 
"Seller sent me a brick in a box" ( when the object was actually there ).
For SELLER protection, Clearcoin offered a Charity-escrow... if there was a dispute, the funds were donated to charity instead of returning to buyer, so no reason for buyer to dispute. ( Well, less reason ... could just be a dick )
You could also offer a passthrough service... aka seller ships to you, you verify, ship to buyer...

Take a look at [SpendBitcoins.com](
They link to a couple of the "reputation sites" as a way to indicate the safety of spending coins with them.
And as to buying stuff with coins, an trusted escrow service would be nice since clearcoin closed its doors.  But to be trusted, you would need to build a quality reputation, form a company, etc, etc.
Also, even google provides a seller reputation in their shopping search... so a reputation based mall wouldn't be a bad idea.
You allow anyone to list their store, charge for premium placement, and put ads on the site.

Essentially, you get the exact same reward mining at MtRed as you do deepbit. 
The difference is in the &lt;edit&gt;btc / time&lt;/edit&gt;.  With deepbit, you are a much smaller part of the pool ( say 0.03% with 1gh/s ) but the number of solved blocks is higher.
The math ( ignoring donations, and assuming you are in the block the entire round) is pretty simple:
50btc * your hashrate / pool hashrate  = payout per block
So with MtRed
50btc/block * 1gh/s / 214 gh/s = 0.23btc / block
With Deepbit
50btc/block * 1 / 3998gh = 0.0125 btc / block 
Now, to see that it's approximately the same:
3998gh/214gh * 0.0125 = .233 btc

I suspect part of the problem with WU is lack of automatic notifications.
A human being needs to verify / collect all transactions when it comes to WU.
Add in the additional paperwork issue... the end user has to provide a MTCN number to the receiver and then deposits have to be linked to those payments.
Basically... it's fucking annoying ;)

Let's think about bots on the market.
Currently, there are 2 types of possible bots on the market, commission free and with commission.
Now, a commission free bot is bound only by the rules the designate it's behavior.  I'll give you a grossly oversimplified version of a bot:
* If MACD &lt; 0 , sell increment 
* if MACD &gt; 0 , buy increment
* if PRICE &lt; floor - hard stop
A couple of commission free bots could keep the market steadyish assuming different trigger levels, because the goal is to make ANY profit, because there is no commission to be concerned with covering.
Now, the second type of bot, commission bound, is slightly more interesting
Because  there is a commission involved, the movement has to encompass a .6% change to break even.
So , bot buys 1.003 btc at current spot price of $13.9291, receives 1 btc in account and paid an effective price of $13.9709 for that one btc...  and to turn a profit, has to sell it at &gt; $14.0128.
So the algorithm has to be something more like this
* if MACD &gt; 0 AND price &gt; effectivebuy X commission  X minimum profit ( say 1% ), sell
* if MACD &lt; 0 and price &lt; maximum buy price, buy
* if price &lt; floor hard stop
Now... to get a feeling about bots on the market, just look at the latest trades... the trades are larger for the most part... in excess of 1 btc when sum similar timestamp trades.... and since the movements in price don't exceed &gt; 1% most of the time, it's just humans buying and selling...
If you saw alot of smaller transactions , then there could be commission bound bots playing around and holding price steady... ( if transaction size was 0.01btc  then penny moves in price would = profit )

It's a little more complex then this ( when you send btc you actually send all of the ones associated with an address in 2 transactions, one with the BTC going to recipient and one with your "change" coming back ), but this covers the basics.

Essentially what mining is now is taking a stack of waiting transactions, adding in a transaction for 25 btc ( the what you get for mining transaction )  , and computing the hashes of these transactions until the target hash is found.
Each one of the transactions ( theoretically ) has 2 actual transactions, one the BTC being sent, and a second smaller transaction containing the "fee" that the miner gets.
So when the the "new" bitcoins run out, the only thing left for the miner is the transaction fees.  
The theory is that by the time this happens, the volume of transactions will be sufficient to make it worth the miners effort simply to get the transaction fees.
