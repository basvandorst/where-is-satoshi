No.  You can read the whole thread from the beginning here: 
Mike said "The purpose of tx replacement is to implement high frequency trading, according to material Satoshi sent me when I asked him".  He later quoted Satoshi as saying "One use of nLockTime is high frequency trades between a set of parties.
They can keep updating a tx by unanimous agreement."

FYI, someone found it; or at least, they found a black circular sticker on the railing near a ladder near the end of the wharf, but so far they weren't successful in getting their phone to read it, so they took the sticker home.  (not me, but I saw them)
