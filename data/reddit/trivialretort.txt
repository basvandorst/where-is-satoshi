Is that actually working out for you?

Make sure you use Google trusted stores when buying from them. It will still be a hassle...but at least you will have Google doing the dirty work for you.

Phantom 530? If so, the same exact thing happened to me. 
Except the only customer support Tiger gave me was using their chat client which would often "disconnect" before an resolution was made. I tried calling them, but was put on hold for a 1hr 45mins without ever talking to a person, before I heard a "click" and was disconnected. I emailed them and never received a response (I checked spam/junk too). Luckily, when I ordered, I used Google trusted stores, and they were able to get Tiger to refund me.

They were recently bought by a shady company apparently. Use ublock

Apparently, I was wrong. It was Adblock, not ABP that was sold.
However, more recent stories are reporting the adblock was actually bought by adblock plus. So, you might actually be safe.
A lot of people seem to be turned off by the "acceptable ads program" that they've implemented now. I'll let you decide that.
Regardless, uBlock Origins is fantastic!

Goddamn...that dude just keeps changing what Peterson says and calling him a coward for not saying it that way. I'm trying to get through it, but it's fucking difficult.
EDIT: I'll also admit that Peterson doesn't necessarily always have a solution. Few do. However, a key reason he rose to prominence is due to the fact that people are not even allowed to discuss the problem (or at least he saw that it was heading in that direction). People need to be able to have a conversation about difficult topics in order to come up with reasonable solutions.

I'm curious... did you develop your present opinion of Jordan Peterson off of videos he put out, or from people discusssing his videos?
I'm honestly curious.

I would imagine he'd want it to go up *after* he bought some.

Pretty sure the root solution prevents innocent people from having their bitcoins stolen.

Give them to me.
(I regret not buying in...and I am honestly still pretty clueless)
Edit: I was joking
