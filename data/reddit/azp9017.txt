well, there's the lot of sarcasm hidden in this picture.For those who didn't understood it's basically about the heat produced by  mining , which is ultimately having a great impact on environment. Some estimates say more than 60 percent of the processing power used to mine bitcoin is in China, where it relies heavily on burning of coal. As we know,coal and other fossil fuels are the largest generator of electricity for the rest of the world and also a significant benefactor towards man-made climate changes .Burning of it thereby produces carbon dioxide leading to global warming . So if i sum up everything together , traditional mining has great impacts which can be a peril to our environment. when we look around, we might find solutions  like MIB Coin which is an app for mining ,ico like this are taking a great initiative towards betterment of crypto world by using a system l which does not require any gpu or asic , eventually solving excessive power problem . Hoping to find some more ICOs like this so that there can be some upgradation in mining space as well.
