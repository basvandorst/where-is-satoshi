I remember putting half a bitcoin in my tip account....

oh hello meritocracy....
@_date: 2014-04-11 13:30:17
as a guy who bought at $10. I'm not sweating.
@_date: 2014-05-09 00:13:59
What about UK universities..... ac.uk. 
@_date: 2014-03-12 22:07:20
I like how, because gold is seven hundred years old and more stable, bitcoin will fail because right now, it cannot compete with gold.
@_date: 2014-06-25 00:12:11
Somehow I don't think my Universities hospitality department would allow you to set up shop in reception....
@_date: 2014-06-26 14:44:17
Don't forget scan.co.uk a big computer retailer in the UK. 
@_date: 2014-04-11 13:24:24
doesn't that basically lead to centralisation?
@_date: 2014-03-05 08:40:50
and you didn't mention Asimov, for shame sir.
@_date: 2014-07-11 13:56:44
Brace for downvotes. 
@_date: 2014-07-11 11:17:39
I got one, waited 11months, made me 10 bitcoins, satisfied customer here.
@_date: 2014-09-01 14:39:48
I bought at £4 :) 
@_date: 2017-01-10 14:45:05
What an efficient use of entropy. 
@_date: 2016-11-29 07:19:40
So having been out of bitcoin for a while, why is the obvious choice not to increase the physical blocksize to allow for more transactions, but keep everything in the ledger. 
@_date: 2016-11-29 12:13:27
So importantly, bitcoin has not forked yet? My investment is safe. I mean call me a luddite but with arbitrary data storage wasn't a key tenet of bitcoin the idea that anyone could view all the transactions. 
So are people suggesting that specific entities log their own transactions and validate through some check process against the master block chain? 
@_date: 2012-05-30 13:05:47
I'm UK still waiting...
@_date: 2012-07-05 14:30:51
i have the print issue I am a Uk customer you may have spoken to on twitter ;)
@_date: 2012-04-01 22:44:41
I use grooveshark, would pay in bitcoins
@_date: 2012-05-30 13:07:12
yeah, some of us don't like the idea of paying for something and not actually getting to keep it....
@_date: 2012-08-19 14:58:42
every time you buy and sell speculatively to make $ or £ profits, you are hurting the Bitcoin economy. seriously, this shit is why we can't have nice things.
@_date: 2012-07-05 08:24:50
it is very nice to see a bit of impartiality in an article about something as controversial as the Silk Road. This article needs to go absolutely everywhere. i for one, am sharing this with everyone I know.
@_date: 2012-08-19 18:01:46
but it is artificial, not real liquidity.
@_date: 2012-07-01 14:32:47
i'm often in the minority in my relationship wanting it to go down.
@_date: 2012-03-14 11:16:54
It made me about £3.00 :D
@_date: 2012-07-04 14:54:44
i'd send seti a bitcoin or two.... link to the facebook post?
@_date: 2012-02-28 18:10:43
What is the quote?  Positive. 
@_date: 2012-05-30 21:54:23
how many UK orders are there?
@_date: 2012-07-01 18:09:11
me, my GF and her prerogative.
@_date: 2012-06-28 11:23:55
 is who i use you can go from cash to coins in a few hours. 
@_date: 2012-03-22 23:00:25
I just bought a 3 month subscription. next month i plan to buy another few copies of issue 1
@_date: 2012-02-10 10:46:29
these are massively cool
@_date: 2012-07-19 21:36:05
that makes more sense.
@_date: 2012-06-27 13:21:10
I use intersango and have found them to be incredibly effective. I recommend everyone i tell about bitcoin in the UK to use them.
@_date: 2012-03-14 11:21:02
Well what do brokers and hedge fund managers do?
@_date: 2012-07-19 16:31:10
bitcoinia consultancy and bitcoin consultancy are one and the same? I thought intersango was run by three londoners...
@_date: 2012-06-25 16:11:00
intersango have been very prompt and helpful with transfers and the fees are small,
@_date: 2016-05-03 21:33:45
their online presence is garbage tier journalism normally. it's never completely without basis, there is just a lot of sensationalism.
@_date: 2015-03-30 20:11:12
It's not like the assets will be returned to their "rightful" owners though. 
@_date: 2016-05-03 21:52:26
I'm not criticising their print editions, which I have always enjoyed. Just some of the stuff they share online, is either recycled, or just clickbait.
@_date: 2016-05-03 21:43:41
well, and I will use time magazine as another example, they are pandering to the facebook audience.

got order confimation on 26th of June.
EDIT: got my dates wrong, payed via international transfer 2nd of july.
@_date: 2013-07-12 10:09:34
exactly, people use it for things, the government are people.
@_date: 2013-07-07 13:12:45
@_date: 2013-07-12 11:07:14
please don't make this political, the point stands, a group of individual have a defined common use for the currency, and in that and only that it has value.
@_date: 2013-07-02 12:16:23
yeah it will be like the 2012 spike all over again, dropping to my bet 30-40 then people will start going ooh, that's not so bad. Plus new people are confused by such an expensive exchange rate I think.
EDIT: in fact, I might start quoting the exchange rate in mBTC.
@_date: 2013-09-11 18:13:13
how does one acquire one?
@_date: 2013-09-01 18:19:16
I use bit bargain for selling my mining proceeds, my average transaction time offer to coin release is 8 minutes. 11 trades so far. Secure and fast, a premium price for a premium service 
@_date: 2013-07-13 09:15:10
but it doesn't encourage adoption does it, it's exploiting a niche of convenience and ignorance. businesses like that will never help stabilise the price.
@_date: 2017-06-15 07:27:48
You serious? I didn't know. 
@_date: 2013-07-10 15:45:05
@_date: 2013-07-12 10:08:40
well that aspect of everyone having the full ledger explains why they cant be copied...
@_date: 2013-08-07 22:23:01
remember this is a whole new industry that is growing here, ASIC miners and all, with such new tech there will always be delays and hiccups.
@_date: 2013-08-15 14:17:13
granted, but as it stands today, the ailment of drug addiction is not victimless.
@_date: 2013-12-02 02:07:19
i ordered a butterfly labs 5ghz in june 12 arrived 1 year later, now £5000 in the green.
@_date: 2013-08-15 20:14:43
I think decriminalisation of cannabis and even perhaps ecstasy would be beneficial however, the addictive nature of cocaine and heroin cannot be ignored. 
@_date: 2013-06-04 19:47:35
Jalapeno to the UK
@_date: 2013-08-15 11:15:26
addicts are victims, families of drug addicts are victims, victims of drug motivated crime are victims. To say drug use has no victims, is just wrong. 
Not to say that is the fault of the drug. People can be right cunts.
@_date: 2013-09-14 17:53:31
well I payed $140 for the miner, it is running at university so free electric, had 7.5 btc out of it since it arrived. cashed out 6 at 140. still got 1.5
@_date: 2013-08-15 18:32:28
Considering we have no viable way to distinguish between those who are at risk of addiction and those who are not, surely airing on the side of caution is responsible. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 00:15:50
that or dark confindant
@_date: 2013-07-15 20:33:24
also correction, a Mhash is one million hashes a Thash is **one Trillion hashes**
@_date: 2013-07-11 22:37:49
yeah that moment when they finally understand that the Pound only has value because people use it for stuff, and that is it.
@_date: 2013-09-14 17:32:58
my 5gh's miner has still made me $800 in profit so far.
@_date: 2013-06-05 11:02:38
I think I paid about $40 for international shipping.

Heads, tails, heads, or is that my discrete mathematics leaking again. 
@_date: 2013-07-06 20:50:57
$60 a week isn't that bad. considering I paid $150.
@_date: 2013-11-29 18:26:56
no, bro, you are a hero. :)
@_date: 2013-07-15 21:31:10
now just need to add bitcoin to the currency dropdown.
@_date: 2013-08-15 11:15:30

I think the swell around the last bubble is just dying down.
@_date: 2013-09-14 17:58:35
electricity won't have cost more than $50 since it arrived.
@_date: 2013-03-22 02:09:55
that would put a 2014 price around 10-15 dollars.
@_date: 2013-07-11 14:40:16
using BB also allows you to only trade with bank account verified traders. cash depositing like that opens you up to a very high risk of money laundering. you can end up with your accounts frozen and having to answer some serious questions. in fact cash deposits are not allowed.
@_date: 2013-04-13 22:47:24
have you seen the production quality from the digital playground guys? I am seriously considering buying.
@_date: 2013-04-04 16:43:12
what about the russian drip feed supply and undeclared reserves to keep the price up... 
@_date: 2013-09-14 19:32:18
the original jalapeno pricing was $149, they honoured it. I remember with fees it was £121 bank transfer.
