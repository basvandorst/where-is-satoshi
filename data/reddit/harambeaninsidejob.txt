Here's why Dash is not better

Fees are not manageable in fact there didn't use to be any fees like back in 2013 before the fee market was established. Satoshi even himself said that there should always be room for free transactions in blocks.

Awesome but I'm going to wait till I can connect to my nearest lightning hub &amp; liquidity provider cause bitcoin is digital gold that belongs in lightning hub bank vaults. Miners are just evil providers of on-chain transactions. Satoshi never said that blocks should always have room for some free transactions. Rather we should use Blockstreams sidechain pegged FIAT assets it makes so much more sense than how Bitcoin has operated for the last 8 years.

Not everything is an attack on Bitcoin the writers are likely just misinformed 
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:10:50
Well core should increase the blocksize now to stop driving away businesses and people with high fees. The lightning network white paper even recommended a blocksize of 133MB for global adoption

Oh lord someone used the word "retarded" get the word police Roger is worse than Hitler. Won't someone please think of the special snowflake children their feelings are getting hurt.

Thanks for correcting me but I'm sure you could tell what I meant though. To some people BCH is not an altcoin the community is split just like ETH &amp; ETC except between BTC &amp; BCH the hostility is much worse.

I don't believe in fake Satoshi I believe in no one. Bitcoin is a trust free system 8mb doesn't prevent me from running a full node I don't trust I verify.

CME has a stake in Digital Currency Group which has a stake in Blockstream do you think Bitcoin got listed on CME out of nowhere? Then Bitfinex has a stake in Blockstream &amp; Shapeshift. The resent rise in tethers being printed and the correlation of tethers in circulation with Bitcoin price is pretty suspicious. Only people who haven't done their homework would think that Bitcoin is still free from corporate control.

It's what CobraBitcoin was talking about on twitter he seems like one of the core insiders since he's co-owner of bitcoin.org &amp; bitcointalk.com 
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:02:14
While CME has a stake in Digital Currency Group which has a stake in Blockstream. Seriously this war is getting sad at this point it's just a battle over which coin has more business ties to get pumped 
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:20:16
Scaling has already been solved by many altcoins it's beyond me why core/Blockstream is stupid enough not to implement any of them. Then again if they don't force people onto their lightning network they can't make profit out of their side chains. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:36:00
Well it's not just Coinbase this happens almost on all exchanges. I've seen plenty of post about different coins being added into website code which hinted at exchange integration. The fact of the matter is this happens in every industry with leaks/rumors like new Apple iphone leaks etc. savvy investors who do their research will have the edge. It's tough for huge companies like Apple to prevent leaks how do you think something like Coinbase could succeed?
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:00:48
I think that's part of the problem maybe many core supporters haven't fully integrated into the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Many of us bitcoiners rely on transactions for daily use. I wouldn't even have a bank account if I could pay my rent using my cryptocurrency credit card or using crypto. The increasing fees is killing BTC for people like me. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:26:21
Yeah sure lets attack the few companies that still haven't abandoned us due to high fees. Like it or not coinbase made it easy for newbies to buy Bitcoin and made bitcoin adoption increase. It's weird how we tend to attack everyone these days
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:49:40
The thing is people who we're in Bitcoin since 2010 would likely say the other sub is not an altcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:39:49
Even for the lightning network to be implemented the blocksize will need to be increased to way more than 8mb just read the lightning network paper. Why core is not increasing the blocksize now is crazy it's just driving away people and businesses right into other altcoins. Like Ethereum has increasing blocksize and performed upgrades fast to scale the network to meet demand. ETH developers have made this possible as they are in better agreement with the miners making system upgrades fast &amp; coordinated. Unlike BTC developers who alienated the miners and part of the community enough to get them to fork off.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:39:52
I imagine most people are in support of a blocksize increase. Yet seems like core is planning to do a POW change as well screwing over all bitcoiners who invested in mining equipment.
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:25:07
Sure and the CME listing of Bitcoin had nothing to do with corporate ties to Blockstream. CME has a stake in Digital Currency Group which has a stake in Blockstream. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:12:39
Most people who do their research saw the posts on reddit how coinbase had added Bitcoin Cash to their API. It was no surprise to almost anyone that they would allow trading soon. But of course to misinformed people like you everything is a conspiracy/manipulation 
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:40:35
I can see your view point about making this space more serious when it comes to such things. But to me cryptocurrency has always been about cryptoanarchy that's how Bitcoin started as and now all of a sudden people want regulations. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 09:03:04
Don't be so sure. I think a good example is how the Canadian government regulated weed setting up licensed shops and ensuring that prices would be the same or cheaper than the blackmarket. With legal grow ops comes better variety and quality as well as reducing crime and access to minors. I could see the governments/UN doing the same with crypto creating a global cryptocurrency that could beat the "blackmarket" cryptos I'm sure they are watching the space and seeing what systems will work. Again I own BTC and support it since I see it gaining value in the up coming years but whether or not it's going to be an experiment that lasts forever and reins supreme I'm less certain 
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:15:10
I'm saying that if crypto really becomes a threat to the governments they would likely create a decentralized fixed supply currency just like bitcoin except legal and supported by all the governments in the world beating the blackmarket currencies 
@_date: 2017-11-11 01:52:15
Well it wasn't in their best interest to legalize weed but they have been forced to do so to curb the black market. Same could happen with crypto. This would solve the problem of cash which is largely used in illegal activity by replacing it with their version of deflationary crypto
@_date: 2017-11-11 01:21:38
Well maybe you are talking about the US government which I'm not a huge fan of regarding their surveillance but many governments don't want war and don't invest heavily into armies or weaponry some don't even have armies like Iceland.
