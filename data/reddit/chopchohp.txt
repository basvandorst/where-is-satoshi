KYC is required for a financial institution, why would they put their business at risk just so you can find your BTC wallet ?
They are not doing it for privacy propagation, they are doing it for business profits. 
If you don't agree with KYC, AML and all the others, then you don't need to do business with those who implement them. 
I don't see your tinfoil hat issue. If you're trading with people on a black list and you get screwed by them, lets see you re-post this then.

$4 billion is a real chunk of change, even in the eyes of JPM! 
Guess they'll be selling their BTC soon to re-coup! But first, they will endorse BTC to jack up the price ofc!

I read this last night and knew this would cause a bit of a shake, but has nobody explained to him how bitcoin works ? Or even a high level overview ?
Sounds more like "Bitcoin is a fraud because everyone has too easy access to it" .. Pure nonsense. Why would he bother commenting on it if he felt it was such a fraud ?
He could have easier sent an internal message to employees:  "We are not trading on BTC". This is manipulation of the market to stockpile them. 
JPMorgan have been known to manipulate Silver commodities: 
This is no different.
