nah bitcoin and the blockchain are really secure and rely on a multimilliion worldwide network of specialized hardware that ensure that everything that happens on the blockchain follows the rules. 
With a computing power in the petahashes/sec it's also the most powerful network know to man.

You're on the rejected list
@_date: 2016-02-18 13:56:14
How much did you lose OP ?
@_date: 2016-02-18 16:38:49
I was making a joke on you being rejected because you couldn't login on the site : )
How much did you lose ?
@_date: 2016-02-18 16:38:04
How many bitcoins are missing ?
@_date: 2016-02-18 17:00:01
I never bought any bitcoins but I find the community interesting.
@_date: 2016-02-19 11:22:52
Imagine if poors could pay others to waste untolds amounts of electricity on mining
@_date: 2016-02-18 13:46:47
You're having a stroke mate
@_date: 2016-02-24 13:05:20
I think no one uses colored coins because they're useless. Maybe some other tech will be more suitable for your project ?
@_date: 2016-09-26 15:03:51
If energy was free and unlimited bitcoin wouldn't be such a massive waste of energy, good point
@_date: 2016-09-15 10:48:10
Just buy the games with normal money ? I don't get it. You'll have to pay for the asic and electricity anyway, unless you're stealing it from your school/employer libertarian style
@_date: 2016-09-26 14:42:06
I remember this story getting posted a while back but who or when I'll never know.
@_date: 2016-09-26 14:48:33
surely you're not a dumb shit asshole op, otherwise lamo
@_date: 2016-09-15 10:56:47
Please keep us updated, becaming a bitcoin house sounds daunting
@_date: 2015-04-01 11:17:46


lol they got that part right
@_date: 2016-10-20 08:55:48
you're angry about buying meth with bitcoin lol
@_date: 2015-03-21 18:18:23
Dude it's fine, just be aware that bitcoin isn't going anywhere. 
It's a really smart thing that doesn't really help with anything.
@_date: 2016-10-12 10:52:11
first they laugh at you,
then they don't fight you
@_date: 2015-03-12 18:51:01
please elaborate on the situation, it depends on a few different things actually
@_date: 2015-03-17 16:08:06
keep your retarded twitter crap format off my reddit thx
@_date: 2015-03-20 06:58:37
How many bitcoins did you lose on evo ? You're acting irrationally
@_date: 2015-03-21 18:06:19
Miners don't want bigger blocks so I guess it's regional altcoins for poors ?
You guys are so desperate for a usecase
@_date: 2015-03-19 15:12:00
yes but bitcoin has _the network effect_
@_date: 2015-03-21 17:49:49
Why do you believe people are going to risk their finances to bitcoin, when they have banks ?
@_date: 2015-03-15 17:05:36
butterfly labs machines don't exist and mining is stupid so no
@_date: 2015-03-17 16:12:18
"the one true value chain"
@_date: 2015-03-23 17:16:35
I wonder if you could get a nicer picture using a thin diffusing fabric between you and the sun, if you were to make other videos I mean.
e: its already pretty good
@_date: 2015-03-12 18:58:56
Do you know how your employer might react if he finds your miners ? It should appear in your calculations.
@_date: 2015-03-19 22:07:13
lol do you think this is doge here
@_date: 2015-03-16 10:21:05
this design is an eyesore, look at those shitty fonts on overcrowded background
@_date: 2015-03-19 22:06:31
gamechanger as in the rich will 50% your network real fast and ron paul you in the dick
@_date: 2015-03-31 17:10:45
pls also bold the relevant parts while quoting bits of the original docs and preserve a lighthearted but serious tone throughout
@_date: 2015-03-19 22:11:46
i think bitcoin dossed your brain
@_date: 2015-03-23 17:20:54
A raspberry pi is less than 50$, so you can buy it directly to actually do something fun and enjoyable
@_date: 2015-03-23 11:37:00
So they are caasscasius coins made by a redditor with a half hour old account who's in talks with secret "no I can't tell you" companies ?
@_date: 2015-03-23 11:47:58
People need to trust you to actually do what you're promising and an established account shows your involvement in the community.
Good luck though !
@_date: 2015-03-21 17:39:31
any car will do
@_date: 2015-03-16 17:12:36
must find new ways to waste free energy, bitcoin
@_date: 2015-03-21 17:57:12
"If bitcoin wasn't what it currently is then it would solve a problem people currently don't have" is what you're saying.
What happens when the 3b unbanked start using bitcoin exactly ? They wait for their turn every few years to fill the 7 tr/sec bitcoin is capable of in optimal conditions ?
@_date: 2015-03-22 12:20:12
that's actually a really good question, the answer is tibanne's
@_date: 2015-03-16 09:05:24
yeah just do a chargeback dude
@_date: 2015-03-15 18:06:07
a thing that happened for sure
@_date: 2015-03-15 17:08:27
borrow a computer and go through [those easy steps](
@_date: 2015-03-19 15:10:57

@_date: 2015-03-22 12:18:59
I am not the evo admin, AMA
@_date: 2015-03-17 08:56:35
I don't understand why virtual people would want actual money
@_date: 2015-03-23 17:11:50
"it's.....it's...a giant fucking behemoth, with a little stick holy shit lift the fees guys"
@_date: 2015-03-17 08:59:03


Are you sure you need bitcoin ?
@_date: 2015-03-16 16:03:15
and all of those people were... very polite
@_date: 2015-03-17 16:08:39
@_date: 2015-03-21 17:45:15
You shouldn't feel so bad, bitcoin isn't going to go mainstream so it's ok.
@_date: 2015-03-25 22:07:17
lol they downvoted you because you're not a belieber
@_date: 2015-03-15 18:00:12
at this point ordering from bfl is borderline crazy
@_date: 2015-03-17 09:02:23
do you know if you're allowed to use this ad ?
@_date: 2015-03-23 10:09:58
Consider this op: you will lose your money, waste your time, and convert useful energy into heat
@_date: 2015-03-10 17:29:01
Look at you trying to discourage people from spreading the good news of bitcoin to their coworkers
@_date: 2015-03-17 16:10:46
"people are able to donate, not me though - my bitcoin work here is done ! Tsscchhhhiou *farts until reaching the chile galt commmune"
@_date: 2015-03-15 17:00:56
If bitcoin is a legit currency it shouldn't be hard to come by
@_date: 2015-03-12 18:50:09
If bitcoin "suceeds" you will be rewarded beyond your wildest dreams as a savvy mid-early adopter ( :
@_date: 2015-03-17 16:11:48
* thing accepts bitcoin (actually accepts bitpay, makes 3 sales in a year)

There's nothing to learn by setting up a miner. 
That's a common thing bitcoiners like to say to sound smart. Do you know how to install a program and boot a computer ? 
Congrats you "learned" how to mine.
