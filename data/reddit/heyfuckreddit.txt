When is the next bump in your IQ?

It's $512 right now what are you talking about? Find something to do and stop watching every minute of price action.

Especially when you only have one basket to choose from. I mean that is a huge part of why Bitcoin is where it is today. For a lot of people there are a shrinking number of options left whereby to protect ones wealth.

I watched it go from $2 to $1145. What's going on now is a non-event to me. This is normal trading. There is always excitement and doubt as Bitcoin continues to succeed and support continues to grow.

This tells me we might see some resistance as a result of long term holders waiting for the first chance to get out.

The question is -- How high will Bitcoin go when all these other bullshit currencies become worthless paper? 1 million per Bitcoin? I remember in the exact same way feeling I was saying something just as outlandish when Bitcoin was $5 and I said it would go to $100 or $1000, and at the same time was doubtful in my own mind, thinking it might happen in 10 years or that I'm completely delusional and it would never happen and I need to get a life. Then it happened within a year.

Big deal, someone else will take their place.
