Congratulations? you just voluntarily threw away one third of your wealth to pay of debts that are deflating exponentially by the minute. 
You're clearly not qualified to give financial advice, a fact that will become painfully clear to you in the coming years.

Big four bank? I've never this expression outside of Accountancy Firms. Why don't you just say HSBC as the other alternatives are the Chinese...
@_date: 2015-06-13 18:07:19
No, work in banking and in my 15+ years no-one has ever, ever said big four, in reference to banks. I'm guessing you don't work in banking and quite clearly do not have a clue what your talking about...
Biggest banks in the world:
Rank	/ Bank name	 / Total assets(US$ trillion)
1 China Industrial &amp; Commercial Bank of China (ICBC)	3.3
2 China China Construction Bank Corporation	2.7
3 United Kingdom HSBC Holdings	2.6
4 China Agricultural Bank of China	2.57
5 United States JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co	2.57

Miners are making a dangerous error in judgement, short term gains for long term loss, both in $ and trust value, the latter being far more important.

The lesson here is; invest in FIAT and, over the medium/long term, you will lose everytime. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 23:53:26
No, wanting a bet that's 100% guaranteed is ridiculous. Give me one example of anything that is 100% guaranteed, you're next breath isn't 100% guaranteed.  You're however correct, invest in something you believe in, invest in something you respect, invest in something you want to succeed more than any selfish monetary reward. Cash rewards are just a bonus....

Our system is corrupt, you know this. Our politicians, even those few who start off well meaning, have to bend to the sponsors who manipulate them, you know this. Our monetary system is engineered to corrupt the masses to the benefit of the few, you know this.  This is a bubble, you think this.

I was a little disappointed at the miners actions, however, the disappointment was born from a feeling they were recklessly harvesting for a quick profit rather than being patient for a greater long term return. The replies I received yesterday made me re-examine my position, I was wrong and thanks to the replies, I was able to upgrade my understanding. 
Miners act out of desire for return of greatest value. If BTC doesn't provide this value then miners will mine elsewhere, and they will mine and mine and mine, saturating the market with the resulting produce until they are forced to chase less and less return of value from an oversupplied market. 
When the time is correct they will come back whether you welcome them or not, and as long as the value is there, will continue to secure the network and confirm transactions to the benefit of everyone.

Do you believe GBP is a long term hold? 10 years ago £1 would get you close to $2, around 1.4 Euros, today $1.3 and 1.1 Euros respectively if you're very very lucky. 
Do you really believe this is going to get better going into Brexit? Anyone bullish long term on GBP must know something people who professionally work in the market don't, I personally would certainly love to know the secret. 
When we're finally forced to raise interest rates and the housing market collapses, In 3/4 years time 1/2 BTC will get you an average priced house (£100k/£150k i.e. 3/4x average salary rather than 8x as it currently stands), £10 will have the purchasing power of £4/5 in todays market. 
Published inflation rates are not to be trusted, manipulated by those in the industry from everyone from Life Insurance companies (pensions increased in line) and company bosses (salary negotiations). 
Everything looks negative for GBP, currently lying on the road after a pounding, Brexit and Inflation will be kicking the life out of it in the next 3-5 years and the EU will be cheer leading in the background as a warning to any other country thinking of exiting.

Incredible news today, girlfriend invested £500 after hearing me endlessly drone on about it over the summer. Even though I'm personally all in, my initial pride in seeing her faith in me turned into fear at letting her down, repeatedly told her it may go straight down, she may lose money, she has to be prepared to wait a long time before she sees a good return. Today her BTC 0.199999 (fees dropped it from 0.2) officially passed £1k total value, 100% return. I swear I was more excited than her.

I don't get it, longer dated notes will be valued higher than shorter notes? Effectively the same value note will hold different values due to the date. This is bizarre

All these blocks being mined with the resulting BCH being dumped on the market, Roger Ver can only dump so many BTC until he's spent. Lets face it, the current BCH holders are not holders, they're value chasers, they'll crumble like a house of cards as soon as they see value elsewhere.

Far more respect for this guy than any 'real' lambo driver
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:52:07
What a load of horsesh!t, the only people who will buy BCH are scumbag value chasers, those same scumbag value chasers will drop it as soon as they see value elsewhere. 
Good luck starting a long lasting community based on those individuals.

Chinese connection is a little far fetched but if you forgive the tinfoil, the general position of the author is correct. Institutions are trying to enter the market and gain strong positions.

Out of interest which bank do you work for? Currently based in Canary Wharf, walking to the pub for a leaving do on Thursday, I overheard people talking about Bitcoin for the 1st time, well, first time a conversation that wasn't initiated by me. 
Would be interesting to hear your personal experiences, I've had a few personal attacks a couple of weeks ago but its been relatively quiet since the major spikes, admitting you believe in Bitcoin is like coming out of the closet in the 50's.
@_date: 2017-10-28 14:16:04
I find it a little strange the chaps holding thousands of BitCoins (apart from notable exception(s)) aren't actively creating/sponsoring competing mining pools.  
Even if they ran at a small loss it would still be beneficial for their own positions. They could diversify but would any other position offer the same potential returns, even close to similar? Not to mention their own personal knowledge and experience within this journey.
@_date: 2017-09-06 07:02:11
Regardless of the price, hopefully soon they'll profit from the lack of delays and fees sending money to their families back home. 
It's unfortunate most of the world can't sit and hold but completely agree with your sentiment, I'm sure they understand the evils of the FIAT system better than most of us. 
Good post.

Very few sell walls in the short term, $72M on bitstamp waiting to buy, never seen it so high, only 1,814 BTC on market, equally extremely low volume on sale. 
Nothing goes up forever but.... while a pullback is inevitable there volume chasing BTC up is pretty staggering. 
As I type a 500 BTC sell wall  appears on GDAX... and suddenly vanishes hmmm

Fluctuations in value is a simple thing for the majority of the world to understand, called currency risk. Don't your portfolios hold UK/EUR stocks that have increased/decreased in capital value but then eroded/benefited by GBP/EUR value? 
The TV example, when you purchased your last TV did you research the cost value in KRW and translate it to USD? Did you then pour over the USD/KRW in the following days to find out if you made/lost money in the transaction?
FDIC insurance or any government back insurance won't mean anything if we experience another banking crisis. Ireland knew this, that's why they guaranteed 100% ONE HUNDRED PERCENT GUARANTEE!!! Sure we'll guarantee all your money, we'll just run the printing presses overnight and on weekends, oh by the way we're only printing on one side of the note, we can double production that way. 
What they do not and will not and cannot guarantee, is the value of cash will be the same as pre-failure.

Bitcoin doesn't have borders, try not to fall into the Jingoistic hole. Bitcoin doesn't care about which country you happened to be born in. Any Government that proposes a government backed crypto deserves to be mocked out of the room.
