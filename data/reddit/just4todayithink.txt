Most crashes follow this trend
They will peak, drop for an amount, create a bear trap, regulate themselves at around 50-70% of their previous drop and then tank. You're a fool to buy right now, and you're a fool if you're holding because the market will regulate itself to the market's mean - which is somewhere in the 1-2k range. 
Edit: It's funny the famous stock market crash of 29' follows what's happening now to the T. It first crashed around 50% of it's value, then created a trap and gained back around 50% of that loss... before tanking below it's mean and taking around 20 years to restore to it's mean. 
We come out of nowhere because you're too busy refreshing coindesk to realize they are broadcasting the tanking on every news station and website today. Good luck when the banks freeze all transactions from 'fraudulent' exchange websites. Better luck finding anyone on local bitcoin with enough cash to pay out even *if* I'm wrong.
If you don't think the government has the power to regulate this (by banning it like some other countries), you are delusional. The government has it's hands on *e.v.e.r.y.t.h.i.n.g* and this will be no different. Once they get their paws on it, it's over.

It follows graphically as well as numerically.. It's going to crash (obviously) the question is if it will dip below the mean. With that being said, each market is different in regards to acting outside forces. Granted, because this is a literal currency, it should more or less relate to pretty much any other market in some way.

Yeah except... in July you didn't see a 45% loss...
So.. it didn't happen in July.. at all... 
I hate when people look at the chart as solely a graphical interpretation of how the market is moving.. without paying attention to any of the many hundreds of numbers all over the graph that actually give you the information you need to know.

I love how people talk like they know. Both of you are wrong, neither of you know.. and most advice here is garbage. I just saw maybe 15 posts.. each time with something like "In 2018, bitcoin will hit 40k!"
Scrolled further down...
"Bitcoin will hit 80k!"
"Bitcoin will hit 100k!"
None of you know. Absolutely none of you.

This guy is a hypocritical douche bag. 
Let’s see how long he supports bitcoin when people start posting right of center, immutable political data on the blockchain ...
