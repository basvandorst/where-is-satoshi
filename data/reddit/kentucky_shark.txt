Theft then
@_date: 2019-07-28 10:10:57
Cool beans, sucks that someone is going to find a way to steal all my BTC during the next declared disaster
@_date: 2019-07-28 00:11:52
if I 'lose' my private keys can I claim the BTC as a loss on taxes?
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:52:51
When BTC hit 10000 I got a text from my IDIOT brother in law 'We're gonna be rich bro!'
This kid is super irresponsible and has at least 10k in cc debt and other loans he refuses to pay on time (He is full time apple genius, so it isn't an issue of income just jackassery) Asshat is like 25 and lives with his recently cancer diagnosed mother. He pays no rent, refuses to clean after himself or do ANYTHING to help his mother with her situation, just a complete leech. She cosigned his loans so he doesn't give af and would rather have new shoes or workout supplements (HE BOOUGHT FUCKING $500+ worth of workout suppliments months ago and he has yet to open tthem apparently)
I told him to pay off debt before he makes risky investments, or any investments for that matter. But no response. He is too full of himself to listen to any reason.
Seriously every breath he takes is a waste of fresh air...
Sorry for the rant, probably not the sub for it, but damn he makes me so infuriated and OP just reminded me of this stupid 'Were gonna be rich bro' text

I was thinking that too, but now that I read your comment I don't think it is so crazy.
He is going to be paid bi-weekly in btc, but his salary is in USD. If the price of btc drops he will just get more btc that paycheck. His biweekly purchasing power should be relatively unaffected regardless of fluctuations in btc (assuming btc doesn't just completely crash into non-existence)
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:41:34
Yes relatively unaffected. Please explain to me how the volatility of bitcoin will affect the purchasing power of 1USD worth of BTC

How is the burden of proof on you in this scenario? I understand that having coins that once were linked to your account might raise the question of 'do they still control the address those coins went to?' But I would imagine actually proving that you control the coins would be the states problem.  
 I'm not even sure how you would go about providing proof of not owning something. 'I would like to submit to evidence this box of nothing, which symbolizes that I do not posses the private keys'   
Imo, for whatever reason, people are foolishly trying to make bitcoin fit in the pre-crypto economic model when they should be trying to come up with new rules/laws that will integrate this new concept into the old systems
@_date: 2017-08-29 17:44:06
What is the value of a USD?
@_date: 2017-11-16 14:23:57
you are REALLY dumb
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:07:08
Wow you truely are dumb as rocks eh? First you say its an argument then you argue it isn't. Make up your mind already and maybe consider reading a book
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:13:13
unless it never reaches that point and instead crashes before you spend it, then you are left with nothing
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:35:17
How does GDAX let you send btc without any fee?
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:36:28
Yup exactly a ponzi/pyramid scheme. The first person needs to wait for the 2nd to get their payout. The 2nd waits for the 4th. The 3rd need wait on the 6th.... and so on. So every time you pay in you need to wait for the user base to DOUBLE in order to get a payout, which boils down to the first half of the people to jump on board scam money out of the idiots that jump in too late
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:13:07
Don't roll in the mud w/ the FUD. If someone wants to learn about how bitcoin is different than traditional currencies I am all for it, but if they are just going to spout a bunch of unresearched/non-sited FUD then just dismiss them and move on w/ your day.
suninabox either truly believes that BTC is some massive scam orchestrated by the cartel, or truly wants others to believe it. Either way it isn't worth trying to correct, you will just get even more asinine responses.
@_date: 2017-11-04 00:38:19
If you were planning on dumping you would be ready with coins on an exchange, but you make a very valid point on the forces at play after the fork
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:35:58
You best be a hodl hooker
@_date: 2017-11-16 15:57:06
It is the only argument a moron understands :)
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:43:47
hopefully not before the price crashes
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:12:57
How would they spin up 2x secretly? nobody would use it if they didnt know the network existed
@_date: 2017-11-16 01:04:41
Digital cash is not cash, it is an iou for cash from a 3rd party. And while it may be just as liquid and probably more convenient than cash it is not the same.
The difference with bitcoin is that the people that profit from processing transactions are not able to freeze/seize your balance, you control the key to that not them.
@_date: 2017-11-08 02:45:59
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:30:04
You should both send 2 btc to a multisig wallet with a 3rd impartial party, that way at the end of the year the winner can claim their bet even if the loser wants to back out
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:16:39
LAWL WHAT A MORON!!!!!!!!!!!
@_date: 2019-01-28 13:15:14
Then maybe OP needs to go back to school and learn to not make a false click bait title.  


FALSE: that is literally the title of the post  
Get off your high horse soap box CryptoNoob, nobody likes you
@_date: 2018-03-28 13:21:26
One way or the other :)
@_date: 2018-03-08 13:21:07
Bitcoin needs not regulation, exchanges could use someone watching them though
@_date: 2017-09-27 11:30:04
publish their public key and laugh when people realize how much btc they have
@_date: 2017-10-24 13:28:39
Do your own research and find out how to secure your own private keys. This will involve buying a hardware wallet or using a software one. Obviously the hardware one is the most simple way to keep the coins secure, however you can still be completely safe with software as long as you stay aware of where your keys are. 
Storing them unencrypted on a pc you download pirated software to is a BAD idea. On the flip side you can store them encrypted on separate media (usb drive) and boot your pc without any network capabilities when you want to create transactions so that your keys are NEVER exposed to the web in any way at all, then you would have to reboot once you have your transactions to broadcast them. The latter is the most paranoid software method, but just about impossible to hack without physically beating you up and taking your jump drives, but even then they would need your encryption password
@_date: 2017-10-24 12:32:31
How do you dump if nobody is buying?
@_date: 2017-10-24 11:30:29
IF YOU DON'T HOLD YOUR KEYS YOU DON'T HOLD YOUR COIN.
I didn't watch but if you are going to buy with coinbase please don't leave it there, send it to your own private wallet
@_date: 2017-10-27 12:20:14
No if this was how open source dev worked then bitcoin would be adopting 2x. Hard forks occur when someone wants to change bitcoin in a way that the community does not agree with, so instead they force it into existence and try to convince the less informed that their coin is the REAL bitcoin
@_date: 2017-10-27 12:21:51
It would be if people could stop being so damn greedy and just use bitcoin instead of trying to abuse it
@_date: 2019-09-02 18:58:43
I got a 2.7 inch epaper hat to mess around w/  
I'm funking with the drivers to make 'quick refresh' calls and the such, you can change the LUT to have the refresh act however you like. You can achieve lighter colors with a partial refresh, me thinks you could even implement some basic greyscale stuff if you played with it enough
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:10:24
I believe so
@_date: 2017-10-24 12:31:53
I have the solution. 
When you want to create a BTG transaction all you need to do is create a transaction as you would for BTC, but instead of signing it as you would a normal transaction you would simply &gt;dev/null and you are done! No broadcasting even required!
Instead of 250 BTG I will accept 2.5 BTC, which given the current futures is very generous
@_date: 2017-10-27 12:25:01
Buy old asic, when the hashrate drops on BTC they will become profitable again and you can support BTC at the same time!
@_date: 2015-03-05 05:12:19
cool beans
@_date: 2017-06-16 12:38:49
I would suggest looking into alt-girlfriends. Don't give up entirely on the og, maybe the alt will help you appreciate what you had to begin with!

AAAAND they want 10yrs experience...
