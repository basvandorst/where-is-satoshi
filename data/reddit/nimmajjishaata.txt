Bitcoin, right now, has better scalability than it had ever before. 
Mainstream adoption is a gradual process just like scalability. There will be points in time where there will be scalability pain.

Evidently you haven’t followed the scaling debate of 2017. Bitcoin scales well right now both on and offchain better than what it did in 2017. 
Several reasons behind it:
1. Segwit is just the first step. 
2. Lightning Network is only becoming more popular.
3. There are sidechains that are functional - Liquid for example and more to come. 
Rome wasn’t built in a day. It is a constant fight to improve scalability.

The understanding that Bitcoin will replace Visa today is totally wrong. You are just not being realistic.
We know that the base layer is not meant to scale. Increasing the block size doesn't seem to help. Lightning is growing and seems to be improving.
I fail to understand what your complaint is. Things don't improve overnight.

ETF, from the perspective of long term adoption, is pure noise. Let it grow organically. It doesn't matter if it takes another decade. The finance folks will come eventually, if they haven't already.

Adam Back explained it on a Twitter thread. Since I can’t find it, I’ll summarize.
The patent expired in 2008. Not only that, there was enough understanding of the challenges of ECDSA and enough libraries available to make the use of ECDSA an obvious choice.
On the other hand, not much of research was done on understanding the impact of Schnorr on real engineering systems. Not many used them because of the aforementioned patent. That is the reason why Satoshi used ECDSA.
Now that the patent has expired and people in the Bitcoin community know that there are other advantages down the line with Schnorr, there is enough interest in using that in BTC. 
@_date: 2018-07-06 22:21:06
Exactly! I think it will swing sideways for at least another year. My guess is we won't see any upwards movement at least till the next halving.
