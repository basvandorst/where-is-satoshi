BTC, mBTC or "bits"?
Has there been any confirmation what kind of unit the community wants to use? We are opening a new Bitcoin-based website and considering the different units. mBTC sounds the most common at the moment. 
@_date: 2014-07-30 16:10:35
We are definitely considering that if there is demand for it.

That's what you get for not being a native speaker. Thanks, corrected!
@_date: 2014-05-14 04:38:43
We are building exactly that at [CoinSierra]( We are getting closer to our launch!

Recommended, I bought a $50 card and received it like in 5 minutes, absolutely great service. The exchange rate seems fine to me, preev.com says $50 card is $54.57, I think it's fair.

Just bought Mass Effect collection, seems legit! Confirmation took ages but finally went through.
@_date: 2015-07-13 16:50:25
That's a great idea, thanks!
@_date: 2012-08-27 17:58:39
It's a tad expensive, but I wish I could be there!

Bought 10BTC at $7.2. Now worth nothing (stolen) thanks to Mt Gox.
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:19:37
Our goal is to have at least 10k user base at the end of Q1/2014.
@_date: 2013-02-12 19:28:11
Since we currently only have a couple of dozen of items, we thought that search wouldn't be necessary just yet. But it is coming, not to worry! :)

Hey guys, love your music, just bought the whole package. Keep on rocking!

I find Coingig to be really buggy and unsecure. Also, I am not quite sure how it works for private users. When I try to register, it only gives me an option to open a "Store". I don't wanna open a store, I just wanna sell some useless shit I have in my closet :P 
@_date: 2013-02-12 19:22:19
Yeah, the system automatically creates an account for the email you provide when you check out. But I also added a link to register on the top bar!
@_date: 2013-11-06 19:09:25
That's truly a shame, I have used their service several times in the past. 
In other news, anyone interested in starting a replacement? :)
@_date: 2013-02-12 19:33:27
You can see the prices in USD, EUR and GBP by hovering the prices. The effect is pretty subtle, I know :)

Sorry if it was not clear, but I am NOT the author of this article! All credit should go to [Nico Garcia, the author of the blog](
@_date: 2013-11-28 07:33:33
In a nutshell, yes. :)

When were building the site, this was one of the biggest concerns we had. The value of BTC seems to fluctuate a considerable amount daily (especially in the past few days, phew!). That's why our site updates the prices roughly once an hour, that should be enough. So don't be confused if you see the price of an item has changed in the same day, it is not an typo :)
@_date: 2013-05-15 17:30:58
Just out of curiosity, which product was this? We are considering adding a letter-sized shipping option, since most of the smaller items like cables and such would fit well in an enveloper.
@_date: 2013-12-02 08:11:14
I think the most official and comprehevensive is the Trade-page on bitcoin.it: 
@_date: 2013-02-13 11:37:26
Alright, we added a spinbox, should be easier now :)
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:25:34
Yeah, either email Mt.Gox or contact your bank if they can reverse the transaction.
@_date: 2013-02-12 19:24:13
Thank you!
I've got to say, I don't quite notice the similarity. The product catalog is similar, sure, but design-wise, it shouldn't be that much alike.
@_date: 2013-10-21 20:44:13
We show all the prices in BTC and in the payment via Bitpay, we don't convert it to anything, it stays BTC all the way. 
@_date: 2013-05-15 14:48:10
*now. Just great.
@_date: 2013-05-15 18:47:14
Well, in that case may I suggest you try again ;) We added the letter shipping option. It should come up if you only have letter-sized products in your cart.
@_date: 2013-02-12 19:26:23
Yes, mobile and tablet functionality was also considered when building the site, thanks for noticing :)
Hmm, you are correct, on the product page you can't currently input the number of items. You can do that though on the Cart-page ("View Cart"-link on the left sidebar).
@_date: 2013-05-15 17:31:35
We have not given a thought to litecoin before. But if enough people request it, we will be sure to add it!
@_date: 2013-02-13 11:41:26
Yes, the US market is huge and we have been thinking about expanding there. Establishing a warehouse there is a possibility, but since our team is currently all in Europe, the expansion can be bit costly and a timesink. But yeah, we are definitely considering it! :)
@_date: 2013-11-19 13:40:08
Just today I was wondering when they were gonna launch this. Awesome work Bitpay!
@_date: 2013-02-12 19:31:50
Hmm, that $329 seems to be US price for iPad Mini. Our prices are EU prices (which includes Sales tax etc). For example, see here on [Amazon's listing for iPad Mini]( which is considerably more than $329.
@_date: 2013-02-12 19:32:52
All our products shipped from the EU, so there is no customs for the orders (and we currently only ship within the EU). All prices include VAT 19,6%.
