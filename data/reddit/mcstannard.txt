No, there is no central point in Bitcoin network. Bitcoin are abstract entities, don't come from any specific place. If you can prove to the network you have done work, you are reward some new Bitcoin. These new Bitcoin come from no where.
The central authority is distributed.... This is the same as saying that every node connected to the Bitcoin network is a part of the central authority.

Explain again why you disagree with my argument. I feel as though you haven't explained. I don't see why increasing the demand for a limited supply currency isn't the same as increasing it's purchasing power.
You probably right, maybe the economics definition of interest is not what I think it is. But I understand mathematics, it's kinda what I do.

It was an idea that first occured to me when reading about Hayek's idea of having banks issue there own currencies with competing interests rates.
It seems perfectly reasonable to have competing proof of work algorithms. It wouldn't even effect the rate of production of blocks or distribution of new coins. If you had n algorithms, each indpendent difficulty would adjust so that blocks are produced at a rate of 10n minutes (assuming equal weight is given to each algorithm).

Mining is an automated process where miners use computers to trial inputs for a SHA256 function. If an output of small enough value, difficulty, is found the miner can produce a block of transactions and broadcast it to the network. If the miner is the first to do so and his block is verified by others, the miner receives a reward from the network for doing provably hard work. The block reward is halved about every 4 years.
No one is doing this work by hand and currently specialised hardware , ASICs, mine very efficiently and have made it difficult for miners using CPUs and GPUs to mine with a profit.
Edit: It is possible to mine in pools to share your mining power with others. If you all find a block together the reward is shared between each other depending on how much work each miner submitted.
@_date: 2013-12-21 01:34:55
It's possible with gold if people accept receipts for gold as equivalent to gold.
Also possible with Bitcoin with the use of off-chain transactions. For example, if people do not verify there is Bitcoin in an address printed on a paper wallet. Also possible if someone selling paper wallets issued multiple wallets with the same keys.

I'm not at all, but you have completely missed the point anyway. Hoarding currency is the same as lending wealth to everyone spending that currency. When any financial asset is taken out of circulation or hoarded, this has the effect of making all the other similar or equivalent assets more valuable. That is simple supply and demand. If there is less supply of an asset but the same demand, the value is higher.
Even if you don't agree with that point, deflation does not cut off the flow capital. What cuts off the flow of capital is not having a medium or means to lend capital. If a bank or other investment institute isn't willing to pay enough to borrow money from people, we shouldn't just make their currency worth less to incentivise people to sell for less. That's essentially dictatorship which doubled down by the fact that banks now have the most significant influence in what parts of the economy are developed (they have everyones savings/ capital to do with as they wish).
Bitcoin and crowdfunding make lending money more efficient. If a group want to develop a technology which could benefit people but not necessarily produce a profit or be economically viable as business product, then we have the ability now to fund them on a peer to peer base. We don't need banks in the middle taking a cut and we don't need banks dictating where investment is made how economies should develop.

@_date: 2013-12-19 17:32:06
Yeah... this theory is very disconnected from reality and shows an obvious lack of understanding of the Bitcoin technology. 
First off capital will always be flowing. People want and need things. People who have no or little savings are not going to wait for their money to worth more before spending They need food and shelter now. Also, we have simple psychology. If people feel richer because their savings or property is worth more, they're are likely to spend some of that perceived wealth. There is already evidence of this within the Bitcoin economy, I'll try to find a source. What is interesting here, is that this is actually the backbone of much policy today. In the UK we inflate house prices to make people feel wealthier to hopefully encourage them to spend some money.
You should do some research into crowdfunding and [Assurance Contracts]( The reason capital would stop flowing with a deflating fiat currency is because other than banks, there has been no way for people to lend money to each other. People aren't likely to give money to bank for free so we "trick" them to with inflation.
Allow me to explain this a little more. Say there existed a project, public or private, that you thought would produce some value or benefit to you. Using Bitcoin it is possible to fund that project without having to sell your money. There is a mutual benefit system, the funder receives the long term benefits of the project and developers receive paid work. Using this model there wouldn't even be a need for the project to be profitable or an economically viable business.

Crowd funding. If a group of people want something, but the idea isn't economically viable as business project, they can give/ invest their money in such a project.

It makes perfect sense. Spending newly created currency is only beneficial if is used to produce new wealth. It's a gamble because no one can predict the future and whether a particular business will produce wealth or not.
@_date: 2013-12-20 01:49:15
Then we come to a disagreement on how money functions. If a pile of currency is taken out of circulation, the value of the remaining currency will rise to a new equilibrium and vice versa.
And as I have explained before, there are other ways to incentivise money lending/ funding. To briefly explain again, there maybe a mutual benefit for someone to fund a project and not necessarily receive a profit on the money lent or even the full amount back. People are already doing this in the form of crowdfunding.

While I see you analogy and have thought of the comparison myself, the reality is completely different. Bitcoin mining pools act with complete transparency and we know exactly how much new Bitcoin they can be rewarded. You cannot say the same for the central banking system. Not even central banks ( FED, BoE) have control of how many new currency can be created. In the UK we don't even have fractional reserve. Banks can create as many new liabilities as they wish.

You may understand Bitcoin as a currency, but do you really understand the technology?
I don't think you understand the capital market effects. Consider this, in  a deflationary currency, you can get 'paid' for work you do by improving the strength/ value of that economy or by increasing the demand for the currency. If you do something which increases the value of the currency, you now have more total purchasing power and a better economy. Obviously you may require some initial capital to do that work, but that can be borrowed with a 0% interest rate if the lender believes you will increase the value of his savings.

ASIC resistance is not the solution. Having specialised hardware is a good thing as it protects from botnet domination.
As a suggestion, instead of switching to another proof of work algorithmn, introduce multiple. For example, 50% of the blocks produced by SHA256 proof of work and 50% by scypt. This would prevent either large SHA256 or scrypt miners dominating block production,

Multisig transactions allow for more than two parties in a transaction.
For example, consider an escrow situation where a buyer may want the opinion of an expert on a particular product. Bitcoin from the transaction 'hangs' until the third party comfirms the qualiy of a particular item of rejects it as a fake. In this situation the third party cannot claim the Bitcoin as his own but decides which of the other parties shall recieve it.
Another example is a "wallet protection service" (WPS). It's possible to set-up a wallet in which two parties must sign transactions to enable Bitcoin to be spent.

Can you explain that? That sounds like a problem with the current banking system and closely linked monetary policy.

The best thing advice I have is to educate yourself about Bitcoin and it's long term value. Then you can make your own choices about buying Bitcoin.
[These]( videos are great resources for you start and inspire yourself. Bitcoin is so much more than a digital currency.

Yeah, didn't consider the influx of new mining clients. This could get accepted relatively quickly.

I have just briefly read the Proposed Rules section of the SEC article on crowdfunding. A little disappointing to see they have such tight restrictions.

Maybe my opinion is wrong here, but you have proven you do not understand Bitcoin in our other discussion.
You cannot dispute that if hoarded a large amount of dollars, that would increase the value of everyone else's dollars (assuming that the total amount of dollars stayed the same over this period, which I know is not the reality). That is simple supply and demand.

Bitcoin is not anonymous, nor was it designed to be. However, it does have the property of pseudonymity. Depending on how you obtain Bitcoin, it can be impossible to trace it to you (e.g. bought with cash ). If it was discovered that you owned a particular private key corresponding to an address, anyone could see your history on transactions.

This is misinformation spread by Thomas Gullen. Bitcoins are not vouchers issued from a central authority.

There has been a number of discussions over at [These]( are some of them.

Something to consider is that all the miners are currently SHA256 miners. It is really only the miners who have a say in what changes are accepted by the network. I'm not sure how one would get this new design accepted by the majority.

With the invention of Bitcoin, there is no need to wait for politicians to reform the banking system.

Not at all.... I'm sorry but you obviously do not understand how Bitcoin works. Each pool in [this]( chart is rewarded new Bitcoins from a protocol, a mathematical equations controlled by no one. The amount of Bitcoins they are rewarded is directly proportional to the percentage of the total network hashrate they control.
The creation of new Bitcoin is deliberately controlled and limited. They cannot be counterfeited because the blockchain has a complete and accurate record of all Bitcoin transactions between different addresses.
