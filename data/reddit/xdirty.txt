Yum you are very insightful, don't listen to these people with their stupid "raise your self from your own bootstraps" republican mentality

Beautiful picture. I dont think bitcoin was made to be a currency for a whole country, but it can be good for the people to use until greece establishes the new drachma.  
@_date: 2015-06-13 12:22:55
Hes making a joke you didn't get. There was a topic a few weeks ago about i believe it was a bank that said they dont like bitcoin but they like the block chain.

Im not a bitcoin fan boy,  but why does anyone listen to this idiot? What has this guy accomplished thats so great, that we should follow him as if hes the voice  of reason.  Peter schiff  is exactly whats wrong with the economy today, hes your typical republican,  capitalistic, i dont want to pay taxes , winner takes all, douche. Hes never predicted anything worth mentioning,  yet i keep seeing  people post his videos as if hes some kind of god of economics and we should  all listen  to what he has to say.

What's reddits opinion of this guy? I read his wiki page and it sounds like he barely did anything wrong and he was just made an example out of.

Why do we quote satoshi like hes some kind of god or something? Who cares what he said, hes just a person like me an you. He could be right and he could be wrong on somethings. We need to do what makes sense.

Nitrogensports has the best support ive ever seen in a company, period. I had an issue withdrawing my money and they resolved in less than 5 min after emailing them.
@_date: 2015-11-03 03:25:42
i kinda prefered it when it was around the 240 mark, it was stable for a while and i think thats bitcoin needs more than anything. This worry's me again.
@_date: 2017-05-14 03:44:20

They actually voted to refuse the current bailout terms at the time, then tsipras accepted way worse terms. They did not vote to default and leave the euro

Ive been selectively betting on MMA matches to recover some of the money I lost when the price crashed. Im very close to getting all my money back. BTC betting is pretty nice. nitrogensports.eu is where i go and i only had an issue once and they resolved in  less then 5 min after i emailed them. ive never seen speedy support like that.

What about LTC? Segwit exists already and lighting soon, ltc is a clone of bitcoin only has some new features.
@_date: 2017-06-05 17:23:42
So was bitcoin for the longest
@_date: 2017-06-12 15:28:52
Litecoin is basically bitcoin with segwit. I have some money in litecoin hoping things take off.
@_date: 2017-06-12 15:38:36
Then litecoin would be even better than bitcoin
@_date: 2013-09-21 04:06:08
Then this is where i made my mistake, now it makes sense, thank you
@_date: 2013-09-21 03:24:50
I still dont understand how the amount  was not taken into consideration, how do you only give someone 6% of the amount transferred and use 94% as a transaction fee
Me using bitcoinget was not about money, it was just the easiest way to get bitcoin fast. Also i was not expecting 6 cents, i was expecting 56 cents to watch 4 videos or whatever it was.
Im disappointed honestly, you said it typicaly charges 0.001 btc but i was charged 4 times that amount for a small amount transaction and 94% of the money transferred were kept, do you not see anything wrong with that ?
i dont think i like bitcoin anymore
@_date: 2013-09-21 04:07:59
i will give it another chance as i made the mistake, the site sent me what i was suppose to get which was 6 cents, i was just under the impression that it was suppose to be some 60 cents because i did not convert micro bitcoin correctly 
@_date: 2013-09-21 04:00:26
I figured out the mistake with the help of a redditor above, i calculated micro bitcoin wrong, i received what i was suppose to receive.
@_date: 2013-09-21 03:57:58
okay, so i was told by the site that i would receive 510 µBTC, how much is that in bitcoin ? i was under the impression that its around 62 cents. Did i calculate it wrong ? 
@_date: 2013-09-21 02:59:32
So i made an account at blockchain and im trying to learn about bitcoin. I watched some videos for free bitcoins at bitcoinget just to have some I was excited cause with my calculations i should have had around 56 cents in bitcoin. Instead I got 6 cents and around 50 cents went to fees
I dont know much about bitcoin and i was just wondering if im interpreting this correctly  
@_date: 2013-06-07 12:43:55
This is not true, Dropbox detects blocks on a truecrypt file
@_date: 2013-09-21 03:32:34
yes, i was afraid to put it out publicly cause i didn't know if it was confidential.
Does this help
@_date: 2013-09-21 03:48:55
perhaps technically it was the sender thats charged but in the end the fee came out of my portion of the transfer. Had it not been i would have had 56 cents worth of bitcoin. Its almost like i was sent a money order but part of the fee was taken out of the check instead of paid by the person buying the money order in the first place
@_date: 2013-09-21 03:25:41
i set it on blockchain.info to the lowest possible and that still happened
