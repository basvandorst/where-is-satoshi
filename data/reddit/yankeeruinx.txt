It’s non-custodial so don’t need to worry about that you always have full control over your private keys and assets. 
The collateral I was on about was for XSN masternode holders that are funding the channels and running the services using there MN collateral but if you just want to use the services and just use BTC or whatever your favourite assets are then that’s no problem you never need to touch XSN and just use whatever you want too as you aren’t running a MN ��

It has built in 1 click TOR Privacy activation so that’s that bit checked off. I’m sure the community will let everyone know if there is any issues with the other things during testing.

So it’s a Multicurrency wallet first and foremost. However what Stakenet are doing is hosting the various blockchains on their MN network so they don’t need to be downloaded in the wallet, instead the wallet just syncs up with the blockchains on the MN’s. That keeps the wallet lightweight and fast.
Next it has built in TOR privacy so you can activate that with 1 click if you want and that will work for all assets.
Then it also has Lightning Network support, again they are using their MN network to host Lightning Nodes for the assets that support it and using MN collateral to provide liquidity in the channels.  You will then be able to use their Lightning Swap tech to convert assets instantly in wallet or even during payment. The idea being that with this you can pay any retailer that accepts BTC with any asset supported in the wallet and during payment the asset would be converted into BTC for the retailer.
That ties in with the DEX, the DEX uses the same Lightning Swap tech to facilitate trades instantly and again this is all in wallet so you don’t need to send you assets anywhere. The DEX will entirely be hosted on the MN network to ensure it is decentralised.
For you guys here though most of that probably won’t interest you but if you just want to store, send, receive BTC and use the TOR privacy and Lightning Network for it then that’s absolutely fine ⚡️��

They are planning to do side by side comparison videos of their Lightning Swap tech vs Atomic Swaps to show the difference and how fast they are.
They are using the same tech for their DEX which will be built into the wallet ⚡️

Link to the dev update where it was posted: 
Supposed to have the Android build out next week for public testing
@_date: 2019-02-15 20:02:20
There is an article here that outlines it:
They finished internal testing and now moving to public testing starting with community members and then scaling outwards.

Stakenet are doing this all in one with their Multicurrency Lightning Wallet. DEX built directly into the wallet using their Lightning Swap tech. They already have one click TOR activation up and running and more privacy features are coming for BTC and any other currencies they support with the wallet.

This one isn’t going to be once released and will be posted on the github for inspection/scrutiny. So just wait until it’s all up there and been verified before using it if you are interested ��

Stakenet are building an entire DEX on LN so soon you will be able to do it directly from their Multicurrency Wallet.

Sent you a DM with link to discord ��

I have a friend that works for Altcoin magazine if thats any use. He said to send you the discord link if you are interested.

XSN just released Lightning Swaps on mainnet so they can massively help with Lightning Network adoption.

Lightning Network is going to have a good year this year I feel.

BTC will recover just not today but one day it will, it always does

No POSW was a centralised staking website for multiple coins and the website got hacked, nothing to do with Masternodes. Much like when an exchange gets hacked.
@_date: 2019-01-28 17:54:51
They have a network of nearly 2000 masternodes and it’s not a new coin as it was a coin swap from POSW. When POSW got hacked this new dev team took over towards the end of 2017 and everyone could swap their POSW for XSN. They had to swap from POSW to implement new protocols and also their TPoS tech they developed and lay the foundations for their plans for LN.
Edit - they also just announced first round of testing on the Multicurrency Light Wallet is complete and they will have a public test ready for early Feb so you won’t have to wait long to see if it’s all pie in the Sky I guess

By stepping down he is limiting his personal liability so probably still on the table to be fair

Stakenet is building an exchange using LN by implementing Lightning Swaps. They have already successfully completed Lightning Swaps on their mainnet between XSN and LTC which are open to the public to try. Naturally BTC and other LN coins will be compatible.

Not submarine swaps but a project has Lightning Swaps that they are currently coding down to a 1 click in wallet solution. They already have it running on mainnet for anyone that wants to try it but it’s a bit techy hence the 1 click solution.
They are building a Multicurrency Light Wallet so you can easily do the swaps over LN and also using the same tech to build an in-wallet DEX. Pretty interesting stuff and should make using BTC over LN really easy, can read about it here:

This will be great for Lightning Network as a whole and everything that uses it.
@_date: 2018-12-25 15:48:26
Stakenet will achieve it with their Lightning Network running on their MN network, they currently have 1900 Masternodes which will be Lightning Nodes for XSN using the MN collateral for capacity and liquidity of the channels. At current price this would give them around $3.5M in capacity. 
They have also built in 1 click Lightning Swaps and will host other blockchains on the network so when their new multicurrency Light Wallet releases you will be able to use Lightning Swaps to Swap between BTC/LTC/XSN at launch. They will keep adding more chains to the network so you will be able to store/send/receive/swap between them effortlessly.
Here is an article about it:
What they are building for Lightning Network is going to be great for everyone and should massively help with adoption hopefully.

Works super fast for me in the UK, transfers from CB to my bank within a few hours max

Well you don’t really need their token to be honest. Every service they run on their MN network like Lightning Swaps, DEX, DApps, privacy features etc will be paid for in XSN in one way or the other and distributed to the MN holders but the actual user doesn’t need to hold XSN for that to happen. 
You can make a swap from say BTC to LTC and a small fee will be collected in BTC but then that BTC will be swapped to XSN and distributed for example.

Stakenet are working on a unique solution for Lightning Network. They are releasing their multicurrency Light Wallet which you don’t download the blockchains for. The blockchains are hosted on their MN network and you interact with them via Lightning invoices. In turn the MN Network also host LN channels for the network and utilising their Lightning Swap tech people will be able to pay/transact in anything. 
Point is people can use this Light Wallet to accept LN payments easily in Bitcoin or whatever else is supported so hopefully that will help with adoption.
