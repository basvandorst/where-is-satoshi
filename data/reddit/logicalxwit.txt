Til sweeping generalizations speaking to the motivations of other people aren't 100% true.

I see, just import the private key, without software to generate a secure password I used brain wallet to create my key. The pass phrase I'll never remember as I maxed out the input field with random garbage. I just stored the address and key generated in a safe location. Is there a better way ?

My big concern with the blockchain wallet I have is that it was generated and given to me by a bot.

This is the first time I've ever considered buying bitcoin. I've been following the movement and bitlisten and such, just kind of spectating but I really like this idea. I've got no idea how to purchase Bitcoin without leaving a trail of how and who they were purchased by.

The only wallet I was familiar with was my bit tip wallet and I received notifications to move my coin out. I didn't understand about getting another address and wallet all together from blockchain so I used brain wallet.
