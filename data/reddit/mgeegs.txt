Really? You're not even going to try and set the tone? They'll interview bitcoins detractors anyway...

I've bought from localbitcoins.com and coined.co.nz

You go teach them then. Why does a bitcoin meetup have to?

The undertone you have there is that 'females' aren't normally logical or rational. 
Also you weren't accused of being touchy feely. Just sexist.
I agree with antonivs above - it wouldn't gave been in her best interest to call you out. How would you have reacted? Would you have thought to yourself that she was acting crazy or irrational? 
I think you need to reflect on some of the assumptions you make about people. That, or work on filtering what you say at least. I have a feeling that you might often make people uncomfortable and believe it or not but most of them will just go along with it until they can leave, in order to avoid making it worse.

I get why it's not possible now, but at some point it's going to have to be easier to buy bitcoin if we want everyone and their grandma using it.

Was that really btc-e's fault?

I bought btc on localbitcoins then just transferred the btc to the exchange for trading.

Can everyone in this thread have a bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-11-28 06:24:21

What's your time zone?
@_date: 2013-11-20 08:04:47
Where are you seeing it at 25?
