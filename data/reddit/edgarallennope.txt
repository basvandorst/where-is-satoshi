This.  Especially when most of the purchases with bitcoin are illegal. Bitcoin needs some legitimate companies to use it; otherwise, it's just going to keep being contraband/investment coin.

It's a pretty arbitrary number when you think about it. If you used a different numbering system, the number would be insignificant.

No man, the slight increase in prices is definitely permanent. There's no risk of the price dropping again.

It's still a bubble.  The nasdaq is higher than it was before the dot com bubble, does that mean it wasn't a bubble?  You can call it a burst, you can call it a correction, but it's still a bubble.

That's a bunch of BS. Of all the questionable but legal ways to circumvent the law, I would have thought this would be legal.

I don't see what's wrong with trickling the funds out.  If you blow it all in a short period, you're not going to have any more to give, and as time goes on, people won't be donating as frequently.

You mean like a marginal tax rate?
How about we implement a flat tax.  It's a whole lot more simple.  Better yet, keep the 1% that way no one can make more than $1,000,000/year

It can be a good "investment", but its instability makes it a bad currency.

You're not wrong. Do you want to idiots on CNN like AC or Piers Morgan reporting on the dangers of bitcoin?

Thanks!  I know there is some overhead, but I don't think it's enough to justify how little went to those people. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 05:32:13
I'd cash out at least a quarter of that.

Guys, just donate directly to the Red Cross.  You don't want to be fucking around with this shit.  That's how people get scammed.

How do you know?  What is a p currency?

Shit man. That's insane. That guy must feel great right now. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 05:35:05
This kinda makes me upset.  I'm feeling feels like I've never felt before.
@_date: 2013-12-12 05:34:04
So you don't spend money on anything unless it's an investment?
@_date: 2013-11-22 01:18:15
If I'm even dealing with $50 I'm checking and double and triple checking that shit.  Let alone $10k+
@_date: 2013-10-16 19:08:22
Oh, you must be a fascist.

I better buy a bitcoin then!
@_date: 2013-11-21 07:34:25
What?  I don't have any bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-22 01:16:53
How can you tell how much he has based on the link OP posted?
@_date: 2013-10-16 19:00:04
No it's not. 


@_date: 2013-12-12 05:29:48
He seems pretty irresponsible if you ask me.
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:30:12
Boy I bet he's pissed. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 00:36:05
lol, you think this isn't a bubble?
@_date: 2013-12-12 05:33:06
Implying he can't afford that.
@_date: 2013-11-13 23:00:48


Expand on this.
@_date: 2013-10-16 19:04:41
Nope!  Can't do that!  It's illegal because it makes Big Brother uncomfortable not being able I see what you're doing at all times!
@_date: 2013-11-21 00:38:21
lol no he won't.  It'll level back off at no more than $300.
