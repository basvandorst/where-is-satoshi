But if I send it off to the wallet then it is just sitting there right?
If I send it off coinbase to a wallet it's no longer on the market?

Watch the series its fantastic, aggravating, and shocking...
Very complicated contracts were signed that even lawyers had trouble dissecting that basically held these poor people accountable for 4-5 times the money loaned...

Yea I agree with that but the reason this particular quote strikes a chord with its audience is because it holds more truth than false...

I like the quote...and it holds some truth...just yesterday I was thinking about the Dirty Money series on Netflix about that scumbag "legal" loan shark that used Indian reservations to funnel money...he ruined countless poor people's lives because of his greed. 
Obviously I hold the poor people responsible for being dumb enough to believe the loan would come without any strings attached but I think as a society this quote is relatable...

Not true...but okay guy.
It really isn't THAT broad...rich people getting rich off of poor people is not a new concept or business model, it has been used and abused for a long time.
