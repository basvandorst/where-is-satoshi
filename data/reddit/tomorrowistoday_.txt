The limits are different, coinbase allows you to buy and sell more but its usually not instant. Circle has lower limits but you can buy with a credit card.
@_date: 2014-09-29 15:51:11
Yeah me too :( And I had sent quite a lot of bitcoin I had bought on a local exchange there so I want to move it out of circle to a hard wallet before it goes down completely :(
@_date: 2014-09-13 07:55:43
Oh that's good. I didn't realize that. :-)
@_date: 2014-09-13 04:15:09
Yeah me too!
@_date: 2014-08-31 00:15:26
Doesn't Open Bazaar start today?
@_date: 2014-09-13 08:53:34
Is there an address we can donate to you? :)
@_date: 2014-09-13 09:01:12
I buy with credit card regularly with circle.
@_date: 2014-09-29 15:52:31
All the beta testing and still not ready for prime time. Rather disappointing. :(
@_date: 2014-09-06 19:18:44
Yes I always use copy and paste. . . but if it's not on the same device that is tricky :(
@_date: 2014-08-24 13:37:19
San Francisco Open Exchange. They say they will work in all 50 states.
@_date: 2014-08-24 12:52:35
San Francisco Open Exchange will be a huge thing when it opens up. It will be the first ACH state-side exchange.
@_date: 2014-08-29 14:23:01
If they had a mac version I'd read it!
@_date: 2014-09-06 12:29:46
I put any money I don't need in the next month into bitcoin. . . my expenses in general are pretty low because I live rather frugally. . . so I don't mind holding and don't really mind if the price is volatile.
@_date: 2014-09-10 18:49:35
Yes same for me, actually. I buy whenever I can and since like you I get payed in intervals, I also buy in intervals. I can't believe it's been so low so long, but since it is I'm trying to take advantage of this time as much as I can.
@_date: 2014-08-24 12:56:01
I admire your courage!
@_date: 2014-09-23 18:49:42
Priceless, just priceless
@_date: 2014-08-27 12:52:10
Is there a Bithub or TipforCommits for Open bazaar where can donate bitcoin to the developers?
@_date: 2014-08-27 10:26:12
Eventually (a few years max) you shouldn't have to 'sell' your bitcoin, instead you can just use it naturally to buy anything you would like to buy (products or services).
@_date: 2014-09-11 20:37:36
 Yeah, in the Netherlands they already had very easy ways to buy bitcoin. . . so I'm not sure it changes the deal that much.
@_date: 2014-09-07 17:11:23
I'm sure remittance would be a huge thing as 80% of the workers in Saudi Arabia are foreign workers.
@_date: 2014-08-29 21:18:46
How much are they giving to each person?
@_date: 2014-09-15 03:39:38
@_date: 2014-09-13 05:05:29
YES and they aren't getting nervous (at least I'm not.)
@_date: 2014-09-23 19:41:36
Yeah my thoughts exactly.
@_date: 2014-09-04 20:44:38
Yeah I'm rather surprised that it hasn't affected the price at all.
@_date: 2014-09-06 21:50:47
I think two of the things that I've learned about life is that one it's very short. We have only seventy or ninety years if we are very strong at the most.  The question I always ask myself is -- if my life here is so short, what in the universe is eternal? And how can I cherish and support that which is eternal?
The second thing I've learned is the importance of love in life. . . It sounds corny like a Disney movie, but love can really work miracles. . . and when people sacrifice for each other and give to each other and love each other and honor each other then, often in the beginning slowly and almost imperceptibly, then something changes in the air. People who are unsociable and cranky and annoying to everyone around them change when they are really and truly loved.
@_date: 2014-09-07 23:34:13
Yes I'm using it as well. I particularly find the buy with credit card option helpful even though there is a little bit of a fee added on to it.
@_date: 2014-08-27 04:41:48
Pretty cool stuff!!!! :-)
@_date: 2014-08-27 04:30:42
Wow, I didn't realize these things. The prosecutor's malfeasance should be more in the the media.
@_date: 2014-09-30 20:56:49
maybe on local bitcoins :-)
@_date: 2014-09-04 20:39:12
my question exactly
@_date: 2014-09-29 15:55:10
No it's down. . . Schedule maintenance they say kk
@_date: 2014-09-13 19:46:26
Yes Sweep those addresses. And never use those addresses again. They've been compromised.
@_date: 2014-09-29 15:51:47
Yeah they must have too many people signing up.
@_date: 2014-09-04 19:09:58
Wow pretty cool. It's nice to hear people are using it.
@_date: 2014-08-26 15:18:59
Even though it's from 2013 people BitHub is still being used, both to donate to Open Whisper Systems and to pay for people making their secure open source projects. The payout is a lot more than Tips4Commit -- so I think it's used a lot more.
Someone just recently donated 5k and I've donated as well recently. We should all donate! :-)
@_date: 2014-08-24 11:19:52
There will also be Darkmail. . and Open Whisper Systems is working on lots of nice apps -- these will allow people to communicate and send private messages about what they want to transact (or private keys) so much easier. I think the more people use those kind of software the more they'll be open and eager to use libertarian money (ala bitcoin) as well.
@_date: 2014-08-24 09:29:32
Yes, I'm not sure about that. It is good news that they extended the comment period though (and that people like the Circle CEO have been so vocal against it).
@_date: 2014-08-24 09:58:11
Will Maidsafe really be ready in the next few months?
@_date: 2014-08-24 13:35:59
Any idea when this will be in open beta?
@_date: 2014-09-10 19:15:22
One very smart guy!
@_date: 2014-09-04 20:17:33
If it's connected with Open Bazaar perhaps that would be the best?
@_date: 2014-09-07 23:29:20
Use Circle
@_date: 2014-09-07 23:32:47
What's the address you sent it to?
@_date: 2014-09-30 07:59:55
Use Circle to get coins and blockchain.info to hold them (with 2 factor authentication)
@_date: 2014-09-06 19:17:59
Wow very cool :-)
@_date: 2014-09-22 19:56:33
Wow They're lucky.
@_date: 2014-09-13 08:58:20


Where is the link for this? The only place I could find the last commits were several months ago.
@_date: 2014-09-05 17:40:40
Wow. This is worse thank banks :(
How many bitcoins did you move off coinbase?
@_date: 2017-03-20 08:49:32
Isn't Trezor completely open source?
@_date: 2017-03-17 07:09:00
People argue Trezor is safer because it doesn't have a secure element -- absolutely everything is open source. Naturally Ledger nano s fans think a secure element is safer.
@_date: 2017-03-20 08:41:37
what hardware wallets did you use and why?
@_date: 2017-03-21 11:59:28
I will too.
@_date: 2017-03-19 10:33:39
 this has some useful info clearing up misconceptions
@_date: 2017-03-18 03:40:57
Opening yourself up to lawsuits there.
@_date: 2017-03-10 09:00:33
buy.bitcoin.com works with a credit card but i think the minimum amount is 120$
@_date: 2017-03-12 10:17:33
Not too surprised sadly.
@_date: 2017-01-08 12:36:55
 is also a good option if you want to buy bitcoin with a credit card.
@_date: 2017-01-04 12:54:31
There are also other options that some mining pools are using to increase the bitcoin block size. If other mining pools join them, we might really go to the moon!
The more people can transact effortlessly with bitcoin, the higher the demand for bitcoin will be, and the high the price of an individual bitcoin will be.
@_date: 2017-01-04 13:55:35
@_date: 2017-01-04 12:58:27
@_date: 2017-01-04 13:15:24
what ath are you using?
@_date: 2017-01-02 05:32:31
It's been a problem for a while. Those kind of bugs take ages for them to fix though.
@_date: 2017-01-07 14:07:57
Or bigger blocks. Local bitcoins just made me pay around 58 cents for a transaction.
@_date: 2016-12-05 14:59:34
Great introduction! Thanks for sharing.
@_date: 2016-12-16 11:28:41
 is a good site. There is a fee there as well.
Coinbase is probably the cheapest coinwise.
@_date: 2016-12-22 15:03:48
It probably depends how well and fast we scale. 
@_date: 2016-12-07 06:18:01
What? I use it all the time for btc related stuff. :(
@_date: 2016-12-02 06:15:11
I do whenever I can! It's the best!!!
@_date: 2016-12-23 22:45:39
they (meaning another well know exchange) recommended 45 cents just now. This is too high :(
@_date: 2016-12-07 13:41:09
Same here.
@_date: 2016-12-23 02:15:02
Have you had any concerns by workers about lack of privacy (because you can see exactly what they do with their money)? Or do all of them use a third party to hold the coins, like coinbase?
@_date: 2016-12-03 23:10:57
You can actually. Buy buying somebody's products on amazon and sending it to them and them sending you the bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-12-16 07:07:59
Charles Schwab accounts also reimburse debit card fees -- another good choice if you're based in the States.
@_date: 2016-12-16 11:29:43
 offers a better rate actually. (Even though a lot worse compared to buying on the exchanges directly.)
@_date: 2016-12-21 14:06:08
Yes, exactly. I guess to put it more concisely -- when generating a passphrase with dice are we stuck in using list with 6^5 words or a  list with 6^6 words?
 Is there any way we can securely use a word list that is bigger than 6^5 words and less than 6^6 words?
@_date: 2016-12-02 04:08:48
the best place that doesn't ask for ID verification is purse.io or local bitcoins
@_date: 2016-12-04 10:46:12
Interesting thoughts. I think the whole idea of an ethical hashrate requirement is ridiculous (except maybe for soft forks, which is one reason imho that hard forks are preferable to soft forks).
Whatever will work free-market wise should be ethical. 
@_date: 2016-12-03 23:13:53
There's actually more debate about whether segwit softfork is a healthy or needed at this time than meets the eye. A little bit of googling or searching at some of the bitcoin forums might turn up some answers why people are reluctant to change to this radical new way of doing bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-12-22 17:10:03
Do you have any plans to improve the privacy of bitcoin users who use the app, perhaps with coinmixing or support for stealth addresses?
@_date: 2016-12-07 14:31:52
This needs to be translated into Chinese and sent to all the miners.
@_date: 2016-12-28 02:02:49
@_date: 2016-12-05 14:09:07
Use a Trezor! They're the best! You won't get hacked if you use one of those.
@_date: 2016-12-04 08:44:44
It's actually better this way. Mining pools are using alternative clients and we getting a decentralization of developers which is probably one of the most important decentralizations.
@_date: 2016-12-13 02:25:12
I like the Trezor. For one, it's completely open source (versus the ledger which has a blackbox secure element that is closed source).
@_date: 2016-12-28 07:03:17
Pretty strict KYC, including uploading IDs and often proof of residence.
@_date: 2016-12-13 02:38:16
I like the Trezor. For one, it's completely open source (versus the ledger which has a blackbox secure element that is closed source).
@_date: 2016-12-05 14:24:58
I would get a little more just to be on the safe side :P
@_date: 2016-12-01 13:31:27
Yeah I really like using multiple accounts -- used them in Dark Wallet and Blockchain.info and of course Trezor :(
@_date: 2016-12-07 06:29:30
I buy bitcoin in the country where I work, send it to Circle and then deposit it straight to my account.
I can still get bitcoin (with a bitcoin address) and cash out in a local currency. Will that change? IN that way Circle is serving as rails, and not as an exchange.
I really wish that doesn't change. It's much more convenient (and honestly better prices) than coinbase.
@_date: 2016-12-03 23:11:47
Jihan Wu is definitely one of my favorite bitcoin advocates. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 16:57:56
Bithumb (one of the top three bitcoin exchanges in the world) is listing BCC  and they say in their recent press release that they support the fork.
Would be very good to know what the stances of other exchanges are.
