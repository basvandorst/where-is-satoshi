That is indeed interesting. It's possible that this is neither Cryptsy nor Bitfinex wallet, rather, some kind of BitGo Instant wallet used by multiple exchanges for instant transactions between themselves.

FYI: That risk is almost entirely eliminated by margin calls. The borrower needs to deposit a margin balance, and the exchange forcibly liquidates his assets before the remainder of the borrowed money together with the borrower's margin balance is less than what was initially borrowed. In theory, if the order book is becomes completely empty as in the case of a flash crash, the borrower can default since the liquidation of his assets has no buyer. But this is a very small risk and does not support the high interest rate, although it is more common on exchanges that offer higher leverage (Bitfinex offers 3.3x, OKCoin offers 20x). On Bitfinex, the interest rate primarily accounts for the risk of the exchange defaulting, not the borrower, and the recent transpired events are the evidence as to why.
Source: Am trader, this is how I account for margin lending risk.

So what's the relevance for allowing users to access their balance to see whether their account was affected by the hack. How is that information interesting and worth getting the site online for, if it has no bearing on whether they will eventually be able to withdraw those funds or not?

A (bitcoin) blockchain is a database where you can rely on the records/entries to be legitimate since falsifying them is expensive and requires consensus. The older an a entry is, the more expensive it becomes to manipulate it.
In a traditional database, the records can be manipulated by the administrator of the database at will.
As you can imagine, for a currency system where no one should be in control, we can't use a traditional database where someone has admin access. We use a blockchain.

Could not agree more, thanks for saying this. Hopefully the Bitcoin community will stop being so anal about this soon.
While I have your attention: regarding your EPOBC-implementation of Colored Coins, this implementation employs the nSequence-field to define transactions. However, the new CSV opcode also utilizes this field. Does this impact EPOBC at all?

I have identified [this]( as a Bitfinex wallet (it's a BitGo wallet where the change seems to go to after withdrawals). It's some sort of hot wallet. What strikes me as interesting is the last address it withdrew funds to right before they shut down today: [1FuckUpmVUxwHZH1vkLNkEYB8dTvsS782E]( This "FuckUp" wallet was created 2013-08-27, around when Bitfinex stared I think? I'm not sure what this means but atleast I'm pretty sure that somehow, Bitfinex has fucked up.
Google tells me it's associated with user [allyouracid]( on bitcointalk, who is in turn associated with ["BitShit Trading &amp; Analysis"](

Sorry for idiotic response on beforehand.
The earliest mention of "side chain" I've found is by Nakamoto in a thread on Namecoin where the hash of Namecoin blocks were included in the coinbase of a Bitcoin block to facilitate merged mining, however in order to do so, Bitcoin miners must actively place those hashes in Bitcoin blocks. So you can indeed have a sidechain system that involves incorporating needed Bitcoin miner collaboration.

When you say "between the two of you, you keep an ongoing record of your balance". I'm assuming this "ongoing record" is managed using a far easier approach than a blockchain technology.  And that's possible since the transactions between only two parties (instead of an entire payment network) are easy to manage. So LN is a way of bringing a multitude of transactions between the same two users off-chain as a method to increase the speed of the transactions and off-load the blockchain? Am I getting it right? 
@_date: 2015-12-31 02:53:15
Okay, so this ongoing record works pretty much like this. If I am paying you 1 BTC per minute, each minute I sign a transaction with incrementing BTC values. So that if it stops at 37 BTC after 37 minutes, you just relay the 37 BTC transaction to the blockchain, and all the 1-36 BTC transactions I signed and sent to you never gets shown to the blockchain?

1. So to put things in perspective, how many GH/s can a normal laptop achieve compared to this chip's 52 GH/s?
2. How much money would this chip make? Anyone here that can translate hashing power into bitcoins/month (ignore electricity costs)?
3. Can it be used to efficiently mine altcoins? Are there some altcoins more profitable to mine than bitcoin? Guessing this chip is only useful for SHA256-based coins though, is that the most common algorithm used by other cryptos aswell?

It's enough for them to break us with 51%, they'll just need to stop mining their own chain for a quick moment while they reorg us. It's completely sufficient to attack us at 66% cause then they can take 34% to break the 33% left at Core while keeping 32% to defend their own chain. The 75-25 number you have is too naive.

She's a yoga instructor who has studied human rights, she doesn't really have a lab or use bitcoin, blockchains, or know anything about economy or anything like that.

For instance, she's talking about how blockchains could disintermediate escrow services when it comes to paying for a physical product. That's impossible. Disintermediation of escrow is only possible using blockchain technology when there is cryptographic proof of that something happened, which doesn't exist for whether item A exists on place B. A signed bitcoin transaction in the blockchain moves a bitcoin, but a signed entry from a third party on your random hypothetical blockchain claiming that something happened in a real-world event doesn't mean it really happened. Blockchains can't prove anything about location of real world items. As such, there will still need to be a delivery agency who will need to provide input to a smart contract once the item is delivered (meaning, it needs to act as an oracle). So that delivery agency will then become the arbitrator of that smart contract between you and the vendor. Which pretty much adds no advantage whatsoever over existing systems.

@_date: 2016-05-15 20:08:52
I guess so. In permissionless systems like Bitcoin and Ethereum, you need to have oracles competing with eachother for trust. Trusted oracles get more jobs and generate more revenue. But since someone can copy the answers of another oracle since "bets" must be made public, it creates an uneven playing field for the participants, making permissionless oracles defunct when it comes to outside world information game theoretically speaking. That's just Paul Sztorcs interpretation though, and despite him being exceptionally smart and educated, I could still imagine a scenario where oracles would be acting honestly, atleast for settling bets truthfully that are trivial. A company like Coinbase could for example decide to run an oracle service and be incentivized to remain honest simply for branding and recognition purposes.

Theoretically though, if the killer had a blog and you could monitor it via the hosting company to see where he was accessing the blog from, you'd get a list of IP addresses. So maybe you wanna track where he's connecting from in real-time. Maybe everyone in the office wants that info. So someone draws up a GUI interface using visual basic that tracks the IP addresses the killer is using, perhaps for display on a screen in the office, so anyone on-the-clock can notice a new connection from the attacker instantly.
