Anything is possible.  The BTC vs BCH war came out of no where and caused BTC to drop about 20% in a few days.  Most of us will always be one step behind the whales or institutional investors with major price movements.  Just when you think something is going to happen, like a correction, the market does the opposite, and vice versa.

I'll take this any day. BTC dropped significantly during the last 2 BCH pumps, so seeing this makes me feel good during the current alt pumps. It tells me there's plenty of new money coming in to BTC.

You won't be able to. If you want to move it, do it before.

Ledger S Nano. You can use it to store BTC, LTC, ETH (and all ERC20 coins), a whole host of additional altcoins, including NEO which was added recently. I like Ledger, because it's less expensive than some of the other hard wallets and is just as good.
For other coins that aren't supported yet, you can usually find a native software wallet for them. Just make sure you copy all of the backup codes for any wallet you choose and cold store it.

When you sell your coins on Coinbase, just select your USD wallet rather than your bank account. That way, when you're ready to buy back in, you will get your coins immediately.

Are you using a credit card or ach?  If ach, I don’t think they can charge you any fees, since it’s just like writing a check.  If credit card, they may treat it as a cash advance, so you get charged daily interest from day 1.

The fork will most likely happen to some degree.  You can't stop miners, albeit a small and inconsequential number, from upgrading their software to start mining B2X, since the code is already out on Github.  Most likely, there won't be enough people mining this new coin, therefore it will take forever for transactions to be validated, rendering the forked blockchain useless.

That's why he's the CIO.  He should stick to technology.

Lol.  Sad but true.

Yes, you can do just that.  
For your cryptos, it's always better to store it in a wallet that you control (have access to the private keys).  But if you are to keep them in an exchange, Coinbase is probably the best, because all coins are fully insured, but that's only if Coinbase was to get hacked.  The risk would be if someone got access to your account because they hacked your phone or computer.  That would not be covered.
For your USD wallet on Coinbase, your funds are insured up to $250K if you are in the US.  Hope this helps.

Oh, if you just want to sell into cash, you can do it at any time, even during the blackout period. I thought you were moving it to another wallet for some reason.  That type of withdrawal will be restricted during the period.  When you buy and sell for fiat on Coinbase, they just make an internal transaction to credit or debit your account, like a bank.

People will take some profits and put them into some of the good alts that have been forgotten a bit.

Whether you are right or wrong, hodling BTC is still the right thing to do as if the fork does happen, you'll get the new coin as planned.

If the Seg2x fork happens as planned, you will have 1:1 ratio of the new coins to whatever BTCs you're holding at the time of the fork.  This is for sure if you own the private keys to your wallet on the BTC blockchain.  You're taking a risk if your coins are on an exchange, as they may not support the new coin now that the main players are out.  Worst case, you won't get any new coins, which at this point are trading at about 5% of BTC's price.

Good movie
