I see what you did there
@_date: 2018-01-14 09:46:24
No worries, people have expended quite some thoughts on the matter already.
@_date: 2018-01-27 08:21:39
This is actually good news for Bitcoin

There would have been Nakamoto consensus. Clearly, that wasn't the case here.

Oh the irony
@_date: 2018-01-14 11:08:05
I'm not saying it does or does not work. My point was that "to think about it for a bit" is not enough effort to form a valuable opinion on the matter.

It's not a fraud. It's an alternative vision on the future of Bitcoin. I happen to share that vision.
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:37:13
Not sure if you're downvoting me but I hope we can have a discussion without that sort of thing. I'm here to engage in conversation and learn, I hope that's OK.
Many other cryptocurrency communities regularly perform hard forks because they believe that hard forks are a cleaner way to upgrade than soft forks. They requires less workarounds and thus lead to cleaner code. Apparently you disagree. Can you explain your perspective?
@_date: 2017-12-05 11:09:32
I'm very sorry for your loss. I cannot imagine what it must be like to lose a brother like that. Thank you for sharing his story. It may prevent others from doing the same thing.
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:00:30
Wow, why the hostility? It's common courtesy to not just downvote someone just because you disagree with them. Go carry on this conversation without me.
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:14:56
Look, I know about all that and think it sucks. A transaction between two free people is meant to be private.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:13:11
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:30:53
No-one is arguing with that. I'm just saying that all transactions should be private by default. If we decide that government's transactions should be transparent, that's great. With respect to banks: they should probably cease to exist in their current form anyway.
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:54:11
Right, and the unwashed can just transact without privacy then?
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:43:39
Monero already implemented Ring CT without issues. Even if Bitcoin takes years, I'm wondering if there will be enough political support for a hard fork within the Bitcoin community to implement CT.

Publicly traded companies may want to protect their transactional privacy in the interest of their shareholders. It makes no sense to force them to publicize these.

I am sick of all the ad hominem attacks. This sub demonizes Ver as some monster who took your precious Bitcoin from you for his own personal interest. That is not the case at all.

Governments and banks may be able to track my purchases but now imagine a company offering this service to your boss or you neighbour across the street. Public is _public_.
Also I think none of these should have access to my transactions. So yes, it makes me uncomfortable.

Read again: _current_ scaling issues
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:10:57
I fear that many on-chain transactions will be necessary for opening and closing channels for just a few actual transactions. But I may be wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:12:59
The point is you can agree or disagree with the issue but it's wrong to discredit him simply for having this opinion. You can expect this opinion from a voluntarist. It's grounded in morality just as much as another opinion. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:15:43
We disagree so strongly on this point that it's probably pointless for me to argue with you on this one.
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:13:53
I could live with that. I'm afraid my confidence in such a solution is not very high though.
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:13:04
I'm dead serious. It's not obvious whether the on- or off-chain scaling vision will prevail.
@_date: 2017-12-04 08:11:22
If you disregard the technical debt
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:25:02

@_date: 2017-12-11 07:21:12
OK I'll have to look into that. When and how? Through a hard fork?
Edit: I'm asking because hard forks don't seem to get much love here
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:36:45
Consider this: fees and congestion are absolutely killing Bitpay's business model. They would seem to be highly incentivized to implement a solution quickly, no? Why do you think they haven't?
Edit: I will answer the question for you. They have started supporting BCH in September. They apparently have more faith in this solution than they have in SegWit. They don't have the same vision for the future of Bitcoin as the current Core developers.

Co here. You seem to believe that the ledger has already ossified. But monopolies lead to suboptimal results and competition is healthy. Are you really sure that the best way to do cryptocurrency can be decided by committee? I believe that the free market should decide. It's bound to leave a few casualties along the way, but that's the kind of Bitcoin I signed up for and I wouldn't want it any other way.
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:34:55
If the software handles this automatically, how many on-chain transactions will be needed to remain connected to the LN? Given that there are many hubs to preserve decentralization and hubs may go on-and off-line all the time?
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:59:12
Yes, this is how it used to happen. Are we now suddenly not able to be honest citizens anymore? Do we need to be spied on?
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:06:07
True. I suppose I see a difference between blanket surveillance and door to door tax collection. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:47:51
Which one would have to come first, you think?
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:41:16
You own shares in Company X. Because all its transactions are public, their competitors, whose shares are not publicly traded, can easily spy on all their innovations and plans and run circles around Company X. Company X goes bankrupt.
Edit: I think you're stuck in the paradigm "whoever hides something must have something nefarious to hide". Do you take a shit with the door open?

The operator of Bitmixer quit his business because he thought you would be better off using privacy oriented coins.
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:02:56
It's not about routing others' payments for me, no problem there. I'm concerned about people connecting intermittently with several LN hubs and using on-chain space to do so. I think there will still be a lot of on-chain space needed. But I could be wrong.

I don't agree with everything you say here but this is definitely a quality post. Let's hope it saves some people from overinvesting. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:14:44
Too little too late. It's still hardly an increase. By the time everyone uses Segwit, the blocks will have become too small again. Hell, even if all transactions were Segwit today, the blocks would be too small.
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:02:54
Thank God for Monero. Edit: don't want to shill here but that future sounded scary.
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:15:42
Other coins have already solved their current scaling issues. That's how you engineer: fix first what kills first. Don't overengineer for future problems while your coin is drowning in congestion and fees.

This concept is flawed. I remove my fiat money from my bank account to buy cryptocurrency. The fiat money is deposited in a bank account again. No difference.
Edit: unless the money goes overseas. In which case it would be prudent for Australian banks to start selling cryptocurrencies themselves (if the outflows are actually so dangerous - I'm not at all sure that they are).
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:06:56


I kind of like people to break from consensus every once in a while.
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:27:21
Yes, the money has now effectively left the Australian banking system. But the total supply of fiat in the world has not changed.
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:29:19
I could never answer that question to the level of detail that you would be interested in. It is my opinion that to upgrade the protocol through a series of soft forks is a surefire way to ossify the protocol and be overtaken by other more nimble projects.
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:03:57
I think CT will require a hard fork, not sure how easy that will be. I'm worried that LN requires large hubs that may stick out to authorities and may be subjected to KYC/AML. Also, I'm worried that the UX will deteriorate.
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:59:14
Check out bulletproofs. Scaling just improved by a factor of 5.
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:07:32
I know and I'm very happy with bulletproofs. I see where your worries are coming from. But the thing is: at least Monero is iterating. Bitcoin seems terribly afraid of hard forks. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:47:31
What he means is that this sub used to be filled with people who viewed the world differently from others. They would look at something like insider trading and actually wonder whether or not you could say that it was a crime if all involved knew that it could happen. And they would discuss that.
Many libertarians would not feel that way at all.
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:16:21

Thanks for the soft fork link, didn't know that! Good news for LTC and BTC. Would be amazing if CT/coinjoin became default.
I think the UX will deteriorate if users are required to lock up funds in several lightning nodes in order to transact. I also wonder what happens if a user goes offline for a while.

@_date: 2017-12-04 07:13:58
Bitcoin had so many people in favor of increasing the blocksize limit that there are now several competing dev teams working on this. No committees.
We have very different opinions. If a currency has a competitive advantage, it should rise to the top. If that doesn't happen, _my_ confidence in cryptocurrencies would be shaken.

"For example, let’s look at transaction that paid $0.01 in fees. Since it only cost the miner $0.0001 to add it, of course, he will mine that transaction. But that transaction is uneconomical for the whole network. When mined, it will hurt the network. In contrast, if there was a block size limit, miners can only mine transactions paying the most fees."
Can anyone explain this to me: can the miner indeed add this transaction after knowing for a fact that he won the block reward? If not, it would be uneconomical for him to add it, right? If this isn't the case, is there no way to make it uneconomical for the individual miner to mine this transaction?

No dude, you're missing the point. You may trust your current government, but you have no way of knowing whether you would trust the next one.

Newsflash for Santander: you cannot send fiat currency through the blockchain. All you can send are tokens. If you want to send tokens, you will either use Bitcoin or invent an altcoin. If you invent an altcoin, good luck bootstrapping it. If you don't want to invent an altcoin, just use a database. But don't call it a blockchain then.

The processes are similar indeed. But integrate the functionality into the wallet app and a user could 1. scan, 2. confirm, 3. done. Now a process that relied on browsers auto-completing your details and wallets integrating with browsers has been replaced by a simple new BIP. Ordering stuff suddenly becomes a protocol. Anyone can hook into this protocol with a very low barrier to entry. Other than that you are completely right.

They will continue to be pleased with their fiat holdings until the bitcoin price starts to climb relative to fiat currency. Ultimately, that is the selling point: a money supply that does not inflate beyond a hard limit. That's where adoption happens.

@_date: 2015-06-22 20:59:30
I concur. But I don't claim that. There will always be skewed distributions. This is not a function of inefficient markets, it's a function of any market. Look at coinmarketcap for an example. Cryptocurrency is a pretty free market, wouldn't you agree? Yet, almost all of the market is dominated by one currency: Bitcoin.

The point you seem to be missing is that real wages are already adjusted for inflation. So of they go up, buying power goes up. It really does not matter where the inflation line is going if the real wages line is already adjusted for it.
More relevant is that reported inflation is probably understated. See shadowstats.com

That's what I thought. So then why are you saying that a miner is incentivized to add transactions with a 0.01 fee if he knows that the cost of including it is 50 cents? 
I mean: the only way he profits from this is if he wins the reward. But he doesn't know this beforehand.

Even though I fully agree with that sentiment, I myself use only SPV wallets to interact with the network. Wouldn't this be the case for the vast majority of users?

No I am talking about integrating this stuff into a bitcoin wallet. So you scan a QR code (containing a BTC address, the price and the URL of a form) on your tanning lotion with your enhanced bitcoin wallet, you pay the money to the embedded bitcoin address (on-chain) and your wallet prompts you to confirm sending your shipping details through HTTPS to the form. Off-chain.

That sounds great for many of us but I would recommend my mom to buy a trezor.

Don't worry bro, Asimov's first law got your back.
@_date: 2015-06-13 07:14:06


True. It's digital cash. So that's OK. You get to guard your own cash. Buy a trezor as you would buy a safe for your cash. Or don't, but run the risk of losing it. As you would with cash.


There are ideological reasons to run nodes. Also, those with a sizeable position in BTC have an incentive to help to secure the network that gives their BTC value. Even if they are not rewarded directly.


Great, flood the network! The block size will be increased to manage the load and the fees you pay will help pay for upgrading the hardware. Throw mass at the black hole. That'll teach it.


Nah, they are not. 10 minutes is just fine. For most transactions zero conf is even perfectly OK. Prove me otherwise by double spending a significant amount of money somewhere.


Short term gains will never make up for the long term losses you suffer if all your expensive hashing power is used to discredit the network. There is an incentive to cooperate. You bought in, so you're going to behave.


Low amounts: download a good software wallet (easier than getting a bank account).
Higher amounts: use a trezor (easier than buying and installing a safe).


This is work in progress. BIP100 seems to gain traction. Sidechains will help to test drive new features. Sure, ossification is a problem, but problems can many times be solved.


Dude. It's cash. Guard your cash!


Nah, they suck.


No, sound money makes it worth it. Fiat money suffers from a fundamental flaw: it derives its value from a central authority. That power is huge and has a tendency to corrupt. Better to have an alternative that is censorship resistant, has no central authority, is inclusive and has a hard limit. If you don't like it, don't use it. You're free to do so. How about your fiat currency? You're forced to use it, it can be printed at will, and anyone can be excluded from getting a bank account.


I care.

Exactly! Why would most large businesses support Bitcoin if they don't know for sure whether it scales or not? Those who adopt Bitcoin take a large risk but the reward is currently unclear. Solving scalability is essential.

There are two ways to do fiat - btc - fiat. One involves the free market and needs bitcoin to have value. In which case it functions as money. And you are still simply sending bitcoin over the blockchain as we are doing for years already. The other way is for some colored satoshi to represent fiat money, in which case bitcoin would have no value, the blockchain would not be secure and you would be better off with a simple database. I would argue that people who go to a sub merely to call its community dumb are probably not too bright themselves. And probably underage.

You still don't seem to get that real wages are already adjusted for stated inflation. If you are looking at raw data for real wages, there is no need to look at inflation data. The data are incorporated in the real wages already. You seem to be confusing nominal wages with real wages. Nominal wages are what you see on your paycheck. Real wages are adjusted for stated inflation so they are the best measure of buying power (if you believe that reported inflation numbers are correct). See the difference?

I agree with your first point. The computational power of bitcoin is not what is meant by this author though, so I disagree on point 2.

So in that case we agree that the complexity of the network scales linearly with the number of users if we keep the number of nodes constant under the assumption that full independent security is a marginal use case.

Is scaling Bitcoin O n-squared, yes or no? Thoughts anyone? This seems to be a fundamental question that needs to be addressed beyond a doubt before a decision is made. If it is, then Bitcoin fundamentally does not scale. If it's not, then by all means, slowly increase the block size.

I think the market is smaller then that for web wallets or hardware wallets. It's a real niche. Who do you know who hosts their own website? Why would people want to host their own online wallet? If it's the added security they want over web wallets, they might choose a hardware wallet or cold storage. If it's the added convenience they want, they could go with a regular web wallet. Where is your market? Somewhere in between? Or does it combine the worst of both worlds? It's hard to do and it's still an online security risk!

With this solution you are targeting the following market: people who are smart enough that they a) like bitcoin b) want to store their bitcoin in a wallet that is solely under their own control c) feel comfortable fidgeting with their own online server security d) favor your solution over a hardware wallet. 
I would say the market for that is pretty thin. And it opens you up to all sorts of legal risk since you sort of share the responsibility for security with the users. Where does their liability end and does yours begin when coins are lost?

I used to be (and still am in some respect) a gold bug. I used to think Bitcoin was bad because it is not intrinsically valuable. The epiphany for me came when I realized that gold itself is nothing more than a ledger. It may not be a centralized ledger, but it sure functions as a decentralized ledger. Gold's intrinsic value derives from that function. I used to think it was the other way around: that people started using it as money because it was intrinsically valuable as a beautiful metal. But the fact is: we only think it is a beautiful metal because it represents wealth! And it represents wealth because we use it as money!
@_date: 2015-05-21 14:25:36
The thing is: gold is hardly useful in itself. It hardly derives its value from its intrinsic usefulness as a commodity (like pork bellies or coffee) but instead from its ability to keep score. Gold represents wealth. Sure, you can make a ring from gold. But we really only value gold rings because they represent wealth, not because gold is the best material to make rings of.
Gold is a universal ledger. Casino chips are not. But in my opinion, both are physical ledgers.
@_date: 2015-05-21 09:26:28
Gold is a great tangible ledger. In times where there weren't any means of transporting value over distances, gold ruled the world because there was no real alternative. Gold measured claims to products and services in the economy.
Paper money replaced it because it was easier to transport and more divisible. Transportabilty and divisbility apparently were extremely important to people, so much even that they trusted the paper to be just as valuable as gold.
However, then fiat currency came into existence, because paper money was too easy to produce; producing more paper promises than there was gold was simply too tempting.
But at the same time transportabilty was improved further by bank accounts and electronic payment systems. So people were still happy to use this fiat money. They even got rid of most of the cash they had.
Now we have an alternative that is hard to produce and easily transportable across a World Wide Ledger: Bitcoin. It keeps track of claims to products and services in the economy without any worry of broken paper promises. Why do we need to back it with gold again?
Gold is a great tangible ledger. But why do we need to back the World Wide Ledger with a ledger?

Nothing stops the Greek government from reneging on their promise to back the currency with this asset basket.

@_date: 2015-05-18 05:43:12
Not sure if this is practical. But let's say you would want to do it on-chain. In that case the keyboard app would have to create an address, send the selected amount of bitcoin to it and then paste its private key into the conversation somehow. However, now it becomes necessary for the other party to have software in place that can sweep the private key. This is too large a barrier IMHO.
Alternatively it would use a Coinkite voucher. This is a URL carrying bitcoin that can be redeemed to any address. This is the closest-to-on-chain practical solution that I can think of. It's the same solution that can be used to send btc by SMS:

Human beings stereotype. It’s part of our wiring. There’s no getting around it.
In China you will be dealing with your own stereotypes of Chinese people. You could either pretend they’re not there and have them sink your business, or you can acknowledge them and re-frame them into more positive ways of thinking. It’s up to you.
Here are 9 common stereotypes you’re likely to have in whole or in part, and ways to re-frame them:
1. The Chinese are out to cheat me.
China has been through a lot of tough history, over thousands of years and even up to very recent times. Chinese people have had to make tough choices in a world of scarcity. This mentality has been passed down through the generations. No Chinese does anything a Westerner wouldn’t do if fighting for survival.
The upshot: Cross your T’s and dot your I’s. Be prudent, not paranoid.
2. The Chinese think they’re superior.
The Chinese are legitimately proud of their amazing cultural accomplishments. Think of the food, the monuments, the language, and on and on. Chinese give respect where it’s due: to Westerners for their advanced technology and social institutions, and to themselves for what they’ve done.
The upshot: Allow yourself to admire what there is to admire, while keeping your cool.
3. The Chinese lie. 
People from every culture lie. What Westerners call “lying” in China is often just a more subtle form of communication than we’re used to. China is what’s known as a “high context” culture: information is assumed to be in the background — the context. The more you learn about the assumed context, the better you’ll get at seeing the meaning behind the words.
The upshot: Get trained on Chinese communication style. Learn as much as you can about the Chinese mindset, so that you know what background assumptions people bring to the conversation.
4. The Chinese go back on their word.
Shaped for millennia by a fickle, resource-poor environment rife with natural disasters, the Chinese see the world as constantly in flux. Circumstances change, and it’s foolish to set a plan in stone now for an imagined future, when it might not be a fit for the actual future. It’s best to remain adaptable and flexible.
The upshot: Be ready for your counterparts to ask for changes to contracts. Understand that in China the contract is often seen as the beginning of a relationship, not a fixed definition of reality.
5. The Chinese are always stalling for time. 
Like any business counterpart anywhere in the world, the Chinese have strategies for getting what they want. A common one is to use home court to their advantage. It’s easier on the Chinese if things take longer than it is on you.
Upshot: Be ready and set reasonable expectations that things probably aren’t going to happen quickly.
6. The Chinese are stingy. 
The Chinese are thrifty. Again, over millennia the Chinese have often had to scrape together meager livings out of a hostile, overcrowded environment. Every resource is precious, and could disappear at a moment’s notice if not carefully guarded.
The upshot: Negotiation is not viewed as a win–win proposition. Be thrifty with your resources too, and meet the Chinese on their own zero-sum terms.
7. The Chinese don’t care about quality. 
Everyone cares about quality. But when it comes to priorities, sometimes it’s more important to the Chinese to save some resources than to make something that fits Westerners’ high standards. See above about precious resources.

8. The Chinese don’t care about their environment. 
The world of the average Chinese person is relatively small. People are focused — narrowly, from a prosperous Western perspective — on day-to-day concerns like having enough to eat and a roof over their heads. It might be nice to have a cleaner environment, but for many Chinese that’s a luxury.
The upshot: Instead of complaining about the awful air, imagine what it would be like if you didn’t get to leave it in a week or two.
9. The Chinese hate Westerners.
In fact Westerners are much admired in China. What Westerners perceive as “hatred” is usually more a vague sense of suspicion. Like everything else, this results from the thought habits of the past, especially the past century and a half, which saw Westerners exploit and mistreat China. All this means is that you have to earn their trust.
The upshot: Behave in a way that is worthy of trust, and trust will come. With time.

Let's say you are using whatsapp and want to send the other person money through changetip. Currently you would have to set up a one-time tip link in a separate window and copy- paste the url into whatsapp. What if you could simply switch keyboards, select an amount from the Changetip Keyboard and have the tip link appear automatically in your whatsapp conversation? See Sunrise Meet for an example of how this would work. 
Edit: To me it seems this would allow for easy bitcoin transfer through any mobile messaging app that uses a keyboard (all of them).
Edit2: I used changetip as an example but this could be integrated with any web wallet that supports sending Bitcoin through a URL (coinbase, blockchain.info, coinkite vouchers etc)
Edit3: note that the "keyboard" does not have to resemble a full keyboard at all. It could simply show your balance, have a numerical keypad and a send button. It merely behaves as a keyboard to output the tip link URL into the messenger app. So switch keyboards, select 500 bits, press send and get automatically switched back to your regular keyboard. Output: tip link URL carrying 500 bits.
@_date: 2015-05-17 10:35:55
No I don't think so. I am talking about sending btc from within any messaging app. What you are talking about is sending btc from a wallet through any sharing app. Although cool, this is not the same. Using the keyboard solution I propose would mean you wouldn't need to leave your whatsapp conversation to send btc. You simply switch keyboards temporarily. Using your share solution you would have to move away from whatsapp, open a wallet, select an amount, share with whatsapp and then go back to whatsapp to continue your conversation. Different UX

Cooperation drives progress. Like cells cooperate through communication and sharing value, so do humans. If we find better ways to communicate (the internet) we become more productive. If we find better ways to share value, we become more productive. To me it's analogous to evolution. If you don't like the analogy, that's fine by me.

It has some characteristics of a pyramid scheme as well:
Wikipedia: "In a pyramid scheme, an organization compels individuals to make a payment and join. In exchange, the organization promises its new members a share of the money taken from every additional member that they recruit. The directors of the organization (those at the top of the pyramid) also receive a share of these payments. For the directors, the scheme is potentially lucrative—whether or not they do any work, the organization's membership has a strong incentive to continue recruiting and funneling money to the top of the pyramid."
I agree to some level with Pegasus that the incentive structure of Bitcoin resembles this but that this is a necessity to be able to bootstrap the currency. Early adopters get rich. It's the price society must pay to get a sound money. The reward is infinitely more valuable than the cost.
@_date: 2015-01-07 22:32:34
Sure but electricity costs were still pretty manageable compared to today. I would argue that the risk/reward ratio in those days was substantially more favorable compared to today. Today we never encourage newbies to mine, do we? We could easily have done so in 2010.

At some point transaction fees will become practically the only incentive to mine bitcoin. A lot of hashing power could become idle/unprofitable in this situation. It may then be more profitable to attack the blockchain (double-spend) by bringing hashing power online in short bouts than to consistently mine for bitcoin. I can see that given a high enough transaction volume, the incentive of miners to protect the reputation of the blockchain stays intact because of the transaction fees. But what if adoption does not scale fast enough? Will this incentive hold? Any thoughts?

I agree that the disruptive effect will probably be more important than the opportunity for theft. However, there may be other parties interested in disrupting Bitcoin. For instance, disrupting Bitcoin can benefit those who short bitcoin, or those who are in competition with Bitcoin (banks, financial services, governments). A large pool of benevolent hashing power constitutes a strong protection against these forces. I am worried that that power may dwindle.

Front-running could happen something like this:
* 1. market maker has a 230/232 bid/ask spread on 1 BTC 
* 2. trader bids 232 for 1 BTC
* 3. market maker gets the order first and decides to move his price against the trader - he increases his bid/ask to 231/233 before the trader's order hits the exchange
The issue here is that the trader expected an immediate fill: he expected liquidity for his 232 bid.
The liquidity is a mirage when market makers can withdraw it before anyone can make use of it.

Wouldn't this be true even without sidechains? At some point transaction fees are practically the only incentive to mine Bitcoin.

Or maybe you mean to say that this will only happen if the owner of the hashing power had something to gain by discrediting Bitcoin.

In times of volatility, there is more trading. More Bitcoiners have HD wallets nowadays. So the same volatility today will result in more active addresses the last 24h than it would have some time ago, even if the number of Bitcoiners is the same.

He makes the point that long-term inflation could be bad for those on fixed nominal payments, but dismisses it by saying that these payments can be adjusted for inflation. However, holders of assets profit from the difference between monetary inflation and price inflation. Because of economic progress, price inflation is tempered. Those on fixed nominal payments therefore do not profit from progress in the same way as those holding assets and the gap between rich and poor increases as a result.

Could you explain why it will be more beneficial to cooperate?

I don't think this is correct. You would only select the keyboard if you wanted to send btc. Otherwise you still use your normal keyboard. I have Swype and the regular Android keyboard and can switch between them at any time. Only the keyboard that is currently selected listens to the input. For highest simplicity the input for the changetip keyboard could only be numerical, not supporting monikers but only bits. So switch keyboards, select 500 bits, press send and get automatically switched back to your regular keyboard. Output: tip link carrying 500 bits.
Edit: I checked but it appears I was wrong. Although I used to be able to switch keyboards on the fly, apparently now this is only possible from the settings menu. That sucks. ~~In that case you are right and you would have to trust your keyboard provider because now the only way to implement this frictionlessly is to always use a changetip enabled keyboard. In which case you give a wallet potential access to all your keystrokes.~~ There seems to be a workaround for this.
Edit 2: apparently Lollipop changed the keyboard policy. Some phones still support a keyboard switch softkey though: 
This is how Sunrise Meet solved the issue (through a notification): 
So switching keyboards on the fly remains a possibility.

Gold is a ledger in the sense that it is a representation of wealth. Not in the sense of a written record. Like casino chips are a representation of wealth. In itself casino chips are worthless. They are an easy way to keep score. This is how I view gold: a way to keep score. All the beauty we ascribe to gold is influenced by our perception of its value.

I disagree. Borrowing money in a currency that can be printed and for which the markets believe that the printers will backstop any defaults does not enforce market discipline. Lenders got caught with their pants down when suddenly it appeared that the ECB and IMF do not endlessly support Greece with funny money infusions. That's why Greece is in a pinch now.

It seems to me the difficulty is not so much to get people to mine a new coin, or to come up with an ASIC resistant algo, the difficulty is in getting an initial fair distribution of the coins. Any altcoin will be suspected of a lopsided (pre-mining) distribution and therefore it will not be viewed as a fair coin. It would therefore not be able to bootstrap to a significant network effect. Nobody trusts it.
Using the current Bitcoin blockchain history you would simply accept the current economic reality (use Bitcoin's coin distribution) and spin up a fair new coin. Any early Bitcoin adopters would automatically have a stake in the new coin. Immediate network effect.

Value is _always_ the result of context. Gold is considered valuable because it has always been used as money. The moneyness rubbed off on its value. It's not the other way around.

No. Deflation is only bad when it's the result of a credit crunch. Think the Great Depression. Deflation that is the result of increased productivity is fine. Think cellphone pricing.

@_date: 2017-08-15 16:34:06
Thanks, I guess? I simplified it a bit for brevity but I stand by my conclusions. To my knowledge, none of the cryptocurrencies is explicitly deflationary. Bitcoin has a disinflationary emission curve, approaching 0.
Under a disinflationary currency where emission ultimately reaches 0, house prices might still fluctuate on the basis of supply and demand but on average house prices would be stable. This would remove the incentive for speculation and allow prices to find an equilibrium that is actually based on utility. If you wonder what would happen to people trying to take out a mortgage: they would probably pay significantly less for their house with speculation removed from the price. The interest rate could either be higher because of higher risks for the lender in a full reserve system, or they could be lower because interest rates do not have to make up for inflation anymore.
All in all, mortgage lending will probably decrease substantially because saving will be much more worthwhile. Currently, saving is penalized and borrowing is promoted. This illogical situation will end.
In the US it is considered normal to borrow to buy a car. This is not considered normal in all countries. A similar thing could happen for housing. In fact, mortgages weren't all that prevalent in the past either. It used to be frowned upon to have a mortgage on your house.
You claim that currency needs to depreciate for it to function and that people are able to escape this penalty by investing their money elsewhere. I would argue that this situation promotes inequality. Those who earn wages or pensions see their purchasing power erode. Only those with capital are able to escape this penalty. And even then: those in the know about investments benefit at the expense of the rest. Also, the penalty ends up in the coffers of banks. This is no way to run a fair financial system. Also, gold was used for thousands of years which shows that depreciation is not necessary either.
Edit: the conventional wisdom that inflation is beneficial has been actively promoted by those who benefit from it.   This in itself is not an argument against inflation, but it should urge anyone to at least perform their own independent thinking to reach an independent conclusion.
Edit 2: also, the type of deflation you mention (where people lose their jobs and it spirals out of control) is caused by a credit crunch. Such a credit crunch is much less likely to happen in a full reserve system because money is not destroyed when credit tightens. Dropping prices in absence of a credit crunch are fine: they are a natural occurrence in an economy where productivity continuously increases.

This is completely backward. Bitcoin derives value from its utility. Your analogy sucks. Digging gold out of the ground would have been useless if gold didn't have the potential to circulate. The reason gold isn't much more expensive now is that fiat money circulates with less friction. Increasing the friction for bitcoin to circulate will definitely not increase its value.

No I am not. I am claiming that money is a language that expresses value. You claim that a cow represents value too. I agree but think it is on a lower level of abstraction. Next, you say we don't need money to send each other tokens that represent goods. I agree but I still believe we should be using a higher level of abstraction and have the value of the cow be represented by money instead of a cow token. I challenge you to send me a "cow" to show you the difficulty in exchanging value through a modern communication medium without using money as a language. No goal posts moved.

@_date: 2015-08-15 17:26:25
Me too. By the way, if I understood the article correctly, Williams makes no attempt to include stuff that is not measured by CPI. So if CPI cherry picks, he makes no attempt to adjust for that. He merely corrects CPI for a difference in methodology compared to earlier CPI measurements. And he then makes a mathematical error to arrive at an inflated correction factor.
@_date: 2015-08-15 09:39:34
I used to think that as well. But yesterday I read: 
@_date: 2015-08-27 14:13:14
I hope you're right but I wonder about the other "knobs" you speak of. What type of stimulus do you envision?
Is it illogical to assume a collapse upon rising rates? It seems to me that the debt has simply grown too big. Currently many countries and other market participants are borrowing money to pay interest on the loans they already took out. This is an unsustainable situation. Raising rates would quickly pull out the rug from underneath these entities.

Now take a step back and decide: do you want an economy to be centrally planned by having a committee decide the price of the most important good of all (money)? Or do you want free markets where the price of money is set by supply and demand?

The reason is this. To use bitcoin as a currency, two parties are needed: one to spend it and one to accept it. Acceptance is not ubiquitous. Where I can, I spend it. But in most cases, I cannot spend it.
To use bitcoin as an asset, there is only one party necessary: the HODLer.

The thing is, I realized that people first think that my shirt is rude to them. It appears the guy on the shirt is giving them the finger. Then they see the text and understand that the shirt is giving banks the finger, not them. They appreciate that: everybody dislikes banks. Walking through a crowded street, people actually turn their heads to read the shirt. Some people laugh and repeat the text to others they are with. Fascinating stuff.
Could be either good or bad but it sure had an emotional impact. And it explains the benefit of Bitcoin very clearly and on an emotional level.

Great stuff! But what about reflexivity? The decision to bump the block size limit could have consequences that no one can predict and they may run counter to even the best of informed opinions. 
Edit: for example, a decision either way may ultimately draw in a group of Bitcoin users that currently is not interested in Bitcoin at all and would never participate in the PM. I am no expert, but I think this may be a different setting then say a presidential election.
When Soros shorted the pound, he set in motion events that may not have materialized on their own.

Let me start by saying that I like e-mail, I really do. Even sent some myself back in the day. I think it's a cool technology with a lot of neat applications, especially as a way to send text messages to other nerds in academia.
But you've got to understand - when you guys start talking about e-mail replacing fax machines, you come across like absolute lunatics. You're talking about an extremely niche technology with a ridiculously low adoption rate, and which currently suffers from a variety of technological limitations that would prevent it from effectively functioning as a way to send mail within a single country, much less the entire world.
So let me just ask you guys: how do you see this going down? Logistically, what do you see happening in the next 10-15 years that could realistically result in e-mail becoming the world's way to communicate?

So, according to the paradox, intolerance of the intolerant is not only defensible but obligatory. The problem then is in how to define the intolerant. If one side could without error identify the other side as intolerant, then they shouldn't stop calling them intolerant. The point is, this errorless identification of intolerance does not occur.
So in my humble opinion, urging everyone to stop slinging mud at each other and then backhandedly accusing "the other" of being intolerant does not do anyone any good.

I think the issue here is that people have difficulty discerning risk from volatility. They are not the "same ting". USD is risky but not volatile. Bitcoin is volatile and its risk is up for discussion as far as I'm concerned.
Volatility is necessarily a backward looking measure. Risk happens in the future. Anyone who claims to know all the risks involved in Bitcoin is clearly wrong. You can make a case that Bitcoin is less risky than USD. The finite supply is an important argument. But I wouldn't bet the farm.

I can't say I like the price action but I still believe both coins have the same right to the name Bitcoin. Both chains share a common ancestor and both have different visions for its future, that have been discussed without a solution for years. Letting the market decide is the best way to go. And no, two months is not long enough for that decision to occur.
Edit: Bitcoin Cash is not the enemy here. Both chains want the same thing. They are just choosing different paths.

Now you are handwaving a bit. He explained a substantial risk. Bitcoin derives its value from a network effect. Governments can step on that by outlawing its use. This is different from ivory or drugs. These derive their value from utility and scarcity, the first of which is unchanged with them being outlawed (ivory and drugs are just as useful), the second of which goes up in that event (they are now harder to procure). 
Bitcoin will be no scarcer after governments outlaw it, just less useful.

OK I rephrase my original statement. BCH exists to test the hypothesis that scaling can happen on-chain. Whether it _currently_ tests that is another matter indeed.

Is there no need for the space on the chain?
@_date: 2017-10-12 19:40:20
You seem confused. You say that there is no need for space on the chain. Perhaps you weren't around to witness the bitter debate about just this issue the last couple of years. 3 tps is not enough to scale on-chain (nor is it enough to scale off-chain, but that's another discussion). Many use cases are impossible without a credible plan for scaling into the future. It has not been established what the best way to scale is. Both chains exist to test different hypotheses. That BCH currently has a lower transaction volume is irrelevant. Scaling is something that happens in the future.

With universal I mean acceptable to the people we would like to buy from. Those are mostly stores. Not our crypto-enlightened friends.
Torrents have a network effect in distribution but not in acceptance. I hope you understand the difference. You need no one to accept your torrent from you in order for you to enjoy its content. Bitcoin is only useful if you can use it for transactions with another. Thus it depends on acceptance.
Perhaps it is good to remark that I see great value in cryptocurrency. Mainstream acceptance is an obstacle that needs to be overcome. If governments prohibit or over-regulate they may negatively influence this process. Ignoring that does not help in my opinion. Just my two cents. Love Bitcoin.

Sounds great, but money is still created as debt that way. The problem with debt is that it relies on trust. If you accept someone's IOU, you trust that person to pay you back. But in fact, they may not be able to. If IOU's circulate across a trust network, this problem is not solved. Bitcoin is trustless. A bitcoin is no one's liability. If a person's credit evaporates, their bitcoin is still good.

Exactly: Bitcoin is sound money that cannot be debased. That is its best property.
@_date: 2015-04-17 17:59:50
An attribute of money is that it is universally accepted in trade. It's usefulness derives from this property. If Bitcoin is only accepted by a few people, it may not die immediately. But without a critical mass of accepting stores, Bitcoin will not go mainstream. Torrenting illegal content is different. You can enjoy that without the help of others. No network effect is needed. Torrents operate in a framework of abundance, not scarcity. Value is added with each copy. You are the end user of a torrent. Nobody is the end user of Bitcoin.

I would say the most important reason to order a Trezor is fear of losing your BTC. The Trezor itself is created with highly "paranoid" standards in mind, to minimize attack vectors as much as possible. I am just saying that ordering a Trezor to be delivered to your home address opens you up to another attack vector that has not been spoken about before. You link your address to a non-insubstantial amount of BTC.

I first heard about Bitcoin reading on Zerohedge. They were sure it was a ponzi scheme and so was I. But already being a gold bug, there was fertile ground in my mind for an alternative to central banks. As soon as I decided to actually read up on Bitcoin it hit me like a ton of bricks. This. Was. It. Never looked back.

It is a problem. You pulled the 10 percent out of a hat. It is either true or it is not. The only thing that could rationally solve this is a proof of burn. Unless the keys are indeed lost, in which case this risk will always haunt the market because nobody could ever know for sure. Kind of a paradox really.

I would argue that progress leads to falling input prices across the board, thus leading to falling total price levels given an environment without monetary inflation. Deflation would then be the natural consequence of progress. But always good to find someone who disagrees. Could you explain your position / my mistake better to me?

The average block size has roughly doubled from Jan 2015 to Jan 2014. It doubled again from Jan 2014 to Jan 2015. It now stands at about 0.38 Mb.
If this exponential growth continues, the limit of 1 Mb will be reached in a little over 1 year. However, since Bitcoin grows in violent upswings and violent crashes (not just price volatility but also adoption volatility), it may very well be sooner. Apart from that, average block size does not capture the edge cases very well. It means that many blocks will be larger and many blocks will be smaller. Therefore, congestions will already happen before the average block size reaches 1 Mb. During peak hours, transactions will take more time to clear even before the average block size is 1 Mb. 
We don't have two years to fix the issue IMHO.

Off-chain is not a real substitute for on-chain. It will lead to fractional reserve banking. If the blockchain does not support on-chain transactions in sufficient volume, there is no plausible threat of bank runs to keep the banks honest.

It is now. But in its current configuration it will stop doing so as soon as people flock to it in great numbers. It will break as soon as it is really needed. That's why it should be fit to handle on-chain transactions in large numbers. Not for every day life but for moments of panic.

My number one reason for owning BTC: its supply is limited. Sound money. Would the average Joe Sixpack be interested in that? He probably will be, in the long run. Everything else being equal, the price of BTC can only increase in relation to inflating fiat money supplies. This will attract users.

Gold failed because it stopped circulating. People do not pay each other in gold anymore because fiat is so much easier. If gold was still a serious alternative to fiat, we would now all be using gold as an alternative currency. We are not (even gold bugs are not), because gold is currently a relatively very bad medium of exchange. Bitcoin solves this problem. However, it needs to scale in order to solve it for more people than its current userbase. It cannot take on the trillion dollar gold market in its current form. It offers no benefit over gold if it circulates just as badly.

The problem with fractional reserve banking is that it also reduces the purchasing power of those who do not keep their bitcoin in a centralized institution. Banks extending more loans than they have in reserves add to the money supply and reduce the purchasing power of each unit of currency in circulation. The reason that gold kept the financial system in check was that people could always opt to distrust paper money and turn to gold, taking down insolvent banks in the process. If the blockchain is unable to perform that function because people cannot realistically pay each other on-chain because of a severe transaction limit, Bitcoin is unfit to protect people from fractional reserve banking and inflation of the money supply. It would essentially prevent the bank runs that are necessary to keep the system honest.

This article identifies the number one use case of Bitcoin: it can be used as an inflation hedge. Bitcoin offers a way to save in a currency that is set to appreciate in value because its emission is limited. Programmable money is cool and all, but the inflation hedge feature solves an actual real-life problem faced by billions of people.
