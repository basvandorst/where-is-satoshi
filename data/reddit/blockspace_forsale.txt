You are an astroturfing shill and you posted this same lie in 5 different crypto related subs.
And he just withdrew it, proving that it was his evidence all along.
@_date: 2019-04-19 00:47:42
Apparently couldn't verify the date that is in the header of the email that he just withdrew, nor could he confirm the date in his own forged PGP signature.
There are literally two time stamps in plain sight of the evidence submitted.

No worries friend. It's a confusing space. Hope you are able to verify your own research and continue to learn, as we all are and should be doing. Best of luck to you!

You absolutely do or they can RBF it. I can RBF and up the tx fee by 50 cents and save 50 cents. It doesn't matter how unlikely you think it is. I can do this from my phone wallet right now and you can't stop it unless you wait for 1 conf. You're clearly missing the point, but best of luck to you.

This was a huge failure. To the point where all txs propagated, the network was fine, and the attacker lost $2,500 in funds.
Huge failure.

Well first they have to open an LN channel and pay an onchain fee, then you have to determine if any channels you have open route to them, and if they don't you have to open another channel and pay an onchain fee.
So you're looking at a couple $3 txs to get set up. If your profit margin on Lemonade is $.25 you have to sell 12 cups of lemonade just to break even, excluding the onchain tx of the sender.
So practically nothing if you:
1. Expected to use LN today and already have an open channel
2. They have an LN channel as well
3. You have a sufficiently liquid route to make it to them
Just be honest please. This wasn't an LN question, it was a straight forward honest question. Try giving an honest answer instead of misleading newbies.
@_date: 2019-05-24 19:01:32
At current rates, 2-3 bucks. More like $3 if you/they don't want to wait 30 mins - 1hr for your tx to start confirming.

You mean that one interview where John Carvalho acted like a juvenile, totally undermining his credibility? We watched the same one right? The one where John lied over and over again, and then when Roger pointed out he lied he just started screaming "bcash" like a toddler? 
That was supposed to be an adult debate between two people. Unfortunately, John is a petulant child.

No it does not, but your next question is important for context


It actually does. The history of BTC and BCH is identical up until block  After that, they are completely different and non-transferable between the chains. The nature of a fork also means if you held 1 BTC on 8/1/2017 before the fork, you had 1 BCH as well. Same goes for the latter fork of BSV vs BCH. If you held 1 BCH on the fork date, you have 1 of each coin on each chain.
Think of the fork as the utensil itself. In this case, a two pronged fork. They share the same handle and stem, but when you reach the business end they separate completely and no longer touch each other in any way.
@_date: 2019-05-16 19:07:13
lol and now you are just lying. Not a surprise. You have any proof to backup your claim? Synced node counts look fine.
I'm all for calling out failures when they occur. They definitely had some bugs in their code. None of it has been catastrophic, and the individual that tried to exploit it lost over 2k. Try and fabricate something a little more substantial.
@_date: 2019-05-21 15:17:21
I think you have a poor understanding of how forks work. Both BCH and BSV share the same genesis block as BTC. By your definition, they're all the BTC blockchain which is plainly not true.

Intersting claim.
Here is the graph:
Here is SegWit adoption:
So in Dec 2017 we were at 8-11% SegWit adoption.
In Feb 2018 that spiked up dramatically and now we consistently see 30-40% SegWit adoption.
Safe to say, if we still had Dec 2017 tx levels this would definitely help, but the fee market would be on the rise again. I would expect (next-block) fees above $3 but below $12 roughly for the same level of txs at 40% SegWit adoption. Still better than $20+ we previously saw.
SegWit definitely works. Dec 2017 was crazy and if that level of transaction volume hits again, the average next-block tx fee will be high but definitely not as high as previously.
The more concerning thing at the moment is the SegWit adoption trend on the above site is slightly leaning downwards. Could mean nothing, but the path to 100% is fuzzy to me. How do you get 100% adoption of SegWit? I don't see how that could ever happen. I suppose 90%+ SegWit would be as huge though, and the last 10% adopting SegWit would be mostly a non-issue.
Also worth nothing there was a spike to \~50% segwit adoption for about 1 month (March 2019), but that fell off again suddenly, and now we are seeing more oscillations between the high and low point of SegWit txs per block (For example, 3/23/19 had \~50% SegWit txs, 3/30/19 had \~30%). Honestly hard to take anything definitive away from the charts as they can be confusing. The oscillations getting larger is puzzling though.

I can RBF it back to myself and save whatever the lemonade cost is. It's doesn't even take a small amount of technical knowledge, you can do it through most wallet GUIs.

Communists aren't famous for targeting protected minority groups with hate, violence and racism. In fact, they're more commonly known as the group that bands the working man together regardless of their race, religion, or color of their skin, in face of a common problem/cause.
Now, they tend to target the rich and affluent, kind of like some pseudo Robinhood morality complex, but being rich and affluent isn't a protected group.
Check this out on leftism and racism, and how it contrasts with itself:


So it makes sense why far left folks are so intolerant to intolerance. It is viewed as a mechanism to further divide the working class. Hard to argue against that, especially in modern context. Racism has been a great tool to get far right leaning folks in the US to actively believe that brown people are their number one problem the country is facing.

That's.... not really how it works. The number of unconfirmed txs is what drives the fee market. More unconfirmed tends to lead to an increase in next-block fees. There is a positive correlation there. The confirmed tx throughput has a hard ceiling at current rates. With 100% Segwit adoption the highest that ceiling can go (theoretically) is 604,800. Realistically what we see is around 470,000 (higher and lower) today which is higher than it's ever been, obviously. That number goes down if a tx is more complex (more inputs/outputs) as well.


In my comment I agreed with you and dived deeper in to the claim to back you up. It has helped. It works. All I dove in to was the "how much" and can the "fee issues happen" again? It's helped a lot, but the high fee problem can easily happen again. 
High fees are always going to be a problem, especially above $20k price point unless sub 1sat/vbyte txs start becoming accepted. If 1sat/vbyte is the lowest we can go, a simple 2 input 2 output transaction using SegWit still costs $4.25 @ $20,000 per BTC. Source: 
Obviously I am talking about next-block fees, and the calculator above is basically aiming for 2+ confs in 6 hours.
Compared to the $25 median fee in Dec 2017, this is monumentally better.

I buy all my ASICs in Bitcoin. I bought my NordVPN subscription in Bitcoin. I bought my Microsoft 365 2yr subscription in Bitcoin. All in the last 4 months (except for the Microsoft sub).
Bitcoin is peer-to-peer electronic cash. Stop bemoaning people that are using it like that. You can feel free to hold until the end of time if you wish, but folks driving utility through use are doing a service to the system that you never will.

So I'm gonna stand at that lemonade stand for 1/2 the day until it confirms? Otherwise it can be RBF back to myself, essentially letting me steal their lemonade.

Definitely could be a bug, but all the user comments below suggest all they had to do was revalidate the block and it synced. Also, my node is synced and I am running ABC. Never had to revalidate anything and still fully synced. Quote from your source:


So your claim:


Is utterly false.
Regarding the dust sweeping transactions, that could be fabricated for sure. However, if it is, it's hard to explain where all this is going:
So while you said:


What's so hard about just linking your source and then letting people verify? Your added narrative to your link is a complete lie.

Basically, yes. Up until 478559 the tx history is identical. You can still look up old BTC transactions prior to block 478559 on the BCH chain.
@_date: 2019-05-21 15:01:44
BCH and BSV both share the same genesis block and history up to their respective forks. Is that what you meant?
@_date: 2019-05-24 18:48:36
You'll burn for this heresy. But yes, literally almost any other crypto would be faster/cheaper than on-chain BTC right now.

Everyone listed a lot of good things that definitely need to be improved. If you improved everything that everyone listed in the comments here, to their specs, you still wouldn't see mass adoption.
UX is the pinnacle of all of this. You can have the most brilliantly engineered system in the world. If your UX blows, nobody will use your product. Simple as that.
