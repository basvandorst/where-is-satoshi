Just as easy as entering CC info but without having to give up my CC info.  Copied and pasted the address into Coinbase, hit send and within seconds it completed. Got an invoice and shipped out yesterday. 
Bought  some more coins instantly with Coinbase so my wallet looks the same. The discount was nice, but proving to these companies that Bitcoin works felt better.

Its funny because I used Zip Zap to buy my first Bitcoins back in early 2013. It was through the now absent BitInstant. 
I would tell BitInstant that I want  $50 in coins, they would send me a receipt through Zip Zap to deposit money at say a Money Gram location. I would then give the clerk the $53 or whatever with the fee attached and within 5 min my Bitcoin would be deposited in the designated address. 
It was so easy, not like now with the exchanges and verification process. Its funny looking back because I was annoyed at getting a slightly higher rate, and lower exchange value thqn Mt Gox. Instead of the $23 Mt Gox had, it would be like $21 with Zip Zap. I would kill to have $23 again.....Oh well, this is great news and finally a much more satisfying way to exchange cash for coins!!!

Same issue here.
Got the same response from LocalTill
Not much to do.....
When MtGox is like 3 days to add funds for coins....
and  BitInstant charges like 3.9% for top price coins...
BitFloor, even at a 5 hour turn-around still seems like a good deal to me. However if this doesnt get resolved today, it will be my last time using BitFloor.

Yeah, I felt like I was doing something fishy and the CVS clerk would ask what its for. Looking back Im sure they had no idea and would not even know what Bitcoins were.
I really hope this come back to the US. It was awesome running errands on my day off and just swooping into a grocery store and buying a few Bits on my way out.

Exactly! I love watching people's comments when it happens.... 
Da fuq was that? 
It's that little moment that may spark so much interest.

Hopefully this will be one of those comments that is hilarious in like 5 years.... Complaining about 0.001 Bitcoin being too small. I don't make that much in a month!!
