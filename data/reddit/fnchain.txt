Reducing supply increases demand on the remaining units, even if actual demand stays the same.   We're forced to do more with fewer units.


That's true, but marketcap is an exchange rate between BTC/$
In the distant future $ will be meaningless.

Yup, exactly.   Hodling has plenty of utility, and we have very liquid markets which allow efficient BTC &lt;-&gt; fiat conversions.
Trying to claim that bitcoin is useless with no-utility until you can perform directly exchange BTC -&gt; goods, is retarded. 
The utility difference between BTC -&gt; fiat -&gt; goods  vs  BTC -&gt; goods is negligible.    Global SoV which is accessible to anyone with a internet connections is 10000x better than anything before it.
BTC -&gt; coffee, is no better than $ -&gt; coffee.     The killer app is SoV, not medium of exchange.
@_date: 2019-06-12 00:58:11


The internet allows information to flow freely around the world.  The first apps were email, usenet, IRC, bbs, etc.  Then came the second and third waves of search, social, advertising, cloud.  But it all boils down to information transfer and we just needed one global network to do it. However, in the early days, we had a bunch of walled garden intranets popup.  Remember AOL, Compuserve, MSN, etc! RIP!!
Bitcoin the network, allows for value transfer, the first app was bitcoin (the token).  The next wave of apps will focus on leveraging value transfer in different forms. From micro payments, to international settlement of billions.   However, we had to slow down and build layers (protocols) which allow all the use cases to be possible, WITHOUT destroying decentralization.
I think dapps are a ridiculous invention for most use cases and each time you have to exchange your money at the door before using them adds enough friction that they will never catch on. 
All we need is one token that stores value, and we can use it in all the apps.    Brave doesn't need BAT,  they could sell ad time for Bitcoin, then give Bitcoin to participants.  
The same way we had multiple intranets, before everyone learned we just needed one,  today we have multiple value exchange networks.

Thanks,   When Bitcoin becomes a unit of account, there's going to be a global "repricing event".  Plus historical revisions going back to the dawn of money.  What if Man had finite units to measure value exchange from the very beginning?   It's like discovering gravity, except for finance.  And then you can go back an re-measure everything.

There is literally no difference between these:

Until merchants hodl BTC, you're wasting your time and creating downward price pressure, which further signals that fiat is a SoV and BTC value is temporary.    
HODL your BTC, and when merchants begin to BEG for you BTC, then you can spend. 
SoV comes first!

It's up to the members of Libra to decide how much of each currency they want to buy on the forex markets to "back" their shitcoin.    
I see central banks loosing control of their ability to generate inflation through tradition means.  
Eventually the Libra members will be acting like central banks and pondering things like interest rates changes to "encourage spending".   Digital currency is a panacea for economists that like to keep everyone running on the trend mill at full spend, while they siphon the gains (savings and efficiency) into their own enterprises.
Of course Bitcoin is the hedge against all of this non-sense.

@_date: 2019-06-15 06:21:35
Yes, interesting.    I've been pondering a similar thought from a different perspective. 
Why do we use USD as the unit of account for anything?   We all know it's an inflationary unit that fluctuates wildly, yet everything is priced in it.   It would be like attempting measure a wall with a Slinky.   It doesn't make any sense to measure "value" with a unit that is not finite.  In every other science we have finite units to measure things.    I think that's the core issue with economics.  It is not based in reality.  There are no hard units.  No measuring stick.   So what is "relative buying power" in terms of 21m bitcoin?  What is the value of 1m barrels of oil?

Interesting question.   The incentives seem to point to that, but I think there are exceptions, namely state actors when going to "war" against Bitcoin.

@_date: 2019-05-15 18:52:06
Bitcoin doesn't break.   The fee market sorts out high priority vs low priority transactions based on utility.    Remember Satoshi Dice?  it was priced out, low utility.   Remember storing love notes in op_return?   priced out, low utility,  etc.   Only high utility transactions will be left.   That's how markets work and Bitcoin is figuring out where the high utility transaction are.   While BSV is focusing on storing everything and will fail, because it doesn't have a pricing filter.
This is just the natural process, and bitcoin is doing a damn good job of figuring what people actually care about in this space and it sure as hell isn't buying coffee.
@_date: 2019-05-16 19:23:59


There is no solid evidence of this..  PURE speculation by the degens in crafting narratives to make their shitcoin followers happy.
Here's evidence of my claim.
@_date: 2019-05-15 17:47:36


Not really, just about anyone can purchase Bitcoin via exchanges, apps, p2p, etc, for the store of value aspect.  Using it for daily shopping, is not here yet...  But that's why so much energy is being put into LN, and if LN fails, there will be something else. 
Thinking that bitcoin must be used for daily purchases to be successful is completely missing the revolutionary value proposition.
Think of Bitcoin as a ruler.   Its fixed number of units will allow us to reprice everything using the same ruler.
Using fiat money as a unit of account is like measuring your body weight while standing on scale, on a boat, in the middle of storm.
Of course the argument against that is the bitcoin dropped 85% from the last bubble, but we're still very early and BTC is young.   It will stabilize as the price rises and liquidity increases.

@_date: 2019-05-15 17:19:39


That's ridiculous,  Bitcoin has a ton of use cases, but being hard money is probably the most profound.  Though it's only possible by having immutable consensus rules... and those rules are only immutable by having nodes scattered all over the world, working together to validate everything, but also disconnected enough to prevent easy consensus rule changes.
@_date: 2019-05-15 16:07:47
Sorry, I don't subscribe to narrative control.
@_date: 2019-05-15 16:53:45
First Liquid connects majority of exchanges, then has LBTC to shuffle BTC liquidity in minutes and now you can create securities which can flow between all those exchanges.  In addition it doesn't require an illiquid "protocol" token like so many other chains.  It's smart, and makes all other blockchains look retarded in comparison.

Bitcoin processes over 366621 transactions a day.  People are willingly and able to paying for these transactions.   It's functioning as a "p2p cash system" today and will always function like this.   
However, under the surface, it's the hardest money we've ever had and the only way that it remains hard is by ensuring consensus rules are difficult to change.  It just so happens that the primary throughput limit is also a consensus rule.    Converting BTC into a high speed, cheap payments network, so that everyone in the world can buy coffee each morning would be destructive to the decentralized p2p network which ensures consensus rules.
We're not here to give up digital gold, for cheap transactions.

No, ACH is fine, we hate the USD, which isn't backed by anything and can inflate away our wealth with a flick of pen.   This isn't about transactions per second, it's about having a sovereign store of value. 
There are tons of alternatives if you want pure tp/s and cheap fees.  However, if you want decentralized immutable money, then consensus rules have to be extremely difficult to change.   We're willing to pay more fees to prove that our consensus rules aren't up for change because of a little fee pressure.    
Besides, fees keep our miners mining.


That's a spurious correlation.  We went from 8k to 20k in a few weeks... it was time for a pullback.  No amount of tp/s would allow us to continue on that trajectory,  however, a sovereign debt crisis would propel us to infinity.
Stop thinking of Bitcoin as a payment network.  It's money, which uses a network to enforce its properties.
