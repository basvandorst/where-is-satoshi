In my opinion this is a situation where you're trying to fit a square peg into a circle slot.  Bitcoin doesn't make sense for your business.  Instead of making traditional business accept BTC, entrepreneurs should focus on what new services are available due to the freedom BTC provides.

I am going to take PETA's side on this one.  Get the pitchforks ready!
I own and operate  one of the biggest mining operations on the planet and I will most likely always stay on a big name pool.
Why?  The support and infrastructure.  We've tried all types of pools, Slush, P2P, etc. and none of these options give us the sustainability and tools that help us run our business effectively.  We average 20% more shares on well-supported pools.
It was wrong of them to make an announcement for publicity and go on it, but I bet it was from good intentions.  However, once they realized what a mess trying to configure their own pools just to make a statement is like reinventing the wheel.
My 2 cents.

Actually, due to the exponential rise in difficulty, blocks are being found 10-20% faster on average.  At this rate all coins will be mined way before 2140.  I still use the 2140 as a symbol to talk about the time of the last bitcoin mined.

Coinhoarder did some interesting things with his group buy that we opted out of.  If you saw Dalkore's group buy thread, I am his partner.  We did not let anyone purchase less than 1/3rd of a unit, and after 4 units had been ordered we did not accept less than half.  We were not willing to take small investments in order to maintain a small clientele we could offer great customer service to.
@_date: 2013-04-08 02:40:17
I agree that Bitcoin is a great alternative to traditional banking such as HSBC but there's some flaws I am seeing.
The verification of transactions is relatively quick, but not instant.  When I transfer money from my checkings to savings online it is done instantly.  Faster than the ~10 minutes for block verification on BTC transfers.
Yes, HSBC was caught and fined for money laundering.  Bitcoin does the same thing, there is just no one to blame and fine.
Online banking is always open.

Any sort of "killer app" that you speak of would centralize Bitcoin to an insane degree if it "maintained security for all users".  Sounds like a horrible idea to me.
@_date: 2013-12-23 09:08:29
Download the Bitcoin QT client and wait for the application to "sync with the network", it should take about 2-3 days if run non-stop.  Then you can add the wallet, enter the private key, and move the BTC to a fresh new wallet that only you have the new private key for (the person who gave you the current wallet will still have access).  From then on, make a backup on an external hard drive and a flash drive; do some research, some people like cloud storage, I personally do not.

We want Bitcoin mainstream adoption, but BTC will fill the needs of a niche market.  I don't ever foresee it becoming useful or purposeful for every single person.  Grandpa Joe who doesn't understand the computer, unless he is willing to put in some serious time to learn, probably shouldn't get into Bitcoin on its own.

You buy a machine that produces btc with btc.  It earns back your btc, not a dollar amount.  Yes that company is a scam, but people looking to make a quick buck, not believers in btc tend to concern themselves heavily on exchange rate.

Use the mining profitability calculator.  I live in the cheapest state in the US for power, and according to my calculations, even if the difficulty reaches 50,000,000 I will still be profiting tens of thousands of dollars within one year.

Bitcoin mining is a zero-sum game.  So I am inclined to say yes, yes it is.
@_date: 2013-05-12 16:31:22
Lol, do you know how many thousands of orders are before that?  They took preorders starting last June.  This unit will not arrive for several months; by my guess, around october or november.
@_date: 2013-03-25 13:22:28
More importantly: Butterfly Labs doesn't have a single working prototype of an ASIC miner.  If you read about why Avalon's new price is so high, it is because they believe the ROI if their units should be around month, not a matter of days.  You are downplaying "wait a while" in my humble opinion.  The rate in which you get your miner is very time sensitive, as difficulty increases, profitability greatly decreases.  If you order BFL now, you are probably in the 10s of thousands (maybe more) in line.  You will be lucky to get your unit by August if you order now (again just my speculation).  I also personally project the difficulty will be nearing or will have already exceeded 75,000,000 by this time, in which case, the profitability of your miner will not reach an ROI for a few months at least.

I'm not saying the fiat system is perfect.  Obviously it is not; but this reddit delusion that it will replace fiat completely is so strong that I doubt I could even have a reasonable conversation with you.  I disagreed with the OP of this comment, and said my belief, I did not insult his beliefs or his position.  You start your comment with insults.
@_date: 2013-12-14 00:42:41
I disagree with pretty much everything you said.  You are saying ultimately Bitcoin must fill a roll that has existed for thousands of years.  Nothing like Bitcoin has been created, it will fill neither the roll of a traditional commodity or currency.
Demand will still be high because people will still want a way to store value in a system that is much more honest and stable than government or banking institutions.  With inflation, when Bitcoin hits $10,000, think about how much $10,000 USD is going to be worth.  We have no idea what that situation will look like.  I tend to like our consumer protection laws for the most part as well.
I also disagree that we will have a separate economy of bitcoiners who will live strictly off of Bitcoin.  That will be a small niche in my opinion.  Fiat is great for 99% of my transactions, and everyone elses.  This subreddit thinks for some reason (and I've stated this many times) that little mom and pop shop adoption is what is going to make bitcoin explode.  It simply is not.  In fact I honestly think its misleading to think so, we just hype it on this board for some reason.  Bitcoin will explode from large investment fund adoption.
As an additional note, I am very open to hearing opposing opinions, and nothing in my brain is set in stone, please let me know if you have counter arguments.
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:51:25
I agree with the first part of what you said, but don't know about the second part.  If you are transferring BTC between your own personal wallets how will this auditor know whether it is a transaction for goods, or just an arbitrary transfer.  Wallets that are accessed through cryptography or the TOR network will also render the transactions difficult  to find geographically.  I don't see Bitcoin taxing being made easy any time soon, and automated not for decades.
@_date: 2013-10-22 10:01:30
i agree with you, sometimes words have specific meanings, especially associated with a new currency like bitcoin.  bitcoin has redefined mining/asic and many others.  welcome to bitcoin.

By 2140, those transaction fees are going to be worth a LOT.  That is what will sustain the network, people will still want to find new blocks, there will just be no innate block reward except fees.
@_date: 2013-03-23 02:02:18
Have you used the mining profitability calculator?  Even if the difficulty goes up to 50,000,000 they will still be profitable (although not balls to the wall)  I live in the state with the cheapest electricity costs in US and already have an office that I can run them in so I'm willing to take that risk.  Also, I expect the price of BTC to appreciate, I don't foresee a scenario where running an avalon isn't profitable, but you can bet there will be a strong ass network if there is.
@_date: 2013-07-05 01:57:21
Each Avalon runs at 5.5 amps and requires about 3500 BTUs of cooling.

Honestly, if you are buying things with your Bitcoin right now you are doing yourself a huge disservice in my opinion.  Its cute that all these "mom and pop" odd shops are accepting BTC, but investment and hedge funds are coming into BTC from China, the US, Germany, and other places.  If you have any BTC already you should be holding onto them.  We are still in the phases of early adoption and social recognition.  I understand what you are trying to do by supporting business that accept BTC, but I highly recommend not spending any of your coins on items that you could normally buy with fiat.
@_date: 2013-07-05 01:23:47
Received the units about 3 weeks ago, each unit makes about 1.75 BTC/day.  Won't share exactly how many coins I have mined sorry.  I didn't invest at all into batch 3, all units were paid for fully or split between clients.  They sent us their coins and I stayed up all night and ordered all the units together when batch 3 went live.
@_date: 2013-03-26 19:17:06
BFL does not fear backlash.  Their PR man Josh/Inaba on the bitcointalk forums  throws around wild accusations and insults everyday, ranging from bigotry to personal attacks, to releases of personal information with the intent of causing harm.  Backlash from mining with their own units... Lol.

@_date: 2013-07-05 01:04:19
These are Batch  Avalons.  I own 3 units and have 7 Batch  orders.
Yes, and no.  Yes because once you get the settings dialed in on the ASICs they just run on their own.  If there is ever a problem, a simple flip of the on/off switch gets them back mining in no time.  They are programmed to mine as soon as the units come on without any additional program starting.
No because power and heat are serious issues.  It is summer where I am now, and the need to purchase A/C and have adequate power to run these units can get tricky and pricy.
@_date: 2013-07-05 20:23:10
I don't currently run GPUs anymore, and when I did we were in a facility with free power.  I have records somewhere of power but not on hand.  We ran 3x 7 series or 3x 6 series graphics cards per motherboard and just had external home fans blowing on them.  The 7 series machines were getting 2GH/s and the 6 series just over 1.
If you have the Avalons properly cooled (~65 F) you should be able to maintain 65 GH/s per unit steady, and with re-thermal pasting and the latest firmware we are getting up to 79GH/s per unit.
The Avalons we manage now (looking to acquire clients with BFL hardware, haven't found any yet) each require 5.5 or 6 safely amps each.  At $0.07 kWh each avalon costs about $60 per month in power at our staging facility.  We get $0.02 kWh at our hosting facility.
Make sure you can get access to the amperage you need.  A 5-ton A/C unit will require 130+ amps alone, cost about $9000 and can only support about 40 Avalons.  Make sure you get an electrician to fit your operation to save you money and frustration down the road if you increase your load.
@_date: 2013-03-26 17:04:13
Worth the wait?  It depends.  If your goal is simply to turn a quick profit and quickly convert your mined BTC back into fiat dollars then no, I do not believe you will be achieving this goal.  If your goal is to join the bitcoin community, learn more about it, improve the strength of the network, help prevent against a 51% attack, and hold onto some coins for a few years then yes, It is worth the wait.
Is it too late?  Too late for what?
Will they turn a profit?  Your ROI (Return of Investment) matters on several factors.  Will the network difficulty exceed 50, 100, 150 million before you get your unit?  Perhaps.   I would not expect an ROI on your two units for at least 6-12 months considering you are somewhere around 30,000th (speculation) place in line to get your units.
Hope this helps.  I will be running my Avalon ASIC's for 3-4 years, regardless if they become unprofitable within that time.  I owe it to strengthening the network, and my investment might not be worth anything if everyone starts shutting off their miners just because they aren't making ludicrous profits.

This is the processing facility for Avalon ASICs, the only running ASIC on the market at the moment.  Yifu Guo, the owner and creator of BitSyncom LLC started manufacturing ASICs so that Butterfly Labs (BFL) would not have the market cornered.  BFL announced their shipping date in October of last year, and have yet to even produce a working prototype.  Avalon has blown them out of the water and is opening up their 3rd batch at 8:30 EST this morning.  Look at my other post in this thread to see the difference in professionalism and quality.  They did not intend to ship more than one batch, however, since their competitors are barely showing to be competition, they are continuing to sell more batches and develop 2nd Gen. hardware.

I personally will be going in on Batch   The reason the price was raised according to Yifu is because the unit should take a month (at least) in order to pay for itself.  At the Batch  and Batch  price, the units would pay for themselves in just over a week.  Avalon's first and foremost reason for getting into the business is the strengthen the network.

If bitcoin is to succeed, it will do so without these public service announcements which bear very little to no impact on the global economy.  This is unimportant.
