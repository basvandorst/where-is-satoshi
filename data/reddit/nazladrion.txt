Because BTC has declined within the first 50 days, every year, except for 2011 and 2013.
@_date: 2018-01-18 05:27:25
I'm gonna say we hit 5.5k to 6k before the end of February. All the suckers should be cleared out by then.
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:04:38
You ROCK! Thanks!

I love your math! I was wondering... could you throw in past predictions based on the years before a price was hit?
For example:
10k: 2015-2016; 2014-2016; 2013-2016; 2012-2016; 2011-2016; July 2010-2016
5k: 2015-2016; 2014-2016; 2013-2016; 2012-2016; 2011-2016; July 2010-2016
1k: 2014-2015; 2013-2015; 2012-2015; 2011-2015; July 2010-2015
One more thing. Some statistical [work]( I programmed using Coindesk data. (Based on median and median absolute deviation)

u/giszmo and u/omni_wisdumb 
Out of curiosity, I did a logarithmic linear regression on the daily price of bitcoin (downloaded from coindesk). Apparently, a linear model fits well (R^2 ~ 0.8), however, a 2^nd order polynomial model fits better at ~0.91.
With this in mind, I took the 1^st derivative on the price of bitcoin with respect to time. I anticipated some bias, however, the linear regression of d($/BTC)/dt is ~0.0005t-21 with large changes in amplitude about the median of 0.01 and average of ~0.41. There were massive changes in slope (e.g. - Mt. Gox and this December), but overall there has been almost no change in *general* slope since the birth of bitcoin. (i.e. - the *rate of value increase* is not increasing/snowballing)
TL;DR - It would appear that Bitcoin has been (and still is) very steady since its inception, despite events like Mt. Gox. Its almost too perfect, imo, like it was deliberately engineered to consistently increase and be HIGHLY resilient to changes in overall trend. Any reasonable "predictions", albeit unusually considering real economics, should suggest that by 2020-21 the price of a bitcoin will be ~52,500 +/- 30,000 using a log-corrected linear model. November 2022: ~500,000.

ELI5 of image: Don't spend bitcoin until it is finally **the only** accepted currency everywhere, since it will eventually be the first truly global currency. By then .... well ..... nanoXBP&gt;$1.

Remember, Bitcoin is more a measure of privacy, which can be seen as a commodity. Investment in untraceable commodities helps to secures one's future assets from loss or seizure. Considering typical Republican policies on privacy, I expected Bitcoin to surge a little bit.

RemindMe! September 15th, 2018 "It's over $90,000!"
@_date: 2017-11-27 06:11:26
This will never get old for me now. I always stop it at 1:10 and rewatch like 5 more times...
@_date: 2018-03-21 12:04:00
[The first time this happened](
@_date: 2017-05-26 18:49:30
So...I should HODL, right?
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:06:32
For the inquisitive, I used end of day price from Coindesk's ".csv" data. The end of 2010 is not shown, but the beginning of 2017 is shown.
Robust price scaling was done to normalize the data for an unknown distribution (i.e.: Median = 0 $/BTC/Day; Median Absolute Deviation = 1). 
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:10:59
This is a daily price chart in $/BTC for each year. [But its really unitless! ;D]
Years are colored differently with 2017 in bold grey.
I scaled the daily prices so comparisons could be inferred for everybody's recent theory crafting. :)
@_date: 2017-05-26 22:57:39
Statistics isn't about predicting the value. I made this because I was curious about trend correlations between years. For example, look at day of year 15-25. The current year, 2016, 2015, and 2014 all have a dip right at that same time. Funny enough...January 16th is MLK day. Unusual... Anyway, enjoy the exploration! :)

People were likely trading between BTC and ETH to net BTC profits because of ETH's faster acceleration. This naturally ties them together (apart from both being cryptos). As BTC goes down, people will follow the trades right along with it to min/max profits.
@_date: 2017-05-26 23:29:00
The hard part is that I need more years...but BTC too young. :(
I think there might be some yearly correlations, though. Seasonal variations, international trends, cultural intersections, and the like all occur over yearly or multi-year scales. Just...need...more...data... X3
@_date: 2017-05-26 23:01:50
I thought that too, at first! Unfortunately, I realized that I cant make that determination until 2020 because the trend could be just odd numbered years are volatile :(
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:14:30
Honestly, I'm not saying anything conclusive. Statistically, I can only draw conclusions about the data on hand. So, what I can say is the scaled trend of early 2017 looks a helluva lot like early 2011.
Working on a hyper-dimensional analysis with Fisher's LDA to see if I can classify months based on the scaled prices.
@_date: 2017-05-26 21:30:50
It would appear so, within this quarter. Plus, the scale of this year is off because the median isn't finalized. :S
@_date: 2017-05-26 22:59:38
Mt. Gox Almighty. That event deviated from the BTC median price by ~300 median absolute deviations! It was off the charts!
@_date: 2017-05-26 22:53:02
Only the 2017 graphic would need adjustment, fortunately. This year is not yet complete, so we are looking at the current 1-2nd quarter median-centered values and median absolute deviations (MAD). At least, it gets more accurate every day! ;D
The rest are fine. You can see Mt. Gox off in the '13-4Q. That sucker deviates by ~300 MADs from that year's median! 8O It is LITERALLY off the charts.
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:22:03
That actually might be a reasonable statement. Most years trend into some kind of decline during the third quarter; however, Mt. Gox was wierd and 2016 was fairly stable. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 23:11:58
That guy's final statement that the end.


ROFL HODL!
@_date: 2017-07-05 10:59:39
So what is different between then and now?
@_date: 2017-06-13 15:44:48
...time...to hodl.
@_date: 2017-06-06 03:27:16
LOCKED AND LOADED!
