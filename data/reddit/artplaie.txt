"As a trader" your advice should be to have a thesis and stick to it. Not some random mumbo jumbo bullshit equating Bitcoin with a stock.

It really doesn't. No money has an infinite velocity, people hold on to it for some time.
Look up MV = PQ and velocity.

Bitcoiners should remove CoinMarketCap from their bookmarks.

Within some tolerance in your country you may not even be supposed to, and regardless you definitely don't _have_ to in practice.

I'd be happy to spend my Bitcoin instead of having to pay taxes on it ...

Sooo, you have a kid, and should anything happen to you he'll have to pass on $1.8M because you wanted to be "pragmatic"?

It's thoroughly hopeless to request anything from CoinMarketCap whose sole business is the paid promotinon of scams, be that coins or exchanges.  
Rather, remove them from your bookmarks and use OnChainFX or LiveCoinWatch.

It's hard to think of something that would make you sound dumber than calling Jihan "Jihad".

It's a matter of habit, after ~5 years doing this you'll be shovelling dozens of BTCs in a couple clicks without giving a damn.

Yeah as I mentioned in the annex, I have not been over the future contracts.
If memory serves they boast around $40 BILLION on BTC/USD. "A decent fill" is the bare minimum I'd expect :)

To those who say "that's not survivorship bias, all HODLERS made money". 
The survivorship bias, in this case, applies not to bitcoin holders, but to Bitcoin as a whole.
Bitcoin is the one in a hundred of assets that people have HEDL on to (beyond reason the OP suggests) that performed that well.
While I think OP is ultimately right in trying to nuance the HODL fashion, I think his form is off and his rationale poorly explained.
In the specific case of this specific crisis in particular, no fundamentals have changed whatsoever, and whatever China's doing was expected at some point.
The market is just over-correcting due to a lack of support in the $3k - $4k price range, but whoever bought Bitcoin before the crisis, regardless of the price, should stick to the same reasoning that motivated them in the first place, and indeed .... 
HODL !

If only we had forked to Bitcoin Unlimited, Roger Ver, first Bitcoin investor and newly appointed Bitcoin CEO for life, would kick that old crone's ass.

Whoever thinks that other cryptos shall remain unaffected is sorely misled IMHO.
ETH, in particular, should take a massive hit. Indeed I would wager the sole reason why the currency held after its massive pump this year is because it was very much needed to sustain the ICO bubble. 
It could have gone much lower straight after the Parity hack, and I believe the sole reason it did not was because it was used to sustain that absurd ICO craze. 
This could very well ring the bell for the absurd ICO valuations ("*we need 3 graduate software engineers for 3 months, that'll be $10 million, tyvm*"). If it does, down goes ETH midterm (well, crypto-midterm, maybe a month, maybe two, but still)
As for other cryptos well. In the very short term everything is oddly interconnected, and they will be affected as well.

It really depends on how much money the guy's making or expects to make, and how badly he needs those $100k. Utility of money is non-linear.
It follows that you're both idiots, and that guy probably as well, since most people are anyway.

Should this technically mean that you ought to pay taxes on altcoin trading when you realise a winning trade and convert back into bitcoin, just like you should when trading forex ?
(regardless of what people will actually do, which is nothing)

For the most part they're indeed either insane, idiots or liars, whether they realize it or not.
Each 50% decline has had a number of those "hodlers" more or less quietly tiptoeing to the exit, often unconsciously changing their mental framing, often to the tune of : "well Bitcoin has failed" or "not what I signed up for".
A further decline to the previous cycle levels would have triggered a whole new narrative, and many more currently adamant hodlers would have deserted.
And this is fine. 
(So too regarding parabolic price increases. People who pretend they haven't deleveraged a penny after a 100-fold increase are either actively lying or thoroughly dense)

At this point I don't think whatever little harm he can still do should deprive us of his immense entertainment value.
