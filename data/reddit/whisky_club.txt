We got as far as working out a distribution chain and I've spent the morning trying to source bottles at prices we can reasonably mark up for profit without being far too expensive compared to other online stores. 
What we're trying to do here is find out if the niche market Whiskey_Club believes in actually exists. So if we did get this off the ground, would any of you be interested?

Nope, this is the Scottish guy who Whiskey_Club was talking to. Figured I'd follow the naming convention he started :P
Bourbon is any form of whisky made from fermented corn syrup. 
Whisky/ey is made from rye or barley. The main difference between the two being that Scotch whisky is distilled twice and whiskey is distilled 3 times.

Don't see a reason we couldn't off the top of my head, but you'd potentially end up paying a steep shipping fee. Would that be a problem?

Bourbon is brewed in Tennessee and other places around the states, whiskey is brewed in Ireland and whisky is brewed in Scotland.

The main difference between Scotch and whisky is geographic - they're the same thing but one of them is from Scotland. Whiskey and Bourbon are different ways of producing the spirit from different materials. Whisky is always malted barley, no other grain. Bourbon is distilled from corn syrup and whiskey will often mix in other grains.
Purists like myself will say most whisky not from Scotland isn't worth drinking, but to be fair I mainly say that because I've had some of the Japanese muck and it tasted like diesel.
