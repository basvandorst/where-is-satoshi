Don't forget the ecological disaster on top of the slow and inefficient database.

Nah, it's the official "shit says" coin - literally *Shitcoin*.

I'm not sure about anything, and I don't feel competent to give advice, I just visit this sub out of morbid curiosity every now and then. I'm basing my opinion as a whole on the fact that literally everyone and everything relating to crypto that I've ever had contact with or observed (outside of maybe a few developers and the original idea) has been governed by greed and the propensity to scam people.

Not sure if troll or if this is what people into crypto really think like. 
If latter, please, go read up any economics 101 book.

Uselessness 
@_date: 2018-03-29 13:22:37
Scarcity means nothing without demand. 
Right now, the only organic demand for Bitcoin (outside of illicit use and speculation) is actually created by shitcoins, which is a double edged sword that's almost guaranteed to doom the crypto scene. 
If shitcoins/ICOs continue at this rate, as soon as all these projects start getting exposed for scams that they are, they'll bring down the "legit" cryptocurrencies down with them. 
If shitcoins/ICOs get shut down and/or regulated (shut down being loosely defined - I take Google, Facebook, and Twitter banning crypto ads a part of this), Bitcoin loses out on people cashing out on their scams. 
It's doomed to fail. It's all a scam.

You just won the "shit says" award for the month of March. It was a late entry, but well worth the wait.
@_date: 2018-03-30 11:59:39
Yeah, and it's been one for all 8 years.
@_date: 2018-03-29 14:23:40
Technology behind a lot of things is just fine, but still used for scams. I don't see the point you're trying to make. Either way, I understand the technology. I see value in a non-modifiable ledger, though I don't really think it's worth the ecological disaster that Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are creating.
99% of it is a scam. If you're not aware of it, you're most likely on the receiving end of it.

We agree:


I literally don't see any real world problem that Bitcoin solves, not even close to justify the negatives it creates, the power consumption being the main one. Perhaps it wasn't all a get rich quick scheme from day one, but it was in the first month or so that it turned into one, and remains so.

Said the guy advocating hodling.
@_date: 2018-04-01 18:23:43


lol it's definitely not just for the sake of it. It's to get some suckers in, get some cash out. Which is a scam.
@_date: 2018-12-13 13:21:07
Because it doesn't solve a single problem the people have, and the user experience when using it is awful. 
@_date: 2018-12-13 15:37:56
What problems or a normal person who wants to pick up their paycheck and spend some of their money does it solve?
@_date: 2018-12-13 17:18:11
lol, this one takes the cake. At least you don't even pretend that it has a real-world use, so I'll give you that. 
@_date: 2018-12-13 16:39:39
Normal person = someone employed who receives money on monthly basis, spends some of it on bills and necessities, the rest on leisure and activities. Name me one benefit of using Bitcoin for that type of person. 
@_date: 2018-12-13 16:50:15
Former are rent and bills, and latter, leisure and activities = occasionally going out and spending a few dollars on stuff like Netflix or anything that isn't a basic necessity.
That's basically 90% of people. 
@_date: 2018-12-13 17:14:58
I didn't. I was simply talking about a regular employed person, whose spending habits are largely similar across the globe, you got into semantics and interpreted it the way you did, then made presumptions about where I live.
And even if I did, here it is clarified for you.
So please now do share what problems does Bitcoin solve for those people. 
@_date: 2018-12-13 17:04:26
Eastern Europe. And if you are done arguing semantics, please go back to providing the examples of what problems Bitcoin solves, of which you so far have exactly zero.
