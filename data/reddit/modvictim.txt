It's not panic selling by domestic investors. It's Chinese investors selling on behalf of their state handlers.  
A lot of companies posted decent profit but experts cannot explain the selling so instead they're assuming.
@_date: 2018-10-30 23:28:58
Dont they print money anyways?  
That should be the argument.
@_date: 2019-08-15 19:29:54
Chinese Scam in the headlines again... shocker.

You: Oh look, I found some money.  
Government: "REEEEEEEEE"

China is Asshole

Yeah but that doesn't explain the actual process. (Which was something I wanted to know)

Well being born into society vs being an adult are two different things. I'm not saying you shouldn't be held to the same standard as everybody else. I'm arguing that:  
* Taxation with Consent is a chief cornerstone to America.
* And the government has decided long ago it no longer requires our consent. 
* And the masses agree.
Simple really.

Financial Advisers will never suggest forex as an investment vehicle. It's used for speculation and "get rich quick" schemes where many fools are parted from their money. But doesn't change the fact that currency is not a primary investment vehicle. Sorry that the truth disappoints you but a lot of butthurt crypto casuals are quickly finding out about this truth. Yourself included.
@_date: 2018-11-20 19:38:54
Yes? And?

Banksters having a circlejerk right now.

I'm actually very happy not having to pay any bank or credit card fees. Thanks!

Looks like this sub is astroturfed by big banking. Too bad you can never kill bitcoin.   
The dinosaur is raging in futility right now.
@_date: 2018-11-20 18:32:25
I'm arguing against it from a moral position. The concept of tax as necessary is a huge sliding scale.


By virtue of birth. Not consent. Huge difference.

You want a good faith response on how to promote btc as an investment vehicle?  


The current market says otherwise.
@_date: 2018-11-07 15:46:07
Pardon if I dont hold my breath.
@_date: 2018-11-28 06:32:24
You do understand that bitcoin is designed to be a form of currency and not a mattress right?
@_date: 2018-11-28 02:03:47
Why is he buying it?
@_date: 2018-11-20 18:18:45
Your logic is flawed.
\- Me buying internet or a phone is me CONSENTING to the transaction.
\- The government is not a business entity that provides goods and services. If you want the government to be a literal monopoly on goods and services there are plenty of other countries that provide that at gunpoint if you wish.   But America is not one of those countries and you clearly do not understand what "Free Market" is.


Show me where you consented to Obama drone striking women and children. Show me where you consented to the CIA toppling governments. Show me where you consented to allowing the government to spy on every man, woman and child in the United States?
Clearly, you're a fool if you think we still have collective rule.
Also the concept of the income tax was a 20th century invention. Our country ran just fine without it.

Took a break from crypto for 3 years. Came back to this: people bitching about bitcoin. These aren't adopters. They're either newbros or butthurt bankers.

So you think people are idiots for thinking that having a gun pointed at your head and taking your money is a "good" thing? Fascinating.

Isn't there a bank exec you should be kissing up to?

Oh so you deliberately violate Rule 2? Okay, thanks for clarifying.

BTC isnt designed to be an investment vehicle

If bitcoin is a "useless investment", why the fuck are you here?
@_date: 2018-11-20 14:08:46
Is this r/bitcoin or r/FederalReserve ?
@_date: 2019-09-26 15:52:22
What's actually going to happen is that Venezuela is going to liquidate their reserves via bitcoin. I'm no expert but I'm not sure if that fares well for bitcoin but I could be wrong.
