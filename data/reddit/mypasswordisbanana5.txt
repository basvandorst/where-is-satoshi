Had a discussion in r.iota or r.ethereum, I forget, about the potential for car parks to automatically charge you using smart money and so on. All the car parks I use already do that for a few years now by reading number plates on entry and exit.

Moving your coins to a new address on the btc blockchain is a precaution. Probably not required but why not do something so simple to be so safe?
If you had coins before August 1 they will be on both the btc and bcc blockchains. That's it. 
Fire up a bcc client and load your private keys that existed before August 1. You have bcc.

Blockchain technology is great and all, but it's not "the internet in the  80s". The use cases are far, far more limited than The Internet.
Honestly I think currency is its killer app. We've already found it. There's not much else it can be used for *en masse*.

1. Make a **new wallet**. Send ALL your bitcoin to the **new wallet**.
2. Sign up for an exchange like hitBTC, poloniex, whatever. This is where you'll exchange your Bitcoin Cash (BCC) for Bitcoin (BTC).
3. I downloaded the BitCoin Cash wallet [Electron Cash]( but use whichever you prefer.
4. Import your paper wallets into the BCC wallet client thingy. You'll see you have the old BTC balance in BCC. Free magic internet money!
5. Send your BCC to the exchange and exchange.
Just make sure you do STEP 1 correctly. Make sure your **old wallets** have 0 bitcoin balance. They will, magically, still have BCC balance.
Sometimes Bitcoin Cash uses BCH instead of BCC. They couldn't even get that right.

How does that mean the larger hub will be able to create lower fees though? It's all ROI; it's all a percentage.
If I invest $100k in time lock contracts and I want to return 1% over a month (I've no idea what a practical time might be), I need to make 10,000 transactions @ 10c per transaction.

I don't see how centralization that is not on the actual bitcoin blockchain matters at all. Lightning Network is another, separate layer that doesn't affect the actual bitcoin blockchain at all.
Let me know if I've got that wrong. 
As for "centralization" what is Coinbase and the like?

: ) doesn't that scale exactly the same too?!
10% of my channels for eBay, 25% for Amazon...
to go off topic a little *most* of my online shopping is done with a small number of merchants, like Amazon. It's entirely likely I *would* have my own channels for my frequent ...exchange money for things places.
Smaller merchants might like to join a hub, I guess. This whole thing just reads like a familiar market.
Anyway, this whole thing takes place **off the main blockchain** so *that* remains decentralized. And that is the important bit.

If you have paid off your mortgage faster then expected you can "redraw" that money. Or, you can just get a loan using the equity on your home for whatever the fuck you want. Strippers and cocaine if you fancy.

So... let me see if I can ELI5 this for myself. (apologies, i hadn't even heard of Tethers until this morning)
Tethers (USDT) are an "alt coin" created to be fixed 1:1 to the $USD. Useful if you want to cash out of crypto currency for a while~~, and/or if you don't want to pay capital gains tax~~. Not a bad idea on the surface.
However, because they are an unregulated alt coin all sorts of funny stuff can go on in the back room. It would appear that there are more USDT in the crypto markets than there are USD in the Tether bank accounts; someone has been printing out unbacked USDT. Uh-oh.
The only places that trade USDT are affiliated or connected somehow to the same people behind/issuing USDT? A few crypto exchanges? Bit suspicious.
Spikes in bitcoin prices line up very neatly with surges in USDT issuances (correct word?), so it could be supposed that the fake USDT was being used to buy and sell and buy and sell bitcoin, over and over again, to and from the same people, thus manipulating the price. Yikes.
**tl;dr** They have their own, completely unregulated printing press for a currency that is exchangeable for bitcoin. ^^(Fuuuuuck!)
This is just great combined with the $US5,000 wall, the EU4,000 wall, and the China ICO thing. ^^/s It explains the recent btc/usd drop quite well.
This is good for bitcoin.


It'll survive. Again. It's going through more trial-by-fire. Again. The longer it lasts the longer it will last. It just won't die, this thing. And ultimately that gives it dependability, which is exactly what you want in a store of value/currency/new paradigm/whateveritis. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 11:41:08
Well, that's how it is *supposed* to work. It looks more and more like they just issue them to themselves, buy bitcoin with it, which raises the value, rinse and repeat.
There's no Proof Of Work or anything. There is nothing to say they have the same amount of USD as there is USDT in circulation.
**They have their own, completely unregulated printing press for a currency that is exchangeable for bitcoin.**
Even if they aren't doing what they are accused of *they can*. What sort of a person *wouldn't* be tempted?
@_date: 2017-09-05 11:57:14
True that, but I've made mine on a completely offline computer, and then wiped the computer. I could go full tin-foil hat but I'm not that concerned; it's play money on that address. I did it all as a fun, educational exercise.
I also have a hardware wallet, and totally agree with you. It's a mini air-gapped computer in a way. Far, far more convenient.
An alternative is something like bitkey.io

*Technically* Bitcoin is not affected, its exchange value is affected. It's like people paying far too much for a car because the dealer was shonky; the car is still exactly the same. 1btc = 1 btc.
However, it's obviously a problem for bitcoin on another level, and that's a level that people care about quite a lot.
Because the crypto exchanges are not regulated anything can happen in them, and it clearly does. Go watch some of the shit coins for a while.
Perhaps an exchange or two can agree to self regulate in a totally transparent fashion? Perhaps they use the same rules that stock exchanges use? Perhaps they will garner a lot of support form the community who will only use those exchanges as a result?
The onus is really on the exchanges.

Generally *ahead* in technology because it is a small country and it is easier to implement things nationally.

Nah, I don't actually want that bullshit again. I was expecting it to be picked up by fund managers, and have layer 2 apps take us to the next level. Perhaps that is on hold for a while. Damn.


We could argue that their estimated $80m in funny money is a drop in the bucket. [There's a whale I follow]( that drops that much every month or so anyway. As a percentage of transactions $80m isn't much.
But, we don't know how much they churned that $80m.
But also, and more importantly, we don't know how much *anybody* churns the market in that fashion, buying from and selling to themselves with large orders. **It's a completely unregulated exchange system. It's completely open to price manipulation.**
I'd like to think that bitcoin is more secure than the other altcoins because of its size, but once large players enter the market they can control *the price* simply because they are larger than everyone else. It's the same for any unregulated crypto, and of course even regulated currencies.
It's a problem Bitcoin doesn't solve. In fact it completely ignores it.
I'd love to be proven wrong.

**Tl;dr**: There's bitcoin and there is Bitcoin, and they are actually the same thing.
Capital 'B' Bitcoin is the payment system. Little 'b' bitcoin is the currency. They are one and the same thing and unlike the way a currency like the dollar can be transferred using PayPal, EFT, Visa or whatever bitcoin can *only* be transferred by Bitcoin. And Bitcoin is pretty damn good in and of itself.
The intrinsic value of bitcoin is Bitcoin.

Those tethers can be used to buy a large order at +2% the market rate, and another at +2% again, and so on.
Transaction B buys from transaction A, which then buys +2% from B again, which buys +2% from A again, and so on; they get reused. Of course A and B are the same person/people.
$391m, or even a small percentage of it, is more than enough to play this game with profitable outcomes. And if it fails who cares; just create more out of thin air.
**Tethers are a good idea, but it is neither a trustless system nor a transparent system.** 
We have to trust strangers on the internet for tethers to work.
