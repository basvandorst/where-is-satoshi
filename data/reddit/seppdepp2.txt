How much can do btc now and with full SW adoption (and when) ?
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:41:47
Bitfinex reverted today - so this is funny...
@_date: 2017-12-12 10:14:39
Where is the freedom when you cannot move BTC for mostly free any more?
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:11:35
But the thing is user activated.hmm
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:37:34
First I have bitcoin since 2011 and got bch for free. Second I beleive that it's more open to all options also due to a minimalization of the base protocoll. As we know it from TCP/IP, smtp, FIX, SWIFT,... as smaller and simpler any protocol is, it will be spread and decentralized by multiple client impls just because its so simple. SW is the opposit and has bottlenecks exactly at client impl companies. So at a very high level it is seen that too much techno is needed to get BTC back to 'work'. Or you try to say btc is ONLY store of value, but I ve issues to beleive this will be sustainable if all other network effects drop to zero.
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:01:15
About fees as well?
@_date: 2017-12-03 10:27:32
On-chain tech was live-tested for about 9 years now and still not all risk savvey companies think it is save to use. What time you give SW, LN, ...?
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:58:06
Wasn't that also about friction less usage / low transaction costs? .. hmm...
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:30:08
Because I saw a closed internet eco system coming up .
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:58:26
Yes I m in this boat. And I like E=m c ^2 .  The genius part of it. The rest is up to be filled out by pure client impl.
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:13:02
Yes - he mentions 1 dollar....
@_date: 2017-12-14 05:30:06
Hmmm, think that real use cases of LN are very limited in the beginning. Who wants to put much value TX in it at first place?
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:34:44
He did not say nullifying ;)
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:34:58
I do not trust anybody. I do my own analysis and see it different. But I really like open competition that makes most products better for consumer.
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:24:49
But why would you want to hop chains ?
@_date: 2017-12-14 05:33:21
Yeah, lets see.
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:55:30
Yep. So no wonder that community, implementation, ideas .... are decentral as well.
@_date: 2018-08-08 10:55:42
@_date: 2018-08-14 19:52:11
They aggregate offers at the street site and will show some marked up price on the client side.
@_date: 2018-05-02 20:13:08
And why the heck do we need such in a decentralized censorship free open market crypto world at all?
@_date: 2018-05-26 15:45:56
You mean, you re happy having stuff more centralized?
@_date: 2018-05-22 05:29:42
@_date: 2018-05-14 19:19:57
They do proper risk anaysis first? Impl is very last if all risks are known and mitigated.
@_date: 2018-08-14 19:56:11
Who do you think is caculating the risk?
@_date: 2017-08-28 19:59:23
I expected Richard to say, he is a real Bitcoinmaximalist, but then .... he just pulled out lots of alt shills... argh!?
@_date: 2017-08-09 19:32:59
Yeahhh. Make fees great again! Woooohooo
@_date: 2017-08-28 12:54:29
Thx. So we only dispute about 'reasonable'.
@_date: 2017-08-21 07:55:30
No. Its all about on-chain security comes first. All other systems are by factors more unsecure and have not approved 8 years of bitcoin's onchain test phase.
@_date: 2017-08-10 18:14:25
Miners have invested a lot for long term success. What have you done?
@_date: 2017-08-31 06:37:41
Exactly same you could say for SW. A HF was discussed and agreed on many years ago (HK,...). If some are not prepared NOW, they make it contentious and put peace and reputation on risk- peace :)
@_date: 2017-08-20 13:51:37
Huh? What will be the expected costs of that and the date this will be reached?
And why should not many merchants affort this infrastucture THEY need ( their risk ) to run we expect to have by that date as well?
@_date: 2017-08-30 16:51:39
Yeah, and also the LN potential is not clear. I still hope for that NYA - peace :)
@_date: 2017-08-24 18:20:33
We only see a reaction to an unreached consensus or compromis over an critical protocol upgrade and maybe a proof that HF and 8MB just can be done. Not sure if it will last for ever, but its an experiment. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 17:49:25
I once lost my first bitcoin in bitmarket.eu ... But this was my personal fault not learning enough, but old community was good and tight- only fighting against legacy financial systems, and I had nothing to do here.
Now I got really in rage about this (yes grown) entire community that might lose this fight, because of self distruction - mostly about a single line of the protocol, how stupid ARE WE?
@_date: 2017-08-21 15:45:50
I hear you. And I hear also that there is still more capacity for on-chain for about 2-3 years. Given this is realistic, we both know that hardware and network will work for scalability for free in that period.
No reason to bribble yet, but yes, let 2nd layer show if they can run with decent security. But they are clearly not same trustless! Don't try to sell this without proper disclaimer!
@_date: 2017-08-31 19:09:46
Yeah  neutral in Europe would be Switzerland. Basel where the BIS is....
@_date: 2017-08-28 09:33:23
If it is not quantum mech pls put it down here, or stop trolling.
@_date: 2017-08-24 21:18:39
Bitcoin itself is one. SW is one of the most dicussed change. Experiments are done not knowing the final outcome for sure. We know mostly nothing and only can learn here or stay stupid.
@_date: 2017-08-21 17:47:28
It is all about the longest chain...
@_date: 2017-08-21 16:12:41
Maybe ShapeShift?
@_date: 2017-08-26 19:47:22
I'd rather say big blockers want open competition and freedom. All scaling options are absolutely needed in exponential growing envs! We cannot afford surpressing single options with politic reasoning and bad behaviors.
@_date: 2017-08-20 11:41:18
With the tiny detail of enabeling others (alts, 2nd layer) scale it easier, but worse secure.
@_date: 2017-08-21 17:14:14
That's rediculous. The exponential growth will overcompensate this. Right now only Japan sees big shops using it, because of high fees. Shop adopition is bribbled to die for many months now.
@_date: 2017-08-30 16:06:03
NYA was not only signed by miners. There might be some xk nodes on btc1 from many mearchants as well.
@_date: 2017-08-28 20:03:12
Value is given by the reputation, community size and the exponential growth. The price is volatile due to that since it contains lots of future events. Hope the growth is not bribbled because that is bad for the price and value.
@_date: 2017-08-09 19:57:53
What a pitty. But why is this? Did you really try da help or was your feedback sort of offensive? - Thing is we are all funny human here, esp the very intelligent ones...
@_date: 2017-08-20 11:46:29
I guess it is a trade off to knowing the 90+% miners behind. So what should happen? Protect the minority chain? This is left to them.
@_date: 2017-08-28 08:35:41
Greed is stabilizing bitcoin together with Nash Equilibrium. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 16:09:51
Nah, its more like store of value vs usability (on- chain). Sure you can make a big fuzz out of this simple difference. In the end we all want the same, but the order and the way differs.
@_date: 2017-08-20 11:38:08
How could it get real mainstream if big merchants and long time adopers get kicked on political reasons?
@_date: 2017-08-09 05:39:12
I agrree that for proper exponantial scaling we need all sorts of scaling options and all sorts of teams working on theses TOGETHER in a harmonic way. The market will decide what works. Single brains just cannot!!!
@_date: 2017-08-29 12:43:09
Given that hashpower is a very expensive and long term good and owners of these goods are doing intensive risk management for sure ( or might be all idiots ?) and come to this conclusion in a majority you (not majority)  seemed to be concened about, makes me concerned as well.
@_date: 2017-08-28 09:31:19
Big economic relevant users already agreed and gave SW a start, so where is the point?
@_date: 2017-08-24 22:09:41
I want freedom with simple solutions. E=mc^2.    :)
@_date: 2017-08-20 15:43:32
No, you can never scale that way, sorry.
Merchants will take care enough because they need to ensure reputation. Nobody can really request this from any single poor user. You live a nice dream but not a realizable one.
@_date: 2017-08-20 11:50:24
BCore is just too restrictive in my view. I'm more about freedom of choice and open up all sorts of scaling. This is really needed for exponential growth. Decentralization is balanced with that perfectly.
@_date: 2017-08-28 11:55:17
I m not impressed. 
Lists against counterlists. 
Basless wishlists?
There is no investment and power weight that could give us closer insight. 
We only know actions have been already executed and NYA saved us from a poor UASF splitt. BCH showed a HF and big blocks could work ok.
I would feel better if we could all honore these moves.
@_date: 2017-08-26 12:49:39
It is only an 'attack' if you don't wanna find a bigger consensus.
@_date: 2017-08-24 18:10:27
I like your pragmatic view! We can chill once masses can use bitcoin and we have freedom. Politics is poison for any success.
@_date: 2017-08-04 20:31:47
The attacks might come by skipping SW txs ?
@_date: 2018-06-15 18:00:33
And might not pass much regulators desk though.
@_date: 2018-06-07 12:03:07
Any ERC20 coin is a sec per definition.
@_date: 2018-06-15 19:46:10
Sure, but it would make a world wide acceptance and use much easier...
@_date: 2018-06-15 17:52:30
Very good comment here..I also say last legal words are not spoken yet.. Further I want you to expand you good analysis into second layer systems and their tokens derived from its underlyings?
@_date: 2017-11-19 10:33:56
And the Zimbaweian? and and and... 90% of all human?
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:29:31
@_date: 2017-11-06 13:15:28
Thanx for this ^   It might help some lost ppl in this dark November.
@_date: 2017-11-05 13:58:09
Nope. Bitcoin is faster!
@_date: 2017-11-24 19:29:28
SwissQuote is a broker.
@_date: 2017-11-16 10:40:30
If others say it's a bubble - it mostly isn't. A bubble needs to be supported by the lemmings - so pls go on street and ask who has bitcoin... no it's not a bubble.  
@_date: 2017-11-21 08:30:27
Nice Hodle Boddle
@_date: 2017-11-15 10:23:43
Time line?
@_date: 2017-11-06 09:49:03
Yeah, but this sounds really like a new alt coin / CobraCoin?
@_date: 2018-06-27 16:56:02
It is a stress test, announced, planned and mostly open sourced. It will rather help BCH network to improve...
@_date: 2017-09-25 16:48:36
Agreed. Falcon is not a retail bank.
@_date: 2017-09-19 12:34:34
It could be less code .. you are right - I m as well doing / changing these stuff.
And this is exactly what scares me with SW.
@_date: 2017-09-29 08:26:59
Thats wrong . There are other devs like Sergio as well. Not to forget the many devs sitting in the NYA IT-offices. 
@_date: 2017-09-25 15:28:56
Swiss Falcon Privatbank was first with Bitcoin embracing.
@_date: 2017-09-30 07:52:45
Yeah. Case for CIA and NSA?
@_date: 2017-09-27 07:34:52
Was that intentional or reaction?
I'm a fan of doing proper analysis - so go to the roots where the split was seeded - pls.
@_date: 2017-09-03 15:35:39
I'd say, we are here to fairly compete with legacy fin systems. Key features need to be usability, otherwise the competition is over quicker than a lightening.
@_date: 2017-09-18 10:38:25
Economic support can be measured indirectly or implicitly by long-term stake at risk.
I 'd say NYA IS as close as possible to those. These guys have valued the bigger econimics and concluded to put more stake than others up to risk for that and up to the future.
@_date: 2017-09-19 17:30:54
What are the real reputation factors?
@_date: 2017-09-11 17:40:15
End of the day only people can give power to a blockchain. The structure of these people is not really relevant in first place. Corps are run by people and if people do not buy there thing is decided.
@_date: 2017-09-13 17:19:50
But allow OTC trading - huh?
@_date: 2017-09-29 08:24:10
Agreed, and it was already locked in. Breaking out is not a good idea.
@_date: 2017-09-28 09:55:52
The NYA ship has sailed long time ago with big noise, IMO you cannot do much with long posts here any more. The last rational decision was to get core in the boat or parts of from who could agree on a 2x? 
@_date: 2017-09-23 16:33:42
Can sb twitter Amazon accepts BCC or 2X ?   :)
@_date: 2017-10-04 10:30:52
Expert speeking ?
@_date: 2017-09-18 05:38:10
It's always a long term risk/reward dicision. We see this with ongoing adoption that also risk managers are adopted more and more. We just have to deal with that or stay nichy..  
@_date: 2017-09-29 09:35:12
Hehe - no - I work for trading section
@_date: 2017-09-02 17:14:00
Empty your own mempool and Verget, roger?
Bitcoin is about masses, ideas &amp; trustlessness - not individuals. Satoshi!
@_date: 2017-10-04 21:29:09
You cannot learn much swimming with the stream all the time. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 07:58:40
I'm honest: I cannot predict future.
@_date: 2017-09-29 12:20:29
Yeah - show to little China how it works!
@_date: 2017-09-29 07:35:44
What color ? This has just changed some weeks ago ...
@_date: 2017-10-04 13:46:55
An easy transfer cheap fee market business !  What do you think they need 1x , 2x or Cash ?
@_date: 2017-09-28 10:25:05
Will you include Blockstream as well ? AFAIK this is also 'hidden' agenda / FIAT served corp?
Or in other words what do you think exponential growth is doing with bitcoin ?  Stopping at corps doors?
@_date: 2017-10-06 14:49:06
Will this hold e.g. for the 500k coinbase, bitpay, shapshift ... users as well? 
@_date: 2017-09-20 14:35:40
You cannot 'get rid' of core - you can only put core into more competition. Is that really that bad ?
@_date: 2017-09-25 16:54:08
And from that what we can see, we might expect to see some better takes soon :)
@_date: 2017-09-30 10:47:56
No, not that evil, but I would think of the side I was.
@_date: 2017-09-19 13:07:23
You cant afford the fees guys. Forget about.
@_date: 2017-09-22 11:15:07
Stop the ICO shit - it's bad for Bitcoin ecosystem and reputation!
@_date: 2017-09-21 12:10:52
Hmm. In an exp growth you can't be picky...
@_date: 2017-10-01 18:05:36
Is it also thinkable that some will join the NYA because of this noise and drama?
@_date: 2017-09-18 10:22:24
I'm happy it is not ruled by your language, but code and math :)
@_date: 2017-09-29 07:36:42
Try to send - happy settlement!
@_date: 2017-09-26 09:24:04
Best help I could give here: Contact Jonas Schnelli / core dev:
@_date: 2017-09-30 17:13:03
Yep. And if you wanna your TXs been processed (in the usual 10min) , you need to connect to the 2x nodes, or have I things wrong?
@_date: 2017-09-28 08:58:00
No - why stop ?  Any fears there? 
@_date: 2017-09-30 20:58:35
It might be that bitcoin trading could move to ord commodity exchanges. CME is close to do the same.
@_date: 2017-10-20 09:36:09
Against Bitcoin:  " A System that Authority cannot control" ??? This is the feature since anything centralized = authority can be hacked / compromised - the man doesn't get it finally....
@_date: 2017-09-21 08:40:16
To be really used by the poor (masses!) it needs to be cheap of usage costs - or it's centralized by high costs again.
Price stability / store of value comes with high usage / big volumes / closed economy &gt; low volatility.
@_date: 2017-10-31 12:56:00
If there is no single monopolist there will be no end!
@_date: 2017-09-18 09:27:35
I we extrapolate the hashpower to November than core will have about 10-15% from hashpower per today. Is this not more critical than the replay protection?  
@_date: 2017-09-29 13:50:20
And miners did not like the 1xSW - think of that as well.
@_date: 2017-09-18 11:43:13
They do - it's their risk and duty to keep customers.
@_date: 2017-10-02 07:24:26
How much fiat (converted to  $) does your Joe own ?
I'd say vast majority of these cannot afford even a  RaspPi and own connection / fees .  
They should rather buy little bitcoin on a SPV wallet!
Or do you think of rich average Joes only?  You know that these Joes are the one able to run (little) companies already ?
@_date: 2017-10-05 14:15:06
Nope - that's finally proven now ?  ;)
@_date: 2017-10-06 14:16:11
Yes - you got it. They are totally limited with people count, brain, b-size and money - they are already all-in with little bitcoin and a rasp pi - but we need ALL people on earth to get into.  
@_date: 2017-10-04 19:02:34
Again, he might be Satoshi or not. I don't care. Bitcoiners do not care about individuals and other 'proofs' beside a valid TX in the blockchain. So I still only listen to ideas, code and math. Thats my right to listen and CSW's to speak. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 14:07:06
Hahah - you again - guess the grey zone is best for us here.
@_date: 2017-09-09 16:02:18
Sh..t guess that's not what decentralization is about?
@_date: 2017-10-05 20:19:03
It takes a little to stay agnostic and a bunch of knowing logic. Esp logics our human brain is really capable of, not binary.
Anyway i have no issues to listen ideas and I m adult enough to detect real fraud. To compare CSW with a onecoin conman is far of logic and shows the bias. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 19:47:08
Yes, if it was only about fire more non-mining nodes, the NYA would have done it already. Such a node is a fraction of their total investments. NYA has all the top cards - if some nodes are needed, they'll just fire them.
@_date: 2017-10-05 20:01:37
Thanks for doin the right and adult thing here. GMax is totally biased and other core members as well. 
If they think CSW will talk the audience into 'some fraud', its to him to proof and outline what the result / harm might be.
@_date: 2017-10-05 10:27:08
ETH_ICO_Scammers have been there at same place and nobody got alerted - so we have some different measurements out there. OK - I do not care and hold to this comment:
@_date: 2017-10-04 18:27:58
Interesting comparison. Did CSW steal money? From you ? What was your damage?
@_date: 2017-10-05 20:32:05
Sure, holds true for the standard. Misses the black swan events completely and does not apply to a complex human env.
@_date: 2017-10-01 19:20:19
How about open competition?
@_date: 2017-10-02 12:19:24
No - I hear you and it sounds ideal - but this scenario cannot scale at all (internet of money!) .
Sorry - it's not realistic for broad masses (at least full nodes)  and we see it happening for years now that only a few afford this infrastructure costs.  And that's ok - or do you think we have already a big issue here?
@_date: 2017-10-05 20:38:55
Hehe, it always worked fine ( famos last words).
@_date: 2017-09-26 14:44:14
Got some Slovenian press here:
@_date: 2017-09-26 07:14:41
Mostly true.
But we see some hot spots where bitcoin is bootstrapping THIS:
@_date: 2017-10-04 18:00:12
Ehh, freedom of speech?
@_date: 2017-10-05 12:43:26
Hahaha - and our best advise for both would be: Grow up , learn sharing and play together  &gt; more fun. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 14:13:01
Hm - and to kill this in same moment he created this hoax proof. Not bad  - Satoshi would've done the same I'm sure. Leave us without him - sad but better. Bitcoin does not need individuals any more. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 05:40:15
@_date: 2017-10-02 07:27:03
Sorry, but I fear that this wont help much then - since your accounting node needs to have proper connections and needs to be important enough so. You're just adding a small solar at the border of a huge galaxy.
@_date: 2017-10-13 11:36:51
Was Peter Schiff ?
@_date: 2017-09-02 17:10:31
Sorry. Their taste just sucks. I once was asked to pay more for taste....? I just exited.
@_date: 2017-09-13 17:19:06
They banned (free) electricity instead?
@_date: 2017-10-05 19:57:51
Not a proof. Again try harder or give up to the grey zone jung boy.
@_date: 2017-10-05 20:39:25
This was the intention.
@_date: 2017-10-27 10:06:30
@_date: 2017-10-05 14:59:44
This is even more centralizing - you'll create more whales with that.
@_date: 2018-07-12 18:28:39
Lol, so they will also decide if ETH is a security or not or tomorrow similar?
@_date: 2017-10-02 07:30:33
So you say: If you cannot afford buy and trx bitcoin, buy &amp; run a node first?
And so save the btcs and trx of the rich Joes, that could afford ?
@_date: 2017-09-28 14:43:00
Umf - that's clear, because you cannot trade 'Blockchain' . Or did you already buy some BlockChainCoin ?  :)
@_date: 2017-10-06 06:13:11
No - you're also wrong. All profitable systems leads to centralization. Only Nash Equilibrium and operational risks work against this - no matter what religion you follow - Bitcoin has chosen the PoW - if you need sth else -&gt; alt coin section is your friend. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 08:29:30
Hm -- not so sure.
How many of your definition average Joes are already in Bitcoin, but not running any infrastructure?
I'd bet this is already majority - and things a running very good (thanks also to you and rest of core taking it that far ...) 
@_date: 2017-10-12 20:02:08
@_date: 2017-09-25 12:31:55
In the ideal bitcoin world there is no need to convert into / outoff fiat.

Thx a lot for clearing this up.

Yeah, esp if legacy bitcoin gets barely no hashpower?

So your bitcoin should be restricted to the developed world average Joes - poor and unbanked better stay on their poor fiat.
Thats not my bitcoin - sorry.

Yep - most people would just not notice, only the cheaper TX fee and faster settlement - no-brainer.

This guy is shilling desperately for his coin, so what...

Check what is listed and traded as well as accepted by a lot. Why is that fraud?
