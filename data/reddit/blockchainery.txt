Andreas is spot on, but I don’t share his enthusiasm about Bitcoin creating a better world. If hyperbitcoinization happens, it will mean the collapse of the current monetary system. I think what worries me more is that the world’s first trillionaires will be the hardcore libertarian cypherpunks - they will be the Rothschilds and Rockefellers but even richer and more powerful. That’s a scary future
@_date: 2019-07-31 15:09:36
Genuinely think you’ve got the right idea. We are in our first retest at the beginning of a clear bull market. If there is ever a time to mortgage your house for bitcoin, right now is about as low risk of a moment as there will be during this entire bull cycle. 
Funny thing is, there will be a lot more people mortgaging their houses for crypto. But they will be doing it during the mania phase in a few years, aka the actual worst time

How about insufficient transaction volume to support a fee-based incentive system to attract enough hashpower to keep a 51% attack implausible? That could be a big problem in just 20 years

It’s really amazing to see how he was not only aware of Bitcoin, but also fully understood the implications of Bitcoin... in Jan 2009.  He saw in that first month that this could snowball into a disruption of the entire banking system.
@_date: 2019-08-05 22:57:04
I have thought about it a lot. It actually terrifies me. Think about the types of people who were attracted to Bitcoin first - hardcore libertarian cypherpunks, with some far right ideologies about every man for himself and screw government. 
Then imagine if Bitcoin reaches the extreme hyperbitcoinization future and is pretty much the unit of account for all wealth on earth. Aka $100-300T scale. If Satoshi has 2M coins, he would be sitting on 10% of the world’s wealth. Aka $10-30T. Never in history would there be so much concentration of wealth on one person. And that’s just Satoshi, who may or may not ever touch those coins. Any cypherpunk with 10k BTC would be worth $30-100B. 
And if this is the beginning of the Bitcoin epoch of money, and 500 years from now it’s still all about Bitcoin... you’ve got an Altered Carbon situation
@_date: 2019-08-05 22:26:21
There are 1500 addresses with more than 1k BTC. If Bitcoin becomes the store of value for the digital future and reaches a market cap of $20T+... each of these wallets would be worth $1B+
There are 2,153 billionaires in the world according to Forbes. So that would mean nearly half of the world’s billionaires would now be from holding Bitcoin
The political power that a group united around holding Bitcoin would create would be jarring. It’s the preamble for a truly dystopian future like in Altered Carbon
@_date: 2019-08-05 22:44:24
The whole comment was to expand on the conjecture in the comment thread. If Bitcoin succeeds, it will mean that Bitcoin becomes at least digital gold and at maximum the unit of account for the world’s wealth. That means the lower bound would be $8T and the upper bound would be something like $100T. I never said it would be a walk in the park, and I never said it is going to happen. Just was adding to the prior commenters’ points that IF bitcoin succeeds in its aim... it would mean a huge portion of the world’s most wealthy would be wealthy because of early stakes in Bitcoin

Good link, I remember reading this a few months ago. Mostly focused on debunking de Vries coal power claims, which all makes sense. However, the author doesn’t give any nod to the opportunity cost of all that hydro power, whether now or in the future. That article is also where I’m sourcing my bemusement that Bitcoin’s energy consumption is 80% renewable, so therefore 20% fossil fuel, which means Bitcoin is still using as much energy as Sri Lanka from fossil fuels. I also think his hand wavey argument about how energy consumption not being tied to Bitcoin prices only holds up on short time scales - if Bitcoin is $100k after the halvening, you can bet there will be 5x more mining activity as the profitability of participating will attract more hashpower until profitability drops to roughly what it is today.

Top 40 puts it right among Chile or Czech Republic. That’s not a small amount. And if block rewards keep outpacing the halving, that will grow. 
And look at my comments elsewhere on this thread. If 20% of energy is coming from fossil fuels, that still means burning as much as Sri Lanka in fossil fuels alone. 
That’s not GOOD for the environment
And my original point was: it would be great to have deflationary store of value without PoW energy waste. Hopefully an alternative consensus mechanism proves itself viable

Thanks for the very informed response.  Perhaps you know a bit about this other question I've been having...
Am I correct in thinking that blocks are currently ~90% full?  I know that block sizes are averaging just over 1Mb with witness data, but the non-witness data is nearing 1Mb.  For example, this chart: 
Is that a correct interpretation?  I read somewhere that Segwit could theoretically mean 3.7Mb of data, yet blocks are nearly full right now at just over 1Mb?  I feel like I'm missing something that explains the theoretical potential vs the much lower actual numbers at the moment
@_date: 2019-06-28 18:56:43
I’m telling you I spent hundreds of hours calculating solar production trends for a work project. And Bitcoin driving down solar costs 5% would be ridiculously high. More like 0.1% if that
And your 7 million households getting solar thing got completely lost from the original facts. I’m saying that 20% of bitcoin energy is fossil fuel sourced. 20% of bitcoin energy consumption equals the consumption of Sri Lanka. Not at all saying that a population the size of Sri Lanka would be getting solar...
Do you see how absurdly off track you got with your argument? Wasting my time
@_date: 2019-06-11 16:14:23
Dang, that is some Altered Carbon level of sci-fi. Question: in this future, how much Bitcoin makes a person equivalent to a $100M net worth person today? Or maybe it’s easier to ask, what’s the end state total valuation of Bitcoin in today’s dollars? $100T?

Thanks to both of you for the informed and helpful responses. Nothing says bear market quite like being able to get technical questions actually answered on reddit. u/edmundedgar
Do either of you think that based on historical patterns of volume increasing to support the next bull cycle ( that Bitcoin is likely to run into full blocks and escalating transaction fees? It feels like LN won’t quite be ready to take meaningful volume off chain
(Full disclosure: Nano is one of my positions because I think congestion next market cycle will drive interest in alternatives again. Bitcoin no doubt wins of course, once L2 solutions work themselves out better)

How much will Schnorr signatures increase capacity?  Can you point me anywhere to read more about that?

@_date: 2019-06-11 05:32:30
Yup fully agree with that vision of the future economy, with the disintermediation of trust institutions and the data rich automation of all sorts of transactions, big and small. And ya, sounds like more of an Ethereum-oriented future than a Bitcoin one. I know that Bitcoin has smart contract capabilities built in, and financial products like the ad-tech solution you mentioned could theoretically be built on Bitcoin... but would obviously have to be on L2 technology and it seems like Ethereum is more or less purpose built for it 
Either way it’s going to be a damn exciting decade

Claiming that burning as much energy as the 40th largest energy consuming country in the world and claiming that this is a net benefit to the world because part of that consumption stimulates the solar industry requires the high burden of proof, not the other way around

So you are also interpreting it as “crypto/blockchain” rather than just Bitcoin being what everything is built on? But I thought Andreas’ thing was advocating that Bitcoin will be where allll the value is?
@_date: 2019-06-11 03:52:31
Andreas is ridiculously smart and well informed.. so can someone explain to me what I’m missing here? Bitcoin the currency is email, and the “internet of money” is all of the applications besides just currency that have yet to come. 
That part I get, but it sounds like exactly what Ethereum fanboys would say. I know Andreas thinks all the applications and value will be on Bitcoin, but I don’t see nearly as much development and new applications taking shape on Bitcoin as on Ethereum. Makes it seem like crypto is the internet of money and Bitcoin (the store of value for the space) is just email. 
What am I missing?
@_date: 2019-06-11 16:00:58
Sorry, could you expand on that POV?  Some of the other responses provided more thorough explanations effectively saying "he's talking about public blockchains, not Bitcoin exlusively" and those seem to logically fit a bit better with what Andreas literally said.  
But I'm trying to understand the alternative POV, could you help by explaining a bit more why he means Bitcoin and not any other blockchain?  Andreas did write the book on Ethereum after all..
@_date: 2019-06-11 04:54:06
Oh gosh you’re right I somehow forgot about that. All of his speaking engagements (or at least all the ones that get posted here and on Twitter) are about Bitcoin. Thanks for the reminder!
@_date: 2019-02-13 05:13:31
Haha I am actually a Nano supporter. I just think Bitcoin most likely wins out despite its short comings. 
But Litecoin definitely doesn’t have any merit. Not big enough improvements over Bitcoin to outweigh all of disadvantages of not being Bitcoin (the most hashpower = 51% attack very infeasible, bigger community, more brand recognition)
@_date: 2019-06-28 06:30:07
Lol this comment detracted from your original point. My previous point said I doubt the direct stimulus to the solar industry offsets the fossil fuel also consumed by bitcoin mining elsewhere in the world, that includes the rate of improvement to solar unit economics that might make solar more mainstream sooner. 
My first job in corporate America was researching solar and projecting unit economics into the future. That was 12 years ago now

Interesting, haven’t heard about LApps at all yet. Will research them! Any resources you recommend?
@_date: 2019-06-11 15:55:21
Ah yes, this comes back to two questions: 1) is POS a viable alternative to POW?  and 2) does every application require best-in-class security at the expense of high on-chain fees?
Of course Bitcoin is the most secure chain, but I see POS as theoretically viable, so I think an archipelago of almost-as-safe POS alternatives to Bitcoin's security being sufficient or even preferable to Bitcoin in some cases.  (For example, I closely follow Nano's development, and it seems they really have found a viable design for feeless, near-instant value transfer... it just has to prove itself from a security POV and then it makes more sense to build a microtransaction or arbitrage product on Nano's network than Bitcoin's)
@_date: 2019-06-11 16:33:00
Ya this thread is jaw droppingly divorced of reality.  This makes me think that a lot of the people who buy in to the Bitcoin-takes-over-the-world dogma are young dreamers who envision remaking the world in the image of some sci fi alternate universe.
The real world is messy, and Western liberal democracy relies on foundational principles of access to all, rather than some merciless pay-or-suffer system.  That is a more dangerous idea than anything in modern history - even communism and nazism promoted the benefit of the people.  A purely pay-or-suffer system would be unthinkably callous and cruel, more in line with feudalism or even Reconstruction era sharecropping
The fact that so many of the disciples of this extreme Bitcoin maximalism seem to have not considered how untenably inhumane the system would be undercuts the value of their entire line of thinking
@_date: 2019-06-11 05:53:58
I guess this is the crux of what I still don’t understand (after thousands of hours of research in crypto). To me, it seems inevitable that an interconnected archipelago of crypto networks with differing strengths tailored to particular use cases will collectively be the “internet of money”. As in, the network in the internet of money will be the archipelago of quality coins serving real use cases better than others can. 
I understand the alternative view that Bitcoin is the singular ledger upon which all solutions will be built, and any competing platforms will eventually be marginalized and eventually rendered impotent. 
With APIs and blockchain interoperability, the former seems so much more plausible to me
@_date: 2019-06-28 22:20:22
@_date: 2019-06-11 16:04:21
Ya that makes sense - maybe it's my awareness of these additional layers that is lacking.  I'm aware of Lightning and the potential for other L2 structures designed to net out a lot of activity into just a few onchain settlements.  I'm aware of Liquid and other sidechain concepts to effectively do the same.
What are the other layers that are being built on L2 or beyond that I should research?
@_date: 2019-06-28 05:52:40
I’ve heard the arguments about how Bitcoin is mostly green energy sources, but that ignores the opportunity cost of that energy source. What’s the highest and best use of that energy now? In the future?
And the idea that bitcoin directly stimulates the solar industry enough to offset the waste of non-green energy bitcoin mining is just not realistic
@_date: 2019-06-28 20:24:34
“If that 20% equals srilanka that means that if Bitcoin add that many years for that many buildings changing over from fossil fuels to solar, that'd mean they met it.”

@_date: 2019-06-28 03:51:22

I’m saying the burden of proof is on your claim that solar benefits from Bitcoin in excess of the 20% fossil fuel cost to the world. You’ve claimed it is better for the world, but the burden of proof is clearly on your claim

@_date: 2019-06-28 16:37:16
Ah, now you have strayed into my world of business, Econ, and strategy. So I can say with confidence that yes, it does work that way. 
I think you mean to say that Bitcoin doesn’t need any more hashpower in order to stay secure, which is true. What I’m saying though is if the expected value of a block reward goes up, the amount of energy consumption will go up commensurately. Let’s say Bitcoin price is $100k in a few years, meaning block reward is 5x after the halvening. 
Let’s assume mining currently has ~25% profit margins today (which would make it a fantastically attractive industry already). After the halving and Bitcoin at $100k, these same miners expending the same costs would be reaping 500% revenue. Suddenly their profit margins are 1-75/500 =85%. You’re making a dollar for every 15cents you put in. 
The key is that there are no barriers to entry for new competitors to come into the system. An avalanche of new entrants would come into the space until collective mining industry costs roughly 5xed such that people were spending 400% as much as original on costs in order to compete for that 500% of original revenue. Profit margins would again be 25%
@_date: 2019-02-13 04:59:24
Lol it must be very annoying for Bitcoin advocates to see altcoin owners emptily shilling in the Bitcoin sub. No wonder they dislike us
@_date: 2019-02-13 04:32:57
Yup I understand how it works.  My question is how the congestion of 2017 (long waits, high fees, uncertainty about when your transaction would show up) will be avoided in the future. 
But instead of how it will be avoided, I’m getting answers about how it’s a reality of Bitcoin’s design.  Which I know. 
That worries me that Bitcoin doesn’t have a long term solution to the usability gap between Bitcoin and some of the newer altcoins. Unless Lightning Network actually can turn into the dreamed-of endstate. But that seems uncertain so far
@_date: 2019-06-11 16:45:00
Damn, you really eviscerated that dude's line of thinking and he didn't even realize how much he painted himself into a completely insane corner.  Pure libertarian Bitcoin future dreamworld is the most dystopian reality imaginable.  
Based on distribution of Bitcoin today, that entire world would be dominated by ~140,000 people who own 10 or more Bitcoin.  Then there would be ~2.5M people with 0.1-10 Bitcoin.  Then there would be 7,000M people with essentially zero wealth who would be desperately trying to survive and have no money to pay for essential services and would sell themselves into servitude.  
Fucking bananas crazy
@_date: 2019-06-11 15:57:14
Dang, I'm a huge believer in blockchain but that is next level.  You believe the world will fundamentally re-orient itself around who owns Bitcoin?  I can't imagine the world pandering to owners of an asset any more than it does today to people who own gold or real estate, for instance
@_date: 2019-06-11 16:11:03
That's a great synthesis of the ideologically pure Bitcoin maximalist POV.  And logically it does make sense to me.  However, it seems a little at odds with what I see going on in the cryptosphere today.
For example, it seems to me that there are more large companies building products and features on Ethereum than on Bitcoin.  Play that trend forward into the future and I can see a world where a lot of blockchain apps are built on Ethereum or protocols besides Bitcoin.  At the end of the day, Bitcoin would likely continue to be the all-important store of value just as it is today... but use cases that have found a home on Eth would be priced in Eth, and so on (just like it is today).
The "Bitcoin eats all other protocols' positioning" seems at odds with the current trajectory of development in the space.  Bitcoin remaining the most important use case (store of value / digital gold) seems almost certain, however.
@_date: 2019-06-11 16:36:24

I'm worried that it causes a usability problem during the prime time of a bull market and many newcomers will have reason to believe Eth or Nano or others are actually improvements on Bitcoin
Would be awesome if BTC had no congestion issues and LN was super easy in terms for less tech savvy people to use, but that doesn't look like it will be the case this bull run
@_date: 2019-05-18 16:27:42
Interesting perspective. I think Bitcoin wins out as the store of value for the digital age, which is by far the most valuable bucket. But I think there will be an ecosystem of other coins for other use cases that will be running in the background. Like if a service requires absolute privacy, it will connect Bitcoin to Monero (or whatever wins there). Fastest value transfer (for arbitrage) might use Nano (if L2 bitcoin solutions don’t improve to be as unconstrained), etc
Will be interesting to watch it all evolve into backend technology and see what project(s) win
@_date: 2019-05-18 18:47:19
Lol I am a Nano fan, but I was specifically phrasing things in terms of “something with no fees and high speed” to highlight that Bitcoin does have shortcomings in that one respect. 
I agree with you that Bitcoin almost certainly becomes the store of value of the digital age and the unit of account. But it’s myopic to assume that since it carries these most important categories, its properties are sufficient for all currency use cases. 
Which is to say I am also a Bitcoin maximalist in the intellectual sense, but not dogmatic in that stance as I have accepted there are areas in which Bitcoin will be supplemented by other projects. You’ll get there
@_date: 2019-05-15 19:34:13
Oh cool, hadn't seen that outputs site before.  And yes, Segwit and batching has clearly helped a lot, no doubt about it.  And LN will also help - but not for a couple years it seems.  So what I'm worried about is that current mempool looks like it did ~start of 2017.  But this time, we've only just begun a new bull market... and transaction volumes will grow a lot more still  
@_date: 2019-05-15 19:34:44
Haha true, BTC congestion is highly correlated with massive gains... so if you think about it that way it's a good thing
@_date: 2019-05-18 17:10:42
Security parameters that are part of Bitcoin being the best store of value, absolutely. 
Nano is unproven as a safe store of value, and has its challenges, but it is unequivocally better at non-mission-critical transactions. Projecting into the future, even if Nano fails for some reason, some feeless and near-instant technology will present an interesting competitive threat to BTC purely in the medium of exchange use case
@_date: 2019-05-15 19:37:03
Well, looking at the pattern over the last 3 months 
It looks like the April 1 spike caused the mempool to fill.  It also seems that the recent parabolic rally has caused mempool to fill.  Seems to line up with renewed interest in Bitcoin... which suggests that it's organic and not a spam attack.  Also suggests that congestion will only get worse as BTC transaction volume increases over the bull market
@_date: 2019-05-18 19:57:52
Dodging the content of my comment
@_date: 2019-05-15 23:00:01
Ya I agree that the following bull run will likely be manageable with offchain solutions.  But the next 1-2 years will be an issue.  And important distinction that if BTC is more mainstream and reaches more people this bull run than last run, there will be more transactions than last time.  Many more.  And Segwit/batching has evidently not been enough because we are already at 93% full blocks and mempool filling up during the day and clearing at night 
@_date: 2019-05-15 19:09:08
Serious question:  Are you guys not concerned with the mempool already starting to grow?  A full-fledged bull market will drive up BTC transaction volume and we will be back to Dec 2017 conditions pretty soon 
I know scaling has happened and helps a lot, but I'm worried it's not going to be enough.  Any homie able to soothe my worries?
@_date: 2019-05-19 05:23:43
Excellent chart thanks for posting! 
Good old McKinsey. The flimsiness of the assumptions behind those numbers would surprise you
@_date: 2019-05-15 19:39:20
I guess that's part of what worries me.  LN will be a lot less reasonable if it costs $100 for an on-chain transaction to open a channel.  As in, not many people in the world will be willing to pay that... which is what we're heading to if fees climb like last bull run
@_date: 2019-05-19 02:22:35
Ya I’ve yet to get a decent answer because dogmatic maximalists refuse to acknowledge that other projects might have some functionality that Bitcoin doesn’t offer
@_date: 2019-05-14 00:59:53
It disappeared along with Bitcoin fees. So long as feed and congestion aren’t a problem on Bitcoin again, we will never have to worry about Nano rising up again
@_date: 2019-05-19 03:13:52
Um, you’re equating stakeholders in POS to intermediaries in the conventional financial system? Can’t tell if don’t know anything about how business works or have an incomplete understanding of POS. Either way, I’m increasingly assured that I’m not the less informed party
@_date: 2019-05-18 07:20:23
Are there any pure currency altcoins that you’re interested in? What do you think about Nano? I can’t tell if it’s compelling or just a new spin on the same old shitcoin concept
@_date: 2019-05-18 16:50:28
Yup def agree on unit of account. And ya it is the dominant medium of exchange but that’s where its design constraints leave it open to competitive threat. For example, limited block space means even just having to open LN channels will always involve a significant fee onchain. That’s the only area where I see Bitcoin eventually ceding market share to other currencies over time (Nano or the like)
But again, medium of exchange is much less valuable than store of value / unit of account
@_date: 2019-05-15 20:58:09
Didn’t know that about coinbase. But presumably they are batching right now. So if the mempool is already filling.. that won’t help us reduce it this time
@_date: 2019-05-19 00:32:03
That’s fair, text and especially random reddit dialogue is less conducive to rich debate. And I genuinely wonder if I underappreciate LN, or have in some way misunderstood its constraints or lack thereof. Do you happen to have any resources you would recommend reading about it? I’ve done quite a bit of research but certainly could be missing something 
I guess what it comes back to is that I believe I have done an above average amount of research about LN and see some structural limitations (opening and closing channels with onchain transactions; necessitating fees, however small). In parallel, I’ve tried to kick the shit out of the tires of dPOS block lattice and haven’t been able to disprove that its model is not superior for non-mission-critical value transfer. Hence, I’m in a place of believing there’s considerable potential to Nano whilst simultaneously believing that BTC has cemented itself as the irrefutable kind in everything except non-mission-critical value transfer. So I’m on this weird limbo of believing that BTC is and will remain king, yet Nano is massively undervalued
I should probably also mention I’ve been in this market quite a few years. I felt similarly about Eth at $13 (based on a different set of reasons why Eth might service white space that BTC didn’t sufficiently cover)
@_date: 2019-05-15 20:41:37
I believe the average fee at the peak was around that much.  If BTC is 5x as valuable this bull market, and congestion starts earlier in the bull market (last time it was only the last couple months.. not 1+ years)... seems like this bull market we are likely to have $100 fees
@_date: 2019-05-26 03:00:52

Interesting, you actually think Venmo is equivalent. Venmo isn’t free. That entire business is underwritten by PayPal shareholders as they push for market share dominance in their growth phase. Eventually fees will be added in order to make the business profitable. That’s what PayPal has communicated to the street
@_date: 2019-05-15 21:01:21
BCH is ridiculous. The tribe has spoken, small blocks win. 
But the mempool issue does crack the door open for other transaction oriented currencies, like Nano. And alternative exchange pairs like Eth (when moving between exchanges)
