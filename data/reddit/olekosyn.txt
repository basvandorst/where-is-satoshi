Banking elite *is* the state there.

And this is how I know he either is incompetent with crypto or aims to mislead the readers. Bitcoin is a currency, designed to be used for purchasing, traded and not hoarded in cold storages. Mindsets like these is what we have to thank for high fees.

Hello, I am Mr. Ver's persanal psychotherapist and I'd like to ask you as a medical proffesional to talk more about my client. My equipment deep within his body has detected elevated endorphin levels in his bloodstream and undulatory motions of his gluteus maximus correlating with him reading posts about his humble self on Reddit, which is characteristic of happiness. Needless to say, Mr. Ver has been feeling down lately (since January, to be precise), so this endorphin boost is something he sorely needs to alleviate the depression.
So I'd like to ask you to make more posts about my client, especially good-natured and congratulatory ones. Failure to do so will be counted as attempted personal injury and thus reported to the Internet police *and* the state police. Consequences will never be the same. Nazi moderator bot who closed my original post has been reported to the President himself, whose assistant has promised to take appropriate measures.
With respect,
Dr. Aaron Jerkin

Nothing stops those contributors from making their own Bitcoin fork the way they want it to be.

I just checked his Twitter to see how he's doing, turns out he's shilling for some noname ICO now.

Did you try to get your bank to do a chargeback?

No, just dozens of butthurt threads on Tarkov forums/subs.

There's more than one cryptocurrency in existence.

XSolla is fukken terrible. Not only they're nickel-and-diming customers, they try to scam them too with hidden fees and, I shit you not, hidden tips.
That's what happens in an uncompetitive market.

Others are much easier to mine than Bitcoin. Even GPU miners can mine altcoins.

LOL no, prepare for drop to 800$ and subsequent passenger disembarkation. Sell everything you have while you still can!

That would be the absolute best thing for Bitcoin. 
Speculators, hoarders and corporations that are attracted to BTC's high value get kicked off the rollercoaster, and actual tech enthusiasts keep using it, enjoying vastly improved confirmation times and lower fees (and thus better liquidity). Like a forest fire, a Bitcoin crash is a natural part of its cycle that constitutes an important factor in its antifragility.

Too bad it is.

Crashes are still needed from time to time in order to keep expectations in line with reality. Dot-com bubble didn't kill the Internet, it pruned it and destroyed those companies that were unsustainable or vulnerable. Same with BTC crashes - it ruins complacent investors, while warier investors minimize their risks before the crash and buy low afterwards. Tremendous overvaluation of Bitcoin, or anything for that matter, *will* result in equally tremendous pushback that Bitcoin might not survive.

Gold is backed by its resistance to corrosion, aesthetic and conductive qualities. It is hilariously overpriced, but is quite useful.

Yeah, how important is it, anyway? It's not like anyone knowing your medical data would sell it to pharmaceutical corporations or, say, banks. I mean, so what if a bank offers predatory loans to desperate people that it knows enough about to manipulate?

Satoshi Nakamoto is an ex-NSA agent known as John Reese. He doesn't have a known Reddit account, but there's a documentary show about him, "Interesting Person" or something like this.
