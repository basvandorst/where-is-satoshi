No way. The source is full of BS.

Those who completely sell out are already factored in the 75% who don't hold bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-03-29 04:55:47
You forgot how they socialize the hack instead of taking money from their profits immediately to pay people. 
@_date: 2019-11-02 02:29:59
Please make sure you message me. It will be interesting to see you ideas formalized. I can help with critical appraisal.
@_date: 2019-11-02 02:33:24
It can be expressed in different ways. I think you are taking it one step too far. I'd say e\^(t\*rate) is all you need
@_date: 2019-11-16 03:22:23
This is kinda retarded. Since when do we have to report anything but sales. This standard does not apply to any other thing.
@_date: 2019-11-04 22:24:03
Time to dig deep. Looks interesting at first glance.

This has nothing to do with Bitcoin and everything to do with selling drugs to an undercover agent... It's like blaming a car dealer if someone is a car to traffic drugs or do some other shady things.

show me the link to goldman's own site or its just fake news.

That's it? I hold since 2007

Where did you get the data from?
@_date: 2019-10-07 20:26:29
I take them at their word. It is definitely not automated as a human has to check the documents they ask you to upload. Also their KYC procedures maybe different in different regions.

I offered a link in my original response. Feel free to provide supporting evidence for your statement.
@_date: 2019-10-05 21:31:56
WRONG:  kraken does support ACH deposits in USA.

You need professional help.
@_date: 2019-10-19 03:53:32
I think you misread or misunderstood the whole post. It is about transmission of value. Nothing about "taking over" or replacement.
@_date: 2019-10-11 22:34:33
Contact support. I managed to deposit already.

Does each contract represent one btc?

Discussion is not about us. It's about Facebook
@_date: 2019-10-19 08:44:48
As I mentioned: off chain, immediate conversation to Fiat, current regulation. Also surveillance won't be affected.
@_date: 2019-10-19 08:48:28
Price stability can be easily fixed by automatic conversation to Fiat upon sending. The Time it takes to convert and send them receive and convert can be a fraction of second
@_date: 2019-10-08 18:39:23
They do take ACH for deposits but not for withdrawals. For people who don't want to sell that is not an issue.
@_date: 2019-10-25 16:03:15
I highly doubt the reliability of the info you provided...
@_date: 2019-10-19 19:14:15
You missed the part about "off chain".
@_date: 2019-10-12 17:22:44
poor terminology on their part. I spend hours trying to figure that out with Kraken support. The ACH info is the same as US domestic wire. The only problem is that it is a deposit only account. You can't withdraw USD via ACH. So yeah an idiot designed that part of the site and it is costing them millions just because they can't make it clear.

I don't fully understand this stand-alone graph. Someone should write a paper about this. I'd really be interested in it.
@_date: 2019-06-22 15:33:22
Garbage in, garbage out. If you ask a stupid question you get a stupid answer. It's basic computer science.
@_date: 2019-06-06 02:06:25
The article really doesn't provide any supporting details, nor explains why those companies are better off in Switzerland than elsewhere. I'm unsatisfied with the article. Why is Switzerland better than British Virgin islands, Canada, or Malta??
@_date: 2019-10-08 03:45:23
To me this is evidence that we are still extremely early adopters.
@_date: 2019-04-03 21:04:24
It's true but it is saying bitcoin is trending...

If bigger blocks increase the fees we should reduce the size to 0.5 to reduce the fees. /S... Do you realize your assertion is completely wrong to a point that no expert on neither side of debate would agree with it. I'm disappointed that it's wrong info like this gets upvoted to this level.

Don't think you understood what this post is about. It's about someone requesting Bitcoin as a gift. It's not about giving Bitcoin to someone who doesn't want Bitcoin.

Any hack, even if does not affect us personally, does affect the community and as a result all of us. This sucks.
