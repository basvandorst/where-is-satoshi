Yeah, it's not a "overnight we'll see" thing - more an adoption over time + how does network respond to that thing.

I think the point is more "such high fees are never acceptable. It's cool that it's low now but why wasn't it so low last week?". Supply and demand perhaps explains but does not excuse high tx fees.

I wasn't trying to debate in favor of or against LN...?
This is a really strong statement to make, because scalability is defined by hardware, network throughput, etc - what was viable scalability-wise in the 80's is very different than what's viable scalability-wise today, and so a decision on "what's best for bitcoin" today might not be best for tomorrow, etc. 
In any case, chucking small txs onto LN is where it seems to shine to me, and the question I have is "does efficiently solving that 90% use-case lower the effective overhead to the point that it is incredibly worth it for users and "is there a significant tradeoff in centralization and is that worth it".

Why is this being downvoted? lol.
Licensing IS a big part of open-source software. Software licensing is pretty complicated and always something you have to consider. Hell, just because something's on Github doesn't mean you have the right to use it, even if you're open sourcing your own code. For example, if there's GPLv3 code, you can't just take that and plug it into your MIT/BSD-licensed code - that's a violation of their license. 
And to be clear, if I don't stick a license on my code and publish it online, you don't have the right to use it because I haven't granted you the right to use it. That's just fact.
Pretty sick of the open-source software circlejerk. I believe in it and have released FOSS libraries in the past, but that comes with tradeoffs. GPLv3 -&gt; Proprietary has always been a thing to be aware of, if you're going to complain just fork the damn project (from a branch pre-fuck-up) and take it in a proper direction, rather than whining about the code-hosting service.

It's a good summary of what they do, though Github wants to move beyond hosting just open source software - they think they're building a tool that could be leveraged for more.
And as a technicality, if I post code on Github or Google Code without a license, then you don't have the right to use my code, even if you can see it (unless their TOS makes you grant a default license otherwise).

Agreed - I think they should be pursuing damage control here. Other than trust with a community I can't see how their $19 product stands out from cheap ripoffs that are inevitably going to pop up, assuming the hardware blueprints / software are still all out there.
Either way, they're just not handling this properly. Switching from lpglv3 to shared source is a slap in the fact (and possibly a licensing violation if others have contributed code). Either way, they shouldn't be revoking access to previous code by rewriting the last 6 months of history to include a licensing change. 
Seems like a terrible way to build trust with a community of magical internet money users.

Yeah, but software development shouldn't be a popularity contest. Acking from people who probably mostly don't understand the original reasoning is meaningless.

As a software engineer that doesn't use Bitcoin, your comment confuses me. Why would you prefer a homogeneous pool of bitcoin clients if that means the network going from 100 to 0 if an exploit is found, rather than a heterogeneous pool that goes from 100 to 80 if an exploit is found in one implementation?
Frankly you come across as ranting rather than rational.
@_date: 2017-03-15 09:21:38
I think that still argues in favor of a diverse mix of clients. The incompetency of the codebase's engineers (which you're basing your argument off of) is another topic of discussion that is more of a strawman. 
When you have a diverse mixture of clients, a bug in one client that doesn't exist in other clients should mean the buggy client being rejected by the quorum. If you had Bitcoin node implementations A, B, and C with equal network shares, you'd be resilient from failure from one of A, B, and C, assuming the problem (such as this trivial error in this post) isn't present in other implementations.
That's sort of foundational to distributed systems. It's related to why it was okay for there to be multiple clients for early file-sharing networks, and so forth.

Listening to both sides as valid is a good alternative...

Lucky you, they only scratched their heads and called their supervisors when I tried :P

I just got trolled into believing my hodling had paid off.

The number is probably rounded. 22/47 would be close, for example.
