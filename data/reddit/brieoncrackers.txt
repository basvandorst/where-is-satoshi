Wow, I just cut myself on this edge.
Anarchists are petulant children who don't realize that one of the very important reasons our species is so ridiculously successful for a species of mammal is our complex social structures, and yes, that includes government.

Apple gets to decide what legally binding conditions apply to applications in their store. No "right" or "wrong" about it. It's their ball, they can take it and go home if they want. There're being consistent, and that means they aren't being unfair. Maybe consistently dickish, but as previously stated, not unfair.

Someone isn't pro-government just because they aren't as wildly and ignorantly anti-government as a fucking anarchist.

If the major economies will not accept bitcoin, major economies regulated by governments, by the way, the strength of bitcoin, its usefulness and desirability as a currency with be drastically limited. Were one or two countries to reject bitcoin (say China and the US) bitcoin would drop precipitously in value, as we have seen when there were rumors that China would outlaw them.

If the entire earth were made of gold, gold would still be finite. The entire earth is not made of gold, in fact gold makes up a tiny fraction of the mass of the earth, therefore we can safely assume that the mass of all the gold on earth is a finite number smaller than the mass of the earth.

You said gold was infinite. I was just pointing out that it is simply not.  Not saying anything about bit coins, but even if you were to rearrange all the subatomic particles in the universe to make the maximum amount of gold, it would still be a finite amount of gold. Simply stated, there IS a maximum amount of gold, if the university is as we currently understand it to be.

I don't know, but it is necessarily a smaller finite number than the finite number of atoms in the universe. Infinity cannot be smaller than a finite number by definition.

If I have a 1'x 1' box that is empty, and I put one marble in it, do I suddenly have more marbles when I enlarge the box to 2'x2'? 
In this analogy, empty space is represented by the box, and atoms are represented by the marble.
