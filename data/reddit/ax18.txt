I was using magnr up till today. 2.35% interest isn't enough to risk a hack. Sad :( I love the idea of making interest on my bitcoin holdings.

I have always liked Dave grew up listening to his radio show and it taught me how to live below my means and save. I think he was completely right when he said this 2 years ago. I hope he would agree that he is a little less right today. Every day bitcoin does not die it inches closer to a stable currency that he could one day recommend.
@_date: 2016-08-01 22:22:15
Eh developers developing bitcoin is still good even if its a minority group. Even if they dont come up with any good ideas no harm done.

You are right that a blockchain probably needs a native token. Nothing says that has to be bitcoin. I also hope that bitcoin is adopted and is the best solution but there is no guarantee of that. 
@_date: 2016-08-01 22:34:07
Why would you dismiss someone who is doing their best to improve the protocol we all rely on and hope will become widely adopted?

Last 3 Days in San Diego this talk was last night. 
@_date: 2015-12-28 23:41:29
There is a local bar in Downtown San Diego about 8 mins walk from my house called Downtown Johnny Browns that I go to whenever possible. They accept bitcoin but it gets used so infrequently they didnt really know how to do it until I started frequenting there a few months ago. I know where they keep their phone now and have taught 3 different employees how to use it. I bring any of my friends that show interest in bitcoin there for a beer while I explain it to them. Then I either pay for the beers with bitcoin or offer to pay my friend in bitcoin if they will cover the tab. 
There is also a taco shop in SD called City Tacos I like. The owner also accepts bitcoin at his other restaurant but I have not been yet. 
Im also a religious user of purse.io (did all my christmas shopping with them) 
Use foldapp whenever i go to starbucks.
Always check if cardcash has a good discount for giftcards when i want to make a purchase. (extra 2% off for using bitcoin)
I used to use movietickets.com but now i use cardcash and buy a theather giftcard so i can get a discount. 
I make bet's with my little brother in bitcoin who lives 5 hours away.
I am attracted to bitcoin for its philosophy and its technology. I'm all in and I always buy twice the amount of bitcoin that I spend. 
@_date: 2015-12-18 17:24:14
I found this to. Had to scroll about 5 pages down but its there. Do you think they are only targeting towards bitcoin users? There is other content that tells you its targeted but that dosent mean its only targted if it says it is. 
@_date: 2015-12-30 19:36:33
Nice! bitcoin services are getting closer and closer to being useful and easy enough for mass adoption every day.

You can't go wrong with either one of them. Don't forget to keep learning though and eventually hold your coins in your own control.
@_date: 2015-12-29 05:00:09
Of course. Hit up the airbitz app directory. They are based here in SD and they keep it really up to dated especially for this area. See you around at downtown Johnny browns I'll be the one paying in bitcoin :)

Seconded what are you talking about? I've been buying Christmas presents at a discount all month.
@_date: 2015-12-18 17:22:21
Coinbase and Circle are the easiest for buying in my experience. Many people would suggest you then move that bitcoin to somewhere where you control the private keys. 
@_date: 2015-12-30 19:28:29
That thing looks a lot more legit then the ones i've seen. Glad that these things are getting better and better.

Me too and i was quite unhappy about it. How on earth can i not do this online! 
@_date: 2014-01-23 21:40:16
Not sure what the principle is called but i have heard someone talk about the tendency to spend the currency they feel is less valuable and hold the one that is more valuable. This is how i feel every time i see a post like this. Great i love Bitcoin! but id rather save mine and get rid of dollars.. 
@_date: 2016-01-04 07:10:51
I don't know anything but is it possible bitcoin exchanges are limited as well? 
@_date: 2016-03-03 23:35:11
I may actually not be thinking of green addresses. What I am curious about is a 2 of 3 contract. One key being a time lock transaction that the user would be able to regain their funds if something went wrong. Another key for the user to control and another key for the green address provider to control. 
So you would lock up funds that you wanted to spend through the green address provider with the 3 keys. When you wanted to spend something you would sign the transaction and you would ask the green address provider to sign the transaction. The merchant can trust the zero confirmation transaction because it trusts the green address provider to not double spend and you cannot double spend without their help. 
In the event the green address provider acts badly you only have to wait for the time lock to retrieve your funds. 
I know it introduces centralization but it seems pretty safe and useful. 
@_date: 2015-01-20 22:18:02

@_date: 2016-01-05 22:11:33
Yeah thankfully we use amazon pretty often. (usually with purse) so it wont be hard to find a use for it.  In general i think that giftcards should die in a fire ;) 
@_date: 2016-01-26 02:43:53
Good catch btw I was praising Coinbase earlier but you deserve some credit as well. A very reasonable and productive interaction all around. 
@_date: 2016-01-06 09:18:32
This argument never made sense to me. If we have any kind of emp event powerful enough to destroy bitcoin were fucked on a whole different level. On top of that it's possible to shield things from emp and I wouldn't be surprised if there were already a few nodes that are shielded and if it grows there will deffiantly be shilded nodes. 
@_date: 2016-03-15 02:20:40

They gave all 4 of us 500 dollar amazon gift cards for Christmas so we wanted to return the favor. They have shown interest in bitcoin so its not 
out of the blue but neither of them have ever owned any. Figured I would take the risk of getting yelled at for posting an address to see if I could get some more donations for really good  bosses and explain how they got some extra money. 
@_date: 2016-01-25 21:29:39
I'm very impressed with Coinbase. I my self have never had an issue with them and anytime I see them in conflict with anyone they always appear to be extremely reasonable.  I think the reputation they are building as a legitimate and competent organization is a huge service to the bitcoin community 
@_date: 2016-01-18 08:46:13
It would certainly be good if we had more decentralization in mining that would be the best way to prevent this. You could mitigate the problem by not using the network until things got back to normal but it would still be a huge problem. It would be a huge problem for a lot more then just the bitcoin network though. 
@_date: 2016-01-16 02:41:24
Purse.io you can buy bitcoin with an amazon gift card. Paxful.com also lets you exchange gift cards for bitcoin. Sorry to say that you will pay a premium to buy bitcoins in this way. 
@_date: 2016-03-03 23:36:09
Double spending. I made another comment clarifying what i'm curious about. 
@_date: 2016-01-27 21:12:12
Are any shops offering a discount for bitcoin? Really seems like it would be win win. The shop doesn't have to worry about storing and managing cash and the customer gets a discount. 
@_date: 2016-01-25 19:44:34

For question 3 if your looking to show that there unauthorized use of the network caused harm to the the owner of the network. Increasing electricity bill might be a good plot point. It's pretty expensive to run bitcoin mining hardware.

Check out Andreas Antonopoulos he has tons of great videos on why bitcoin is useful and how it will become more useful in the future. 
Bitcoin as cash is close but not quite as good as the current first world system yet except for a few weird cases. It's getting better in a lot of ways and that's part of the value proposition if it eventually do everything we think it will be able to do it will blow the current system out of the water. 
Other then that it also has a few properties we have never seen before like digital scarcity and immutability. Andreas can explain it better then any one here though so find a few hours to listen to him.

Any one still answering questions? 
I watched a video where Andres was talking about why he was not afraid of a 51 percent attack because they would quickly be found out and excluded from the network. 
My question is how would they exclude them? Isn't it a trivial thing to rotate your IP address and start another attack?

Still there is no way out of that system. Maybe what they need to do is start trying to earn a wage in bitcoin. I do know it's a billion times easier to say then to do. 
Maybe we should all be trying to purchase products and donate bitcoin to venezuelan people and  businesses make it easier on them.

Dude above is an ass hole but he's not wrong. You should accept bitcoin one if it cost you very little additional effort or if you want to help grow the bitcoin economy because you are a believer. Don't expect it to bring you additional business.

So now it just sits on my desk out in the open ready for me to use it. I don't worry at all about someone stealing it I'm confident id only be out the cost of the device
@_date: 2016-09-15 16:13:46
Yeah, I agree that would be nice. Always keep in mind though that people that truly understand these things are working very hard for free to make them as perfect as they can. So unless you have the skills to contribute its best just to sit listen and support them. 
@_date: 2016-09-17 05:26:19
Sounds reasonable wish you all the best.

Not saying he is wrong but he does own a bitcoin company that could be targeted if the capital flight narrative grew so you might want to take what he says on the subject with a grain of salt.

Thanks for the Gold! But I thought we used changetip around here ;p

This is one of his better ones. Nice job AA
@_date: 2016-05-19 17:29:51
I think it's very important to link to people talking about bitcoin here so that people with knowledge can go and answer questions. 
That being said be a good ambassador while your out there please!
@_date: 2015-11-20 01:08:20
I personally would trust it. I use the site frequently and have never had a bad experience. I had one person try to scam me once it was painfully obvious and purse saw it and canceled the order before I could report it. That being said I've never spent more then 100 dollars at a time.

Hey Ax18 what about the fact that no one can verify trasactions for 6 blocks. 
What about the fact that you wont know if any one is trying to double spend for 6 blocks. 
I should think before i post

Yep [these] ( are the ones they delivered quickly and had friendly service. They seem to be good quality but I'm no expert. I would diffidently recommend them.

Any recommendations for San Diego?

Google has a feature that will send a message to someone for you if you don't log in for so many month's. I have it set up to tell my wife I love her and tell my little brother how he can help her access the funds in a way I know he will understand and won't help anyone else who gains access to the message.

I want to read all about the bitcoin related news from this but i haven't watched it yet and i hate spoilers lol 
@_date: 2016-07-05 18:07:59
So instead of proof of used electricity it would be proof of manufactured ASICs or something lol? 
@_date: 2016-07-05 04:36:11
I have not thought this all the way through yet. 
What if energy became abundant? If electricity is no longer scarce don't the incentives break down? I mean that would be a wonderful problem to have but it would still be bad for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-02-04 06:06:55
The top part of this would make a sweet shirt.

There is an easy way to prove this. Send him a signed message from the address it was sent from bit the fact that you don't know that almost proves your not telling the truth

How did this thread get upvoted so high lol 
@_date: 2016-07-21 23:03:02
Quite a few reasons. They are basically a bank and they do their best to follow banking regulations. That goes against what a lot of bitcoiners want. Instead of all the hate though they should just move to solution that has the features they prefer. 
Coinbase was also on the losing side of the block size debate. Again this is not something they should get hate for. All they did was express their opinion and act on it. They don't agree bitcoin is heading in the right direction so they are hedging by supporting Ethereum. 
They have never lost or stolen anyone's money or leaked any information that wasn't required by law. I am not saying it's the right place to keep your money just that it's not a bad place for some people.

I see. I don't understand why it would take so long but I know there are many things I don't know. I hope someone comes up with a smart solution. Thanks for taking the time to explain it. 
@_date: 2016-07-21 22:42:15
Don't trust anyone who is too alarmist around here. If you feel comfortable enough that you can safely manage your own private keys than that is the best practice but Coinbase is a trustworthy company that happens to be getting a lot of hate right now. 
@_date: 2016-07-10 00:43:00
Well I wish you luck in your testing. I'm in San Diego 2 if you ever want an extra set of hands. 
@_date: 2016-07-21 06:54:22
Also wanted to add that bitcoin does go a long way in fixing this problem. If you can't print money then you can't promise to backup everyone's deposits. 
@_date: 2016-07-02 20:17:35
Yeah, this whole should I mine thing comes up alot. Probably people sick of answering the question. They should get the fuck over it though :P. My 2 cents are if you research it out thoroughly and know what your energy costs are and you're just generally interested in mining then go for it. I think that about .05% of the population are capable of that. The rest should just buy but it sounds like you might be in that .05% the best of luck if you decide to go for it. 
@_date: 2016-07-02 19:18:48
lol who down voted you for not wanting to steal electricity?
@_date: 2016-07-08 22:58:05
try this i had the same issue earlier it worked for me.
@_date: 2016-07-03 16:12:20
This kind of attitude will kill Bitcoin. Better to spend and rebuy to signal to that you want retailers to accept bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-07-18 21:10:29
Is this the real deal this time? 
@_date: 2016-07-18 21:08:48
That was my thought. I was pretty surprised when someone said it was difficult. Well I wish you the best of luck.

Plus one for San Diego. Could go to City Tacos and pay in bitcoin at the very least.

There is nothing wrong with fractional reserve lending. The problem is the government covering all losses. As long as people understand what they are getting themselves into its just more risk for more reward.

I'm downtown that's a pretty good drive but if there is ever a bitcoin related project like setting up mining racks or something I consider helping out so I could see this experiment in person 
@_date: 2016-07-06 14:39:47
You are not alone. Developers are working hard at simplifying the process and unless they can bitcoin will never catch on. There are tons of tutorials of how to do this though and it's not as difficult as it seems. Start with a dollar and practice and you will feel comfortable in no time. Paper wallets is a free good way to do it and if you have some extra money hardware wallets make it easier. 
@_date: 2016-07-05 17:36:42
Still pretty cool that uber is tweeting about bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-07-09 20:36:32

I would like someone to be the bridge between Bitcoin and the credit card networks. All I want is NFC and no fees. Mine as much of my data as you want to monetize it.

@_date: 2016-07-08 18:20:57
Thanks! 
This suggestion from the thread worked. 
If you previously tried to upload an ID through GDAX, and got an error message, then later tried to log in to GDAX and got the loop. Do this:
Upload your ID through Coinbase, not GDAX at this URL:
 2
Coinbase - Buy and Sell Bitcoin
The easiest way to buy, use, and accept bitcoin. Using bitcoin has never been so safe and easy.
Afterward you will be able to log into GDAX.

[This]( is a bitcoin lecture series that's fantastic if you are looking to do a deep dive. 
The simplest answer is that there are many people watching and checking to make sure no one cheats and the system is built in a way that it's obvious when someone cheats.

@_date: 2016-07-22 03:31:16
No problem. All though I don't hate Coinbase I still recommend you secure your keys yourself if you have time to learn how. It's not very difficult and you will learn a lot about how bitcoin works.

Pizza place actually never had anything to do with bitcoin. Some bitcoin enthusiast in the US sent bitcoin to a guy in Japan that then called in an ordered the pizza on his credit card. In my mind that's a cooler story. Instant money transfer across a continent.

Bitcoins exist only as data. There is nothing you can physically touch or hand to someone like a quarter. Transactions are made over the internet near instantly. It's very secure and very intresting if you feel like reading in to it more. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 00:32:02
please fall!! i want to get in at a good price. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 20:25:09
How about a transparent shape of a coin in someones hand with matrix like text filling it in? In a cool but obviously digitally edited way. Conveys the idea of a coin without the implication that its a real physical thing.
