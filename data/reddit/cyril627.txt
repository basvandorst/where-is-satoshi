Amazon has been offering the wish list feature for many years without problems. We are just using it. They have their fraud detection mechanism built-in.
In addition we have our own account verification mechanism on top of it just to be on the safe side.

It works exactly like gifts and wish lists. If you receive something for Christmas and it sucks or you just don't like it, you can usually exchange it with the merchant. I don't think they would give you a hard time with that since it clearly comes from them.

Agreed, but unless you decide to opt out from the real world, you still need to pay for your electricity bill, your rent etc...
This service lets you do that while staying solely on the blockchain.

The discount rate will definitely adjust for supply / demand.
Right now it's 7% but if we see that there are more spenders than bitcoin buyers, then we will change it to 6%, 5% etc..
If in the contrary we see that there are more bitcoin buyers than spenders, then we will change it to 8%, 9%, 15% etc... until people find that it's really worth it to spend their bitcoins that way, even if it means replenishing right away at the market price and pocketing the discount along the way.
We are thinking of adding a verification system where a user could be trusted and their small transactions would clear quickly.
As for retailers accepting orders where the shipping address is different than the billing address, Amazon is clearly doing that with wish lists and there are many others. So I guess this would cover most products you can think of.

First we have a robust fraud detection system in place. More robust than some of the merchants are using for themselves, so that's the first line of defense.
Then credit card companies also have their own fraud detection mechanism.
So we are making it harder to post a fraudulent transaction, by adding our own layer of protection. And in the end, the users of our site are completely protected: you only release the bitcoins from escrow once you have physically received the shipment. So there's really no risk for the user.

Great post! It particularly resonated with me for multiple reasons:
1) I am also planning on moving to SEA next year. I'd love to have a chat about that. You can contact me at cyril (at) brawker.com
2) If you are living on bitcoins, then you might want to check out the service that we recently launched. It's called [Brawker]( and it lets you buy anything in the world with bitcoins. Best part: you get an 8% discount over people who buy in fiat.
I look forward to talking to you.

[Brawker]( is doing something similar.

Keep in mind that the bitcoins are held in escrow. So the "random person" would not be able to back out once you have ordered the item.
We are working in adding multisig transactions to make it even more secure and decentralized.

Did you know that you could have purchased it with brawker.com?
The way it works is that you create an order for this tool using a wish list and someone will buy the item for you on Amazon. They then get your bitcoins in exchange.
Best thing: you get a 5% discount if you buy with bitcoins.

Good news guys: you can pay with bitcoins for all these things by using Brawker.

We have our own account verification mechanism in addition to the merchant's credit card fraud detection system that is already built-in.
There is also a reputation system where you can do business only with trusted parties.

You can still pay your bills (in Australia or elsewhere) in Bitcoin using Brawker. I did it yesterday:

I'm positive. The idea is that it gets paid in fiat by someone else who will the take the equivalent amount in bitcoins from you. Check out how it works:
Disclaimer: I work for Brawker but I really use it to pay for everything

She could maybe do it once, but if she does it too many times, she might enter the radar of her credit card company.
In addition, there is a reputation system where people who are the most trustworthy will come on top of the list, so she will probably not want to mess up her reputation.

How is it not a prime candidate? If I wanted to launder money, I would probably not use a service where I need to put my physical address to have the goods delivered to me.
@_date: 2014-03-31 23:05:40
OK, so now you are talking about stolen credit cards which is a different issue than money laundering.
There is an account verification procedure in place to address that. In addition, there is a reputation system where users can decide to only do business with trusted users.

I tried to contact you on your "Contact Us" page but it appears to be broken. Could you take a look?
