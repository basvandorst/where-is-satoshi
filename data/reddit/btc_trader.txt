Just following the western trend that the UK and the US is leading, sad nonetheless that extremism is rising.

OpenBazaar is making the world a freer place one line of code at a time.
I actually just set up my store a few hours ago. Don't hesitate to send me a PM to test the BitMessage protocol and let me know if you don't find my node.

This is a good reminder that hashing algorithms can be broken. SHA256 will be harder to break but most likely it is just a matter of time and money.
At some point in the future, we will have to upgrade Bitcoin's Proof of Work (SHA256^2) to something more resilient.

Interesting, thanks. As said: `The problem is not that collisions exist, but how easy it is to find them.`
Also thinking of a mechanism to switch to a new hashing scheme is definitely a good thing to plan.

Great Manifesto copied from the GitHub repo:
To whom it may concern,
Markets are objects of censorship and always have been. There is a presumed division, that renders commerce distinct from the notion of free speech. But I will allege that the act of commerce is, itself, indistinct from speech. Where or how one spends their value is a decision as personal and poignant as any words ever spoken or letters ever written.
As a unfortunate consequence of freedom, bad actors will engage in repugnant trade that impinges upon the rights and freedoms of others. It is the job of humanity to cooperate and see to it that trade, such as this, becomes unprofitable. Whether it is accomplished through technological achievement or through the adjustment of social mores, or perhaps a simple appeal to the underlying natural law, it is not the job of bad acting third parties to force into hiding commerce that must be dealt with by means of an adjustment to the global, social conscience.
Cooperation, in the manner I was just speaking about, has never been plausible until the invention of The Blockchain. I will not foist upon Satoshi's humble creation such impracticable possibilities as the achievement of world peace.
But in approaching Drop Zone, I am attempting to do nothing more than what is possible and possibly more efficient than what exists. I wish for Drop Zone to be nothing more than an appendage to The Blockchain. As such, it is every bit as much Bitcoin as Bitcoin itself. Just as a fungible Bitcoin enables the exchange of spaceless value with near impunity, Drop Zone removes the ability of unwelcome parties from glancing over the shoulders of those in the act of an exchange, whatever it entails. This technology disrupts the ability of buyers to gain insight into the identities or movements of suppliers making supply chains far less vulnerable to disruption. It is this innovation that separates this project from all other decentralized market solutions.
Whereas Bitcoin forces us to consider the nature of money and value, Drop Zone will do the same for commerce. At its root, Bitcoin is a message passing system. Those messages that are passed, unlike any electronic message that's come before it, articulate value. Commerce is, and has always been, similarly inclined toward message passing. Whether in-person, over email, or through large, online shopping carts, fundamentally, commerce is composed of messages that are in service of the transaction wherein a final message of value is sent to a recipient in exchange for a negotiated good or service. As such, Drop Zone is a secure message passing protocol inasmuch as it is a platform for commerce. And while the problem is far beyond the scope or capabilities of the protocol in its most fundamental form, the observant might even see the tenuous skeleton of a full-fledged reputation system. Such a project is, in itself, as important and difficult as any facing this decentralized ecosystem.
I hope that Drop Zone lets us all dream of a day when no man will any longer be made to suffer indignity for simply engaging in unpopular or stigmatized commerce. May all commerce be created equal.
Today is a Beautiful day,

From what I can tell Drop Zone seems to be more oriented towards local trades, you discover new listings based on your gps position, while still obfuscating sellers' identities. 
Also, Drop Zone is a lightweight protocol that comes equipped with a minimal CLI interface, it is cross platform. BitMarkets comes with a full GUI client but is only available on Mac OS.

Where do you plan on launching it in the US ?
I'm thinking London, Berlin or Cyprus ?
