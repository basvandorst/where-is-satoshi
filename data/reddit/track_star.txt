That's not a mod; that's his business partner, Jimmy Nguyen, of nChain.

The "sudokus" represent the puzzle solving-like activity that bitcoin mining computers do. This puzzle solving, which is otherwise completely useless work that is intentionally difficult, is one piece of a complex system that keeps bitcoin's transaction processing secure -- meaning nobody can spend bitcoins they don't have, or spend their bitcoins twice. The magic is that it does this even though nobody is in charge of bitcoin or really has any power at all over it, it just exists as a result of everybody running software compatible with bitcoin's specifications.
The bitcoin miners that solve those "sudokus" are given bitcoins as a reward for their work. This is how all bitcoins start out, as some miner's reward, and this process happens approximately every 10 minutes of every day, all day.
As for the heroin, in the early days of bitcoin, it was commonly used as a currency on online drug markets, so a stereotype persists that this is what bitcoin is used for. But by now bitcoin is pretty mainstream and is used by all sorts of people, most of whom are not involved in illegal drugs.

How do you know they never claimed them? Maybe they just choose to hold them and don't want to pay transaction fees to move it. If you still have the private key and can seize the balance it's not really theirs until they move it. Just one of many reasons giving people cryptocurrency gifts is a bad idea.

Now would be a good time to stop the Reddit app from sending you notifications unless you enjoy getting bullshit like this.
