"This work is comprised of Satoshi Nakamoto's famous whitepaper words, scaled by Log N. Disparate ideas inspired Satoshi to create a solution to revolutionize modern socio-economics and industry. The work reflects on the elements that brought this technology to life, and challenges the underlying security model. Hidden in plain sight lies something more: a treasure hunt. 1 BTC is concealed within the work."

Same puzzle, one step less!

This goes without saying, but copyleft - free to use, reproduce, blah blah blah

After seeing a lot of hardwork \(and frustration\), we're going to make the puzzle a bit easier by reducing one major step. Key word a bit. It is safe to say that it will still challenge you to your limit. Funds will moves accordingly. Stay tuned for the new prize address! \(Will also provide signed proof from both old and new address\)

Check again, that signature is valid, as others has proved. Maybe you have an extra space in there before the 'T' and after the '.'
This is not a marketing hoax. We create many different designs and artworks, which gave us this idea to create this puzzle. YT (Coin Artist) was our inspiration. The design is copyleft, so you could just take the file and print your own. We sell prints of the design so that people can support more puzzles like this in the future.
