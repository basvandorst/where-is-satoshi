If I had the means to give you Reddit gold. I would. Instead I'll make you a promise of 100 Funfair. I will distribute the Funfair to you in 3 years.
I wonder what will be worth more? (I'd do BTC m8, but I don't bet the horse on the wagon.)

No, it's a good time to purchase things WITH Bitcoin. Bitcoin is not an investment it's what Apple Pay wishes it was.

? Wouldn't matter, long term Gandalf point is sound.
I've run miners at a loss, and the Bitcoin market changes put me into the black.
Short term loss, long term game. If Lehman Brothers could figure that out, I'm certain that G.E. can.

To use Bitcoin as an investment right now, sorry to say mate, is a mistake.
Bitcoin has walked itself into a target range. This is the biggest market trap Bitcoin ever wandered into.
It has CIA Contra painted all over it. The US Treasury has an enemy capable of collapsing existing economic systems.
If you don't think this is direct market manipulation that's going to be used to pump and decimate Bitcoin's credibility and reputation, you're pretty gullible mate. I believe in Bitcoin's long term efficacy, but it is a no-brainer mid-term mega loss in the making right now.
I see 2,000 maybe even 5,000 before a castrophic drop back into the xxx's.
I wouldn't advise my grandmother to buy Bitcoin right now as an "investment" as a hot potato exchange vehicle though? Hell yeah.
Grab it, spend it, boom, excellent.
Anything else is playing with a very crazy man's 6 shooter in Russian roulette.

Here's a better idea, use the excess heat loss to heat up and purify water.
Sell the water to California at a discount to help with their dumb stupid drought. Suddenly, we can all afford almonds again.

ETFs came and went this is a retarded pipe dream.
I've been in BTC since 2010, the winklevosses have been winkling their voss since 2011, ETF's came in in 2012-2013
jack squat happened because no financier in their right mind would try to move a fund to any significant capital gain in BTC still, I'd rather be the guy who was cautious on BTC, than the guy who was wrong about the edges of a bubble and never worked in Wall Street again

Staff? Lol, Bitcoin isn't a company, no one works for the wizard. Satoshi just sits up there in his magic sky castle and shoots bolts of Bitcoin at us via the lightning network.

The recent price inflation was by and large CIA driven. Quite frightening actually. They played Contra again, but with money instead of guns this time.

Believe me, anyone who has been in since back then has no obligation to prove anything to you. (I also certainly can't afford to give two shits.)
The only thing we prove is blocks, and the only person we prove it to, is the blockchain.

If I could have my ice cream AND eat it too.
I would want a hard fork + merge of the primary BTC network and the Ethereum network into a single contiguous structure, with a side-chain that paid out rewards to "node processors" essentially just fee rewards that will reward people who distribute the blockchain at high speeds, but don't mine.

Heh, new guys. Didn't think it would recover to $12 in 2010 either.

Call Globalfoundries or Samsung Fab labs.
Get a quote for a full proof prototype and then subsequent taping out and Fab production for a line. (PS, you will have to pay enough to have them dedicate production hours to your project... Meaning, you have to outbid Intel, AMD, Nvidia, and boatloads of other large corporations, to take away from their line production time. Then, whatever they quote you... Multiply it by 4 for sales, logistics, and distribution.)
If that number still isn't too high to deter you, go ahead and double that number again, to quantify the customer outreach cost you would need to over compete against the 3 largest Bitcoin asic miner producing companies, as well as against cloud mining and contract based services...
After all that, tally up your opportunity cost via your time and effort doing all of that, versus you just take the same amount of money and buy BTC and hodl, like the rest of us here.

Implying that my life wouldn't be shit without Bitcoin, eh? As a millennial I have some news for you, unfortunately it was printed on a newspaper. Had to trash it when I found it wasn't gluten free, and paper is bad for the environment. I know, because paper is made from trees, and trees caught fire and burned down a bunch of millionaires houses... While they weren't home. Hopefully, by throwing my paper in the garbage, next time we can hit them where their careers are.

If you weren't being a dick, you'd share it. Being a skeptical jackass is boring.
I have proof. I won't share it.
Your statement doesn't nullify my direct knowledge.
It's just a bait attempt. I'll be ignoring you from here forward, due to your "constructive input"
I didn't ask you to reply in my submission. Go satisfy your pathological need to be superior, somewhere, where people give a shit.

I'd rather not give any examples.
I followed the trail of something I was investigating recently, and there is a group making individuals that look like trustworthy people online. They are making alt-coins, forks, and wallets. They are working for an established monetary institution.
I refuse to name drop or hint, due to the resources of those involved. I will not place myself in that type of danger, but I know it's there. I want to know what the community is doing to counter these behaviors.

I mean in physical geographical reach, not population quantity.
The problem I am discussing is a problem that will grow with the population awareness increase.

No need mate, tipping is a financial transaction that's required to be reported to the IRS and taxed at input and output per the DFR act of 2020.

Good comment; but the premise wasn't intended to apply to Bitcoin specifically.
It doesn't matter what we know about the network today; to assume that it will be the same in 50 years; is as asinine as saying it's the same today as it was 10 years ago.
