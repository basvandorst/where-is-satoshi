That is true.

I get it now.  So there is no way to put the QR code version of the seed onto a piece of paper and if someone came across it and scanned it, they would still need to put in a password in electrum to recover the private keys?
Is this a dumb idea?
I just wish electrum asked for a password after you import your seed, like BIP38 paper wallet.
Does that make any sense?

Thanks though!

While I agree on most things, Dogecoin is not dying or dead.
It dominates all other altcoins by every metric on bitinfocharts.
Doesn't mean it will be around forever, just that it is not dying or dead, especially with those metrics showing increases for the last 12 weeks straight.
@_date: 2014-11-13 18:10:42
Love you!
@_date: 2014-12-07 20:40:57
I totally missed this last night, sorry.  Glad you still decided to work on it.
I will definitely give it a go when I get back home.
You should post this in the subreddit and on bitcointalk. I am sure it will be  popular.

@_date: 2014-11-02 16:22:15
Oh for sure!
I strongly believe it is in the best interest to have a blockchain supported by a different algorithm, just as a "back-up" measure.
Even if that algorithm never ever reaches Bitcoin heights, I still think it will have some worth, however small that may be. 
@_date: 2014-12-07 17:27:52
If I created an electrum wallet, put a passord on it, and got the seed, then fully deleted the wallet, would I be able to type the seed into any electrum wallet on any computer in the future and have access to all my coins once again?
When I tried to do this, it asked me to set a NEW password for that electrum wallet with my old seed imported.  So there is no way for it to ask me to put in my old password to verify the seed....?
Otherwise I will have to use one of the three options you listed.

@_date: 2014-11-13 16:38:11
Oh, it was not meant to be a bribe, more that they are the ones who despise it the most.
Tipping them in their subreddit would make sure they see the tip and then we can no for sure if tipping is still banned there.
EDIT: I just messaged the mods instead.
@_date: 2014-12-06 17:51:19
I am thinking of something like BIP38.  I don't know what I am talking about though.
Wouldn't electrum store access to the private keys in the seed?

In the link you provided, USD/hour would seem like the best metric.

Ummmm....we are seeing the same thing in Bitcoin right now.
Permanent inflation is there, but that doesn't mean it's dying or dead.
At the very least, is it deflationary inflation with static block rewards, and you can still predict the amount of coins years ahead.  
**Not to mention Dogecoin will have LESS inflation than Bitcoin until 2017 and LESS inflation that Litecoin until 2022.**
A LOT can change until then.

....aaand. The mods of and just got back to me.
Bitcoin tipping is banned there too.
Looks like that link is bullshit.
It's sad, really, because collectively, those two subreddits have 14 Million subscribers.
Maybe in time they will allow it. 
Until ChangeTip gets a specific list, going off the DogeTipBot list is best it seems.

I am wondering if anyone comes across my written down seed, is there any way to prevent them from having access to my private keys if they entered that seed into electrum.
I just wish electrum asked for a password after you import your seed, like BIP38 paper wallet.
Does that make any sense?
@_date: 2014-12-09 17:14:09
Even bip38 password protected keys?
@_date: 2014-09-04 01:11:39


That would be exchange volume.
Daily amounts sent in USD would be around 2.5 Million on average for Dogecoin, which is always the third highest after Litecoin and Bitcoin.

Litecoin is a plaything for traders of Bitcoin who are fine with a little more risk.
The top 100 transactions make up 60% of all transaction volume each day for Litecoin compared to 25% for Bitcoin and 17% for Dogecoin.
Plus, having an average transaction value multiple times HIGHER than Bitcoin's for Litecoin, when Bitcoin is moving in price, leads me to believe there are just a few large holders of Litecoin controlling a lot of the usage data.

Maybe they don't do it anymore for new users?
I just bought $1 of BTC with my Canadian credit card on there to test it out.  I withdrew the BTC after just to make sure it works, and it's all good.

I'm guessing the over ~5000 merchants supported by GoCoin's payment processing disagree with you. Yes BitPay and CoinBase have more...
[Hustler definitely disagrees with you.](
Dogecoin is still being used with ~25-30% of Bitcoin's transaction numbers, average transaction value, and number of unique addresses sending coins each day, but only 5-10% of amount in USD sent across the network each day.
Why not try and capture ~25-30% or 5-10% (depending on what is more important to you) more potential customers?
Unless you think the same percent of people who use Bitcoin will not use any service that has Dogecoin support, it seems like a fine choice.
@_date: 2015-02-16 18:24:51
