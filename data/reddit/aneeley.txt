less porn in exchange for less bitcoin economy. it's an honorable position. good luck convincing the community of it.

the government has nooooooooooo idea what they're talking about. both reassuring and disturbing at the same time.

the goal was to make gold, not money

i think  it's an interesting point of view that more people should know about, but it doesn't really have anything to do with bitcoin

A similar thing happened to me with ziggap. They accidentally sent me 6 extra coins. I brought this to their attention and they told me that I'm better than most people and to only send 5 back. A moral and financial victory.

why not just keep the money and not get a shitty tattoo? some things i'll never understand

except third world governments can be crushed by espionage and violence. bitcoin can only be crushed by solving P=NP, which is currently considered by computer scientists and mathematicians to be unsolvable.

Same thing happened to me. Don't worry they'll fix it.
@_date: 2013-03-25 16:05:22
the truth is nobody knows.
@_date: 2013-11-10 15:26:48
why do you even care
@_date: 2013-11-08 13:18:49
Awesome game. It would be nice if you could use the mouse to move left and right, though.

It's not, but it seems more analog than digital.
More importantly, it was a metaphor to express the essence of the situation.

He made a good point and you abandoned your argument. Just wanted to point that out.

i  didn't realize that it was possible to *not* make client side javascript open source...
in other news, bitchain.info is finally available for comment once the community as a whole calls them out for their bullshit.
you guys are assholes.

Would probably have more to do with the federal reserve than the government

lets take a moment to recognize the people in the future reading an archive of these bitcoin posts and laughing at how we thought 0.01 was only a little bit

the calculus part of my brain just had an unexpected orgasm

if party is defined as a group of people experiencing an exalted state of consciousness then i think it's possible
