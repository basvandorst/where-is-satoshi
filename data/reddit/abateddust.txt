Our department has the highest budget since we have to update and upgrade so often, so what we use it for is kept on a tight leash.

1. Not an English professor, bro.
2. This person is using computers that they are given access to in good faith, and they're using them selfishly for their own personal gain. If this was a one-time offense, I'd let them off with a slap on the wrist, but they've made it clear that they don't plan on stopping until they get personally caught. 
3. I've done my own research but I'm nowhere near an expert on bitcoins. Also, I don't want to make too much of a fuss over this just in case the person doing this is actually one of the IT staff, in which case things could quickly turn around and cause me to have a very bad day.

I have contacted BitMinter, I'm trying to keep my options open, though. You never know what may happen.
As for keeping track of who uses the machines. There's dozens of students that use them for classes, not to mention the IT staff that have complete control of the network.

I would love that option. The problem is that we're a very small college and the network is... how do I put this? It's not very user friendly. I actually graduated from this college with the resolve that I would turn right back around, get a job here, and work my way up the ladder until I could fix all the problems. This is only year one of my plan. All in good time, all in good time...

I hear ya, and I can't really think of a way to prove that I'm not the one planning malicious activity. All I can ask is that you trust the word of one random internet stranger over another.
Also cats, I can give you pictures of cats. I don't actually own any, but I know a guy...
