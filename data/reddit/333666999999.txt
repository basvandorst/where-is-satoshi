Can we buy baby blood in BTC yet? I never tried it but if the globalists are doing it, there must be something to it right? 
@_date: 2018-01-27 17:15:02
Sell now guys! Sell now!!! A genuine Nazi globalist says Bitcoin is fake lol. FUCK THIS GUY. I just bought more
@_date: 2018-01-27 17:36:56


Exactly. Once we hit the 50 tril market cap that I predict, prices will stabilize. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 22:39:06
Same with that dude lol. He has to say 1-5 so he doesn't get in trouble.
@_date: 2018-01-30 01:47:01
Exactly. Also, a huge dip is a buying opportunity that whales would jump on in a feeding frenzy. A tether crash wouldn't last long (2 billion is a lot but wouldn't destroy the market).
Although, a few exchanges that hold a lot of tether could go bust. Don't keep too many coins on the exchanges people!

Only a matter of time before we have a Soviet Union style collapse. Along with our bitcoins, remember to also collect a little bit of the 4 precious metals: Gold, silver, guns and bullets

You do not actually own your house. You have to pay a property tax on it every year and if you dont, the government can take it from you. There didn't even used to be a Federal property tax until the 70s. Before then, property tax was state issued and very much different from state to state. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:45:49


Not really. We had a gold standard for 200 years and ended up the wealthiest creditor nation.

There's not a fixed total of gold tho... it's constantly being mined. Just like bitcoin!
@_date: 2018-02-28 13:56:48


Yes, a few years ago, Kenyan doctors cam out and declared that they found sterilizing agents in vaccines sent to them from the UN. 
Of course this story would never be covered in MSM. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 13:47:56
Im just gonna decide to believe this, ok guys? Don't spoil this shit for me til btc is back over 15k. I want to believe. I HAVE to believe right now, ok?

Nah. Empires always eventually collapse under the weight of their own debt. Everyone goes bankrupt in the same way: Slow at first, then all at once.

He also is being sued by Indian for a batch of bunk vaccines that hurt a bunch of Indian girls: 
Some fucking nerve saying that bitcoin has hurt people directly. He knows that bitcoin has the potential to disrupt the world government he yearns for.

"Buy War Bonds! Help America defeat the Nazis!" Never seen those old posters? Bonds (supposedly) are the safest investment you can make. Which also means you get less than 1% back on them nowadays..... once upon a time they might have been a good investment.

Globalism is world communism. Why would you want that?

Think of it like buying shares in an atm company. They send you the atm and you set it up and then split the profits as well as holding the coin. It's like a Dunkin Donuts franchise. They send you everything you need to get started and instructions on how to set up. Don't you wish you bought stock in IKEA before it blew up? Auscoin is kind of like the IKEA of crypto...

When you look into far enough, the birth certificates and all property of a country is the collateral for every fiat currency. They say, "The goods, services, and **capital**" of our country backs this fake paper bullshit.

Because he's a globalist that has literally done a Ted talk that said we should reduce the amount of people on earth because global warming is going to kill us all 
@_date: 2018-02-28 13:59:59


Think about it this way dude: If you heard a guy going on about how there are too many people on the globe and we need to reduce population, then you also hear that he is giving "life saving and sustaining" vaccines to all the people of Africa, does that make sense? He says we need less people on Earth, but then acts in a way that supposedly increases the amount of people on Earth?
It's like if someone came out and said "Obesity is our biggest challenge!" and then funded programs to give free ice cream and candy to kids. Doesn't make a lot of sense correct?
