Banks in the UK can charge whatever they want for SEPA transfers, because there isn't any domestic euro transfer equivalent, after the banks removed BACS (some would say so they can charge people for euro transfers.)

It's a real stealth transaction:

They haven't emailed me back yet. I think that's how Transferwise works, yeah.

No exchanges currently allow you withdraw GBP. You'll have to use an EU exchange (Bitstamp etc) and stomach the SEPA fees - my bank charge £7 per transfer.

So, no concrete times for other countries then, just that Canada will be next, sometime in the future?
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:26:13
Mine charges a set fee of £7. You'll have to check your banks website

SEPA could be applied to GBP by the coalition, by they don't want to annoy the banks.

I was talking more about withdrawing money *from* an exchange, not sending money to one. I suppose you could try entering the sender as a business, but you'd need to contact the exchange first.
EDIT: I have emailed Bitstamp about this.

Looks like you can buy things on Steam with Bitcoins then, directly - 
**EDIT:** Only in Russian Federation, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus, Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Kyrgyzstan, Azerbaijan, Israel, Germany, Spain, Poland, Thailand, Czech Republic, France, Turkey, Switzerland, United Arab Emirates, Finland, and Singapore

Bitstamp charge you €0.9, and my bank (Danske Bank) charged me £7 (flat) for the incoming SEPA payment. You'll have to check with your bank. The best way to go from BTC to GBP is probably bitbargain, local bitcoins or bitcoin-OTC. Make sure you find a UK buyer

If you are withdrawing money through SEPA, be sure to check your bank's SEPA fees. I withdrew £22.76 from Bitstamp yesterday, and it cost me [£7]( [Bank Of Ireland]( (pdf) is free, though.
@_date: 2013-06-11 21:02:25
SEPA applies all over the EU, so I assume so
@_date: 2013-03-26 15:20:38
You would need the exchange's bank account information. You might be able to do it, but it would be a hassle.
On that second point, literally all UK banks charge massive fees for EU transfers. Mine is £7 - they are supposed to charge the same for foreign euro transfers as domestic ones, but there isn't a way to send euros domestically in the UK after they did away with euro BACS.

Bitstamp just emailed:  
"Unfortunately we are unable to process withdrawals to third party bank accounts at this time. We will look into your suggestions if there's a solution to this limitation that we have and if anything should change around this topic we will make sure to let our users know about it."
@_date: 2013-03-27 00:25:49
I asked Bitstamp support this exact question earlier. I'll get back to you
@_date: 2013-05-16 14:34:05
You'll have to check that yourself.
@_date: 2013-03-26 15:05:15
You can't use Transferwise or similar to withdraw GBP, though..

He has said Gyft will come to the UK in Q3. Is there a more accurate time now that we are nearly in Q4?
@_date: 2013-03-27 00:22:32
They cost ridiculous amounts if you're in the UK, though. Check your bank
@_date: 2013-03-27 08:27:35
What bank are you with? Mine, Danske Bank, charge £7 for incoming foreign payments and £13 for outgoing ones.
@_date: 2013-04-09 13:34:46
You can withdraw from Bistamp with SEPA. Press "EU Bank (SEPA)" on the withdrawal page, enter the amonut in $ you want to withdraw and your information - you can get your IBAN and BIc from your bank. They will send the money as Euros in a SEPA transfer, for a fee of 0.9euro. Your bank will almost definitely chrage for this - mine charged £7 when I withdrew from Bitstamp.
@_date: 2013-03-26 15:32:48
Bank of Ireland charges a flat 28cents for any transaction, and I hear Citibank has a good Euro account
