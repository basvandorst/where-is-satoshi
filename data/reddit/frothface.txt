....So, the accountants, legal, HR department, PR, grounds maintenance, etc, they are all going to need 6000 rounds each? They need to buy 20 years worth of ammo, because they know that the weapons they use now will still be their top pick in 20 years?


I absolutely agree with this. As an individual hobbyist / prepper / whatever, you have invested in a particular platform, you don't want to find out tomorrow that the government has banned further manufacture of ammo, thus making your investment worthless. That type of scenario doesn't apply when you're a government entity or talking about millions of rounds. If calls federal and asks if they can make you 50m rounds of something, they are going to listen.
What isn't listed is how long the contract extends for. If the contract lasts 20 years to supply 20 years worth of training ammo, then it's not a big deal.

Oh I know most common cartridges have been around for nearly a century, the difference is the weapon. It would be interesting to know what they were buying; depending on what it is it could shut this discussion down. If they are buying a caliber that doesn't work against the current threat all of the discount in the world doesn't mean anything. Look at how much the threat landscape has changed in the past 20 years. You usually don't train on a caliber you aren't going to use in the field.
Also, I'm not suggesting they buy year by year. You are going to pay more if you say I need x rounds in the next 6 months vs saying i need the same amount, but you can make these whenever you have downtime in the next 20 years. The only advantage to buying now is if you expect the product to not be available or you expect the economics to change - inflation, for example.

This is why we need to get rid of minimum wage and work on capping the top. Golden parachutes, ridiculous CEO salaries. Boosting minimum wage just pushes inflation and prices higher, which means there is no change for the minimum wage workers and the middle class has to renegotiate or accept a lower standard of living. If you cap the top you don't cause inflation. You put money back in the hands of every worker.

That still isn't very secure when it comes to bitcoins. If you had 21 employees and kept 3 copies divided into 7 unique key sets, it woud only require one person to corrupt 6 people, and in a worst case scenario it would only require 3 people to lose their copy to have a total loss.
As of 2013, MtGox only had 10 employees, so that's 3 copies x 3 key sets.
Also, I don't know the math behind it, but if you had the public key and 1/3th of the private, wouldn't that make it MUCH easier to brute force the private key?

This right here might be the reason that he DOESN'T accept bitcoin. If he did, it would 1) put pressure on him to return the missing bitcoin from Gox, but most importantly, 2) if he did steal the coins and is attempting to launder them, one would ask why people are converting bitcoin to cash instead of paying directly with bitcoin, traceable back to the missing funds. 
Then again, maybe MtGox had some legal barricades attached to do with it.
@_date: 2014-03-07 18:40:26
Your best bet would be to hope for 51% adoption of a codebase that rejects transfers of the missing / lost coins, at least temporarily until the community knows who has them / where they are going.

If that were the case, he would transfer the funds to a new wallet before the thief.

You wouldn't know until after you've already received the payment. If someone asks the retailer where they came from, they should be able to tie that payment back to the address they shipped goods to.
Right now it's pretty obvious who the coins came from. Once they get mixed down some, it's not so obvious. If it's going to happen it needs to happen yesterday.

I don't know if Gox would be keeping a private wallet for each trader, but supposing they did: If you could get your Gox wallet private key, then you could make a trade and spend at the same time (or very shortly afterwards). Depending on which one was accepted by the network, Gox would possibly have to roll back a trade with another (or possibly several other) traders.
@_date: 2014-02-27 19:12:35
Yeah but if someone were to 'accidentally' send coins to a seized address couldn't they make claim that they have no legal right to auction them and should be returned? Rinse and repeat, times 100,000 activists that don't agree with the seizure, and you have a headache / possible protest mechanism.

No, Mark. Just no.
@_date: 2014-02-27 17:37:41




Both of these make no sense. If they took them hostage, they have no way of knowing if there is another copy of the key floating around somewhere. They would have had to move the coins to another wallet to positively deny access.

**Trading.** It was an exchange, and for quite some time, the largest. Can't really trade on an exchange unless you, IDK, put assets on the exchange.
**Trapped.** An insolvent exchange has no outward indication they are insolvent until someone isn't able to get their money out. After that point, there is ALWAYS going to be someone who can't get their money out, no matter how much you insult them. They can cover 25% of their debts? Well guess what, 75% of the people there will get trapped. Not exactly rocket science.

If that's what happened, then really what they should have done is made hard-coded checks and balances - i.e. database constraints - then took away all users who had permissions to edit those constraints. That way even an attacker with full permissions couldn't change it.
At that point, your only way to go back and edit them is to take the database offline. I would hope someone would have noticed THAT happen.

I've seen raid controllers break and corrupt data on good working hard drives, and good, automated backups overwritten with the new, damaged data.
Shit happens. And unfortunately, with the stakes as high as 750k worth of bitcoins, having extra copies doesn't necessarily make the data more secure. More copies in more locations just increases the chance of it being stolen.

IDK about that. If someone bought them and was able to fix their technical issues, give customers a chance to recover what many consider lost funds, I would think they could really win over their user base. The hard part would be reopening withdrawals. They would definitely have to provide incentives for money and trades to stick around and show some major transparency into their financials. Maybe they could treat it like a stock dividend, where x percent of their trade fees get distributed to account holders.
Edit: this is all assuming that Karpeles hasn't fled with everything.
@_date: 2014-02-08 23:53:45
Actually, a price drop caused by suspension of BTC cashout may be their savior (reason for new clientele to deposit fiat). Or they could also be manipulating the price to get people to trade, thus earning fees in the process.

If they are blacklisted on every pool, they can't move them ANYWHERE without successfully mining a block on their own, and even then, the other pools could reject those blocks. It's not a choice of the person receiving the transactions, it's the choice of the miners making new blocks.
@_date: 2014-02-02 15:52:57
Keep in mind, Gox had one of the largest breaches. If they weren't able to cover their losses with fees by now, and their userbase starts getting down to those levels, they are SOL, and the users are too. If they would improve their services, they may be able to recover, but it may be too late.

My point exactly. No one knew what was going to happen, and in any event, they were speculating they were insolvent. If they only have enough to cover 25% of their liabilities, then obviously, even if every single person intends to pull out, at least 75% of their customer base winds up trapped.

Thanks for explaining this... So many people have NO IDEA what the exchange is actually doing on the inside.

Ok, but lets take that one step further. Warren Buffet shows up at a restaurant. Should he be paying $60,000 for a coke because he earns more?
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:43:09
That's only because USD or whatever you're comparing it to is more commonly traded. If bitcoin became the staple and USD was a minority of transactions, you'd have a reversal. USD would fluctuate greatly based on what people were willing to pay at the moment.
With that being said, I think bitcoin fucked up in two ways - by limiting the supply and with the progression of halving the reward. The halving should stop at some point - i.e., when you get to the 64th halving, it should stay at that level, because we will always have an increasing population which means we will always have increasing demand. People will always make mistakes and lose coins. If the value never becomes slightly deflationary, people will always hesitate to spend it.
Also, I think the supply (halving) should have taken into account the rate of adoption. Naturally you're going to have exponential adoption at some point in it's lifecycle. There should be exponential supply to keep the value stable, otherwise you're just generating bubbles.
Now, nothing is set in stone; if they were significant issues there is no reason the network can't change to accomodate the need.

If it's irrelevant, then why bother to ban it?
Kind of like when businesses complain about raising any kind of taxes or regulatory fees. "But we'll just pass it on to the consumer!" That's a bullshit argument, because if it were true it wouldn't matter to them at all. They'd have a greater opportunity to skim profit out of the increased cost. The reason they don't want that is because people will realize the actual cost of their goods and not buy them.

So anyone who knows where that bank is knows the person who owns it (a) has enough bitcoins to buy a bank with *SOME* of them, and (b) still has some of them.

@_date: 2018-02-19 14:49:21
I think that's what the stock crash was. Bitcoin came down, a few people wanted to jump ship and switch to bitcoin, created a dip and everyone else started to pull out. In the meantime major news networks were shit talking bitcoin to keep new investors suckling at their teat, investors were buying bitcoin on a downslide and pumped it back up.
I'm not a very scientific investor; I mostly go off EPS, div yield, market cap and my general opinion of the company / products, but the best trades I've ever had have been based around going opposite of what the major news networks are predicting. I'm thoroughly convinced that 70% of what you hear is just pump and dump, with just enough credibility mixed in to appear legitimate.

IDK - If someone gets hurt, the hospital can charge to treat them. I think as long as they weren't the ones who encrypted the files, they have no obligation to do it for free.

Yeah, but the problem is if you trace that out through 30 transactions until you find little bobby using a small percentage of stolen bitcoins to buy a pack of gum, you know they probably know someone who knows someone who knows someone who is behind this, but its such a large chain that you can't tell who is the thief anymore. You mix them in a mixing service a few times, and it just looks like it changed hands to an unsuspecting victim, but you don't know which ones are victims.

No one sells anything without someone else buying. Keep that in mind at all times. The reason they are selling is they think the asset will drop, and the reason others are buying is because they think the asset will rise. Eventually one will be right and the other will be wrong. 
@_date: 2015-03-05 16:24:57
You can follow every transaction and find out who has them now, but unless parties fess up you can't tell which one is the illegitimate -&gt; legitimate transfer. If someone "steals" coins, then trades them, mixes, whatever, and finally buys physical goods then that transaction is legitimate. The store that sold the goods doesn't know if the buyer stole them and neither do we. Until the buyer proves where they came from you have nothing. In the case of a mixing service or an exchange they  may not be able to tell where they came from.

I'm as close to comparing the two as you are debating the comparison.
The point is 'held up a sign' is a bit of an understatement, considering he held up a sign advertising an alternate form of currency on live TV during a congressional inquisition into what many see as financial wrongdoing.  Whether it's acutal wrongdoing or not, or whether bitcoin could ever replace US issued fiat is irrelevant. You have an irritated populace who feels resentment to the ruling class elite being exposed to something they might feel is a fix to the problem. It's the 21st century, first world equivalent to yelling 'it was them' in front of an angry mob.
For you to say $4500 for holding up a sign is a downplay, like asking if tank man was a hero for standing in the street. I'm not saying this man is a hero on the same level as tank man. I'm not saying he's a hero at all. I'm just saying when you consider all the circumstances, it's more than 'holding up a sign', same as tank man wasn't just holding up traffic.

Yes, but.... There is never a clean transition from one monetary system to another. The new system is worthless when it first starts, and the old system is worthless when it ends. The early adopters benefit, and the late transitioners wind up holding a bunch of currency that is worthless. The hard part is figuring out where we are in that lifecycle.
Bitcoin was worthless when it started out, but we've seen people pay $3k for some bits that were generated out of thin air. The government ignored it, but now we have legislation that appears to ban it, most likely because it is a viable threat to the current system. We know the total number of coins that can be produced, but we don't know what will happen, how paper fiat will coexist with bitcoin. If it were a government backed replacement of the dollar, we could take the total $ in circulation and divide by total bitcoins and come up with an expected us to bitcoin exchange rate, but the government doesn't hold the bitcoins and frankly, they aren't currently an appropriate monetary instrument for someone trying to buy a hotdog on a street corner. We will most likely wind up with a mix of both, which makes coming up with a final value of the bitcoin very difficult.
Now, if we had a final value and knew that bitcoin was currently less, then we could say now is the time to invest. I highly suspect that it is currently lower than the future value, but that depends on what the government does. Really, the time to invest was like 2012, but no one knew for certain what was going to happen, and we still don't.

Gee, and guess which is worse? A large realized loss or a small realized loss? And guess which one gives the holder the option to buy back in at a lower price, netting more coins (a gain) or some coins and some cash (also a gain)?
