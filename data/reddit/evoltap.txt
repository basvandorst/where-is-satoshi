It seems slow from our perspective, but POS crypto is right around the corner....there’s no stopping it even if they wanted to. The only thing in the way of mass adoption is the stability of the fiats, and we all know they are not built on a stable foundation. Patience and chill.

America’s new voter strategy: anybody but _______. 
Really makes it easy for candidates, all they have to say is, “I’m not _______.”

I’ve never been to the UK, but I’m pretty sure you have more heat pumps there than we do here in the states, if it’s anything like mainland Europe. You might just know that’s what they are....the indoor unit is mounted on the wall about head height or higher. They are *electric*, but they are not heating in the traditional way electric does.

Yup. I stand on the sidelines with my small hodl and don’t let it get to my emotions, only looking at the price every week or so. When I saw the price this morning, my thought was, “I should buy some more”.

We know nothing in situations like this. We can’t rule out murder just as much as we can’t be sure it was a natural heart attack. We know the tools exist to commit undetectable heart attack murder, so thats always a possibility until proven otherwise. 


I’m afraid assassination and murder are alive (pun intended) and well in the adult world.

Um yup. If you don’t buy the dips, you won’t have as much bitcoin. Hodl and stop paying much attention. Don’t invest more than you can afford. Chill the f out people!

Hmm what does this mean for the price of gold and silver? I always assumed they made a killing when the price skyrocketed around 2012.

Some years ago it has been said that the CIA developed a “heart attack gun”. Shoots a microscopic thing into the victim leaving barely a pin prick, delivering some undetectable substance, possibly derived from the nut you mention. You gotta assume they’ve progressed in methods since “suicide jumps” were the preferred method, as portrayed in Netflix’s wormwood.

Jesus, like not even aware that it’s a precious metal. Might as well have offered them 10oz of aluminum.

Or in a few months when it bottoms out. Stay strong and wait it out.
