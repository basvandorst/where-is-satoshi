So when you pay/gift someone coins the coins send a status report to the miner to record the transaction. The miner's host server then records said transaction and then initiates the transaction withdrawing the coins from person A and delivering them to person B. In processing this transaction (calculation: hence internet's money), the miner your coins reported to gives him leeway to produce the 25 BTC (soon to be 12.5 in 2016) ultimately increasing the size of the public ledger till the goal of creating 21mill coins is achieved. Did I get it right?
What about the code. How does that work?

9yr old: "Meemee, where do babies come from?"
Elder sister: "Magic!"
Lil'sis: "But why was mummy fat 3days ago and today she is skinny again? Do babies eat their mummy's tummy?"
Elder sis: "Well you see when mum wants a baby, dad has to put special medicine in her morning coffee and only dad can give her this medicine. And so the baby grows in her tummy for 9months and they go to the hospital for the docter to wave his magic wand, the same one he uses to listen to your heart, and takes the baby out of mummy's tummy!"
Lil'sis: "Oh so it's like date-rape! But legal?!!"
Elder sis: so shocked didn't even question. Said, "Yes" and let things take their natural course. 
Happened to my best friend last Christmas.
