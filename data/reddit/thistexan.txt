Not sure if it's applicable in Japan, but I have a Shift Card ( that links directly to my Coinbase account. I can use it anywhere just like any other credit card. The only thing it hasn't worked with is Uber. Still love it though!

The reason this is happening is because there's not enough infrastructure in place to capture, hold, and distribute all of that gas. It would be too expensive to utilize that energy to mine.  
Methane is too dangerous to release in the air by itself, so they burn it, which yields only carbon dioxide and water.
