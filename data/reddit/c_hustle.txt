Thank you for the feedback.   I’m going to look both up now.

This sounds like a good idea after I build up a little nest egg.  Thank you.    Question, how long does it take to get it back on line to start trading again once you switch it to Cold storage?

I’m going to sound stupid, but why not?

In the Robinhood App is says “Buy Bitcoin” and has the market price.   You click it and it take you to a menu that allows you to buy it.   It seem legit to me unless I’m missing something.    
I’m not trying to be a contrarian, but it looks like you can buy it.

Wouldn't it fall under illegal market manipulation or is bitcoin not governed by these laws?   (Generally just asking a question, I'm just getting into buying bitcoin.).  Thanks.

Sorry, I had just heard it was confirmed rather than a rumor, so thought it was more substantial now.

Do you cover a persons losses if you are hacked and the person loses their coin?
