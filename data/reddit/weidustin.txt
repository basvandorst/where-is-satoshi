No, we won’t take the machine back because of poor usage. If anything, we will take the hit and still pay the store owners what we owe them. 
There might not be demand now in some areas but as crypto gains adoption and people start to know more about it, we believe all of our machines can do well.

We aim for the ATMs to be about 10 miles away from each other, each other as in our own ATMs. 
We don’t mind being closer to competitors because we have lower fees and 24/7 customer support so customers usually choose us.

Keep us updated! If anything, we can create special discount codes for your store if it doesn’t do well. However, it usually takes a couple months for the ATM usage to mature.

We pay monthly rent or % of profit share to the store owner, whichever is higher. 
Typically the requirements are good hours and about 10 miles away from each other. Though exceptions can always be made.

ATMs allow anyone to use it because the barrier to use is much lower than buying through an online service. 
Nearly 53 million people rely on cash because they are unbanked or underbanked, thus ATMs are the perfect seeds of adoption because those are the people that need it most.

Good find.
