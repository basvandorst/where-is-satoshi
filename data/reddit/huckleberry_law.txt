He's a great investor, one of, if not the most successful of all time. However, he has said repeatedly that he avoids investing in technology companies because he doesn't understand their business. Cryptocurrencies are just another technology he doesn't get. What I don't understand is why he is so assured that cryptos have no long-term future.

The Securities Act of 1933. Most fundraising for private companies is done by private offerings only available to "Accredited Investors," i.e. rich people. Of course there are now exceptions such as Regulation Crowdfunding and the like, but still, most startups really are only available to high net worth individuals and their investment vehicles like venture capital funds.

I agree with your admonition on day-trading, but I would like to point out that short-term capital gains are taxed at the same rate as the highest ordinary income tax bracket you fall into for the year. So at the highest, 39.6%, and for most people lower than that.

Your success at trading is what will determine if it's worth it. Just factor into your equation that your trading gains will be taxed at your ordinary income rates. Also keep in mind that trading losses can offset the trading gains. Personally, I'd rather just hold on until I decide (if ever) to sell my bitcoin for fiat and pay long-term capital gains taxes, which are lower.
That said, I'm not a tax accountant, so if you get to the point where you have significant trading income, you would be wise to consult with a professional.
