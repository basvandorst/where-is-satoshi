Because they dont control it.  Money is a product.  USA has a monopoly.  They do not like competition. Especially competition they cannot somehow control.
The USA is not fighting Bitcoin yet.  Its too small.  When it becomes a blip, then they will find ways to fight it.

Jim Rickards has excellent credentials in macro finance.  He is a wall street banker (old school) and has been an off/on consultant for the US government.
As far as economics goes, Rickards beliefs are more aligned with Libertarianism then Keynasian.  He believes in "sound money" backed by gold.  
Rickards believes the markets can only be predicted using complexity theory since complexity is an emerging property of the trillions of tiny buy/sell behaviours (micro) in the world financial market.
He hangs his hat on science and believes the Keynasian economic models are flat out wrong which is why their predictions/decisions are nearly always wrong/flawed.
He openly says he has no opinion on Bitcoin until it goes through a "full business cycle" (boom bust period).

Why in the world would you want that?
If you are going to hand over $100,000 dollars to someone, they better send you Bitcoin to a public key whose private key you control.
If you are handing someone money and they give you a private key, you have to transfer it anyways or they will just move the Bitcoin out right back to themselves after your meeting.

You should at least post the thiefs bitcoin address.
Many websites hold the IP of the person querying a specific address (blockchain.info).
They will find your ip asking for the balance of an address.  And the thief's.
 (usually thieves dont realize that just asking an online website what the balance is for a public address pretty much takes away their privacy).
I dont know if websites do this, but the information has value, and im sure some do.
Posting the public address here may awaken someone's generosity.

Its an attempt to create reddit, but decentralized.

Imagine if, a thief steals coins and sends them to a specific public address they generated using bitcoin core.
That thief wants to see the balance of the wallet while away from home and types in the public address in blockchain info.
Only 2 people in the world would most likely ask for that specific address.
blockchain.info now knows the IP associated with the public address.
Unless the thief used tor or vpn to lookup the address.
Some (most) wont, since they think of the public ledger as a wild west.

Ask the people.  Not some "outsiders" view.  Watch the BBC documentary (a reporter goes into Greece and asks the people, Euro or Drachma?  The reporter is an economist and comes in believing "of course the greeks would want the drachma"  None he interviews do.)  .  See the number of polls that show plainly, the Greek people want the Euro.
As an analogy, imagine if in your home country you were receiving pesos for your work.  The peso was debased year after year and your family and yourself constantly felt as if you were being robbed by the government.  
Then suddenly, as an example, imagine you started to get paid US dollars instead.
Your cars are no longer fiat, but Ford/Cadillac.  You start to save and develop "wealth".
Its often easy to overlook the most important aspect of this crisis; what do the Greek people want.
They want the Euro, and if they dont get it; I would be surprised if Tsipris and his cohorts aren't booted out of government immediately (and an even more extreme party come to power).
edit:  and, as far as I can see, most Greeks blame their previous government for all the problems they are experiencing;  not necessarily the EU (although I do get a sense that the people think they are being treated unfairly by them).

Its an interesting question.  Initially in 2010-2013, 110 billion euros was given to Greece to rescue them from a soverign debt crisis.  Understand this bailout within the context of the times.  This was right after the recession caused by the 2007-2008 financial crisis so the outlook was "weak" and a collapse of a soverign within the Eurozone was "scary".
Their collective response (the "troika"-IMF,EuroZone, ECB) was to dump tons of money on them.
In 2014 Greek bonds were being sold on the private capital markets.  I believe in the area of about 6 billion euros.
In 2014 though, an important step was taken.  The European Stability Fund was created to "shield" the Eurozone from a Greek (or other minor) failure.  
This basically abstracted away the tire fire that greece would become in the event of a soverign default.
In my opinion, a lot of the "swagger" Germany seems to have in these "negotiations" (are they really trying to compromise or are both parties unwilling to budge?) is because, this time around, this ESF (European stability fund) is the shield that allows Greece to fail while the other members of the Euro can walk away with no injury.
Back to your question though (wow I digressed!)  I think its interesting the views of the extreme whistleblowers who believe that the IMF's alterior motive was to give greece tons of money knowing they couldnt pay it back, just to attain its hard assets in a liquidation (to the people who "own" the IMF)

This is a really cool idea.
The multi sig mechanism is genius.
Who would hold those keys is a meeting in itself though.
They couldnt really be updated (?) so once you knew a magic number, you would potentially know it for life.
And if someone wanted to "break" bitcoin, this could be an attack vector ("ok, we get the 4 keys needed to update the value.  We insert 99999999 and watch the network fall apart")
The code would have to be changed in a hurry and everyone would have to update.
Unless a mechanism was in place to switch the public address being "read".
Which is an ini file of some sort.  Or hard coded.. Or whatever..
Cool idea though!

Its not about stealing someone's wallet.  Its bigger than that.  Thats my point.  When devs make rash decisions by the mere fact of **proposing a vote** to see whether a theft occurs, the currency suffers and sometimes dies.

I believe the problems they are having have nothing to do with top level security.
It is the "backdoor" to your wallet.  The actual private key.  Nothing can stop a thief if he has your private key.
A private key is a number from 0 to quindecillion.  If I or anyone has that number, whether by "guessing" or not, the money is ours.
The weakness at blockchain.info was the private key generation was predictable.

As vbenes said, saying deflation is a problem with bitcoin is not only incorrect but the exact opposite is true; bitcoin's value depeneds almost competely on the fact that there is a limit.
If you were to remove the cap on bitcoin, bitcoin's value would be exactly zero.
The author seems to think that a deflationary currency would prohibit user's from using the currency, but the behavioural pattern he is observing is already studied and recognized and is called Thier's Law
 _If given the choice of what money to accept, people will transact with money they believe to be of highest long-term value. However, if not given the choice, and required to accept all money, good and bad, they will tend to keep the money of greater perceived value in their possession, and pass on the bad money to someone else._
Basically, the author see's alot of bitcoiner's _holding_ bitcoin and not spending it, then wrongly believes the same thing will happen if a merchant does not accept bad money(fiat).
The fact is, I and I believe all other bitcoin user's, would buy milk and bread with bitcoin if the local baker accepted only good money.
There are many times in history where deflationary currencies succeeded (see roaring 20s of the USA - and the Great Depression was NOT caused by the deflationary nature of the currency at the time).  
edit: to put it in perspective, imagine 
1)  you walk into the coffee shop tomorrow morning and you see a sign that says "We accept gold or dollars!"
You have gold in your left pocket and dollars in your right pocket.  What do you choose?
2)  You can leave $10,000 worth of gold or dollars to your only daughter who is 3 years old that she will get at the age of 21.  You have to make a decision today and put it into a time locked safety deposit box, what do you choose?
Bitcoin was invented with all of gold's attributes with the ADDITION of attributes that enables it to be used as currency.  This was not an accident.
editedit:  Also!!  I hate reading these articles that always pits bitcoin versus the alt currencies, as if they are head to head contenders in a boxing match.  They don't understand that alt currencies have as good a chance as strengthening bitcoin as it does dethroning it.
Imagine an alt currency that _pegs_ or directly connects its value to bitcoin.  Lets call it CurrencyCoin.  CurrencyCoin has the following properties:
1)  It is inflationary.  There will be lots of it.  But since its value is pegged to the price of bitcoin, its actual buying power decreases the more it is printed (mined).  Its supply is tied to the value of bitcoin (we will not talk about volatility, bitcoin will be volatile until competitors are dead)
2)  It has lightning fast transaction times (daily use)
3)  It is anonymous (built in).  Its cash, no matter where you send it.
This currency does not compete against bitcoin, it strengthens it. 
There are alot of alt currencies that have these properties already, but in my example we peg the value to bitcoin similar to how the world currencies were pegged to gold. (only this time, countries cannot decouple this pegging when they decide to go to war)
There are alot of currencies currently the align themselves with bitcoin like Ethereum, that uses the strength of the 10 petahash bitcoin blockchain.

It was the justice system (they went to the police) that forced the reversal. So basically, in the 1700s a **landmark** case states that a transaction of currency between sender &amp; receiver **is sacred** and any attempts to interfere will break the currency.  Fast forward to present day, the justice system rules the transactions are tainted and rolls them back in favor of the victim of the crime.  Basically the opposite of this so called **landmark case** and not a peep in the bitcoin forums.

Although QE pumped  2.1 trillion dollars into "the system", understand what "the system" was;  it was the big investment banks.
This money was given to them with the hush hush wink wink understanding they would **not** take that money and pump it into our financial system causing inflationary prices (consumer prices).
So the investment banks that were given the money (the same banks that crashed the system in 2007 - 2008) took the money and did a couple things with it:
1)  Stored it in their computers and allowed it to collect interest (I forgot the exact percentage that the FED allowed for but I think it was about 3% interest.  This encouraged investment banks to NOT ALLOW THE MONEY TO REACH THE PEOPLE.  This was important, because if _people_ like you and me got the money, we would cause inflation by using the money).
2)  The investment banks continued investing in derivatives (that caused the crashes of 2007-2008) AND invested it in other stocks/commodities causing "asset inflation" which is inflation in assets (wow stock market is doing great, right!?")
So ye, as Andreas Ant says, its kinda like "Weekend at Bernies" where the dead dollar is being propped up by this trillion dollars that was transferred between the hard disks at the Fed and JP Morgan Chase.  
QE was NEVER intended to reach your pockets.  It was intended to save the dying banks.
These reasons along with the fact other fiat currencies are being mismanaged gives the observer the impression that the dollar is strong.

The core problem with his argument is he seems to come from a context that mining is a "zero sum" game.
He believes if Bitcoin is unprofitable for one, it is unprofitable for all.
Centralization is one thing. Yes, mining has that tendency.  It does not however mean that it will ever cause anything near a pebble shaking up a large pond.
Non-techies dont understand that difficulty decreases when mining gets too difficult and miners dropout.  So what was unprofitable yesterday is suddenly profitable today.
Then he goes from bitcoin reward to no reward as if that would happen in 2015. it will take about 110 years before that happens.

Its interesting to see Proof of Work as an actual "Proof" that you did "some work".  The electricity, the hardware you spent money on.  The maintenance.  This all means something.
You are voting on what the "true history" is of the blockchain.
Think of it in terms of Proof of stake, where all you need is coins in your wallet to "mine".  There is no real "work".  Just "passive" maintenance of a history of truth.  Thats why it is referred to as "Nothing at stake" because you really didnt put in any "work".
So, superficially, you can look at PoW as wasteful, but when you look a bit deeper, it is not wasteful at all.  It is an expensive vote to what the transaction history **is** from the genesis block.

Theres nothing wrong with that.  But you can do that with under a few million dollars.  Just buy a few supercomputers with hardened operating systems.  Hire a security expert and a mediocre programmer and issue "dollars" that are just virtual (with unique IDs).  An ID can only be used once.
I assume your the government or Walmart, so just state to merchants these "dollars" are virtual currency and they should accept them as such, or if you are walmart, accept them for payment for your goods.
I just saved you 200 million dollars.
A blockchain tech currency is interesting because of its egalitarian minting of currency (anyone can "mine") and its "trustless" nature, you do not have to trust the government or walmart wont suddenly print a billion of these "dollars" and make it worthless.

You make great points, but if you, as a consumer or merchant, had the choice between YourCoin (inflationary) versus receiving Bitcoin (for all intents and purposes deflationary); which would you choose?
Colonial scrip was credit based and not debt based which is (in my opinion) the true reason why it succeeded.  At the time, there was no competitive currency to colonial scrip since the colonial governments controlled the in/outflows.  Gold and silver were scarce during that time period so there was no gold backed currencies competing with it (european currencies and there were no precious metals to create a precious metal backed colonial currency).
Fast forward to today, we have bitcoin sitting right beside YourCoin.  As a merchant or consumer, according to Gresham's law, people would not want your currency; your's loses value while bitcoin gains value.
Good points though and great job referencing the colonial scrip!  I always wanted to see a discussion in here regarding this.
edit:  To further this discussion and more of my thoughts regarding this, the main problem with a sovereign nation creating an inflationary blockchain currency is it will immediately compete with bitcoin since bitcoin is borderless.  And bitcoin will be lusted after in this environment which will prevent this sovereign's coin success.
Your idea would work if bitcoin could be controlled, but it has no border constraints.   And you cannot try and find parallels in the past like colonial scrip succeeding when gold backed currencies were available because the reality was, gold backed currencies, for all intents and purposes, were not available.
The next 10 years will be interesting :)

According to Defense Counsel in this matter, Butterfly Labs acquired this website on 
December 13, 2013. A true and correct copy of this record is available upon request.

Butterfly Labs. According to an editorial written by the former owner and editor of 
buttcoin.org, he was contacted via email on December 10, 2013, by someone named 
“Jeff,” who expressed interest in purchasing buttcoin.org. The editorial states that he was 
not aware of the identity of the purchaser or of the fact that the person was an employee 
of Butterfly Labs. 
The editorial further details how buttcoin.org’s most popular article 
prior to the purchase by Jeff was a piece detailing the lack of functionality of a Butterfly 
Labs “Mini Rig” that, the day after the purchase by Jeff, became a piece extolling the 
virtues of the same machine. The former owner stated that he later determined Jeff to be

The part of obtaining Bitcoin is where the friction occurs and is artificially created by current systems (KYC &amp; AML).

This guy is pretty grounded and well-informed.
He himself is a bitcoin miner and investor.  He is correct, for a business as big as Western Union, they have to observe and see if the regulatory environment settles down to a point where they can themselves invest and profit from the bitcoin network.
Great article.
It's interesting though, when the remittance domain is looked upon from a high level, that Bitcoin has an unbelievable advantage and can be considered a heavy-weight boxer in a match against a lightweight contender.
What I mean is, lets say you are an Indian programmer living in Los Angeles and send money back to your father and mother living in Calcutta.  In Calcutta there is one exchange that changes bitcoins to rupees, 1 grocery store that your mother visits and 2 stores online that your father uses that accepts bitcoin.
You send them bitcoin and they use it obviously to buy food, maybe buy stuff online, and cash out most into rupees using the exchange.  You do this every week say. 
But when looked upon as an executive from Western Union, you cannot look upon the use-case I just described and see any practical way to help/intermediate this process and provide value to the remitter.  There is no way to "help" that use case and profit from it.  
So ye, its probably obvious to all us bitcoiners, but it must be quite hard to come to terms with this as a remittance business.
Edit:  after pondering my thoughts, reading 's comments and gazing into the air in front of me for about 5 minutes, I think what I just realized is:  Bitcoin does not compete with the remittance market, because there is no remittance market.  **The act of sending money is not a market in the bitcoin world**.  Its intrinsic behaviour to Bitcoin.  Neo, do you think thats air your breathing?
Bitcoin does not compete with remittance businesses, it makes them irrelevant.

You require an "Iron Clad" contract with an exchange in the local area where the exchanges take place (for example The Philippines or Somalia).  Exchanging to or from dollars, OR to or from Bitcoin.
To or from dollars is the most expensive and, unless you have a good relationship with the exchange, western union can probably do it cheaper.
To get from dollars-&gt;local currency is easiest step here since everyone wants dollars in the 3rd world.
I doubt there is any local businesses willing to go bitcoin-&gt;local currency.

I think "hero worship" is more of a deflection than a response.  Stating that Satoshi Nakamoto created Proof of Work just injects context into the conversation.  The value of a creation or suggestion stands on its own just as the content of a conversation, but we should always have the full picture of an issue before deciding one way or another; and as it stands, Satoshi's invention has withstood a market that hit upwards of a 8 billion dollar market cap, has withstood constant attack and has withstood scrutiny.  
Of course he got help, but we should be cautious when tinkering with his Proof of Work since this is the heart of the body we are performing surgery on.

If an industrial mining company goes out of business I don't think that's a bad thing. They have an extremely small number of personnel who probably have profited quite a bit.

Gold has been the basis of human beings economic system for a thousand years, and this was not an accident.  Gold stopped being used usually because governments wanted to go to war and feed their people at the same time (while taxing their people by debasing their currency (printing tons of paper))

I think the title may be a tad disingenuous.
Reading the paper it becomes clear there is an angle.  He _hyperfocuses_ on perceived 
frailties in the system and after citing reasons why the perceived frailties may weaken or 
break the system, he checks them off some imagined list to move on to the next.
Dusted throughout, he sprinkles light compliments to bitcoin and its potential like a burglar leaving fake clues for the future detective.
He refers to bitcoin concepts statically, as if its maturation will never occur but the 
forces around it continually evolve and become more powerful and sinister. 
One example of this is how the author refers to scarcity as a bug in the system.  He fails to explain how the divisibility of this currency negates nearly any practical failure a currency cap may cause. 
He explains the cost of transportation and security in bitcoin is more expensive than fiat but bases these assumptions by comparing the bitcoin market cap to the US dollar.  
_So, as of today, in its 5th year of creation, bitcoin has not yet even come close to the  fiat world reserve currency_. And this is supposed to prove some type of point?. No this is to **lead the reader into a train of thought that bitcoin is a house of cards**.
Then he talks about how counterfeiting bitcoin is not out of the realm of possibility but displays no comparison to fiat (counterfeiting bitcoin is harder **by orders of magnitude** compared to a $20 bill) even though comparing bitcoin to fiat was ok when estimating seniorage but not fungibility.  
"Yet bitcoins (the cryptocurrency) do not actually exist". 
This statement seems to me more for causing _drama_ then to actually mean anything.  Unique identifiers can be obtained by hashing the transaction which is a unique digital identifier that is as good an _existence_ as the digital dollar.
"no one steals money off Fedwire or Visa’s system" even though credit card fraud is about 190 billion dollar a year problem..Again, focusing specifically to transactions _on the wire_ and not overall **fraud**
I mean, _rose colored glasses off_, visa IS easier to use than bitcoin **right now**.  I dont think anyone thinks otherwise so you dont need to spend _pages_ of a document saying it.  Or if you do, spend a page or two on how bitcoin cant be debased then compare it to fiat and how debasing currencies fuel nation states abilities to go to war or subvert other independent nation states. Or focus on bitcoins great strengths in its decentralised nature and compare it to fiat and the problems which may occur when you have exactly 12 people in charge of the money of 313 million people. Or talk about how i just sent .01 bitcoin to a friend in germany to buy a coca cola, instantly, from my phone, while sitting on the toilet..
I can go on.. Its either the author was sincere and lacks a true understanding of the Bitcoin system or he is just being disingenuous and is trying to disparage bitcoin.

I understand what you are saying but if BTC went to $1,000,000 many people would sell like 1btc, because there is a chance that it was being artificially pumped (as OP explained) then dumped back down to $350.
So basically, the ETF "subscribers" would ride the wave, then when it reached the proverbial _top_, the ETF participants would sell _en masse_.
All the while, the bitcoin holders who are not part of the ETF, could only stare at it.

In regards to your Bitcoin.  If you feel you are very tech savy   and are fairly certain you do not have any keyloggers or viruses AND your personal computer is kept fairly hygenic (clean), then yes; you should always protect and secure your money yourself.
On the other hand, if you do not think you could protect your personal machine, maybe it is safer at coinbase.

Fine.  Regarding your topic, firstly thank you for writing it, it probably took a lot of time.
I just am very wary of harming a system that seems to be working.  I understand the potential for network disruption is there, but I definitely do not support any switching over to scrypt type algos or any decision that would bring down our hash rate in serious chunks.
We can at least agree that the incentives to bring down the system do not align for any potential attacker and, unlike a straightforward PoS system, it requires a lot of electricity and quite an investment to do so.
Good luck with your business and thanks again for the post.

Bitcoin is a peer to peer electronic cash system that allows for services like visa, mastercard and paypal to be built on top of it.
If the devs decide in the future to "bolt" these services on top of bitcoin in a decentralized way, that would be great!
But the original idea, based on the white paper was to create a virtual currency that can be delivered digitally (or analog).
No where in the white paper did Satoshi mention "credit" solutions or "chargebacks". 
All of your "thoughts" on what Bitcoin "should" be is entirely in your mind and not based in reality of what it is.

This statement is funny because the opposite of what you say is the truth.
_The initial price of bitcoin was caused by people who wanted to hold it, not people who wanted to spend it. Furthermore, each subsequent step in Bitcoin’s advance must begin with more holders, not more spenders. The business that bitcoins can absorb is limited by its market cap. At a market cap of two or three billion dollars, Bitcoin can absorb many small businesses but it cannot be used for international oil trade. It would have to be dozens of times more expensive for that, and it can only achieve that if the peoples’ desire to hold bitcoins continues to increase faster than their desire to spend them. Thus, one who wants Bitcoin to become mainstream should never want its price to be lower. He should want an ever-increasing supply of hoarders._

Yes, bitcoin has more value than alt coins due to the network effect, we can agree on that.
Alt coins have the same and sometimes better characteristics, but I thought the conversation was about answering the question _What gives bitcoin value_?  
The simple answer is because its useful and scarce.  
The more advanced answer is bitcoin is 
**scarce** because it is a creation ceiling at 21,000,000 bitcoins.  This minting is rate is ensured by etc etc..
**useful** because it is transported instantly, 68,000 merchants accept it across the globe, it is fungible, it is easily divisible, etc etc
But the simple answer is because its useful and scarce :)

Exactly. If the devs rollback the blockchain then the entire currency is worthless. No one will trust the **gods** to not rollback transactions arbitrarily in the future and the fungibility of the currency will be lost in one fell swoop.
Since i have only a tiny amount of NXT, i will be giggling uncontrollably watching this currency burn if that happens.
They have an awesome wallet though.

Im sorry, but your post reeks of insecurity.
Bitcoin will win because it is a better money.  Its intrinsic qualities make it better.  
**I understand how tempting it is to use bitcoin because it is so easy to use but, for the community, please stop.**
You look much smarter to your friends by refusing to give away your bitcoin for a beer than giving it away like it was a stick of gum.
And the sorry state of affairs is that only half your message reaches the conscious thought of Bitcoin users.  They spend, then replenish maybe half or none at all.
If you are incapable of helping the community, that is fine, but my post is for those that wish to help.
You and other viewers of this post are here because the Bitcoin price was at a certain height that caught your attention. This price was achieved by BUYERS and not SELLERS.  
Merchants came on board because they saw Bitcoin was WORTH something. 
The network effect occurs because of speculators up until this point.
Bitcoin is easier than your local currency, but do us a favor and resist the urge to use it.  No one said this is gonna be easy but we are counting on you if you are able to help.

In my opinion, its one of those moments you have to do whats right for the currency and not yourself.
What if the 50 million stolen was rolled back and tomorrow 10 million is lost through terrible security at another exchange and the devs/miners refuse to roll back the blockchain.  
What about 10,000?  Not enough?  
It is just an absolutely abhorrent way to do money and will make user's **absolutely** not trust the currency.

I agree.  
In regards to the questions asked, bitcoin will be displacing other currencies if one or both of the following happens:
1)  A serious currency crisis similar to the crisis experienced in 2008 but far more severe.  A crisis that literally bankrupts 2nd/3rd world countries and seriously cripples first world countries.  This leads to a crisis in confidence of the reserve currency as many look for alternatives to the dollar.
2)  User interface moment occurs where an elegant, effective and super easy to learn application uses bitcoin in a way where it becomes mainstream and _cool_.  The reward for using the application would have actual value to the user of it (it does something with a tangible reward (whether mentally or physical))

Moonshot would be nice.  But frankly, I would sacrifice price if it meant we didn't sell our "core ideals" seemingly bit by bit after every regulatory hearing.  
Some people may find it hard to believe, but a lot of us support Bitcoin not to suddenly become rich but because we are completely disgusted by the financial system that we see around us everyday.  All of the corruption, the good people that have been literally "put down" like dogs (financially) because they did not fit into the socio-economic structure.
Although a lot of people will read this and think its a little pretentious,  I can't be more sincere.  I support Bitcoin not to "make a buck" (although that wouldnt be bad), I support Bitcoin because of what it stands for.  And sacrificing that is not even an option in my mind.

The confirmation time questions for bitcoin are really ridiculous. As other posters have stated, point of sale apps are zero confirmation implementations and are nearly instant. User's that ask about this usually come to from an alt coin reddit where they love their coins fast confirmation times.
Zero confirmation is not a problem and is safer than credit cards(reversible transactions up to 18 months in some cases), **so much to the point where it is not even close**.
PoS (point of sale) systems have double spend alerts and people normally do not want to be criminals and steal. If you are buying a mercedes benz they may wait for a confirmation or two but when buying dinner or a cup of coffee, im sure even mildly brain dead people would not want to commit a crime and go to the police station for a chicken dinner.
In other words, most people are honest, and if you are a criminal, then maybe you will get a cup of coffee or a free dinner (as crooks do today with credit cards or just running away from the restaurant).   Its safer than any system available today besides cash.

With your work on Bitcoin the dreams of a decentralized crypto currency have been realized. With this single idea and its implementation you have created the potential for more freedom and opportunity then most of the world’s politicians combined.
I urge you to not stop now.
Of course, you could retire to a well deserved peace. No one could blame you as you have certainly done more than your part to bring about freedom. But when game changers come along so does the opportunity to change the world in more than one theater.
The power of disruptive technologies is more than the immediate shift in terms of old technology to new, the old ideas with new ideas, but also a social shift in power replacing the old guard with those that have new world views. Rarely is it ever discussed how the old world views maintain their hold on us all. The creative destruction of the market place is the only force (other than war) that transitions old mindsets out and new ones into real positions of power. Your ideas are important. Your concerns are important. I would even suggest that your whimsies are important. Might I suggest that your windfall be taken to the next level?
Your decision to stay anonymous clearly says that you don’t desire power. Right now you are a mysterious anomaly to most. Please consider raising your star just a little further in case your anonymity is threatened. Your reputation and influence could be used to truly change the world. It is a rare event when someone that understands the importance and the power of crypto currencies achieves the leverage that you currently possess. Use that leverage! Create prizes to further your goals. The X-prize is the recent best example of the successful implementation of a tech prize. This concept provides many advantages that you should consider. First and foremost until the milestone is reached you control the money. Second the prize encourages and provides immediate financial motivation to solve the problem. Third the prize requires an open announcement of accomplishing the goal thus overcoming the dangerous power concentrations likely in defense funded projects. Finally prizes create their own media buzz and actually encourage scientists, technologists, and most important of all enthusiasts to focus on the issue.
Right now there are fields on the cusp of breakthroughs. These fields require additional manpower but more importantly they require fresh perspectives. Prizes encourage outsiders with out- of- the- box thinking to examine the issue. More importantly the human species needs these new frontiers to survive. Molecular manipulation, space travel, portable energy, cryonics, life-extension, and retaining anonymity in the digital realm are all areas that could transform our civilization. With such technological shifts come social shifts and old guard social systems despite their historical momentum can then be replaced by better alternatives.
The technology already exists where you can have an impact and keep your anonymity. With a Tor hidden service, you can create anonymous websites that promote your prizes. Announce a public key with an account linked to Satoshi Nakamoto and you are verified as the “real” SN participating in the prize along with the ability to communicate anonymously.
I write this letter out of shear selfishness. Despite the delusions of politicians and the media’s talking heads we don’t live in a free world. I want to live in a free world where all individuals have the core right of self determination. We need to use these frontiers that anonymity provides to create that free world now.
As governments realize the implications to innovations such as Bitcoin and Tor, they will react in fear. Massive data collection is simply the first step. As anonymous activity becomes more technologically assured they will create new laws and harsh penalties for anonymous behaviors. I believe that many of us will continue to strive for freedom and frontiers. But I fear these new laws will create a terrible body count along the way. This is the path that we are currently on and I hope with your help to avoid.
I know that it is not a pleasant thought but please consider the likelihood that your identity will eventually be revealed. Ask yourself would you rather have it on your terms or another’s? Why not have most of the world on your side?
With deepest respect and regards,

It would be nice if "normal" people could mine, but just think of the massive botnets hacker groups have amassed since the inception of the internet.
We are talking about hundreds of thousands of computers/cpus that are controlled by hackers.
It is not relevant currently because they cannot damage the network without ASICs.  These hackers cannot "control" the network.  These hackers in the shadows would follow no rules and corrupt the network every chance they would get as long as it profited them personally.
With ASICs, you have shareholders, regulation, government bodies with big guns and the community all staring at you literally (blockchain is open).

A split, causing two chains, would most likely (definitely) result in one chain being completely worthless.

With European inflation declining to 0.3%, and U.S. inflation slowing, a specter now haunts the Western world. Deflation, the Economist recently proclaimed, is a “pernicious threat” and “the world’s biggest economic problem.” Christine Lagarde , managing director of the International Monetary Fund, called deflation an “ogre” that could “prove disastrous for the recovery.”
True, a sudden, large and sharp collapse in prices, such as occurred in the early 1920s and 1930s, would be a problem: Debtors might fail, some prices and wages might not adjust quickly enough. But these deflations resulted directly from financial panics, when central banks couldn’t or didn’t accommodate a sudden demand for money.
The worry today is a slow slide toward falling prices, maybe 1% to 2% annually, with perpetually near-zero short-term interest rates. This scenario would unfold alongside positive, if sluggish, growth, ample money and low credit spreads, with financial panic long passed. And slight deflation has advantages. Milton Friedman long ago recognized slight deflation as the “optimal” monetary policy, since people and businesses can hold lots of cash without worrying about it losing value. So why do people think deflation, by itself, is a big problem?
1) Sticky wages. A common story is that employers are loath to cut wages, so deflation can make labor artificially expensive. With product prices falling and wages too high, employers will cut back or close down.
Sticky wages would be a problem for a sharp 20% deflation. But not for steady 2% deflation. A typical worker’s earnings rise around 2% a year as he or she gains experience, and another 1%—hopefully more—from aggregate productivity growth. So there could be 3% deflation before a typical worker would have to take a wage cut. And the typical worker also changes jobs, and wages, every 4½ years. Moreover, “typical” is the middle of a highly volatile distribution of wage changes among a churning job market. Ultimately very few additional workers would have to take nominal wage cuts to accommodate 2% deflation.
Curiously, if sticky wages are the central problem, why do we not hear any loud cries to unstick wages: lower minimum wages, less unionization, less judicial meddling in wages such as comparable worth and disparate-impact discrimination suits, fewer occupational licenses and so forth?
2) Monetary policy headroom. The Federal Reserve wants a 2% inflation rate. That’s because with “normal” 4% interest rates, the Fed will have some room to lower interest rates when it wants to stimulate the economy. This is like the argument that you should wear shoes two sizes too small, because it feels so good to take them off at night.
The weight you put on this argument depends on how much good rather than mischief you think the Fed has achieved by raising and lowering interest rates, and to what extent other measures like quantitative easing can substitute when rates are stuck at zero. In any case, establishing some headroom for stimulation in the next recession is not a big problem today.
3) Debt payments. The story here is that deflation will push debtors, and indebted governments especially, to default, causing financial crises. When prices fall unexpectedly, profits and tax revenues fall. Costs also fall, but required debt payments do not fall.
Again, a sudden, unexpected 20% deflation is one thing, but a slow slide to 2% deflation is quite another. A 100% debt-to-GDP ratio is, after a year of unexpected 2% deflation, a 102% debt-to-GDP ratio. You’d have to go decades like this before deflation causes a debt crisis.
Strangely, in the next breath deflation worriers tell governments to deliberately borrow lots of money and spend it on stimulus. This was the centerpiece of the IMF’s October World Economic Outlook antideflation advice. The IMF at least seemed to realize this apparent inconsistency, claiming that spending would be so immensely stimulative that it would pay for itself.
4) Deflation spiral. Keynesians have been warning of a “deflation spiral” since Japanese interest rates hit zero two decades ago. Here’s the story: Deflation with zero interest is the same thing as a high interest rate with moderate inflation: holding either money or zero-interest rate bonds, you can buy more next year. This incentive stymies “demand,” as people postpone consumption. Falling demand causes output to fall, more deflation, and the economy spirals downward.
It never happened. Nowhere, ever, has an economy such as ours or Europe’s, with fiat money, an interest-rate target, massive excess bank reserves and outstanding government debt, experienced the dreaded deflation spiral. Not even Japan, though it has had near-zero inflation for two decades, experienced the predicted spiral.
There are good reasons to believe it can’t happen. Most of all, government solvency fears that don’t matter for 2% deflation kick in and stop a deflation spiral. If prices fall 20%, or 30%, bond-holders will see that governments cannot pay back debts. They try to get rid of their bonds before the coming default. They buy things or other currencies, nipping the deflation spiral in the bud.
There is an unsettling feature of the current inflation situation, however. Clearly, our central banks want higher inflation, and the current slow decline was unintended. So, just as clearly, central banks have a lot less understanding of and control over inflation and deflation than most people think.
According to the conventional worldview, the economy is inherently unstable. Central banks control inflation the way you balance an upside-down broom, with interest rates on the bottom and inflation on top. Central banks have to actively move interest rates around to keep inflation and deflation from breaking out. And if they want more inflation, they must temporarily move interest rates the wrong way, let the inflation increase, and then move quickly to stabilize it.
Hence the zero-bound worry. When interest rates hit zero and the Fed can’t move the broom handle any more, the top of the broom must topple into deflation. Except we hit the zero bound, and almost nothing happened. Maybe the economy isn’t so inherently unstable and in need of constant guidance after all.
Bottom line? Relax. Every few months we hear a new “biggest economic problem” from which our “policy makers” must save us. Wait for the next one.

I get the same reaction from people.  The best thing to do is to explain bitcoin to them as simply as possible.  
I believe in Bitcoin because I'm just tired of these stupid credit cards that were invented in the 1950s and they are so clumsy to use on the internet and I always get nervous using them in stores or whatever (looking behind my back when i type in my code lol)
Bitcoin is like cash except i can send it instantly, to anyone!  Anywhere!  
You see, we invented banks to keep track people's money.  If you have $5 and send $3 to someone, the bank subtracts $3 from you and gives it to the other person.  They keep that in something like a spreadsheet.  And this is the greatest part of this bitcoin invention!  
Bitcoin was invented a way that computers can tell if this spreadsheet is wrong.  Its like a lie detector thats 100% correct every time.  And its computers that do it, not people or banks.  So now, with bitcoin, we don't have to trust banks.  Banks have failed us so many times in the past, the corruption and fraud I would rather trust the math in the computers.
And bitcoin can't be counterfeit.  The same protection we have for our nuclear bombs is the same protection they put on bitcoin.  Do you have a $20 bill in your pocket?  There are estimates that theres like $60 to $80 million dollars counterfeit in circulation right now.  Bitcoin cant be faked.
Anyways, one of the greatest things about bitcoin, its kind of like an IPO (initial public offering) for the internet!  Unlike the internet, you can basically _buy in_ to bitcoin if you believe its better than the way we do money today.
Not to go on too much of a rant, I just believe we gave the current economic system its chance, and its done well.  It got us to where we are today. We don't hate it just like you dont hate a fax machine when you send an email.  It had its time in the sun but its time for a new time.  I believe money version 2.0 is here and I wouldn't miss it for the world!

The blockchain without a currency thats worth around $300 is a worthless thing.
If you did not have a token worth about $300 being given out to miners, you have a blockchain that can be easily taken over.
And before you say,"well, maybe another coin can achieve $300?".  Do you realize how difficult Bitcoin's rise has been? The only way another token can come close to Bitcoin's value is if the other token had features that completely destroyed Bitcoin.  And there are no coins today that possess these features.  Bitcoin destroys fiat currency because of its feature list.  
The gap between fiat-&gt;bitcoin is huge and another token would need to achieve this level of improvement to be even considered (and no, intrinsic anonymity, faster transaction times are drops of water in the lake needed to be filled before bitcoin gets displaced)

Giving your bitcoin to anyone or anything else tells them that the value of what you are getting exceeds or is equal to the value of what you are giving.  
You hoarding your bitcoins increases the value of bitcoin which makes people want bitcoin that much more which makes more people opt into the bitcoin system by purchasing bitcoin which increases its value and then they hoard and that increases the price and makes others want bitcoin so they opt in and..
Dont ask merchants if they will accept bitcoin, ask them if you could pay in dollars and get your change in bitcoin.  Now that would be something!

Heres how to regulate bitcoin.
Accept bitcoin as legal tender.
Make the spending of your tax dollars completely transparent by having a publiclly know bitcoin address.
Allow public employees be paid in bitcoin.
Government spends responsibly and is publicly audited.
Welfare programs for non mental health related cases are cut and instead a basic income is incorporated where all citizens are allocated a monthly stipend which allows for the betterment of oneself.  If one wishes to sit in his/her apartment and play video games his/her whole life, feel sorry for them, but that is fine at least those that have passions for improving mankind actually realize their potential instead of being forced into manual labor due to artificial economic markets.
Make taxation voluntary but give incentives.
My opinion!
edit:  I guess i didnt answer the question!!  With a little effort (darkwallets) bitcoin will become like cash.  How do you regulate cash?  You can try, but you cannot.  Therefor the only reasonable answer is to have people that transact in bitcoin to voluntarily pay the government.

I havent read every thread posted here but some advice from me :=)
There is a behavioural pattern that _some_ bitcoiners go through that is repetitive.
1)  A lot of the times, Bitcoiners will start by trying to mine.
2)  After finding it either too complicated or too unprofitable, they give up and buy their first bitcoin (now they are in your position)
3)  Next, they get a little deeper into OTHER crypto currencies.  Wow, stealth addresses!  Fast confirmation times!  A dog on the coin!  This is gonna be big and Im not missing the boat again!  They then start moving BTC to crypto exchanges and buy alt coins thinking one of these might "blow up" like bitcoin.
Most alt coins are "pump and dumps".  Yes they have nice features, but until an alt coin puts something "radically" better on their coin, bitcoin is here to stay. (radically meaning bitcoin does not use banks and is invisible and instant and cannot be counterfeit OVER the dollar type radical jump)
The next number you are going to go to is 10.  What if I had 10 whole bitcoins going into the "double digit" phase.  1-10 is usually plagued by you putting a half btc here and there into alts (you getting scammed).
10 is huge.  Once you get there you feel like a boss.  Then, its 21.  If you have 21 BTC, you become "1 in a million"
Your rise from 10-21 is a phase where you are much wiser.  You understand spending your BTC is foolish since it means more to you than the paper and fake numbers in your bank, so just use cash and HODL btc.
When you hit 21, the next phase will be 42.
Because  the total weight of the Milky Way is even with 42 echoes. The answer is 3 X 10 ^ 42 (kg), which is followed by 42 zeros.

The confirmation time questions for bitcoin are really ridiculous.  As other posters have stated, point of sale apps are zero confirmation implementations and are nearly instant. User's that ask about this usually come to from an alt coin reddit where they love their coins fast confirmation times. 
Zero confirmation is not a problem and is safer than credit cards, so much to where it is not even close.
PoS systems have double spend alerts and people normally do not want to be criminals and steal.  If you are buying a mercedes benz they may wait for a confirmation or two but when buying dinner or a cup of coffee, im sure even mildly brain dead people would not want to commit a crime and go to the police station for a chicken dinner.

First off, i assume 100 billion coins theft is an exaggeration expressing a large theft occurred.

Not all feel this way obviously.  But painting regulation on top of problems such as these does no good.  It merely gives society an excuse to check a box and not try and find the underlying reason why individuals feel this way and correct it at its genesis.  Basically regulation covers up underlying societal problems.
The main point I am trying to express is that governments are not financial institutions and shouldn't be.  Ideally financial architectures should have a separation of concerns/responsibilities.  Governments injecting regulation into financial systems corrupts the systems it was designed to protect.

Give Bitcoin time.  As it matures, companies will start providing insurance etc.
And as to your question, when you "lose" BTC, it is lost forever.  Lose 15 BTC = subtract 15 BTC from the overall total, which makes everyone else a little "richer" since bitcoin becomes more scarce and the value of everyone elses bitcoin becomes more valuable.

To Mr IPad chain,
There is a behavioural pattern that some bitcoiners go through that is repetitive.
1) A lot of the times, Bitcoiners will start by trying to mine.
2) After finding it either too complicated or too unprofitable, they give up and buy their first bitcoin (or receive it somehow,now they are in your position)
3) Next, they get a little deeper into OTHER crypto currencies. Wow, stealth addresses! Fast confirmation times! A dog on the coin! This is gonna be big and Im not missing the boat again! They then start moving BTC to crypto exchanges and buy alt coins thinking one of these might "blow up" like bitcoin.
Alt coins are "pump and dumps". There are maybe 1-5 guys that spend a day or so copying bitcoin, then call it a "bitcoin 2.0 coin", "pump it" onto the forums (they own usually 40%-90% of the coin), when it is worth something from pumping it, they sell everything they have (dump it) and disappear.  When they run out of money they do it again.
The miracle of Bitcoin having a market price is pretty much the same probability we find sentient life on another planet.  Bitcoin having value was a treacherous and tough journey that required superhuman effort.  No alt coin can achieve this.  Yes they have nice features, but until an alt coin puts something "radically" better on their coin, bitcoin is here to stay. (radically meaning bitcoin does not use banks and is invisible and instant and cannot be counterfeit OVER the dollar type radical jump)
The next number you are going to go to is 10. What if I had 10 whole bitcoins going into the "double digit" phase. 1-10 is usually plagued by you putting a half btc here and there into alt-coins (**you getting scammed**).
10 is huge. Once you get there you feel like a boss. Then, its 21. If you have 21 BTC, you become "1 in a million".  No more than 1,000,000 people on this planet of 7 billion will ever own more than 21 BTC and you just became that person.
Your rise from 10-21 is a phase where you are much wiser. You understand spending your BTC is foolish since it means more to you than the paper and fake numbers in your bank, so just use cash and HODL btc.
When you hit 21, the next phase will be 42.
Because the total weight of the Milky Way is even with 42 echoes. The answer is 3 X 10 ^ 42 (kg), which is followed by 42 zeros.

5)  I think bitcoin is a terrible currency because.. He left that part out
6)  tip4commit sucks to me cause I live in this highly regulated, high standard of living country and do not wish to be bothered (spams email box)

Isn't that ownership?  When implementing the sidechain, this "contract" must be implemented.  The BTC should be "burned" or destroyed right? Hmm, how would that affect price :O
I am not understanding the mechanic I think.  I guess you couldnt "burn" the BTC because that would mean the scarcity of BTC would increase.
But you couldnt "release" the BTC, because the sidechain's token would most likely be partially spent (the whole reason you purchased the alt token) OR, maybe half the time, you wouldnt even return any amount back to the BTC blockchain.
Care to enlighten me?
I guess after thinking about this more, the ownership of the BTC would obviously be transferred to the "seller" of the alt token.
And thats why they would call it a "peg".  Because the price of the alt tolken would directly correlate to the unit of bitcoin.
But then, true ownership IS transferred.

Slights on our liberty, inequality in America and the moral bankruptcy we see today, in my opinion, stems from The Federal Reserve (the real owners, the bankers behind the fed)-&gt; that owns the key leaders/politicians/judges in the US and many other western nations.
There is not much a human wouldnt do when someone says "write down a number" and no matter how high that number is, the powers that own the fed can pay it; because they can just print the money they need.  Any number.
Rick Falkvinge I think sees it clearly, but the scope of the problem goes well beyond america.  The statement of "America is lost, but we Europeans can.." is ridiculous.  To say he has friends here that will not betray him for a price is disingenuous.
I highly doubt the Pirate Bay founders would have been jailed and prosecuted without a lot of bribing, strong arming and threats from the US.  The people that turned them in are the same Europeans that you call for help.
Julian Assange accused of rape in Sweden right at the height of the United State's crusade to bring him to justice;  coincidence?
So yes, I strongly support Rick Falkvinge and his views but finding a way out via the support of the judicial system or any other systemic resource is futile.  
The fourth box is basically de-claw the monster.  Take away its money.  The fourth box is not violence or Occupy Wallstreet.  The fourth box is Bitcoin.  Remove the ability to exert power over human beings across the globe by removing its ability to be the masters of money.  That is the cancer that plagues us in my opinion.  
So ye, when I buy Bitcoin I kinda hope it goes up in value so maybe I can plant a garden in a nice big house one day. But I buy Bitcoin mainly because I believe each Bitcoin is a vote to opt-out of this corrupted and perverted financial system.

I think you are talking about exchanges/web wallets.
Yes, Bitcoin is pseudo-anonymous and requires no identity or "agree to these terms".  There is absolutely no proof needed to use it.
**What you are _feeling_ is the friction created by fiat currency**.  The "muddy waters" is the point at which fiat currency _touches_ bitcoin at an exchange.
Since exchanges handle money, most reputable exchanges require AML (anti-money laundering) and KYC (Know your customer) regulations to be adhered to or they will be shut down.  
just gave you 2500 bits.  That is Bitcoin.  **There is no friction**.  When a bit is a buck that would be equivalent to giving you $2500, no kyc, no aml, no address needed, hell **he doesnt even know your first name**. 
That is Bitcoin.

If you want America to collapse you must live in China or Russia.  How soon you forget the only thing stopping the constant takeover of europe either by a state within the EU or a non european state has been the threat of american intervention.
The powers that be in america are corrupt and that system needs to fail and replaced by one (as the OP says) where money and the state are separated.  Where the government cannot just print money.  A system where, if the government wants to go to war, or have a war on drugs, the govt needs the citizens to sacrifice in order to pay for it.  The citizens, when facing hunger, will rethink this new war the government has proposed; and a hungry citizen is a dangerous citizen.  
All the problems we see with America is rooted in this very fact; they are printing money out of thin air.  The OPs point is the solution to this (though getting there may require a revolution)

_Working in the Bitcoin world is like working for a drug addict with bipolar disorder. There are brief periods of astonishing, irrational exuberance followed by long periods of deep existential dread over basically nothing. During the good times, nothing can damage Bitcoin’s spirit. But for most of the time, bitcoiners are a bunch of namby-pamby worry-warts who wet their pants over everything._
_The Bitcoin world is neurotic in the way that fear dominates it. If there is not enough merchant adoption to satisfy them, they worry about hoarding and a liquidity crunch. If there is too much, they worry about downward selling pressure. If Bitcoin adoption happens too quickly, they complain about volatility and bubbles, and if it happens too slowly, they complain that no one cares about Bitcoin. If the financial world ignores Bitcoin, people worry that people are not interested, and if it pays attention, people worry about regulation._
_I find it unbelievable how consistently the Bitcoiners reinterpret everything good as some kind of problem. The Silk Road is bad for Bitcoin’s image, as if Bitcoin needs to worry about image. Bitcoin’s volatility—a reflection of its extraordinarily rapid growth—is seen as something that will make Bitcoin unrespectable. Bad press of any kind is feared, when with Bitcoin there is almost no such thing as bad press._
_Every month or two, a new crisis emerges. Mt Gox dies and it’s going to destroy Bitcoin. China bans Bitcoin and it’s going to destroy Bitcoin. A mining pool gets too much hashing power and it’s going to destroy Bitcoin! Every so often a new supervillain jumps up from under a rock. Not long ago, Mike Hearn was going to destroy Bitcoin. with redlists and Then there was the legion of evil behind CoinValidation, who wants to track all Bitcoin users. Recently Ben Lawsky has emerged as the latest moustache-twirler out to destroy Bitcoin with his bitlicense superweapon._
_The idea that anyone could ban Bitcoin is a joke. Any attempt to do so would be monumental hubris. As if the police are somehow going to stop people from carrying private keys around and connecting to the internet. Bitcoin is too useful for people to worry about whether it is legal or not, and it is also too useful for government agents to put a serious effort into trying to stop it._
_You know what’s going to destroy Bitcoin? Nothing, that’s what. Maybe a nuclear war or a giant meteor could do it, but not much else. The problem with Bitcoiners is that they think Bitcoin is fragile when it is really antifragile. It is no coincidence that Bitcoin keeps surviving every crisis. It survives because it is immortal._
_As long as there is profit to be made in the Bitcoin network, Bitcoin will mow down attackers. For every outside force which threatens Bitcoin, there are many internal forces building the tools required to counter it. These countermeasures aren’t necessarily always visible in the news, but everyone in Bitcoin has the incentive to protect their investment, and therefore has the incentive to develop tools to counter any problem. The sum effect of all these invisible innovators is that Bitcoin acts like an aikido master to deflect and absorb the forces that act against it._
_This all requires a little bit of faith to keep in mind because one has to believe in something that is not always visible, based on the rational expectation of its existence. But this is not so different from ordinary life: we know that the news gives us a biased sample of reality and we know that we must pay attention to what is seen and unseen. The only difference is how extreme the Bitcoin world is, how much pure FUD there is everywhere, both innocent and deliberate. This has to do with the fact that the Bitcoin economy changes so rapidly in scope and nature, that it is difficult to keep up with what is real and easy to get away with telling falsehoods._
_Bitcoiners, take a chill pill. Any time something happens, think to yourself, “How likely is it anything happening now is going to matter a month from now?” The answer will nearly always be “not at all”. You are sitting on perhaps the most wonderful secret one might expect to find in this mundane world and yet you can’t find a moment of contentment. Sit back, close the web browser, have a nice glass of wine, and then take a long nap._

I think acceptance is skipping ahead.
What gives bitcoin value is scarcity and usefulness.
If everyone could make bitcoin without a "proof of work", basically just be able to type into their computer "Give me 1,000,000 bitcoin" and your wallet showed a million bitcoin, bitcoin would not be scarce, and no one would want it; hence its value would be zero (no acceptance).
If bitcoin was scarce, but had no mechanism to trade it (no blockchain, no "payment network"), it wouldn't be useful;  hence its value would be zero and no one would want it (no acceptance).
So while I agree with you that acceptance gives it value, I think the more important reason why bitcoin has value is that it is scarce and useful.

Bitcoin with increased user adoption becomes deflationary.  Therefor, when having to decide on which currency to use between a fiat, inflationary currency and a deflationary one; you will naturally choose the inflationary currency (Thier's Law).

In my mind, the market would encourage the population to own and transact with bitcoin. After the popularity increases and _x_ % own bitcoin, the govt would set into motion a plan to get rid of the debased paper currency by allowing a set % of the populations taxes (and other proceeds generated (govt run businesses)) to be paid in bitcoin.
Once the govt has a reliable and steady stream of bitcoin intake, they would keep increasing the % they allow taxes and other intake to be paid in bitcoin, until finally, the Fiat would be phased out completely. The price would stabilize after each successive increase.  Once the govt supply is safe, they would allow for direct fiat-&gt;bitcoin exchange.
Edit: once the supply is safe, the govt employees would also be paid % of salary in bitcoin. 
Edit2: after reading other replies, everyone keeps imagining a huge country shifting currencies in a day. That wont happen. It will start when a poor country with the proper elements in place's (electricity,internet,educated people,smart phones) population starts using bitcoin _en masse_. This country will go through the phases i describe in a specific timeframe (accellerated or not).. Most likely, an economic crisis will strike the first world, and this country that adopted bitcoin would stand unaffected.  Other 3rd world/2nd world countries will see this then follow their roadmap. The first world will fight this tooth and nail, but gradually adopt it.

Hey OP, you make a great point.
For anyone here that signed up for the Circle invite only beta, they gave you $10 in bitcoin or something (I forgot how much they gave me) but an **incrediblly cool thing they did was, right when you logged in and saw you had so and so much bitcoin, they had a link called _spend it_ that took you to a list of actual ITEMS you could purchase in a few clicks**
Basically changetip devs/owners, **sell these on-ramps to businesses**.  Tell Overstock, pay us $100 a month and we will place your products in the "spend it" list.

negatives 
centralized mining
micro transactions are difficult because the fees are computed by number of transactions needed to fill the output transaction
personal computers are hard to keep virus free for the non technical user therefor hard to keep safe (grandmas dont know how to make paper wallets)
exchanges that market themselves as banks have little to no oversight (take the money and run like empty Gox)
bitcoin is engineered to not only be better money (defeats every known money in a pure feature by feature comparison) but has a built in, trustless payment system that is cheaper by an order of magnitude to competing payment networks
can be sent to anyone, anywhere, no permission needed by anyone.  
There is no central organization to trust users only trust the cryptography, the same cryptography that protects our nuclear arsenals.  
The minting of the coin is steady, predictable, cannot be increased or decreased in quantity and IS scarce; there will ONLY EVER BE 21 million period.

First off, thanks for the tip!  Largest I ever received and I promise to pass it on.
Your analogy regarding the hydrogen bomb and its theoretical devastating  effects compared to its actual effect is appropriate.  It is quite an interesting thought experiment to try and put yourself in Hank Paulson's shoes and try and "solve" the crisis that he helped create back in 2007.  
A person who possesses a certain amount of intelligence fed the flames of the financial crisis and this same person who fueled the crisis was the person who was assigned to solve it.
The result is a short-sighted "hack" where he injects trillions of dollars into the financial system; economists tell him this will debase the currency, so he tells the banks not to spend it (at this point, both you and I realize this man is trying to fill shoes that are an order of magnitude too large for him to fill).
So he basically wants the cake in addition to being able to eat it (inflate supply without paying a price).  This essentially creates a stairway rising higher and higher and higher; where other countries are debasing their currencies slowly (a stairway with a gradual decline), the united states, as an extension of Hank Paulson and the Bush Jr posse's inflated egos, not only wants to stave off a depression, they want the economy to display growth.
This will result, in my opinion, the burning up of the atmosphere by that hydrogen bomb.  The staircase is so high at this point the fall is tremendous.
As you say, the reality is, dramatic collapses do not often happen and I may be wrong, but history is on my side.  Believing anything otherwise is more religious than scientific.
In regards to Bitcoin being able to take the heat, I really dont know.  I think your right, we are certainly not ready as of this moment.  The user-interfaces are still too complex and trust is not easy to come by.  The transactions per second problem and the distrust that arises from mining centralization.
But i am constantly amazed at how fast people will adapt when they have a good reason to.  Considering the common man's options when the Black Swan occurs, I think Bitcoin adoption is inevitable.

I understand, almost all exchanges and online stores do this because they _can_.  They know you are sitting comfortably at a desk, shopping.  They do not think its unreasonable to wait 20 minutes.

_Critics claim that Bitcoin's inherent anonymity_
Anyone that has researched Bitcoin knows that Bitcoin is inherently transparent and not anonymous.   
Unless you get bitcoin locally (face to face) or have mined it yourself, you bought it from an exchange that probably has at least your first name/last name and a nice picture of your face.  Or your email address that you probably used in a lot of places that have your real information.
Now, the exchange has the payout address they sent your bitcoins to.  With this address they trace it *everywhere*
Bitcoin is not _inherently_ anonymous.  Bitcoin is _inherently_ transparent and requires a lot of work to make it anonymous. (I believe this is a good thing)

No.  An altruistic system would be too weak.

legal tender laws certainly work to an extent but soon there would be services that would automatically exchange your "sound money"(bitcoin) into the "fiat" money(your coin) (it would be fiat if it was centrally controlled and not backed by a scarce resource).
If people have the choice of which currency to use, they would probably use this fiat currency and hold the sound money so by that measure, yes it probably would be successful (government forces it on us).
Its my belief that if the macroeconomics of your currency was modeled around how we conduct the economy today, the boom bust cycles would drive people to use Bitcoin, and unlike gold, Bitcoin's properties make it so using anything else would just be illogical and tedious.
Remember, every depression we have, wealth moves into gold.  So much so where the united states made it a "crime" in 1933 to hoard it.  The difference today is, when we move to digital gold when the next bust occurs, the government has no means by which to take it away from us **and** there is no real reason to not keep using it as a medium of exchange (whereas, when the economies stabilized, gold was then exchanged to currency to exchange for daily living items.)
@_date: 2014-10-28 11:28:43
Does this apply to exchanges that dont actually hold keys?
Lets say an exchange is just one of the many signatures required for the actual transmission of a private key in a transaction and does not hold the actual key.
So an exchange's job is to match seller to buyer, but acts as a "pseudo" escrow service (pseudo because it never holds the key).
Will this exchange that merely matches seller to buyer a money transmitter?

There are two kinds of deflation. One is just the currency getting more valuable. The other is deflation due to everyone having to stop and pay down their debts.  Deflation due to debt is horrible and is not the deflation associated with bitcoin.  England experienced financial stability that has been described as unprecedented in the later half of the 19th century into the 20th.  You should read the book *Deflation:  Current and Historical Perspectives.
It describes the short periods where some economists blame financial instability due to deflation.  "Periods of price disturbances are periods of industrial and financial disturbance and social unrest.  Practically never one without the other.  And periods of price stability are periods of industrial and social equilibrium and sanity." 
Basically, more often than not, social instability or outside forces cause disturbances in financial systems and not the deflationary nature of the economic system of the time.
You say 
"you're up for buying milk and eggs with bitcoin, but how much milk and eggs do you need"
I hope I do not offend, but this is a ridiculous statement.  A person wants the amount of milk and eggs to satiate his/her self and household.  Whether using bitcoin or the dollar, i attest the amount would be the same.  I believe no one walks into a supermarket and reduces the amount of eggs he/she buys when their current financial situation is _stable_ (has financial security whether it be bitcoin or dollars).
Furthermore, I believe a person holding disproportionately large amounts of buying power (whether in dollars or bitcoin) that wants to buy a boat will buy a boat.
Your analogies to the middle ages are erroneous in that bitcoin can be compared to gold only to a degree.  Understand that bitcoin, the currency, was _modeled_ around a commodity like gold but was given additional attributes to allow it to be used as currency (cash).  Gold cannot be split into a millionth of an ounce easily and bartered with on a daily basis, instantly around the world.  Bitcoin cannot be counterfeit unlike gold that was sometimes filled with tungsten.  
In the middle ages, the buying demographic would be changed completely when the world's population was the potential buyer of any good or commodity you might sell.  And the hoarders would get what they want, a serious price increase due to dwindling supply.  But do you see the error in context yet between bitcoin and gold?  The scarcity would simply increase bitcoin's market value and the remaining bitcoin in the market would be divided up into smaller parts and traded.  The boom in price would release more of the commodity into the market as some hoarders sold at the price boom, lowering the price, rinse and repeat.
To go back to the beginning of my post, I want to remind you that there is good deflation and bad deflation.  I believe the difference is what confuses most people when judging bitcoin, the (good) deflationary currency.

Just in case..CopyPasta
Recently the CEO of GAW Miners claimed publicly that the company and he personally have sealed up partnerships and deals with Target, Amazon, and Walmart about the coin and the company.
Josh also made a claim in an interview with CCN about Authy that they were single-handedly stress testing the Authy service because the requests are so high and outperforming other Authy users,




Earlier this week, Authy called us and said our users were stressing their network. Authy is an amazing company. Turns out ZenCloud users are pinging Authy for more 2FA requests than any other company in the space. Even more than CoinBase and CEX.io received communication from Authy.
Coin Fire has learned these recent claims are stretching the truth or outright lies.
At the Hashers United Conference in Vegas Josh made the bold claims about Walmart, Target, and Amazon, and our news team immediately began working to confirm the claims. After several weeks of back and forth between the legal teams and public relations teams at one of the companies we have finally received four on-the-record statements and a bold statement from one of the four companies legal teams.
Walmart confirmed via spokesperson Tara Greco that Walmart has no relation with GAW Miners, PayCoin or any project that Josh Garza or GAW Miners is involved with issuing the following statement to Coin Fire,


Target also confirmed to our team that much like Walmart it has no relation to paycoin, or GAW Miners with a spokesperson telling our editorial team,


Amazon went one step further with having an unnamed source at the company’s legal department tell us that,


The official statement from an Amazon spokesperson was just as telling if less bold reading,




While Josh is declaring publicly and implying a partnership with all three companies it would seem that all three are disavowing any sort of partnership. We have reached out to GAW Miners for a statement about these statements but once again the company has repeatedly denied our staff a statement.
Two members of the Authy team offered the following comments to Coin Fire about Josh’s statements to CCN.


— Daniel Palacio, Founder of Authy, Inc.
This statement was followed up by a statement from the President and COO of the company, Marc Boroditsky:






So while the company stated the use has genuinely increased it did offer comments that they wouldn’t give details to one client about performance versus other clients. To do so would likely cause a sticky situation for the company as Coinbase and GHash likely wouldn’t take kindly to the remarks.
After our site’s previous concerns about GAW Miners and the company’s failure to give a statement we immediately dropped all GAW Miners advertisements from our site.
As this feature went to editing a listing for Hashlet had gone live on Amazon. It should be noted though it is not being sold directly by Amazon but rather a third-party vendor. With the remarks from Josh Garza recently it would seem he is implying a direct partnership and this listing to the untrained eye would seem that way — but is not any sort of partnership with Amazon as a spokesperson had made clear to Coin Fire.
Coin Fire has reached out multiple times for comments on this story and a response from GAW Miners before publishing this article. If Josh Garza and GAW Miners can give complete evidence that any of the companies he has before mentioned are entering a BONAFIDE partnership and said company is willing to go on the record we will update this story. However, at this time, each company has OUTRIGHT DENIED each of Garza’s statements.

Dont invest based on that, I just think its gonna happen.
The chaotic nature of markets is chaotic because our tiny brains cant understand their complexities.  What we see is the event itself (in this case a x10 price rise).
Suddenly the Winkelvoss ETF hits, Jersey investors buy pressure leaks onto exchanges, adoption rates increase tremendously etc.. Suddenly the price rises x10 and this comment is linked.  The responders say "There is no way investors could have foreseen the x10 price increase.."

1)  Visa and the big banks see profits in the billions and it takes week(s) to send money across borders.  Visa and big banks and payment processors have money, but the regulation and oversight prevents the money from translating into ANY functional improvements so that part of your statement needs to be reviewed again.  A bank's idea of innovation is ordering transactions so a customer gets charged multiple overdrafts by putting the _big transaction_ first.
The abstract way we throw hashpower at cryptography problems to secure our network and verify transactions is actually very sound and architecturally elegant.  Power costs will decrease over time and technologies will improve.  Also, the cryptography within bitcoin can be upgraded if there ever comes a time where the two types of cryptography in bitcoin is not deemed secure enough.
2)  I dont understand your second point.  I think you might be asking why would people invest in bitcoin services/infrastructure when they could just invest in the coin itself?  Most likely because people think their good/service will outperform the currency value.

 (connect to your bank account)
In Europe, 
 (instant with credit card but cc cash withdrawal fees applies-if your debit/credit card can "pass their scrutiny" )
 (SEPA/SOFORT and regular cash transfer (4-5 days))
The list I have just shown you are the **only** exchanges I personally **trust** and I have tried over a dozen exchanges (got burned on 2)

When you give Bitcoins away, you are accepting its current price (you are voting "yes" to the current price).
Holding creates a higher price (value) which increases demand.  
Hodling is the easy answer to what you should do to help Bitcoin because it increases its value.
Why do you want more value?  Increasing Bitcoin's value increases its utility.  A tiny country could not conduct trade using bitcoin now (5 billion dollar market cap) because Bitcoin does not have the liquidity to do something as simple as satiate a tiny nations electricity needs.

Regulation did not put silk road out of business, police did.
Regulation does not stop child porn, police stop child porn.
No one says there shouldn't be laws that prohibit people from commiting acts of violence.  The financial system should be a tool that gives us a medium of exchange and provides us with mechanisms to store our wealth.  
If laws are violated they should be persecuted to its full extent.  There is no sarcasm in these statements.
Governments co-opting financial mechanisms (controlling of currencies into and out of borders) may prevent a dozen crimes but potentially disenfranchises millions (billions?)
Think of the impoverished of africa and asia.  Do these people not possess an entrepreneurial spirit?  Are we the "chosen few" who like to build things?  Or is it because we have built a system that is not inclusive rather, the opposite, exclusive for the people geographically born on a certain side of a border.
No, I believe a perfect financial system is agnostic to matters of law.  The system we build today uses buzz terms, FUD, that slowly pulls our liberties away as threads to a tapestry.  We do not need governments to tell us that child porn is wrong.  We know child porn is wrong.  
Walk out onto the street and declare your love for child porn.  Start a thread on a decentralized forum declaring your love for child porn.  These are your neighbors downvoting you.  
There will be a posse coming after you.  Every father that has a chance to get you into a room with steel wrench will take that chance to persecute you.  These are your neighbors.
Do we need these chosen few in government to convince you that child porn is wrong?  These few people that can be targeted and completely co-opted?  Or will the markets regulate themselves and do an infinitely better job at it.
My point is that it is downright arrogant to think a chosen few people have the passion or time to understand the intricacies of any market; the inherent flaw is that the motivations of these entities do not align with the market they are regulating.  
Its interesting I am posting these thoughts here on a Bitcoin forum, because what I am expressing is the "decentralization" of the markets.  The markets are complex, and it is arrogant and flawed to think any central entity could regulate a market without completely fucking it up.

mining alts or btc?  because if you are mining btc, sorry :( that wont really work mate.
Its great you did though!  Nearly all of us "veterans" started off by mining.  It leads to better understanding.
Right now bitcoin is mined by professional miners that have factories of ASICS (application specific integrated circuits) that are designed specifically for SHA-256.
This expresses the incredible security the bitcoin network provides compared to other coins.  If you are able to mine "a lot" of coins with a normal computer, understand this is a symptom of a problem with that coin (lack of security).  
Imagine if a hacker had a botnet of 10,000 machines and was able to minerd the crap out of a coin, owning the network with no cost?
So ye, have a great time mining, but I suggest mining a coin that has a good exchange rate with BTC and just exchanging it.  Its better than waking up in the morning and seeing .000001 BTC for a full nights of electricity :)
Good luck!

4.8 trillion dollars was injected into the market to prop up the top 5 investment banks after the 2007/08 economic crisis.
Do you know what the economic crisis was about?  
I will simplify it.  
Banks used to give loans to people based on whether or not they could pay it back. In the 2000s, they instead gave everyone loans mostly to people who never should receive a loan (practically no possible way to pay it back).   
Investment banks used something called financial derivitives to package up these loans into something called a CDO (derivitive) and allowed investors to "bet" on them.  
What gives these cdos value is their "rating" (A,AA,AAA etc).  Rating companies wouldnt get paid unless they gave high ratings to these crap cdos.
So basically, thats like you saying to credit rating agencies, every time someone asks for my credit rating, I will pay you $1000 if you say it is good, $100,000 if you say it is great and ZERO if you say its anything but those. 
So these CDOs (which are destined to fail because, these poor people put zero money into the house for example, so any trouble = boom bankruptcy walk away see ya thx) were destined to fail.  And the investment banks actually took out insurance (via companies like AIG) policies where WHEN they fail (they undoubtedly would) the investment banks would make tons of money (they literally banked on it).    
So now, these CDOs start collapsing, AIG cant pay out, the walls crumble, these investment banks (50% of the economy in derivitive facing investment) are facing bankruptcy and a huge nuclear explosion type collapse occurs (2008).
The federal reserve printed 3.5 trillion dollars (the US national debt is 14.4 trillion) to prop up these companies that should be dead and buried based on darwinistic market forces.  Millions lost their homes and jobs and their livelihood.  No one went to jail.  But surely we then regulated these investment banks to stop this?  No.  Nothing.
There has been no regulation to stop them since.
Fast forward to today.
The fed keeps pumping money into these companies that, as I said should be corpses, via QE.
**The top 5 investment banks that were the criminals of 2008 have 40 trillion dollars in exposure to derivatives today**  
If that doesnt make your jaw drop.  TRILLION. The entire US national debt is 14 trillion.
So ye, if you stop QE, the entire house of cards collapses, and if they try to "print" their way out of it again?
Heloooooooo Bitcoin.  Because that dollar isnt worth ANYTHING anymore.  You cannot print 40 TRILLION dollars.  you just cannot do it.  You can, but then your currency is worth less than dog shit.

Ive said it over and over again, if you spend your bitcoin, you are not helping the price.
**When you spend bitcoin you are casting a vote stating "This price is the right price for Bitcoin"**
When you hold, it is harder for others to get it.
If you care about price, hold Bitcoin, because when you spend it at least 50% of what you spend gets hitched to the BTC value wagon, increasing its weight and slowing it down (downward buy pressure).
If you spend, then re-buy, at least theoretically, this keeps the price the same but why use precious bitcoin when you could use worthless paper.
In your own mind, you tell yourself "If I spend, this merchant will say 'hey, we are getting a lot of bitcoin business!  this is great!'" You think this will get other merchants aboard, it might.  It probably does (enter Microsoft).  
Ok you hooked the biggest fish in the pond, hows the price doing?

Those examples certainly did not assume this.
The examples he gave described broadcasting **transactions** to one or 10 or a million listeners that just publish the transactions.  These transactions do not necessarily have to be _owned_ by the broadcaster at all.
Think of a "rebel group" in a dystopian future that used Bitcoin in their little village.  They have no communication to the outside world.
Once a month one guy gets their local database of 4000 transactions that took place in the village, drives his jeep across a wastleland to a broken down tv station.  He hooks up his laptop to the modified tv satellite dish and bursts the transactions to "big city".  In big city, there are 12 "listeners" that supply this service to the rebels (underground).  They take the transactions and add them to the blockchain.
What Andreas is trying to express I believe, is that money is like a "content type".  It can be "pushed" out just like your browser doesnt care if u type into the address line "c:\\myhomepage.html" or   Your browser just reads the content and detects "&lt;html&gt;" and starts processing it.
Bitcoin is like that.  Money is now a content type.  The content of a Bitcoin message contains no "sensitive data" so u can just push it anywhere you want.  You dont care who sees it cause theres nothing to hide.  


And the digital signature of the transaction initiator (correct me if I am wrong)


The "receiver" is just a Bitcoin full node.


The "sender" can send a million transactions or 1 or anything in between to the bitcoin network.

Not to be a glossy eyed optomist but, the scenarios you describe will not only be solved by innovations, but will make their competing solutions look absolutely infantile.
Think of dying and your money gets programatically sent to your inheritors based on certain conditions that are non-negotiable contrary to todays system where an asshole sibling can sue others to change YOUR DYING DECLARATIONS.
Think of a thief breaking into your safe, getting away with what he thinks is your money on a usb disk but finding he cannot spend it due to it requiring 2/3 signatures.
Think of a peer to peer auctionhouse where the 3rd signature is the little machine the UPS guy carries around, where the funds are released to the seller after you sign your name. INSTANTLY.
This idea of recourse is todays "thats why it wont succeed" buzzword.  
It is not worth debating and most likely will turn into a "bikeshed" moment where they drag you down into detail without looking up from their checklist of "why this wont work".

As a long term supporter of Bitcoin, the one thing I question is exactly the attribute that makes Bitcoin so desirable;  its deflationary properties.
In the past, deflationary gold backed currencies resulted in huge outflows of gold from countries that imported more than it exported.
The complexity of the market is such that it almost causes me to involuntarily reach out for something, anything, to grab on to (monetary levers) to at least give me the semblance of control.
Now personally, with my own bitcoin supply, I am absolutely smitten with the idea of my savings potentially going up in value; but on a macroeconomic level, it is quite "scary".  
In a world with 200 fiat currencies + 1 currency that is equivalent to gold; everyone from banker to king to sovereign states will covet it, desire it, kill for it any way they can.  This scenario could get quite scary.
If Bitcoin becomes an international settlement/clearing house mechanism, imagine a US aircraft carrier getting refueled in the Pacific and the Phillipines will only accept Bitcoin for the fuel.  This is the type of power/pull Bitcoin would have if Bitcoin "succeeds"

To add to this, and thanks for this post it was very good, is that if you use a scalpel and remove the currency from the blockchain, you are removing the incentive for miners to perform security ($500,000,000 worth of security).

Based on history, the "International Central Bankers" that control our governments in the west corner the gold/silver markets (taking the gold away from both governments and citizens)(not as much silver because many citizens still hold a portion) right before they crash the markets.  It is a "currency control" of sorts.  When they crash the markets (intentionally, fed highers the interest rates contracting the money supply), the gold price is increased (sometimes astronomically).
The water is receding.. Get to high ground.
Edit:  this time around it will be interesting.  Confiscating gold/silver is one thing.  But now we have another vehicle to escape these artificial boom and bust cycles that are manufactured by the federal reserve.

Yes, if the dollar crashes the US is screwed.  They still have the most elite military in the world, so the definition of screwed may be different depending how u look at it.


Yes they probably would act against it.  If they banned it, they would just be even more screwed.  They would drive all the businesses out of the US and into Canada or wherever they embrace Bitcoin.  Remember, the dollar crashed at this point so.. The middle east and other oil producers would not be taking dollars for their oil anymore.  The US would not be a financial powerhouse, so businesses wouldn't need to be US based to be successful.


Bitcoin does not want to take over.  It is neutral.  **It isn't trying to be better than other currency.**  **It is better than other currency** (it was designed to be so).  Think of Neo in the Matrix after he realizes he does not have to play by the rules anymore.  Bitcoin is better than any other fiat currency, the market forces will gravitate towards it no matter how much "artificial pressure" is created to fight it.  Bitcoin renders fiat currency obsolete due to its inherent properties being better.    
We are not fighting other currencies because there is no fight, we already won;  they just need some time to realize it.

Great post.  And regarding proof of work, the idea and implementation has been scrutinized by many intelligent people in the industry and attempts to improve the concept are ongoing.  
To a layman, proof of work _works_ in practice, but the reason why it is working is what troubles many in the bitcoin space often becoming emotional rants.
The canyon dividing a thought experiment and a functioning system is large, and the reasonable people will mostly stand with the working system.

Yes I agree, but moreso to the point, the unit of currency of bitcoin is far more important to the blockchain than email was to the internet.
Removing the market value of bitcoin would make the blockchain completely un-secure thus rendering the blockchain useless.
So I agree, but the value bitcoin the currency brings to the blockchain is powers of magnitude more important to the blockchain than email was to the internet I think.

So in 120 years, Bitcoin will reach its cap.
The unit that is **really used** is called the satoshi.
There are 100 MILLION satoshis in 1 Bitcoin.
This means that if 2 BILLION people are using bitcoin there would be 1 MILLION coins each (if divided equally among us which wont be the case)
Dont listen to the trolls who try and use 21 million as a limitation.  
**21 million's only limitation is the imagination of the troll.**
Satoshi Nakamoto has predicted technological advances against the timeline of the resource needs of the Bitcoin system in an almost Nostradamus like fashion.  
He _knew_ bandwidth would increase at a specific rate and allowed the blockchain to bloat.  
He _knew_ "specialized mining hardware" ala ASICS would come about and blow up the difficulty.
He _knew_ (I think correctly) that Bitcoin needed an incubation period or it would get destroyed (when he asked WikiLeaks to please NOT accept Bitcoin donations)
Satoshi predicts that the Bitcoin price will increase to a point where _dust_ is actually a healthy amount of buying power (in the next 100 years).
So ye, in 120 years, Satoshi thinks maintenance fees are good enough and I tend to trust the genius behind this invention more than thought experiments by laymen.

Bitcoin is digital cash
Edit: to be clear, it's important to understand that bitcoin is digital cash.  Just as in the early 1900s citizens conducted business via cash, bob hands Alice $322 to pay his monthly apartment rent, Bitcoin is digital cash.
Comparing it to credit cards or PayPal is a bad analogy.  Credit cards and PayPal can be built on top of Bitcoin just as it was built on top of cash.
Bitcoin is the cash foundation needed to build a more fair, efficient and robust financial system.  It is the foundation. Services like credit/charge backs will be built on top.
My father owned a women's clothing store.  He always loved it when customers paid cash.  Credit card companies fees were too high and didn't always pay out. 
For the same reason, businesses will most likely prefer you paid Bitcoin directly to them in the future instead of it being processed through this "yet to be invented" payment processor that provides charge backs.
By the same token, that unease you feel walking down that city street with $2300 in your wallet is the same unease you should feel when holding 10 Bitcoin on your desktop in your un-passworded Bitcoin core wallet.
Bitcoin is cash. When you watch oceans 11 and see a vault full of cash, that boner you get, that no questions asked wealth at your fingertips.  That is the same boner you would get if you saw your wallet suddenly receive 20,000 btc.
Bitcoin is cash. Digital cash. Everyone wants cash.

By that logic, when Bitcoin had no market price, it held no value to the people transacting in it.  Had that epiphany yet?  
The term 'Intrinsic Value' itself is stupid.  All value is subjective to the person viewing it.
Edit:  And if you are viewing Bitcoin as some static digital coin sitting in empty space without the network, you are missing 'Bitcoin' in it's entirety.  Bitcoin and its network (which is a part of Bitcoin) is probably going to be the greatest invention ever created (how's that for 'intrinsically having value'). &lt;---this is the part most economists who only superficially research Bitcoin miss.

I have always been under the impression that these exchanges that allow ridiculous leveraging are completely corrupt.
I am not an economist, I am a 20+ year computer programmer and have written software that moves Bitcoin/experiments with Bitcoin and it would be quite trivial, in my mind, to "fake" volume in either direction to force margin calls if I were the totalitarian owner of an exchange.
I am curious if you believe that your loss was completely "bad luck"?  Lack of experience? Or do you, too, have suspicions about the integrity of the exchange itself?

1 BTC is kind of a lot to put on your mobile :)  But I had 1 btc in there a while back.
If you have a pc, it may be wiser to download armory or multibit or mycellium.  Personally, I use multibit just because that was the first one i started using years back. 
Basically, your breadwallet has a bitcoin address.  You can get this by swiping left on the screen.  The new screen will read "receive money" and below, in blue text, will be your bitcoin address.
Touch this and it will list 3 options:
copy to clipboard
send as email
send as message
Send it to your own email or however you want.  This address is your universally unique **public** address.  The entire world can send u money with this address.
In coinbase, withdraw your BTC to that address and you will receive btc there.
Paste it here and I can send you btc right now to check if it works :)
edit:  I read below that you plan on buying monthly, definitely do not store that on your phone dude.  Anything happens to your phone it is all lost.  I cannot emphasize the following enough:  **if you lose your private key your money is gone.  there is no "recover password".  You are going to receive cash, like a $400 paper bill (only digital) and if you drop it or lose it, thats it.  bye bye** Breadwallet has a phrase you should write down, and I guess you could recover your funds with that phrase but having large amounts on your phone is not wise.  If anyone gets through the 4 digit security protection they can just send your btc to their own address.
Get one of the desktop wallets I have listed above and get one of those USB memory sticks.  backup the bitcoin wallet onto a usb stick (look into paper wallets but i dont want to scare you with complexity) and put that usb stick in a safe or safety deposit.  Physically secure it.  Mycellium and armory wallets allow you to back it up once then store it.  And every month, the entirety of your balance will be on that usb backup.  so if your house burns down, in the safety deposit box sits your bitcoin.  so if a burglar steals your computer, u can quickly grab the usb and recover the btc (transfer it to another address)

Price fixing is not new and has been done with precious metals since its inception as a medium of trade and store of value.
What you describe is cornering the market.  You could not possibly do this (unless you were willing to come up with a little over a billion dollars).
Understand, it is game theory at play here.  Even if you had 80% of the market, the 1% would undercut the shit out of you.  Then, since money is a serious mans game, the undercutting would happen at an avalanche pace driving the price down "to where it should be".
Price discovery of any commodity is an extremely complex "animal".  As a matter of fact, I am an economic newb, but have watched and read alot about the libertarian/anarcho-capitalist points of view since getting into bitcoin; and I get a strong feeling that the ideologies behind these libertarian views are based on the belief that the complexities surrounding price discovery are so extreme that no centralized entity is capable of setting it.
So basically, trying to artificially create a price for bitcoin (or any commodity) is nearly impossible since a commodities price will "constantly push itself towards its actual price".  Therefor you will be expending your resources (money and time) pushing against this invisible monster of a force pushing against you.
Whale day traders can do this for tiny windows of time, but as I said, the price will always gravitate towards its actual price;  which is a force to be reckoned with.

The Mongols were like anyone else: they liked their bling. The Silk Road was the lifeline of the empire. Spices, pearls, cotton, and lapis lazuli (a blue gem), came from India and Central Asia. Europe supplied salt, furs and iron. China supplied the silks and fancy pottery. But the old Silk Road could be a dangerous place for caravans loaded with priceless goods. If the weather didn’t kill you then the bandits probably would.
 
The Mongols solved such problems by creating services stations, called yams, every twenty miles to protect travelers and provide a place to get a hot meal and place to lay your head. The yams were part motel, part post office, and part military barracks. They made traveling the Silk Road safe and efficient which is always good for business. It is said that in the time of the Mongol Empire a caravan loaded with gold could travel from one end of the Silk Road to the other without needing a bodyguard. And that is exactly how the Mongols wanted it. The Mongols also created the world’s first passport that travelers hung around their necks. Each passport was made of a different material engraved with a symbol that told how important the traveler was.

Create a public key from that.  Send your BTC to it, then delete all traces of it except the public key. (I use bitcoin core)
Your money is now in your head!
Edit:  this is not for everyone.  if you forget your phrase you lose all your money,  make sure you use an offline tool when generating the private key and have no keyloggers.  Never use words that are in any dictionary anywhere on earth.  Use mix cases and mispel everything :) create 2 wallets, put a small amount in one and use this if someone has a pipe to your head to give up your key.  test the wallet first before transferring large amounts to it.

The chances of Bitcoin actually obtaining a &gt; $20 market price is pretty much the chances of a meteor striking earth and releasing vicious Pokemon that enslave our women.
Bitcoin did that through a few miracles, hard work, sweat/tears, a strong community, dark markets, complex fraud, charities and most importantly, being engineered as a better money/store of value.
We are afraid of alts as much as we are afraid of horny alien Pokemon.

As someone who has constructed software solutions in oil and gas, banking and telecom, the worst thing you can do to Bitcoin is fix problems that do not exist yet.  If that happens, then the potential to introduce "fatal flaws" increases which would make me more cautious about Bitcoin's future.
Have a plan for "fixing" this if/when this becomes a problem, but do not introduce new code to production until it actually becomes a problem.
Debate the topic, get to the truth/solution is a reasonable response to the 1mb limit/tps issues.

QE is not causing inflation of consumer goods so the general public doesn't _feel_ the inflation of the money supply (usually increasing the cost of items) and this is intentional by the Federal Reserve.  They give out QE money to the big investment banks with the understanding that the banks will not release that money to the public (they do this by giving the money created a profit making interest rate (and most likely also ordering them not to))
Also this is why the dollar has gained strength (artificially) and the markets "appear" strong.  This is because the investment banks that received the money put that money either in their respective digital vaults to accrue interest OR invested the money in the stock market/hard commodities and of course the financial crash cancer called derivitives.
So ye, the fed used QE to allow for banks not to default in a "Minsky moment"* This money is "damned" up behind the walls of the major investment banks (the same criminal banks that caused the financial collapse in 2007-2008).  The cracks are appearing though, and game theory dictates that this money will come crashing into the system at some point in time.
When it does, the true value of the dollar will be **felt** by the average joe (consumer inflation and not just asset inflation).
This will be the Black Swan event that you describe.
_A **Minsky moment** is a sudden major collapse of asset values which is part of the credit cycle or business cycle. Such moments occur because long periods of prosperity and increasing value of investments lead to increasing speculation using borrowed money. The spiraling debt incurred in financing speculative investments leads to cash flow problems for investors. The cash generated by their assets no longer is sufficient to pay off the debt they took on to acquire them._ 
edit:  if you look closely at the countries that **use** qe money (they actually spend it on public works projects etc) these countries are causing inflation of consumer prices effectively devaluing their own currency.  The key thing to understand about the QE context of the USA is they are effectively preventing the big banks from spending the money that is given to them (allowing them to print the money, but since they dont use the money, inflation never appears).  The problem with this, its like other countries are slowly devaluing their currencies, but the USA will nuclear bomb crash when all the money is released at once.

I assure you, the only trigger you hit was the **logic** trigger.  If the rest of your post relies on a false statement, then it is just untruths.
See The Great Deflation in American History
_The Great Deflation occurred at the beginning of the period sometimes called the Second Industrial Revolution. It was characterized by dramatic increases in productivity made possible by the transition from agriculture to industrialization in the leading economies. The new leading industries were Bessemer and open hearth steel, railroads, the machinery industry, efficient steam shipping and animal powered agricultural mechanization. The prices of most basic commodities fell almost continuously; however, wages remained steady. Goods produced by craftsmen, as opposed to in factories, did not decrease in cost._
It was a period of growth.
Creating hypothetical situations where a person has a choice between using a bad currency and a good currency will of course result in the consumer **using the bad** (when the consumer has a choice, he will **get rid of** inflationary currencies) and **keeping the good**.
But a situation where the only medium of exchange is a deflationary currency results in growth, steady wages and decreased prices (See Great Deflation above); to say if a money's value usually increases so consumers will not use it is a fallacy.

Actually, bitcoin is inflationary at this moment and has inflated 16% this year.  Of course, if you set the adoption rate against the supply increase, bitcoin can be considered deflationary.

He then answers the question by stating the sheer size of the mining system (think millions of locusts blotting out the sky) will be such that 21 inc's mining pool will certainly "win" the bitcoin mining competition so often that they could include all 21 inc's transactions (maybe even blacklisting all others) at zero fee.
He then goes on to say, the satoshis mined will not be used for money, but probably something else;  like identity or ownership titles (like this phone is owned by Dave)

In my opinion
That Bitcoin we have in our pockets is the backbone of our future financial system, it is not the outward facing currency (unit of account).
Pricing things in Bitcoin doesnt make sense because, as Vitalik says, it will always be used for speculation since it is a scarce resource and thus its price will forever fluctuate (though the swings will be reduced with more liquidity).
My take on the future:  Bitcoin will "win" as a speculative investment after a 2nd/3rd world country's economy crashes and the government starts attempting to seize wealth of citizens;  these citizens escape via Bitcoin.  
As a thought experiment, imagine if you had a decent amount of wealth and the government started implementing capital controls that would result in 40-50% of your wealth being taken from you (even less than that).  How would you get your wealth out of the country or keep it in country but keep it safe?
We have parallels.  In South America, citizens buying cars or even extremely volatile stocks to save their wealth from seizure.
 
How about the Italian trying to escape with gold hidden in his car to escape new taxes?  
Good way to escape with your wealth?
Not really.
Dollars?  They are developing machines to "smell dollars" (not a joke)  
_A machine that can "smell" dollars - like a sniffer dog senses narcotics - is being developed._
_For the first time, chemists have captured the unique fragrance of US paper money._
Bitcoin may be a real alternative if/when a "bottom is found".  Bitcoin's volatility **does decrease* with every passing day. 
Many people say a killer app will be developed to make Bitcoin "mainstream" or various other reasons as to why Bitcoin will overtake the dollar as a medium of exchange.  I believe those who say this.  That 500 billion dollar industry of trade is ripe for the taking.
But it is the oft overlooked (maybe not by the facebook twins) **store of value** trillion dollar market where Bitcoin will make its first waves in my opinion.  When the Bitcoin price is $1,000,000 per BTC because multiple economies are crashing and the governments are trying to squeeze their respective populations of wealth is when merchants will store bitcoin and price in fiat (or an agile alt/sidechain coin).
Software solves volatility when you have 1 layer of abstraction.  Volatility is an illusion when you price in fiat and receive **gold** 2.0 (bitcoin).

I am not arguing, I am disagreeing.
If you are genuinely curious about your behaviour with Silver Dollars it is widely known in economic circles as **Thiers' Law**.
_If given the choice of what money to accept, people will transact with money they believe to be of highest long-term value. However, if not given the choice, and required to accept all money, good and bad, they will tend to keep the money of greater perceived value in their possession, and pass on the bad money to someone else._
Velocity of Bitcoin will only be zero if it is no longer useful as a store of value.  
The dollar exists, so Bitcoins price will increase (people will hoard it and not spend (**sell**) it (spending is selling)  to a point at which all other currencies are no longer accepted by merchants.
The government can try and ban its use, but that is a near theoretic impossibility (all governments around the world).  Bitcoin has no borders.
So basically we agree that having Bitcoins in the hands of a lot of people is good, but they will treat it like your silver dollars and hoard it until all the dollars are gone.
When dollars are gone (bad currency, any fiat that is not a finite resource) then Bitcoin's velocity will be _normal_
Edit:  The reason I disagree with you is your example assumes gold coins are the **only** currency in the market.
Assuming the peasants wouldnt buy food (lets say they were distributed 1 trillion pence which a gold coin was divided up into) with _pence_ is false and they wouldnt _demand_ anything from the king if the economy was growing and they had enough _pence_ to not only survive, but to experience a high standard of living.

Create a Bitcoin account at Blochain.info or any other web wallet (Circle, Coinbase or any trusted exchange)
Transfer the amount you want to pay him directly to the webwallet.  Wait 30 minutes for it to confirm etc, then immediately transfer it to the employee.
Do this every pay period.  Keep a zero balance on the web wallet in case the exchange goes belly up.
Your privacy is secure by doing this.

BTC is scarce, its velocity is incredibly high.
Its scarcity balances its velocity.
BTC will ONLY not have value if BTC is neither useful or scarce.
It really is as simple as that.  It's market price may be lowered because of its velocity, but if its adoption rate increases exponentially, its scarcity and demand will increase its price far more.
Stop thinking exchanges/overstock/xbox and start thinking smart refridgerators in 1 billion homes automatically ordering milk for you.  Start thinking smart robo accounting where legal documents/cash register debits are automatically placed on the blockchain for auditing.

Indeed, Bitcoin uses the square roots and cube roots of small primes.
It amazes me every time I think of the endless problems that would plague Bitcoin if the inventor wasn't so "forward thinking".
Many say that the only "blunder" Satoshi made was not "coding" around the "mine pooling" problem.  But even if that was his only blunder, we are still staring at a digital currency that is "good enough" decentralized and worth $200 per token.
I always say it is a miracle that Bitcoin even has a value above $1 given its complete lack of central backing (advertising, gorilla marketing).
Its value was built up organically which has proven to be a foundation that is much more robust and strong than any single solid pillar could have supported.

I trivialized Bitcoin a bit here by stating exactly one use case would cause a tipping point.
Our tipping point will occur when bitcoin hits multiple attack-vectors.  Bitcoin's tipping app will be hitting people left and right, the "so ez it looks like witchcraft" payment system, the ETFs will hit and wall street will be pumping the price and bitcoin will be taking bites out of gold, musicians will be taking it for their music, a video game (like minecraft) will popularize the currency by allowing it to be mined from within the game (dust) and in game trading/purchasing will make it go viral for that demographic..
So ye, I trivialized it a bit initially, but the "killer app" I think will be broad based.  There will be a flagship, I dont know which of the ideas (if any) will be that "flagship" killer app though.
And regarding "how do we make bitcoin payments at brick and mortar shops look like witchcraft", I dont know.  I know I want it.  I never said it was easy.

That is absolutely incorrect and stopped reading there.
People need to live and your idea that deflation is a bad thing is a fallacy that keynasians like to market to the sheeple.
_if one truly needs something, one buys it anyway, and what one does not truly need one should not buy at all. The buying what one does not need (overconsumption) is hollow with regard to economic growth, does not add value, and endangers the environment. Since deflation encourages one to buy only what one needs, it is actually a benign instrument in fighting overconsumption and environmental pollution. In a healthy economy that is in balance with the ecology, neither inflation nor deflation are desired, and the value of money should simply be constant._

bitcoin and namecoin are the only good coins out there as far as I see.

The point is, if Bitstamp receives this request, they would follow the pattern of other technology companies and warn their users.
I will not debate whether Bitstamps services are "brand new" or whether they would legally fall into the 2 year range because I think it is irrelavent.
The NSA wouldnt need to legally do any of this, because they could legally copy the information right off their servers (TAO actions are deemed legal in most cases).

Provide proof and our community would give you some amount of praise, without it; you really have hurt your reputation in a bad way.
I, and others with an IT background, interpret Peter Todd's quote as stating that Bitstamp's private information would be obtained by the NSA without you knowing because it is now stored on hardware you do not own.
And based on revelations by a certain x-NSA operative, there is evidence that this will indeed be the case.
So at least Peter Todd has evidence to back up his claim in the form of leaked NSA documents;  where is your evidence of his supposed blackmail?

Day trading or buying/selling every other month must be very difficult emotionally.
Understand a lot of us here are not speculators.  A lot of us (like me) are in it for the long haul and buy and hold.
We are engineers, information technology specialists (programmers, network admins), professors and scientists.  We buy because we see the architecture and believe its better.  We love the volatility because it doesn't effect us (we wouldnt sell anyways)
But ye, with such a low liquidity, manipulators are all over the place making a quick buck.

Wouldn't this solution be susceptible to, as Andreas Ant. says, "huge zombie armies".  Armies of PCs with latent viruses that exist today.
Some estimates say there are currently 2 million zombie nodes out there.  The "character" of the zombie leader is questionable (they are already the bad guy in the movie) so now we put them in charge of our money's security?
Unless you think the public can collectively overwhelm any power of a zombie army.  If this is the case, then the "zombie army" would actually strengthen security.
Regardless, it does sound very risky.

In addition, organizations or entities like governments tend not to ban something unless they have a chance to actually disrupt it in a meaningful way.
They lept at the chance to destroy all the centralized file sharing companies. When decentralized file sharing happened it took them years to act; and even when they did, the result was anemic at best.
Bitcoin is torrents except the incentive to mine/node/hold/lust after it is exponentially more powerful due to the fact it is an extremely valuable asset/money.

Which is our gain if you actually care about Bitcoin


Or saving it.  None of us know the right answer here so lets not feign wisdom.


That is absolutely ridiculous.  Money is a huge driving force in every one of our lives; to the point where it is almost an absolute truth that to find the cause of an event one can always follow the money to find the truth.
Roger Verr's "money" is Bitcoin.  This forum is called Bitcoin.  We are all here because we either "believe" in Bitcoin or selfishly want Bitcoin to succeed for monetary reasons.  
Either way, it is absolutely illogical (borderline crazy) to believe someone who has evangelized his money for the lifetime of holding that money is at the same time trying to destroy that money that gives him his quality of life.  Worst case, he is sincerely trying to help but taking the wrong path at which time we should trust that losing his entire fortune will pull him into a different camp.  And the same goes for the camp hes currently fighting if he is right(we are reasonable people I hope and not religious fanatics?)
This is just my opinion.  Think anything you want.  But please stop preaching your religion to us without concrete proof in the form of video of him pissing on satoshi or something.  Any proof other than that and your claims are frankly unbelievable.

"Hi Andreas, if you HAD to hard fork to raise the block size.  You HAVE to.  Would you recommend 2 mb or 8mb or unlimited (32mb)"

@_date: 2017-03-07 21:01:47
The reason Bitcoin'ers are concerned, is not because we think the CIA is directly targeting us; just that we protect our money digitally and we just found out the CIA can teleport into our personal bank vaults if we keep our money on our computer or smartphones (which many (all) of us do (in differing degrees)).
We also have paper wallets (were they watching when my private key was generated!?) and hardware wallets (this is safe)
@_date: 2017-03-06 13:09:02
Of course no one "has to" do anything.  But history shows we raised the blocksize limit every time we had to solve full blocks so it's not unreasonable to hypothesize we may do it again.
I just think, if we did raise it, 2mb is ridiculous because, like in the past, if we heal transaction congestion via raising blocksizes, we would hard fork again soon after since 1mb-&gt;2mb is a trivial increase.

@_date: 2017-03-10 09:36:59
Its freaking hard.  It is traceable.  The real question is, traceable to what.
Your example with Monero is just one way to obfuscate.  You can move out and into Bitcoin in a number of ways.  You can spam dust to 10000 addresses in differing amounts which is like someone trying to find you in a hall of 10,000 mirrors.
Plausible deniability lies at every transfer.  No one can prove you own any specific address (unless they can ie. y ou fucked up), they can only prove you owned it at somepoint in time.  A drug dealer owned that dollar bill in your pocket at some time in history, that does not make you guilty of dealing drugs does it?
So ye, that pseudo anonymity imo gets thrown around so often as a detriment to Bitcoin, but i do not believe blockchain forensics has come so far where someone who wants to hide their identity can be found.  Even that story from Denmark that stated they used the blockchain to capture criminals, I bet it was something stupid the criminals did (one way or another) and not because they developed a super algorithm for traversing the blockchain to establish identity.
The NSA will find you. They will. Your 1.74 BTC stash will get taken by the NSA/CIA if they want your 1.74 BTC stash in your Breadwallet.
But if your not the NSA.  If you cannot threaten this exchange to hand over all info regarding you, then take that info, threaten organization  for all transactions from this address, then tie together this public address you seized via your Silk Road raid..
If your not the NSA, you dont know who owns 1GGqwreU8G8bP24JSwGpr46iEQ4t7QMqvk and it is a fact that 99.99999% of things in this world are not the NSA

Ohh ye, welcome to Reddit week long account.  We hope you enjoy your stay.  Since you are new here is a quick explanation on what reddit is
Registering an account with Reddit is free and does not require an email address to complete. As of June 2015, there were 36 million user accounts.[21] When logged in, Reddit users (known as redditors) have the ability to vote on submissions and comments to increase or decrease their visibility and submit links and comments. Users can also create their own subreddit on a topic of their choosing, and interested users can add it to their frontpage by subscribing to it. For example, as of May 2015, the Wikipedia subreddit – subtitled "the most interesting pages on Wikipedia" – has over 151,000 subscribers.[22] Reddit comments and submissions are occasionally abbreviated and peppered with terms that are understood within (and in many cases also outside) the Reddit community, ranging from OP (for "original poster" – the user who posted the submission being commented upon) to NSFW (for "not safe for work" – indicating the post has graphic or sexually explicit content).[23] Users earn "post karma" and "comment karma" for submitting text posts, link posts, and comments, which accumulate as point values on their user profile. "Post karma" refers to karma points received from text and link posts, while "comment karma" refers to karma points received from comments. Users may also be gifted "Reddit gold" if another user has well received the comment or post, generally due to humorous or high-quality content; this process is known as "gilding." Reddit has also created a system of points called "creddits". Reddit gold "creddits" are like gift certificates: each creddit you have allows you to give one month of Reddit gold to someone else. The points do not lead to a prize as they are meant to stand in as a badge of honor for the user among their peers, although redditors have attempted to redeem their points before.[24]
Reddit also allows submissions that do not link externally. These are called "self posts" or "text submissions". Many discussion-based subreddits allow only text-only submissions such as "AskReddit" – where users are only allowed to pose broad, discussion based questions to the community at large. Self posts previously did not accumulate karma points for the submitter, but as of July, 2016, these text-only posts generate karma.[25]
Mister Splashy Pants logo used on November 27, 2007
Reddit communities occasionally coordinate Reddit-external projects such as skewing polls on other websites, such as in 2007 when Greenpeace allowed web users to decide the name of a humpback whale it was tracking. Reddit users voted en masse to name the whale "Mr. Splashy Pants", and Reddit administrators further encouraged this by changing the site logo to a whale during the voting. In December of that year, Mister Splashy Pants was announced as the winner of the competition.[26]
Within the site, redditors commemorate their "cake day" once a year, which is the anniversary of the day the user's account was first created. The "cake day" offers no special benefit, except that a small icon representing a slice of cake appears next to that user's name for 24 hours.[27] Redditors can "friend" one another, which gives a redditor quick access to posting and comments of their friend list. The commenting system and friend system, along with a certain "Reddit ethos" (called reddiquette on Reddit), lend Reddit aspects of a social networking service, though not to the extent of Facebook, Google+, and other websites aimed at providing social networking services. The Reddit community also socializes at meetups held at local parks and bars around the world,[28] and many localized subreddits for local in-person meetings exist.
Reddit entries are organized into areas of interest called "subreddits". Originally, the front page was the "main-reddit", and other areas were "subreddits". There is now no longer a single main-reddit. Instead, there are now 50 "default subreddits" dealing with topics such as books, television, and music, and thousands of additional non-default subreddits. The default subreddits are the 50 subreddits which are first recommended to new users to select from to appear on, or via their customizable top menu bars. All new users are initially automatically "subscribed to" the 50 default subreddits, but can then customize their "subscriptions."
Any registered user who has maintained an account for 31 days or more may create a non-default subreddit.[29] There are over 11,400 active total subreddits to peruse,[15][16][17] including the default set of 50 subreddits as of February 2016. The site has a default "Front Page" which contains staff selected popular articles, and also an "All Page" which contains only the very top ranked article/ subreddits as ranked by readers themselves, and which page is accessible via an "All" link at the top of the "Front Page."
In an interview with Memeburn, Reddit GM, Martin noted that the platform's "approach is to give the community moderators or curators as much control as possible so that they can shape and cultivate the type of communities they want".[30]
IAmA and AMA
One of the most popular subreddits is IAmA ("I Am A") where a user may post "AMAs" (for "Ask Me Anything"), or similarly "AMAAs" (for "Ask Me Almost/Absolutely Anything") – prompts for others to ask questions about any topic. AMAs are open to all Reddit users, and use the site's comment system for both questions and answers; it is similar to a press conference but online. This subreddit was founded in May 2009.[31] From 2013 to 2015, Victoria Taylor assisted reddit's volunteer community in presenting interviews.[32][33][34]
A number of notable individuals have participated in the IAmA subreddit, including United States President Barack Obama[35][36] (while campaigning for the 2012 election), Dave Grohl,[37] Madonna,[38] Chris Hadfield[39] (who answered questions from the International Space Station), Bill Gates,[40] Ron Paul,[41] Stephen Colbert,[42] Psy, Enya, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Rachel Maddow, Robin Williams,[43] Renée Fleming, M. Shadows, Louis C.K., Roger Federer, Larry King, Philip Zimbardo, Bill Nye,[44] Stan Lee, John Mather, David Copperfield, Michael Moore, Spike Lee, Paul Krugman, Danny Boyle, rapper J. Cole,[45] Al Gore, Roger Ebert, Michael Bolton, Gary Johnson, Lawrence Krauss, Jill Stein, Kevin Rudd, Julie Benz,[46] Amanda Palmer,[47] Tim Ferriss,[48] Gordon Ramsay,[49] Peter Dinklage,[50] Chandra Wickramasinghe,[51] Neil deGrasse Tyson,[52] and Bernie Sanders.[53] Donald Trump (during his 2016 Presidential Campaign) had an AMA on Donald subreddit.[54] As of April 2015, Barack Obama's AMA is the highest rated on the site;[55] the increased traffic brought down many parts of the website when the AMA occurred on August 29, 2012.[56]
Celebrities participating in IAmAs have seen both positive and negative responses. Woody Harrelson's[57] AMA was criticized after Harrelson declined to answer questions that were unrelated to the movie Rampart he was promoting.[58] In contrast, rapper Snoop Dogg attracted 1.6 million page views[59] after conducting an AMA that provided several candid responses to the community's questions.[60]

Its the road to acceptance.  
This is why HODL is a thing.  I, and many like me, consider spending Bitcoin as selling Bitcoin so I (we) evangelize "Save Bitcoin, spend fiat". 
In your example, put yourself in the shoes of a lemonade stand owner that accepted Bitcoin May 2015 and had 32 Bitcoin in his possession.  16 Bitcoin went to bills and he converted 16 Bitcoin into savings in dollars (he completely sold and didnt hold any). $3760 in savings at the price of $235 per Bitcoin.
Its 2017 and you are the business owner. Bitcoin is $1251 per BTC.  What thoughts are going on in your head now?
Its a process.  Its playing out exactly as many Bitcoin evangelists expected.

He spent the last 6 years evangelizing it.  Hes confirmed Bitcoin rich (hes a huge stock holder in a company we all own).  Dont trust the guys who dont own a lot of stock and are trying to pivot the company (they have nothing to lose).
Please dont get buried in the minutia.  If your deep into the tech, go ahead debate the details, but ad hominem (call people names/insult) somewhere else please.
The side bar doesnt say you have to hate this person or that technical decision so lets all calm down and get rich.

yes the blockchain is big and will get bigger as Bitcoin gains popularity.
The blocksize is just the circumference of the pipe.  The quantity of water coming through it will be the same .
4 gallons of water/4 million transactions is 4 gallons of water/4 million transactions.  A bigger pipe/blocksize will push the water through faster/process transactions faster but its still 4 gallons of water/4 million transactions.
@_date: 2017-03-16 10:57:39
the number of transactions on the network is not affected by blocksize, only thoroughput
i dont think storage is even an issue for Core, its bandwidth
thats like saying you wont purchase a faster internet plan because you will download more and fill up your hard disk.
If more people start using Bitcoin because we raise the blocksize, no one that wants Bitcoin to "succeed" would complain.
The worries lie in centralization/2 coin hard forks/stability/loss in trust etc not hard disk space

The creator of Bitcoin created a digital method of preventing "double-spending" of coins and an ingenious way to provide accounting for a digital currency.
Ontop of this great invention, he needed an economic "ideology" to graft on top of this.
He used precious metals and the libertarian ideologies that follow precious metals.
Gold has proven itself to be a very solid base for a currency.  Gold has a theoretical "set limit" and is "mined" at a predictable rate.
Bitcoin, as far as we can see, was modelled around gold.

I've had a really good experience with Coinbase the past couple weeks. I never sold Bitcoin before but I wanted to try since I had 2 btc sitting in breadwallet which was my "pocket change" for the past couple years (no place to spend it).
I buy from Coinbase but I never sold there. Luckily I already went through their anal probe verifying my identity and had their iOS app.
Basically, you just transfer btc to an address they display on the app and it can be automatically sold.  After the transaction is done, you just click withdraw and it appears in your bank account 2 days later.
Anyways, I was so surprised at how ez it was I actually sent 2 more btc there from my stash (i did this while naked in the shower ��)
Anyways, I've seen a lot of anti Coinbase posts lately and I'm not denying they probably have problems; my experience was surprisingly good.

Cash is anonymous, you can walk up to a stranger, you dont know him, and give him the dollar bill.  He can then walk into a store and buy something without the guy at the register wondering where he got the dollar bill.
Cash is non-refundable.  Thats why lots of people (including criminals, but lets not let them spoil the party) love cash.  Thats why merchants love cash.
Cash doesn´t require you signing up for something.  Cash requires no credit checks.  Cash can be used by the poorest of the poor and requires no banking services.

BEIJING—China’s central bank devalued its tightly controlled currency, causing its biggest one-day loss in two decades, as the world’s second-largest economy continues to sputter. 
Chinese authorities said the change would help drive the currency toward more market-driven movements. The move also signaled the government’s growing worry about slow growth. A shift toward a weaker currency could help flagging exports at a time when many other efforts to boost the economy haven’t proven very effective. 
China’s yuan has been on an upward track for a decade, during which the country’s economy grew to be the second largest in the world and the currency gained importance globally. The devaluation Tuesday was the most significant downward adjustment to the yuan since 1994, when as part of a break from Communist state planning, Beijing let the currency fall by one-third. 
China sets a midpoint for the value of the yuan against the U.S. dollar. In daily trading, the yuan is allowed to move 2% above or below that midpoint, which is called the daily fixing. But the central bank sometimes ignores the daily moves, at times setting the fixing so that the yuan is stronger against the dollar a day after the market has indicated it should be weaker.
With Tuesday’s move, the fixing will now be based on how the yuan closes in the previous trading session. As a result, the yuan’s fixing was weakened by 1.9% Tuesday from the previous day, leaving it at 6.2298 to the U.S. dollar, compared with 6.1162 on Monday. The yuan dropped as much as 1.99% from its previous close to 6.3360 against the dollar in Shanghai and fell as much as 2.3% in Hong Kong in early trading. 
The central bank said in a statement posted on its website that the yuan’s midpoint has diverged quite a bit from the market rate for a relatively long time and that it was time to make the midpoint more market-based.
“The PBOC has astutely combined a move to weaken the yuan with a shift to a more market-determined exchange rate,” said  Eswar Prasad, a Cornell University professor and former China head of the International Monetary Fund.
China’s leadership has been urging the IMF to declare the yuan an official reserve currency on par with the dollar, euro, the Japanese yen and the British pound—a move that could raise China’s influence on the world stage just as Beijing increasingly challenges Washington in global affairs.
To that end, the leadership has been resisting an outright devaluation of the currency despite the country’s plunging exports, for fears that a move like that could jeopardize the yuan’s chance of joining the elite group of currencies.
Rather, it chose to do so by giving what the longtime critics of China’s currency policy have long been clamoring for: Let the market play a bigger role in deciding the yuan’s value.
The engineered fall in the yuan is likely to cause political ripples around the world. In particular it may reignite criticism of China’s tight control over the yuan’s exchange rate within the U.S. Congress and some American businesses, which have long said the currency was already too weak and set at a rate that allowed Chinese exporters to sell their goods artificially cheap on world markets. 
As recently as April, other central bankers were speaking confidently that China wouldn’t devalue. This puts pressure on them to follow suit. China’s currency move also could pose a challenge for the U.S. Federal Reserve. The Fed is preparing to raise U.S. interest rates later this year. One source of concern for the Fed this year has been a strong U.S. dollar, which is squeezing exports and helping to hold U.S. inflation below the Fed’s 2% target. China’s move puts more upward pressure on the dollar, which could be exacerbated further when the Fed actually raises rates. 
In a semiannual report about world currency exchange rates published in April, the Treasury Department credited China for allowing the yuan to rise in recent years but also said the currency remained “significantly undervalued” and “that fundamental factors for [yuan] appreciation remain intact, highlighting the need for further strengthening over the medium-term.” 
But in May, the IMF said China’s yuan was no longer undervalued for the first time in more than a decade, a milestone in the country’s efforts to open its economy.
Despite China’s depiction of its move as an effort to let the market determine the yuan’s value, the devaluation is likely to rankle policymakers in Washington given what they saw as commitments from China in recent months to limit intervention.
After high-level talks with Chinese officials in June, U.S. Treasury Secretary  Jacob Lew said China agreed to intervene in foreign-exchange markets “only when it’s necessitated by disorderly market conditions and will consider additional measures to transition to a market-oriented exchange rate.” 
Still, U.S. officials, who had objected to the IMF’s latest assessment of the yuan, considered that a narrow victory given China’s considerable latitude in determining what constituted “disorderly conditions.”
“The real test is going to be, when there’s upward pressure on the [yuan], will China refrain from intervening?” Mr. Lew said at the time. “And that is still an open issue.”
The news comes weeks before China’s President  Xi Jinping is due to visit Washington for a summit with U.S. President  Barack Obama, who has resisted calls to describe Beijing as a currency manipulator during his time in office but is now likely to face new pressure on the currency question.
China’s decision to allow the yuan to depreciate is likely to create an outcry in Congress as the presidential-election season heats up, said Conference Board economist  Andrew Polk. While China has taken the step for domestic reasons, that is unlikely to stop a divided Congress from reacting, he said. “It’s going to be a headache.  Donald Trump is going to have a field day with this,” he added, referring to the real-estate developer and Republican presidential candidate. 
The devaluation on Tuesday comes just over 10 years after China began a process that sharply lifted the value of its currency, and which together with other efforts to restructure its exchange rate helped make the yuan one of the most actively used currencies in Asia. 
On July 21, 2005, China surprised global financial markets by saying it would remove a hard peg that for over a decade had valued the U.S. dollar at 8.28 yuan. The People’s Bank of China’s initial 2.1% move in 2005 pushed the dollar down to 8.11 yuan, and the yuan kept rising in subsequent years. By yesterday’s market close in Shanghai trading, the U.S. dollar bought 6.2097 yuan, meaning the Chinese currency had risen about 33% against the dollar during the decade. 
Tuesday’s move could give a shot in the arm to China’s weakened exports sector, which remains an important part of the economy despite Beijing’s effort to seek growth beyond its traditional sources. On Saturday, Chinese officials said July exports fell a surprising 8.3% from a year earlier. Exports for the first seven months of the year were down 0.8% in dollar terms compared with a year earlier.
The strong exchange rate against the euro has been a drag on China’s exports. The PBOC has kept the yuan steady against the dollar but doesn’t as regularly influence its exchange rate against other currencies, allowing the yuan to follow the dollar’s rise against other currencies like the euro. The latest data showed exports to the European Union fell 12% in July from a year ago. 
China’s economic growth in the second quarter came in at 7% year over year, the slowest pace in six years, due to a weak property market and soft domestic demand in addition to exports. China’s cabinet, the State Council, said last month it would offer tax breaks and other incentives to help the trade sector. Other measures Beijing has taken include four rate interest-rate cuts since November to provide funds for domestic companies. 
The currency action raises questions about whether China will be able to pull off its shift to an economy oriented toward domestic demand and away from export-led growth. 
“The real proof in whether this change is about reform or growth will come when authorities resist the urge to intervene down the road when another policy goal that could be achieved by a significant revaluation or devaluation comes knocking,” said  Scott Kennedy, an analyst at the Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies, a Washington think tank. 
“China wasn’t able to resist that urge on the stock market, so the government doesn’t get the benefit of the doubt on this quite yet,” Mr. Kennedy said, a reference to China’s recent moves to prevent further declines in its equities markets.
China shares wavered between positive and negative territory after the announcement, a day after Shanghai posted its largest daily percentage gain in a month. The Shanghai Composite Index was last flat at 3929.26 while the smaller Shenzhen market was up 0.7% at 2290.

We all understand your frustration.
That "friction" you are feeling is coming from government regulation, anti-money laundering and know your customer requirements.
Coinbase/Circle etc have to comply with these laws or the government is going to shut them down.
Contact support at Circle/Coinbase and ask them to virtually "accompany" you as you go through the verification process.  They will ask you questions/indicate what might be wrong right then and there so you do not have to wait for answers.
I only successfully confirmed with Coinbase after doing what I just suggested.  I failed the verification like 5 times until I contacted support via chat and told them to stay with me and tell me what is wrong as I went through the process.
Once you actually have Bitcoin, and start using it, the experience will most likely be the exact opposite of what you just had.  No identity needed, no signups needed, send your Bitcoin wherever to whomever you want without needing permission.
Good luck!

Would you say Microsoft Word has value to a writer?  The internet to a human?  Facebook to an expat?  Would you describe that value as electrons?  So is value tangible?  Gold has electrons too, 79 to be exact.
Intrinsic value is a subjective metric of value.  How valuable is gold to a monkey?  Sea shells to JP Morgan´s IT department?  Zimbabwe dollars to an italian?
Bitcoin is a scarce digital resource that has all the properties of gold except it can be teleported around the world instantly at near zero cost.

I put it to you that Bitcoin is a commodity currency very similar to a gold coin.  The value and wealth is held by the possessor and its intrinsic value is it can teleport to any other person on earth, cannot be counterfeit and its scarcity is guaranteed.
Gold´s intrinsic value is not jewelry or electronics if you are coming here from the Peter Schiff school.  It is it´s money properties that give it its value (scarcity being important)
Bitcoin is not fiat currency.  It is the soundest, hardest money in existence today (precious metals are no longer hard after the first asteroid is mined)

When the fork happens, keep sending your full balance of Bitcoin XT coins to new wallet addresses you create until the transaction gets into a &gt;1mb mined block.
When this happens, you have now re-created your balance of both core and xt coins (if you had 25 BTC-XT, you now have 25 BTC XT and 25 BTC-Core)!
Whatever market there is for core coins (if it hasn't died) you can now sell or buy stuff :P

Of course I have which is why I asked the question.
You imply the natural outcome of a 75%(XT)/25%(Core) mining split would be the 75% mining pools to "trash" the 25% pools.  But I countered with the plausible scenario where the 75% pool would not see the 25% pool as an enemy, but as a proverbial "life raft" just in case the XT version failed.  I say it is science (they see each other as survival paths) and not religion (we believe this, you believe that and we hate/attack each other)
I should have been more clear.  Which goes back to my original point, 25% doesnt really mean defeat if the actors behave logically (survival)

There is no other coin like Bitcoin, but it doesn't take an incredibly vivid imagination to imagine what "splitting the bitcoin community in two" and how that would affect the price of Bitcoin.
The longer this core coin (non 8mb limit coin) lives, the closer we get to destroying faith in this "thing" we have.

Hi!  First off, I appreciate you taking the time to respond. 
I have a question (maybe off topic but on topic as it pertains to you )  Now that I have you here :)
1)  I currently use an old Multibit 0.5.18.  I dont plan on upgrading since your wallet has worked fine for the past couple years.  Is there any reason to upgrade?  Will there be a time when it will suddenly stop working?
2)  I notice that multibit says it is "syncing with network" and appears to pull down some blocks.  Is the entire blockchain stored down here on my side?  I would like this to be the case.  I do not want any company knowing what addresses are in my possession and I do not want any polling up to a server giving away what addresses I own.  
This is another reason why I do not want to upgrade.  Most wallets now are "lite clients" that basically send out this unique number and associate it with my identity/IP.
Thanks in advance!

@_date: 2015-07-30 08:29:12
I agree with Greg that we shouldn't stop trying to come to an agreement about what should be done.  
Bitcoiner's, please don't be "religious" in your belief in 8mb/1mb. What we want, as investors/believers, is for the programmers/architects to walk out of the meeting room shaking hands.
The outcome for Bitcoin is unclear in either scenario (8mb/1mb) so we should not back either one like it's a jihad.
If the programmers cannot come to consensus, I attribute it to pumped up egos and immaturity.
@_date: 2015-07-31 19:08:59
It will never happen.  Anyone that has even dust amounts of BTC would never allow it.
And luckily it is we who decide.

@_date: 2015-08-03 21:57:34
Whats funny is this already happened.  Its called Dogecoin.  They are worth like 174 satoshis each.
Increasing the limit on Bitcoin would just be a new coin, there is no reason for discussion on this point.  The amount of people that would not switch would be &gt; 60% without question.  That means the increased limit coin would start off at a price around 2 satoshis.
How many miners wanna switch to that?
This isnt even a thought experiment because it happened already in Freiecoin, Dogecoin etc etc etc.  Its just a new crap coin.

@_date: 2015-07-23 06:25:16
Do you think we would ever reach 100% consensus?  We have to hard fork at some point, I'm sure you could agree with that.  
If your contention is you will only support hard forks with 100% consensus then we are either never gonna hard fork or 100% to you means hard forking with changes you personally agree with (sorry if this sounds _ad hominem_, I am just clarifying my feelings on the matter)
This is not to say I am in the 8mb camp anymore.  To be honest, at the beginning of this post I was, and now I pretty much am scared shitless of a split.  
But if I do support keeping things the way they are, its not because I do not agree with Gavin's technical reasons, its because I am nervous about destroying this thing I have invested so much time and mental energy + money into from a contentious hard fork.
edit:  and in regards to your points, the importance of running full nodes is very important.  Incentivizing the running of full nodes is an important feature that needs to be dealt with (I really think it is a problem that should be solved not by lowering bandwidth requirements but by having actual incentives).

One thing regarding Coinbase/Circle
Yes, just assume that these companies are disclosing everything
But seriously, an escort isn't suddenly going to become a cypherpunk and learn how to get BTC back into cash without an on/off ramp like circle/coinbase.
I dont think anything can happen if random customers send her BTC.  She can just say she does digital drawings and gets paid in btc or whatever.
They will have a bad time if they have to figure out how to turn BTC into $$ any other way.
They should go through the Circle/Coinbase anal probe and get identified (that should be fine)
Then when they receive BTC they can just sell it no hassle.
I dont know what this would mean tax wise, but credit cards are the same thing.
TLDR:  making a hooker learn how to transform BTC-&gt;$$ is way too hard (heres btc, now when your done selling your body, go outside and sell this=terrible experience).  Coinbase is fine and will probably be x100 times better experience for them.

Thanks for stopping by Erik.  The 8mb increase requires the binaries being hosted on another website, that is the one thing that really threw up a red flag in my mind.  
So many will be running core + later versions.  The potential for creating 2 different coins is there.
Isn't there any way we can get Mike and Gavin and Blockstream together for some kind of tribunal to settle this?  Keep Bitcoin.org hosting binaries of Bitcoin and not create these copies?

Very good explanation.  Thanks for this.
Addendum:  Lets say I am a holder of 25,000 BTC and the split occurs and I control say a non trivial amount of hashing power.  
I now have 25,000 core btc and 25,000 xt btc.
The market price for core coin is 25% of XT coin.
Wouldnt game theory say I would naturally point my hashing power to the core blockchain now to prop up that price to double my stash?

Why do people create sockpuppets when discussing block size?
I'm not qualified to offer an alternative but I do own Bitcoin so I want it to succeed.
From all I have read here and on BitcoinTalk.org I do not see Gavin's proposal as being too risky compared to some of the other proposals (8mb limit with steady increases)
His proposal seems very reasonable.
I think other proposals are more sketchy.  Calculating blocksize "on the fly" based on history sounds elegant but, in my mind, will be "gamed" which will most likely result in developers running around with their hair on fire trying to fix a "game breaking" bug to salvage the system.
I'm all in for 8mb until convinced otherwise.

You say


I say


To put it in plain english since i sense your snarkiness.
Your company of 20 people own many mining rigs (75% for arguments sake) and have 3000 bitcoins.  Hard fork comes.  You now have 3000 Core btc and 3000 xt btc.
In your mind, you see absolutely no reason why your company, who is now mining the XT chain,  shouldnt "trash" the core pool and ensure it disintegrates?
I just questioned this


thats all
TLDR: I think mining pools will not spread aids to opposing mining pools unless the certainty of death is imminent for one of the coins.  If both are "rumbling" along nicely without any core code failures, attacks will be few and far between except by those who are extreme gamblers/speculators (which probably wont be enough hashing to "trash" effectively) or by those that went "all in" and dumped their "other pool" holdings (people wont do this unless they know the other coin is certainly dead)

@_date: 2015-07-23 05:08:16


Trying to predict the incentive for a mining pool during this event is a non starter.  We can give probabilities, but a pool may, for ideological reasons or a dozen other reasons, decide to service the old chain.
The confusion of people receiving coin p2p, not necessarily from payment processors, or "home rolled" payment processors (I made one when I wanted to learn about coding in bitcoin) has the potential to cause quite a stir.
My point is, a split during a hard fork is a fact and not fear mongering; it is simply, fact.
Your "appeal to probability", basically giving probable outcomes and assuming it will play out this way is not 100%, not 90%, matter of fact its probably a hell of a lot lower things will play out just so.
If you browse my comment history, the only stand I ever took in this "debate" has been support of Gavin and the increase in block size.  I just wish there was a way the devs could come together and place that feature into core and not create this ridiculously immature hard fork.

His "kludginess" in artistic decisions.  The name Mojo. Think of Satoshi's attempt at a gambling user interface.
Tiny drops and hints in the Q&amp;amp;A where he reveals his experience of "friction" in creating money touching software systems. 
The software system he describes is nearly Bitcoin.
His English. His grammar/style is exactly what I see in his published writings.
His slight adversity to being the focus of attention. Positive reinforcement from the audience doesn't seem to affect his ego. He has no desire to be a star but to share his invention.

75% thanks So, the way you play this thought experiment out is, XT is on the rise and in say 7 months it achieves 75%.  The split occurs.  Market prices start to popup for core &amp; xt coins. (lets say they start off XT 75% market price to cores 25%).  
Mining pools who mine core will begin to capitulate to XT and the flight results in major dumping of core coins until core mining evaporates completely..
Ok. I buy that.
Edit: But what if a pool with a large amount of hashing power has 25,000 btc when the split occurs.  They now have 25000 core btc and 25,000 xt btc.
Wouldnt their incentive be to point their hashing power to the core pool to attempt a "market revival" to increase the price of core btc (for profit?)

But it is altruistic.  So if I was already rich where I didn't need a full time job, I would do it just to help the network and for fun.

The opposite of this is true.  
Bitcoin is fundamentally distinct from every other fiat currency.  
_Fiat money is currency which derives its value from government regulation or law_
Bitcoin is not fiat.  There is no government or law stating this MUST be exchanged for goods and services public or private.
Bitcoin's monetary quantity is set in stone and cannot be changed without consensus (better chance an asteroid hitting us and destroying all life on earth) therefor it can be considered a collectible digital token (digital gold).
Bitcoin can be considered a store of value.  If you read this article  (author: The Heretic's Guide to Global Finance: Hacking the Future of Money) he states that






From this definition of money, one can plug in Bitcoin's feature list and come to the conclusion that Bitcoin is a claim on value and not a store of value.  I disagree based on how bitcoin actually works.  A burned bitcoin private key renders the bitcoin value it references virtually destroyed.  If you don't understand why that is watch this video:  
In his analogy of a claim on a coke bottle and the actual coke, imagine if there was an invisible hand that automatically destroyed the actual coke bottle when a claim paper is burned.  That is Bitcoin.
edit:  I didnt explain why that is important.  It is because a good way to preserve wealth is to actually hold the collectibles in your hands and not depend on someone else holding it for you (think Great Depression, Cyprus, Greece, Venezuala, USA (2% inflation every year is healthy! (until you see the 5 year charts))).
Bitcoin is like an expensive painting, gold, an antique watch.  The value of these items go up in time.  They are rare and collectible. Owning a bitcoin is like owning a bar of actual gold, not a piece of paper that promises you your gold is somewhere. (The ironic part is, a private key is an actual claim on the value of a set number of inputs on the blockchain, so in technology terms, it is a claim on value; in monetary terms, it is a store of value)
Bitcoin can be sent to anyone, anywhere, instantly.
Bitcoin cannot be counterfeit.
So, in closing.


The opposite of this is true.  
*Bitcoin is fundamentally distinct from every other fiat currency.*  
This is not opinion, this is a side-by-side comparison between 2 product's feature list (in this case the product is money).

The whole idea that large financial entities will not "prop up" Bitcoin due to it being a potential "long term threat", or because of "feelings" of jealousy at early adopters capturing a windfall is ridiculous.
Ironically, it will be the small-medium size banks that will increase the market price of Bitcoin (artificially) to allow it to be used as a clearing house for inter-bank commerce. The profit captured in the short term will be the incentive.  The higher the market price of Bitcoin, the more useful it will become as a payment rail.
@_date: 2015-07-22 13:13:27
I don't completely agree with you but understand its like 60/40 not 100/0 in my mind.
I just think Bitcoin has made it this far without politics or gimmicks;  without marketing meetings where suits drill down the latest polls and how that might affect our product brand.
We got this far solely on merit; on Bitcoin's usefulness. Sharing is caring in this case and I think if we could help in real, practical life scenarios then we should do it.

I used Greece as an example just because many economists are hypothesizing what would happen if they created a gold backed currency as a result of their current situation.
I am not discussing Greeks problems or offering solutions.  
I just wanted to "paint a picture" of the expected behavior of world actors if 1 country (any country) changed to a gold backed currency while the rest stayed fiat.
Any country that held a trade surplus with the country issuing a gold backed currency would not actually keep the surplus in that nations currency, but would instead trade it in for that country's gold.  Resulting in a huge outflow of that country's reserves.
In other words, the same way a gold backed currency would be "coveted" is the same way Bitcoin will be viewed when placed alongside any fiat currency.

There are hundreds of possibilities.  This being one of them.
Satoshi himself stated that Bitcoin was gonna be extremely valuable or worth nothing in the future.
It's not a stretch to understand why that would be.
Think of why the United States de-tethered the US dollar from gold.  Whenever you have a limited, coveted resource (in this case gold); creditors will suck every ounce of it from you if they have the opportunity.
edit:  we unpegged the dollar from gold because countries that had huge supplies of dollars (in europe) wanted gold instead.  The US panicked since this would destroy the gold reserves, so they de-pegged in August 1971. 
Imagine if Greece suddenly stated that their currency was gold based.  A single currency in the world is gold based while 200 countries print paper.
You would see extreme outflows of gold from Greece.  Think of hyenas surrounding a big, fat, juicy lamb.
This is Bitcoin in a world of paper.  It is even more rare than gold and swimming in a world of currencies that are artificial and plentiful.
Once Bitcoin gets its "sea legs" under it, and is "alive" past puberty, it will be coveted like a gold based currency would be coveted in a world of worthless monetary product.
I can see it be that tether behind the paper that countries transact with.  The main rail. The world reserve.
So yes, definitely not unbelievable.

So before you answer this with "just print gazillions of btc!" Remember the price goes down every single time you mint a coin.

BitMain left code in their miners to allow their servers to remotely shut off your miner.  They say they did this because they have documented customers who have had their miners stolen/confiscated and this allows the customer to shut off the equipment that was stolen.

Bitcoin is a new technology and we are "fans" of this new technology.
Bitcoin is different than other technologies because it is a currency. Currency is used by everyone for every transaction.
So you might think "fans" of a specific web browser or a video game may be "cultish", but not everyone surfs the web or plays video games; but everyone uses money.
Simply put, imagine if you knew for a fact every single person you knew played massively multiplayer first person shooter video games (every single person in the world). You are playing a new game that has features that are categorically "better" than the old massively multiplayer first person shooter that every single person in the world was playing. The type of enthusiasm you could imagine yourself having when describing this new game to others in everyday life is what many of us in the community often do (often mistakenly since everyone may use money, but many are not interested in a new money)
Since the use of money is universal, Bitcoin has an extremely strong "network effect" where users of it are strongly incentivized to get others to use it in the same way that the original users of the telephone or facebook really really wanted you to buy a telephone or register on Facebook.
You doing this increases the usefulness of Bitcoin, not by +1 but by ^x (exponentially)
So yes, the casual observer looks upon the community as being "cultish", but it is all perfectly logical given that the technology we are supporting happens to be money.

The easy way out would be throw the voter mandate in the voter's faces, dump the euro, fire up the drachma printing press and go full retard on the corruption.

So your saying that, as a solution, PoS allowing for control of both the currency and the currency minting/transaction approval is more elegant than separating the concerns?
You find no violations to the Single Responsibility Principle here?
I am not working on blockchain technologies but have been programming for about 20 years now and PoS seems wrong.  The idea of separating the minting/transaction approval and the currency seems more elegant along with the idea of requiring a "proof of work" and "permission-less participation"
edit:  and to be clear, i just robbed an exchange for say 100,000 BTC.  I have now essentially not only robbed the exchange, but am using this theft to mint a fair number of coins and am eligible to sit in a big chair at the roundtable of miners as an elevated member.

Start the workshop with a 12 word mnemonic phrase (BIP39)
Take that phrase and show how to generate a private key - all the way to public address.
The GUI would be, enter mnemonic phrase click button, then display the private key, public key and public address.
Then build a way to parse the blockchain to monitor a single address.
Create an "event driven" service that monitors addresses.
Create a client to the service that automatically sends any money that comes into the address to another address.
At the end of the class, send money from your phone to the address and watch as all the money your students sent to the addresses they are monitoring come piling into a single address.
Run away with the money screaming "IT WASNT ME.  IT WASNT ME."

This is true.
Bitcoin is a scarce collectible, more rare than gold.
If you had a gold coin in one hand and a $100 bill in the other.  You walk into Walmart and they are selling a tv that costs $100 or 1 gold coin, they accept both in this example.  Which would you use?
Now say you have $10,000 and a bar of gold ($10,000 worth) and you could pass only one of these to your children, which would you give them? Which would have more buying power in say 10 or 20 years?
Bitcoin is more scarce than gold with all of the properties of gold save its glitz.  
So yes, I hold Bitcoin and spend paper.

Is there a name for the flavor of PoS you are describing?  
Edit:  And what about concentrations of power?  At least with PoW the currency is separated from the mining.  With PoS, if you are in the 1%, you now have both the power of being the largest miner + holding the most currency.  Sounds dystopian.
Edit2:  And I am not convinced the example of a thief purchasing cloud miners correctly paints the picture of the situation.  After stealing 100,000 btc from an exchange, handing it over to a cloud miner in any large quantity seems unbelievable at its most basic level (the risk of losing it to a third party would be too much to bear)
I am almost convinced, but I cant help imagining the PoS thought experiment you are expressing is exactly the thought experiment a 1%'er (someone who owns a large portion of a specific coin) would try and evangelize (I know this sounds like I am insinuating something, I am not, it is just how I feel about it)

Bob's left hand started to shiver.  He felt that weight, pressing first inside his head, then slowing moving, like a puppeteer, to his chest;  it needed to come out.
"Bob SAGAT! FAGGOT!"
"BOB SAGAT! FAGGOT!"
"Bob SAGAT FAGGOT!"
Alice, unbelievably, was now holding my right hand.
"Can she read my mind?" he thought to himself.
The bald guy in the corner looked across from his lady companion with a startled look of surprise and met my eyes with confusion. The girl turned, hand helping her twist her largess body to do the same.
The rest of the cafe was a blur as the tic started to subside. 
The waiter approached.
"Sir.  If you cannot quiet.." the waiter was red faced and looked to have a half finished cup of coffee in his left hand, with stains of hurried drinking.
Alice hurridely interjected "We are extremely sorry for the disturbance.  My friend has tourette syndrome"
The waiter's face went from anger to understanding quicker than any could have hoped.  He thought more carefully before responding.
"I am sorry sir.  I understand. We have tables outside if.."
Bob cut him off before he could finish.
"Just the check please."
The look of relief on the waiter's face couldn't be more apparent.
"Alice, I'm sorry.. I."
For some strange reason, Alice looked.. Annoyed? At me?
"Don't you dare apologize for something you have no control over" she said and grabbed his right hand with a ferocity that made him wince at first.
The check was placed on the table by a waiter who seemed to ignore the other patrons.  He waited, almost impatiently by the table.
"I got this" he said to Alice, pulling a 10 dollar bill from his wallet.
He gave it to the waiter, the waiter handed him back his change.
"You wanted to know what Bitcoin was Alice?  Bitcoin was that.  Just over the internet."
Alice looked back at him after finishing her coffee.  "You mean like when I use PayPal? Or my credit card?"
"No.  I just used cash.  He doesnt know me, I dont know him. Its that, just over the internet"
"That makes sense.  But Bob, why did you give me a 45 minute speach with spreadsheets and soduko puzzles?"
Bob stood up grabbed his coat

Each person's list is their own, mine looks something like 
Bitcoin has all the properties of gold minus its physical limitations with the added benefit that it cannot be counterfeit or seized.
Bitcoin is not controlled by the state, a state that I have lost confidence in.
Bitcoin can be sent to anyone, anywhere, anytime.
Bitcoin is programmable.
Bitcoins are limited.  It is a scarce resource which I believe money should be (a collectible).
Use of Bitcoin's payment network is nearly free.
Bitcoin is fairly anonymous.  Anonymous in the sense that no one would ever be able to trace me unless I "lead" them to my door (in a bitcoin-&gt;fiat world that is very possible, but if you could envision a bitcoin economy, bitcoin forensics become a tad harder).
So on the basis of a feature by feature comparison with todays currencies, Bitcoin wins.  You would need to combine things like credit cards with a currency then add paypal to the mix along with networks like SWIFT/other clearing houses in order to gather enough features to be able to compare todays currencies with Bitcoin.

I have imported all the keys that coinwallet.eu gave away approximately 9 hours ago (usable money all since swept).
The balance of all the keys was approximately (im at work now so don't know what it currently is) 0.156 Bitcoin after the vultures ripped apart the rest.
This balance is un-spendable via conventional means (via a wallet) in any meaningful quantity due to each input being 0.0001.  The number of inputs are too much for Bitcoin Core to handle (I haven't tried other wallets)
I tried programmatically spending the inputs using zero fees and one got through but I have had trouble using the "sendtoaddress" function in core so just stopped trying. 
I assume you need to create a raw transaction and just loop through each input and send it off to an address you control.
Anyways, was fun.
We have to abstract away the idea of inputs.  If your wallet has .156 bitcoin confirmed, it should be spendable regardless of the amount of inputs.

To start a bank "business", the regulations that need to be met is completely different from one country to the next.
Starting a bank in the Cayman islands is powers of magnitude easier than in the USA.
The cost, regardless of where you setup a bank, is very high.  Many buy banks instead of trying to create one and there are companies that specifically setup/start banks with the sole intent to resell them to people who want to start a bank (many times the cost is equal if not less to actually buy a bank already started)

Als Satoshi Nakamoto Anfang 2009 zum ersten Mal die Bitcoin-Blockchain in Gang setzte stellte er mit dieser Veröffentlichung zwei fundamentale und bislang ungetestete Konzepte vor. Das erste Konzept ist „Bitcoin“, eine dezentrale Peer-to-Peer Onlinewährung, die ihren Wert behält, obwohl sie durch nichts hinterlegt ist, keinen intrinsischen Wert besitzt und von keiner zentralen Instanz herausgegeben wird. Bis jetzt hat Bitcoin als Währung den Großteil der öffentlichen Aufmerksamkeit auf sich gezogen. Vor allem die politischen Aspekte einer Währung ohne herausgebende Zentralbank als auch die extreme Volatilität der Bitcoins sorgten für medialen Aufruhr. Satoshis großartiges Experiment beinhaltet jedoch ein zweites, ebenso wichtiges Konzept: Die Idee einer auf Proof-of-Work basierenden Blockchain, die es erlaubt, allgemeine Übereinstimmung über die Reihenfolge von Transaktionen zu finden. Anwendungstechnisch kann Bitcoin als First-to-File System beschrieben werden. Wenn beispielsweise Instanz A 50 BTC besitzt und diese gleichzeitig an Instanz B und C versendet wird nur diejenige Transaktion verarbeitet, die zuerst bestätigt wird. Die Problemstellung, dass es keinen inhärenten Weg gibt um festzustellen, welche Transaktion zuerst ausgeführt wurde, behinderte jahrzzehntelang die Entwicklung eines dezentralen digitalen Zahlungsmittels. Satoshis Blockchain ist die erste ernstzunehmende dezentrale Lösung. Nun ist der Zeitpunkt erreicht, an dem sich das öffentliche Interesse immer mehr diesem zweiten Teil der Bitcoin-Technologie zuwendet. Die zentrale Frage lautet, wie das Konzept der Blockchain für Anwendungen abseits einer reinen Währung verwendet werden kann.

Too much of the criticism in my opinion is based on the people (talking about how useless Bitcoin may be in its present state; while "fans" tend to grasp on Bitcoin's potential.
A good analogy would be the cell phone of the 1990s.  Buttcoiners would be denouncing the cell phone because it came in a suitcase, disconnected 90% of the calls midway through, never had any coverage and correctly pointed out that land lines were crisper/clearer and of course more reliable.
"Fans" of cell phone technology would be telling the naysayers "you are missing the point of a mobile phone's potential"

Sidechains peg to Bitcoin at a specific rate.
1 BTC = 100BrainDamageCoin
You created BrainDamageCoin but don't have the mining power to protect it.  So you pegged it to Bitcoin.  Bitcoin's mining power is Ft. Knox type protection for your currency now.
Your currency is getting really popular.  Your iOs game the currency is used in just hit  app store and people are buying your currency en masse for cool haircuts on their avatar, in game liposuction and tattoos!
People are essentially buying Bitcoin on coinbase, then transforming (via the sidechain peg) it to your currency.  Bitcoin's price is getting higher because of this also!  
The Bitcoin used to get BrainDamageCoin is not resold (causing market pressure); it is, essentially, put in frozen stasis.  Your company gets the BrainDamageCoin and goes the other way and gets the Bitcoin back (the btc is released again).
A blockchain solves a problem that companies do not have.  Blockchains solve consensus amongst untrusted peers.  If you are a single company looking to solve an internal problem, you have the power to force consensus (you are the boss).
We can envision conglomerates/groups of companies that do not necessarily trust each other using blockchain tech for consensus, that is innovative.  But who are the miners?  The public?  The "public" has the ability to tear down any SHA-256 coin, disintegrate it.
But never envision CompanyX using blockchain tech internally to distribute a company scrip(money).  They can just use MySQL.

When a customer pays for your service, would you rather accept cash or credit card?
Bitcoin is digital cash.  If I were standing next to you right now I could hand you a $20 bill.  Bitcoin allows us to do just that, only now, over the internet.
Bitcoin is a digital cash transaction.  It is irreversible and arrives to you in seconds.  Bitcoin can't be counterfeit, is more rare than gold and the transaction fees are measured in pennies.
Bitcoin is beneficial for both the merchant and consumer.  The consumer likes Bitcoin because it is both easy to use and cheaper than other payment systems.  Using Bitcoin as a consumer allows us to not have to worry about sending sensitive information over the internet, like credit card numbers.  Bitcoin is like cash in that there is no sensitive information contained in the transaction.
Bitcoin makes your job easier by relieving you of the responsibility of having sensitive customer information on file which may make you liable if it ever was stolen.
I believe Bitcoin is the evolution of money and I sincerely hope you consider accepting it in the future.

That moment when you understand Bitcoin and remittances (me 1 year ago)
_This guy is pretty grounded and well-informed._
_He himself is a bitcoin miner and investor. He is correct, for a business as big as Western Union, they have to observe and see if the regulatory environment settles down to a point where they can themselves invest and profit from the bitcoin network._
_Great article._
_It's interesting though, when the remittance domain is looked upon from a high level, that Bitcoin has an unbelievable advantage and can be considered a heavy-weight boxer in a match against a lightweight contender._
_What I mean is, lets say you are an Indian programmer living in Los Angeles and send money back to your father and mother living in Calcutta. In Calcutta there is one exchange that changes bitcoins to rupees, 1 grocery store that your mother visits and 2 stores online that your father uses that accepts bitcoin._
_You send them bitcoin and they use it obviously to buy food, maybe buy stuff online, and cash out most into rupees using the exchange. You do this every week say._
_But when looked upon as an executive from Western Union, you cannot look upon the use-case I just described and see any practical way to help/intermediate this process and provide value to the remitter. There is no way to "help" that use case and profit from it._
_So ye, its probably obvious to all us bitcoiners, but it must be quite hard to come to terms with this as a remittance business._
_Edit: after pondering my thoughts, reading uDemotruk 's comments and gazing into the air in front of me for about 5 minutes, I think what I just realized is: Bitcoin does not compete with the remittance market, because there is no remittance market. **The act of sending money is not a market in the bitcoin world**. Its intrinsic behaviour to Bitcoin. Neo, do you think thats air your breathing?_
_Bitcoin does not compete with remittance businesses, it makes them irrelevant._

Bitcoin switches to PoS.
I work for a u.s. Agency assigned to disrupt/destroy Bitcoin.
The government accumulates 500,000 bitcoins from all its black market stings.
I just don't own currency now. I control your network.
You try and do blockchain rollbacks like other pos coins and destroy the currency by destroying fungibility.
You blacklist coins destroying fungibility, destroying currency.
Or keep it pow
PoW, I invest a billion dollars to produce Asics covertly (good luck), hire hundreds of people to maintain them then have to make sure they cannot be easily kicked off the network as I spam double spend attacks.
Whoops Bitcoin devs figured out how to isolate who the bad actors are on the network and kicked us out ohh damn a billion dollars down the drain and a factory full of heaters shouldn't have fucked with Bitcoin 
Edit:  and to this


If you are sitting in a meeting with anyone who is not suffering from brain damage, you will not be investing in a product that depends on the stupidity and/or ignorance of your consumer base.  I do not know Marc Andreesen personally, but from what I have watched and heard, he is at least above average in intelligence and wouldnt invest millions into a company who's business model is to "sneak" penny miners into toasters.
Who in their right mind would buy a router that is using your bandwidth to mine a penny a week.
I do not believe 21 inc is doing this at all.  And if they are I will be very disappointed.

We are all taught governments create currency, enforces it as legal tender and creates a monetary policy to govern its growth/constriction
Bitcoin is a currency that has a monetary policy that cannot be changed and is not under the control of governments.
Currency's value can be thought of as a thermometer gauging that currency's health. A high value represents high demand, low value means low demand.
Having monetary levers to artificially reduce or increase demand of a currency (which you imply "guides economies") only obfuscates the true value of said currency and creates boom bust cycles that will rob and destroy wealth.
It is fiscal policies, not monetary policies that "guide economic systems"
Money has one job, to find the right price to allow it to be a good store of value and medium of exchange.
The market's super power is "price finding" the complexities of which would burn out any supercomputer known to man (complexity theory, emergent properties)
So basically, stop associating currency with government.  We used governments to caretake our currencies because we had to. Now we don't. 
Money has one job to do, and Bitcoin was engineered to do that one thing powers of magnitude better than government currency.

Playing with the price means nothing to Bitcoin.  That is all a big investor/Satoshi can do.
Can they defecate on the price costing themselves millions/billions of dollars?  Sure.
If Bitcoin the technology is running as it has the past 5 years, without any ground shaking bugs, nothing will happen to Bitcoin except the distribution goes from a weak/disruptive actor to a new actor.
The price can fluctuate, but the price is set by the market.  Think of the market like you would think of gravity.  The strength of this gravity is proportional to the liquidity of the ecosystem.  So the market will always, every second of every day apply pressure to the price to find it's equilibrium (supply/demand equilibrium).  
Any single actor with enough bitcoin can hold up a very heavy stone (manipulate the price this way or that) but this 'gravity' will constantly apply pressure to find its equilibrium.
Gravity doesnt care about anyone's devious plans.  It knows, eventually, the stone will drop.

Wages are renegotiated and prices of goods and services move with the price forecast made by a specific entrepeneur.
The period of the greatest growth in the U.S. during the nineteenth century, from 1820 to 1850 and from 1865 to 1900, was associated with significant deflation. In those two cases, prices were cut in half.
Deflation caused by growth and not by a failed monetary policy are periods of unprecedented growth and innovation.

They want 2% inflation
_An increase in money supply results in a decrease in the value of money because an increase in money supply causes a rise in inflation. As inflation rises, the purchasing power, or the value of money, decreases. It therefore will cost more to buy the same quantity of goods or services._

Aaron Van Wirdum describes what mimblewhatever is since i had no idea
All (full) Bitcoin nodes verify all transactions on the network. This allows the system to be entirely trustless and decentralized, but also presents significant drawbacks. Privacy and fungibility are at odds, because public transactions allow anyone to trace the flow of bitcoins over the blockchain. Meanwhile, verifying a growing number of transactions adds to the cost of running a node, which could be a centralizing force.
But perhaps these drawbacks can be tackled. Last week, a new white paper was somewhat mysteriously dropped on a Bitcoin research channel, written by the pseudonymous author “Tom Elvis Jedusor” (Voldemort’s real name in the French edition of the Harry Potter novels). His proposal “Mimblewimble” — a reference to a Harry Potter spell — presents a radical slimming-down of the Bitcoin protocol that could not only dramatically increase privacy and fungibility, but also present significantly more scalability than Bitcoin’s current blockchain architecture.
Mimblewimble may just hit two giant birds with one stone. Here’s how.
Hiding Amounts
Mimblewimble is based on some of Bitcoin’s familiar privacy features. One of these is Confidential Transactions, which was mostly developed by Bitcoin Core and Blockstream developer Gregory Maxwell and is currently deployed on Blockstream’s Elements Alpha sidechain.
Confidential Transactions lets senders encrypt the bitcoin amounts in transactions with random strings of numbers called “blinding factors.” This process works because transactions also include information with which (only) receivers can decrypt the amounts. And, by utilizing a cryptographic trick called the Pedersen Commitment, anyone else can still perform math on the encrypted amounts. Specifically, Bitcoin nodes can subtract the encrypted amounts on the sending side of transactions (“inputs”) from the encrypted amounts on the receiving side of transactions (“outputs”). If the two sides cancel out to zero, it means the combined inputs and the combined outputs are equal, and no bitcoins were created out of thin air.
Mimblewimble sort of turns this trick on its head as the receiver of a transaction generates the blinding factor. This is important because as one of the main deviations from the current Bitcoin protocol, this blinding factor is effectively used to prove ownership of the (blinded) bitcoins — private keys are no longer in play at all. (Nor are public keys or addresses.)
Proving ownership of the blinding factor itself revolves around a series of cryptographic tricks that are Mimblewimble’s closest equivalent to Bitcoin’s cryptographic signatures, though the full extent of these tricks is beyond the scope of this article.
It is important to note, however, that part of these mathematical maneuvers includes the introduction of a sort of “dummy output.” Where transaction outputs normally indicate under what conditions the receiver of a transaction may later spend the bitcoins, these dummy outputs are really just random numbers to ensure that only the person who generated the blinding factor can spend the bitcoins in the real outputs.
Combining Transactions
Another familiar Bitcoin trick that inspired Mimblewimble is CoinJoin, first proposed by (again) Maxwell.
CoinJoin allows users to bundle their transactions into one bigger transaction, scrambling all inputs (the “from” part of a transaction), as well as all outputs (the “to” part). This potentially obfuscates which bitcoins were sent from which address to which address, and breaks the assumption that all inputs belong to the same user.
Mimblewimble (and a fix by Blockstream mathematician Andrew Poelstra) takes this concept a bit further and completely gets rid of transactions once a new block is created. Instead of transactions, Mimblewimble blocks mainly consist of three lists: a list of new inputs (referring to old outputs), a list of new outputs and a list of cryptographic signatures created with the aforementioned dummy outputs.
Utilizing the Pedersen Commitment scheme, all nodes can use the input list and the output list, and verify that no bitcoins were created out of thin air. The dummy output signatures, meanwhile, prove that all individual transactions must have been valid. Acting rather like “stamps of approval,” these dummy output signatures only add up mathematically if the whole transaction itself does.
And since it is never revealed which inputs spent bitcoins to which outputs exactly, nor how many bitcoins were actually spent, no trace of funds can be established at all. As such, Mimblewimble presents a tremendous boon for privacy and fungibility.
And then there’s the scalability improvement.
Currently, many transactions on the Bitcoin network are linked. Spending a bitcoin really takes an output from a previous transaction and turns it into an input of a new transaction. This means that if an older transaction is invalid, a newer transaction that relies on the older transaction is invalid, too. So to be able to validate all transactions on the Bitcoin network, nodes must know all transactions that ever took place; the entire blockchain. (That’s currently some 80 gigabytes worth.)
But with Mimblewimble there is no longer really such a thing as a transaction history per coin. Each coin does have a specific block in which it was first created. But from then on, its value simply becomes part of the combined Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) set, which defines all outputs that store coins and could potentially be spent at any time.
This means that in order to verify new transactions, nodes no longer need to care about previous transactions. All they need to care about is that the specific outputs used are valid.
With even more clever math, nodes can establish the validity of outputs relatively easily. They just need the block headers of all blocks (a sort of index of blocks without all transaction data) and the aforementioned dummy output signatures: both relatively compact data-sets. All other transaction data — almost the entire blockchain — can be safely discarded.
The benefit compared to other anonymizing techniques is substantial. If Confidential Transactions and CoinJoin had been used in Bitcoin from day one, nodes would currently require more than a terabyte of data to operate. With Mimblewimble, they would need closer to 120 gigabytes. And perhaps even more interesting: where the blockchain necessarily has to grow over time, the required Mimblewimble dataset does not, and can actually shrink if more bitcoins are stored in fewer outputs.
Now for the bad news. Mimblewimble, in its current form, is not very compatible with the Bitcoin protocol. This is mainly because for Mimblewimble to work, script must be purged from transactions. As such, there would no longer be room for a whole set of Bitcoin features, like time-locked transactions (used for the Lightning Network among other things), atomic swaps (for cross-blockchain interoperability), and more.
But that doesn’t make Mimblewimble useless. Mimblewimble may, for instance, be the perfect fit for a privacy-focused sidechain. Bitcoin users could lock their bitcoins into a specific output on the Bitcoin blockchain and “move” their coins to the Mimblewimble chain. On this sidechain, users could transact freely and privately for as long as they want, until the new owner decides to “move” the funds back to the Bitcoin blockchain by unlocking the original output.
Due to the efficiency offered by Mimblewimble’s sidechain, the added burden of maintaining it would be very manageable. Moreover, it could potentially unload much data from the Bitcoin blockchain, increasing scalability even for those who don’t use Mimblewimble at all. Where sidechains are typically not considered a scaling solution, Mimblewimble offers one.

Central banks around the world are selling U.S. government bonds at the fastest pace on record, the most dramatic shift in the $12.8 trillion Treasury market since the financial crisis.
Sales by China, Russia, Brazil and Taiwan are the latest sign of an emerging-markets slowdown that is threatening to spill over into the U.S. economy. Previously, all four were large purchasers of U.S. debt.
While central banks have been selling, a large swath of other buyers has stepped in, including U.S. and foreign firms. That buying, driven in large part by worries about the world’s economic outlook, has helped keep bond yields at low levels from a historical standpoint.
But many investors say the reversal in central-bank Treasury purchases stands to increase price swings in the long run. It could also pave the way for higher yields when the global economy is on firmer footing, they say.
Central-bank purchases over the past decade are widely perceived to have “helped depress the long-term Treasury bond yields,” said Stephen Jen, managing partner at SLJ Macro Partners LLP and a former economist at the International Monetary Fund. “Now, we have sort of a reverse situation.”
Foreign official net sales of U.S. Treasury debt maturing in at least a year hit $123 billion in the 12 months ended in July, said Torsten Slok, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank Securities, citing Treasury Department data. It was the biggest decline since data started to be collected in 1978. A year earlier, foreign central banks purchased $27 billion of U.S. notes and bonds.
In the past decade, large trade surpluses or commodity revenues permitted many emerging-market countries to accumulate large foreign-exchange reserves. Many purchased U.S. debt because the Treasury market is the most liquid and the U.S. dollar is the world’s reserve currency.
Foreign official purchases rose as high as a net $230 billion in the year ended in January 2013, the Deutsche Bank data show.
But as global economic growth weakened, commodity prices slumped and the dollar rose in anticipation of expected Federal Reserve interest-rate increases, capital flowed out of emerging economies, forcing some central banks to raise cash to buy their local currencies.
In recent months, China’s central bank in particular has stepped up its selling of Treasurys.
The People’s Bank of China surprised investors by devaluing the yuan on Aug. 11. The heavy selloff that followed—triggered by concerns that Beijing would permit more weakening of the yuan to help spur growth—caught officials at the central bank somewhat off guard, according to people close to the central bank.
To contain the selloff, the PBOC has been buying yuan and selling dollars to prevent the yuan from weakening beyond around 6.40 per dollar, according to the people.
Data published Wednesday showed China’s foreign-exchange reserves dwindled further in September, a trend that likely will force the country’s central bank to step up monetary easing. The PBOC said currency reserves fell $43.3 billion last month to $3.51 trillion as more funds left the country, the fifth consecutive monthly drop but a less-sharp one than the record $93.9 billion plunge the previous month.
Internal estimates at the PBOC show that it spent between $120 billion and $130 billion in August alone in bolstering the yuan’s value, according to people close to the central bank.
China, the biggest foreign owner of Treasury securities, owned $1.241 trillion Treasury debt at the end of July, down from a record of $1.317 trillion in November 2013, according to the latest data available from the Treasury.
China isn’t alone. Russia’s holdings of all U.S. Treasury debt fell by $32.8 billion in the year ended in July, according to the latest data available from the U.S. Treasury. Taiwan’s holdings dropped by $6.8 billion. Norway, a developed nation hit by the oil-price decline, reduced its Treasury holdings by $18.3 billion.
Some other central banks increased holdings. India increased its Treasury debt holdings to $116.3 billion at the end of July 2015 from $79.7 billion a year ago. The Federal Reserve held $2.45 trillion of Treasury debt at the end of September and isn’t expected to sell U.S. debt soon.
Traders said China’s selling has been a factor in why 10-year Treasury yields have remained near 2% as stock and commodity markets tumbled in recent months. The yield fell as low as 1.6% before the so-called taper tantrum in mid-2013 as the Fed prepared to end monthly bond purchases.
The 10-year yield settled at 2.061% Wednesday, compared with 2.173% at the end of 2014 and 3.03% at the end of 2013. Yields fall as prices rise.
Some analysts have warned for years that persistent fiscal deficits made the U.S. Treasury market vulnerable to a reduction in foreign purchases. But many investors say they believe longtime holders such as China won’t sell bonds in a way that threatens to disrupt the market.
“I can’t rule out China being a big risk to the bond market but it’s not something that is keeping me awake at night,’’ said James Sarni, senior managing partner at Payden &amp; Rygel in Los Angeles, which manages $95 billion. “While they may decide to sell more Treasury bonds, the transactions are likely to be done in a prudent way.”
Indeed, bond yields have remained persistently low for the past decade and have fallen sharply since the 2008 crisis, thanks in part to strong official and private demand for debt deemed safe.
In the 12 months to July, foreign private investors bought long-term Treasury debt at the fastest pace in more than three years.
U.S. bond mutual funds and exchange-traded funds targeting U.S. government debt have attracted $20.4 billion net cash this year through the end of September, poised for the biggest calendar-year inflow since 2009, according to fund tracker Lipper.
A $21 billion auction of 10-year U.S. government notes on Wednesday attracted the second-highest overseas demand on record.
Sales by foreign central banks could accompany a further decline in bond yields, by underscoring the depth of economic problems hitting emerging regions. For over a decade before the recent slowdown, developing nations, led by China, were viewed as the engine for global economic growth.
“We have a problem of insufficient [economic] demand globally,’’ said Michael Pettis, professor of finance at Guanghua School of Management at Peking University in Beijing.
Slack in the U.S. economy argues against a sharp rise in rates, said Mr. Pettis.
“U.S. bond yields are not going to rise significantly unless we have much stronger growth and higher inflation,” he said.

**Bitcoin’s Allure**
_Furthermore, potential attackers are at a disadvantage for another reason. Bitcoin tends to oppose organizations rather than people. Even someone who stands to lose from Bitcoin by not reacting to it, such as a banker or government agent, stands to gain a great deal by buying now. Only the very wealthiest people might reasonably expect to be worse off attempting to buy up as much as possible now than if it were gone. (This could happen if their attempt to buy caused the price to rise too fast relative to their ability to acquire additional bitcoins, to the point that they ultimately had less influence over the future Bitcoin economy than they have over the economy of today.) Thus, the agency problem with Bitcoin affects bitcoin competitors as well as Bitcoin holders._
_Nearly any government agent who begins to see bitcoin as a potential threat must also simultaneously see it as an opportunity. He, too, can invest in Bitcoin. And why shouldn’t he? Bitcoin may be a threat to his livelihood, but it may well be making him an offer he can’t refuse. How can an organization that stands to lose by the adoption of Bitcoin provide its members with a better opportunity for staying loyal than Bitcoin provides for defection?_
_Even those who might resist the temptation to defect would have to think about the defection of his fellows. How quickly is adoption happening? Is there time to mount an attack before Bitcoin becomes too powerful? How easily could the resources for such an attack be amassed, given both the ignorance and treachery of the other agents. If such an attack would be unlikely to succeed, then buying now would be the only intelligent action. Regardless of whether he liked Bitcoin, it would be futile to continue pursuing a doomed cause._
_Potential Bitcoin attackers are in a Prisoner’s Dilemma. In the same way that the people cannot easily rebel against the king owing to a lack of coordination on their part, governments cannot rebel against Bitcoin for the same reason. The government puts the people in a Prisoner’s Dilemma against one another, and Bitcoin does the same to government agents._
_Bitcoin is like Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Bitcoin attracts inside men to act as covert saboteurs. There have long been predictions from both bitcoiners and naysayers of impending government attacks, but I think there is a possibility that Bitcoin could win without suffering much resistance. Moreover, although I said above only that any legal bitcoin attack could be perverted, the considerations discussed in this section tend to make such diffusion very likely._
_Bitcoin defends itself by being obscure, but once it has attracted someone’s attention, its best interest is for that person to understand the logic presented here. For then he will also understand that his best course is to deny Bitcoin’s threat to his superiors and quietly to become its willing slave._

Customer Service:  Hello?
Customer: Hi!  I'm freaking out.  My son downloaded some kind of virus to my computer and my Bitcoin was stored on there.  It wont even boot up now.
Customer Service:  Are you a customer of IronClad? 
Customer:  Yes, we bought the Bitcoins through you.
Customer Service:  So you downloaded our app onto your smartphone right?
Customer:  Yes, I have it here.
Customer Service:  Great.  Please open it up and tell me what the balance says.
Customer:  Ok.  It says 31 Bitcoin.  So can the virus steal my Bitcoin since its on the computer?
Customer Service:  Thats impossible maam.  He would need your cell phone too.  When you get rid of the virus or get a new PC, just re-download our app and we will give you a phrase to type in and you can start using the IronCladd wallet again from your PC.
Customer:  So is the Bitcoin on my phone?   
Customer Service:  The Bitcoin is not on your phone or the PC.  Your coins are safe.
Customer:  If their not on my phone, then how is it that I spend Bitcoin everyday just using your app on my phone?
Customer Service:  If you remember, when you signed up, you stated that all purchases under 1 btc per day would be automatically approved, and an sms sent to you showing the purchase?
Customer:  Yes, I guess I do.
Customer Service:  Thats how we do it.  Now if you tried to spend 2 Btc a day, we would call you during the purchase and verify it using the magic word you entered when you purchased with us.
Customer:  Thanks :)

Understand that if Bitcoin succeeds, the dollar most likely will have failed as a world reserve currency; hence you will most likely be asking how many bits your dollar is worth.
And most people are missing the velocity part of monetary growth.  The dollar has a velocity of about 1-1.5, Bitcoin is near infinite in theory which reduces the monetary quantity requirement when attempting to achieve a robust economy.  Money supply * Velocity =PT (fisher equation)

[I am sending this message from the year 2025. Things are looking bleak here, and some of you will carry blood on your hands.]( 
If you don't believe me, please move on, as I have no way of proving to you I'm really who I claim to be.
I don't want to waste any of your time, so I'm merely going to explain what happened.
On average, every year so far, the value of Bitcoin has increased by about a factor ten. From 0.1 dollar in 2010, to 1 dollar in 2011, to 10 dollar in 2012, to 100 dollar in 2013. From now on, there's a slight slowdown, as the value increased by a factor ten every two years, to 1,000 dollar in 2015, to 10,000 in 2017, 100,000 in 2019, and 1,000,000 in 2021. From here onwards, there's no good way of expressing its value in dollars, as the dollar is no longer used, nor is any central bank issued currency for that matter. There are two main forms of wealth in today's world. Land and cryptocurrency.
There are just over 19 million Bitcoin known to be used in the world today, as well as a few hundred thousand that were permanently lost, and we're still dealing with a population of just over 7 billion people today. On average, this means the average person owns just under 0.003 bitcoin. However, due to the unequal distribution of wealth in my world, the mean person owns just 0.001 bitcoin. That's right, most of you reading this today are rich. I personally live next to an annoying young man who logged into his old Reddit account two years ago and discovered that he received a tip of 0.01 Bitcoin back in 2013 for calling someone a "faggot" when he was a 16 year old boy. Upon making this discovery he bought an airline ticket, left his house without telling anyone anything and went to a Citadel.
"What is a Citadel?" you might wonder. Well, by the time Bitcoin became worth 10,000 dollars, services began to emerge for the "Bitcoin rich" to protect themselves as well as their wealth. It started with expensive safes, then began to include bodyguards, and today, "earlies" (our term for early adapters), as well as those rich whose wealth survived the "transition" live in isolated gated cities called Citadels, where most work is automated. Most such Citadels are born out of the fortification used to protect places where Bitcoin mining machines are located. The company known as ASICminer to you is known to me as a city where Mr. Friedman rules as a king.
In my world, soon to be your world, most governments no longer exist, as Bitcoin transactions are done anonymously and thus most governments can enforce no taxation on their citizens. Most of the success of Bitcoin is due to the fact that Bitcoin turned out to be an effective method to hide your wealth from the government. Whereas people entering "rogue states" like Luxemberg, Monaco and Liechtenstein were followed by unmanned drones to ensure that governments know who is hiding wealth, no such option was available to stop people from hiding their money in Bitcoin.
Governments tried to stay relevant in my society by buying Bitcoin, which just made the problem worse, by increasing the value of Bitcoin. Governments did so in secret of course, but my generation's "Snowdens" are in fact greedy government employees who transferred Bitcoin to their own private account, and escaped to anarchic places where no questions are asked as long as you can cough up some money.
The four institutions with the largest still accessible Bitcoin balance are believed to be as following:
-ASICminer - 50,000 Bitcoin
-The IMF's "currency stabilization fund" - 70,000 Bitcoin
-Government of Saudi Arabia - 110,000 Bitcoin
-The North Korean government - 180,000 Bitcoin
Economic growth today is about -2% per year. Why is this? If you own more than 0.01 Bitcoin, chances are you don't do anything with your money. There is no inflation, and thus no incentive to invest your money. Just like the medieval ages had no significant economic growth, as wealth was measured in gold, our society has no economic growth either, as people know their 0.01 Bitcoin will be enough to last them a lifetime. The fact that there are still new Bitcoin released is what prevents our world from collapse so far it seems, but people fear that the decline in inflation that will occur during the next block halving may further wreck our economy.
What happened to the Winklevoss twins? The Winklevoss twins were among the first to die. After seeing the enormous damage done to the fabric of society, terrorist movements emerged that sought to hunt down and murder anyone known to have a large balance of Bitcoin, or believed to be responsible in any way for the development of cryptocurrency. Ironically, these terrorist movements use Bitcoin to anonymously fund their operations.
Most people who own any significant amount of Bitcoin no longer speak to their families and lost their friends, because they had to change their identities. There have been also been a few suicides of people who could not handle the guilt after seeing what happened to the bag-holders, the type of skeptical people who continued to believe it would eventually collapse, even after hearing the rumors of governments buying Bitcoin. Many people were taken hostage, and thus, it is suspected that 25% percent of "Bitcoin rich" actually physically tortured someone to get him to spill his password.
Why didn't we abandon Bitcoin, and move to another system? Well, we tried of course. We tried to step over to an inflationary cryptocurrency, but nobody with an IQ above 70 was willing to step up first and volunteer. After all, why would you voluntarily invest a lot of your money into a currency where you know your wealth will continually decline? The thing that made Bitcoin so dangerous to society was also what made it so successful. Bitcoin allows us to give into our greed.
In Africa, surveys show that an estimated 70% of people believe that Bitcoin was invented by the devil himself. There's a reason for this. It's a very sensitive issue that today is generally referred to as "the tragedy". The African Union had ambitious plans to help its citizens be ready to step over to Bitcoin. Governments gave their own citizens cell phones for free, tied to their government ID, and thus government sought to integrate Bitcoin into their economy. All went well, until "the tragedy" that is. A criminal organization, believed to be located in Russia, exploited a hardware fault in the government issued cell phones. It's believed that the entire continent of Africa lost an estimated 60% of its wealth in a period of 48 hours. What followed was a period of chaos and civil war, until the Saudi Arabian and North Korean governments, two of the world's major superpowers due to their authoritarian political system's unique ability to adapt to the "Bitcoin challenge", divided most African land between themselves and were praised as heroes by the local African population for it.
You might wonder, what is our plan now? It's clear that the current situation can not be sustained, without ending in a nuclear holocaust. I am part of an underground network, who seek to launch a coordinated attack against the very infrastructure of the Internet itself. We have at our disposal about 20 nuclear submarines, which we will use to cut all underwater cables between different continents. After this has been successfully achieved, we will launch a simultaneous nuclear pulse attack on every densely population area of the world. We believe that the resulting chaos will allow the world's population to rise up in revolt, and destroy as many computers out there as possible, until we reach the point where Bitcoin loses any relevance.
Of course, this outcome will likely lead to billions of deaths. This is a price we are forced to pay, to avoid the eternal enslavement of humanity to a tiny elite.
This is also the reason we contacted you.
It doesn't have to be like this. You do not have to share our fate. I don't know how, but you must find a way to destroy this godforsaken project in its infancy. I know this is a difficult thing to ask of you. You believed you were helping the world by eliminating the central banking cartel that governs your economies.
However, I have seen where it ends.

Limiting the supply of Bitcoin beyond what it is today, at present demand; would not probably, but definitely increase its price.
You are attempting to unpack what Bitcoin users want Bitcoin for, which is a futile(it could be store of value/gold, speculation, Silk Road, startups using it for some yet unannounced reason)
The demand for a Bitcoin is $290 a coin.  Limit the supply further WILL increase the price IF demand is the same.
You can attempt to paint the picture differently, but that is basic economics.
Edit: if you are implying that demand for Bitcoin at a certain price would drop because it is not a "needed" commodity, then demand would drop.  I stated clearly, **if demand stays the same**

My implication is that you already pay taxes.
My implication to my fellow human beings is that you have felt the pain of being a wage slave and feel others should suffer just like you.
So many people have the attitude that if someone studies art or philosophy or just checks out of life and plays video games, they deserve to suffer.
I have worked since I was 16 years old.  Factories, service industry, started an IT business in my 20s, programmer as an employee 20s-30s, IT consultant til 40.  I have worked every day of my life.
I am saying, others shouldnt have to.  
We pay taxes (I pay 46%) already.  I think "welfare" in the ways we distribute it is terrible.  I believe every single citizen should get a living wage.  Thats very different than food coupons and housing projects.
Give people dignity.  If you give a crackhead a living wage, he will continue being a crackhead.  Why do you feel slighted by that?  He is suffering more than you.  Yes, an extremely tiny portion of your yearly wage is going to that individual but i fail to understand why, when say 80-90% of what you are donating to society, is going to people who really want to be an impressionist painter or a philosopher or history teacher.
This post can go on forever, but I will cut it short.  I believe in free markets (in a very libertarian/austrian sense) but above all of this, I believe humans should have the dignity and freedom to find their personal legacy without the yolk of wage slavery.
edit:  and if that means that janitors and garbage men become scarce, then the markets will work their magic and make those occupations valuable.

Im personally curious about merchant adoption in Caracas.
Are there any merchants accepting Bitcoin at "brick &amp; mortar" shops?  Like a food mart? How about rent/electricity for Bitcoin?
Once this happens, in any location around the world, digitally skilled (programmers, graphics artists etc) can literally survive only on Bitcoin (without exchange into fiat).  The "circle" would be closed.
I work for a company that hires a lot of Ukraine programmers (in the millions of dollars range), they go through the exchange hoops to pay them.

Nearly impossible without the user blabbering about something or him/her actually transacting with you. 
edit:  and those of you stating "Well, exchanges require ID so they know who you are" then ye.. If you happen to work for an exchange and unethically search through transactions.  Thats like .0000000001% of the world's population then those people have to do what those exchange owners specifically disallow (arbitrarily linking transactions to track a user).
If you work for the NSA/FBI ye, they can probably track you.  But the **OP asked in the context of the average person not the NSA specialist or the Coinbase programmer who has access to all personal data**

2)  After the paper wallet is sent out, the people who sent it still have the private key and can play a game where they move the coins to another address within a certain time window (like, it takes approx 2 days to get to you, they move it the first hour of the second day)
3)  Instead of going through all this trouble, just take a selfie + utility bill and send it to Circle/Coinbase/Safello and get coin instantly/4 days?

2016 -  debtors that can't pay creditors-&gt;???-&gt; ???-&gt;stock crisis || currency crisis (runaway inflation takes hold, 20% for example)?(no faith in the US dollar-The Federal Reserve cannot create money to help since the money they create is suffering from 20% inflation.  Every dollar they print will just create more inflation (pouring gas on the fire))-&gt;All money leaving the stock market/bond market/treasuries(the dollar)-&gt;Need to put money in "hard assets"-cash is going to be worthless due to skyrocketing inflation - so Gold skyrockets, Bitcoin skyrockets, land/factories/production/any hard asset skyrockets (money frantically leaving, belief that cash is going to be worthless)
None of this will happen if the dollar is strong.  People would rather own dollars (if the stock market tanks, people will cash in and just put their cash in a savings account if the dollar is strong).  Only if there is a currency crisis (US dollar gets struck by runaway inflation) will the 2016 scenario i described occur.

First off, Bitcoin is not fiat.  It is not a useless token that is forced upon people via taxes and the judicial system as damage payment.
Bitcoin's value is intrinsic.  Any owner of any piece of Bitcoin has the ability to move that value to any other owner anywhere in the world (PayPal is built in and free).  There will only ever be 21 million Bitcoin so it is more scarce than gold.
Bitcoin is estimated to have 5 million holders/users not because a sovereign forced it on them, it's because they find it valuable.
If I had to choose between having an ounce of gold, $1400 or 1 Bitcoin with the condition I would receive it in 10 years, I would choose a Bitcoin.

They dont do so now, and much of what we are talking about will only happen during a financial crisis.
Things are "great" now.
Money is cheap and asset prices are breaking records every day.
With these conditions, citizens might agree cash seems a primitive instrument to continue carrying around since we use our cards for everything anyways.
But what we are trying to express, is that conditions havent always been this "good" (I put quotes around these words purposefully to express sarcasm, since 0 percent interest rates is actually poisonous to a macro financial environment) and they wont always be this "good".
Banks are businesses like any other.  They have liabilities and assets just as any other institution (By the way, if your loans are greater than your deposits/assets, you are a liability to a bank).  
If, for any reason, a bank cannot balance their books, they can "seize" money from your accounts (remember, you now have volunatarily given up your "cash" option - you cannot run to the bank and withdraw "cash" because cash doesnt exist).
Your Riksbank pretty much mimics the actions of the US Fed (you did your own QE in 2008, just as the Fed started theirs later).  A US crisis will affect the global economy.  
What we are expressing is that today's conditions are fine, it's when the economy tanks (most agree it will, it's part of the business cycle when you have central bankers dictating monetary policy) that you will regret not having the cash option.
Removing cash doesn't hurt criminals, it hurts the average citizen.
They (the bank lobbyists) will use money laundering and drugs/hookers as the excuse to take away your cash, but what they really want is the ability to take away your money when their business is bankrupt (survival)

It is nearly impossible for any entity, including the government, to prove you own a digital currency.
Of course, the first thing you think of is exchanges, that dirty filthy point at which your fiat currency touches Bitcoin.  They have your smiling selfie, utility bill and any other KYC/AML document to link your purchase to them.
They can prove you purchased it, but can never prove you profitted from it OR actually have it still.  Move it one time after it is in your wallet and you can always say you gave it away for no profit and it is no longer yours (I WAS INFECTED BY A VIRUS THAT MADE ME PAY A FEE!).
So ye, it is nearly impossible for anyone to actually prove you own digital currency.  Governments do not usually break into your house SWAT/Ross Ulbricht style and grab your laptop before you close it.

MV = PT (the Fisher Equation)
Each variable denotes the following:
M = Money Supply 
V = Velocity of Circulation (the number of times money changes hands)
P = Average Price Level
T = Volume of Transactions of Goods and Services
In Q2 2012 the velocity of M2 (US dollar) (the most common measure of money supply) was 1.5676.
On average, a typical dollar value changed ownership 1 and a half times.  This is the speed (which is why they call it velocity) of the dollar (think rusted 1980 Pinto).
Bitcoin's velocity is near infinite with zero confirmation (think near speed of light).
They have to have trillions of dollars to support a global financial system (due to the dollar's piss poor speed).
Bitcoin needs a tiny fraction of that to support a world economy (100,000,000 satoshi per BTC).
**So yes, Bitcoin's money quantity is fixed.  It's velocity however is infinitely faster than any currency ever invented which directly influences the Quantity Theory of Money and counteracts any argument as to concerns over lack of flexibility due to limited supply (Quantity of Money x _Velocity_ = PT )**

Dollar exchange rates are listed for 2 reasons:  
1)  Most of what you are purchasing is priced in dollars, this allows users to see quickly whether they can afford an item (in the future, 5 years from now when things are priced in BTC, then showing this exchange rate is not valuable to this person)
2)  The dollar is the world reserve currency and asset investments are priced in dollars (think oil per barrel, stock valuations).  So people that buy Bitcoin as a "store of value" like you would do with a gold coin, want to see what their respective investments are worth in the most common way to do so in the free market; via the world reserve currency.

Privacy features. Transactions per second.  These are important issues that will come to the forefront when Bitcoin is used for everyday transacting.
Right now Bitcoin's price is a direct result of people with money securing their wealth or speculation.  The price increase isnt because retailers started accepting it or STEAM transactions have gone through the roof.  Bitcoins popularity is increasing because 
there are countries who are fucking up their own currency.
there are millions of people speculating on Bitcoin to make quick money.
There are thousands of wealthy people getting money out of the exposed underbelly of the markets that get gutted when geo-political turmoil ensues.
There are Bitcoin "believers" that buy Bitcoin, then hold it causing demand pressure since it is a finite resource.
in my opinion, its all about safety/trust.  If Bitcoin appears untrustworthy (if Bitcoin pisses off its miners for example-who actively protect the coin) my money and any other people who have real money invested in it will move immediately out.  
Bitcoin is trusted because in the back of the mind of people like me, we imagine factories of ASICs owned by businessmen running 24/7 actively protecting the protocol. 
Do not underestimate how much I care about my money.
If we lose trust in Bitcoin then it is MySpace. If Bitcoin is that thing that is safe (I dont care about market fluctuations, I mean safe in terms of protocol-dont mess with 21 million. Dont mess with 10 minute heartbeat.  Cryptography isnt broken etc) then it is Facebook.

Not 1 worthless QE dollar was invested in Bitcoin.  Not 1.
QE's genesis (the creation of over 4 trillion dollars) starts and stops at the investment banks.  The article insinuates that investment banks (Goldman Sachs for example) invested in Bitcoin.  Goldman Sachs and their brethren did the following with the money:  Let it sit in their computers gaining 3% interest (the fed allowed an interest rate to be attached to QE money which is the first time in history it has done this for newly created money.  Think Bitcoin where if a miner received a 25 BTC block reward, the BTC itself would increase if the miner never moved it from the bitcoin address it was sent to), invested in treasuries, invested in Bonds (including junk bonds), invested in the stock market and other commodities, real estate and a tiny amount was given to commercial banks for lending (to put you in further debt).  If even .01% ($400,000,000) was injected into the Bitcoin economy we would have no choice but be looking at &gt;$10000 per coin

Been "into" bitcoin for 2 years.
Why did you "get into" bitcoin?  Be honest with yourself.
The price.
Why arent merchants accepting Bitcoin?  Because they dont want it.
And the merchants that "accept" bitcoin take your bitcoin and immediately sell it.
The answer imho?
Hold.  The price will save us.  When the price goes from $200-$400-$900-$2000-$20000 How will you, as a merchant, react to this?
Yes its volatile, but volatile going UP.
Merchants will not sell Bitcoin at that point.  Because they suddenly WANT IT.
They want it like they want you to buy a cup of coffee with a real gold coin instead of the paper dollar.
When we get there, merchants will discount their products for Bitcoin.  Until then, hold.

Your entire rant is you trying to deceive people into thinking you know why people buy Bitcoin.
There are not a dozen reasons, there are hundreds, possibly thousands of individually specific reasons why people want bitcoins.
A free market's superpower is price finding. The Bitcoin supply/demand price, as of now, is $290.  You can attempt to discredit this price, but here is another lesson in economics: the market is smarter than you.
If demand stays the same of any commodity and the supply goes down, the price has no where to go but up.
If the consumers feel a price is too high for what they want it for, demand stops at a certain price, and will drop.

_Nearly any government agent who begins to see bitcoin as a potential threat must also simultaneously see it as an opportunity. He, too, can invest in Bitcoin. And why shouldn’t he? Bitcoin may be a threat to his livelihood, but it may well be making him an offer he can’t refuse. How can an organization that stands to lose by the adoption of Bitcoin provide its members with a better opportunity for staying loyal than Bitcoin provides for defection?_
_Even those who might resist the temptation to defect would have to think about the defection of his fellows. How quickly is adoption happening? Is there time to mount an attack before Bitcoin becomes too powerful? How easily could the resources for such an attack be amassed, given both the ignorance and treachery of the other agents. If such an attack would be unlikely to succeed, then buying now would be the only intelligent action. Regardless of whether he liked Bitcoin, it would be futile to continue pursuing a doomed cause._
_Potential Bitcoin attackers are in a Prisoner’s Dilemma. In the same way that the people cannot easily rebel against the king owing to a lack of coordination on their part, governments cannot rebel against Bitcoin for the same reason. The government puts the people in a Prisoner’s Dilemma against one another, and Bitcoin does the same to government agents._
_Bitcoin is like Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Bitcoin attracts inside men to act as covert saboteurs. There have long been predictions from both bitcoiners and naysayers of impending government attacks, but I think there is a possibility that Bitcoin could win without suffering much resistance. Moreover, although I said above only that any legal bitcoin attack could be perverted, the considerations discussed in this section tend to make such diffusion very likely._
_Bitcoin defends itself by being obscure, but once it has attracted someone’s attention, its best interest is for that person to understand the logic presented here. For then he will also understand that his best course is to deny Bitcoin’s threat to his superiors and quietly to become its willing slave._

You want address mixing in the core code, so do I.  But Dark Wallet is extremely promising.  If it succeeds (so far it looks like they are on track) then mixing will be a wallet type.
If you had 100 BTC or 100,000 BTC, clicking one button to mix them would be the difference between core implementation and protocol level implementation.
Understand, the concepts may seem complex, but the user interfaces should be extremely easy and look "under the hood" ish.

Just a couple things, because I have listened to Peter Schiff for a couple years now and respect and admire his stance against the Fed.
Peter Schiff doesn't understand Bitcoin.  His main reason for disliking Bitcoin is because he thinks Bitcoin is not scarce because there are so many alt coins (its like saying gold is worthless because there is so much silver and mercury).  
Give the guy a break, hes an old guy that has believed and espoused gold his entire life.  Breaking down walls that have been meticulously and passionately built up for years is hard to do.
In the words of Jim Rickards "watch what they do, not what they say".
Peter Schiff accepts Bitcoin for gold.

Good read, minus some grammar mistakes was still insightful.
Couple things though.


How do you come to this conclusion?
It is my belief that the Fed will definitely start a QE4 and not raise interest rates until 2017.
The analogy I like to use about QE is it is like training wheels on a bike.  The big question is, does the bike have any wheels at all when you remove the training wheels.
The answer to that question will come when the fed increases the interest rate.  The bike will either tip over or move.

It is held in "reserve" collecting interest (first time in history of the Fed that they allowed for interest to be paid on newly created money balance.  This is truly uncharted territory)
The following graph shows investment bank reserves (circa 3 trillion) (remember investment banks get the money, not the small private commercial bank you get a car loan from)
The last 1 trillion was invested in RATED assests (assets that are exposed via stock/equity markets-&gt;answers the question as to why a bitcoin ETF is so important), also treasuries, bonds, real estate and a miniscule (extremely miniscule amount) is lent to people to put them further in debt via mortgages, student loans etc)
A large part of why there is so little lending is everyone is de-leveraging now (paying down debt) and do not WANT more debt (they already got enough of it)

We both agree that mixing at the core code level would be ideal and we also agree that people need absolute simplicity.
 
Simplicity and my description on how I envision Bitcoin's evolution are not mutually exclusive.
Coin insurance, security and simplicity can and I believe will be implemented in a client side banking tool.
You do understand that no "coins" in bitcoin are ever on your actual machine?  
Also, you do understand that coins have no "serial number", its the transactions that do.  Therefor, if the government says my bitcoin "has AIDS" I can spread aids to every single bitcoin address in existence for under half a BTC and I can write that tool in less than 1 hour.
I also believe that within the banking client there will be integrated stock/asset trading

I think incentivizing nodes to actually run is a better way to prevent sybil attacks than elevating certain nodes to "elite citizen" status.
What I would like to see from a high level point of view is, if you are running a full node, the balance in the core's wallet collects interest (like a savings account).
The number of full nodes would increase exponentially and a sybil attack would be untenable.

When the crash occurs, the money will flow to commodities that are difficult/hard for someone to take away from you.
Please look at financial system collapse not from the context of someone who holds very little wealth, but from someone who has above average wealth.  The reason I say this, is that someone with very little wealth, after a financial system collapse, has less wealth; therefor he/she affects the market very little.
It is the people who have something to lose that move markets.  They try and save their wealth by moving it from seizable assets (stocks, bonds) to assets that can be hidden from the collapsing system (physical gold/cash/and now Bitcoin).  This is called "capital flight".
If a financial system collaps occurs, there is a chance Bitcoin's market price will increase exponentially.  I have, in many threads here, often stated that Bitcoin's meteoric rise in value will occur due to its store of value rather than its medium of exchange.

I am ideologically on both sides of the spectrum.  I havent made up my mind as to whether the Bitcoin Foundation is good or bad for Bitcoin.  I almost voted for Cody.  I wasn't convinced by him after the Lets talk bitcoin podcast where they discussed their views.
Instead, I went with Oliver and Jim.  Oliver was my "far left" vote, Jim my "far right".
Oliver wants transparency (streaming of BF meetings, no secret dealings) and a more egalitarian method of donating to the core protocol and I am all for this (who wouldnt be?).  I made no claims that I am convinced Oliver is a "genius".  I just believe he is sincere.  He has a fortune which means he has "skin in the game".  I believe that he believes as I do.  The vote for him was easy.
And again, I see Jim as a "plugged in" guy who brings legitimacy and gives "us" a better chance to succeed.

A massive deflationary event would have occurred if the big banks failed.
QE prevented that.  
QE=stock market, treasuries, bonds, real estate (bubbles)
No-QE=Gold, Railroads, Oil, Factories, Bitcoin, Art (capital flight/wealth preservation)
Edit:  The Winkelvii are "believers".  They would be in because they **believe** in the technology.  If the banks failed and no QE occurred, they may not have invested as much, but standing where we are now; listening and believing what they say is sincere, we cannot deny they would have invested something.  
The main point is, if QE never occurred, Bitcoin would not need Winkelvii millionaires.  Because Bitcoin would have billionaires.
Edit 2:  please read this article before replying. 
QE money is not cash, it is given to banks to either lend or invest in assets (the kind of assets that have a Standard &amp; Poors rating).  Not only is QE money not likely to have affected Bitcoin AT ALL,  it is nearly impossible since there is no investment vehicle in existence (ETF) that   allows for a QE investment.  The bank's have lent out .00001% of the QE so if you are implying some guy out there went to a bank and took out a million dollar loan to "rock the bitcoin market", you are either in a self induced state of confusion or smoking something good.

Gold and Bitcoin would survive precisely because of this.  Look at your history.  
In each of the four deflationary periods since the 17th century in England, gold has increased its purchasing power, by between 42 percent (1658-1669) and 251 percent (1920-1933).
In the U.S. there have been three recorded deflationary periods - and gold increased its purchasing power in each of them - by between 44 percent (1929-1933) and 100 percent (1814-1830).
Gold and hard commodities (like Bitcoin) are the go to assets during nervous economic periods.

I dont have to narrate satoshi's vision.  He spoke quite lucidly himself
_The existing Visa credit card network processes about 15 million Internet purchases per day worldwide. Bitcoin can already scale much larger than that with existing hardware for a fraction of the cost. It never really hits a scale ceiling. If you're interested, I can go over the ways it would cope with extreme size. By Moore's Law, we can expect hardware speed to be 10 times faster in 5 years and 100 times faster in 10. Even if Bitcoin grows at crazy adoption rates, I think computer speeds will stay ahead of the number of transactions._

The profit to Bitcoin comes in the form of capital flight, not in Greece "adopting" bitcoin.
If Greece adopts the drachma, the drachma will start in a 1 to 1 conversion with the Euro but will immediately drop due to the market.
Greece will start printing (exponentially, not linear) drachmas to pay its debts.  This is the fragile time period.  The Greek central bank has to be careful and not print too much.  Inflation will cause everyone's savings to lose value.
When my $100,000 worth of Drachma loses 30% of its value in 2 months, I need a way out of this mess.  If capital controls are enforced to prevent capital flight, I would have to become a "criminal" to save the wealth I worked my ass off for.
If Bitcoin takes even 2% of this (of the thousands trying to save their accumulated wealth), we will see a serious uptick in our market price.
It is Bitcoin's "store of value" not its medium of exchange that will spark its meteoric rise I believe.

Centralization was caused by pool mining not block size
And I am not here defending BitMain.  And I want segwit activated.  But I also want a major blocksize increase, not this 2mb talk.


They know increasing the blocksize will create lower fees, but refuse to do so.  They claim it will cause centralization but they provide no proof of this.  One thing we know is that they want lightning network.  Lightning network is NOT Bitcoin.  It is a layer above that they will profit from.  Conflict of interest right?

Which is probably why it is not happening.

Masternodes do not exist in Bitcoin either, in DarkCoin yes but not Bitcoin.
I am saying the idea of having an "aristocracy" in Bitcoin nodes is not an elegant solution to the problem.
A more elegant solution is to incetivize the running of a full node.  I think we should put our resources behind that idea instead of creating "first class" nodes and peasant nodes in bitcoin.
As Andreas Antonopolous says, simple centralization as an answer to a problem usually appears like the correct answer to our primitive monkey brains; but it is always the wrong answer.  And I tend to agree with that.

I agree.  Gold had a "use case", jewelry; add to that its divisibility, scarcity, fungibility and hard to counterfeit properties and it became an amazing form of money.
It eventually failed because, as you say, it couldnt handle the load (it couldnt handle being "money" for such a large population) and for a variety of other reasons.
Bitcoin is everything gold is but better.
Its even more divisible than gold, powers of magnitude better at divisibility, powers of magnitude harder to counterfeit, powers of magnitude easier to transfer and powers of magnitude cheaper to mine.
Add to this, bitcoin is even more scarce than gold (but is easy to divide!) and we dont have to worry about an asteroid hitting earth adding 40000 tons of gold tanking the price.
So ye, I agree!
And if you worked 40 years, tirelessly accumulating wealth via your own sweat and tears; the government cannot seize your bitcoin as easily as it can your gold.
Just memorize a 12 word sentence and use that as your private key, stick your 20,000 BTC in there, cross the border.  Voila.

Your trezor holds the key to one of the safes in the clouds.  The address of the safe "Safe  in Cloud 23232323" is just an address.  But the safe is impossible to open.  The key is in your trezor in your safety deposit box.
I dont know if that made sense.  Just imagine trezor is the key.  The safe holding the value is actually in the clouds.  But the value may as well be regarded in the trezor since the safe is impossible to open without the key.

The key is just a number.
No one in the universe will ever guess the number.
Choose a number in your head right now.  That is a Bitcoin private key.  Take that number, run it through elliptical curve-sha256-ripmd and you have a public key that i can send money to.
The "key" is just a number.
When you click "create bitcoin wallet" button in any bitcoin wallet, it just picks a number.
You dont need the internet.  Just pick a number.  Thats a key where you can store a million dollars.
The "key" doesnt "get to the trezor" since the "key" was created on the trezor.  :)

Gavin would have increased the blocksize in 2016 then there would be minor problems.  He would have fixed them immediately then started working on privacy.
Yesterday's weather. That's how it always was with Gavin. Delivered a tad too fast. Always needed tweaking. We never really suffered because he owned it and made sure it worked out (even the hard fork)

That is a win for miners, not for UASFers.
Miners can still exchange their coins for cash to pay their electric bills.
The only way UASF succeeds is if you strangle miners.
Personally I dont support UASF.  I want bigger blocks and segwit and lightning and removal of asicboost or making it standard in core.
@_date: 2017-06-09 07:15:10
Segwit fixes 2 bugs.  Thats great.  
The accidental scaling baked into segwit is no excuse for an actual scaling solution.
Raising the blocksize is.

@_date: 2017-06-11 10:34:03
Imo, go 50/50 Bitcoin and ethereum.
If Bitcoin fails due to governance, the coin that will inherit the sell off is ethereum.
If Bitcoin doesn't fail, ether will most likely continue to rise, just not as fast.
and regarding when
There is likely going to be some volatility in july as august 1st approaches.  no one knows if there is a drop, where the floor will be.
i would buy immediately.  the reasoning is, regardless of the volatility that may strike the bitcoin space in july as august 1st uasf approaches, i think the geopolitical turmoil and macro economic outlook of the world is exhibiting far more symptoms of stress than bitcoin is.
when the world economy explodes, the escape raft will be cryptocurrencies
and when it actually happens it will be too late.
and even if you think it wont happen (even though, like clockwork it happens every 7-8 years) ethereum and btc has been rising steadily the past year, so the best price is most likely todays price (if there is volatility in july, your ether will rise to make up for it).

It doesn't happen in the first place with Bitcoin.
My kids get Bitcoin and only use it when they buy something so the steam balance is always zero.
With a credit card, it's fully ready to be charged crazy amounts 24/7
And it's a fallacy that chargeback are easy and straightforward.
My son bought minecraft on the Xbox store without my permission using my cc (it is associated with my account which is required).
I tried to chargeback.  Microsoft said if I did I would be banned from using their Xbox live.

Blockstream is the largest contributor in terms of both money and resources to core.


They have not raised the blocksize


Their business is lightning network amongst other things.  The vision that Blockstream has made clear is that Bitcoin's blockchain should just be a settlement network.  In their minds, less people using Bitcoin makes Bitcoin better.


I dont want Bitcoin to be just a settlement network. Thats what I am fighting for.

me personally, i like to have my btc on a trezor hardware wallet.
if i didnt have a trezor hardware wallet then maybe an offline iphone with bwallet in a safety deposit box or safe
I dont trust any exchange with my bitcoin.  not even coinbase.
Its 2021.  Your bitcoin exchange business is booming. you have 332 employees. every day is the same. your company makes good money. Bitcoin just hit a million dollars a coin.  Suddenly, through some procedural niche that was never really vetted previously, you have access to 449 bitcoin as it moves through the workflow in your company.. 449 million dollars.  There are about 22 ways you could take that money and never get caught  ("Hackers!", "wHAT 449 btc?".."hackers&gt;zzz1")
Are you really that strong to resist that temptation?  449 million dollars untraceable. Are you willing to bet millions of dollars that he/she is?
Dont keep it on an exchange unless you dont know how to protect it yourself..
edit:  blockchain.info is the worst online wallet in the history of online wallets.  They lose customers bitcoin daily and [even have been known to write bad software that automates the losing of your btc](

1) It cannot be shut down.  Since there is no heart to stab, you have to go after the millions of users
2) See how well that worked out with file sharing (trillions of dollars later and the torrent/file sharing community still going strong)
3)  The Bitcoin price.  By the time we poke the bear, the bitcoin price will be so high that the temptation to come over to our side will be too significant to resist.  We truly are the new .o1%

The statement is actually an interesting one.
"The Trust Economy" is what it is describing.
I saw a lecture related to Bitcoin from a speaker, I forgot his name, but this person made a public appearence presenting Bitcoin.
This person described a situation where, after finishing his presenting activities, he departed to the airport.
At the airport, a person approached him and, appearing a bit "out of sorts" explained how he attended the presentation, was thoroughly impressed and described how he left his wallet in a taxi cab and was currently stranded at the airport.
The presenter, not knowing this individual, was of course skeptical of this person's story and asked a couple probing questions about the presentation to test if he actually was in the audience.
The desparate person answered coherently, but just to make sure, the presenter asked for his facebook/linkedin.
The desperate person added him in both social media sites and the presenter then perused his profiles and concluded this person was indeed who he said he was and gave him some money and was, of course, reimbursed later.
The point was, the internet truly birthed an unexpected trust vetting system we all have at our fingertips.  We all can do a very good credit check on each other in minutes.
To end this story I just would like to say,  nothing elicits more distrust than the entity they call EU.  We have a monetary policy that basically establishes master/slave relationships in Europe.  
Germany, France and Netherlands basically enforce austerity on the rest of Europe by lending them ridiculous amounts of money that they know they can never pay back, then enforce starvation budgets that moves resources in the form of natural resources, labor (brain drain) and the citizens wealth to the top EU export countries.
The single EU currency will probably fall apart within the next 10-15 years.  The adage "One cannot enforce monetary policy without being able to enforce a fiscal policy" is true and will lead to the Euro's demise in my opinion.
TLDR that poster is kinda interesting but do not trust the EU
