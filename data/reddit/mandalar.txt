Do you have a source on him being french ? I haven't found anything reliable and his name does not sound french (though this is no proof).

This is classical of bad french media (maybe not only french?). Anyone who is successful with computers / a good programmer / who did an IQ test classifying him "above average" is said to be a genius. They say "To the point of becoming a genius, even though his mother doesn't say the word".

He's mainly saying:
We want to be ready for when bitcoin (or any other alternative currency) bursts and everyone wants to use it, even if it is in 3-5 years.
The first to come would be the online store but he is open to do it for physical stores also and says the ETA could be the end of 2014.

I never used nor heard of your project before but thank you for doing it, for sharing it under an open source license, and don't let those angry users get you down since they are doing the trading with their own money.
