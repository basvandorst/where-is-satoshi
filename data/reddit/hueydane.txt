Not soon. First we need to update to Segwit and only then design a protocol that integrates Lightning. Bisq has a shortage of JAVA developers there's a lot in their plates.
@_date: 2019-07-07 02:08:40


Why is that?
@_date: 2019-07-05 21:31:17
BSQ is colored Bitcoin and 1 BSQ = 100 sats and if you are interested in more technical detail you can [look at the documentation here]( Therefore the theoretical cap on BSQ is 2,1×10¹³ units. Each cycle, contributor issue Compensation Requests and the DAO votes on whether to grant those contributors to the right to mint the BSQ they requested.
There's an incentive for those voting to not mindlessly grant minting rights as that would quickly inflate the token.

Hardware wallets provide a great balance between easy of use and security of seed generation. Coldcard, Trezor and Ledger are good ones.
A mnemonic seed phrase is a better paper wallet. Use that.

The fees depend on the weight of the transaction. So more inputs = more info that needs to be stored in that transaction. And it's calculated in satoshis per byte.

Well, the max trade duration is advertised when you create an account so that should factor into your expectations. Those limits are  set based on the fiat payment methods, so there's little Bisq can do.
@_date: 2019-07-06 12:00:46
I may be wrong but I think that it takes a week for Coinbase to release your funds to you. It may depend on the payment method though.
@_date: 2019-07-09 08:00:53
I guess that I'm assuming that if I noticed funds missing I would approach the Bisq community for help to find out how to solve it. And [I did so]( however my case was a little different as I was tinkering with Electrum and Bisq from the start.
But  your point of someone not noticing the missing funds, scraping Bisq without saving the seed phrase and only later realizing that they'd lost part of their funds is a valid one. I guess in my mind that seems so unlikely that I came off as dismissive. It's like if I deposited 100$ in my bank account and when I went to withdraw it there were only 80$. I'd immediately wonder what had happened.
I've been contributing for some months now to the project.

[One great review from MrHodl](
It depends on what you're looking for. Bisq had less liquidity and slower trades. So if you're just buying BTC regularly it may work fine for your needs. If you can leave your computer on for long periods it'll benefit you to make offers instead of taking them. [Here's some data on volume.](

You send your identifiers necessary for the payment method to the other trader so they can send you the fiat. So only them will have access to it. An arbitrator will also have access to your identifiers in case of a dispute.

Bisq requires a good connection at the start so it may be worth limiting the apps consuming your bandwidth. Maybe try to restart your computer and launch Bisq immediately after.

What's the most common payment method? Debit cards, credit cards, other?

@_date: 2019-07-06 12:55:09
Simplifying it, every transaction is a contract that says "This output can be spent by someone with the private key for this address".
The atomic element in Bitcoin's blockchain is the output. They are spent or unspent. In one transaction I can aggregate as many outputs as I want and spend them as long as I have the private key for them. And the both of us can create a single transaction where I sign the outputs I want to spend and you sign the one's you want to spend and broadcast it.
The information in the Bitcoin's blockchain is stored as a transactions, not addresses. Inside the transactions you can however find addresses.
@_date: 2019-07-07 13:20:56
In the period since the DAO was launched, XMR accounted for over 50% of the trades and over 90% of the BTC value. That said, the EUR, USD, GBP markets have for a while been steadily being used.
It's way easier to trade in high volumes between cryptocurrencies, thus XMR's popularity.
I get the phrase "nobody is using it" and understand its purpose. It has been said from the fiat world to the BTC world and from the BTC world to the altcoins world. But the simple answer is that **there are people using. They had a necessity and found a solution for it.**
@_date: 2019-07-05 21:07:32
I meant volume in monetary value, not in number of trades. But still, although since April 15th ([the launch of the Bisq DAO]( BSQ has been steadily being traded, it stills accounts for only a fraction of XMR's trades.

Allowing for a 0% security deposit seems doable. And there's work being done on an API to provide another way to interact with the Bisq node. But it doesn't seem like a node-less model will be available soon.
@_date: 2019-07-05 18:48:35
A staggering majority of the volume on Bisq is provided by XMR-BTC trades so higher volumes can more traded more safely.
@_date: 2019-07-09 07:13:56
That output isn't being spent without your authorization. The Bisq wallet simply is having trouble finding it. So as long as you have access to your seed phrase you have access to the funds.
This is indeed an issue and needs to be figured out.

@_date: 2019-10-12 10:43:20
It's really hard to get scammed as a BTC buyer on Bisq. The trade funds are locked in a 2-out-of-3 multisig and if the other trader behaves dishonestly, it'll go into arbitration and as long as you can prove that you made your payment, the arbitrator will release the funds to you.
Also, the BTC seller can only determine what percentage of the trade funds the BTC buyer should put as a security deposit. It isn't a fee as you'll get it back at the end of the trade. The trade fees are set in place and not decided trade by trade by the traders.

Very true, I stand corrected. It's only visible that it's a p2wsh

There were some scams in March/April. The bulk of it was due to chargebacks. BTC sellers saw the fiat they received as payment be returned. Looking at the behavior of troublesome offers in the Bisq Network, it seemed like there were hackers with multiple stolen fiat accounts buying bitcoin with other people funds. Some of these people requested chargeback once they found out.
The case above is quite different. OP is a BTC buyer, more importantly, they're trading fiat for BTC. They're the one presenting risk as fiat finality is terrible.
PS:bisq.community is more active than r/bisq and it can be searched for traders' issues.

Totally. With the advent of the Lightning Network and publicizing of people having a separate hardware dedicated to run their full node and lightning node, I feel like we should find a way to promote complementary services like the BTC RPC Explorer, Electrum Personal Server, Btcpay server and Bisq. And ways to connect to their personal server remotely, ideally through their mobile Electrum wallet.
People are running full nodes only in order to get access to Lightning Network and still using SPV wallets to connect to third party blockchain explorers when they have one sitting on their living room.
It'd be great if CASA, NODL and other companies in the space were to develop more whole devices.

There are different complaints regarding fees. But the more recent is that most wallets' fee calculators aren't that great. If you go to [ you'll see that often people are overpaying fees. In some cases, this is due to wallet manufacturers optimizing for simple UI/UX and not efficiency. And because fees are an active market where people set fees based on the probable fees other may set,  a bad actor or a poor designed wallet can cause rallies and increase fees to absurd amounts.
More than that, your anecdote doesn't prove/disprove anything. And an argument could be made that given how secure Bitcoin is, that the miners are being overpaid right now.

So you are the one selling? Let's say you have 1000BTC assigned to one address and you want to sell them in small amounts and not have the different trades connected. The best thing to do would be to run them through the Wasabi wallet's conjoin, splitting it it into smaller outputs assigned to different addresses.
Then use a mobile wallet that allows you to control the outputs to spend for each transaction. After that you'd need to not touch the change from each of those outputs, assuming you didn't spend the entire output and have them all go through Wasabi once again at the end and combine/split them into new outputs.
The send address isn't the priority here. Plus I imagine ATMs have some type of  KYC/AML, cameras. So you'd have to deal with that too.

Well, bitcoin transactions are very final. SEPA transfers not so much. So most central exchanges will require you to give then some personal information to satisfy their KYC (Know your customer) requirements. And if I'm not wrong, Coinbase will have you wait 7 days after they've assigned your bitcoins to you.
Alternatively, you can try [bisq.network]( which experience is much more like what you described.
@_date: 2019-04-18 21:42:19
OP needs to split their outputs and have them not connect going forward as to not connect the different BTC to fiat trade. The send address is of little relevance here.

I imagine this could be solved by generating a random integer for the index on each payment request instead of going 0, 1, 2, 3, etc. But then you'd probably need to keep track of the addresses requested and with some balance and do it in some encrypted way so that no one could intercept this info. And someone could just spam the request and fill you with a bunch of empty address to sort through. Yeah, it's not ideal if privacy is what I'm after.

At an average of 1MB per block you'd get around 144MBs/day and 50GBs/year.
@_date: 2019-05-26 23:24:57
I don't know if your analogy works here as, unlike your example, we don't know the total of the faces of the cube. Each miner/pool has a different block that will require different nonces.
In a room with a 100 people where each person can calculate 1hash/s the room has a total of 100h/s. But assuming that no two people are in a joint effort, that there's more transactions than can fit into one block in the waiting list and that each person will have different block, the hash power relevant to the difficulty is around 1h/s. And the difficulty should be 600.
If everything remains the same but all the people in the room are working together in a pool the hash power is 100h/s and the difficulty should be 60000.
