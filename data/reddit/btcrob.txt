Is buying Bitcoin illegal in Ireland?
Why not just tell your bank you used it to buy bitcoin, and they can politely fuck off.
Even if it's now their policy not to allow it, the transactions are already done. Not much they can do now.

Actually, this was a perfect example of how well TA works. Maybe you just don't know how to do it.
It was in a clear and significant wedge, and the huge drop happened only after it broke out of the wedge to the downside.
I made over $2000 in 2 hours because I shorted when it broke out of support. TA made that possible.
You can see what I mean here:
The strategy is simple. Buy at support, short at resistence, and if it breaks on either end, you go long or short as appropriate.
That's a 6 hr chart, btw.

Bear markets turn into bull markets just like bull markets turn into bear markets. That's how this works.
When all those willing to sell have sold, the market turns, price goes up, investors get excited again etc etc
This is how everything trades. Bitcoin is not unique in any way with regards to it's trading patterns.

Why not Bitfinex? Fees are crazy low and if you don't deal with fiat (I.e. you plan to both fund and withdraw in Bitxoin) you don't have to send any personal information in. Can sign up and be trading in a few minutes.
I'm a heavy trade so I qualify for a good fee rate, I pay nothing for adding liquidity and 0.05% to remove, but even the start up rates are something like 0.05% to add and 0.1% to remove (don't quote me, but it's around that area)

Tell them you've created this great new website called Bitconnect and you're gonna pay them suspiciously high interest rates if they send you all their bitcoin  and that it's definitely not a scam.
Tell them there's a "volatility software" if they ask too many questions.
In all seriousness, It actually seems like a fun idea. I'd probably go the gambling route. Set up wagers with students for things you think you have an advantage (sports, test scores etc). Can't think of a sound way to scam it out of them, especially when everyone going to be on high alert for that kind of thing.

I wouldn't say it's "wasting". Frankly, the ever increasing electricity required will provide price support.
All resources require resources/energy to get out of the ground. That's part of what gives them value. If electricity costs end up making Bitcoin unprofitable to mine, miners will simply stop. But demand for Bitcoin will remain the same, so steady demand + decreased supply means that prices will go up to a point that draws the miners back.

@_date: 2017-08-06 17:43:46
There's probably a myriad of factors that went into it. Certainly BIP 148 contributed. There was a lot of uncertainty heading into the fork though, and one thing investors hate is uncertainty. You'll often have stocks under a cloud of uncertainty  (say a lawsuit or somethijg) rally strongly as soon as the uncertainty is lifted, even if the news is bad, so long as there is clarity.
It became obvious pretry soon after the fork that the doom scenarios were not going to happen. And then the panic buying started the other day.

If Bitcoin relied on the ability of US taxpayers to evade their taxes, then it was a) doomed to fail from the beginning and b) a fucking shitty idea in the first place.
This kind of stuff is REQUIRED to propel Bitcoin to the next phase. The trillions of dollars of instutional money that is still largely on the sidelines is risk averse/conservative by nature. If Bitcoin ahs the reputation of used mainly by crooks and thieves, they'll never put their money into it.
@_date: 2017-08-25 18:05:50
Because clearly high fees for 2 days have no relationship with price? The market obviously realizes this is temporary and once BCH gets ruined from the poison pill that is the EDA, we get all the hash power again.

@_date: 2017-08-21 15:55:23
I don't see how BCH gets through this problem. Remembr we didn't even know if it would survive post fork. It did, because miners were willing to work at a loss in the beginning, ostensibly with the idea that they lose some money now, but recoup that at a later date. If those miners didn't work at a loss, BCH would have never gotten off the ground. But now, it's become clear that as soon as the difficulty changes, the chain gets flooded with hashpower (understandably) to take advantage of the high profitability.
So now that it's clear this is the dynamic, are those same miners going to be willing/able to mine BCH again at a loss after all the miners go back to BTC following the next difficultyu readjustment period in a few days? It's one thing to work at a loss when there's a light at the end of the tunnell. It's another thing entirely to work at a loss indefinitely, having the majority of the fruits of your labor siphoned off as soon as the difficulty changes.
To expect this to continue indefinitely is to expect a few miners being willing to absorb all of the losses while only recouping a small fraction of the profits. I just don't see that as a sustainable model.

You don't see how a technology that allows you to send huge amounts of wealth anywhere in the world, ignoring national borders, instantly, at costs far below existing wealth transfer methods, using only software that anybody can download for free in seconds would be incredibly useful?
I guess if you think that ppl have no interest in transferring wealth around, then sure, it has no value. If you think that maybe that's a useful thing, then Bitcoin offers clear superiority over existing methods. And humans tend to like superior products.

Demand FOR bitcoins is exceeding the supply OF bitcoins for sale. Thus, price increase.
@_date: 2017-08-28 13:40:41
I would say all that cost is what puts a hard price floor under the price of Bitcoin.
Any commodity generally won't go below the price of it's production. if it does, production slows (or stops) which removes supply, which boosts prices back up, until it's above the cost of production and producers can turn a profit again.
A large part of what gives a commodity value is the very FACT that it costs money to produce. If it didn't, there would be no reason to purchase that commodity from someone else.

Remember Bitcoin has almost a built in circuit breaker. It takes a few days to open an account, get verified, and fund it, and exchanges seem to be dealing with a large backlog too.
The money entering today is probably money that decided to buy Bitcoin last Monday, after it broke $3000 over last weekend.

No, the two things that cause time dilation are speed and gravity. All things being equal, an object moving faster will always experience time slower then a slower moving object, and an object in a stronger gravitational field will always experience time slower then an object in a weaker one.
Remember that scene in Interstellar where they go on the planet near the black hole and 1 hour equates to 7 years back on Earth? It's because of the increased gravity of the nearby black hole.
Now, mining on or near Jupiter or the Sun or some other high gravity location would do the trick, in theory. Of course the extra cost of propulsion might make it not feasible

While the technology is complex, you don't really.need to get that deep in the weeds to be part of the revolution.

Today could very well be the bottom. Or it oculd go to $2000 before it goes above $3000.

And there was no fork? Lol what pamnet are you on? If you want to actually have a debate on something you need to at least accept the basic fundamental facts of the situation.

No, of course it won't ever be the worlds only asset class. That's absurd and anybody who think sit will happen is vastly ignorant of the complexity and nuance of the global finanical system.
I agree with the poster who says it will likely carve out a space roughly around 10% of global assets. That would mean trillions in market cap, and coins worth well into the 6 figures, if not 7.

Nobodys really using Bitcoin for transactions now.
Bitcoin is like the Internet. The 90's was on CNN last night, and it was interesting how all the ppl interviewed back then about the internet were so wrong in how the internet would mostly be used ("electronic mail" was the primary use). Once a transcendent technology comes into broad use, nobody gets to dictate how it will be used, and often times it's used in ways very different then when it was envisioned.
I personally don't think BTC will ever be used as a medium of exchange in any significant scale. So far, the evolution of Bitcoin itself bears this out. Nobody wants to spend it, it's percieved future value is too much. This is by design. I just don't think ppl will use a deflationary currency that will be worth more tomorrow to conduct everyday business when they can much more easily use an inflationary currency that will be worth less tomorrow for the same purchase.
@_date: 2017-08-14 19:33:46
THIS is why you don't listen to these morons. They're bashing Bitcoin with their mouths while at the same time building a position with their wallets.
If you're trying to build a major position in Bitcoin, the market is still small enough that you have to do it slowly. You don't put in $1 million order blocks at a time since that will rocket the price. You want to build your position at as low a price as possible.  So you bash it in public (you don't want to fuel the mania) while you buy it in private.
I guarantee Mark Cuban has a substantial holding.
@_date: 2017-08-06 00:33:05
I disagree.  I think most ppl who get into bitcoin over the next, say, 5 years will do so because of its long term potential as an investment, not because they want to buy stuff with it. Why would somebody go to the trouble of joining an exchange, sending in their identification info, waiting 5 days while their account gets verified, and purchasing BTC so that they can then turn around and buy a laptop with it, when they could just buy that laptop today using their credit card?
I mean, hey, maybe I'm wrong and ppl will do that. I'm open to the fact that I don't know everything.  I just dont see it. When I buy something, I don't give a shit if I pay using a centrally managed currency. It doesn't matter to me if the medium of exchange I use is revolutionary technology or not. I dont care if the currwncy i use has built in scarcity. I just want my goods or services.
As a long term investment though, these things matter. That's why I invest in bitcoin. I certainty don't buy BTC today so I can spend it tomorrow.

I believe part of bitcoins role in the global financial system will be as a safe haven, a place to put your money in times of heightened  geopolitical risk.
Ironically, the current NK crisis could very well be an excellent test case for BTC. Why? Because the primary safe havens today are gold and the Japanese Yen. In times of increased geopolitical risk, the Yen usually goes up, as it's currency is considered quite table, as well as being the least inflationary major currency on Earth. This has some flaws though, because the Yen is not REALLY outside the financial system, it is a part of it. Especially in this particular crisis where Japan is at the epicenter of it. It seems odd to put your money in the countries currency most at risk in the crisis.
To that effect, Bitcoin will be a superior choice, because it truly IS outside the existing system. If all your safe haven money is in the Yen, and then Japan gets nuked, that doesn't help you much does it? Bitcoins decentralized nature make it a fantastic safe haven, and the current crisis is uniquely suited to prove it.
@_date: 2017-08-12 20:18:04
how is it a problem exactly? Everyone is holding, ergo, demand to buy is outstripping available supply for sale. Thus, we have a powerful bull market.

A bubble has nothing to do with debt. A bubble is simply an asset inflated way beyond its intrinsic wealth. Debt itself can BE in a bubble, just like gold, stocks, tulips, or Bitcoin. 
But "debt" is not a prerequisite for a bubble.
To answer your question, Bitcoin is not in a bubble yet. There is almost no institutional money in it yet. No central banks. Most ppl still only have a vague understanding of what BTC is, and outside of reddit forums like this, the vast majority of ppl don't own any bitcoin yet.

Which is why BCH is in trouble. The readjustment period coming up in 2 days is going to be using the huge amount of hashpower it has right now for the next period. Which would be fine, except that as soon as that difficulty goes up 4x, the vast majority of that hashpower is going to leave.

@_date: 2017-08-26 12:26:48
Yep. It will also act as a safe haven for that reason; it exists and trades OUTSIDE the global financial system. In a way, it's like a life raft that any investor can park their money in the event of  geopolitical/economic turmoil. Current safe havens (Treasuries, Bunds, the Yen, gold etc) all exist WITHIN the system, and so you're never really completely protected from a major crisis.  Bitcoin, OTOH, will be a tranquil island investors can seek shelter on in times of trouble.

Governments can't shut it down. China tried it, and it didn't work.
At the end of the day, governments will (and already are) see the benefits of blockchain technology, and will likely regulate what they can, and end up promoting it. They won't be able to regulate what happens in the blockchain itself, but sooner or later, you're going to have to change that BTC into the local currency, and THAT'S the chokepoint that they'll regulate.
Frankly, for all the concern about tax evasion and money laundering, blockchain technology makes it much easier to detect and prevent such crimes. That's why governments will embrace it.

That's really the only thing we need to realize.
All these ppl who say they know for sure bitcoins role in the global financial system are fools. We all have our ideas, of course, but none of us know.
But we don't need to know. All we need to do at this point is ask ourselves : " Is there a use for frictionless, instantaneous global money transfers?"
If the answer is yes (which is clearly is) then you buy.
Capital behaves like electricity, or water: it will always take the path of least resistance available to it, and it will always seek to reduce friction. To that end, Bitcoin is so obviously an upgrade to existing capital infrastructure that it's widespread adoption is almost inevitable.
The worm is turning fast. While it seems like it's been a long time to legitimacy for most of us, for most regular ppl, it will seem like it happened overnight. And when that critical mass of ppl start to believe that Bitcoin has a major role to play in global finance , this thing is going to take off like a rocket.

Many of us don't believe Bitcoins future lies as a medium of exchange. I've long believed it will become an asset class, that every investment portfolio in the world will be advised to have some exposure too, to act as a store of value/inflation hedge.
In such a role, fees/tx times are far less relevent then things like market size, liquidity, and scarcity.
And in any case, once BCH becomes unprofitable to mine again (almost there, it looks like) the hashpower will come back. We've done this dance before.
And if you don't see value in BTC, the good news is, you're free to not put your money into it. Judging by the price action of the past few days, most p[eople see much more value in BTC then in BCH.

Moore's Law (doubling every 18 months) was intially used to describe transistor capacity, but other technologies have seemed to grow oddly in line wiht Moore's Law, from the Internet, to pixelsize in cameras.
Several academics have suggested Bitcoin price is (so far) following surprisingly accurate according to Moore's Law. Now, obviously, price cannot grow exponentially forever, but it could easily grow at Moore's Law during the adoption phase, which will probably take 10-20 years until the market matures.
So as a rough and dirty calculation, there would be some support if you wanted to use Moore's Law as a model for 10 years from now. That would give a price target of around $31,000 10 years from now.

Disagree. in stocks such as PayPal, a "share" simply means you own a share of that business. If a business has a market cap of $100 and you own 10% of the shares, that means your share (i.e. the part that you own) is worth $10.
Likewise, by owning Bitcoins, you could be said to own a proportional share of the Bitcoin's total value. 
It's not exactly an exact comparison, and Bitcoin is certainly different from PayPal (or any other corporation) in many practical ways. But from a purely economic perspective, it could be a similar comparison. As in, if you owned 10% of the outstanding bitcoins today, you'd have a stake roughly equivalent in value to if you owned 10% of Paypals shares.

This is silly. First of all, it seems unlikely that most transactions would be done in Bitcoin, even if a merchant accepted it. Secondly, a merchant would accept Bitcoin for the same reason why an investor would buy it: because they expect it to appreciate in value.
A better question is: why would consumers SPEND their Bitcoin (a deflationary currency that will be worth more in the future) when they have the option of spending in fiat, an inflationary currency which will be worth less in the future.
And for those taht say "well, just replenish your BTC purchases with fiat" that just doesn't seem like a good idea. First of all, it's a pain in the ass. But more importantly, how much in fees do you pay to transfer your fiat onto an exchange to purchase your coin with? likely around 5%. So by doing this, you're just placing a 5% tax on yourself for no reason.

as far as I understand, it's already split.
So let's say you have 2 BTC on a paper wallet with keys. You send that to a different wallet. You still have your BCH with the same wallet/same key remaining. Just wait until a reputable wallet supports BCH and send to that one using the same key

I'm confused. Do we know have BTC and BCC yet? Can we sell one or the other?
@_date: 2017-08-02 16:43:51
I'm in the process of writing an essay about exzactly this problem. Companies do stock splits (with a few notable exceptions such as Berkshire Hathaway) because there's a deep psycological block against buying such high priced assets. Obviously, Bitcoin can't do a stock split in the same way, but I think there's a better way to reduce the psycological block many ppl will have.
Namely, bitcoin should be priced in kilobits (1/1000 of a bitcoin). So the current price would be quoted as 2.71 kb. For those that are used to the current price scheme, it's easy enough to convert. Just remove the decimal and add a zero at the end. And it's just easier for our brains to process.
Let's say the price is $5687/BTC. If you're somebody trying to get into BTC for the first time, and you only have $1000 to spend, it will be much easier to understand (and more satisfying) to buy 176 kb then it would be to buy  0.175893 BTC. This issue will get worse and worse as the price goes up and up. 
If such a time comes that the price goes to $1 million/coin, you would switch to millibits (1/1,000,000 of a BTC). So you'd go from 999 kb to 1 mb.
Such a system provides easy scaling, and would encourage adoption of BTC in general.
This would also reduce a lot of the percieved risk of volatility (of course it would not affect ACTUAL volatility, but simply the perception of it). a 10% from 4.51 kb to 4.06 kb seems less painful then $4501 to $4006.
I don't think you'd need to change the code or anything to do with BTC itself. The exchanges would simply cahnge how they quote the prices.

Of course it doesn't.  The vast majority of new money buy, and hold. Nobody is sending large amounts of transactions frequently. 
In any case, the high fees are temporary, as the EDA continues to exert irresistible selling pressure on BCH. The hashpower will come back soon enough.

@_date: 2017-08-31 17:18:49
The problem lies with getting the cash there in the first place. Once you factor in all fees and conversions, you'll probably be paying quite a bit more then $4700/coin.
Eventually as the market mature, there will be  some large hedge fund that already has huge amounts of capital in each country, running a bot to instantly take advantage of the arb opportunities, buying in the low country, immediately withdrawing it to a higher trading exchange and selling it there.

A) they can't, or they would've done so when it was in its infancy. China tried a few months ago and it didn't work, so they relented. The decentralized nature of bitcoin means there's nothing to shut down
B) I don't think they'd want too. Contrary to what some say, blockchain technology actually makes it EASUER to detect and track money laundering, tax evasion and other financial crimes. Seems much more likely to me that you'll see governments put some modest regulations in and then actually PROMOTE bitcoin. 
This is already happening with tech savvy countries such as Japan and South Korea basically making bitcoin legal tender in recent months. Watch for other countries to follow soon.

In this case, what's more likely: that Satoshi is the kind of person that would have access to billions and choose not to touch a single dollar (which is basically no person ever)? Or that he died or lost his private keys, something that seems to be a much more common scenario?
We'd better hope he's dead or lost his keys or something. If even one of those BTC ever leave their wallets, BTC will have a bad day.

Yeah ppl who say "Bitcoin is for money laundering and criminals and thus the government will eventually crack down on it" are 100% wrong.

 GBTC is just a fund that buys bitcoins.
And the only reason they're putting such a crazy premium is because it's the only ETF in town. The premium on such a junky etf suggests extremely high demand from retail investors. 
The SEC halted that etf last week anyways, rumour has it in preparation for launching a proper ETF on the NASDAQ. If that got announced today, the price would go up $2000 in a day (or at least some similary absurd number)

Because its real value lies as a store if value/infkation hedge. It has value as a defense against the value loss if fiat currency, similar to gold.
Gold isn't a medium of exchange in any real sense. Nobody would argue it doesn't have value.
Why would I pay for my everyday purchases in a  currency that is deflationary (i.e. will be worth more in the future) when I can make the same purchase for the same price in a currency that is inflationary (I. E. Will be worth less in the future)? 
I wouldn't. 
Ask yourself, if you had $5000 in bitcoin and $5000 in cash right now and went to buy a car for $5000. The dealer accepts both currencies. Which would you use to pay for it? I don't know about you but I'd use my cash. That's the same calculation most consumers will make.

Ppl "hoarding " coins is probably the main reason for its stratospheric rise, will be the reason why we keep going up. When there aren't many sellers, it doesn't take much new buying to propel it forward.
And in the  long term, the best thing to encourage widespread adoption will be higher prices, period. New ATH's does more to convince those on the fence/new money to get in then anything else.
Once widespread adoption happens, THEN the different uses of bitcoin will become apparent and evolve organically. No matter what you think Bitcoin is/will be, NONE of it will come to pass until we get broad based acceptance of cryotocurrencies. 
Holding is the best thing for Bitcoin right now.

Not quite doubled. Price was around $2600 on the 1. So let's say you had 10 coins, your copins are worth $26,000
Since then, your BTC has gone up in value to $4022 (price right now) and your 10 BCH are now trading at $617.
So your investment is now worth (assuming you didn't touch them) $46,000, a 78% gain. Not bad for a few weeks.

Important step in order to promote wider adoption and legiotimacy, especially among the large institutional investors that are crucial to the long term appreciation of BTC.
With a robust options and future markets, instutional investors (who are very risk averse by nature) will be able to properly hedge their risks, thus encouragin many who would otherwise stay out of BTC due to risk/volatility.

Even if he has no interest in money, one would think he'd take SOME of it and give it to charity or something.

Look at the market caps of RC Cola and Coca Cola. Is Coke so much better then RC that it's worth hundreds of billions more? Of course not. Taste is subjective anyways.
There is a huge advantage to being the first on the block. Most people are just now becoming familiar with Bitcoin. The vast majority of ppl don't even know there ARE other coins, let alone name one. They certainly aren't going to the bulk of their money into them. We're now in the expansion phase of Bitcoin, where much of the growth will be powered by new money. The vast majority of new money coming in is going to go to Bitcoin, if only because most people don't know (and don't care enough to learn) about the specifics of a wave of other altcoins. 
Plus, Bitcoins had a huge head start, which gives it the lions share of venture capital and infrsatructure funding, which makes a more robust network.
Size tends to beget size. Bitcoin will benefit from a positive feedback loop, whereby most new money coming in will go to Bitcoin since it's the largest, most established cryptocurrency. And that new money will further increase the size of the network, which makes it even more attractive to the NEXT round of new money, and so on and so forth.
I think Bitcoins headstart is just too much to overcome. The most likely scenario, IMO, where another coin becomes the dominant coin is a major fuck up by Bitcoin itself, such as a major hack that makes Mt Gox look like childs play, or a game of brinksmanship among the devs/miners spins out of control or something. In other words, a self inflicted wound. Bitcoin has the crown right now, and I think it's Bitcoins to lose.

Of course it's speculative. That doesn't mean it's in a bubble. It probably WILL bubble someday, but when most people have barely heard of Bitcoin, and probably less then 2% of the population own Bitcoin, and with very low institutional dollars invested (yet), we're not even close to a bubble. When the dot com bubble burst, EVERYBODY was in the market getting rich (on paper). You'd have janitors buying second homes and cab drivers giving hot tips. When that happens, I'll be worried.
About your use case, it may have been INTENDED to be a currency used to buy goods and services, I just don't see that as likely. It's inherent deflationary nature suggests that people will always be loathe to actually spend it. Why purchase everyday goods and services in a deflationary currency that will be worth more in the future when you can buy it at the same price in an INflationary currency that will be worth less in the future? It just goes against everything we know about human economic behavior.
I think it is much better suited as an investment asset class, as you say. But that doesn't mean it's a ponzi scheme. Is gold a ponzi scheme? Are bonds? Is the USD or JPY? The fact is, the global financial system badly needs an instrument to function as both a store of value and inflation hedge. Probably 90% of golds value is because it serves that role (the other 10% being jewelry/industrial use). But gold is an imperfect player, Bitcoin is much better at playing those roles.
It seems likely that in the future, it will be best practices for every investment portfolio in the world to hold some exposure to BItcoin, whether it's 5% or 10% or whatg have you, that's going to mean a market cap of trillions of dollars and a coin price well into the 6 figures, perhaps even 7. That's the use case as I see it.

Someone can correct me if I'm wrong, but that's how nI understand it. So let's say you have 10 BTC in a paper wallet pre fork. The moment the fork occurs, BOTH chains have that same 10 coins in their blockchain, with the same address/key.
Post fork, however, the two chains cannot communicate with each other in any way. So let's say you now send your 10 BTC to a BTC wallet. That transaction will be updated on the BTC blockchain, but according to the BCH blockchain, you haven't done anything, so you should still have 10 BCH in that same wallet.
IoW, the fork itself was the splitting tool.
@_date: 2017-08-05 00:15:01
At the end of the day, the fork was exceedingly good for Bitcoin because it no matter what you think of BTC or BCH, the end result is that all pre fork holders were given value by the fork. Our holdings of both coins are worth more then they were before the fork. This shows that forks, rather then things to be feared due to uncertainty, are actually things to be excited about.
Each coin will go it's own separate way, and the market will sort out the winners and losers. In the meantime, all bitcoin holders are now richer.
This will go along way towards attracting new and skittish money, especially the large instutional money (money that is very skittish by nature) that BTC needs to power it through the next phase of its development.

"However since one of the main goals of btc is to become a functional alternative currency, I'm worried that most people will not want to spend their coins and this objective will never come to fruition"
This is why it seems quite likely Bitcoin will never be used in significant numbers as a medium of exchange to make everyday purposes. If that were my main reason for Bitcoin, I would sell now, because it seems extremely unlikely to happen. Bitcoin is inherently deflationary (by design). Over the long term (assuming widespread use becomes a permanent feature) it has no choice to go but up vs fiat currencies, due to limited supply, as well as lost coins.
On the other hand, these properties make it ideal as a store of value/inflation hedge, the way gold is used now. All the properties that make gold the best store of value we have (scarcity, hard to counterfeit etc) are fouind in Bitcoin, only bitcoin is superior. So it seems to me that Bitcoin will eventually be the prefereed vehicle to achieve these goals. I easily envision a future where it will be considered best practice for every investment portfolio in the world to have a set exposure to Bitcoin. THAT'S my value proposition, and that's why I see Bitcoin easily into the 6 figures in 5-10 years.
It will also have great value as a wealth transfer product, allowing large amounts of money to be transferd anywhere in the world, at low cost, instantly, using simple software anyone can download for free.
That's how I see it. The "Bitcoin as currency thing strikes me as a role it is quite ill suited for. Why would consumers buy goods in a deflationary currency that will be worth more in the future when they could buy the smae goods at the same price in an inflationary currency that will be worth less in the future? It defies everything we know about human economic behavior.
Trying to force BTC into a role of medium of exchange seems like trying to force a round peg in a square hole. Why not just embrace the use it is perfectly suited for?

Personally, I believe bitcoins true value and future lies much more as an asset class then as a currency to be spent. It'll be more like gold then local currency. 
It's deflationary nature will strongly discourage it's use as a currency, and it's properties as a store of value/inflation hedge make it a far more natural fit then as a traditional means of exchange.

I think Bitcoin is the rising tide that floats all boats. As Bitcoin goes, so too do the alts.
One trend I've noticed is that when Bitcoin is going down, the altcoins do as well, but less so. When it goes up, they also go up, just less so.
This suggests BTC is the leader, the rest follow. It also presents trading hedging opportunities.
When I feel BTC is high and due for a pullback, I'll usually buy ETH/BTC. When I feel it's low and due to rise, I'll short it. If BTC keeps going up, you'll lose a biut on your ETH/BTC short, but gain more in the overall value of your BTC. If BTC pulls back as expected, you'll get some profit from your ETH/BTC buy.

Some of it is bunk, and some of it actually works. 
Price is merely a distillation of everything that goes into pricing an asset in one easy number: fundamentals, sentiment, optimism, forcast, outlook, potential etc. All the things that move an asset are rolled into that one number: price. By studying it, you can get a pretty accurate sense of the asset.

I don't think buying gold is necessarily effective as a short on BTC.
In any case, you have't looked very hard. Most (all?) major crypto exchanges allow margin leveraged trading with 15% margin.
So you could short $100,000 worth of Bitcoin with $15,000 in your account (or any price using the same ratio).
Seems like a real easy way to get wiped out though.

Sure did. And what is the total it's fallen against those two currencies off the highs? 50%? Little more?
@_date: 2017-08-06 16:53:10
Well considering this fork added about 30% in value to pre fork holders in less then a week (when you add the price increase post fork with the value of free BCH), we should all hope there's another fork.
@_date: 2017-08-18 16:13:17
Exactly. The market will balance out. IF tons of miners switch to BCH, two things will happen: 1) less coins will be mined of BTC, reducing supply, and reducing selling pressure (miners create coins out of thin air, and then must sell on exchanges to make money) thus pushing up price, thus luring miners back to take advantage of increased profitability while at the same time 2) More coins mined on BCH will mean more coins come into existence, means more coins dumped on the market, means price will go down, thus harming the profitability calculation and luring miners back to BTC again.
BTC is a much larger market and thus can absorb much larger amounts of coin selling. If a significant amount of the mining power moved to BCH, the much smaller market would likely not be able to handle the increased selling volume without going down hard....which, of course, will once again tip[ the profitability equation back to BTC
And remember....mining is almost equally profitable now after a nearly 100% rise in price. As a seasoned trader, I'm EXTREMELY skeptical that ANY asset can go up that hard that fast and have those gains stick. 
At the end of the day, the markets will find an equilibrium that should be roughly commensurate with the sizes of each market. In other words, if BTC is, say, 60% bigger, it will likely grab about 60% more hashpower.
There may be ebbs and flows as the equilibirum settles in, but eventually it will settle in. 
I'm just really sckeptical that large amounts of miners will abandon the huge infrastructure BTC has. That can't just be built from scratch overnight.
@_date: 2017-08-31 23:26:01
It's not clear yet that there will be a hard fork.
But yes, if it happens, all holders will get both coins.
@_date: 2017-08-05 18:19:31
No doubt. The thing is though, very few experts ever actually proclaim themselves infallible.  It's the know nothings that assume experts THINK themselves infallible, and then when sometimes they get it wrong (which is inevitable) the know nothings can't wait to scream "see?!? What do experts know? These guys don't know any better then you or me!!"
Of course experts are wrong sometimes. They are human after all. But I'll put higher stock in the opinion  of somebody deeply versed in the nuance of a particular topic then some blowhard on the Internet any day. 
A total rejection of expertise on a grand scale leads to something like Brexit, which by all accounts is looking more and more like a nation crushing disaster for the UK every day.
@_date: 2017-08-12 21:36:24
What's the use case for gold? That it's a store of value. Bitcoin does that better. Usually, when a superior product enters the marketplace, the market will reward it with the lions share of market share.

@_date: 2017-08-26 21:29:48
It's only stable because the spread between cost of production and price is small right now. In a few hours when difficulty readjusts and then the EDA kicks in 12 hours later because all the hashpower has gone, the cost of production will go down dramatically, and it will be profitable to mine BCH even with a price of $300 or $400. So the hashpower will come back, mine a shit ton of coins, and dump them for BTC (which is clearly what they've been doing, considering BCH has been going steadily down against BTC for days) until the spread between cost of production and price is low again, and the cycle will continue again and again until they squeeze as much blood from this stone as they can get and then leave the corpse for BTC.

Irrelevant.  It's why comments about "Satoshis original vision" is so dumb.
Once a technology is released to the world, the creator no longer had the ability to shape the technology, the market/global community does that.
The Internet was created by the defense department primarily to send emails to each other. And look what it's become.
What Satoshi meant for Bitcoin to be is almost certainly going to be vastly different from what it actually becomes.
@_date: 2017-08-12 23:58:18
yeah but the proportions involved are identical. All that matters is % increase, not the nominal number.
An altcoin priced at $5 going up $0.50 is exactly the same as Bitcoin priced at $4000 going up $400.
In other words, it's just as "hard" for the altcoin to go up $0.50 as it is for BTC to go up $400 (in that scenario)
@_date: 2017-08-23 17:42:46

I would say it's almost certain that he's dead. Or never existed.
I saw a meme abkht btcoin about once that made me think. It was the Keanu Reeves "what if I told you" one, and it was like "Satoshi never existed and a supercomputer from the future (perhaps blockstream based) sent back the white paper as instructions so we would build itself. 
It was supposed to be funny and it actualky was cute, or whatever.  But then it got me thinking. Would that REALLY be so crazy? Certainly no crazier then the entire universe we see being created by an all powerful, all knowing God who personally knows each and every one of us and cares about who we have sex with and  cant stand abortion and cares if we "sin". A guy who is so all powerful he created everything we see.....but such an emotional lightweight that he loves us all, but yet he gets so furious when we don't love him back and tortures us for eternity.  All of a sudden, the idea of a supercomputer sending information back into time doesn't seem that crazy.
I mean, when we look at our reality, down to the fundamentals, our entire universe is simply algorithms. When we peek under the hood of reality, all we find at the most basic levels are mathematical algorithms.  Kinda like, ya know, what you'd find in a computer simulation.
I'm not saying I BELIEVE that. But I dont dismiss it automatically as horsehit. I would say its probably not LIKELY, but IMO there's a definite non zero chance that "Satoshi" never existed.
I mean.....come on. A mysterious white paper shows up on the Internet and nobody knows who wrote it? That leada to a technology that becomes a global pehnemoem with the potential to change the world? Who is now worth billions but is just so pure of heart that he can't even be bothered to touch it? Doesn't that sound kinda like.....a fucking movie? Real life doesn't act like that. There's a literary term for that "Deus Ex Machina". It's when something happens that solves a seemingly impossible problem in a story that comes from a completely unexpected place and is often so unbelievable or unlikely that it can disrupt the audiences suspension of belief (the hero is in a perfect trap, with no way to get out and no options. HOW DOES HE GET OUT?!?! IS THIS IT?!?! .... Oh, it's a group of aliens who come to Earth to meet him. They saved him. Oh didn't you know? THere's aliens in this universe.  And they go around saving ppl).
Bitcoin is a a fucking Deus Ex Machina.  It's so unlikely that it is disrupting my suspension of disbelief.
@_date: 2017-08-05 00:27:04
No, it doesn't.  Why listen to a guy on YouTube when you can look at a real world example? Japan's Lost Decade shows what happens when a currency becomes deflationary. And BTC will be far more deflationary then the Yen ever was. 
Trying to force BTC into the role of medium of exchange is trying to force a square peg in a round hole. Why try to get it play a role it's not good at when it has a role to play that it is far, far better suited for?
BTC is a better store of value then gold, a better inflation hedge then gold, and will also act as a safe haven during times of increased geopolitical risk, in much the same way Gold and the Yen does today. 
If this comes to pass, BTC will be worth hundreds of thousands per coin. So that's a pretty sweet silver lining.
@_date: 2017-08-04 03:13:31
I actually don't see BTC as money used in commerce, partly for that reason.

Yes of course they do. But they aren't buying consumer goods with their stocks. 
The point is, most bitcoin users will allocate a certain percentage of their income to bitcoin, and then keep it there. They'll use the rest to pay for consumer goods. They aren't going to buy a computer, or a stick of gum, or lunch, with their bitcoin. That's what fiat currency is for. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 03:44:49
At this point, an act of God.
Imagine a 100 m dash that you only start when the other guy is at the 50 m line. It's POSSIBLE to overtake him, in theory. But in practice, his head start makes it almost impossible. 
Bitcoin may not be the best technology of the Cryptos. But it's First On The Block status gave it an advantage that is likely to be impossible to overcome.
Understand, the quirky little community that Bitcoin has been until now is just about done. 99.9% of all the new money coming in couldn't give a rats ass about "Satoshis Vision" or "anarcho-capitalism ". They'll have no idea what "Hodling" is. They'll invest for one reason only: because they want to get rich.
And then the institutional money and central banks will come in and buy most of the coins and do nothing  but put them on the balance sheet. All of these groups care only about which coin is the dominant one.  And that's Bitcoin. It becomes a reinforcing feedback loop. IoW, all these new buyers will buy Bitcoin because it's the primary coin. Which in turn makes it even more dominant. Which in turn means more money will flow into it etc etc.
Butcoin is going to become a major pillar in the global financial system. It won't replace it.
@_date: 2017-08-31 15:26:59
I've got a working theory that we won't see that kind of pullback for a while. Bitcoins huge dips in the past were largely because the market was quite small and not very liquid. There seems to be a quickening of outside money flowing into it, and I have a hunch that institutional dollars (hedge funds, private wealth funds etc) is starting to buy in. These guys don't just hit the buy button. When you're placing an order for millions or billions, you have a team of traders that might take weeks or months to build up your position, so that you don't shoot the price to the moon. You want to get in for as low a dollar/cost average as possible.
It seems all the big dips are getting bought up ferociously.
@_date: 2017-08-05 14:48:14

No. First of all, ask 10 random ppl if they've heard of bitcoin, and if they own any. You'll probably get something like 6 or 7 will have vaguely heard about it. If you're lucky, maybe 1 will own some, but likely none.
When the dot com bubble burst, you couldn't run into a janitor, delivery man, or gardner who had some hot tip to share. Literally EVERYbody was in on it. That's the key.
When you start getting hot tips from your neighbour about crypto, then maybe.
Make no mistake, there eventually WILL be a bubble, but we're nowhere near the saturation point needed for it yet. That's likely years away.
We don't have hardly any large, institutional money in yet. No central banks.
It's still a weird niche hobby project, according to most ppl.
And even when that future bubble pops, all it will do is shake out the speculators and weak hands until price slowly rises again, because the underlying blockchain technology has such obvious utility and value to the modern global finance system.
@_date: 2017-08-05 00:37:29
Almost the entirety of bitcoins appreciation right now is due to new money coming in, and this will be the case for some time. But even when the market matures, Bitcoin will always be heavily deflationary (and thus consumers will have a strong disincentive not to spend it). Obviously this is due to the hard cap on coins, but also the fact that coins will continuously being removed from the float due to ppl losing their key, or dying without giving their keys to a 3rd party etc
@_date: 2017-08-28 19:40:03
I would strongly disagree. Bitcoins value is as a brand new asset class, used as a store of value/inflation hedge. Every investment portfolio in the world will be advised to hold some allotment in Bitcoin. Bitcoin isn't going to destroy the global financial system, it will be absorbed into it.
Not everybody shares your anarcho-capitalist vision of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-10 19:56:48

As well, one would imagine the loss of hash power would reduce supply, and therefore raise bitcoin price....which would make BTC even more profitable  which would attract hash power back.

Well, so far price seems to loosely correlated with Moores Law (doubling every 18 months). It was originally applied to computing, but it seems to be accurate for many major technologies, such as pixels per dollar on cameras, or The Internet. Why woukdnt another equally disruptive technology like Bitcoin follow the same pattern?
That would equal out to about 5.5%/mo, so going by that loose math, I'll give it a price target of around $4200
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:58:48
This is how I understand it as well.
Since we can't yet move BCH safely (until a reputable exchange/wallet updates it's software, which hopefuylly should be anytime now) it's best to move your BTC first, since giving your BCH key to an untested 3rd party would also give them access to your BTC, a risk most of us probalby wouldn't take. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 18:12:13
And that's the sam boat everyone (who isn't already set up with money deposited) is in. If you decided last MOnday that after the uncertainty with the fork and Bitcoin breaking the (then) high of $3000, it's a good time to get in, you MIGHT be just buying your BTC today (assuming your exchange was quick). 
Then there's going to be ppl deciding to buy today. NYT has it on page 1 of the financial section. CNBC is all over it. THat's the kind of stuff that gets people in. If ppl decide today to get in, we MIGHT see their money next week.
My point is, this thing could easily get to $5000 or $6000 within the next few weeks before we have a correction.
@_date: 2017-08-29 22:38:38
Yes, my nature, your nature, probably Satoshis nature.  Pretty much everything we know about human economic behavior since we started thinking about such things suggests that humans tend to seek out and collect resources.  Theres nothing bad or wvil or greedy about this. Its just how weve evolved. The same holds true for almost every animal in the animal Kingdom too. while some exceptions exist, the fact that that holds true for pretty much the entirety of the human race me and that it PROBABLY holds true for Satoshi as well.
Not for certain, of course, but pretty close to it.

Go ask 10 random ppl how many have invested in bitcoin. You'd be lucky to find one. There's absolutely zero institutional money in bitcoin yet. No central banks are holding.  There's no major bitcoin etf's (yet). 
When taxi drivers are giving you crypto tips and janitors are becoming millionaires, then yes, maybe.
As for what the charts look like, go back and zoom in on some spikes back when the price was in mid hundreds. You'll see a chart that looks identical to what it looks like now.

Elliot wave is mostly bunk that relies on confirmation bias. It's not predictive at all. If you think you see that 5th wave and sell, and you're right, you think "wave theory was right!". But if you were wrong it's "must've read the chart wrong and that wasn't a wave at all".

@_date: 2017-08-02 14:13:37
I don't see any reason to sell at all.
Let's say BCH collapses over the next week. What should happen is that the "value" that was over on the BCH fork comes back over to the BTC fork. So you're not "losing" value by not selling your BCH because if it collapses, you'll see it on BTC.
OTOH, if BCH actually has value in and of itself and carves out a niche, then it will have been a good idea to hold onto your BCH.
Dumping BCH now seems like a high risk/low reward move, because frankly, anybody who says they know for sure what will happen with these two coins in the coming months is either a fool or a liar.

No. Gold's only value is that you know other ppl also value it. It has no purely utilitarian value. You can't eat it. It doesn't provide shelter.
If, for some reason, everyone in the world just stopped accepting it as an item of value, it would be worthless. But once an item has been deemed by people to have value, it generally keeps it's value (barring some outside interference, such as uncontrolled fiat money printing), People won't stop valuing gold, and they won't stop valuing Bitcoin.

From an other article a few weeks ago:
" Dalia Blass, whose firm advised the Winklevoss twins on their most recent bid for SEC approval, “is said to be in line to take over, according to a person familiar with the matter,”
So the person who advised the WV twins on their EFT bid? Combined with the SEC halting the junky, overpriced Bitcoin etf that traded on the pink sheets? You're right, there's something big here.
If an ETF was announced tomorrow, price would shoot up to $7000 immediately (although it may drift down from there until the ETF actually starts trading)

Pyramid schemes refer to something without underlying value.
Bitcoin is a way to transfer as much wealth as you wish, instantaneously, at a fraction of the cost of existing wealth transfers, using only software.

Bitcoin willl always be Bitcoin.
If they fork off an altcoin (like BCH) and it gets more PoW, then it will become the dominant coin. But it will still be called whatever it's called. If Bitcoin Cash becomes the dominant coin, it will still be Bitcoin Cash.
@_date: 2017-08-21 21:19:05
It isn't active. Won't be until Tuesday.
Transactions are slow right now because a lot of hashpower got redire3cted to BCH to take advatnage of the brief spike in profitability.
In 2 days, BCH difficulty goes up 340%, and in 3 days BTC's drops about 6%. That will significantly change the profitability back to BTC and all the hashpower that went there will come back here.

Prediction: BCC never mines a block.
The longer this goes on without a block, the longer those mining BCC will say "well, this is some bullshit. We could've made XX amount of BTC by now" and start redirecting hashpower back to BTC. Once that starts happening, even the BCC true believers will stop mining. Sure, they may believe in the big block, but that's not going to help much if there's not enough hashpower to mine it.

Kraken has traded on $26 million in total. That's a tiny drop in the bucket. It's impossible to have anyt sort of price discovery with such tiny percentage of total market cap trading.

And my guess is the vast majority of the money goes back into BTC.

People who say there isn't anything underlying Bitcoin are missing the point entirely. Bitcoin IS itself the value proposition. Perhaps it's easier to think of Bitcoin as a product rather then a currency.
Imagine a product that allows you to be able to send wealth, anywhere in the world, almost instantaneously, for a fraction of a cost of the current system (Bank wires/transfers). Would you say this product has value to the global finance system? The answer, of course, is "yes, huge value" .That's what Bitcoin is. It's wealth transferring software that answers probably the oldest problem in economics: namely, how do I know that my counterparty is trustworthy?
Up until now, the answer to that has been: Banks. Banks removed the need to trust your counterparty. So long as you trusted the bank, you didn't need to trust your counterparty. Of course, banks have to make their money and so they will add fees and costs to any transactions they do for you.
Bitcoin is the next evolution in this sytem. It removes the friction of global wealth transfers, removes the middleman (the bank), and therefore offers greatly reduced fees.
THAT'S where the value is. Bitcoin doesn't need to have value "underneath it" because Bitcoin itself IS the value.
@_date: 2017-08-09 20:13:49
I think it will be incredibly useful as a new asset class. It will be standard portfolio best practice for every investment portfolio to have a certain exposure to the Crypto  asset class (maybe 10%). All major central banks will hold billions on their balance sheet.
That's likely why it seems the consumer use (namely, purchasing goods and services with bitcoin) is dwindling: the market is realizing that isn't the destiny of bitcoin. 
I keep saying this here, but it just doesn't stand up to scrutiny to expect consumers will purchase goods with a deflationary currency that will be worth more tomorrow when they could just as easily purchase the same goods for the same price in an inflationary currency that will be worth less tomorrow.
@_date: 2017-08-29 01:03:44
And what mechanism could that actually happen? If you think it can, I don't think you understand Bitcoin. It cannot BE centralized.
That's the entire point of it.
Oh, let me guess.  Someone in Twitter or reddit told.you that Big Blocks are the protection against this dreaded "centralization "? 
Dude they told you that so they'd have a market to dump their shit coin into. BCH is a textbook pump n dump. They couldn't have done it without "true believers " like yourself. 
Don't you think it's odd how Jihan have an interview yesterday praising Bitcoin (specifically did NOT  Bitcoin Cash) and saying it was going to $10k? They're playing you all for fools, and taking advantage of your lack of technical knowhow to do it.

Bit the speculation isn't happening in a vacuum.  It's happening because the value of Bitcoin as a brand new asset class is becoming more and more understood.
That said, a huge part of the volatility is because the market is still in its infancy and has a fraction of the volume it will in the future. As the market matures, the added volume will greatly lower the volatility.
It's no coincidence that the most heavily traded market (Fx) is also, by far, the least volatile. Volatility tends to move inversely of volume.
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:21:22
Not me. I don't have an ideology one way or the other. I don't care HOW it gets widespread adoption, I just care that it DOES. And after studying the strengths and weaknesses I think it's a far more natural fit as a new asset class then it does as a medium of exchange. 
I mean, honestly I couldn't care less one way or the other. If it goes to $100,000+ coin because it's widespread use as a MoE, I'm cool with that. I just dont think it's properties make that likely.
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:30:17
meh. They're dumping their BCH and immediately buying BTC. Why do you think BCH has gone down steadily and consistently against BTC since this hashpower shenanigans started? This is the reason why we're scraping ATH's again.
Once the miners get as much blood from the stone that is BCH, they'll leave the corpse to be picked over by daytraders and come back to BTC full time. BCH was created solely as a vehicle to enrich miners.

Yes, that's the problem...the difficulty will have to drop way more then the previous time, each time. And it will do it fast enough that price will have no chance to recover, which means a neverending cascade of sell pressure.
Now that BTC is more profitable, it enters stage 3, which is when all the hashpower goes back to BTC, slowing BCH to a crawl. So much that within 36 hours, the EDA will have to kick in enough times to make BCH more profitable again, even at the much lower price. That will start another cycle back at stage 1, where a ton of hashpower comes BACK to BCH, mines a shit ton of coins, dumps those coins at any price (because it doesn't matter the price, so long as it's more profitable then BTC) and it goes like that, again and again, until BCH is at $100 or some other miniscule price.
@_date: 2017-08-22 19:38:34
"In order for bitcoin to become more popular, it must be used as currency"
says who? For me p[ersonally, I don't think it'll ever be used as a currency in any significant numbers, but rather a new asset class that every investment portfolio in the world will have a certain allocation of, to be used as a store of value/inflation hedge. It seems particularly ill suited to be used as a consumer currency, due to it's inherent deflationary nature.
As for hodling, hodling pushed up the price, and the price constantly going up does WAY more for encouraging usage and popularity then how many transactions/day there are.
@_date: 2017-08-26 21:14:58
Usually something like that is a fat finger. Added an extra zero or something. Or sometimes they get a margin call for other investments and the algoritm sells all their positions at market which can tank if there's not a lot of depth. Doesn't mean anything, especially since price went up right after.
That's why I often will have limit buy orders well under price at all times. I don't trade on Kraken so didn't get in on this one, but almost always when something like this happens, price rebounds almost immediately, resulting in instant profits.

In all honesty, would you have really kept it until now? If you put in $100 and it went up to $200, most ppl would have sold. Unless you really, truly understand the technology and believed in it. But if you did that, you would've just bought it back then.

"It's deflationary," said Rodney Garratt, an economist with the University of California who has studied the Bitcoin marketplace. "Eventually the stock of bitcoin would be exhausted, and as the economy grows there's more stuff. [So] prices have to fall, you can't control that."
"The Federal Reserve was in part founded on the principle of elastic currency supply, the idea being that you can mitigate some of the ill effects of economic downturns and temper the effects of big economic upturns by adjusting the money supply," he added. "It's a tool to help make the economy run better on average, and the idea of having a fixed money supply takes that all away."
HE must not be a very good economist. This sort of logic assumes that there's a bottom floor to how many times bitcoin can be divided. Of course, there isn't, and Bitcoin could be divided into as many decimal places as one would want too, which allows for the kind of "adjusting money supply" this clown is talking about, only the adjustment will happen organically, without any decisions by a central authority needed, and in real time.

No worries, we all have to learn somewhere.
It seems likely Bitcoin WILL be in a bubble someday, but that day is long off. Remember, too, that "bubble" refers to value and not price. There are plenty of scenarios where Bitcoin could truly BE worth hundreds of thousands of dollars per coin. In that scenario, since the underlying value is there, it would not be in a bubble if the price matched the value

Why would Kraken have your BCH? You sent them your BTC. Post split, the BTC is totally seperate from the BCH. After you sent your BTC, your BCH is still left behind in the wallet. They are no longer linked and sending your BTC would not ccause the BCH to tag along. You will need to send to a BCH supported wallet, from the same address using the same key.
A regular wallet balance check will show nothing because that is a wallet check for BTC (which you have moved out) not BCH.

There would be a supply/demand dynamic.  It's like when the price of oil goes down, some oil companies go bankrupt, and no major capital investments get made to pump new oil. This decreases the supply of oil and causes the price to raise.
Miners leaving to mine something would decrease the supply of coins entering the system. This would increase price, making bitcoin more profitable to mine, and the miners would come back.

No medium of exchange is ever "backed" by anything. Clearly fiat isn't, and it clearly has value (anybody who says it doesn't, ask them to burn a $100 bill. They shouldn't have any problem doing this since it has no value right?). Even when currency was on the gold standard, ok, currency was backed by gold. But what's gold backed by? Gold has been given value by humans for so long that we tend to think it has INHERENT value, which is doesn't. It's simply a metal, no more no less. You can't eat it. It doesn't provide shelter. It's true inherent value is whatever it's worth as an industrial metal.\
We decided a long time ago that gold would have value, and therefore, it has value. If we collectively decided, for some reason, that gold no longer had value, it wouldn't, despite being the exact same material.

That's fair enough. For me (and, i suspect, many other bitcoin users) I have no emotional involvement to it. I don't romanticize it. It's an investment, pure and simple.  I love the technology.  I believe it's the future. But it's a financial relationship for me, not an emotional one.
My point is, you don't get to decide what bitcoin means for anyone other then yourself. You only get to decide what bitcoin "means" for you and the bitcoins you own. Every other bitcoin owner gets to make their bitcoin "mean" whatever they want it to mean. 
My guess is the ideologues are going to be mighty disappointed in what bitcoin ends up being.  It isn't going to supplant the global financial system. I believe it's going to be absorbed into it, and become a part of it.

@_date: 2017-08-22 20:18:39
lol. Of course they will.
It's not like the miners jumped over there because they just believe soi much in BCH. If that was the case, they would've mined it from the begininng. They ONLY started mining it when the price went through the roof.
If these miners were so quick to jump over because it was more profitable, we would expect them to do the same when the other chain is profitable (like it is now).
Frankly, I think it's no coincidence that the price shot up at the exact same moment the difficulty readjusted. That was clearly a pump n dump (as evidenced by the dumping going on now), and it was probably a desperate attempt to induce the very death spiral that the paper talks about. They assumed all miners would jump over and mine, leaving BTC without enough hashpower to mine to the next difficulty readjustment period.
Clearly, it didn't work.

For me persaonlly, I don't give a shit about any of this.
I believe that Bitcoin (or a crypto like it) wil be a revolutionary technology and that's why I'm invested. I couldn't care less about block size or segwit or Satoshis vision. I believe when it all settles down, the market will have one clearly dominant coin, with al the altcoins serving specific niches. Right now, Bitcoin is undoubtedly the preferred coin, and I  think it will stay that way.
But if it became obvious that another coin was the markets preferred dominant coin, I'd switch to that.
I never understood the emotional connection many ppl here have with their personal favorite coins. Cryptos are a tool, nothing more or less. A fantastic, revolutionary tool, but just a tool.

Poor analogy, because you would've had no way of knowing which stock was going to go up more. It was an educated guess and you were either wrong or right.
Mining profitability, on the other hand, requires no such guesswork. All the relative factors (price of coin/difficulty) are well known in advance, therefore, should you choose to mine on the less profitable chain, you are indeed willingly taking a loss. There may be good reasons to take such a loss, but you are without doubt operating at a loss.
Any income you could have earned that you chose not too is a loss by any real world definition.

If significant amounts of hashpower leave, fees will go up (not great, but good in that it would change the profitiability calculation, thus luring miners back to BTC) and less coins will enter the supply, thus reducing selling pressure, thus raising prices, which will, again, change the profitability calculation.
Yes, transactions may be slower, but I don't personally think that mattersd that much. Unlike many, I think Bitcoins future is as a new asset class, not as a medium of exchange. As such, transaction times don't matter as much.
Almost everybody I know of that buys Bitcoin holds onto it. Doesn't much matter to them  if it takes 45 minutes to get 3 confirmations.

yes, it happened. It certainly was not ENCOURAGED by the Obama admin the way it is by the Trump admin. That's a huge difference.
Correlation is not causation, and the problem only became clear in the past few years. Tehre is a huge amount of inertia b uilt into the political system (some would argue that's a good thing). Changes to these sorts of things are measured in years, not months.
@_date: 2017-08-01 21:53:43
I don't think it's that crazy. I think there's probably a 25% chance (or so) that bitcoin carves out a niche as a global asset class, exhibiting properties of difference classes. 
I think it will act as a store of value (a role currently occupied by gold) as well as a safe haven (role currently shared between gold, some bonds, and some currencies, such as USD and JPY). 
I also think it will be held by all major central banks as part of their foreign reserves
In such a scenario, I think it's reasonable to assume that bitcoin could cannibalize at least 10% of golds market cap, as well as 5% of the worlds foreign reserves. 10% of golds market cap would be about $800 billion, while 5% of global foreign reserves is about $500 billion.
A $1.3 trillion market cap divided by 21 million coins would be around $61,000/BTC. That's probably where I would think is realistic on the upper limit, and yeah, that's pretty far from McAfee's estimate, but there's a few variables that could make his prediction come to pass, namely the real possibility that BTC takes a much larger share of golds market cap, like 50% or more. Considering bitcoin is superior to gold in every way from a store of value standpoint(can't be destroyed, much lighter/more portable, completely deflationary, real time inventory, much more divisible etc) standpoint.
As well, people are going to die and lock their bitcoins forever, or lose their private keys as time goes by. It's almost a guarantee that millions of bitcoins will be locked into the system, inaccessible to anyone. When trying to determine price/per BTC, we would have to calculate it as if these coins simply didn't exist. IoW, in a hypothetical scenario where, say, 3 million coins were lost forever, any price/coin calculation would be Total Market Cap/18 million, not TMC/21 million.
All in all, no, I don't think BTC will be $500,000 anytime soon, or ever. The number I'm expecting is, realistically, probably in the $10,000 range within 5 years or so. But there is at least a PATH to such a high number, even if you'd be a fool to EXPECT it.

Seems likely that if an account isn't touched for, say, 5 years, it would be safe to consider that lost. Some would not be truly lost but instead just owned by a saver of course. But it seems the vast majority of addresses with untouched funds for such a long period of time is because the owner no longer has acess

New money is what's currently pushing this thing over the top right now. 
Look, as more and more people come in, the share of people who truly understand Bitcoin as a % of the total market is going to get smaller and smaller. Within a few years, they'll be a small minority. The average investor/speculator is just coming to grips with Bitcoin. They don't want to hear about Doge and Dash and Lite and NEO.
I'm not saying those aren't solid coins. In fact, many are technologically superior. But Bitcoin has a massive TOMA (Top Of Mind Advantage) that is going to propel it higher in price.
You can be "right" on which coin is technologically superior and still miss out on a shit ton of gain. You can't fight the market.

Ideals can't pay the bills. In any case, thats bullshit. They mined BCH  at a losa because they believed they could recoup their losses later. They didn't do it out of the goodness of their heart.   If you really think these miners who spent millions of dollars on their equipment are going to indefinitely mine BCH at a loss with no hope of recouping that money because of "ideals" you're nuts.

Yup. If you decided after last weekend when the fork went well and it broke the previous high of $3000 over the weekend, you MIGHT just be getting your money into the Bitcoin ecosystem now, depending on how fast your exchange got through it's backlog.
The people who are deciding to get in today because of new ATH's every day and extremely favorable MSM coverage, we won't see their money coming in for at least another week or two.
In a way, this  chokepoint should smooth the ride up a little bit. It gives us the slow, steady melt up we're seeing now, rather then =/-20% days. I prefer it this way.

It's also possible he prevented the second Great Depression. That's exactly what caused the first one: after the crash of 29, the Fed panicked and introduced austerity and fiscal tightening. Bernanke was a student of the Great Depression and he felt that they did the exact wrong thing, that they should have RELAXED fiscal policy. That's what he did. And he likely prevented a second one.
Of course the flood of liquidity created asset bubbles, which they will deflate quickly soon as they tighten rates (something that should, btw, be great for BTC). But most would consider that a fair trade off.

If someone asks my advice, I'll give it, but at the end of the day, I could not care less if someone takes it, if they become millionaires or if they lose their shirt. And I'm not stupid enough to think that any postings me (or anyone else) makes on Reddit could possibly influence a $50 billion market.
That said, if you think an asset that's a few % points off it's all time highs and is up 300%+ on a YoY basis is a "downtrend" my advice for you would be to lend your money to somebody who knows what the fuck they're doing, because you obviously don't.

Exactly. The absurd premium that junky etf has shows there's massive interest in a Bitcoin ETF for the masses (which, IMO, would propel the price easily to $10,000 once it started trading).
Just put the proper safeguards in place and give the people what they want.
@_date: 2017-08-03 15:59:55
That will be one potential driver. Another one would be SEC greenlighting a bitcoin ETF. Another would be a strongly inflationary environment in the USD (which I think will happen once they start mopping up all the liquidity from QE. QE itself ended up being strongly deflationary. Therefore, it stands to reason that undoing it will be inflationary). Another would be major institutional money (hedge funds, central banks, pension funds etc) buying in. Another would be bitcoin grabbing significant market share of the remittance industry.
There's lots of potential sparkplugs.
@_date: 2017-08-04 20:37:51
Frankly, anybody who thinks they know for sure which chain will succeed is a fool.
We all have our opinions. I believe BTC will remain the primary coin. But the market will be the ultimate arbiter, and nothing you or I is going to change what the market decides.
To that end, the most prudent course of action is to hold both coins, and hope for the success of both.  It seems more and more likely that BCH will have value, even if as a secondary altcoin. Both will almost certainly be worth more in the future then they are today. BCH isn't going to zero anymore then ETC went to zero.
@_date: 2017-08-02 17:46:14
That is true, it just seems like you're picking up pennies in front of a steamroller. Of course if you're nimble enough, you can make some profits. But it seems like the juice isn't worth the squeeze.
There IS a chance (small, but definitely not zero) that the market prefers BCH and it becomes the dominant coin on the bitcoin blockchain, and with it, the title "Bitcoin". 
I'm ok with just holding both. I may not have AS MUCH profit, but I won't lose anything. 
How painful would it be to dump your BCH and convert it into 10% more BTC only to see BCH outperform BTC in the coming months/years?
@_date: 2017-08-24 19:12:31
my bad, misunderstood lol
@_date: 2017-08-24 23:00:09
You're almost never going to know the real "reason" for these sorts of things. All the positive MSM coverage, plus ATH hit just a week ago mean steady, sustained money will be flowing into BTC.
Remember, from the day you decide to invest (for most ppl who decide today, it's probably from reading a bullish report and saying "ya know, I've heard about Bitcoin for a while now. Maybe the time to invest is now") it probably takes about a week after you're set up and transfer your money until you buy (at the least). So there's a natural lag. If we hit an ATH today, the bullish coverage tomorrow will probably mean large inflows 2 weeks from now.
There is almost certainly hedge funds and institutional money trying to get in. When guys like this buy, they don't just hit the "buy" button. Theyt have traders who might spend weeks or months entering a position, because they deal in such huge size, they can't do it all at once or they explode the price. Did you notice how all the huge dips are getting bought aggresively? That's a sign that accumulation by some big money investors is happening.
@_date: 2017-08-19 03:09:59
How about: lend 1 BTC, pay back 1BTC + agreed upon interest rate? (Interest also pay a letter in BTC)
Then none of the deflationary stuff matters, because you're getting your BTC back.
@_date: 2017-08-06 00:20:27
I don't get the weird emotional connection ppl here have to it. Bitcoin is a tool. It's an amazing tool, and a game changing technology, but it's still just a tool.  We don't forge emotional connections with a hammer and then get furious if somebody else uses that hammer in a way we disagree with. We don't flip out and say "THAT ISN'T THE VISION THAT THE INVENTOR OF THE HAMMER HAD!!"
Nobody, not even Satoshi, has ownership of bitcoin. The only owners of Bitcoin are the aggregate owners of the bitcoins. Once the blockchain was invented and sent other into the world, the market became the ultimate decider of what bitcoin will or won't be. And it seems unlikely (for all the reasons I laid out above) that Bitcoin will ever be a medium of exchange the way that some ppl think it will. But even if it does, I'm not going to whine and pout about it. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 17:46:04
Seems like it's going to strengthen and legitimize BTC more then anything, especially if BCC is DoA right out of the gate.
@_date: 2017-08-30 19:57:58
Incidentally, the deflationary nature of Bitcoin will never go away. It's built into the system. Because of that, I personally don't see Bitcoin as a viable medium of exchange that will be used for everyday purchases. Ppl don't spend deflationary currencies (just ask the Japanese during the Lost Decade) we know this already. And there's never been a currency as deflationary as Bitcoin. Trying to force Bitcoin to be a medium of exchange is trying to ft a square peg in a round hole. It's poorly suited for it.
So I don't see increasing transaction numbers as all that critical to bitcoins long term potential. I see it as a new asset class, used as an inflation hedge/store of value, as well as a safe haven during geopolitical turmoil.as opposed to a medium of exchange, Bitcoin is perfectly suited for these roles, far superior to what is used for these jobs today (gold, the USD, the Yen, and sovereign debt). I envision it being best practices for every investment portfolio in the world to hold some set percentage of Bitcoin, say 10-15%. Should this come to pass, Bitcoins market cap will be in the tens of trillions and coins will be well into the 6 figures, perhaps into the 7's. 
And I know this will be anathema to all the anarcho-capitalists here, but I think the biggest holders of Bitcoin will be central banks. Note, that doesn't mean they'll control. It cannot be controlled. It's just that as it's importance to the global financial system becomes known, central banks will want to hold Bitcoin to provide stability and value to their national currencies. The biggest holders of gold today are central banks, and I don't think it can be reasonably said that central banks "control" gold.
@_date: 2017-08-25 02:56:44
So that one does. But there's lots more then this guy mining the frenzy periods. The majority of those coins are going to miners who could care less about BCH, and will just mine the most profitable chain. These guys have to pay for their electricity, equipment, employees etc. They have real world costs, they can't hold their coins. They're going to sell them, because they're a business and mining/selling coins is their primary business model.
@_date: 2017-08-28 19:43:12
Um, yeah. Where you been the past week? Are you not aware of the hashrate oscillations going on between BTC and BCH?

I think it's inherently deflationary. The volatility will definitely come down as the market matures, but the value of BTC relative to fiat currencies should permanently creep up. Frankly, that's one of the main selling points for me.
I have no interest in BTC as money to purchase things, and it's poorly suited for that. I'm not sure why ppl are so obsessed with getting ppl to use it as money. That's trying to force a square peg intonation round hole. Why not just let it develop organically into the role it's much better suited for: as a store of value/inflation hedge. Every investment portfolio in the world will have a certain allocation dedicated to BTC and other Cryptos. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 20:51:58

I'm reminded of an anecdote from Warren Buffet's biography. He talked about buying Coca Cola in (I think) the 80's, and how everybody said it was safe but clearly too mature for any major gains. He talked about reading an article in the WSJ that went something like "Everybody who looks at the history of Coca Cola looks at the price gains of the past few years, and decides that while it would've been a great investment back then, all the upside is gone". The article was from the 1920's.
And of course, Buffet himself has made tens of billions on his investment despite it being "too late" to buy CC then. And if you bought in the 20's "Despite it being "too late" then too you'd be looking at generational wealth today.
Bitcoin will be like that. People looked at it at $600 and thought "man, wish I'd gotten in a year ago, but all the upsides gone now" and never buy. People today look at it and say "man I wish I'd gotten in in January, but the upsides all gone now"
10 years from now, people will be looking at it at and say "man, I wish I'd gotten in at $50,000, but all the upsides gone now" and 50 years from now, someone will say "if only I could get in at $1 million, I'd buy, but look like all the upsides gone"
It's just how our brains work. This thing is still in it's infancy. Like, it just came out of the vagina 20 minutes ago. Wait until it's at least fully grown before you worry about all the upside being gone.

The consumer always has a choice and they always have the power, should they choose to use it.

Nothing other then consumer goods has TRUE intrinsic value. Even golds intrinsic value is simply it's worth as an industrial metal (which probably accounts for only a fraction of its price). You can't eat gold. You cant wear it to protect you from the elements. It won't provide shelter for you.
It has value only because everybody has confidence that future counterparties will consider it valuable. 
A good way to call bullshit on the "that has no value!!" crowd is give them some of it and then ask them to destroy it. If somebody says fiat currency is worthless, give them a $20 and ask them to destroy it. There's your answer.

Because in order to confirm, mathematical equations need to be done, which requires computing power.

@_date: 2017-08-02 15:48:57
It can't.
Until there is full price discovery, the BCH price is a mirage. I think it will have value, but whether that value is $1000 or $100 can't be properly determined until ppl can buy or sell as easily as they can buy or sell any other coin.

It's open source. Any body can "change" it. What they CAN'T do is force people to use it/mine it. Let them fork. If it's succesful, obviously there's demand for it. If there isn't demand, it will fail.
This isn't that hard.
Frankly, I look at forks like evolutionary stages, with the end result being either a better, stronger product that will survive, or a weaker one that will not. The only harm fro a fork comes from assuming you know exactly what will happen and dumping one of the coins only to see it bvecome the dominnat coin.
Just keep all your forked coins and you're covered either way.

But that would the be the case for any agreed upon global language, not just Esperanto.
There are no benefits to global adoption of Esperanto that global adoption of English, or Spanish, or Swahili would not also confer. Thus, Esperanto has no obvious upgrade.  The entire planet learning a new language would require a lot of time and resources. For that shift to happen, that language would have to present enough benefits to make it worthwhile. 
Bitcoin, on the other hand , presents a clear and obvious superiority to similar assets that it's widespread adoption seems much more likely.

Meh. I care about the price going up so I can retire early. Bitcoin is not going to end poverty, war or cause world peace. It's an extremely useful product, and that's what gives it value.
I don't understand the extreme emotional/romantic connection some ppl here have to it. It's an investment because I see value in it that isn't reflected yet in price.  Othing more, nothing less.
@_date: 2017-08-01 02:18:32
I don't think so. I hope not at least. That's the kind of shit that keeps institutional investors out, or prevents a bitcoin ETF, when the market appears obviously manipulated.
That said, Bitcoin has a market cap of $50 billion or so. That's probably too big for any group or cabal to manipulate. It would cost hundreds of millions to short it down, and if they got caught with their pants down, they could get squeezed real hard.

I think it will be pretty obvious which one will be called bitcoin. That is, I think there will be a clearly dominant coin, one that is uncontroversially dominant (say something with 90% of the post split value).
In a way, it's almost identical to biological evolution. A mutation has occurred, and now we watch to see which one gets naturally selected. At the end of the day, the environment around the two individuals will determine their success, not the individuals themselves.
At the end of the day, that's how forks should be looked at: as necessary evolutionary steps. In biology, as a species mutates through the generations, the strongest traits and mutations get selected, while the weak and inferior genes die off. The end result is a much hardier, stronger species, better suited to survive and thrive in it's specific environment. So too will it be for bitcoin. With each "mutation" (i.e. fork) natural selection will ensure the strongest, most advantageous traits survive while the weak ones die off. The end result will be a stronger, hardier currency better suited to survive and thrive in it's environment (the global financial system)

Unless they add hard caps and refuse to centrally command the currency, it would be no different from existing fiat currency. And those two things are the only reasons why they would WANT to create their own crypto. 
Bitcoin will always have a major role to play in the global financial system BECAUSE of hard caps and lack of central control.

THis is my feeling as well. Lots of people are going to decide to put in $1000 here or $2000 thre. THat's going to add up to a lot of new money flowing in. Also, I have a feeling big institutional investors with a higher risk appetite (hedge funds, private equity, HNW individuals etc) are slowly taking bites. Ppl with that kind of money don't buy in one chunk, it would skyrocket the price. The way big dips get bought up almost immediately is a classic accumulation pattern.

But why the hell would anybody do that? If you're just going to refill your BTC with fiat, why not just pay for your goods with fiat and keep the bitcoin? You're just going to pay transaction/brokerage fees when you refill with your fiat that you wouldn't have to pay of you just bought your goods with fiat in the first place.
Ppl aren't going to buy things in a deflationary currency in any significant numbers when they could but the same goods at the same price in an inflationary currency. They just won't, and no amount of ground breaking technology is going to change this fundamental human behavior.
Why are so many ppl so invested in this concept anyways? Why does it matter if BTC gets to $100k/coin because it's a medium of exchange instead of getting to $100k/coin because it's used as a store of value/inflation hedge?
I have no preference either way. If BTC gets widely adopted because it's used as a MoE rather then a SoV, that's great. If it gets widely adopted because ots used as a SoV instead of a MoE, thats great too,so long as it gets widely adopted, why do I care how ppl choose to use their BTC?
I  just dont think it's likely that a deflationary (by design) currency is ever likely to become widely used as a MoE when inflationary currencies are available to be used for the same purchase, based on everything we know about human economic behavior since we were stone aged apes.

Transaction time/fees is not what's driving price right now.  New money is.
You think the investor who recently became interestwd in Bitcoin because of all the favorable MSM coverage and plans on buying and holding for 10 years cares that much?
New money flowing in is what's driving price. And the vast majority of it is going into BTC. Most ppl haven't even heard of BCH
@_date: 2017-08-26 21:18:41
BCH is starting to look like it was created for the express purpose of lining the pockets of miners at the expense of buyers. The EDA is a windfall for them, at the expense of BCH price. It keeps pushing price lower and lower as it continuously reduces the cost of production indefinitely.

Since all addresses are public, it seems like searching for wallets that have been inactive for a sufficiently long period of time would be a pretty accurate estimate.

I think it will probably retest the $3000 level over the next few days. Or it could take off and never see $3400 again. It's honestly impossible to predict.

Pretty sure they're already split. Just wait for a major wallet to allow you to send BCH to it, and do so using the same paper wallet/key you have for your BTc. You can freely send BTC in the meantime, since they no longer have any connection to each other.
@_date: 2017-08-09 15:54:55
Except people would discount those alt coins (as they do now) and value would remain with the real bitcoin.
There have already been tons of alt coins split off from Blockchain. None of them remotely comes close to challanging Bitcoin (with the possible exception of ETH, but ETH isn't a Bitcoin clone, it has a different mission and different properties than BTC), and aside from crypto hobbyists, most ppl don't even know they exist. We can reasonably assume the future in this regard will look like the past.
@_date: 2017-08-14 19:15:32
The next time somebody talks about a bubble, ask them how many people they know personally that have invested in Bitcoin. For most people that answer in zero still.
Before the dot com bubble collapsed EVERYBODY was getting rich (on paper). Janitors and taxi drivers were giving their latest hot tips. It was everywhere.
That's the kind of engagement you need for  bubble. Bubbles pop because everyone has already bought in and tehre's nobody left to buy.
How much of the population is invested in BTC now? 5%? 2%? This isn't anywhere close to bubble territory yet.
You know how much money is currently invested in global assets? 
1. Private Wealth - $32 trillion
2. Pension Funds - $31 trillion
3. Insurance companies - $24 trillion
Those are just the top 3, all told it's about $120 trillion. Bitcoin will surely take some of that. If it takes even 1% of global asset share, you're still looking at $1.2 trillion. If that were Bitcoins market cap today, the price would be about $80,000/coin.
One thing I always like to point out about the dot com bubble....everybody who bought into the mania (even the ones who were wiped out) were right in the end. The Internet DID end up being a trans formative, transcendent technology that changed the entire world. They just got the timing wrong. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 14:50:01

Why would BTC crash though?
Because of high fees? There ios absoltely no evidence that suggests fees and price are correlated. In fact, judging by the past few days, where fees have shot up along with price, there is strong evidence they aren't correlated at all.
@_date: 2017-08-10 16:03:54
Shouldn't matter. Bitcoin isn't a global commodity priced in USD like oil or gold. It's priced in local currency in every jurisdiction.
The discrepancy between prices is a function of the exchange rates themselves.
There is no single reserve currency that BTC is priced relative too.
Edit: I should add, USD going down shouldn't affect the price of Bitcoin in other currencies DIRECTLY.  But in practice, it should support the price INDIRECTLY.  That is, as the USD goes down,Americans would likely be buying Bitcoin as a hedge against their local currency, which would, of course, push the price of BTC higher.

But those are just slogans that don't mean anything. 
Bitcoin will become a major piece of the global financial system, but it will just be a piece.  The global economic system is far too complex to just use one single medium of exchange, and the princeple of entropy means that it will get ever more complex. That's why Bitcoin came along, because the global financial system was increasingly more complex and needed something like Bitcoin. Note, I'm not saying Satoshi meant it to be that. I'm sure he didn't.  I'm saying that in massively complex  systems like the entirety of human civilization, solutions to major problems seem to eventually spontaneously appear, like in biological evolution  ("need to fly? Here ya go! There's a wing!"). Not from any sort of magic or sentient guidance, but from the sheer amount of permutations and computations of all the data humanity spits out.  Basically, nature "brute forces" solutions. Throw enough shit at the wall and eventually SOMEthing will stick. 
But now I'm getting off topic. Back to your point, I also really, really think you're vastly underestimating the amount of inertia built into the current financial system. When McNamara invented the seat belt at Ford, it took decades for it to reach above 50% usage. They couldnt undeestabd why. It saves lives, and it's so simple to do. Today it's a no-brainer, but as we've realized since then, it's really really hard to change someone's behavior. Even something that is good for them or will save their lives, we're just hardwired not to change. And that's for something stupid like seat belts, trying to change a behavior (driving) that had only been around for a few decades. How long do you think it would take to change the the most fundamental of human behaviors (exchanging physical resources for goods), stuff we've been doing since we were stone aged apes?
I mean....sure it could happen. It won't be seen in our lives though.  Or our children's.

I don't thinik you're going to be able to until it reaches wider mainstream acceptance.
The best way to do it is mention it now briefly, then as it gets talked about more and more in their mainstream news (it's already starting, MSM coverage has made a distinct turn from skepticism to cautious optimism recently) they'll be like "oh, that's that thing that Little Billy was telling us about" and they'll be more receptive to it later.

I would actually quibble with what I posted a bit. Obviously in retrospect, buying in 2007 was great. But it's easy to forget how stacked the odds were against it surviving, how many massive risks there were.
All things being equal, I'd rather invest in a $4000 coin thats been battle tested and built up an infrastructire that almost guarantees its dominance with 95% of its upside still ahead then invest in a $100 untested coin with 99.9% of its gains ahead.
The reason the earliest adopters were so richly rewarded is because they took on enormous risk when nobody else would. Risk is always inversely correlated with return.

My guess is, for the next few weeks, as the price of BCH stabalizes, BTC and BCH will probably trade inverse to each other, which makes sense considering both are two parts to the same whole. As price discovery locks in the "true" value of BCH, it stands to reason that speculators and automated trading will balance the ledger on the BTC side, even if we don't have 100% of ppl selling BCH then dump it into BTC

so then invest in gold. It's not anyone job to convince you. If you don't get it, we don't have time to explain it to you.

@_date: 2017-08-05 02:35:04
Yes, but none of this obscures the simple fact that if I know something will be more valuable tmr, I have a strong disincentive to spend it today. Especially when I have the option of using ANOTHER medium of exchange for the same purchase that I know will be worth LESS tomorrow.

Yeah but nobody "decides" what the underlying value should be. It doesn't matter what any one person BELIEVES the value to be. 
All that matters is the supply and demand of the shares in existence. The market always sniffs out value. If there are a million shares out there, the market will get the price roughly in line with it's value. It jsut happens, nobody "does" it.
 It may seem magical, but it happens in every market humans have ever set up. And it will happen in this one. Even Bitcoin is subject to the laws of supply and demand.

Except you're forgetting that for the 99% of consumers who AREN'T Bitcoin ideologists and care only about making the most financially rational decisions, why would they do this?
Spending Bitcoin costs fees. Replacing your Bitcoin with fiat also costs fees. Plus, as you mention, Bitcoin goes up more then it goes down, so more often then not youère going to have to replace your Bitcoin at higher fiat prices.
You know what costs no fees whatsoever? paying in fiat. 
So they'll pay a fee to spend their Bitcoin, pay a fee to replenish it, and there's a really good chance the exact same amount of fiat will buy less BTC by the time thye can replace it. 
Add all that up, and there is simply no way in hell that the average consumer is going to behave this way, and the tiny sliver of Bitcoin purists is not going to be enough. You NEED that critical mass of consumers to use Bitcoin in order to see the future you envision.
Just use common sense and come to grips with the fact that Bitcoin is a new investment class and act accordingly. It is not, nor ever will be, used primarily as a currency, for all kinds of reasons. The ones above are just a few.

This is the dumbest idea in the world. Not only do shorters play a crucial role in price discovery, they play a crucial role in stabilizing price.
You realize anything sold short has to later on be bought back right? During crashes like this, shorters covering their shorts are often the only buyers. without shorters buying these dips, we'd be down way further.
In any case, anybody willing to put their money in the market and take the same risks as everyone else is entitled to the same rewards as everyone else.
The market could just as easily go against them and many times short squeezes are the main fuel source for a bull market. I'm sure you didn't complain when shorters who got crushed and had to cover their shorts at higher prices propelled the markets higher did You?

It is among the most deflationary assets that exist.
"Deflationary" does not mean no more supply can ever be brought on line. If that was the definition nothing would ever be deflationary. All it means is that it's supply will grow at a slower rate then the inflationary fiat currencies it is priced in.
The financial system has never seem an asset as deflationary as Bitcoin, with its hard limit.
More importantly though is the PERCEPTION that Bitcoin is deflationary. Indeed, this hard cap on coins is one of its main selling points and why so many point to it as a solid inflation hedge. As long as the PERCEPTION is that the price in fiat will be higher in the future then it is Now, ppl won't spend it.
Which is why, 10 years and hundreds of billions of dollars into the crypto experiment, no cryptos are being used in any significant way as a medium of exchange. If it was going to happen, we'd be seeing at least signs of mass merchant acceptance. We're not. The opposite in fact, as there is LESS crypto acceptance by merchants today then there was a year or two ago.

If they don't see the utility or obvious value in such a technology, I really don't have the time to explain it further. Some ppl just won't get it.

Many people (me included) don't see the future of bitcoin as a medium of exchange used for everyday purchases. It's deflationary nature will disincentivize spending and encourage saving.
A much more natural fit for Bitcoin, IMO, is as an asset class, performing the role that gold does today as an inflation hedge/store of value. It's deflationary nature (as well as precise, real time supply info)  make it ideally suited for this role, superior to gold. It also will likely play a role as a safe haven, a place to park your cash during times of geopolitical turmoil. Again, it would be superior to the current assets playing this role (gold, ¥, and to a lesse extent, sovergn debt) due to it being OUTside the global financial system. Putting your money into the Japanese Yen, for example, won't do you much good if the geopolitical turmoil causing the issue is North Korea nuking Tokyo. Bitcoins decentralized nature make it ideal as a safe haven.
I expect it will be best practice for every investment portfolio in the world to hold some allocation of Bitcoin (say 5 or 10%). If this comes to pass, the market cap will be in the trillions and the coin price would be easily into 6 figures.

He's either dead or otherwise lost access to it (most likely) or he's the insanely rare kind of person who can have billions of dollars in an account that he chooses not to touch. If it's the former, obviously that money moves. And If it's the latter, it probably never moves. If he's not going to touch it at $4+ billion, i don't see why he would ever.

Can't find the original annoucnement (I'm sure it's in Chinese anyway). Everything I've seen looks like it's just ICO's
Now, this is actual bad news for Etherium, because Etherium is often the currency of choice for ICO's. It has no bearing on the value proposition/utility of Bitcoin though. I suspect once the initial shock wears off (hopefully later today) there's going to be a powerful buy pressure on Bitcoin, as investors realize it doesn't affect it directly.
@_date: 2017-09-04 19:06:27
Yes. Assuming BTC manages to get a critical mass of widespread adoption to ensure it's long term survival, it's price will always go up against fiat currencies.

No, it doesn't work like that. I know you aren't suggesting this, but the logic seems to imply that there's some "governing body" or group of people who decide price, and if they have no way of knowing how many coins are lost, then they cannot price it in.
The price, like any product/asset, is determined by supply and demand. Every coin that actually IS lost is one coin that will never be put onto a market to be sold, ever again. While one coin lost won't make a difference, the combined effect of all lost coins will definitely have a long term, continuous effect on the price of Bitcoin. There is no need to try to determine which coins are lost and which aren't. The market will sniff it out, like it always does. Think about currencies that become hyperinflationary. Do you think the Weimar Republic in the 30's was telling people exactly how many notes they were printing, and thus, mathematicians could figure out what the inflation rate should be? Of course not. But the mere act of adding the notes to the supply chain meant that inevitably, the balance of supply and demand would be affected, and the currency would depreciate because of it.
And in any case,  unlike almost any other currency, we likely WILL have a pretty accurate idea of how many coins are lost, considering all addresses are public. It seems reasonable to have a specific cut off date, say 5 years, where if any account is inactive for that long, all coins inside it can be considered "lost". Obviously, not everyone will be. There may be jsut some people who don't touch their coins for 5+ years. But that seems like the extreme exception rather then the rule. My guess is of all addresses not touched for 5+ years, 95%+ will be genuinely lost (although I'd probably put in an exception for Satoshi's coins, due to the unique circumstances, even though I don't believe those coins will ever move.)

That's inflation though, not debt. And inflation isn't inherently bad. A little inflation is necessary, because we all know what happens when a currency becomes deflationary: people don't spend it, and the economy suffers.
Incidentally, that's why I don't believe Bitcoin's future is primarily as a medium of exchange. It's incredibly deflationary.
I know I sure wouldn't spend mine (at least not on everyday purchases. A house, or a car or a boat or something, sure). Why would I when it's going to be worth more in the future, when I can pay for that coffee in currency that will be worth less in teh future?

Each country's exchanges are basically a closed system that will often differ from other countries exchanges. 
The spread between exchange prices would likely be roughly equivalent to the cost of the fees/exchange rate conversions between the countries.
As the Bitcoin market matures,you will likely have large hedge funds with a presence (and fiat)in the countries involved will arbitrage the spreads closer together.

There will be two distinct phases. We're currently in the growth phase, characterized by huge volatility, but large returns. This will probably take 10-20 years. After that, the mature phase, as Bitcoin settles into whatever role it assumes (what that role is is still very much up for debate), it will be much less volatile, and much more stable. The returns will be much lower but so will the risk.
I see the price at maturity as probably in the 6 figures. POSSIBLY 7 if some things go very right.

Except you're fundamentally not understanding how Moser  economic systems work.
A currency that does not inflate is useless as a currency. In consumer driven economies (I.e. every developed econony) a low inflation is NEEDED to incentivize spending. We already know what happens in consumer economies when their currency goes deflationary (I.e. Japan's lost decade) and it isn't pretty.
The same way that slight inflation incentivizes the spending necessary in a consumer economy, deflation Disincentives it. If your dream of an economy run on a currency as deflationary as Bitcoin ever came to pass, we'd see the Great Depression 2.0.

Lol I guess in home school Mom never taught you that theories are great, but they tend to get trumped when we have real world examples to point too.
I'm not giving you my opinion. I'm giving you the observable facts: when currencies become deflationary in consumer economies, spending goes down, and the entire economy goes into free fall. I pointed out a specific real world example.
Perhaps you should've spent more time in those public schools you hate so much. You'll learn about empiricism and fact based theoretical models.
The idea that wealth causes spending is absurd on its face (from a macro economic standpoint). A billionaire still only sleeps on one bed at a time. Still only drives one car at a time. Of course a if you win the lottery tomorrow, your personal spending will increase. Thats not what improves economies. I'm talking about macro economic consumption.

yep. The only thing that matters is supply vs demand. They will always move precisely inverse to each other.
If you increase supply without touching demand, price will go down, always, and vice versa. We don't need to "know". It's the invisible hand of the market. The market always knows (eventually...it can be fooled for a while, but never indefinitely)
@_date: 2017-09-02 23:58:31
I'm not as familiar with Litecoin, could you summarize the properties you're referring too?
In any case, in my hypothetical scenario, where Bitcoin is primarily a brand new asset class, the most important factors are not tx times or fees, those aren't meaningless, but they pale in importance to investors as the size of the market and liquidity.  Bitcoin doesn't have to be the technologically superior coin (this is a big part of why I disagree with the BCH crowd. They may very well be right about the technical improvements, I just don't think it will matter. Investors  priority is always to be able to get out if they need too,and for that, you need liquidity, and for that you need pure market size.
And Bitcoins current dominant market size advantage is likely to be insurmountable. It will create a poaitive feedback loop that perpetuates its dominance. As new money continues to pour in to crypto, ,the vast majority will go to Bitcoin because it's the biggest, most established market. In turn, because most of the money flows to Bitcoin, it will naturally increase in size more and more then the other coins, which will make it even MORE attractive to the next round of money that flows in and so on and so forth.
@_date: 2017-09-03 16:34:48
Because Bitfinex and Bitstamp are not in America and the other two are.
There isn't really one global Bitcoin market, like, say oil. Each country has a collection of exchanges that are basically a closed system. Of course since they all trade the exact same coins, they'll all be highly correlated. 
The differences in prices between exchanges of different countries should be roughly equivalent to what it would cost in fees/exchange rate to move money between the two countries.
If the discrepancy between two exchanges becomes MORE then it would cost to exchange currencies, then it becomes profitable to pay those fees in order to arbitrage the difference in BTC prices.
You'll notice exchanges in the same country (or at least, use the same currency, in the case of Europe) will have almost identical prices. THat's because it's basically free to arbitrage any discrepancy, since all you won't be paying exchange rates.

It could be do-able.
The same dynamic that would make a person leery of spending their BTC (it's deflationary nature means that most consumers would exoect it to be worth more in the future) is the same reason why some merchants would WANT to be paid in BTC.

Which ones specifically?
A fork means that both coinsshare an identical blockchain up until the split. Nobody has to "give" anybody extra coins. They just have it, so long as they own their own keys.
Whatever address/private key you had your BTC in at the moment of the fork, you'll have the exact same amount of coins, wiht the exact same wallet and exact same private key automatically.
@_date: 2017-09-03 01:24:13
No, the trend is "Bitcoin up, altcoins up slightly less then BTC (i.e. BTC outperforms altcoins even though they are both going up)" and vice versa: When Bitcoin is down, the alts go down too, but not as much, i.e. the alts outperform Bitcoin.
But they generally tend to trade quite in lockstep. The reason is all the automated trading in the crypto markets. There are almost certainly many bots that have algorithms where they buy one coin when it goes down a predetermined % vs BTC and sell it when it goes up a predetermined % vs BTC. Put enough of these bots to work and you get with waht we see: a crypto market that GENERALLY (some huge exceptions apply, of course) trades together.

Ugh. This is just a dumb slogan that doesn't actually mean anything that ppl heard on Zeitgeist and repeat it because they thinkit makes them sound smart.
Money is just a way to store and bottle "value" usually in the form of labor. As society became ever more complex,it became cumbersome and impractical to rely primarily on the barter system, and so it became necessary for a person to "store" the value their labor created so they could then later purchase goods and services. That's it. Even IF fiat currency is created "through debt " (it isnt) it doesn't matter in any practical sense. Can you hold onto it for later use? Can you exchange it for goods and services? If you answered yes, then congrats, the currency you're using has accomplished the goals it set out to do. 
Whether it's USD, gold, or coral shells, if you can exchange it for goods and services, that's all that matters to you. Unless you're trying to sound profound on Redddit. THEN it matters if it's actually "debt".
I would challenge you to explain, in detail, in a way that is logically sound and rational, exactly how this process works.
I'll wait.
@_date: 2017-09-04 02:59:52
I agree. I think, in the end, there will be one obviously dominant coin, with maybe a few niche ones. I think a lot of the money in alts are going to slowly bleed into one primary coin. My bets on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-21 17:54:39
it's still way, way more complicated then simply handing over fiat or using your debit card.
You're acting like it's the most natural and normal thing in the world for consumers jump through a bunch of hoops, take time out of their day to replenish their BTC, hope the price hasn't jumped since the purchase AND pay 3% fees for the privilege.....for what end?
When consumers are faced with two options and one requires tiome, effort and fees and the other requires no time, no effort and no fees, they're going to take option B 100% of the time.
This is such a self evident truth I'm surprised it even has to be mentioned.
Now, if the merchant is going to offer a discount, say 5-10%, THAT could incentivize such a process. But unless and until that happens, this whole idea is absurd.

"value is determined by supply and demand"
I'd quibble with this a little. I'd say PRICE is determined by supply and demand. "Value" is the underlying fundamental
Example, if a company has a market cap of $1 billion, that's it's value. No matter how many shares (i.e. supply) you add, the value won't change, but price will.
If the company has one billion shares outstanding, the price per share will be $1. If it has one share, the price per share will be $1 billion. If it has 10 shares outstanding, the price will be $100 million, and so on.
You can mess with supply as much as you want, and price will change dramatically. But the underlying value will never change, it's still a $1 billion company.

I wouldn't say that. BCC is already trading on futures markets. As far as markets are concerned, the splits already happened and the value of BCC siphoned off.
If markets know something is going to happen for sure, they don't wait to price it in until it does. Everybody knows the fork is going to occur, hte market has already priced it in, clearly.
If one thinks otherwise, they could short BTC and get guaranteed profits. But of course, no profits are ever guaranteed.

Just store your coins on a paper wallter (or at least a non custodial wallet) and don't worry about it. The danger zone is AFTER August 1 but BEFORE a clear direction has shaken out. Any coins held before any potential fork will be fine. Coins held before the fork will get an equal amount of coins on both forks.
@_date: 2017-07-31 22:54:07
Well, I assume that's part of what's happening, which is explaining why BTC is at all time highs the day before the fork. Because some traders think there's an arbitrage opportunity. Ppl are buying because they expect they'll get the price of BTC right now PLUS whatever BCC is worth.
I could also turn your question around, if what YOU are saying is correct, why would you not just short as much as you can, since there's "guaranteed" profits when the price goes down? 
@_date: 2017-07-31 23:11:59
43,000 short positions vs 15,000 long positions.
whoa. I wouldn't feel good at all holding shorts going into the fork. If it doesn't drop hard and fast almost immediately, some itchy fingers are going to close their shorts awful fast. If all these shorts start stampeding for the exits, we could be looking at a massive short squeeze. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 14:11:36
I'm actually expecting a drop after the fork. The whole "buy the rumor, sell the news" thing.
Plus, it seems obvous that you'd want to be in BTC on Aug 1. Why not? You get 1 free BCC. Whether BCC is worthless or not, it's still free.
That's why you're seeing ETH go down strongly relative to BTC. Crypto investors are overwight BTC going into the fork. I'd look for ETH to outperform BTC over the next few weeks starting August 1 though, as investors got their BCC and pile back into ETH

Doubt it. Bitcoin will play a major role  in the global financial system, but it won't be this.
It seems unlikely governments will allow cryptos to be accepted as legal tender. It will be like gold: traded globally, used as an inflation hedge and safe haven, but not really used in everyday transactions. You will need to convert it to local cuyrrency, like you would with gold.
I believe it will cannabalize about 5-10% from asset classes such as gold and forex, which would give it a price in the hundreds of thousands, if not millions.

This doesn't seem to make sense. In the authors example, Stuart and Alice BOTH get 1 BCC. The rules seem to not allow that. Margin longs and margin shorts will NOT recieve nor pay BCC. So in the example, Alice will get 1 BCC (since she has an account balance of 1 BTC, even though it is lent out). Stuart won't get any BCC since he is on margin (all shorts are, by definition, on margin).

Uncertainty is always a death sentence for any security. BIP 91 locking in gets rid of a whole lot of uncertainty.
Bit coin especially is susceptible to it since it's so new and there's so much sckepticism in the mainstream finance world. This sort of thing is the thing that's needed to get the large instiutional investors in, which is when it's REALLY going to take off. I'm buying all I can under $4000. Today's prices are the kind of thing your grandkids will be astounded about.
"wow granddad, Bitcoin was only $2500 when you were a kid? Man you're ollllllld"
It's like getting in on Berkshire Hathaway at $20/share. Obviously, you always want to buy lower then higher, but if you bought at $20, or $50 or even $1000/share, it doesn't matter much. You're fucking loaded today regardless

I've got a long history investing smart, and dumb. I've made money, and lost it. I know firsthand how important it is to have conviction in your trade. If you don't believe in your trade, it is literally impossible to stomach those kinds of losses. Your mind starts going crazy "this couldn't go to zero right? COULD it go to zero?! ....Fuck it, I'm out" it's just human nature. You NEED a strong conviction if you're investing in a high risk instrument like this.  Like I said above, if you truly believe in it, you WANT it to go down, so you can get more at a discount. Without conviction, it's very easy to get shaken out. The worst part is, often times after you get shaken out, the price rebounds to back where you thought it was.

When I read the headlines on MSM sites like CNBC that "Bitcoin civil war could lead to split by August 1" I knew there'd be a big dip to buy before then. Frankly I figured it wouldn't happen until later in the month but was ready for it this weekend.
The BTC miners have so many billions invested in their infrastructure by now, there's no way this wasn't going to be resolved quickly and satisfactorily.

yeah but consider the fact that almost everybody who dumps BCC will immediately plow it into BTC....thus, while you may be losing value on your BCC, you should be gaining a roughly equal amount of value on your BTC.

Bitcoin needs regulation in order to get to the next level and achieve widespread adoption.
It's not like BTC itself will ever be regulated. It can't be. The regulation will occur at the choke points (the exchanges where BTC is converted into local currency). This is a good thing that should be encouraged.

You can do that right now on viaBTC. Transfer your BTC there and they'll give you an equal # of BCC and place a hold on your BTC. You could sell your BCC immediately.

I understand, but what if you wait for a price that never comes? We may never see $2k again. And then by the time you realize that, it's now at $4k.
I'd rather just buy now. If it goes down, I'll buy even more.

First rule of thumb about anything to do with investing. If you're "sure" something will happen, and everyone else is "sure" will happen, it never actually will.
There are so many different factors that go into the price discovery of a complex, highly traded investment vehicle that it's a fools game to try to figure out exactly why something is happenning or not. It's likely dozens of different factors all playing off each other.
Bitcoin is going to be highly volatile and unpredictable. It could go to $1500 before it goes to $3000 again. You need to be prepared for that mentally.
The only way to keep your mental health in Bitcoin is to believe in it. Take a longer term view. Study blockchain technology, and think about what problems in the current global financial system it will solve. If you believe in it, and you decide that it IS going to be a transcendent technology, then just be secure in that and ignore the minutiae of the daily price action. 
Without that solid conviction backstopping your investment, there's no way in hell you'll be able to stomach the swings this thing is going to go through over the next few years. A good example is last weekend. If I didn't have such a strong conviction in the future of BTC, I would've sold my entire position when it dropped 20% over the weekend. Because of it, however, I was comfortable buying all through the weekend in small chunks every few hours. By the time the recovery started on Monday, I was able to accumulate close to 5 bitcoins at prices that we may never see again. And if we DO see them again, I'll happily scoop up more.
If you truly believe in BTC, you're happy to see it go down, because all it means is you're getting a steep discount on it's way up. If you don't believe in it, you shouldn't be invested in it. It'll keep you up all night and drive you insane.

The problem is, BCC could end up being BTC. Not likely, but the one thing I know for sure about cryptocurrencies in general is that the forces and dynamics powering their evoultion are far too complex for any one person to understand.
Just hold onto both coins until the dust settles. ANd to be clear, that could take weeks or months before we get real clarity.

This is a good thing. I know BTC started as a libertarian dream, the fact remains, if one is buying BTC  as an investment  (and thus, one you hope will increase in monetary value) there's going to have to be SOME regulation and oversight in order for it to have the credibility needed to have widespread adoption.

I don't know why everybody is talking about this like it's a disaster. To me it seems like a huge positive, and will unlock the potential of Bitcoin (whichever fork goes on to dominate). That's how it's supposed to work.
If there are irreconcilable differences, just split the coin, and let the market decide which is better. It is the best possible outcome for the long term health of bitcoin.

I expect a general melt up for the foreseeable future, 2 steps forward, 1 step back. If you're looking for parabolic moves though, that's going to need a specific event to power through. There's a few events I can think of to cause such a rise. 
1) approval of a BTC etf that trades on a major exchange (not the one on the pink sheets that trades now). That will flow hundreds of billions into cryotocurrencies, with BTC getting by far the Lions share, and prices would rocket up on the news.
2) Central banks start buying. This will give BTC mainstream credibility and greatly improve the sentiment. And of course the sheer buying that would happen would likely propel BTC into the 5 figures.
3) Major institutional investors  (hedge funds, mutual funds, pension funds etc) starting to see the potential and investing. I see BTC carving out an entirely new asset class eventually, taking on some of the properties of several of them, including gold and forex, while distinct enough to forge an entirely new class. They won't allocate a huge % of their portfolio, as it's way too risky for their tastes, but a few of the more daring ones already are (Bill Miller holds Bitcoins). Even if the big funds  allocate an average  1-2%, that's still going to mean tens of billions in total flowing into BTC. And these guys are all trend followers by nature. Once a few of them venture out and make serious returns, they'll all pile.in
THESE are the things that will power the next parabolic rise (into the 5 figures). Until one of them (or something similar) happens, we'll likely see a slow rise, with lots of uncomfortable sell offs in between.
That's just how securities trade. Nothing ever goes up in a straight line. Every leg up will cause some traders who got in lower to take profits, and we need to get fresh money rotated in to power higher.
This is a years long investment, obsessing over the day to day price moves will drive you nuts.

This is just the dinosaurs unable to comprehend change. I fail to see how bitcoins are any less "real" then a $100 bill. The bill is worth, in "reality" nothing more then the paper it's printed on. But in practical terms, it has value because we know that OTHERS accept it as valuable, and we will have no problem using it to purchase goods and services. Therefore, we too accept it as "real" and give it value.
Bitcoin is the exact same. It has value because we know there are millions of people who ALSO consider it valuable. There definitely was a period when BTC could be said to not be "real", but once BTC made it through that period (which it did, years and years ago) and reached a critical mass of users who consider it valuable, there is no going back.
There's a simple test you can do when someone tells you something isn't "real" or has no value: ask them to give you some of it. Lots of people will say "fiat currency is not backed by anything like gold! Therefore, it's not real and has no value". To these idiots, I would say "ok, here's a $100 bill. since it has no value, you'll have no problem burning it right now". Of course in this hypotehtical scenario, they never woudl. Why not? Because the cash has value and they know it. To anybody who says BTC isn't real and has no value, ask them if they found a private key/address with 1 BTC in it....would they give it to you? When the answer is (naturally) "of course not" they will have proven beyond a doubt that there is value there.

Fair point. 
I agree with your overall premise, there are other factors to consider that I think will play a role that could propel BTC  higher as soon as tmr.
The sky high short interest is a ticking time bomb. As well, there will almost certainly be new money coming in after the uncertainty of the hard fork is cleared up. Not to mention, what do you think all thos3 BCC sellers will do with their profits tmr? My guess is 90% of them will immediately plow it back into BTC, thus supporting price.
In a vacuum, sure, the price of BTC should go down equal to the price of BCC, but there are other dynamics at play too.

I'm actually not too worried about price.  I'm not trading this. This is, buy as much as you can, stuff it away and forget about it for 20 years.
So of course I'd prefer it to be cheaper. But considering my long time frame and where I think this will go, I'm just buying all I can until I reach my goal (10 bitcoins).
I believe this will be a truly game changer in global finance, and will eventually trade as the world's primary reserve currency. I don't even want to make predictions, but I would be surprised if bitcoin isn't at least at $100,000 within 5 years, and eventually will trade for millions per coin. With that sort of Outlook, does it matter if you got in at $2000 or $3000?
@_date: 2017-07-20 19:12:40
Can't think of it like that. You have to consider the risk/reward. Back then, the risk was unimaginable. To think BTC would EVER get to where it was even now would have been unthinkable.
Yes, it's more expensive now, but after everything BTC has gone through, to trade where it is now, with most of it's gains ahead of it, not behind, is a much better proposition to buy now then then.
I'd much rather buy @ $3000 with it's history of resiliance backstopping it then @ $100 without ever really being tested.

I think around $500. I agree with the above. I certainly wouldn't do it right now. BCC could end up being the primary chain (unlikely, but possible).
@_date: 2017-07-31 19:23:56
To be clear, I don't either. I think BCC will flounder around as niche among the "purists" while BTC goes on to carve out a niche as a new asset class in the global financial system.
But I don't know for sure, and anybody who says they do is lying to you. Selling either coin within the next few weeks seems to be huge risk for little potential reward.
@_date: 2017-07-20 13:49:12
hopefully. Who wouldn't love a chance to pick up more at a discount?

whoa whoa whoa...."work"? Get your priorities in order pal ;)
@_date: 2017-07-31 21:45:57
Yes but if you sell your BCC tmr when everybody else is and thus sell way below fair market value, you're losing value.
ETC didn't go to zero and neither will BCC. I don't know the price tmr but I can almost guarantee the price tomorrow will be lower then the price one month from now.
And again, what if BCC becomes the dominant chain? Show me someone who says they know 100% what will happen after the fork and I'll show you a fool.
@_date: 2017-07-31 17:40:14
I'm not even go9ing to try to get cute here. Why bother? Anybody who says they know for sure what's going to happen post fork is a liar or a fool. We don't know if one coin will dominate (or which coin that may be) or if each split the value equally or in any other proportion.
To that end, why kill yourself trying to figure out the unfigureout-able? Just hold both coins, and you're gold no matter which one wins.
Would suck big time dumping BCC to buy BTC only to have BCC become the dominant coin. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 20:07:11
Correct. Howard Marks had a hard fork several years ago. The real Marks loves BTC. This Marks is the barely mined alt Marks.
