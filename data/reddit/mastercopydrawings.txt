Im a scumbag because I tried it instead of sitting on the sidelines and criticizing it. 
I have learnt a lot from just giving it a go, I would strongly advise only putting in what you can afford to lose - it is a very real possibility you will lose - I can also say that there isn't a trading bot like the site says, that is bs. 
They take advantage of the Bitcoin success - much safer to just keep money in Bitcoin imo - BUT the interest does pay everyday (on day 13 now) and allows you to reinvest (and this is the key) thus creating compound interest (the 8th wonder of the world don't you know?) which over time, if it doesn't go bust, will make you money and has made some early adopters a lot of money (with or without referrals) . 
It's not regulated so it can't be shut down by government - YET!. They own LOTS of Bitcoin and convert your Bitcoin to their own coin so they can't really lose - the trick is to not get greedy and start cashing out when you are getting a nice amount of interest - some people are still reinvesting at $100k which is mad imo....I dislike the sales patter that many people give it, like its somehow infallible and in anyway like Bitcoin - it absolutely isn't and is NOTHING like Bitcoin - it is basically a vulture coin benefiting from Bitcoin. But you can earn from it, and why not?... So rather than call names, I tried it and can give a real account of how it works. My youtube channel does not sell it, just gives you a real life account of how it works and my thoughts. (and yes there is a referral link but I am giving the commission back to people who join from my link - and I am earning without referrals anyway so it doesn't matter)
Cheers.  
More info on my channel. Don't get carried away with the hype.

I am very skeptical but had to try it. Follow my journey. I'm on day 2 average of 1.4%
