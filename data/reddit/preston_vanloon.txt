No. 
How can you be so certain that it wasn’t sent on 12/24?
A few examples:
- The transaction was sent on 12/24 to a single node that held onto it until 1/3.
- The transaction was sent on 12/24 but replaced by a higher fee transaction on 1/3 because it was taking so long
- The transaction was censored by all miners colluding together not to mine your transaction until 1/3 because they have a grudge against you
There is no way to prove any of the scenarios above with absolute certainty.

+1. Also, It’s very easy for the buyer to dispute the transaction on PayPal and they almost always side with the buyer. They will get their $180 back and keep your bitcoin.

So you are worried about your coins being stolen, but they haven’t stolen it yet? Move the coins to a new wallet!

I think it’s clear that the authors intent was to mention individuals or companies that specialize in blockchain technologies such as cryptocurrency or distributed systems via blockchain. 
Comparing a blockchain to a linked list is like comparing a distributed database to a text file. It’s not just some objects with reference pointers to the previous object that came before it...

I think the chance of the chain being orphaned is very low after a few blocks since it gets more expensive as the chain grows. It just depends on the amount of BTC and if it’s worth spending the effort for a 51% attack to orphan the chain with your transaction.  
In short, if you are confident that the sender doesn’t control 51% of the bitcoin network hashpower then 1 block confirmation is fine. 2 blocks is better, but 1 should be ok.

I bet you would call a computer a calculator ��

Too bad you can’t write off bitcoin due to loss or theft. 
Edit: not sure why someone downvoted me. This is the IRS’s rule that if you lose or someone steals your BTC then you do not get any deduction or sympathy from the IRS.

This is solid advice. Even if the law changes in the future, you won’t be off the hook. You are still liable for taxes owed in the law at the time of those past transactions. Unless the law was changed retroactively and the IRS would have to give the money back, but I doubt this will ever happen so just pay your taxes.

I like how OP covered up the barcode numbers but not the barcode itself.
Hey OP, the barcode is the same data as the numbers! That’s how the scanner reliably reads the number from the label.

No and I can’t wait for the Google Ads ban to take effect. I’m sick of seeing shitty ICO ads everywhere I go.

They may not be equipped yet but your making record on a public ledger. As soon as they are equipped and the moment a wallet is linked to you then you’ll be paying back taxes and fines.
