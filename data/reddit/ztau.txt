That's probably one of the main reasons Gavin Andresen still refers to Bitcoin as an experiment.  We are all in a sense beta-testers for a very new form of technology and should be mindful of that as flaws are discovered and it is improved.

I gotta say the dessert coffee jokes are among the few things helping to keep me sane through all this. :)

This is one of the main flaws in bitcoin, and until this is fixed (assuming it *can* be), it will remain a currency only for geeks and speculators.

Have you returned to Australia, or will you be continuing your protest until you get back your coins?  It would be very disappointing to go all the way there only to return empty-handed.
If you are still there, I'm sure we'd all appreciate you sharing any further developments, along with maybe an excerpt from your video or a photo or two to show us what the place looks like.
At any rate, hats off to you for doing what I'm sure many of us would like to have done, and what the established news media should be doing.  If a similar situation arose with a large bank, they'd be all over it with reporters and live tv vans.

I remember when it gave out 5 BTC per visitor. *sigh*

"**most** of them were speculators that allowed *greed* to overcome their common sense."
Really?  That's one hell of a generalisation.  Had it occurred to you that some people that sent their coins to gox may have done so simply to prevent losing their cash value at a ridiculous and totally unsustainable ~$1200 all-time-high?
As for common sense, Gox was the largest and longest-running exchange, and while it has been through situations some would characterise as red flags, the fact that it recovered from every one of them was to me an indicator of strength and resiliency, and that's why I sent my coins there.
Now while each day of this increasingly depressing situation unfolds it seems more and and more likely that I made a vast error in my judgement, please don't characterise the majority of gox customers as greedy and blinkered morons who deserve to lose every cent.
It's that kind of cold-hearted backstabbing that makes dogecoin in comparison such an appealing alternative to the bitcoin community.

You shouldn't be joking about stuff like that. Downvoted.

Why not BC (BitCoin) rather than BT?  BT doesn't seem as obvious to me.

If you have a look at the chart, you can see several large sells near the top.  The price began to recover at 245 but then another sell occurred at 254.  Based on previous movements, the price should have stabilised and would either have continued up or plateau'd for a while, but the increasing lag combined with the large sells no doubt triggered people's panic buttons (who had been waiting for the inevitable bubble to burst).  The DDOSers no doubt capitalised on people's increasing anxiety as the price moved further up into uncharted waters, and after enough poking they were able to initiate a chain reaction of selloffs.
Normally, people tend to wait and see everyone else's reaction to the sells before moving, but the fact that there was so much delay in receiving ticker data from the exchange prevented anyone from doing that.
I'm no expert, but that's my best guess on what happened.

No worries, good to know others have a similar take on what happened. :)
Hopefully the changes Mt. Gox plans to implement will stop this from happening again or at least make the exchange more robust against these kinds of attacks.

A decentralised and trustworthy method for people to exchange their cash for bitcoins would be ideal, but I'm just not sure if something like that is possible.  I understand that [ripple]( could be a solution though.
But until that happens I think the best we can hope for is for some established and already well-known currency exchanges to start trading bitcoins.  That will at least spread the risk, and provide Mt. Gox with some much-needed serious competition.

It made it to 75+ minutes.  Insanely Ridiculous.
