I'd go even further to say: *If you are not the sole possessor of the private keys, you don't own the bitcoins.*

And yet, if you liqudated them and tried to spend all that cash on bitcoin, you couldn't buy them all.

False. Allow me to quote myself:


Emphasis mine.

That's true. The difference is that the government can print more money. My household cannot.

I think you have failed to make the effort to understand your political opponent's position. If someone believes that it's unethical for anyone to inflate the money supply, then that would apply to households and governments alike. Dismissively labelling the argument as a fallacy and refusing to internalize it just makes you, well, a dick.

Comments over there are surprisingly negative.
*Who are these people?*

Certainly a simple arithmetic operation is difficult to get wrong, but that doesn't mean that the rest of the code is safe from bugs resulting from that change.

I'm calling bullshit. Your terms are overly vague and nondescript. What the fuck is "hard overheating"?
Give a concrete example supporting your implication that monetary policy (inflating the money supply) is a good thing. Back it up with metrics, or GTFO.

What text do you own the copyright for?

You don't understand the concepts you are nattering about. Being free to speak does not mean others are forced to agree with you or like what you're saying.

I don't think I would consider inflation a "feature".
@_date: 2013-05-02 15:12:43
@_date: 2013-01-06 03:05:25
I'm aware, it's just that "feature" has a positive connotation, and it's not something I would consider positive.

Couldn't disagree more. Gambling is not saving, especially for the people that lose.

Wages track inflation *eventually*. In the meantime, the people that get the new money first (those with connections to government) have the advantage of spending it while it is still valued higher, while the working class has to pay more and more for the basics until that money finally works its way into their pay raise. It's always too late, and they always take a hit. It is for this reason that inflation punishes the poor most of all.

Oh, I'm certainly aware of that tired old theory, but I cannot rationalize theft in such a way.
