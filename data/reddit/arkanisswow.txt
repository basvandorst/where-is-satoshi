Don't call them an Anarchist, not only is that probably not true, but they were acting as a rioter or criminal when they assaulted someone.

better question is: "Do you ask someone how much money they have in their bank account?"

* Your use of the term "cronies" is more telling than anything. But to reference history, appointing leaders of industry to advisory positions is extremely common. 


* The Dodd-Frank bill hardly leashed anything and the repeal will make it easier to lend to small businesses, whether or not legislation is necessary to prevent wallstreet from being "unleashed" is an important discussion to have. Keep in mind that the underlying problem with the housing crash in 07 and subsequent depression of 08 was the implementation of legislation in 94 called the fair housing act. You can't force banks to loan money to people that don't have the money or the credit for a house. 
You can look into this matter further, here is an article from 2009.


* Many regard this as a great pick for Secretary of state, Rex has a lot of relations already built and due to Exxon Mobile's ethos regarding international relations, is already used to acting in a similar fashion. If Trump wasn't so contentious, this pick wouldn't be very contentious. 


* You would have to substantiate further for this to be anything except rhetoric, He has stated that taking over the oil fields in Iraq and the middle east was the right move to prevent the growth of organizations such as ISIS/ISIL (he even stated, the spoils go to the victor) but that's preventative measures and was an anecdotal example.


* First, it was a memorandum, which isn't an interpretation of the law (that's what an executive order is), but a policy regarding the DAPL. If you read the memorandum, it asks for the USACE to review 5 key areas that are potentially holding the completion of the pipeline. 


- Not only is (and was) this wrong, but the DAPL has been moved another 25 miles away from the area that was under contention, which was noted as above and beyond the distance to ensure that the water basin will ever be affected by the pipeline. The DAPL doesn't violate property rights, it never did. You are working with the twisted position of those that are wholly against the transportation of oil based on an ideological position. 


* This is bordering on equivocation, either you mean he will be the biggest supporter of the military America has ever seen, or he will create the biggest military America has ever seen. If you mean the first, it's one of the main tenets of his campaign and coming from a man that spits out hyperbole like it's going to bankrupt CNN, is not surprising. If you are implying the second, no, not only is he an anti-war president, but the house is in control of the military budget and Congress has to repeal sequestration. The president can advocate for military support, but it's Congress that holds that power. 


* It's impossible to put Trumps businesses in a blind trust because of name recognition and how large his business empire is. He has stepped away from the company, leaving two of his children in charge and donates all of the money any foreign government spends at any Trump company to the federal government. 


* The country Saudi Arabia is not responsible for 9/11, don't conflate the issue. Also, "Keeping close ties"... His companies, which he has stepped away from, have hotels and large businesses all over the world. He has already stepped away from his companies in order to make it clear he doesn't have a conflict of interest. They aren't ties, Him having a chain of hotels isn't some collusion. 


* So let's be clear, his kid is finishing this school year, so about 5 months. Second, this is extremely misleading. You are right, it costs New York and the government a LOT of money to protect the first family, however, due to multiple members of the first family living in Manhattan, the cost of protecting the entire family is egregious, the cost of having Melania and Barron stay in Manhattan won't increase it that much (I don't have actual figures, I know it will increase it ofc). 


* Did you notice how those charges all came about at the same time, almost like creating a narrative that combines with the "grab em by the pussy" tape to make Trump appear to be a rapist? You may have also noted that the three lawsuits that were filed were dropped/dismissed and the "controversy" has suddenly disappeared. If Trump had indeed assaulted these women or violated the NAP, I'll join you and others in the impeachment process, but the truth is, these stories were made up to disparage a presidential candidate. 


* He has also stated multiple times that politics is a pay to play system and that as a businessman in New York, he worked with her. Also, prior to running for president, Trump was seen as much more of a centrist, he was even a potential candidate under a third party in the early 2000's. It's not surprising to anyone that the political elite know each other.
* Let's be clear, Trump uses a lot of hyperbole, he says shit like he's going to be the greatest X or build the best Y; he often says something ridiculous so that when the media goes to correct him, they aim for centrist positions instead of sticking to their typical diametric leaning hyperbole. The dichotomy of Trump to the media is so ridiculous that he's never going to be favorable with them. Juxtapose Trump to Obama and there's a very different narrative. Obama was so favored by the media that it was practically patronizing to the public. I like that he challenges news organizations, I wish that he didn't have to be so egregious in statements, but if that is what it takes to avoid the "drive-by media tactics" then so be it.

I'm not seeing they aren't anarchists, I'm saying their actions were independent of their label as an anarchist. I suppose if this is a specific group that you are identifying as the anarchist group, I understand, but tying their actions to the term anarchy disparages that ideology
