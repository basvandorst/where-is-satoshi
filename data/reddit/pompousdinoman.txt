More like segwit isn't finished yet. It's not supported by the core wallet and half the wallets that support it have issues with not being able to send or receive with segwit addresses because they use a different address protocol than other segwit addresses. It's a shit show and they're aimed at casual users who just want a simple experience.

Personal attacks as a sidenote are not the same thing as personal attacks as an argument. I am not saying he is dumb in order to discredit him and his argument. I am saying he is dumb, and then explaining why he is wrong regardless of him being dumb or not. Remove the first and last sentence of my post and the argument stands alone just fine.
The other user, on the other hand, integrates personal attacks into the argument as support for it. He says that I *must* work for coinbase to disagree with him. Then calls them a POS company, which would be fine were he to have explained why. But he doesn't,  he just throws more attacks based off of them being a piece of shit, accusing them of self sabotage, collusion, and poor time management, but not explaining why other than calling them a POS. Try to remove the insults from that comment and read it as a normal argument. You can't even do it because every sentence is embedded with condescension.

Bittrex, but I just found out it only works in certain states, so check here  to see if you're state is restricted. Also verify your account before you put any funds in so you can withdraw.
People seem to like Bitfinex, but I haven't tried it. Sort of sketchy to me, with not verifying and being behind tether, but none of them are perfect. Do not use poloniex, lots of bad stories with them. HitBTC works, but it's weirdly slow on my laptop, which might not be a problem that many people have.
Also if you start trading diversify. Always keep some BTC, and a little LTC and ETH. Trading alts is risky but the returns can be unbelievable.

People are whiny little babies when there's any kind of problem with their money. Coinbase is fine, it slows down sometimes when there is very high volume. Bittrex is also fine, people just don't read the agreement and don't realize you have to get verified before you can withdraw. It took me ten minutes to do.
I don't know why you'd use an app at all instead of a website. I guess you can use it anywhere which could be important. Coinbase is by far the most reliable and trustworthy exchange, and the only one I know to have an app. If you link it with a GDAX account you can buy and sell with a much lower fee too. This subreddit deletes a lot of technical discussion because it doesn't like people questioning certain ideas. So a lot of the technical discussion including what you asked for happens elsewhere.

The people who don't care enough to adopt it are the core developers. It's not usable using the core wallet. You can't expect everyone else to be faster than the people who make the reference client.
Increasing block size doesn't slow down second layer development and adoption.
If 2nd layer solutions fix everything then there won't even need to be a block size limit, the blocks just wouldn't need need to be as big, like before the block size hit the limit when there were no fees.

Not the part about loans though, if you have low interest rates you can make some safe investments and make more money than you'd save paying the loan off early.

Yeah, more people mining bch would make the difficulty go down which would help bitcoin get more miners.

Being trustless is one of the central pillars of bitcoin's value proposition. Forks are what is supposed to happen when people disagree. If you want consensus use USD. Bitcoin is the embodiment of disagreement.

The fork is also a great invention. Some countries still use chopsticks because those got there first.
Ok, you agree with the first solution thing.
I agree with everything you said. That **or** statement you made is the key. Whether something is seen as an improvement or something new. It's also important to get it right the first time, but also to be the first one to get it right.
Number 3 I think of as including the alternative solutions. The stages represent how people see the problems, and what kind of people try to fix them. It's more of a psychological system than whatever other kind of system. Some people want to do something no one else has done, some people do something that's been done but for which standard methods are not established, and some people want to work in a tried and tested system where everything is known, and the goal is to master the system. And some people just kind of live explore stuff verbally and mentally but aren't interested in really doing something about it.
Also thanks for the book suggestion, I'll check it out.

It is objectively faster and cheaper without using off chain transaction. Hedging is always at the cost of something better. That's what hedging is.

What if a large team of capable developers wasn't necessary? If there was a simple solution that erased the need for them? As Fred Brooks said, "What one programmer can do in one month, two programmers can do in two months."
@_date: 2017-11-24 07:12:41
The quality of a solution is directly related to time at which it's evaluated. Over time, better solutions become available, so every existing solution becomes relatively worse over time. Every solution has a lifespan before a better solution is brought forth. I don't think that quality and time can quite be separated because of that.
I'm a little sad that venmo exists now, and so do apple pay and android pay. I was hoping bitcoin would do what they're doing. That's where it seemed like it was going when I first learned about it. It wasn't a replacement for cash or credit. It was gonna do something nothing else could do.
I believe there is a cycle1.  of:
1. Need for solution
1. First rough solution
1. Refining solution
1. Maintaining solution
So it all works out as all are necessary. I expected bitcoin to start at 2, though it now seems to be 3 and only improving what fiat based systems do. It will still serve as 2 for certain things, but not as many as many had hoped.
I hope this has made sense. It is awfully late.

Everyone who had savings in bitcoin before the fork has the same amount in BCH now.
Also bitcoin is an extremely volatile investment. You shouldn't invest your savings in it if you aren't willing to lose them.
@_date: 2017-11-24 03:57:28
Especially when the other coin is someone trying to make bitcoin better. It's not even an alt. It's a fork. Bitcoin is an experiment, and every added feature is another experiment on top of that. Now it has a control group not adding those features to compare it to. That's good science and it holds developers accountable to actually make it better than it was without those features. The people claiming an attack are the same as the people claiming bitcoin is an attack on fiat. Adapt or die.

The definite truth is that you don't know which of the 'eithers' will happen. The point of hedging is that you don't have as much risk whichever one happens.

Fear and uncertainty is the reality of this and every other situation. Rejecting them is rejecting reality and making yourself powerless. Bitcoin is not finished, it is not perfect, and it has competition. This is the reality of Bitcoin. Reality cannot be bad or good for Bitcoin. Bitcoin can only be bad or good at functioning in reality. Once you accept that Bitcoin is not an organized nationwide rollout of a finished product with a PR team to make it look spotless and perfect to users, you see that the only thing you have control over is whether Bitcoin is better or worse than other currencies. And this is the only thing that will affect how successful it is. Brand is only useful as a signaling device for improvement.
The entire point of bitcoin is to create competition between currencies to force improvement. It is contentious. It's forking the whole idea of what currency is. You accept that Bitcoin is a controversial improvement over fiat currency. You cannot then reject the possibility of a controversial improvement over Bitcoin currency. It doesn't matter whether you think something is ok or not. The only way to remove contention is to make Bitcoin a superior currency.

Are you familiar with the stages of a bubble?

Whatever you do, don't go to is heavily censored and only allows positive discussion of one coin, and often bans people who are simply curious for asking technical questions because on you are not allowed to question certain things. Luckily another sub was created to be censorship free and allow all opinions to be discussed, while the first one's front page is just people who don't understand anything technical making memes about the price going up ;)  Do you understand what's so bad about If you do, you know why you shouldn't click on a link to @_date: 2017-11-22 22:21:16

And their coin's price is 6x higher than it was a month ago. The combined market cap is up 60% from a month ago. That's $60,000,000,000 more dollars in added value. It's not a zero sum game. They don't want or need bitcoin to fail when there is plenty of money coming in from the outside. They actually help each other because when bitcoin gets too congested, more people use bch, which lowers the load on btc. Having two block chains means neither has to record all the transactions. The equilibrium has both being used, not one dominating the other.
@_date: 2017-11-24 03:44:01
If bch overtook bitcoin it would just be bitcoin. You sound like a cultist when you say "It's just impossible." You even capitalized the" I" like it's some mantra. Everything you're saying just sounds like people using paper currency saying it will never be dethroned by bitcoin.

So both coins are growing in value, the combined market cap is up $60,000,000,000 since last month when this all started with accusations of pumping, doesn't it kind of seem like a non-zero sum game at this point? Since we know the sum is 60 billion instead of zero?

Currently Bitcoin Cash is closing the gap with Bitcoin Core because it offers an immediate improvement. Donald Trump was just elected president because he offered immediate solutions to problems that others offered long term solutions to. Books increase knowledge and happiness while social media provides the opposite, yet social media is gaining in popularity while books are waning because social media is instant. Rainforests are being cut down because it lets poor people make money even though it would be more profitable long term to let them survive. That one guy tried to cut open his golden goose.

The ideal purpose is to take money out of the economy during growth stages and put it back into the economy during recessions so we never have a really bad economy. Deflation is cool until there is no point investing in anything because you're already making money just holding it, and then your economy slows way down. And then it's really not cool if you're in debt because your debt is growing in value. Over time, the amount of money being spent is decreasing, and the amount held stays the same, so no one wants to take out loans and start a company because they're very difficult to pay back.

Whatever provides the most improvement is the best option. Having more brains make more solutions than necessary does not help. If you have one problem with one simple answer and you ask ten people to fix it, you're going to get ten complicated solutions as each of them tries to make themselves necessary.
You say that the time is takes to get things done should not trump the quality of the results. This has nothing to do with reality. In reality time matters. The best way to cross an ocean is using an airplane. Before they had airplanes, they didn't decide to build airplanes in order to cross the ocean, they just used ships. If your solution takes a long time to design and implement, you must be prepared to wait a long time for it to be recognized as the better solution. If someone has a solution that is an immediate improvement, it will be used and adopted. When your solution is ready, it will be used and adopted, if it is an improvement. In the mean time people might invest in your solution, but you cannot expect everyone to not use the immediate solution just because yours is eventually going to get there.

I agree. I also think the cycle would balance out over time like a population growth curve bouncing around equilibrium. It's a kind of harmony that a blunt tool like the government can't help.
