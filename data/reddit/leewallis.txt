Nice update!
How come you guys changed from "next generation Bitcoin exchange" to "next generation digital asset exchange"?
@_date: 2018-01-29 09:43:56
I really doubt that.
@_date: 2018-01-08 21:57:29
That's great. However, as long as people are still using Coinbase, they need to be optimising their transactions to help the network.

Yeah you're right, I just have to worry about centralization and less security. Hmmmm... Nah I think I'll stick to the biggest, most secure network and pay the appropriate fees thanks.

How 420,000 might be bitcoin’s magic number
April 20, 2016
28th November 2012 was a slow news day. There was a lunar eclipse -- the second that year -- and it was the first day since 1990 that the NYPD reported that no one was shot, stabbed or slashed in New York.  There wasn’t much to report. And while journalists around the World searched for a scoop one small story went uncovered – the reward for mining a block on the bitcoin blockchain had just halved.
 Commencing in January 9th 2009 when the Bitcoin blockchain initiated, each and every one of the 209,999 blocks mined, created at a rate of approximately one every ten minutes, in an uninterrupted 24/7/365 operation, had attracted a new, autonomous creation by the network itself of 50 new, never before seen, bitcoin.
 A lot had changed since 2009. The first block mined had 1 transaction (the special “coinbase” transaction that captures the reward) and no other activity. By 2012 the network size and activity had grown significantly and there were 543 transactions in the “pre-halving” block.
 The next block mined, at a height of precisely 210,000 blocks, as codified years earlier by Satoshi Nakamoto, had a 25 bitcoin reward.
 So what?
 Nothing much happened. However, a few months later the value of a bitcoin had increased dramatically. Prices had been steadily increasing as the halving approached, they ended 2011 at $7, and rose to $11 by September, 2012.
 The high tick by April 2013 was $259.
 Needless to say bitcoin has demonstrated stomach-churning volatility in the past and this meteoric rise met with considerable turbulence. None of this may in fact have had anything to do with the halving, it’s impossible to determine that one way or the other. But even so, there had certainly been an extraordinary chance to profit.
 So now we look forward to the next pre-ordained halving, at a block height of precisely 420,000. We sit at 408,138 at the time of writing, with the next halving expected on or around 11th July 2016. At that moment the 25 coin per block reward halves again, to 12.5
 It is interesting to think about whether we will see another price rise following this next event. I’m confident that there won’t be fireworks on the day itself, and indeed there is some prospect that prices will rise in advance of the event, fully discounting the effect ahead of time. I don’t see that happening currently.
 At this moment the value of all bitcoin in circulation is $6.7 billion. At the old rate of issuance, that puts $575m of new coin in circulation per year. Prices so far in 2016 have been relatively stable. That tells me that there is enough new investment and real time demand to match the creation of $575m new coin. It seems obvious that if that dollar-sized demand persists, which I believe it will, that the price of bitcoin must rise to meet it.
 Naysayers and haters will say -- in addition to the normal criticism of bitcoin -- that a drop of $288m per year in supply is not meaningful when compared to the $6.7 billion inventory.
 That’s not how commodities work.
 Just think about what happened recently in the oil market. Taking the USA alone we now have more oil and refined products in inventory than since records began, over 2 billion barrels. Yet the price of oil has risen 60% from the $25 low point early in the year.
 OPEC has hinted that the oil production introduced to the market will no longer rise. This will do very little indeed to change the inventory picture. It will remain engorged. So why the massive rally?
 Because commodities price on the rate of change of inventory, not on inventory.
 When bitcoin dipped in price in June 2015 I stated passionately prices couldn’t remain in the 200’s 
 I’m equally convinced that today, a price of $440 is, once again,  too low.
@_date: 2018-01-29 07:17:45
Ok, if what you’re saying is true than that answers my queries.
@_date: 2018-01-15 22:15:25
I’m assuming he means because everyone holds value in fiat, which is under the full control of governments, so swapping fiat for bitcoin is literally taking value from the wrong people and putting it into the hands of the hodler.
@_date: 2018-01-07 07:26:01
Well said.

@_date: 2018-01-04 06:30:15
Sure, theoretically if everyone agreed, we could increase the number of coins available on the bitcoin network. But you would have to get everyone to agree to devalue their coin holdings by allowing the supply to be increased for it to actually happen. Good luck trying to convince everyone in the world to agree on losing money.

All the risks of a centralized point of failure don’t exist in lightning. No one can control or take your money. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:19:59
It looks like a good solution. But because this transaction was sent from my Blockchain.info wallet, I don't have access to the private key to be able to sign a new transaction. Do you know a way to get my private key from my Blockchain.info wallet?
@_date: 2018-01-07 10:04:58
That’s ok. I don’t expect everyone to sign. Just enough to get a response from Coinbase on the matter will make it all worth doing. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 04:48:25
They consider SegWit to not be in the next 5 priorities that their customers want. Let's show them that it should be.
@_date: 2018-01-05 07:22:17
Yes, we should stop using them. But that doesn’t mean we should stop asking. What about the thousands of new users who join Coinbase everyday? They don’t know what any of this means.
@_date: 2018-01-07 08:12:00
Yep, so there’s plenty of people left to sign.
@_date: 2018-01-07 09:55:16
Absolutely! 1,000 isn’t my end goal, it’s the first milestone of many.
@_date: 2018-01-25 10:33:36
I’m actually ashamed I let that through, I’m English.
@_date: 2018-01-29 07:14:18
Ok cool, thanks for clearing that up. How are these exchanges confident that Tether is backed 1 for 1? Seems strange for exchanges to be trusting an entity without proof, especially in this industry.
@_date: 2018-01-07 07:20:18
They are under the impression that their customers don’t care about SegWit. Brian Armstrong made that clear on Bloomberg. So I figure I can show him that it’s not the case.
Yes of course we can go to another service, I already have, but this doesn’t help all the new users joining Coinbase every day. They will have high fees and a bad experience because of Coinbase, but they will blame bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:17:55
Unfortunately not.
The first solution was to send the same or a higher amount from the same address but with a higher fee that would cover both transactions, but I don't have enough funds (I sent 1.6 BTC).
The second solution was a "Child Pays for Parent" solution, but that involves [using a page that doesn't exist anymore]( and it also involves signing a transaction from the same address. However, the transaction was sent from my Blockchain.info wallet address, which I don't think gives me access to my private key, so I can't sign a transaction outside of the Blockchain.info interface. Unless someone knows how to get my private key from this Blockchain.info wallet?
@_date: 2018-01-12 10:11:53
That’s not the goal. It’s a moving target.

@_date: 2018-01-09 11:40:18
If he understood his customers, he would understand the importance of implementing SegWit. A small vocal minority doesn’t mean the silent ones don’t want the same thing. Who the fuck doesn’t want cheaper fees? You’re talking out of your arse. There is no defense for dragging their feet on this. They are simply acting out of their own self interests, not their customers who got them to where they are in the first place.
@_date: 2018-01-11 11:51:36
This makes a lot of sense, thanks so much. Really appreciate you taking the time to explain.

Because, as far as I’m aware, Bitfenix promise the USD equivalent of Tether is in their holdings, making it a legitimate Tether. If it turns out not to be the case, there will be a lot of people exiting the market.
I could be wrong, this is why I’m asking.
See this article:

@_date: 2018-01-07 22:46:10
It’s more like Coinbase resemble the little kids and the parents are asking them to cut their shit out and do the right thing.
@_date: 2018-01-05 06:43:03
They would implement if we could prove there’s demand from their customers for it, because they would need to even just to save face.
Using a different service is fine but doesn’t help the new users creating accounts every day who have no idea what segwit is.
@_date: 2018-01-12 12:36:00

The transaction fee is worth it to keep monetary value out of the hands or control of anyone but yourself. Perhaps that will be it’s only use until lightning is rolled out and widespread, but that’s still one of the most valuable uses ever known to man. I’m happy to wait for scaling. If you’re not, take your pick from 1200+ alternatives. You’re spoilt for choice.
@_date: 2018-01-10 09:06:01
Damn, does it have to be the same or higher? I sent like 1.6 BTC, and I don’t have another 1.6 to send. What would happen if I sent a low amount 0.01 but included a high fee? 
@_date: 2018-01-05 07:23:20
Thanks. I feel like trying is better than not trying. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 01:59:41
Because it is one of the rules of the system which cannot be changed. Every 4 years the bitcoin reward given to miners will halve. In roughly 100 years all 21 million will be mined and no more will be released.
@_date: 2018-01-05 08:08:58
I’m not doing this for me. I already understand what segwit is and which services have implemented it. I’m doing this for new users who sign up to Coinbase every day who don’t understand and can’t ask for this upgrade.

TIL bank transfers can be reversed? 
I’m not sure this is accurate. I was under the impression this was only for credit cards.
If it wasn’t, why wouldn’t all exchanges allow credit card purchases if it carries the same risk as bank transfers?

I’m confused why this is being downvoted. Surely upvoting and giving a response would be much more useful at addressing concerns?
I’m interested to know if this article holds any substance and I’m sure others are too.

Yeah, fully aware. We won’t be stopping at 1k, that’s just the first target.
@_date: 2018-01-11 07:16:49


You’re a fucking douche. This is exactly what I’m talking about.
People could help with one upvote, so that the question gets more exposure and someone who does want to help may just do that, but you’d rather downvote it because you feel like the solution is already on the web somewhere and it’s my problem if I can’t find it or understand it.
Thanks for your help.
P.S. For the record, I was using blockchain.info as my hot wallet, and the funds I was storing were minimal, it’s only recently the price has skyrocketed so I realized I’m no longer holding a few hundred dollars but $15-$20k. The irony is the transaction I made was to move this to cold storage, so why don’t you lay off the lecture. Either be helpful or keep shit to yourself.
@_date: 2018-01-11 07:30:12

@_date: 2017-12-01 07:32:04
It’s a complicated question because it’s so unlike anything we’ve seen before.
I like to compare it to gold. Let’s break down the properties of gold.
Fungibility - High
Portability - Moderate
Durability - High
Highly Divisible - Moderate
Secure (can’t be counterfeit) - Moderate
Easily Transactable -  Low
Scarce - Moderate
Gold has a $7-$8 trillion dollar market, and is considered one of the best ways to store value around the world.
Let’s look at Bitcoin.
Fungibility - High
Portability - High
Durability - High
Highly Divisible - High
Secure (can’t be counterfeit) - High
Easily Transactable -  High
Scarce - High
You can move any fraction of bitcoin around the world in seconds, without anyone’s permission, without the use of a bank, and without having to physically move any object.
In addition, its:
- Not issued by a government
- Completely decentralized 
- Programmable 
It cannot be seized by anyone, unlike gold. You can store bitcoin as a memory and take it with you anywhere, unlike gold. You can store the same value in multiple locations, unlike gold. You don’t need to spend a lot of money to move it, unlike gold. The ledger of all transactions is public and accessible by anyone, unlike gold. There will only ever be 21M bitcoins, yet we can mine for more gold. Anyone in any country can buy/sell or send/receive bitcoin, unlike gold. 
When you look at it like this, it makes a very strong case for bitcoin being Gold 2.0. Why would you buy gold when you can store wealth digitally? 
Currently bitcoin is a $0.17 trillion market, compared to golds $8 trillion. So with some simple math we could work out that if more wealth was stored with bitcoin, the price of each unit will increase in value because of the limited supply.
For example,  if 5% of the gold market moved to bitcoin, that would make bitcoin a $400 billion market. Currently there are only 17,000,000 bitcoins, so $400B divided by 17M put the price per bitcoin at $23,529. 
Is it reasonable to think bitcoin could one day be a trillion dollar market? Sure it is.
Well 1 trillion divided by 17M would put the price per unit at $47,619.
So the question is, will people trust bitcoin and crypto currency to store their wealth better than alternatives? Well, they already are.
And we haven’t even touched on bitcoins utility yet and all the industries it can disrupt. This is just talking about one use (store of value).

I think I understand what you’re saying, but why would that matter? Couldn’t there be many channels to route your payment to the receiver? I.e. if you didn’t want to use a hub or if the hub stopped you from using their channel (If that’s even possible) couldn’t you route your payment through other channels/hubs?

@_date: 2017-12-31 04:30:55


This is incorrect. From my understanding, this is only the case if you spend bitcoin for the purchase (i.e. if the merchant accepts bitcoin from you for the purchase). If you convert your bitcoin to dollars before making the purchase you will trigger a capital gains event, even if the value is under $10,000.
I’d be very careful as you’re currently unknowingly tax dodging.

Hey, thanks for your take on this... this was something I thought long and hard about.
I decided that I wanted to make it a personal business/website because my main angle to market is the fact that I used to be the creative lead in many of these big marketing agencies, and the clients would be charged a fortune for the project to literally just be dropped on my desk. So I figured, why not give clients the opportunity to go direct to the person whose responsible for producing this type of work within the "big fancy agencies", without the middle-man in between taking a huge cut for passing the project down the pipeline.
My goal is for clients to come to me because they're tired of dealing with 5 different people in a marketing agency and never get to talk to the big boss or get the attention they deserve for the premium price they pay.
I do agree with your advice though, just not in this specific case because of how I'm going to market.
Thanks again for taking the time!

Yeah, they're known as "copydoodles" and they've been proven to increase conversion by forcing the user to look at the elements of the page that you want to focus on. However, for my site I've just used them more for fun.
Usually I'd use them to point out that a product is free, or that there's something available for a limited time etc..

If I only got paid in Bitcoin from every client, that would be a great time to live in! The likelihood is that if every client pays me in Bitcoin, we'd be living in a time when my landlord will take Bitcoin anyway.
Until then, I just use my AUD clients to pay the rent :)

Serious question...
How do you spend Bitcoin if it were on an app like this (I.e. No ability to scan a QR code as you're holding the device you need to scan it).
I'm assuming the only way is copy/paste the address from this app to your Bitcoin wallet app? 
Can someone clarify?
@_date: 2015-06-25 05:12:12
2.99% + $2.99 per transaction? Surely not.
@_date: 2015-06-25 05:16:18
Nope, I just hold the Bitcoin and use it to buy every day things when I get the opportunity. The money that pays the rent is from clients who don't pay in Bitcoin.
Hopefully when I convince my landlord to accept Bitcoin it won't matter, but until then I hold it and spend it where I can.
I also have a CoinJar Swipe card for every day groceries.
@_date: 2015-06-25 05:20:19
Will do, thanks for the feedback!
@_date: 2015-06-24 23:50:55
Thanks for your kind words, really appreciate it!
@_date: 2015-06-24 23:45:47
Hey, thanks for the feedback. 
There are some valid points that I don't go into too much detail about what I do on the main site, so it can look like I just create website visuals which certainly isn't the case. 
I haven't started advertising yet as I've already got some clients from word of mouth, but when I do start advertising with a regular budget, traffic won't be sent to my homepage. They'll be sent to a specific landing page which is designed and targeted around the service and demographic I'm advertising at that time.
I hope that makes sense?
For the reference of everyone here, here's a quick list of what I do:
* Create website and landing page designs (always custom made, never using templates)
* Convert these designs into functioning websites, either by custom coding from scratch, or using Wordpress or Drupal as a base and building on top of them.
* Integrate these websites with CRM software or Email marketing services to manage new subscribers and leads (such as iContact, GetResponse, Infusionsoft, Ontraport, Salesforce etc)
* Direct response copywriting for websites, email auto responders, marketing materials, adverts etc.
* The setup and ongoing management of Google AdWords and Facebook Ads pay-per-click services.
* The ongoing optimization of these websites and advertising materials by way of split testing.
* The setup of email marketing broadcasts and autoresponder messages for new and current subscribers.
* Design and copywrite a "lead magnet" such as a free downloadable guide to offer visitors in exchange for their email address, or a free video/audio of the same.
In a nutshell, my job is to create a website that has a constant stream of visitors (from Google/Facebook) that automatically converts as many of them as possible to subscribers, then using email marketing and freemium content to conver these subscribers into hot leads who are begging to buy your products or services. Then I optimise your ads, website and marketing funnel to lower your cost per customer acquisition.
Hope that helps!

I 100% agree that for the average person to start experimenting with Bitcoin, they need to see it denominated in bits.
Every friend who I explain Bitcoin to always says the same thing "I'd buy some but it's too expensive!".
Also notice how when you ChangeTip a newbie and it says ".. has sent you 1,000 bits ($0.33)" it makes complete sense. Rather then ".. has sent you 0.0009941 BTC ($0.33)" is much more confusing.
Just my opinion...
@_date: 2014-05-19 22:15:32
This may well be true, but unlike the way he was doing it before, the more awareness Bitcoin gets in his country, the more of a market there will be, and the more the pricing will be in line. 
The alternative is paying high fees forever. Still a no-brainer to switch.

I totally agree bits is the way to go for mass adoption.
If you're looking to purchase Bitcoin as a store of value (commodity), then the price should be shown as:
**BTC = $400**
Gold = $1,212
Silver = $17.55
If you're looking to purchase Bitcoin to spend every day (currency), then the price should be shown as:
**1,000 Bits = 0.40 USD**
1 AUD = 0.89 USD
1 GBP = 1.63 USD
Just my two cents/bits.

There's a Bitcoin link in the top right navigation which goes to Bitcoin.org ?
@_date: 2014-12-16 02:36:51
It pretty much is a direct copy of Million Dollar Homepage, with some variations and a different angle.
1. It's targeted at bitcoin owners, not just random businesses who want to advertise.
2. It's a fixed tile size (30x30) and you can only purchase one, not as many pixels as you like.
3. It displays a photo of the user, their story, their bitcoin address for tips, a website URL and their country. Not just an advert and a link.
4. It's MUCH cheaper. It works out at $0.03 per pixel, not $1 per pixel.
Me believing in bitcoin has nothing to do with the price. I'm trying to raise money, so I wanted to do something which I thought was both interesting and had the potential to raise money.
Plus, it's all about the headline if you want the media attention. The reason the million dollar homepage became famous is because of the money he managed to raise from it, not because of the project itself. Had he charged nothing, there would have been no story, and therefore no attention. 
The fact that he made it into the media created a surge in traffic which in turn made it worth the investment of those companies involved.
@_date: 2014-05-26 04:05:24
Looks good, are you currently putting your own money into Bitcoin then?
@_date: 2014-11-24 08:36:54
Bitcoin can be broken down into tiny amounts, even less than a penny.
Most people use "bits" as the main unit. 1 Bitcoin = 1,000,000 bits. So a $2.50 coffee would be about 6,000 bits at today's rate.
@_date: 2014-06-19 23:02:25
That is NOT proof that this guy owns that website.
Why would someone with the intelligence to set up a website like that whose details are stored with Google (for advertising) start posting on a forum asking for Bitcoin payments for "protection".

This is actually much better in my opinion...
Look at Circle, slowly inviting more and more people until they're fully ready, imagine when they finally open the doors to everyone worldwide.

You're missing the point... The problem is having to charge GST twice.
Companies sell an item for $100+GST ($110 total) which the customer then pays in Bitcoin, the company then wants to convert that Bitcoin into $110, but now they have to add GST to that sale of $110, effectively paying GST twice.

When Bitcoin usage is as simple as logging on to a website with a username and password (just like you would for online banking), and selecting a contact to send money to, whether thats by using their email address, phone number or a username, thats when mass adoption will occur...
And Circle has almost hit the nail on the head with this.
@_date: 2014-12-16 02:42:34
Assuming that every single person who holds Bitcoin has purchased an item from Overstock...

@_date: 2014-08-25 03:26:31
I do agree that Bitcoin needs to be spent in large amounts every day and consistently, not just one off surges. However, to get to that level, we need more consumers to know about and spend Bitcoin and more merchants to know about and accept Bitcoin, and this seems like a way of doing that where everybody wins.
@_date: 2014-12-17 04:24:24

This is BS. Here's the REAL reply I got:
Hello, 
I understand your concern. 
We don't accept Bitcoin as a payment method on our website at this time. We accept credit cards, debit cards, payment from U.S. checking accounts, Amazon.com Gift Cards, Amazon Payments Stored Balance, and the Amazon.com Store Card. Here are the credit cards we accept: 
-- American Express 
-- Diner's Club (U.S. billing addresses only) 
-- Discover 
-- MasterCard 
-- Visa, Visa Electron, and Visa Check Cards 
-- Eurocard 
-- JCB 
-- NYCE 
-- STAR 
-- China UnionPay (credit card only) 
I have passed your suggestion to the appropriate department in our company. It is always important for us to hear how customers react to all aspects of shopping at Amazon.com. Strong customer feedback like yours helps us continue to improve the selection and service we provide, and we appreciate the time you took to write to us. 
I'd also like to inform you that we have received the same suggestion from many of our valued customers like you and our team has already considered it as a scope of improvement and working for better results. 
We hope to see you again soon.
Best regards,
Nithya G.

How difficult will it be for someone to confirm a transaction when the 21 million bitcoins are mined, and roughly how much will they receive for this?
I worry about the incentive of confirming transactions being too small to keep miners doing it once the fees are tiny.

Thanks for your reply.
I did have the same thought about email, however isn't there a big difference in that email was a huge improvement on the postal mail service and had an immediate and obvious reason for people to try the alternative? (i.e. don't have to go to post office, don't have to pay anything, message arrives instantly no matter where in the world).
Bitcoin is a huge improvement on money, but it isn't as obvious as to why you should use it, not for every day spending anyway, which is what I'm talking about. 
Bitcoin has the same obvious benefits over banks as email does over postal mail, but only when talking about sending money using the Bitcoin protocol. (i.e. don't have to deal with a third party, don't have to pay any fees, money arrives instantly no matter where in the world).
I do agree however that Bitcoin adoption is a process, and we still are in the very early stages. I just have a strong feeling that it may only be used as a protocol for sending money worldwide, rather than as an every day currency to buy your milk and eggs. I do really hope I'm wrong though.

Ok, so I followed the instructions of this reddit post and the end result was me being even more convinced that Bitcoin and the Blockchain are worth more than gold in value. Sorry about that
@_date: 2014-12-05 06:42:13
Totally agree... like I've said before, the huge advantage with bitcoin is that YOU can switch between being centralized/decentralized whenever you like.
It's perfect that newbies can sign up for a coinbase/circle account as simply as they would create a facebook account and play with bitcoin, then when they become more educated about managing their own wallets they can easily make the decision to remove themselves from these services but continue to use bitcoin.
It's crucial to have both options in my opinion.
@_date: 2014-05-23 06:08:54
I do like using the Blockchain Wallet via safari on my iPhone, the only downside is the QR scanner doesn't work.
@_date: 2014-12-11 05:10:10

Circle were definitely a nice change when they launched and I went from waiting 3-4 days to purchase bitcoin to under 10 seconds.
All I need them to do now is allow Australian bank accounts to be linked. Then I'm their number 1 fan.

Most hotels I've stayed in have authorised my card upfront for a deposit amount and then released the amount back to my card after 5 business days. With BTC maybe they could simply charge you the amount in BTC and refund you instantly on checkout?

Why can't Bitcoin do both?
If you want to use a centralized service because it provides convenience and ease of use, use it. 
If you don't, store your bitcoin yourself and don't use any centralized services.
Why does it have to be one or the other?
At the end of the day, without these centralized companies making it easier for people to get started, the average person wont adopt bitcoin. Simple as that.
The huge benefit is that you can freely switch between centralized/decentralized use.

What makes you think this guy is the actual owner of FastestCoins.com ?
I could post the exact same message and instead put my Bitcoin address.
He asks you to email him a receipt at that email address, probably as another way to make you believe its his site.
However, what would it matter if he never received the receipts? He'll already have your coins, and everyone is chasing the owner of that domain.
He's clearly just trying to blag everyone on LocalBitcoins... I think he's full of shit.

3. I wonder if they're on the Bitcoin bandwagon yet?
4. Remembered a Shazam ad is seen.
5. Thought "why don't they allow Bitcoin donations through the screen"?
6. Il post this idea on reddit and see what the community thinks.
Thanks for trying to make me feel bad though
@_date: 2014-05-20 13:57:49
Sounds like a good idea to me... not sure how many people would donate.

Play "Bit Relay" - have a contest with 20 people (10 in each group stood in 2 lines) and start the first person in each group with 1000 bits (or other tiny amount). The first person then has to transfer the 1000 bits (minus 100 bits that they keep) to the next person in their group and so on until it reaches the last person and they all have 100 bits each. Whichever group does it quickest gets an additional share of a bigger prize fund which you then distribute to each. The losing team walks away with 100 bits each.
Would be a thrill to play, would also demonstrate the speed of transactions and give the two groups some bits to play with.
P.s. I just made this up so I may have forgotten some obvious reason why this wouldn't work... But that's the concept. 
@_date: 2014-08-20 13:20:51
Yep if you do it yourself or if you use an Aussie payment processor like CoinJar.
Using BitPay is fine, but it's not exactly a long term solution to the key issue here. Aussie Bitcoin exchanges/payment processors are pretty screwed.
Plus, like moral_agent said... As a consumer in Aussie, I'd have to pay GST on Bitcoin that I buy, then GST on the items I buy with the Bitcoin I've already paid GST on.

Oh edward, don't be so touchy, I don't care THAT much. I was just a little annoyed that they announced international bitcoin acceptance as of 1st Sept, so I purposely bought some more Bitcoin ready to spend on their website (to support THEM) as all my BTC is in cold storage, and they're holding me up.
I literally don't even want to buy anything from Overstock, I just wanted to show my support (see my post from 2 weeks ago: 
So it's just ironic that they are delaying me from showing my support by spending money I wouldn't have otherwise spent.

I did prefer electrum to begin with, but I couldn't work out how to create a paper wallet from electrum.

@_date: 2014-05-03 13:03:34
That looks like a great step towards solving this problem. So I guess rather than the person at the till swiping your credit card and handing over an EFTPOS device for you to enter your pin, it would basically just be a USB cable that you plug your wallet into and confirm the transaction.
Pretty awesome stuff.
What id personally find freaking awesome is if you could scan your thumbprint on their point of sale device which matches your thumbprint to your wallet, and then you enter a PIN number to confirm the transaction. Only issue with this would be privacy, your wallet would match to a thumbprint and you lose the anonymity.
How easy would that be though! It would be very smooth and easy. No device or paper wallet required (except if you have no thumbs!)

Ah yes I saw a demo of this a week back, very impressive UI. Only thing you have to prove now is that you're absolutely 1000000% secure and no one will ever lose any funds if they keep them in your wallet, then you'll be huge. 
But how you'll prove that I have no idea, thats the big issue at the moment I guess.

Hey, the easiest way I can explain the site is as a mix of [Million Dollar Homepage]( and [Humans of New York](
The main purpose is to break the stereotype that Bitcoin is only used by cyber-criminals by showing the real faces and stories behind 1,000 everyday Bitcoin advocates.
Yes I'm trying to raise money for myself whilst doing this, I'm being very open and honest for my reasons. However a portion of the funds will also be used to hopefully publish a book of the participants involved in the project.

I appreciate your opinion, however I'd much rather live a riskier life with the chance (however small it may be) of making a fortune and living a better quality of life, then to spend my life on the safe side and living a mediocre life. That's just me, that's my choice.


Yes this is a dangerous path. Mine is more along the lines of "This time, I'll be smarter". I'm not naive enough to think that "things will be different" just because. However, I'm also not stupid enough to think that good fortune and everything I want out of life will just land in my lap. You have to be willing to risk what you have to get what you want.

I actually love Plan C2... BUT... Only if they call it Bits instead of MilliBits.
A pack of gum (around USD 1.00): 2.86 bits / b2.86
Lunch in Tokyo (around USD 10.00): 28.57 bits / b28.57
A feature phone (around USD 100.00): 285.71 bits / b285.71
A decent laptop (around USD 1,000): 2,857.10 bits / b2,857.10
A decent used car (around USD 10,000): 28,571 bits / b28,571
Bits is by far the best name for the unit, however, having the transaction unit as 100,000 satoshi means the figures are much closer to the dollar amount and therefore much easier to work out how much your spending.

I had a similar idea a while ago, whereby a service like Coinbase or Bitpay could have a credit card option on their checkout, and when the payment is made the bitcoin equivalent is purchased from that company instantly behind the scenes and used to make the payment to the merchant.

Interesting idea... I think the option to release when a target BTC amount is reached OR in a set amount of time would be great. Helping people HODL for 5 years so they don't panic dump when the price drops is a useful service.
Only question is, how easy is it to transfer to a new machine? (I.e. can I have more then one copy of whatever the file is, so that if my laptop shits itself I can get a new one and continue where I left off?)

@_date: 2014-12-16 01:51:39
It's a punt, I grant you. 
If you claim a tile, and every other tile is eventually claimed, there may be articles published about the project in the media, which may send lots of traffic, which in turn could bring traffic to your own website (as you can post your own link on your tile) or can bring you tips from readers who enjoy your story. 
It could become a popular site to refer sceptics to who are unsure about bitcoin, or believe it to be just a ponzi scheme or a currency for criminals, and the stories of 1,000 genuine bitcoin users could be enough to convince them to keep an open stance towards bitcoin.
The success of the project could spawn a book, which will have a photo of every participant from the canvas and a short interview with each, including of course a QR code for sending tips directly from the page to that participant.
Then maybe people will kick themselves because they came across the project in the early stages when tiles were available, but they couldn't see the potential of where it could go, so they didn't bother.
Or maybe it will flop! And you're 0.1 BTC ($35) gamble doesn't work out.
I'm not guaranteeing anything. It depends on the people who want to take a chance on it as to whether it will become successful or not at the end of the day.
All I'm doing is posting a concept, and seeing if it works or not.

I know Amazon would be a big deal, but there's still other ways to change the game without them.

We can either get a HUGE site like Amazon to accept, or get multiple BIG sites to accept. Both will work, and both ways will tempt the remaining business to start accepting.

Not sure, but they do...
I have 2 theories:
1. The same reason merchants on sites like Groupon give up to 90% discount on products and services. Because discounts create more customers, customers which can then be re-marketed to and become repeat customers, thereby increasing the lifetime value.
2. Because Bitcoin users spend 25% on average more than fiat customers (see:  So the more people they can get into Bitcoin, the better for them when they become regular Bitcoin using customers.

I could be wrong, but my understanding is that the users are always connected to the original blockchain (i.e. the blockchain which the majority of miners are connected to).

Can you clear something up for me...
Does onename.io act as a wallet that you receive Bitcoin to and then you withdraw it to your actual address, or do they have some secure way of just automatically forwarding coins you receive to your user-friendly alias on to your actual Bitcoin address?

If he loses, he's down whatever amount he paid for his bitcoins originally. It's a very fair bet considering how confident the author is that Bitcoin is dying, it only has to drop $130 and he makes $10k in Bitcoin (which could rise in value once again), alternatively it has to rise $770 for the extremely confident author to lose.
Should be an easy $10k right? :)

Yeah perhaps. Although I can imagine by the time there’s mass adoption, no one will know or care that they’re using the LN or what it even is. That will all be behind the scenes of a user friendly app. 
But having a lightning symbol representing Sats would still make sense even from just the bolt looking like an “S” and bitcoin payments being “zapped” around instantly, like a lightning bolt.

@_date: 2017-03-31 08:42:23
Exactly how I feel. I understand that we need to take things slow and scale safely, but if something doesn't happen soon Bitcoin is not going to fulfill its promise.
Personally I think Bitcoin as it is today is an alt coin to satoshis vision. He never intended for the block size limit to stay, so as much as I would prefer decentralization and LN to run on top, technically it's not the coin he intended it to be, it has a fundamental difference. Bitcoin with a 1MB limit should have been created as an alt coin and then the market can decide what coin they find most useful.

For me, it all comes down to one statement...
Bitcoin doesn't care.
So neither do I, I just accumulate and hold. It either becomes the backbone of the entire planet, or it busts, and I'm willing to lose every penny in return for knowing that I was a part of this incredible experiment until the final result.
I'd still be proud to tell my future kids about Bitcoin and my involvement in the experiment. After all, it might make them believe in something good in this fucked world.

I'm really excited for Abra, it feels like a killer app!
One thing that is lingering in my head though... their model is based on running smart contracts on the blockchain, which is pretty cool. However, with the current situation of high fees and long confirmation times when making transactions on the network, will this impact its usability and cost effectiveness?

This looks amazing.
A teller can hold any currency on their phone (Bitcoin, dollars, pesos, whatever) but someone can still send the teller any currency for their withdrawal (as long as the teller has the physical cash to hand to them) and they will still receive the money in their preferred currency.
I hold Bitcoin but would like to allow Australians to withdraw physical Aussie dollars from me.
They send me any currency they have on their phone (dollars, pesos, British pound, whatever), but i instantly receive the Bitcoin equivalent and hand over the Australian dollar equivalent for whatever currency they sent me (minus my fee).
Pretty clever stuff. The sender has no idea I'm holding Bitcoin and it doesn't even matter what currency they send me, all I care about is the currency I end up with  (Bitcoin).

I have $1000 Aussie dollars on my Abra app.
I decide to go travelling to 5 different countries.
I jump on a plane to the first country, India, open my Abra app, find a teller and send them $50 (of which they receive the equivalent in whatever currency they have set their app up to hold, could be rupees, could be bitcoin, whatever), in return they hand me $50 worth of rupees (minus their fee).
I then jump on a plane to England. Open my Abra app, find a teller, and send them $500 worth of aussie dollars (of which they receive whatever they want to receive, pounds, bitcoin, whatever), then they hand me $500 worth of GBP.
All that matters to me is I have money on my Abra app, doesnt matter what currency I'm holding, as long as I have the app, I can go anywhere and get any currency I receive. A teller doesn't care what currency you give them either, because they will only ever receive the currency they want.
Rinse and repeat...
That's one use case.
Imagine 4 billion unbanked people with an Abra app, able to pay anyone else in the world who has an Abra app, no matter what their own currency is or what the receivers currency is.

Because a cheap and fast payments system built on top of a decentralized network is worth waiting for. If you want cheap or fast payments now, but on a more centralized network that's your choice. But as far as I'm concerned, we have had those for a long time (banks, PayPal etc). The promise of decentralization is way more important right now. Fast and cheap payments will come in time.

Tulips were never scarce, and they had no utility. Bitcoin has utility, solves various real world problems, is decentralized in nature, isn’t controllable by any government or entity, is scarce, and is a superior store of value to gold. 
The tulip bulb argument doesn’t phase me in the slightest. The people who call it a tulip bubble simply haven taken the time to understand bitcoin before commenting.
Think about how silly and small the $1,200 “bubble”  in 2013 looks now. We will feel the same way when we’re at $100,000 looking back at this $10,000 “bubble”.

Yep that’s it mate. So create a GDAX account and purchase the bitcoin amount you want. Then create a wallet (either on your desktop or on your phone is fine). I’d recommend Electrum on your desktop ( they make it fairly easy to keep your bitcoin secure by giving you 12-16 words in a particular order (this is called a “seed”) which you just have to write down and keep safe, then no matter what happens to your computer, as long as you have those words safe you can recover your bitcoin on another computer.
Just be very cautious when setting up a wallet. Make sure your computer has been scanned for viruses or spyware, and id even recommend disconnecting from the internet when you create your Electrum wallet to be extra cautious. You can also password protect your wallet so that someone would need both your seed and your password to access your bitcoin.
I hope this helps mate!

AKARTA, Indonesia—Indonesia’s central bank is pushing through a regulation prohibiting foreign currencies, including U.S. dollars, from being used in domestic transactions as it tries to get a grip on the falling rupiah.
The regulation, which takes effect Wednesday, has raised uncertainties and concerns of increased operating costs and other risks among businesses involved in mining, oil and gas, manufacturing and property: firms that transact in U.S. dollars as a hedge against the rupiah, a historically volatile currency that has been on a downward slide over the last four years.
Trust in the rupiah has been fragile ever since the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s, when its value went into free fall and Indonesia went under an International Monetary Fund rehabilitation program. The rupiah has become one of Asia’s worst-performing currencies this year, depreciating around 7% against the dollar.
Bank Indonesia says the prohibition against foreign currency in domestic transactions is intended to reduce reliance on the dollar and other foreign currencies and mitigate against capital outflows. According to Bank Indonesia, transactions within the country in currencies other than rupiah amount to $73 billion a year.
Prices for all goods and services will need to be quoted in rupiah only, a measure that will affect prices for hotels, rents and professional services, such as legal advice, insurance and accounting. For instance, around 80% of office rents are paid in U.S. dollars.
Companies fear they will be forced to bear the cost of the rupiah’s volatility and haven’t been given enough time to set up new accounting mechanisms. As is often the case with Indonesian regulations, the law empowering the ban was passed several years ago but implementation has only been announced over the past three months.
Bill Sullivan, a legal adviser to the mining, oil and gas sectors at Jakarta-based law firm Christian Teo Purwono, said companies are being forced to rapidly put in place complicated arrangements, adding to their costs.
The shift comes at a time when President Joko Widodo’s government is struggling to draw investment to help fund infrastructure projects that are badly needed in this Southeast Asian nation of 250 million people. Economic growth has hit a six-year low and confidence in the current government’s ability to manage economic policy has slumped.
“You can only implement this policy when the exit rate risk is relatively small,” said Muhamad Chatib Basri, a former finance minister and chairman of the Mandiri Institute, a research think tank affiliated with state-owned Bank Mandiri.
Peter Jacobs, a spokesman for the central bank, said Bank Indonesia would consider allowing companies more time to put the rule into effect on a project-by-project basis.
“If there are corporations that have concerns about transactions about any problems related to this, they can write us a letter and we’ll see the possibility to give them a delay,” he said.
The regulation, introduced in April, included exemptions such as export and import transactions and international financing where the lender and borrower are in different countries. Legal advisers say the rules lacked clarity and left companies with questions about what exemptions might apply to them. The bank issued a subsequent circular earlier this month, but hasn’t granted any delays.
Affected businesses say they are trying to minimize the impact of the regulation by building in market-based adjustments to help offset the rupiah’s volatility. Some property companies are considering a dollar-linked rupiah rate that changes with each billing cycle.
Mr. Sullivan anticipates that equipment suppliers and others will increase their prices in rupiah to account for the risk of depreciation. That won’t be good for those needing those services at a time when industries such as mining and oil and gas are increasingly worried about costs, he says.
A person familiar with the negotiations said companies aren't necessarily opposed to the regulation, but they need less of a “light switch” conversion and a more staged implementation. Others say gray areas need clarification and that there needs to be a better understanding of how penalties will be enforced.
“Basically, we support the Bank Indonesia policy, but we need guidance from them for the existing contracts,” said Budi Setiadi, vice president for government regulations at PetroChina, a state-owned Chinese firm with several oil and gas blocks in Indonesia. Under the regulation, existing contracts denominated in U.S. dollars are valid until they undergo a revision.
The regulation includes activities associated with export transactions. In the mining industry, that includes items such as insurance, barges and loading and unloading of goods at ports.

Id recommend watching some videos by Andreas Antonopoulos on his YouTube channel to get your mind blown about Bitcoin (
In regards to changing the format, this really would come organically through usage and how the people decide to denominate when it comes to paying for things. However, what would make it happen very quickly is if the leading bitcoin wallets and exchanges added the functionality to view your balance and pay for things in “bits”. Some wallets already let you view your balance in “bits”. I personally think it’ll just be a matter of time before it’s widely used in that manner.

Thanks for your reply. Makes sense.
I guess I was thinking if fees weren't the source of income for miners, and their revenue was only from the rewards, they would be less concerned financially and perhaps better act on behalf of the users in relation to scaling etc.
Happy to accept it was flawed thinking. Just wanted to get some further thoughts from people who understand the way it works better than I do. 
Good job I said "maybe", helped me save face a little :)
Also, I have to say, I personally don't believe there can or should be such a thing as "spam" on the network. If I want to send a fraction of a cent to a million addresses, that's my right as an equal participant of the network no? Wasn't the end goal that anyone can send any amount to any address whenever they want? Just my opinion though, I'm not a developer, just your average user.

It's not designed to entice users to use your site, although this could be a side effect.
The idea is that getting withdrawals from any online service back into your bank account takes time, and Bitcoin could be an option for those who want to withdraw straight away, or those who have wanted to play with Bitcoin but didn't want to go through the current process of signing up to exchanges and doing the whole KYC/AML mess around.
What harm does it do having an additional withdrawal option? There is literally no downside. You can continue to do it your usual way, or you can withdraw Bitcoin.

I won’t be cashing out of bitcoin regardless of price, because I’m in it for the long term and I’ve seen the price collapse many times before, this is no different. I’ll be holding my bitcoins until I can spend them, I’ll never swap them back for fiat.

Under their logic, they gave an asset a C+ score and it crashed 50%. Shouldn’t that have been graded an F or something if they *knew* what was going to happen?
They’re just twisting shit to match their agenda. Had bitcoin just doubled, they’d likely have said “NOW do you see why we gave it a C+? It is extremely unpredictable and volatile!”
@_date: 2017-09-13 21:49:19
I understand your point, however there are also other factors at play here. 
For example, some Redditors may buy 0.1 coin, 1 coin, 5 coins, 10 coins instead of the 0.066 they'd actually need, which would allow other redditors to buy less coins for the same end result. 
Also, there are 16.5 million bitcoins today, but not that many are actually for sale, so there is a lot less actually available to go around, making 0.066 a massive overestimate of how many each Redditor would need. 
My final point is, this post wasn't meant to be some super accurate, economically thought through, calculated certainty of what would happen... it was meant to get people thinking about the overall concept of the current supply of coins that are to be shared between everyone, and even if it was just reddit users who wanted some, there wouldn't be enough... which I'm happy to say has succeeded. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 21:53:03
It's just a thought experiment, I understand that price goes up as demand goes up. I'm a reddit user who owns a lot more than 0.066, lets say in theory I owned 24 bitcoins, that's 360ish redditors who don't need to buy 0.066 worth because I'd have covered them. They could each buy $10 worth at whatever price bitcoin is at when they jump in, and they'd still be helping make bitcoin scarce.

Cool, thanks.
What would happen in the event that I only have some transaction history, but not every single transaction? 
For example, lets say I bought some ether in the pre-sale back in 2014, and although I know the address I sent funds to, I don’t know what address I sent from, so I can’t prove the amount of bitcoin I spent. What would happen here?

Patrick wants all Wall Street trades to be processed via the Blockchain, which will allow transparency and will prevent fraudulent activity. So he created t0 to be that platform.
Also, the standard time it takes to settle a trade is 3 days, which is where the term "t3" comes from, but if done via the blockchain, this will happen within 10 mins, therefore Patrick called the platform "t0".

Sorry, what I mean by that is it's not that I'm having a problem with an unconfirmed transaction, it's that the transaction isn't even awaiting confirmations. It literally hasn't been broadcasted to the network.

Wouldn't you agree that big Bitcoin businesses, such as Coinbase, BitPay, Gemini and Xapo, who service a large portion of the bitcoin users, are making a agreement and a decision without any consensus or feedback from their users?
Wouldn't you agree that not implementing replay protection is irresponsible and careless?
Wouldn't you agree that Bitcoin being able to be controlled by a few business owners in a backroom deal isn't how Bitcoin is supposed to upgrade?

Thanks for your help with this, I seem to have had my coins exposed for 3.5 years because I didn't know this.
So my BIP 38 paper wallet is only secure from theft if it ONLY shows the private key (starting with 6P) and NOT if it shows the WIF key (starting with 5). Is that right?
So technically I can remove and destroy the WIF key off my paper wallet and it'll be secure because I still have the 6P key and the password?

I first heard about bitcoin in 2010 when my work colleague mentioned it to me. I actually wanted to buy some Bitcoin to see how it works, but after about 30 minutes of reading up on it and not understanding how it worked and how to get my hands on some, I gave up... 
3 years later I see on the news that it reached $1,200 per coin. That's when I decided that the time it takes to understand Bitcoin would be worth it. I've been learning and buying ever since, and love it. My favorite part of every morning is logging on to and seeing whats going on in the Bitcoin world.
Ironically... I'm still in touch with that work colleague and he's a huge skeptic who doesn't see Bitcoin's place in the future.

Hal Finney's Response:


security on the assumption that the CPU power of honest participants
outweighs that of the attacker. It is a very modern notion that exploits
the power of the long tail. When Wikipedia started I never thought it
would work, but it has proven to be a great success for some of the
same reasons.


token whose production rate is predictable and can't be influenced
by corrupt parties. This would be more analogous to gold than to fiat
currencies. Nick Szabo wrote many years ago about what he called "bit
gold"[1] and this could be an implementation of that concept. There have
also been proposals for building light-weight anonymous payment schemes on
top of heavy-weight non-anonymous systems, so Bitcoin could be leveraged
to allow for anonymity even beyond the mechanisms discussed in the paper.


paper describes key concepts and some data structures, but does not
clearly specify the various rules and verifications that the participants
in the system would have to follow.


perform when they receive new blocks from other nodes, and how they
handle transactions that have been broadcast to them. For example, it
is mentioned that if a broadcast transaction does not reach all nodes,
it is OK, as it will get into the block chain before long. How does this
happen - what if the node that creates the "next" block (the first node
to find the hashcash collision) did not hear about the transaction,
and then a few more blocks get added also by nodes that did not hear
about that transaction? Do all the nodes that did hear it keep that
transaction around, hoping to incorporate it into a block once they get
lucky enough to be the one which finds the next collision?


it waits to see which grows fastest, and a block comes in for chain A
which would include a double-spend of a coin that is in chain B? Is that
checked for or not? (This might happen if someone double-spent and two
different sets of nodes heard about the two different transactions with
the same coin.)


that are flowing around is largely missing from the paper.


transactions, is accomplished by a superior attacker who is able to muster
more computing power than all the honest participants. I see that he can
create new blocks and add them to create the longest chain, but how can
he erase or add old transactions in the chain? As the attacker sends out
his new blocks, aren't there consistency checks which honest nodes can
perform, to make sure that nothing got erased? More explanation of this
attack would be helpful, in order to judge the gains to an attacker from
this, versus simply using his computing power to mint new coins honestly.


coin have to perform? Does she need to go back through the coin's entire
history of transfers, and make sure that every transaction on the list is
indeed linked into the "timestamp" block chain? Or can she just do the
latest one? Do the timestamp nodes check transactions, making sure that
the previous transaction on a coin is in the chain, thereby enforcing
the rule that all transactions in the chain represent valid coins?


very promising and original idea, and I am looking forward to seeing
how the concept is further developed. It would be helpful to see a more
process oriented description of the idea, with concrete details of the
data structures for the various objects (coins, blocks, transactions),
the data which is included in messages, and algorithmic descriptions
of the procedures for handling the various events which would occur in
this system. You mentioned that you are working on an implementation,
but I think a more formal, text description of the system would be a
helpful next step.

Hey Erik, just to be clear, the biggest companies in Bitcoin support SegWitX2, but that doesn't mean their users do. In fact, it seems to me that a lot of users are furious about the stances from these companies. Just my two cents...
I really hope you know something we all don't and there's a bigger picture we're not seeing. If this all goes through as you'd like and it really does work out for the best, you'll be owed a lot of apologies, but I really feel that this isn't the case. The solution put forward with the block size increase may well be correct, but something is seriously wrong with the method used to make this upgrade. Surely you know this?
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:25:50
There's a huge difference between developers who create upgrades, get feedback and allow the Bitcoin community to accept or reject it, and a group of business owners making a change without consensus and forcing the change to happen (resulting in a fork without replay protection may I add). It's night and day.
Like I said in my post, even if the solution they put forward is what is best for Bitcoin, the method of delivery is absolutely the opposite. This has nothing to do with what I think a successful Bitcoin looks like.

While I agree with you on Bitcoin not being ready for mainstream, what happens when the mainstream is ready for Bitcoin? 
It seems like new technologies don't have many chances to show their value to new users, and if the main use of the technology (making a transaction) isn't fast, reasonably cheap, and seamless, those users don't care, they go back to what they were using.
We all don't want that right? We would all love to see a world running on Bitcoin transactions, right? We'd all love to see the network explode with new users/transactions etc. isn't that the dream?
I want a safe scaling solution, so I'm personally prepared to wait (as I have for 3.5 years so far) whilst that happens. However the mainstream isn't prepared to wait. It's either ready and useful now (whilst it's got their attention), or it's just a disappointment and they move on.
I feel embarrassed that there are lots of new users in Japan coming on board every day, I wish they'd wait a couple more years til Bitcoin is ready, but it's not something we can decide anymore.

J.P. Morgan Has a New Twist on Blockchain
The bank’s project is being built off the publicly accessible Ethereum network code

J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. is working on a new twist on the technology behind bitcoin that would allow the bank to use a publicly available system for confidential transactions.
The move is a break with how some banks have approached the use of a bitcoin-style network, known generally as the blockchain, to try to replace creaking old systems with faster new technology. Instead of creating a completely new private blockchain, J.P. Morgan engineers say they have found a way to limit access to transactions shared via a network to people who need to know the details, like parties to the trade or a regulator.
The project—called Quorum—is being built off the publicly accessible Ethereum network code. J.P. Morgan, run by Chief Executive James Dimon, plans to share its new code for its system with outside developers, something the bank has recently started doing as a way to entice top engineers to work with the bank and take advantage of the latest developments in blockchain.
It also is a vote of confidence in Ethereum, which is the network where a separate application created by venture-capital firm DAO was hacked, leading to the theft of $55 million worth of digital currency. Ethereum’s founders said the hack didn’t affect the core network, but the problem split holders of the digital currency between those who wanted to undo the hack and others who wanted to maintain the idea that blockchains are immutable.
Despite high-profile hacks and other technical problems with bitcoin, Ethereum, and other virtual currencies, banks remain enamored with the idea of using the new technologies to cut costs and make a whole host of processes simpler and more efficient.
“We have people building the most stress-tested financial systems in the world,” said Amber Baldet, program lead for J.P. Morgan on Quorum and other blockchain projects. “Bringing that enterprise expertise [to blockchain] is one of our strengths.”
In recent months, engineers at J.P. Morgan have been jumping into Ethereum to solve a problem that has complicated the use of blockchains at banks: making it private enough for traders, but public enough for regulators.
The Quorum project joins a technology arms race with numerous other Wall Street firms, software giants and assorted startups. The goal is to use such systems to save huge costs and build faster and more stable systems that benefit both customers and the bank itself.
If Quorum catches on, it could give the bank a head start over rivals who have invested in separate, private blockchain networks.
In banking, blockchain is still in an embryonic phase, with projects in testing and little clarity regarding the technology’s ultimate usefulness. It also isn’t clear how regulators might view the idea of banks working off more public networks.
The hope among Quorum’s developers is that blockchain can solve some of banks’ most intractable problems by replacing a web of connected databases with a single, shared, immutable record of transactions. The problems targeted include long and expensive settlement times, system breakdowns and lack of clarity about risk exposures. Banks will spend more than $1 billion this year on blockchain investments, Greenwich Associates has estimated.
Skeptics say that blockchain may ultimately be a hyped-up version of banks’ existing, struggling systems. But for the first firms to devise a new system, success could be very lucrative, resulting in big cost savings and possibly new revenue from selling software services.
U.S. regulators haven’t yet taken a strong stance on blockchain. But most agencies have said they are hoping that it would give them a detailed, real-time view of what is going on in opaque markets, while not sacrificing anything on the important goal of keeping banks’ data secure from hackers.
In a speech earlier this year, Federal Reserve governor Lael Brainard said that she was “optimistic” about new technologies, but added that they “must be robust in practice, not just in theory, to attacks on security, and must be able to maintain appropriate confidentiality for records and data.”
The bitcoin blockchain, as it was first developed in 2008, creates a public history of all transactions in the cryptocurrency, but keeps the parties anonymous.
A cottage industry has emerged to apply bitcoin technology to banks. Startups such as R3 CEV, Digital Asset Holdings, Symbiont and Axoni have been joined by technology giants Microsoft Corp. and International Business Machines Corp.

Thanks for your reply!
Yeah this is the strange thing. He 100% set a BIP38 password under the "paper wallet" tab and generated a wallet. We then copied the private key into the "wallet details" area to test if it worked. It asked for the password when we tried to view the wallet info. Then it displayed all the wallet info (multiple addresses and multiple versions of the private key). Then we printed that page and that's what he's using as the paper wallet.
Are there any keys on that page which don't require the BIP38 password to access the coins?

It feels like a lose lose. 
If he agrees and signals segwit, we moved forward on his say so, how is that good for Bitcoin?
If he disagrees and continues not to signal segwit, he continues to slow bitcoins progress, which also isn't good for Bitcoin.

Hey man, I felt compelled to comment as I was in a very similar position. 
I lost $54,000 back in early 2014 by playing in the forex markets. Fortunately I also bought some bitcoin at the same time, and held onto it. At the time I bought bitcoin I watched it drop from $1200 to $180 and continued to buy because I believed in it and understood it would change the world.
Today I hold many multiples more than the $54,000 I lost and that would not be the case had I not held and been patient.
My advice to you is to continue to learn everything you can about bitcoin and hold what you have for at least 2 years. Until then, relax and enjoy life. You haven’t lost anything until you sell. 
@_date: 2015-10-07 03:37:11
Bear in mind he did say "in two years you will see some pretty amazing things in bitcoin", he didn't say in two years bitcoin will go mainstream.
@_date: 2017-05-18 23:33:31
This exactly...
It's not just a case of paying higher fees. Let's say all 200k transactions paid the higher fee, does that mean they'll all get in to the next block? Of course not. It just means the fee to get into the next block is now even higher because there's limited space.
@_date: 2017-05-24 20:40:30
I don't think anyone here understood my point. I said "physical" envelopes. Not illustrations. Illustrations make sense as it then looks digital. If the media used illustrations of bitcoins it would make more sense than showing the physical coins they've been showing.

Whilst that is true... there is a huge market for coffee sized transactions of which the fees are too high. That market is called the "unbanked".

The great thing is you don't have to. No one is making you buy Bitcoin and no one has told you to (yet you're telling people to sell which is strange). 
Unfortunately I've been forced to use declining fiat currency my whole life, and now I don't have to. So I choose not to. Fortunately I have that choice and it doesn't matter what you think about that choice. 
Bitcoin is 9 years old. Not that it matters. Gold was also once 9 years old, as were  dollar bills, credit cards, PayPal etc. means nothing how old technology is.
Young and naive, perhaps. But hey, I've got bigger balls :)
There will be no tears, I bought into this experiment with the mindset that it's either going to be huge or it'll go to zero. So far I've been right.

Why does it have to overtake traditional currency to be useful? You're thinking way too small, probably because you have access to a bank account and the financial system. What about the other 4 billion people of the world who don't? Bitcoin is their best option right now.
@_date: 2017-05-18 07:29:36
Ok, so you saying that we will one day scale to be useful and affordable for everyone, it's just a matter of time?
If so, great! I agree. My original comment was in response to "People want a store of value, being able to buy coffee isn't something the market needs", which is very righteous of someone in the western world to say.
What I was saying was that people need bitcoin for different reasons, some people in third world countries need bitcoin to be cheap to use and accessible, so we need to cater for both markets, not just the rich.
I don't mind waiting, the time it takes to scale wasn't my complaint.

No idea.. but this is fun to watch. Trade volume is jumping up in huge chunks at both Coinbase and Bitstamp.
@_date: 2017-05-18 06:30:01
Sorry I don't follow... there are cheap mobile phones ($10) and there are expensive smart phones ($1000+). Third-world countries can access mobile phones because they can afford the lower end devices. 
Whereas Bitcoin fees are the same regardless. Therefore spending bitcoin is affordable for westerners making high value transactions, but too expensive for third-world countries making "coffee size" transactions. 
So not really the same concept at all... or am I missing something?

Where can I buy this?
@_date: 2015-10-01 00:21:12
For me its simply about public perception. If big companies like Dell, Microsoft and Expedia accept bitcoin, if Wall Street are investing in Bitcoin companies, if NASDAQ are trialing blockchain technology and if the banks are leveraging the use of the blockchain, then Bitcoin is no longer a "scam", "ponzi scheme", "currency for criminals" etc etc.
That's the reason I measure it as success.
At the end of the day, the use of the blockchain by more and more entities (including banks) is a good thing and is what having an open ledger is for.
Crypto doesn't need banks, like you say. The banks need crypto, and that's why I personally equate bank adoption with success.
@_date: 2015-02-14 23:53:20
Dan Bilzerian will do this, he's a fan of Bitcoin and he's got a life every man wants.
@_date: 2017-05-30 02:25:33
Yeah agreed. A small group of determined users can't force anything, either the market moves to the alternative version which has SegWit and therefore it becomes the new chain, or the chain splits and the market stays on the non-SegWit chain. So how exactly is that not bitcoin working the way it's supposed to? A minority may push for a new version, but unless everyone agrees, it doesn't happen right?

Bitcoin Adoption in Africa is Happening But by the Wrong Hands
It is still early days for Bitcoin in Sub-Saharan Africa. Indeed, it is still something unheard of in much of the continent and the message has been slow in spreading. However, in the last few months the tempo seems to have gone up many notches and all that is thanks to an enthusiastic group of people whose actions the rest of the Bitcoin community should be wary about.
Of course, being a decentralized community, there is no central authority to either guide or put down the rules of the evangelization. Everyone is welcome to make Bitcoin known and used through the best means they know how. That seems to be a problem. Indeed a major one right now in Africa.
This is especially given that Bitcoin is still fighting negative publicity in the West emanating from its use in the deep web (read Silk Road).
In the recent months, an organization known by the name MMM Global has been aggressively marketing itself on the continent. It has already recruited hundreds of thousands of South Africans into its ranks.
Contributor on LetsTalkBitcoin, “…..certain factors lead me to believe that MMM is poised to become a major scandal for Bitcoin. First, it is exploding in popularity, especially among people who have little previous exposure to Bitcoin.”
It is shifting its attention to the neighboring Southern African countries as well as East Africa and West Africa. In order to function in the MMM Global community, new recruits are asked to acquire Bitcoin wallets and buy Bitcoins.
Talk of knowing Bitcoin in the wrong circumstances!
For the majority of these new members, it is the first time they ever hear of Bitcoin. As a matter of fact, MMM Global organizes seminars in towns and villages where, among other things in the orientation course, recruits are taught how to use Bitcoin.
On the face of it, this seems to be a welcome campaign-a noble course, but that is until you scratch off the surface MMM Global. On its website, it describes itself as an organization that provides ordinary people with a platform on which to help one another.
On the MMM Global, online platform members provide and receive financial help. However, how it works is not that simple, though. Basically, for every financial help you give, you receive the amount back with an interest that ranges between 30% and 100%.
As a member, you also stand to earn bonuses for introducing new members. As a matter of fact, for each person you introduce, you get 10% of every help they give or receive. You also become the leader of the people you introduce as well as those they introduce.
In other words, MMM Global is a pyramid scheme.
Apparently MMM Global has branches in 100 countries, with a total of over 134 million members. The bulk of its community is found in Russia, the Philippines and South Africa. The organization claims to have handled about 14 billion dollars so far.
It is another Ponzi scheme.
The bad news about MMM Global begins with the history of its founder. Mr. Sergei Mavrodi founded the first version of MMM Global in 1987. It closed shop in 1997. In 2007, a Russian court found him guilty of defrauding 10,000 investors $4.3 million and was handed a four and half year prison time.
Of course, a pyramid scheme will not concern the Bitcoin community more than it does the general public. However, when you consider that the pyramid scheme is introducing Bitcoin to its new members for the first time alongside its product, then there is reason worry. The members may never differentiate Bitcoin and the scheme.
Bobby Lee, CEO BTCC on MMM, “We have posted warnings on our site and on our social media to warn users to be careful, but they have been coming to our exchange and buying out like crazy.”
It, therefore, means that in the case of the scheme collapses, the members tricked of their money will remain with the impression that Bitcoin is the currency for scammers. It is not easy to convince them later that Bitcoin has a good side.
While this is not an indictment on MMM Global, it does not auger well that it is through someone with the history of Mr. Sergei Mavrodi that people should hear about Bitcoin for the very first time.

I can improve this idea...
"Decentralized Den" - Dragon's Den meets Kickstarter.
The entreprenuers pitch to the camera, the audience ask questions via tweets (most popular questions are answered), then there's a 30 second window where a QR code is displayed on screen and the audience watching can donate whatever amount towards their idea.
If they reach the fund target in 30 seconds, they keep the cash, if they don't, all the Bitcoin transactions are reversed back to the senders and they walk away with nothing.
The suspense and interactivity of the show will be awesome...
I'm sure it's flawed somehow, but still sounds awesome...
@_date: 2017-05-07 06:13:33
Yeah, again, you're missing the point. YOU don't give a fuck if your BANK knows where you shop. Sounds like you have a bank? Cool, most people do not, bitcoin helps those people.
As for hiding transactions, Bitcoin isn't anonymous, even though the uneducated think it is. It's pseudonymous.
As for collapsing, the dollar has been in free fall since its inception. Losing 99% of its value. Bitcoin is doing the opposite.
You can trust your government and banks, il trust mathematics. 
Also, funny how there's no reason for people to use Bitcoin yet there's 250k+ Bitcoin transactions per day.
@_date: 2015-02-09 02:20:00
The quickest, cheapest and easiest way of marketing Bitcoin is tipping.
If everyone tips celebs on twitter every day consistently, chances are at some point one of them will bite and accept the tip. In which case "CELEB X accepts Bitcoin" can be plastered all over the place, and all their fans will be more inclined to purchase some themselves, even if it's because they want to be able to tip celebs too.
Also, if celebs start understanding how tipping works, chances are one of their PR/Marketing team will suggest tipping a random fan $1,000 or similar, because suddenly that makes the news and gets that celeb publicity, and then what else gets publicity? Bitcoin...
The other great thing is everyone can contribute, and you only lose money if it works (i.e. if no one accepts the tips, you get them back in 7 days anyway).
It might seem optimistic, but I'm telling you now, at some point we will see a popular celeb send a Bitcoin tip and it will be the best thing they ever did from a Marketing/PR perspective.
Edit: I'm also a marketer. I run an Online Marketing Agency in Brisbane, Australia.

The bigger question is, why didn't you read up on how Bitcoin works before purchasing it? Don't blame others for your own actions.
