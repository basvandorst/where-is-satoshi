I think a large amount of subscribers are merely interested in BTC and not actual users.  This group includes me because I have read every single tutorial and still have no idea how the fuck to actually use it.  I'm also not a big computer guy, so yeah.

It's basically an open platform for musicians all over the world to sell their stuff.  It's extremely popular with independents, for obvious reasons.  Tons of the stuff is free anyway, but with such an international audience, it only makes sense. [link](

Litecoin sounds interesting.  Thanks for expressing your opposing opinion.  It's a rare thing on reddit and I appreciate it.

What service would it link to?  Is there one that has pulled ahead of the pack yet?
@_date: 2012-11-14 01:49:56
maybe i was reading too much into mining?

Okay, but the bandcamp community is pretty massive.  Just because you aren't a part of it doesn't mean it is insignificant.  I brought up bandcamp because it is a global indie community that's sole purpose is the buying and selling of digital goods.  In a similar way, Steam would be a huge breakthrough.
I don't see Wordpress as a big deal because it is not inherently about buying and selling things.  Most people don't even know what you would pay for at wordpress, or rather why you would pay for it.


What are you hoping for? Just out of curiosity...

Windows ME? lol

How did you get this site to work?  It seems that you have every single book that amazon has...
Also, do you only sell books? If so, why?
@_date: 2012-11-14 02:18:37
so which site should i use? coinbase seems to look the best, visually speaking. blockchain looks good, too. virwox is pretty confusing.  can you recommend a good one-stop-shop?

I can't wait for the debit card to be released. That will be a game changer.

Yep, and the ones opposite of the hivemind get downvoted.  Every time.
Thanks for the info on Litecoin.  I read more about them and came to the same conclusion :)

How? No Person is regulating it, so it's not exactly up to what the people want.
@_date: 2013-11-14 19:04:51


And because of that, most people are hoarding and not spending. Some say that this will only change with some "killer app" for bitcoin. I don't know, though. As it stands now, it seems like a plaything for investors and greedy people.


The difference is that the government has guns, though.

Do you think it makes sense as a store of value then? In the future, will people's life savings be in Bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-11-14 18:29:37
How could it ever? With Bitcoin's prices constantly in flux, it will never level out to a degree that you won't need something to compare it to. It's not, "This pizza will cost .005 BTC", it's "Well, this pizza is 15 USD, so at this hour that will be ___ BTC".
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:12:38


Actually, I think that was the correct one.
@_date: 2013-11-15 19:13:15
But why on earth would you spend it? You would be losing money at a very rapid rate.
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:11:48
Seriously, who the hell gets an "allowance" these days?

Some people live their whole lives wearing masks, and happily, too. You can only imagine them in their marriage home, each crying in the bathroom when they finally have time to be with themselves.
Good on them for raising awareness though.
@_date: 2013-08-15 00:39:34
Ugh, this is why I never want to buy bitcoin. Why won't it just stabilize already?
@_date: 2013-09-01 17:50:55
You're post is confusing to me. 
Do you think that CEO's for massive companies have utopian dreams for the world? How could you trust them so much to be the next leaders of the world? Implying that they will take care of everyone and include everyone in the next beautiful democracy.
Why do you say that the age of agriculture is over when you just implied that the middle ages farmers were happier than blue collar workers today? Not to mention that people still need to eat, right? 
How will aquaponics change anything? Aquaponics has been around for a long, long time, after all. Is it because farms will now be in skyscrapers and not taking up larger amounts of land? In that case, only the super rich could afford to have aquaponic operations anyway, so it still comes back to massive Monsanto-esque corporations, no?
You just seemed to have listed a string of buzz words. There's no real explanations behind any of your thinking here.
@_date: 2013-11-15 19:09:00
I think my question is more relevant today than it was in 2010. If you explain bitcoin to someone today they will certainly think it's some kind of Madoff scam. It's a literal gravy train that never stops. Why would you spend ANY of it when hoarding can get you so much richer?
(By the way, I didn't downvote you.)
