Well if you like you can pay in fiat also but Bitcoin is preferred!

Dear fellow,
Thanks for liking the idea. I just want to point out something that I think you are misunderstood about.
First of all, these carpets are supposed to represent positivity and we are not here to make quick money! This was a nice idea that happened JUST FOR FUN in the beginning and there were no thoughts business-wise on it. Once it was posted, many requests on it were received and that was the only reason we decided to build a small shop for the Bitcoiners who are interested.
Talking about quality, I should tell you that they are not mechanically made and the fabric being used to make them is the best quality fabric(The quality has been observed by the ones who have touched it already). To add, if you noticed there is no shipping fee and shipping them plus dealing with Iranian custom to export them is not an easy task!
Anyway, I would like to thank you for your opinion and I should say that we are talking to the weavers to offer us the best they can so that we can offer them even cheaper than they are now.
Overall, these carpets are not making money for us and they are signs to show LOVE to Bitcoin and this beautiful technology.

Thanks Shayan jan ;)
@_date: 2015-03-29 14:31:17
This is made of  "heat set fabric acrylic thread".
Thank you btw...
@_date: 2015-03-31 07:47:24
Well it is of course up to you to think the way you like. But just two points to mention:
1. Acrylic handmade carpets are popular because they cost less than wool. If you want to have the same carpet weaved using wool it would cost twice or even 3 times more that what it is now. If you know carpets and its quality measurements you would know this too!
2. When you receive the order, you can always check the source of the carpet to make sure they are not from China and have been sent from Iran(well if you still want to be pessimistic you could say that we are shipping them to Iran and then we are sending them from Iran to other parts of the world which does not make sense for us to do so!)
And finally, I want to mention this again that, I am a Bitcoiner and a believer. I work in the telecom field and carpet selling is not my job or a shop for me to make money from(I just do this for fun). I simply like raising awareness about this technology and get more and more people to know this.
@_date: 2015-03-31 15:31:11
Definitely perfect idea ;)
