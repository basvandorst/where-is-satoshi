As strange as this may seem to you, earth has many different dates and times going on at the same time, which we call "time zones". While it may be 5PM on Aug 13 for you, somewhere else it may be 7AM on Aug 14. It's pretty crazy.

Uh earth to Brint, I'm not so sure you did cuz you were all "That doesnt look like 180 lines" like you *didn't* know it was a joke!

Earth to Brint, I was making a joke.

Why buy food and water when you can buy Bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-11-25 21:37:32
They understand how it works, they just feel there isn't much you can do with it, other than to "hold it" basically. Just... holding it.
I get there are ways to spend it, but I gotta agree - not much reason to actually use bitcoin other than to gamble with it, meaning, investing money into it and hoping it goes up in value after x amount of years.
@_date: 2019-11-25 23:39:36
Why would I convert money into bitcoin when buying stuff? That's just unneeded extra steps.
 Let's be frank here, 99% of us here are just hoping it goes up in value so we can cash out. Let's not fool ourselves.

You could, Unless bitcoin devalues. Then it's not really protecting you from anything. Your money could be trapped for years until it recovers, else you lose money selling at a loss.
Bitcoin is a risky place to keep money - don't try to tell anyone otherwise, you would be lying.

No He's right.... Never mind batting an eye, he wouldn't even NOTICE it.
Bill losing $2.8 million, if he had $28 Billion, is like a person who has $1000 in the bank losing 10c.
Bill doesn't keep track of how many millions he has, just like you or I don't keep track of cents. He would probably have someone telling him he lost 3 million dollars though, but as for he himself batting an eye? Nope. He wouldn't even notice it in the first place.

Who else can we get to buy tho? I'm getting desperate here... my friends are also getting out of bitcoin
@_date: 2019-08-06 01:33:01
Yeah, we've all heard about bitcoin by now.
IT'S AMAZING. Haven't you heard about bitcoin? Bitcoin is better than money. Crypto is the future! Did you see it on CNN?

Wouldn't very low fees mean there is no incentive to process peoples transactions, once all the reward blocks are mined? Honest question.
@_date: 2019-01-07 16:42:05
Of course... but like, when that happens, who's gonna mine bitcoin transactions if the transaction reward is next to nothing, thanks to the lightning network?

...and how many satoshis make up that "1" in each system?
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:20:33
Yeah, it might be a good investment for you who bought a coin at maybe $1000, to "crash" to $7000.... but what about everyone who bought at $9000, $10K, $12K, $15K or $19K?
All those people lost money, losing anything between 10% to 60% of their worth, depending at which point they bought.
So, while it may have turned out alright for you, it didn't turn out too well for anybody buying at a price of $10K - $20K per bitcoin.
Congrats on you making some money, but a lot of people had to each lose part of their money for you to gain that $7000. Those people may be burned and butthurt, and never come back - so you need a new batch of suckers.

But this guy made a cartoon-show meme, surely he's an experienced trader and not a kid?
@_date: 2018-07-11 16:32:16
Great, he should buy some then.
Why tell us? Why not use it to his advantage and profit. oh wait, that's exactly why he tells us - so people can buy and he can profit.
@_date: 2015-11-04 07:56:33
Nice! Let me know if you want a real logo man - I'm not very expensive!
I'll give anyone who reads this a 33% discount if you pay via bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-05-27 13:47:43
Yeah you can say "This is sound money/newer/better/etc" but to me it's starting to get pitched as "Everybody buy this and hold it so that I as an earlier buyer can profit from it"
Like the only point it has is to buy it and sit on it until x number of years has passed and then you sell it. Sort of like a house, except you can't do anything with it in the meantime, it's just an invisible number.
@_date: 2019-05-26 23:31:02
So everyone should just buy this thing and hold it? I gotta ask though... what for?
