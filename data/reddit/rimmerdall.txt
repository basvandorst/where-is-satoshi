Just to jumpstart my own thread, I just came up with one idea. Hand out paper wallets with tiny amounts of bitcoin on them. Say like a penny or a nickel. "Free bitcoin, sir, would you like some free bitcoin?" Lots of people ignore me, and a few take it, most of those people forget about it, but a few of them start to do their own research. If I'm lucky enough to get a question, or conversation started, I could explain to them why they shouldn't trust me since I've seen the private key, and look into transferring their money to their own paper wallet, or possibly show them how to use a blockchain.info wallet right then and there. FWIW I live in the Chicago area and that's why my mind is starting on this pamphlet/free stuff idea. It's what I have seen the PETA, Jewish-Jesus believers, gay rights activists, and Misrecordea people do.
Edit: I could make an informational packet (one sheet of computer paper, folded in half) targeting casual smartphone users completely unfamiliar with crytpcurrency. It would contain the afformentioned paper wallet on the back page. I could upload it and link to it here for scrutiny/suggestions, and when finished tack it on the walls at coffee and music shops, hand it out, etc. I would need to familiarize myself with the iphone way of doing things, since I am an android user and am unfamiliar with the steps an iphone user would need to take to use their phone for bitcoin transactions.
Edit: 
Primary packet goal -- present the process of obtaining and using bitcoins in a clear, simple, easy to follow way
Secondary goal -- provide a basic understanding of what cryptocurrencies are and how they work
Tertiary goal -- Provide motivation for personal research, possibly by introducing the possibilities beyond currency/store of value (while maintaining a politically neutral stance).
I have a bit of sales experience, but I'm honestly not very good. Reccomendations from anyone with education and/or sales experience on the goal priorities would be especially appreciated! I am particularly interested if the goal heirarchy should be reversed!

And also impossible, since people would just move to a different coin if something like that happened.

The other day I started a thread asking how I might spread bitcoin awareness. In the midst of my brainstorm I thought maybe a pamphlet would be a good idea, but I was told to 'tone down the autism' among other things. Well, with a bit of spite, here is exactly what I was looking for. At least *someone* else gets it.

Nothing is wrong with a link. Your problem is that you're using the most unfree, proprietary, mindlock technology company on the planet and they are afraid of bitcoin.

"I'm saying while living where I live now, I cannot opt out of being ruled by the federal government."
No, what you said is: "You cannot opt out of being ruled by the government."
Continuing your new qualifier all the way through the comparison looks like this:
"Living where I am now, I cannot opt out of being ruled by the federal government. Using the same phone I use now, I cannot opt out of the Apple ecosystem."
You cannot apply something like that to only one side of the analogy.
Question for you. How would you even go about defining 'the use of force' in the digital realm? Since we are talking about Apple as a 'government of the digital realm' here. I'd say banning certain apps from user access is a form of use of force in the digital realm. Apple THEMSELVES can force you to use their appstore. Apple THEMSELVES can coerce you into using their proprietary file formats. And Apple THEMSELVES can call upon outside resources (such as US law enforcement) to reclaim hardware, if they wish to do so.

Wow I'm sorry this happened to you. I made an MCXnow account when I was first deciding on an exchange to use, and your story makes me very glad I ended up using Bitfinex instead...
Edit: Wow. provide sympathy, get downvoted? I not understand.

Saw him speak at a Chicago bitcion meetup. I agree perfect for TED.
Done and Done for Ted2015 Truth &amp; Dare.
Truth and Dare
Great TED Talks often do one or both of the following:
... They give you a new lens on the world as it is.
... They offer new possibilities for the world as it might be.
For TED2015, we're on a quest to magnify both facets. We will seek to challenge and reshape our core beliefs about today's reality. And at the same time celebrate the thinkers, dreamers and mavericks who offer bold new alternatives.  Welcome to ... Truth and Dare.

I'm looking at it again and now it says "SPAM SEND" where the address should be. Still, no link though. How did they get my public key? Is this a red flag that I'm not being careful enough with my transactions?
Thank you for the warning!!

The downvoters probably thought I was being snarky, and didn't actually take the time to learn what the Byzantine General's problem is, or how Bitcoin solves it.
@_date: 2014-03-25 15:21:05
How do you mean? Obviously this is not a pitch for bitcoin, or how I go around talking to people. This is planning and brainstorming, the whole idea of which is to turn the filter off and write things down. I guess I should apologize for thinking reddit would be a good place to do that sort of thing. Here's to the hope that more responses will be composed of helpful advice instead of presumptuous and abusive voices like yours. Cheers.

Being the pessimist I am, I expect most people are going to be too lazy to take the necessary steps, and are simply going to pay their taxes. The government isn't going to be losing more money than they'd have to spend.

Though I do thing Bitcoin has such a massive headstart that it will be 'king' provided no massive bugs in the code. Just like TCP/IP wasn't neccesarily the *best*, but it still won.

Actually we don't. We borrow them from the Fed with an interest rate. Also if a corporation is large enough it can borrow directly from the Fed at a lower interest rate than the American government. So yeah. That's a thing.

Wanna know what's funny about this? Huobi is the highest right now (381). All the Euro/American traders are overreacting and driving the prices on 'their' exchanges even lower than the Chinese *and the Chinese are the only ones directly dealing with a 'ban'*. Huobi gets notice that its bank account will be frozen soon, and the OTHER EXCHANGES get their price hit hardest. Seriously I have no faith in 'murica. Good thing Bitcoin is there for me.

Many nations are in crisis because of this very issue. It's cheaper to say, buy Coca-Cola than fresh water, and they aren't allowed to collect the rain themselves. Don't have any links for you but it's quite disturbing.

If you like the USA, you shouldn't leave. If you like the Apple ecosystem, you shouldn't leave. I'm just drawing a simple analogy here. You claim Apple is not like a government because you can't opt out of a government and I'm saying that comparison does not prove your point. On the same note Apple certainly takes advantage of the legalized use of force. For example,

Ease is not relevant. gizram's argument is that the response one can give to a corporation cannot also be given to a government. This is simply not true. I should hope changing one's citizenship would be a tougher decision. I am thankful (in general) people do not identify with their iPhones as vehemently as their nationalities. Some iFanboys would have me wonder though...

It's funny. Some people here seem to think bitcoin is actually in danger. This is an eyeroller at best. And as far as 'doing something' goes, doesn't continuing to save up my bitcoins count as doing something? I think the ideological base for this thing is way too stable and the community way too avid for some mainstream media FUD to be able to hide the truth for long. Bitcoinwisdom --&gt; Bitstamp (longest history) --&gt; 3day time interval --&gt; logarithmic scale --&gt; relax. You should have EXPECTED a crash like this, based on past patterns. Seeing HOW the crash occured is to me nothing but entertaining.

It's fine, because Bitcoin will end up percipitating change in the social rights we agree upon.
Edit: Social rights we agree upon == laws (in this case).
So bitcoin will end up percipitating change in (or altogether new) laws. We have already seen this happen all around the world. It is also changing how banks view themselves (see the Fed's symposium on Bitcon.
This was not some plug for anything, or a rip on anyone. I was simply stating a fact. How can you people downvote facts? I have no faith in humanity.

I was under the impression they were stuck in a catch 22, where they can't actually do that and they have to keep purchasing our debt. Otherwise American customers can't actually afford to buy their products.

If you don't like what a (first world) nation's government does, simply stop giving them your money (i.e. go claim citizenship somewhere else). Seriously I wish people would stop using this argument.
