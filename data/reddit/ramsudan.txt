IMO a convenient blockchain-able phone will increase adoption rate greatly
@_date: 2018-05-08 23:38:50
I believe it's solely that.

"If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their Fathers conquered.... I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies.... The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs." -thomas

At this point there will be no block rewards for miners but transaction costs will be paid to miners. It's 100 years from now. You and I will be dead by then and who knows there might be improvements, innovations, new ideas on Bitcoin Blockchain.

Cost savings through automation using smart contracts which are legally enforcable in certain state.

By people, he meant government..which is equally bad idea. He might do good for people but what about next president , next president and next president.
@_date: 2018-03-24 01:28:05
It's deflationary because it's scarce you dumbass
@_date: 2018-03-30 14:35:51
Remittances and settlements for starters .
@_date: 2018-03-31 00:54:39
Excuse my approximation. I didn't know the exact date so 100 years sounded a long time to me. I m baked mate
@_date: 2018-03-31 00:50:51
You won't be sad, you d be dead. But don worry. humanity won't be using today tech tomorrow. But I d be dead too

I invested when Bitcoin was 11000$. I am patiently waiting. I could have sold when it was down. But I didn't. 
@_date: 2018-03-01 02:40:12
So the system is designed to make us poor and encourage spending?
@_date: 2018-03-31 00:52:23
Good idea mate. I ll start working on it. ��
@_date: 2018-03-30 15:47:07
Yea adoption needs to happen 
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:32:59
Only invest what you are willing to lose.
@_date: 2018-03-24 01:30:40
The code is open source dumbass. We don't trust the devs but we trust what we see. And if they try to do left and right, the whole world will know. Go to GitHub and find Bitcoin code and see it for yourself
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:41:16
It's very hard to say. Ultimately the decision is up to you. But my recommendation would be based on history, it is supposed to go up. I am down too but I m keeping it.

Here's a link. Ignore all conspiracy things but this is how money started . 
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:30:31
Same with banks too. The economy will crash if everyone tries to get gold for their cash at same time coz cash is backed by gold and banks don't have enough gold to back the cash they put out due to fractional reserve banking bullshit.

Hey thanks for updating me. I guess this is what we do nowadays. Economics is complicated.
@_date: 2018-04-26 23:26:03
So as a ECON graduate, can you visualize how deflation economy would work 
@_date: 2018-04-20 23:51:43
Damn serious bro. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 17:21:22
Use ABRA. They are best. Not only can you invest in cryptos, forex is  also there. Only problem is you can't withdraw other coins but you can withdraw bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-04-22 15:42:46
Try some p2p websites. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 01:16:38
Thanks for the info. I don't understand why current economy was designed like this. I don't know how it will be more egalitarian
