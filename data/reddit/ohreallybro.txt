Can anyone provide some real information on cloud mining with HashFlare? I've watch some videos and whatnot and I think overall it is the best route for me to go about mining right now. Looking to purchase 20 TH/s at a 1 year contract. Profitability looks good and break even looks fine based on current price of BTC. I'm interested in hearing arguments for/against cloud mining. Thank you!

All of my buddies used to shit on it. I have a gchat from 12/2013 "Bitcoin dropped half its value overnight" to a buddy was invested or thinking about it. He got in at around $600-800. Here I am now eating crow haha.

You can get cucked by GBTC real fast. I’m just hodling it but I bought it at a much lower premium.

This is the only place I really trust that people know what they are talking about for bitcoin so I'll ask and looking for some real advice. Can anyone provide some real information on cloud mining with HashFlare? I've watched some videos and I think overall it is the best route for me to go about mining right now. Looking to purchase 10-20 TH/s at a 1 year contract. Profitability looks good and break even looks fine based on current/future price of BTC.

Nice. Unless you have experience you'll possibly get rekt at some point. Just hodl and buy the .01 you need to get to 1BTC.

@_date: 2017-12-06 20:17:38
Try educating them a little bit on WHY you invested in BTC. Do they share your vision? Can you get them to see it? I'd only suggest to HODL and explain. Doubtful they know how to buy and sell BTC so you just might have to deal with them annoying you for awhile.

what is all?
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:56:48
I bought 20 shares of $GBTC at $125 and the volatility was too much for me. I sold all at $120 after it was up and down like crazy for a couple days. Costing $2500 at the time now worth $47,260. Just hodl. Always fucking hodl. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:03:14
I don't think that's it. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:12:40
I'm in a similar spot. My 1/3 moon is 3x my student loan debt and then I'll pay off just the student loan debt and hodl the rest. I'm betting on some alts as well to help out. If this is you're moon do it. Personally I'm thinking big picture. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:51:41
I believe them. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 05:00:00
How much does it hurt when you are massive one day and then rekt the next? I just hodl it but still. It hurts sometimes.

Just looking back at some dates and conversations with friends. On Dec. 18 2013 BTC lost half it's value overnight due to BTCChina shutting down deposits. $1200 the week before down to $500's on that day. Coincidence? Probably not. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:12:24
It will come back. Best of luck making that quick buck. Every time I've tried to do that I've gotten rekd.

$300 back then could be a lot if you bought BTC when the iphone 3g was released or even a year afterwards. It's probably worth every effort you have to find it. Reward is far greater than the risk of looking.

@_date: 2017-12-07 15:44:07
I'd like to know as well. Looks like significantly increased volume -- at least on GDAX. I remember looking over the last couple weeks and it was like 24-25K BTC and the last 24 horus is pushing 70K.

I own $BTSC and $GAHC. Doing good so far. It's pure spec/betting in penny stocks. $GBTC is the big one! I sold way too early. Should have gone long. The price swings are insane. Have fun. Only invest what you're comfortable losing.

A year from now you're going to wish you started today. 
Some data to back that up - BTC Price:
6/28/2018 - $6,104.69
6/28/2017 - $2,574.79	
6/28/2016 - $647.00
6/28/2015 - $249.01
6/28/2014 - 596.55	
6/28/2013 - 94.65

Welcome. It will probably take it awhile to clear on Coinbase. I'd say eventually transfer it to GDAX which is Coinbases Exchange that you can use your login to get into. Buy a Trezor/hardware wallet, Transfer BTC from GDAX to Trezor/hardware wallet and basically hodl. If it dips buy more. "Never have less Bitcoin than you have right now" - @_date: 2017-11-28 16:33:20
I got in as a long term investment. I have some personal goals in mind that if BTC ever gets up there then I'll think about converting some into FIAT. Biggest goal is to rid myself of student loan debt.

You'd think so. I mean she offered so I don't really need to go behind her back. I like being married.

Also need some arbitrary price predictions by the end of 2017 and Q1 of 2018. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:19:18
Converted my 1 BCH at $634 the other day. Missed out on converting it to a higher amount of BTC . Oh well. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:56:15
Did you get that Rishard Matthews notification too?
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:59:33
I don't.
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:18:33
After this last weekend I'm good right now. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:48:16
Just added to my position this morning. Movin' on up.
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:38:50
I actually was really looking for this one. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 06:02:13
What a guy.
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:49:18
My father in law said the same thing. Said the guy who panic sold everything at a HUGE LOSS in 2009. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:21:29
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:34:17
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:03:29
I always wondered this too. Let's do it. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:26:33
My crypto portfolio is now the same value as my roll over 401K was when I started investing in BTC. I could get into more details but it skews the numbers a little because I added $GBTC to my traditional IRA to be able to get my hand on more BTC in some fashion or another (premium was low when I bought). In March I owned 20 shares at $125 each. I got scared and panic sold. I own less of it now but I just hodl everything. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 02:53:29
I was hoping I'd be one of them :(
@_date: 2017-11-15 02:48:45
Just rebooted my old Square Cash account and I don't see any ootions to buy. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 18:22:42
The app served its purpose for me as an extreme newb through the Bitcoin Cash fork situation. I feel a lot better about having my BTC secure with a Trezor now.
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:49:41
A thread last week was like "Hey guys, I bought today, so be prepared for a huge dip!" And then BTC went down all weekend to the mid $5ks. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:45:26
What has Facebook done for you lately? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:52:09
Was it from his cousin in Zimbabwe?
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:29:34
I'm ready. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:55:06
Just being patient and dca
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:13:50
Like tonight maybe.
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:31:47
It's a couple hundred bucks in the grand scheme of things. I bought all the way down thinking it was the lowest and actually missed the bottom
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:47:01
You got lucky. Hopefully you don't get rekd next time.

@_date: 2017-11-15 16:14:40
You'll eat the fee but just buy it back. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:18:32
It will show up in your account in 8 days, which I personally think is ridiculous but whatever. From experience it does not get pushed through earlier. I used electrum, a software wallet, for awhile but got a trezor recently. I recently went the route of securing everything properly. Do what you feel is right to protect your investment. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 07:08:27
You don't have to buy a full coin.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:10:26
They can't see the vision, boy they must be out of focus
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:32:17
I exclusively hodl. Not terribly worried. I only bought a small fraction of BTC. Trying to get to the 10.5 million club. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:29:54
Dollar Cost Averaging. Not buying it all at once.  Google the strategy. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 04:15:18
Could country of origin be the reason the way it's spelled?
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:40:52
This is a horrible idea. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:22:02
My mom uses the ellipses constantly. No need for it after every sentence. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 07:37:16
They have plenty of money
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:14:45
A good time was Saturday night. Or Yesterday. I've bought at all levels and am now green on everything. Be the price point you want to see. Personally? I'm looking to purchase 1.2 coins in the next 6 months. I'll use the technique of "Dollar Cost Averaging" and get there eventually. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:39:39
You're causing it!

Just realized what this was. Thank you!
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:26:27
Me too! Will buy the next one too. I usually don't have this kind of patience but it's working out well this time. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:43:56
Me too. Trying to DCA but don't want to miss the next drop down. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:48:40
I had a similar one set. I'll leave it just in case. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:54:55
hodl i think.
@_date: 2017-11-24 07:16:40
Still trying to get mine out of Electrum
@_date: 2017-11-03 06:48:23
I'm waiting to get another half. Soon though. 
@_date: 2019-06-20 04:01:04
The way I have looked at BTC from the start is that if we are going to much higher numbers what's a couple $1,000 difference? I'm talking $50,000, $100,000 or even $1mm. You either believe or you don't. I believe and I'm willing to take the risk. Don't put in what you can't afford to lose.
@_date: 2017-11-07 13:28:18
Every asshat in the tech world says ping. Moving in the slack direction now though.

Maybe it was Putin that texted him. Going by his alias -- Cliff.
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:33:54
I bought at $6800. Obviously an opportunity to buy more. I'm not good at timing any buy, sell, or converting. Buy Now, or wait until morning? 
@_date: 2017-11-06 07:26:52
Because they can. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:20:01
Electrum was fine for me on Android. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:46:58
$5500 looked pretty good
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:45:48
My wife offered me some of her severance money to buy the dip. I gotta take her up on it right? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:04:16
$500 - $1000 swings should not bother anyone anymore. It's just what it is. I bought .11 this morning at the high and I'm red like $200 on that buy but ridiculously green overall. Dollar cost averaging is your friend. Don't put in what you can't afford losing. 
@_date: 2019-04-25 06:33:38
What if they were paying them for services?
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:27:37
TBH I think mine went up.

Touche salesman. We don't know a lot about OP's friend but it would have still been some trying times to see the rise to 20K and then all the way down to $6K.

Like why you left your glass of water on the night stand instead of putting it in the dishwasher before you head out to work. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 19:44:17
It's because there wasn't any buyers at that price. They were not able to fill it. Your limit and stop were too close together. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 16:09:01
It just ended.

Right in time for the Fall ratings.

I'm not sure to be honest about better ranges. If you trade with "Limits" on GDAX there aren't any fees.  
@_date: 2018-03-12 22:29:52
Only if you want to claim your losses my dude. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 02:46:54
I’ll live to see another day my dude.

@_date: 2018-02-08 05:18:18
Your coins cleared instantly??
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:11:41
I think that was kind of made up after the fact. It's actually a misspelling from a forum post back in the day. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 23:33:50
I'm interested as well.

It was the dude who explained everything-- Giacomo. Did you even watch it? 
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:01:28
Hi Olga -- are we able to get prior transactions coded back to it's original coding? I've made some purchases before Coinbase re-coded my Chase card to show as cash advance and now all my purchases will now incur massive fees. No notice on this is NOT ok. Chase says you can go back and fix the coding for purchases prior to announcement. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:12:15
Maybe he’s gay tho
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:17:14
He obviously has more. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:54:13
he just dropped HODL. haha
@_date: 2018-02-06 21:39:55

@_date: 2018-02-06 23:30:40
Agreed. In the US I feel like we see heavy selling late afternoon into the evening. We'll see. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 22:18:02
Tell him to stop being a fucking asshat and read a little. I'll edit with a link. 
edit:    There you go. Have him really listen to it. Ultimately it's FUD from like 2013. Hopefully this helps.

I know this isn't but what does your entry point look like? 
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:37:07
What is our general consensus? 
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:13:19
Will it though? If you've been a long term hodler aren't you still pretty pleased at a 9K price point? A year ago was $1k.
@_date: 2018-02-19 19:27:00
Are they private?

We just passed the “If You’re Happy and You Know It Pattern”
@_date: 2018-03-20 18:08:08
Maybe he should have sent a small amount first to be sure that the transfer goes through. After it has cleared send the rest. TBH Kraken probably did him a favor through the downturn between October and now. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:57:46
literally got strait up fucked with the split situation and the recent correction. i'm hodling but it's painful. I monitored all day and there seems to be support at $12-13 against current BTC prices.   
@_date: 2018-02-19 18:34:12
Kit car? Pass. That like the BCASH for Lambos. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 18:50:35
I just started working at a company that doesn't match. Could you enlighten me on your process? I'd super appreciate it. Do you take like 10% of your salary and buy BTC at whatever the price is? 
@_date: 2017-10-30 00:51:53
My father in law was like oh yeah you should take it your initial investment and let it go. I was like nah I'm fine. I was like I'm actually buying more.
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:13:36
No news yet. Just life.
@_date: 2018-02-17 23:58:31
Learn from me. I panic sold and am down .75 BTC and about 30 LTC. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 13:42:53
Do you have your own app? 
@_date: 2018-02-23 03:56:24
bruh come on. i'd tripple tap your mother for 5K price point. most people that invested at 18K and have already been shook out but would die to get back in at the $1000 price point to recover some of their losses. never mind all of the institutional investors who are salivating at the 5-6K range. lol its just not gunna happen.
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:56:54
Thanks. I ended up doing DCA because of that. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 20:11:17
What are the others.... somecoiner and noncoiner?

@_date: 2017-10-31 14:45:08
I'm looking to acquire a full coin over the next month. I have most of the funds now to almost buy it outright. What is the best strategy with everything that is going on? DCA or all in aka yolo?
@_date: 2017-10-28 23:11:18
What would be the recommended strategy for the upcoming changes? Looking to get a full coin. Buy it all now or half now and half afterwards? 
@_date: 2018-07-09 20:16:37
more like "O, BTC!" you stallion.

I'd like to re-buy at a lower price than I sold for last night. I got shook.  At this point I'm happy to have at least taken a small step back and re-balance my portfolio for the long term. 
@_date: 2018-07-08 14:29:57
Coin Stats has been good to me. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 23:08:51
The HODL meme's really helped me for most of the time. Until they stopped being posted. Then I got shook. 
@_date: 2018-07-05 18:25:02

this is so dumb. 
@_date: 2018-07-03 17:52:46
Electrum for wallets should be good for storing, sending, and receiving. As far as buying I think it depends on your location. Best of luck. 
@_date: 2018-07-23 17:04:37
Back in December I had a better definition for cryptojacking. Not so much at the moment.

@_date: 2018-04-01 04:03:44
Everyone is a genius in hindsight. Literally everyone who owns any portion of bitcoin who thought they could have timed the market would have. If you sold at 9K and bought at 7K (which you still can) you came up. We are in a marathon here, not a sprint. Kick back, buy back in and gain some BTC value and enjoy the ride. Don't invest anything you aren't comfortable losing. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 18:00:57
I felt pretty good about my purchase today. 
@_date: 2018-07-06 21:27:51
I might get shit on for this here but you could buy $GBTC in a traditional brokerage account. 
@_date: 2018-04-07 03:47:40
You should have gotten more love for this

I've had an account for a long time but got into Crypto within the last year. Where do I stand in your argument? 
@_date: 2018-04-05 02:58:24
I bought at $7500 yesterday so I feel u dog.
@_date: 2018-04-03 19:54:50
Similar situation here. Ended up losing .75 BTC in the whole debacle of February 6. It was a very tough lesson learned.

@_date: 2017-07-24 07:22:57

Possibly one of the best memes I’ve seen
@_date: 2019-05-11 17:54:30
@_date: 2017-07-24 05:10:06
So let's say I have 1BTC on Coinbase right now. What is the best wallet to send it to? Let's say Mobile storage? Link is from 2015...
@_date: 2019-05-11 16:49:11
Can someone do me a huge favor and explain this meme? I get that it’s a $9000 thing. Saw it posted a million times between 2017 and now.
@_date: 2019-05-11 17:53:49
Thank you! Clarity. Hopefully someone else who was wondering reads this and finally understands.
@_date: 2019-05-14 04:16:34
I’m always asking myself why. Someone tell me why.
@_date: 2019-05-11 17:09:56
Just looking for some context as to why $9000 and why this meme specifically
@_date: 2019-05-11 17:09:21
I know the meme and I know $9000 I’m not a dragonball z guy
