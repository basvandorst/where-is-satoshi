Ease of use? I think transaction times and ridiculous fees need to be addressed before anything, otherwise even enthusiasts won’t transact with bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:22:21
My 133 sat / byte fee has 0 confirmations after 36 hours. Pretty ridiculous since 133 really isn’t that low of a fee.
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:28:02
I paid 133 sat / byte and my transaction has been sitting with 0 confs for over 40 hours. Just a note for anyone reading this advice, I would probably set a fee at least higher than 133 lol.

They’re already on it. I’m sure they’ll have a non-Chrome based app by then.

The fees and drama are pushing me away from Bitcoin day after day. When I first bought in and saw that fees were under a dollar, I figured that there would still be major uses for Bitcoin and that it could become a major contender for fiat currency some day. I don’t see it becoming a currency at all at this rate, although it is a great store of value and may be good for international remissions (even with the ridiculous fees, depending on the amount being sent). In my eyes, bitcoin has paved the way for a better cryptocurrency to take its place. It won’t happen quickly, but it will eventually be replaced with technology that isn’t from 2008 and can handle more transactions at lowers fees while being more secure. Who knows, LN might change everything but it seems as though it’ll mostly improve transaction processing for merchants who open channels, but not so much for a one-off transaction (eg. Sending some btc to a friend).

Not enough. How much cash do you have?
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:35:50
I sent some RaiBlocks from an exchange to my wallet and got it within seconds. Zero fees. If this is scalable then it truly is the future. Also, it is still even on any big exchanges yet. Still a great coin to invest in based on the tech it offers and the huge growth potential.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:30:41
It seems like the whales manipulating this recent rise are pumping it on GDAX primarily, so the other exchanges are lagging behind a bit while arbitrage takes place.

5pm Central time. This should be interesting 
Edit: 
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:09:56
This. My wallet recommended a few of $400 USD yesterday. I ended up putting a custom fee of 260 satoshis per byte and paid $220. That’s crazy.
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:45:47
This is more worrying than the price dropping due to average/FUD/etc. Had the fees been lower and the mempool not slammed, I wouldn’t be worrying about BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:00:38
Sold 35% at 16k. I got in at the beginning of the year, and it reached the point where bitcoin was the largest part of my portfolio. I’m happy with how much I have now and I’m very much still on the train, but if it all comes tumbling down I’ve secured an amount I’m comfortable walking away with.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:29:10
Lol? Roger is that you?
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:32:44
I sold half my bitcoins at $2100 after we slightly recovered from a 2800-1700 crash. Sad days. I ended up buying it all back at an average of 3.7k per coin. Still worked out great.
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:56:43
Well, you know what they say.. Go big or go home...less, amiright?
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:55:29
Noticed this too.
Highest 24 hour volume I’d seen on GDAX last week during the big run up was 85,000 coins. This week I’ve seen it hovering around 45,000 coins. Today, only 24,000 coins... way less activity than last week.
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:48:43
It’ll never be 0, at least not in the short term. There are still some legitimate uses for it where the demand is created from those who actually use bitcoin to transact.
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:37:00
Lol! At least you can add crypto price tickers to it.
@_date: 2017-08-16 12:25:11
That last part of your theory needs to be checked out, my man. PayPal was around way before bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-15 07:14:15
There are 11 million wallets and that number will continue to increase. Surely some wallets would be found eventually, especially with advancements in computing power. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 08:12:11
RemindMe! 1 hour
@_date: 2017-08-15 07:11:45
I'm not thinking of doing it, simply curious as to how secure a wallet really is. No need for hostility. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 21:32:23
"Interfacing with normies" LOL
@_date: 2017-08-15 07:10:32
Right, but it seems like the words used are from a select handful (at least in the case of blockchain.info wallet) considering mine had 2 multiples in it. On top of that, software intended to bruteforce every possible combination would likely get into a few wallets eventually?

Hey, there’s nothing wrong with taking a profit. You 5x’d your initial investment and walked away, that’s a win in my books. Hindsight is 20-20.
@_date: 2017-11-09 03:26:37
Booby. Lol.
@_date: 2017-11-28 09:31:15
Not saying you’re wrong, but people were saying this at 2.5k just a few months ago. I’m predicting a correction, but I doubt it’ll be more than 50%.

1 million doesn't go as far as you think nowadays, especially if it isn't wisely invested.

But this time is different!!
@_date: 2017-09-16 00:07:50
A couple of days ago the CEO of JP Morgan called Bitcoin a fraud, That, combined with government pressure on Bitcoin in China caused the price to dip steeply all the way to around $3000, which then prompted a bounce back from a huge buy, which this image is implying is presumably JP Morgan buying back in on cheap coins after their statement spread some fear and caused weak hands to sell their coins.

Nothing too crazy about those amounts tbh

But this time is different!!
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:44:51
Look at it this way, bitcoin is up nearly 10% in the past 24 hours. So yeah, if you bought $50 worth yesterday you'd have about $55 today. Similarly, 5k invested yesterday would be 5.5k today. That doesn't happen every day, but you can assume that in a year or two that $50 might be over $100.
It all depends on your financial situation. Is a $50 gain worth anything to you? Not really? Then invest more, but remember to only invest what you're willing to lose.

Care to explain the Visa system?
@_date: 2018-04-24 08:05:08
While I agree completely, and this is coming from someone who has had their PayPal account locked multiple times and put through their shit time and time again, their 6 month hold is really their only way to protect their own asses against chargebacks, so it makes sense to me. I’ve had chargebacks 4-5 months later when I had completely forgotten about transactions, and the last thing PayPal wants is those chargebacks coming in after they’ve locked your account and you’ve pulled every last dollar out. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 08:07:21
I’m gonna go on a limb and say that most payments are less than $1000 and therefore PayPal’s getting the better deal here for most transactions. What they should’ve done if they weren’t such a scummy company is 2.5% or $5.99, whichever is lower.
@_date: 2017-05-13 04:44:08
You need a new btc dealer. I get 4%.. and that's with PayPal sometimes.

Pretty much the same if you're buying/selling from an exchange..

Everyone in this sub was ready for a dip at 1700-1800 a week and a half ago. 
It's all speculation, the best investment is to not try and time the market; hold for a few years.
@_date: 2018-04-24 15:40:19
Oh I’m not defending their action at all. I’m just saying the least they could’ve done is make it a reasonable price.
@_date: 2017-06-15 07:09:23
Can't afford it - spent all my fiat on bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-06-07 07:06:57
Can't you just use your online banking to do bank transfers within the US? Many LocalBitcoins sellers will accept that and you shouldn't need to even be physically present in US to make a transfer.
@_date: 2017-06-06 14:45:09
It depends on when the price reaches 1 million dollars. If all coins are mined up (In the year ~2045 iirc) then it would be 21 trillion. As of today, about 16 million bitcoins in circulation mean it would be around 16 trillion.
