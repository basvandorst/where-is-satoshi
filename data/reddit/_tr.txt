Well the dividend is paid in btc so the usd value of btc doesn't really matter.
5 btc was quite overpriced compared to the dividend though.

The format symbol:number is mostly used in english speaking countries. Most of Europe isn't using it. Just the english speaking part of Europe and maybe some exceptions.
This format exists only for historic reasons and makes absolutely no sense like the imperial system for other units.
Write it as you would speak it out loud. Everything else is just an archaic relict that doesn't belong in the next generation of money.

This just means that it's either SEPA or wire TO the kraken.com Fidor account. You don't need to have a fidor account yourself. If you have a Bank account in Europe, choose SEPA, otherwise Wire.
You can however get yourself a Fidor account but the only advantage is that deposits will show up in your Kraken account within hours instead of days.

Karpeles is still board members as an individual.
According to the foundation blog post Mt.Gox resigned its industry membership. The blog post didn't even mention Karpeles as an individual.
The title is misleading or do I miss something here?

You've sent BTC to a ponzi scheme AND are using a wallet on windows? You have clearly more than one problem ;).
@_date: 2015-01-26 07:46:49
For some peace of mind during the rescan you can check the balance of each address your wallet contains on blockchain.info.
If it adds up to your 500 BTC you're safe.

You're spreading false statements. Kraken and Bitstamp both support segwit, they just use the P2SH wrapped address format. It still is segwit.

Yes! There was an article in a german newspaper about this today: 
SMS 2FA is used by some german banks and there happened many cases of fraud lately. Apparently the attackers were able to get a second sim-card with the same number as the victim. So they received the sms with the code as well.
TLDR: Yes, an attacker can get a new sim card with your number and will receive all sms as well.

Best thing is: If you have an account at their bank (Fidor) as well you can send them money using Fidors own method "FidorPay". This is near instant so it just takes about 1 hour to show up in your kraken account.

The tax mentioned in the article exists to earn taxes from short-term speculation with stocks for example. So when you buy bitcoins and sell them 3 days later with a profit, then you are getting taxed as a short-term speculator.
A miner on the other hand produces something and sells it. He is not a short-term speculator. He acts like a normal business that builds wooden chairs and sells them and is taxed in the same way.
But this rules are just statements from german institutions. No court has confirmed this yet.
@_date: 2013-06-27 15:13:15
Not really. This article refers to taxes on Bitcoin purchases/sales you make as a private person. If you are about to exchange Bitcoins &lt;-&gt; fiat for others as an exchange then you are a money transmitter and need a bafin license, as you need it in the U.S. 
And this license is quite expensive.
 
@_date: 2013-12-31 09:33:03
Great project but I have some concerns regarding security.
If the sms number is the sole security measure then your coins are not safe there.
Attackers have been able to create a second sim card with the same number as their victim to clean out their fiat bank accounts.

@_date: 2013-06-27 13:36:17
The tax mentioned in the article is a speculation tax and applies only on things you buy with money, hold / speculate and sell later again for money with profit.
Mining Bitcoins is nothing like that. You are creating them "out of nothing" and when you're selling them later you are like a business "producing bitcoins". So the profits from selling mined coins add up to your total income which is taxed at the end of the year with "Einkommenssteuer" -&gt; income tax.
In the german Bitcointalk section users raised funds to pay a lawyer to ask him questions like this one and this was his explanation. Here are his other answers (german text):

Even FidorBank has to report large transactions to the authorities. Would make no difference in this case.

That is not secure at all. Hackers in Europe have been able to create a second sim card for the victims number. They would receive the challenge as well.

@_date: 2013-12-09 08:22:00
Dude, every bitcoin casino out there hashes its random numbers with the latest block hash to prove they didn't tamper with it.
Why using something like oil when we have the blockchain?
For the generation of random numbers you should use a dedicated random number generator if you want to do it right.

The downsides:
* Whenever you spend something from that address, the receiver can see all your savings because they sit in a single address.
* You have to be very careful with spending because of the change which goes to a new address by default.
A proper deterministic wallet is way better.
Your best bet is Armory. The paper wallet from armory supplies you with unlimited addresses and offers coin control plus tons of other features.

By "made" he refers to the gains, not to the bitcoins. Miners are not affected by the german statement from yesterday.
@_date: 2013-06-27 10:19:12
first in, first out applies. so it's not bound to the individual coins but to your "balance".
for example:
2012-01-01 buy 100 btc
2012-10-01 buy 20 btc
2013-04-01 sell 20 btc
The gains on the last transaction are tax free, because the 20 btc get subtracted from the earliest transaction (100 btc) even when they are the exact 20 btc you purchased in october.
first in, first out. So all you have to prove is a list of transactions like above, but they will not ask in most cases.

Not correct.
Armory relies on Bitcoin-QT for its network communication. Therefore you have to download the complete blockchain.
You just don't need the blockchain for the offline part of armory because there is no network communication happening.
Anyway: Armory should be your first choice for secure offline storage.
@_date: 2013-06-27 15:46:28
I think the reason this tax exists is that speculation is considered harmful  in many ways and therefor should get taxed. In that way "evil" speculation contributes a little bit to the community. 
Interesting fact: The speculation tax is not only 25% of the gains but includes also 5,5% of the gains for the poorer german east regions (Solidaritätszuschlag) and some percentage is send to your church as well.

No. FIFO is used for stocks since 2005. It is recommended to create a new account for stocks bought after 2009 to avoid paying the new taxes for old stocks.
