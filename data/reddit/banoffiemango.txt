No space in my apartment for a desktop. I mean how would I recover any BTC stored on there? Is it safe than storing in a web wallet?

How does blockchain.info compare as a place to store BTC compared to other online services like Coinbase, or software wallets like Electrum? If I use a hardware or software wallet, can I fuck it up and end up losing access to my coins? What if the hardware or laptop I'm using to store them breaks?
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:07:39
I get that there's no coins technically stored anywhere. So would I need to write down the private keys and use them to restore my BTC if my laptop with the wallet software broke? How is that different to a paper wallet?

I bought at the peak in 2013. Put it in a secure wallet and forget about it for a couple of years, things will look much brighter.

I sold before the dip started. Still holding some. Just wanted to get into a situation where no matter what happens, I've made a very healthy profit.

Well that was exciting while it lasted. I sold 0.5BTC for 120 times the price I paid for it several years ago to lock in profits. Time to put away the rest and forget about it for another few years. Wake me up when the next price spike happens.

Same, but on a much smaller scale. Bought in 2013, sold a quarter of my BTC over the last couple of weeks. It's not a life-changing amount of money, but it's nice to know whatever happens from now on I've made a very healthy profit on my initial investment.

I bought in right before the 2013 crash. Unless you need the money quickly (in which case this was a very poor investment choice) park it in a secure wallet and come back in a few years. Things will look a lot rosier.

Unless they need the money urgently, they should forget about BTC and come back in a few years. I bought in just before the crash in 2013, "lost" a lot of money, held and just sold one quarter of my BTC for 30 times my original total investment.

Why don't I have any? I've been holding in a blockchain.info wallet for years.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:40:25
Didn't realize that existed, thanks.

I don't have a Fidor or Revolut account. Are they hard to get?
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:54:37
Thanks, that's helpful. I'm not too bothered about getting the best possible rate - anything close to the current selling price would be a significant profit given how long I've been holding. I just want to get some of the money into currency I can actually use. I'll look for sellers with good reputations.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:44:26
Thanks. I'd heard that there could be problems with buyers reversing transactions. Is that less of an issue these days?
Sorry for being clueless, I bought in years ago, forgot all about BTC, and now the price has risen the extra cash would come in really handy.

Can I use Coinfloor to send straight to my UK bank account?
@_date: 2018-11-15 13:51:25
Do I own BTC on blockchain.info?
@_date: 2018-11-15 14:29:05
So electrum would be a good choice?
@_date: 2018-11-15 13:58:48
Yeah, that's what I've been through several times and come out without a decision.
@_date: 2018-11-15 14:03:56
What's a better option than blockchain.info if I don't have computing power for full node? Doesn't need to be airtight security, just better than what I have now?
@_date: 2018-11-15 14:23:16
I don't *understand* the links from the panel.
I think the community has a problem here. During my masters, I managed to wrap my head around string theory and quantum mechanics-it's not like I'm some artsy technophobe-but I do not understand bitcoin storage from the resources provided in this sub. Mainstream adoption is never going to happen if these are the best resources available and people are attacked for asking for clarity.
I'm thinking about getting out of BTC despite the downturn in price not because I don't believe it has potential, but because I don't understand how to store it correctly.
@_date: 2018-11-15 13:56:26
Thank you. I keep meaning to move to somewhere else but get overwhelmed by the decision.

Put it in a secure wallet and forget about it until you see headlines saying bitcoin is going up again. Could be days, could be years. Hopefully you didn't invest any money you need to use any time soon.
@_date: 2018-11-15 13:55:25
That's what I did in 2012.
@_date: 2018-02-06 11:06:41
How do you know when it's ended?
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:47:14
This is disappointing, and a part of me is regretting not selling all my BTC back in December rather than just some of it. But then I remember that even if BTC goes to zero and never recovers, I got more than my initial total investment for the portion I sold. It's all free money at this point.
Time to forget about BTC for another few years and see what happens. I'm just glad I didn't sell during the 2013 crash, which happened just after I bought in.
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:43:29
Trading is (a) risky, (b) increases your capital gains tax liability compared to holding, and (c) takes time and effort compared to sticking bitcoin in a wallet and forgetting about it until you see headlines announcing a price spike.
