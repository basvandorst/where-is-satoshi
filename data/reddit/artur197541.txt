Example in exmo: the price BTC/USD is mutch higher than BTC/USDT and korean Exanges where there are no deposits with USDT you can see the price of bitcoin!
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:02:42
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:29:47
This year You will still see the bitcoin above $ 20,000!
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:28:43
If bitcoin falls the others too like you see now!
this is just speculation and panic in the investors to cause this loss in the price of the cryptocurrencies!
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:25:47
And these is why after 12 days later 18-12-2017 we see bitcoin price crash because the investors who had the money inserted into the USDT soon began to withdraw it.
so finances does not know how much money they have because I believe that many of the big investors invest money that government finances do not know!
For me usdt has no reason to exist!
At the end of it all bitcoin will grow even more!
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:08:20
These is stupid. 
And I then say that the USDT is used to lower the price of bitcoin!
As most banks do not work with bitcoin then investors who have bitcoin and want to quickly sell bitcoin for dollars use Usdt!
If all people who have USDT and use it to buy btc then the price of btc would go up a lot!
For me Usdt just came to lower the price of bitcoin and do not make it go up!
If the Usdt did not exist the dollars were few to buy Btc!
And with these the BTC price goes up!

Now at 22-12-2017 12:55 Gmt bitstamp 13729 bitfinex 13121
Just do not see who does not want! Price manipulation by bitfinex and its partners

That he sells everything at once!
To get rid of him!
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:21:55
Do not panic! I say this because what is happening is that investors are pressing the price of bitcoin down so they can buy bitcoin cheaper to then sell bitcoin to $ 20,000 or $ 22,000 when the future bitcoin market opens! Hold your coins or sell if you want, for me i am holding!

Just do not see who does not want! Price manipulation by bitfinex and its partners
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:47:57
You confirm to me that the users in bitfinex are more sellers than in the others!
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:33:35
This question now does not have much reason to exist why i say these, because Have you seen which investors are going to enter in the market for bitcoin futures? And many will enter with a lot of money! 
And think they want to lose money? Of course not. Their loby will always put pressure on some countries so that the bitcoin is not banned to continue making money.
Unfortunately in today's world, money is the rule!
Note: I believe in bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:29:29
keep calm!
This happens every year in December!
Just go and see the btc charts!
Rest assured that btc in February will be well above $ 20,000
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:37:12
I wish you good profits.
Believe that from Sunday you will see bitcoin exceeded the mark of $ 20,000
But beware that there will be big falls too!
@_date: 2018-05-11 14:29:06
I think Mt Gox it has a lot to do with the price drop!
I think it's good they sell in the exanges!
Because the bitcoins not only bought by one or 10 people so buyers will be many and there will not be only one person or 10 with power to manipulate the price of bitcoin!
@_date: 2018-05-11 14:18:56
The only reason is mtgox trustee sell only these!
@_date: 2018-05-11 14:20:45
Yesterday they move 8.000 BTC!

If you have your equipment in the desert you have to spend a lot of money or resources to cool it down!

Good thing now they only have 137.000... In 3 months they'll have sold everything! And then there will be nothing to say!
@_date: 2018-05-19 21:53:23
I think until this September the MtGox coins will be absorbed by hodlers!
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:07:01
I hope so!
@_date: 2017-08-23 12:11:50
I may be wrong but I think the correction they are saying was made yesterday When the price of bitcoin dropped to $3,600 , $3400  I think that in September the price will come to hit $ 5500 and then a correction to $ 4300 , $4500
@_date: 2017-08-18 09:11:06
That's what I think!
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:05:53
My concern is that they hit on their last prediction!
@_date: 2017-08-13 13:48:34
If the person buys bitcoin thinking about the long term, I think it is going the right way! Because I think bitcoin will be used more and more by users and companies! And very importantly the bitcoin lobbies are getting stronger, the more money is invested by investors in bitcoin, the bitcoin gets stronger and harder the bitcoin is replaced by another Cryptocurrency!

And tomorrow is christmas!

You can see Bitcoin at $2800, but $1800 It is a mirage that is not reachable!
@_date: 2017-08-18 09:15:44
The problem is that their customers who invest in bitcoin have a lot of money! And they mess with it all!
I just want their prediction to be very wrong to realize that they do not control bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-11-03 11:32:07
Yes you're right when you say a crash will happen, this is called correction! But crash to $ 1000 dolars forget that dream to you buy bitcoin at $1000! A crash could happen to $5500 $5200 only! After this the recovery will begin to reach the highest price and exceeded the highest price! This has happened since 2009 is the nature of bitcoin!
The more investors buy bitcoin the more difficult the dream of buying bitcoin at $ 1000 will be realized!
@_date: 2018-03-24 22:38:42
That's nice. Sooner or later everything is already sold! The market will quickly absorb the sales they make!
@_date: 2018-03-19 16:08:50
And safer too! Not showing the adress! Thanks!
@_date: 2018-03-22 13:24:48
Of course not!
@_date: 2018-03-19 15:14:29
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:46:45
In this case the feeling is that the people waiting for the price to go down a little more to be able to buy cheaper!
@_date: 2018-03-14 14:03:00
Not a problem! There will be a day when there will be a social network, and a search engine originated by blockchain that will not be controlled by anyone! And goodbye facebook, google and others like these two!
@_date: 2018-03-29 14:19:32
Because there is a large-scale attack against bitcoin and other alts!
Let's see before the end of the year 2017 the visa began to prohibit the purchase of bitcoin with credit cards, The sale of bitcoin by mtgox trustee, Governments to threaten with regulations, The ban of announcements related to bitcoin and other alts by companies like facebook, google and others! You want more evidence than this! That this is an organized attack! They should be organizing themselves to solve the problems in the world like the war in Syria and others!
@_date: 2018-03-18 13:42:57
Of course it affects the price! 
Being present in the eyes of all!
It is difficult investors invest when they know that there is 1% off bitcoin that can be sold at any time!
Against facts there are no arguments!
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:49:30
My thinking is that they want the price to go down and never rise again!
But I believe that if that is the goal they will not succeed in the long run and bitcoin will win!

If the problem is the address showing that I received from my daughter btc is no problem I already deleted the address on the post! In Portugal it is said that he is arrested for having a dog and for not having a dog! It is an old saying spoken by the Portuguese!

For me it's no problem bitcoin always recovers this is normal and will go a little further from 4,900 to 5,400 within 15 days!

This is my idea, I fully agree with you!
@_date: 2017-09-01 14:24:52
For me we are in a new wave!
You just have the deep to $3600 And the bitcoin recovered very fast!
I think it will pass the $5000 barrier and then another downhill to 4000 to $4100 And there the recovery!
@_date: 2018-04-25 11:10:06
Just one more price manipulation! Yesterday we saw the price so high and today It! in which they made the price go up a lot and today are making money to sell bitcoin at a good price! Just one more price manipulation! Only that!
The market is still small enough to avoid this kind of manipulation!
@_date: 2018-04-25 11:36:22
Sorry to inform you, but the price remains low $19.000 to $9.000!

Be calm, pretty calm This is due to Bitcoin Scaling and july, and august Months Where there is a big sale of bitcoin last year was the same thing only this year is aggravated due to Bitcoin Scaling, The price of bitcoin will only rise from September!

@_date: 2017-07-15 21:05:19
If your problem is split Rest assured it will not happen Because The big bitcoin miners Are not interested in mining a coin between 200 dolars or less For months! 
Bitcoin at $ 650 already hurts them, Imagine at $ 200 or less And not knowing if the coin they mined will be the winner! So be fairly calm, Will still happen further declines in the price of bitcoin till August Investors do not invest in uncertainties! From September with more clarification the market will respond positively and then the price of bitcoin will rise!
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:00:50
The problem now is not Federal Reserve and World Elites the problem now is Bitcoin Scaling And the big culprit for the price of bitcoin coming down is bitmain If you can see the charts After the announcement of bitmain The price of bitcoin going down They are only harming themselves If the price of bitcoin is too low they lose a lot of money. First, you will not be able to buy the equipment they sell to mine bitcoin. And per second the coins they mine will be sold at low cost! It was a shot in the foot! It's just greed
