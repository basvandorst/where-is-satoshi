He has gone back on nearly every promise he has made.  SHA256 for primes and zenpool returning to normal or higher payouts does that ring any bells.  Also look at when zenpool took its second dive down, it was about 2 days after hashcoin was announced almost forcing their users to mine hashcoin on the promises that it will payoff.

There are people working on a case on GAW on bitcointalk.org to report to SEC.  It's only a matter of time especially after the zen to hashtaker upgrade.

Difficulty had nothing to do with it.  When the 25 for 1 prime thing happened Zenpool crashed which Josh said was because of negotiations with private renters and after they were done with negotiations Zenpool would be back to normal or higher that never happened.  Second time was when hashcoin was announced and it took another dive to the point where you had to mine hashcoins and hope that Josh's promises of $20 per coin was true so you could make ROI.

I think the accounts who basically say GAW can do now wrong are fake.  Moderators of HT are leaving left and right and since GAW deletes all negative posts if someone's goes there before buying and not check any where else they have an extremely biased and controlled view point.  If HT was a book it would be called 1984.

I had not a single problem signing up for circle and buying bitcoin from them.
@_date: 2014-12-12 21:54:29
I don't remember who but they came on this [post]( and voiced their opinions of GAW.  One of them was even a reseller and got banned from HT for voicing his opinion.

"I am in the process of renegotiating the contract between us and our largest private buyer. The payouts will likely drop to near other multi pool payouts, while I finish the negotiation. Once that is done, they will likely return at a higher rate then before!"
[Zenpool Fluctuations](
This is what he said after it dropped the first time.

Coinbase is reporting price at $450
@_date: 2014-11-27 23:43:53
I checked last month and it said it was down for maintenance then, so I think that website is pretty much dead.
@_date: 2014-12-12 17:53:54
This needs to be reported to SEC, this is starting to get scary.  Lots of people are going to be hurt by this. 
@_date: 2014-12-10 23:38:28
We actually got Josh to answer this on bitcointalk.  He says he doesn't feel the need to release that information, which means to me he doesn't have as much as he says does.
@_date: 2014-12-12 18:59:42
I think as a community we need a public way to start documenting everything that is going on with GAW and a way to get it to the masses.
@_date: 2014-11-26 22:19:16
Everything he announces is to change something forever but the problem is so far nothing he has done has changed anything.  All the hashlets are not profitable and if you buy one now you will be dead and it still not close to roi.  
@_date: 2014-12-03 20:45:06
SHA256 wasn't implemented because zenpool was paying so low and at 40ghs per prime everyone would have switched to SHA256 to have higher payouts.  Zenpool is not back to the normal .0006 or higher payouts like he said they would.  
@_date: 2014-12-11 14:45:01
Thank you sir.
@_date: 2014-12-11 14:25:19
GAW will screw you at every turn they can.  Even some of the HT moderators have left because of the way GAW is ran and some of them have been banned from HT for just voicing their opinion.  
@_date: 2015-01-02 23:55:25
He won't come.  He's said why should I have to face obvious trolls meaning I can't moderate and control the AMA.
@_date: 2015-01-06 02:20:32
Lol, sorry I was talking about the coldpi not the trezor.
@_date: 2015-01-01 23:15:49
Yes... Yes... C++ I understand none if it.  ELI5 please.
@_date: 2015-01-18 17:57:53
There was an error when they tried to get their first days payment from Josh's bank account and were told to put in a support ticket.
@_date: 2015-01-02 23:49:06
I have this archived and the actual post of this archived so if it gets deleted it's all archived.
@_date: 2015-01-06 03:11:13
That's all we hope for as a community.  First as a community we need to take care of all these scammers and build up trusted websites.

Why is he even allowed to speak since he says btc isn't viable.
@_date: 2015-01-05 22:12:07
At current btc prices that's $163 which is just ridiculous.  Raspberry pi - $35, 8gb class 10 sd card - $5, Power cable - $4, Case - $3.  That's the cheapest parts I could find.  Time to setup would maybe be half a day and it's not portable like the trezor.
@_date: 2015-01-03 00:20:00
This is excellent news.
@_date: 2015-01-18 18:20:38
Here's his official reason why he didn't show up
" we exchanged emails at about 5 am. I am leading the team working on more market depth. Customers would rather us do VS talk"
@_date: 2015-01-03 00:28:14
Archive I'm working on of things Josh says that turn out to be lies.
@_date: 2015-01-05 23:55:15
.6 btc to usd is $163 based off what Preev is saying.
@_date: 2015-01-01 20:50:15
Don't forget to also edit the peercoin code so it said paycoin.

Josh here's a [gift]( for jail
@_date: 2015-01-02 23:52:20
Go hear   
Created and account with the same email as your hashie.co account.
Then fill out that forum.  
Takes them about 24 hours to transfer and they are still working on payments, but that should be fixed soon.
@_date: 2015-01-23 20:34:47
There were gawtards posting it was them on hashand now hashtalk is down.  This is not a coincidence GAW is scrubbing the forums of all the posts so they don't get in trouble.
@_date: 2015-01-23 21:19:56
All this is quite fascinating to say the least.  I can't wait to see this all play out and it appears that hashtalk is back up so they were not hacked.
@_date: 2015-01-04 06:28:37
You mean Hash Korea. 
@_date: 2015-01-18 17:29:32
Ha.  Can't wait to hear Josh try to spin this one.  
@_date: 2015-09-01 11:46:54
I probably should of put telephone wire instead.  
@_date: 2015-09-01 02:55:16
Uverse is through good old telephone wire DSL.
edit: changed cable to wire.
@_date: 2015-02-04 20:53:19
Honestly do you think Josh's lawyer came up with the buy back idea?  I think he said that to not hurt his reputation anymore, even though I don't think it could get any worse.
