I think he means from this point on, rather than literally 'putting it on github and not talking about it' sense.

Did people necessarily understand the reason they were using gold thousands of years ago? Not really, there was just an underlying economic incentive to use it as a means of indirect exchange. The same will happen with bitcoin.
Fiat inflation and capital controls will eventually drive people to bitcoin, and rightly so - it's a superior money.

Great comments, I think the argument here is that hoarding will help bitcoin value rise. That rising value will then cause some bitcoiners to spend their coins, which can help propel merchant adoption 
@_date: 2014-01-09 02:47:52
probably because we need something in the mean time / to help transition over
@_date: 2014-08-20 14:00:52
the trouble here is the underlying sellers (as in, customers of btcmarkets.net who use it to sell) who are considered as 'operating a business for tax purposes' - they will now need to charge GST whenever they sell BTC. So under the current tax laws, they'd have to either eat the cost, or pass it on. 
Meaning, any Australian who wants to buy bitcoin is given the choice of either: 
* finding a NON-business to buy bitcoin from
* using an overseas based bitcoin exchange to buy
* doing untaxed / off the books transactions via things like Mycelium Local Trader or Localbitcoins
Or they 'bite the bullet' and pay the 10% GST to buy...
@_date: 2014-08-20 12:18:50
hold on doesn't that only speak to sale of bitcoins - it doesn't say that individuals buying bitcoin in australia don't have to pay GST on the PURCHASE. From my reading of the guidance page and this page: 
I think individuals (even those not running a business) buying btc from australian exchanges will still have to pay GST

"According to an interesting study of the 775 fiat currencies that have existed, 599 are no longer in circulation. The median life expectancy for the defunct currencies? Fifteen years. Perhaps the author was being unfair by focusing solely on the failures. Sadly no, the average life expectancy of all fiat currency is running at a truly underwhelming 34 years. Only a select few have managed anything approaching old age." - from

Begging the question, the point in contention here is the political authority of the state. Does the state have the ability to unilaterally create obligations on other people to pay it? (even if those people don't want that state provided service, they would prefer a voluntary service) secondly, does an individual ha e the right to do this? Most people / common sense would say "no, they don't have the right to do that" 
That is the double standard applied by people in favour of the state. I've just given you a brief sketch of the outline, see Michael huemers "the problem of political authority" for more details and answers to other objections.

Guys I think this article is sort of overstating the level of regret Jim actually has about bitcoin. I've seen a bunch of his interviews and he tends to be very humble in the way he talks. I've seen him use the expression "if I was smarter I would have done x" and so on. Now I'm a huge bitcoin fan myself, I'm just saying this article and title is probably drawing a bit of a long bow 
@_date: 2014-07-20 03:59:28
the article addresses that type of concern: 




@_date: 2014-08-21 00:51:15
Yeah you might be right, but either way it's massively more work and compliance. Eg both parties have to now issue a tax invoice and then there's the issue of not being recouped for some time which can be a liquidity concern 
Edit: also even as a pass through, where is the hypothetical Australian based bitcoin payment processor going to recoup that amount? From their btc sell side of the transaction? But Presumably anyone in Australia who wants to buy bitcoin will instead buy from overseas to save paying the extra 10%...

you have not substantially engaged with the argument presented - which is that money is ideally the universally accepted medium of exchange. All other things being equal, a more liquid/saleable currency is superior and will beat out inferior money.

I suspect it's because merchant adoption (and subsequently people spending their bitcoins) is outpacing bitcoin hoarding. Be patient, some combination of asset bubble deflation / capital controls / cyprus style bail ins / high inflation will eventually come, and that will spur people to hoard bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-12-22 05:19:41
I agree with the sentiment (that they're really trying to control speech and control us in general), but they could respond by saying even fiat money is money on a database somewhere (only 7% exists as cash/coins), and that's regulated too. So for them, this isn't really being inconsistent 
@_date: 2014-08-20 14:21:17
I'm still very bullish on bitcoin in general, I just don't think it's likely that we'll see good business uptake of it in Australia in the near future anymore. the "double GST" issue is too much to overcome for an above-board business. if they're doing under the table business with it, sure - but it won't be a mainstream thing to do this in the near future.
bitcoin will win because it is a superior money, the govt can only slow it. it can't realistically be stopped now

I would suggest we have to analyse things ceteris paribus (i.e. "all other things equal"). Just because we have fiat now and people are richer, does not mean we are richer because we had fiat. 
We might have gotten richer through other means e.g. capital accumulation, technological advancement, entrepreneurs competing for labour pushing the 'price' (wages) or working conditions up. 
My advice here is: we need an economic theory separate to the situation at hand, so that we can tell whether things got better as a result of the state, or they got better *in spite of* the state.

it might not be sinister, I hear the payment processors actually sell those coins to 'dark pools' rather than on the open exchanges. So perhaps some of those people who bought them from the dark pools want to cash some money out.

Not quite, the libertarian would argue here that there are many ways in which the government has caused more people to be poor in the first place. 
examples: 
* fiat money system (which only exists in its current form as a result of government) steals value from some and transfers it to others 
* The government also prevents the poor from helping themselves, with onerous rules and regulations e.g. minimum wage law which hurts the poor

So using your logic then, the state 'had a chance to prove itself' until jim crow racial segregation laws were ended, and it failed (up until that point). Therefore, there was no civil order? 
I think a better way to look at it is, analyse it a bit further down rather than just purely looking at what system it was - look at what sort of outcomes come up when you have people with more economic freedom, versus what outcomes when you have people with less economic freedom. 
There are many examples of anarchy working better than you might think. Here's a recent book by Peter Leeson with some great examples 
@_date: 2014-08-20 11:57:55
hold up, I think on re-reading the examples in the more detailed guidance, the business actually gets to claim that GST back as an Input Tax Credit. See example 3 (Paul), and combo that with example 1 (Karin) 
Edit: actually sorry I think i've miscalculated - the business is still net worse off, as while they are able to pass on the GST cost in one case (the transaction where they sell the item to the customer, and get an ITC to cover it), the other transaction (if using a payment processor) will cause them to incur a GST cost that they aren't getting reimbursed for and can't pass the cost on of. 
So I stand corrected, I think you're right caveden, this really is a showstopper
@_date: 2014-08-20 14:30:26
that's only the exchange part. What about the merchants who want to accept BTC? the "double GST" issue will destroy any economic incentive they might have had and make them net worse off...

No it's not necessarily govt fascism, these are legitimate business/internal controls that help to ensure the business runs effectively. I'm ancap myself, and I work in internal audit in a private sector company - you're making out like these controls are all run by the govt, they would not. They would theoretically be run and put in place by the business themselves. 
The corporate world requires internal controls to properly run the business, and also to give comfort to outside investors and individuals about the trustworthyness of that company. These internal controls do not necessarily equal the government.

You can, but you can't do it on the mass, forced scale that governments managed to wean the world off actual money (e.g. gold, silver) onto fiat. It was only under the *overall system* that this became possible:

Ok so to explain what I mean: 
1. central banks of the world are helping to enable massive credit expansion of fiat currency e.g. the US Fed Reserve is doing this by expanding the monetary base. 
2.  Now while it's true that the velocity of money is extremely low these days, and therefore the monetary base is not necessarily being translated into increased money supply YET - this is not to imply that money supply inflation will not be the eventual result. I can't say when this will occur, just that it will eventually occur. That is, unless the US Fed Reserve manages to pull the reserve/base money out, which at this point is pretty much impossible to do without letting interest rates surge, in which case the US govt risks being insolvent. And yes, I get that the US govt will  never truly go 'insolvent' as it has a printing press, but then obviously if they print their way out of the debt that will definitely devalue the currency. 
The Federal Reserve is painting itself into a corner because even when it merely talks about the possibility of tapering its QE, the market went haywire - imagine how bad it'll be if they actually did taper! and this is just tapering, not even removing the monetary base from its lofty highs. 
  - compare Fed Reserve Balance sheet of $869 billion vs a prospective Fed Balance sheet of $4.1 trillion (assuming a mid 2014 stop of QE). As far as I can see, there is no escape for the Fed / US govt. In the long run? It's either go bankrupt, or keep printing money - it's just that most of society has not yet realised this. 
If you disagree, then I'd like you to explain how it is even remotely possible that the US govt will pay off $120T in  unfunded liabilities.

It's an interesting point, but do we really know for sure that this whole DDoS, sell at the top and buy at the bottom strategy was their intention in the first place?

Either way, now that exchanges are hardening themselves against DDoS, this is a great positive for BTC

This is probably just a usability problem, I think it will be solved by market actors stepping in and creating online webapps and smartphone apps that are dead easy for everybody to use. They would explain the bare minimum required to make it work, and may even assume some of the risk for loss of coins so long as appropriate security is taken (they might in turn get insurance against this risk, to actually pay for it).
That said, to some extent people will just have to learn and understand how it works - in much the same way that people moving from snail mail to email had to understand the very basics to even be functional.
In terms of our focus though, Bitcoin adoption will start more with the techy / libertarian people first and slowly move through to the old grandmas etc.

That won't work forever, as eventually [hyperinflation]( happens. It has happened in the great majority of paper money scenarios (eventually), and I see little reason why it will not continue now. 
The central bankers and politicians claim to be on top of things and be wary of inflation, but in reality they kind of paint themselves into a corner because they can't keep their spending in check. For evidence of that, see [US Debt Clock]( Eventually you'll start seeing them saying stuff like "Well sure, we realise that real wages are falling but attempting to bring inflation back down to target rates would risk derailing the economy".

I think at least initially, the big players in each market won't be offering you a discount to pay via Bitcoin as it will cost them some money to set up their websites to take BTC payment.
Also the very volatile exchange rate of late means that the benefits of the deflationary nature of Bitcoin won't be that apparent to them - we'd need Bitcoin to be bigger and have more infrastructure (ability to easily short, or enter into forward contracts / futures) for the value to stablise.

Put simply - central banking to continually inflate the currency/money supply is not necessary. Under the Austrian economics school, it is generally held that the GFC was caused by malinvestment due to too much cheap credit in the economy (which was caused by interest rates being too low) - misdirecting the funds into poor investments. 
When the government debases currency (by causing money supply inflation), the people who benefit are the ones who get to use that money first. Why? Cos they get to spend those dollars *before* they lose purchasing power. As these extra dollars circulate through the economy, the prices rise and everybody loses real dollar value (as opposed to 'nominal' dollar value) because of price inflation. So who is the winner in this system? The government, and whoever gets those funds first - because they get to spend it at *yesterdays purchasing power* (which is higher than today's), while us average folk have to bear the brunt of the loss in dollar value. 
So in a system without central banking inflating the money supply, I think it is actually a fairer system because the average person does not lose value just cos they aren't the govt, or the people the govt gave the money to first. With Bitcoin, everybody gets to enjoy the the increased value or 'purchasing power' of the Bitcoin over time.

I think shutting down every single BTC exchange would be practically impossible though, look at how successful the government was at shutting down all the file upload sites, or even torrent websites like the pirate bay.

re: buying at the 'high' of the curve - I believe Bitcoin is going to be a "Boom or Bust" scenario. It will either be worth $100k+ per Bitcoin, or the whole thing will come crashing down (perhaps some newer better cryptocurrency will be invented). So I wouldn't worry too much about whether you bought in at $40/BTC or $70/BTC, either way you'll either be very rich in 5-10 years or your bitcoin investment will be worthless - it's an all or nothing bet.

Yes that's correct those coins are lost - however the other coins will just appreciate in value over time to compensate so it won't be an issue for the overall bitcoin economy. 
As an example, imagine someone bought all but 1 BTC from the system - I think we would still be able to function using this 1 BTC, we would just have to move the decimal place to make it more practical (do a software update).
@_date: 2013-04-27 04:56:55
Sure there is an incentive to not spend bitcoins, but in certain cases this is outweighed by other factors driving bitcoin buying/selling: 
* Evading capital controls (which will only become more restrictive over the next few years as govts become more aggressive about taking people's assets / fruits of their labor)
* Person who wants to protect their value vs inflation e.g. Argentina
* Remittance market - sending money overseas to family
* Person who wants to buy something and not have it show up on their credit card e.g. the husband who doesn't want his porn subscription to show on credit card
* People who are not 100% certain bitcoin will be worth 10k/each - which I daresay is most people. So why not cash some out or buy some things with it now to 'lock in some gains'?

@_date: 2013-03-24 11:01:59
Sure, great point. I would respond though that yes the price may be bubbling, it's pretty much impossible to know for sure. 
I think for Bitcoin to truly become widely accepted money in the world, it would necessarily have to experience periods of extremely rapid growth as more and more 'waves' of people learn about it and start to use it. And given the limited supply, the only way more people can get into it is for them to buy it, pushing the price up further and further.
tl;dr: bubble or legitimate value? It's almost impossible to know. I just point to functional advantages to identify this as a paradigm shift with great value for humanity in terms of enabling free market globalization.

Consider it a 'long shot', where a small bet now could potentially make you very rich in the future. The target value of bitcoin is something like $100k to $1M per bitcoin (if it ends up taking 1% to 10% of the world transactional currency market). See Rick Falkvinge's article [here]( 
This is a 'boom or bust' / all or nothing type bet, so consider your expected value accordingly and consider investing, but only a small amount that you can easily afford to lose.

even if you don't have enough to buy a full BTC, buying half a BTC can still end up getting you $50,000 or $500k - so this shouldn't really stop you investing. 
think of it as Expected Value = (success price) x (success probability) - (opportunity cost of the funds you would be using). If that is positive, then an investment in BTC is a smart decision -so long as you only invest what you can afford to lose. obv you have to make the success price and success probability estimate on your own.

1. **This is a disruptive innovation and is not just a change in product, but requires a shift in business model** - You're correct that Paypal/Ebay has a lot of resources - but right now Bitcoin is a disruptive innovation. It won't eventually prove to just be a better product (against which Paypal could try and compete against), it is an *entirely different business model* and also an *entirely different way of looking at money* (e.g. email is not just a faster way to send snail mail, it is an entirely different way of thinking about communication). Paypal face the innovator's dilemma of either embracing the new technology (and drastically changing their business and firing many many employees, remember these big companies have a lot of bureaucracy, internal politics so it can be hard to make these 'bet the farm' type moves) or keeping their business model as it is (but then losing out to Bitcoin/whatever cryptocurrency replaces Bitcoin)
2. **The problem of fiat currency** - Even if they were able to magically re-engineer and downsize their business to compete against Bitcoin - they'd still be dealing in fiat currency (for example of a failure in this case, look at Kodak who invented the digital camera but did not embrace the new business model because they made money selling film). The deeper lying problem with the current system is that central banks cannot be trusted to not inflate the currency. Current fiat money is not sound as people who own it lose purchasing power of their dollar - we are seeing the first signs of stress in places like Cyprus, PIIGS. The USA, Euro and Japan central banks are all rapidly printing money, devaluing the currency. Once the dominos start to fall, people everywhere will look to more sound forms of money e.g. gold, silver, bitcoin (because it is decentralized and cannot be inflated beyond the algorithmic rate).

Bitcoin will actually become a great leveller, in a similar way to how the internet was a great leveller (giving everyone the ability to easily communicate with the rest of the world). Currently, the banking and government system helps entrench some of the rich in their positions. 
Now, with Bitcoin, barriers to entry for so many industries are being blown away - allowing the little guy who can provide a good service, a chance to do so without unnecessary red tape and bureaucracy.
**tl;dr Bitcoin will most likely help raise the poor out of poverty, as Bitcoin will enable free market globalisation.**

While a decentralized exchange would be awesome, I don't think it'll happen soon enough to realistically help the Cyprus situation via Bitcoin. 
I think even though capital controls are being imposed, Cypriot people can just slowly withdraw money and move value over to Bitcoin through local exchange. 
tl;dr - there won't be any quick, one shot solutions here, it'll be a slow gradual move to safer value storing methods (rather than storing value within the Cyprus banking system).

you're right - perhaps it's not the fractional reserve system that helps the banks currently, but rather the huge regulation/compliance burden that props up the banks now and entrenches them in their current position vs other competitors/new entrants into the market.

You're missing the 'root cause' of inflation: printing money.

You do realize that the modern finance theory is based on the idea that the price of a stock should theoretically represent the amount that company is worth in perpetuity (dividends + capital gains)? So there is nothing inherently wrong about people buying Bitcoin because they think it will rise in the future, that is how markets normally work...
@_date: 2013-04-19 04:26:30
For all we know it could drop to $30 tomorrow, or it could go up to $266 again and crash - the important thing is not the price, but the concept of digital, decentralised money and the network effect.
If you're investing, be prepared for massive volatility - a common theory going around now (which I kind of agree with) is that we'll see 'hype cycles' where the price dramatically rises up, then crashes to a price floor, with each price floor being higher than the last.

I'm not talking about the short run here, talking about the medium to long term. Why would people keep using a currency that loses its value over time when they have other options? Also, we're at the relatively early stages now but you can see that capital controls are on the way for USD - look at the FATCA act coming in for example. Owning a currency with currency controls placed on it is suboptimal and will not likely be a sustainable long run option.

Yes there will be other products/currency trying to compete but I think the network effect (see some of Peter Surda's writing here) will keep Bitcoin popular. 
So my point with investment is - don't worry about buying in at a high now, if Bitcoin becomes truly popular the value of each BTC may well skyrocket up to $1k or even $100k/BTC given the scarcity (only 21 M BTC ever).
@_date: 2013-04-09 12:30:13

@_date: 2013-04-06 03:53:39
While I don't doubt that 'cryptofiat' may be attempted by governments, I doubt 'cryptofiat' will ever become as popular/effective as bitcoin, for these reasons:
1. It can be inflated centrally - therefore individuals who do not want to have their purchasing power eroded will not want to use it
2. Now that Bitcoin / decentralized internet currency is out, the 'genie is out of the bottle' so to speak, I think once the market really catches on to it, they may not necessarily want to go back to the old system of centralized control. 
I agree with your idea that we will probably have multiple competing cryptocurrencies, however I think the biggest players in the 'currency market' will be market-driven/decentralized ones as opposed to government-driven/centralized ones.
@_date: 2013-04-23 10:57:51
I guess they could attempt it through some combination of the following: 
* Banning any shop from publicly accepting Bitcoin for payment
* regulating the bitcoin exchanges (this only works if the exchange is situated in that country) to put in AML/KYC regulation 
* restricting the ability of individuals to transfer money to exchanges - thus limiting their ability to enter the BTC economy. e.g. closing down any bank accounts that are known funding entry points for a BTC exchange
Whether this would actually be effective though, is a different story.

@_date: 2013-04-28 01:00:25
I think they realise that making Bitcoin illegal would not achieve much, people could use it in other countries (or simply continue to use it, albeit illegally) - and there's nothing stopping people from analysing the law that made it illegal and simply creating a new cryptocurrency that sidesteps that law. The 'genie is out of the bottle' with cryptocurrency, it is here to stay.

Absolutely - and re: accountants and lawyers freaking out, don't worry there are ways to make it transparent on the business end.

@_date: 2013-04-16 22:16:18
I like the analysis, I think it'd be a good idea to focus less on the price and more on take up of the actual underlying BTC network transactions / acceptance by merchants. This will spur true growth rather than bubbling up and down. 
That said, I expect there to be more bubbles to come. If you're investing, best to buy and hold for long term - timing the market is a fool's game.

So many people point out Tulip mania - the difference is that Bitcoin has functional advantages over any other currency in the world. 
1. decentralised with no central bank who can debase the currency against your will
2. pseudonymous (potentially anonymous if you take the right precautions)
3. MUCH lower transaction fees than anything western union / paypal/ visa / mastercard can do
This is a paradigm shift in money.
@_date: 2013-03-20 07:33:49
Yep that's that article! 
Ok I'm a bit uncertain if the compelling advantage you mention is really all that compelling - as an analogy, nowadays we buy 'general purpose' computers, but we still have to upgrade them every few years anyway (otherwise it just runs too slow if you're trying to run new software). Could I then argue that there is a 'compelling advantage' for software makers to just never utilise the latest and greatest processing power so that people on older machines can still use it? I'm open to any more arguments or examples you have, but I don't think the incentive is as strong as you think it is. I reckon it'll just be competing cryptocurrencies, and as the market expands for each, specialised equipment will be made towards each type of proof of work algorithm - in much the same way as you might go hunting with all manner of different weapons specialised for different purposes.
My guess is that in the future we will see competing cryptocurrencies, but the market will really only have enough 'room' for 2 or 3 big players, and the rest will be small fry. Kind of like how in the social network space its Facebook, Twitter, G+ - all the others are small fry.

Actually, during roughly the mid 1800s to around 1900 there was great economic growth while the world was using gold as the main form of money. 


I would really recommend reading the book, I found it very interesting - I'll write a quick response here but I won't be able to explain it as well - I’m not an expert, just an enthusiast. Anyway, this really depends on what economic framework you view the world through. If you are a keynesian, then sure, your solution to this problem is more government spending as 'stimulus'. If you are a monetarist then your solution will be along the lines of having low interest rates. However the austrian and classical british schools of economics don't suggest 'govt stimulation' or creating artificially low interest rates. The austrian school in particular talks about how the keynesian (and more 'mainstream') analysis focuses too much on broad aggregates like GDP rather than on the effects down at the individual level - as inflation necessarily distorts the ratios of 'value' that people hold e.g. 1x = 3y = 10d = 32a etc where the variables represent different goods/services. Also the distortion of interest rates downwards (and this is only really possible with central banking and a govt backing this whole system through law/force) causes investors/entrepreneurs to believe that people do not require much compensation for use of their funds (e.g. low interest rates means people are more willing to let their funds be used cheaply without high compensation in the form of high interest rates). So consequently entrepreneurs/investors enter into investments that 'appear' to be profitable but are really not because interest rates were just being held low. This creates capital misallocation and creates asset bubbles, which is a problem that cannot be rectified (i.e. return to 'true' market level) so long as central banks / govt 'prop up' these high prices. The key idea here is that interest rates represent a ‘ratio’ between desire for current consumption versus future consumption, and government central banking ruins that ratio, throwing the very means of analysing profitability over time, out of whack.


This part is more around the notion that - when the govt / central bank start to purchase more and more of the bonds market (because private money don't want to get 'return free-risk' because of an expectation of future inflation e.g. see Mish's blog post today which is [quite relevant]( So eventually the government / central bank has to keep purchasing more and more bonds, creating more and more paper/elastic money. So while velocity might not be high right now, that money will eventually circulate through the economy, and there is not really an easy way for central banks / The Fed to suck it back out since they will be funding the govt's expenditure and they can't really do both at the same time (i.e. fund the govt, AND stop printing money). 


Actually, I think you'll find most Austrian economists reject the efficient market hypothesis on the grounds that it 'goes too far'. While it is true that at the margins, people generally are economically incentivised to do things like arbitrage and price new information into the market by buying/selling appropriately - it is their view that the Chicago School took that concept too far with the EMH.


So here: 
1. It depends what economic framework you use, as in the austrian framework it is savings and investment, not consumption (or aggregate demand in the keynesian framework) that is most economically beneficial. 
2. I think making this type of argument is completely ignoring time preferences. I need to eat dinner tonight, not in a month’s time when my money is worth more! Also, look at many industries like the electronics/technology one -&gt; it’s easy for somebody to say “oh I won’t bother buying the iphone5 cos the iphone6 will be out soon and that will be so much better/cheaper!” but you have to buy a phone eventually. So businesses still need to compete based on satisfying customer wants, and if anything it means they will compete harder for our business as consumers in a deflationary environment.

See peter surda's recent blog posts (on mobile can't easily link it, will edit this post later). His theory goes against yours because of a concept called path dependency. Essentially, it's kind of like how we use QWERTY layout even though it's not the most efficient. 
Any new challenger to bitcoin would have pretty much need to have a commanding new feature that truly distinguishes it and gives the market an incentive to switch. Until then, bitcoin's network effect will probably win out.

I'm reasonably confident people will find a way around it - whether that's through international wire transfer via many different intermediaries set up specially for that purpose, or a Ripple-type exchange. 
Also, some people might even 'close the loop' by getting paid in BTC, and buying things directly in BTC. These people may end up acting as conduits for BTC to enter a country and sell BTC to other people via in person transfer.

we have to be careful with statements like that, there is definitely  incentive (on the part of both individuals and merchants) for it to achieve widespread adoption, but we can't say for sure. 
I think the smart way to approach it is something like: 
(success probability) x (success price of BTC) - (opportunity cost of the funds that you are thinking about investing)
tl dr; in my opinion it is overwhelmingly worth at least a small gamble if you can afford to lose the funds, but every person must make their own assessment of the success price and success odds
@_date: 2013-04-18 12:59:15
Disagree for these reasons: 
* I don't think it's accurate to suggest that people aren't enthusiastic about new retailers accepting Bitcoin, those posts are consistently getting upvoted, and people are referring their friends/wives / buying things themselves
* 'The greedy' will not be able to manipulate the value of Bitcoin forever, it actually costs them money to do this and with the coming collapse of the fiat currency system (US govt in huge debt, Euro countries in huge debt, big central banks printing money like mad) we're going to need some way to transfer value - it might as well be Bitcoin or some kind of cryptocurrency that succeeds Bitcoin.
* People do not 'hoard forever', they hoard with the intent to spend in future. Savings is simply delayed consumption.

I think the key point you make is that expanding the monetary base does not necessarily mean expanding the money supply. However, this much expansion in the monetary base will eventually lead to high inflation, once loans are generated based on that monetary base (banks have a strong incentive to loan/create money, as it is one way they can make big profits) 
Also, as governments get into greater and greater debt, they run out of options and eventually they are left printing money to support their spending. Of the major economies / world reserve currencies, I think Japan is closest to this situation. Abenomics is truly destructive and will not end well.

one way they could act as a local BTC buy/sell conduit is even just buying a BitcoinATM and putting it in their store. From what I understand they'd make money from the bid-ask spread. Not sure of details on how the pricing of Jeff Berwick's bitcoinATM works though.

* easy way to move funds in/out of bitcoin, currently there are too many hoops to jump through - e.g. more bitcoin ATMs would be awesome

I didn't say the *companies* it could disrupt, I was referring to the *markets* it can disrupt. And I don't mean it like a straight 1:1 comparison (i.e. not saying "oh if Bitcoin disrupts the $10B payments market, Bitcoin will be worth that 10B") - it's more a general guide.

PayPal face what is known as "the innovator's dilemma" - there's this new disruptive technology that is threatening to eat their lunch, but they face a tough decision because if they do adopt Bitcoin it cannibalizes their current product and would require a complete shift in business model.
tl;dr - they're pretty much never going to accept Bitcoin and it will end up being their downfall
@_date: 2013-04-02 07:46:40

even then, I really don't think the government is going to go for the outright ban, the FinCEN guidelines indicate that they're leaning more towards regulation rather than outright banning
@_date: 2013-05-02 23:38:44
That's not accurate in my opinion: there is a huge difference because by buying things with bitcoin we are supporting the bitcoin economy. This helps encourage other merchants to accept BTC payment. 
e.g. if we see news like "BitPay did $5M revenue last month" or "Amagimetals sold $750k this month" -&gt; that news encourages other merchants to take up BTC payment.
@_date: 2013-04-12 11:07:35

@_date: 2013-04-21 00:49:35
This is a good idea, and I think we should also be emailing our favourite online businesses to accept bitcoin - the barriers to accept it are reduced if they just use a payment processor. 
Another consideration: Rather than asking "Do you accept bitcoin?", maybe we could try "When are you going to accept Bitcoin?" - esp. so with online businesses as Bitcoin is becoming known as 'the internet currency'. Once any one of their big competitors accept Bitcoin, they will have a strong incentive to also accept Bitcoin - apply that market competitive pressure.

diminished confidence in the USD as a world reserve currency may lead to decreased ability for the USA to just pay for things by issuing debt -&gt; implying US govt will not be as easily able to pay its debts. We may start to see more wealth confiscation / currency controls / capital controls type tactics. 
Based on this series of events, it's likely that people may not necessarily 'flee' USD into renminbi, but also to store their value in things that cannot be centrally inflated / confiscated e.g. gold, silver, bitcoin

@_date: 2013-03-24 09:01:11
Yeah that's a great point - I'd just add that we have literally never had a decentralized cryptocurrency before in history, so we're in uncharted waters here. These factors make it very hard to perform analysis based on fundamentals like we can do for stocks.
@_date: 2013-03-27 13:19:17
My logic here is that we currently have nothing even close to a free market. What we actually have: Government entrenching the rich and entrenching certain corporations at the expense of newcomers (e.g. hitting them with massive regulatory compliance burden, or high minimum wages to stop them being competitive). This does not create a truly free market competitive environment. 
The reason I believe bitcoin will help solve this problem is because bitcoin will enable entrepreneurs (and the consumers of their products) to sidestep government red tape/regulation through conducting businesses online etc. This will create a much more equal opportunity for the poor to work (by expanding their reach globally, e.g. now a programmer in India can work for someone in the US/Europe and get paid easily in BTC), or to start online businesses (and not have them be subject to massive government red tape/bureaucracy). 
@_date: 2013-04-02 07:46:09

Analogise it to mainframe computers and the desktop PC being invented (bitcoin is like the desktop PC - you can be your own bank) - and I think odds are that once there are better solutions out, more people will do this rather than relying on the centralised solutions eg banks.

To be fair, the current system is moving towards one with zero privacy anyway! Prism and all that, plus all the disclosure requirements ramping up and many transactions traceable. So in this scenario at least bitcoin can't be centrally inflated and has cheaper transaction costs

Obviously we can't say for sure, but it would be hard to come up with something that was significantly better (and also could not be implemented by bitcoin developers). Think the reason why we still use the qwerty keyboard etc

You raise a great point, however: If they were using a zero exchange rate risk service like what BitPay offers, then they didn't get hit that hard, and won't be in future. Customers can pay in Bitcoin, and the merchant receives fiat currency in their bank account for a 1% fee (much cheaper than what they're paying for VISA/Mastercard et al). So in fact, they actually still have a strong incentive to accept Bitcoin.

I think BIPS also offer a similar service

You will find that many people who are ideologically aligned with bitcoin for libertarian reasons, tend to be those people who believe in the idea that the profit motive is a positive thing for society. The reason is that being profit motivated encourages us to serve our fellow men and women in a way that efficiently uses resources to satisfy consumer demand. 
In this case that may mean providing liquidity / initial market cap to enable bitcoin to be useful to bigger and bigger companies.

See ["But there is no inflation: misconceptions about the debasement of money"](
tl;dr: "Present policy is making it ever more difficult to stop printing fiat money in the future, or to even stop accelerating the creation of fiat money in the future. That is why, if we keep pursuing current policies, we are heading towards paper money collapse. Present inflation readings do not change that."
@_date: 2013-09-02 03:26:36
No worries mate, here's my response
1. Germany has already recognised it as a private currency so first up, it's hard to argue that governments will come out and ban it. Also from what I've read the government of Canada hasn't exactly been hostile to it. 
2. Even if USA/China/Russia banned it (or tried to really heavily regulate it to the point of zero use/value) - there are plenty of countries where the laws may not be so strongly enforced e.g. African nations
3. Even if every single govt in the world banned it (extremely unlikely) - people could still use it as part of System D - the world's unofficial economy which is still huge, see the link I put in the post. 
In relation to the hundreds of thousands of people - that's a guess I've made based on the number of online wallet sign ups at blockchain which is around 415k. There are also many other online wallet services, and many people could also have non-online wallets. So based on these factors, I don't think it is an outlandish claim.
Next time, try attacking the argument and not the person - it hurts your credibility otherwise.

I don't know for certain, but my hunch is that Bitcoin's network effect is becoming stronger and the 'virtuous cycle' some refer to is really starting to spin up. We're hearing all sorts of reasons for people to be taking up Bitcoin:
* Lots of media attention from big news channels / websites
* People a little scared/wary of fiat currency being either directly stolen or indirectly through purchasing power of their dollar being eroded through inflation -&gt; storing value via BTC, or using BTC to evade capital controls
* payment processors like Bitpay taking on more and more merchants, doing more and more business each month. 
* price rise -&gt; market cap rise -&gt; more and more businesses can start considering Bitcoin for large transfers e.g. if BTC = $1/USD, then it's kind of hard to do any kind of $22M USD transfer for a company, but as the BTC price climbs and ownership of BTC is more evenly distributed out (rather than concentrated in the hands of a few people), this becomes easier and easier
* more and more businesses accepting bitcoin or signalling their intent to accept it in future. I think also, you will find that once one big player in a given industry starts to accept it, other companies in that industry feel more forced to do it or lose out to their competitor's competitive advantage. e.g. 9flats accepts BTC, I would not be surprised if airbnb accept it soon too - to help remain competitive.
* VC attention and stated intent to invest in bitcoin startup businesses
* reports of fund managers contacting that fund in Malta (Exante iirc) looking to invest some serious money in Bitcoin

My hope is that over the next few years, the bitcoin economy builds up and becomes a parallel economy that enables (at least some) people to preserve their businesses, jobs and livelihoods through a recession. Governments will likely do all sorts of terrible things over the next few years as we see currency/banking crises e.g. the Cyprus bail in, confiscation of people's wealth, other totalitarian state type tyranny. Bitcoin is one way for people store their wealth and peacefully conduct business and trade.
The value would go up since we would see big user adoption of cryptocurrencies and/or gold/silver. And no, 'hoarding' isn't bad - it entirely ignores the concept of time preferences. 
1. Nobody would go to a coffee shop and say "hah! those idiots, don't they know that coffee will be $2.90 tomorrow instead of $3 today?" - there are some types of consumption that we can't easily delay. 
2. There is only consumption and delayed consumption (savings). So really, even if more people started saving money this only alters the composition of demand, not the amount of it. e.g. if more people save, then entrepreneurs are just more incentivised to make longer term or capital goods rather than short term consumption goods.

Few options:
1. Mt.Gox - you'll have to wait through the verification queue to fund it properly, I hear it's over 9000 so it'll take a while
2. Cash over the counter deposit at banks - using services like omnicoins.com or spendbitcoins.com (the fee is a bit higher with these sites, but they are fast and easy to use). You fill out the online form with your BTC address, they give you a quote and a fiat bank account to deposit to. It must be done via cash deposit only.
3. Try find someone to exchange with on 
tl;dr - use Option 2 for quickest and easiest option (you will pay highest fees this way though)

I think you're going to have to reconcile these two statements. Ultimately people going down the path of saying 'deflationary = bad cos people won't spend' ought to realise that people can't just sit on their stash of money forever, they do actually need to pay the bills and buy food etc eventually. So there is still a clear incentive for them to spend money.
@_date: 2013-03-27 12:16:18
While that's true, it may also be a case of - once all the infrastructure has been set up for the first big cryptocurrency, it is easier to set up for newer ones. e.g. once a merchant starts taking one type of credit card, it's probably not that much harder to take a second type of credit card etc.
I don't think BTC will necessarily capture 100% of the world transactional market, but it has a shot to take a reasonable portion of it - with other things like competing cryptocurrencies (maybe only room for 1 or 2 more big ones), gold/silver, and some small percentage of fiat money all in the mix.

Well my theory is that even though the USD may eventually fall, it most likely wouldn't happen all at once - I think it will just slowly but surely lose its value relative to other currencies. So gradually, once people realize they are just losing way too much purchasing power from their USD, they may switch to other options like gold/silver/bitcoin.
tl;dr - it won't happen all at once, it'll be a gradual shift

I'm of the opinion that: 
* Once the infrastructure is in place to handle one cryptocurrency, it becomes easier to accept others.
* I also believe that the current 'internet currency' market is not large enough to support more than one big player. In the future, this may not be the case. 
* Though it is true that generally speaking, alt coins should have a point of meaningful differentiation -&gt; I could see a scenario where having a second crypto-coin might help if the primary currency network was down or some other unforeseen obstacle arises e.g. If another 'Fork Monday' situation happened, we might need an alternate cryptocurrency to use while we wait for the issue to be resolved.

I’m suggesting that the whole reason for these artificial paper booms in the first place is the central banking system and government support of this through force/law! So whether the currency is deflationary or not, people will price that into their long term models - as I’m sure they did back when the world was on gold (note the government supported gold standard is different to being on gold in a free market sense). The main thing that should be avoided is these artificial paper booms e.g. dot com bubble, recent GFC / sub prime. 


I believe the error you’re committing here is the same one I mentioned earlier of keynesian/mainstream thinking in terms of aggregates - rather than the individual effect on prices and the relationships between prices. These relationships are much more complex and cannot be analysed through such coarse aggregate analysis - it is down at the individual level that we need to look to see the detrimental effects of constant money supply inflation. Detlev steps through some interesting thought experiments (starts simple, and then slowly relaxes certain assumptions to demonstrate the effects) in the book Paper Money Collapse here and logically shows how this distortion occurs because of money supply inflation. He explains it much better than I can so really just have a read of it.


When you say inflation here, do you mean price inflation or money supply inflation? 
Either way, price inflation or money supply do not necessarily lead to a ‘true’ economic growth. The constant rising of the world’s stock markets this year (coupled with the decrease in the purchasing power) is a great demonstration of this. 


If you’re suggesting the ‘Volcker solution’ of eventually having high interest rates - many governments of the world would go bankrupt if this were to happen.  just for e.g. US national debt is almost $17T, unfunded liabilities are around $120T but tax revenues are around 2 or 3T per year. If interest rates were even 5%, how affordable do you think that is? And if anything, Japan are in even worse trouble than the US. 
The problem with what you’re suggesting is that the central banks of the world are a tool needed by their govts to fund massive spending. They can either keep the interest rates low (but effectively end up printing lots of money), or they can let interest rates rise to their true market level - but govts would default if this happens (so obviously it won’t happen). 


I think they’re taking exactly the opposite path to what they should be doing (i.e. not print so much money, not spend so much) to allow the market to actually remove the distortions and asset bubbles. So we are pretty much in polar disagreement on this, but if anything Japan will be an excellent test case. If Japan’s economy recovers and does very well over the next few years, then you will be proven right. If Japan’s economy continues to fail, then I will be proven right.

Interesting points, my response:
1. some people might manage to 'close the loop' and get paid in BTC, and buy services in BTC, thus not needing an exchange anyway.
2. re: the US crack down on online gambling and online poker - I think this Bitcoin situation is somewhat different because with Bitcoin people can always do in person transfers to buy/sell BTC. You couldn't previously (not easily at least), go and pay cash to load money onto an online poker site. 
3. Once big hedge funds, banks, or possibly western union etc get into it, they might even lobby the govt to keep it legal
@_date: 2013-03-18 05:03:31
I think you should steer the discussion more towards services that offer zero exchange rate risk (i.e. they just get paid straight in USD) - this makes it simpler and you don't have to deal with their objections about Bitcoin being a 'scam' or whatever else they think it is. Right now you're just getting bogged down in unnecessary debates.
edit: see here for [Coinbase]( "instant exchange") and I think [bitpay]( does the same

I believe the plan is to eventually raise the hard block size limit over time, so that may also act as a downward pressure on transaction fees. 
Also with the recent mining pool that almost hit 51% of the mining power, they voluntarily agreed to reduce their hash rate, so perhaps there is hope an arrangement can be arrived at to limit transaction fees. 
Either way, I'm not overly concerned as the Bitcoin economy/community has come this far - I think there is a v strong chance we come to a workable solution that doesn't hinder Bitcoin's growth potential. And even failing that, some smart cookie somewhere will come up with a new cryptocurrency solving the issue - the 'genie' truly is out of the bottle now.

This is a huge misconception of how money works. The money can simply be made 'more valuable' and in terms of not having enough physical tokens of gold, don't forget there is also silver and other precious metals. 


No, it was not a 'hack' it was more or less the result of politicians wanting to remove the restrictions on their own spending (backing the USD with gold acted as a restriction on govt spending). It was either that, or horrible understanding of the concept of money. But obviously it draped in some kind of 'patriotic' language i.e. when he took the USA off the gold standard, Nixon would have come out in 1971 blaming bogeymen like 'speculators' and 'the chinese', when really the true culprit for devaluing the USD was it's own govt and monetary system.

Yeah I think it's really about tailoring your sales pitch to the person. 
* If it's a person into austrian economics / libertarian then definitely use that libertarian angle. 
* If they're just a regular business owner, then push the no chargebacks and extremely low transaction fees angle. Also the ability to accept payments from any country (Paypal barrs approx 60 countries, and there are some that VISA/Mastercard won't touch either).
* If they're into tech, maybe push the cryptography and tech angle
* If they're working overseas and sending money home to family overseas, push the "you can send your money back home safely and cheaply" angle.

1. these days with smartphones I doubt it'll be a big deal, you'd prob just scan a QR code and the amount (with an approx USD/other currency translated amount) displayed
2. re: menu costs, well I guess shops can either do electronic display of the BTC price (so it's easy to change over time), or alternatively display the prices in fiat but then do the BTC conversion at the very end when you finally pay. Either way, I don't foresee this becoming a big issue
3. edit: just adding one more - this most likely won't be a 'snap' changeover from fiat to BTC used in real life stores, it will be a slow and gradual shift over.

It's a mindset thing - people can just as easily convert $30 of their local currency into BTC and then purchase it immediately, so no this is not the major issue. The major issues facing Bitcoin are more about ease of use, ease of getting it, and merchant acceptance.
@_date: 2013-09-02 01:56:49
I believe we have to distinguish between 'deflation' in the deleveraging sense - as in, the kind that happens after an unsustainable expansion of credit/debt which we colloquially refer to as 'bubble popping' e.g. 2008 GFC. This kind of deflation only occurs because of prior government manipulation of the currency/banking markets e.g. fractional reserve banking, lender of last resort, deposit guarantees (implicit or explicit), bailing out banks. 
On the other hand, Price deflation in a sound/hard money environment is a good thing for society because it means people can now buy more for less. It would be awesome to get everything we want for free, right? Clearly that's impossible in this world of scarce resources, but deflation is the next best thing.
@_date: 2013-04-04 13:45:26
While I do agree with the concept of the Sunk Cost - I don't think it necessarily applies here. It's not a sunk cost as you can sell off your initial investment to ensure that you're never in a loss position. Sunk Costs refer to situations where you can't actually get that money back e.g. a meal in a restaurant that you've already paid for and will not get a refund for.

Is log growth really the best way to represent bitcoin price? I think more important factors are merchant acceptance and general user acceptance/understanding.

my opinions on this are:
* I think bitcoin is going to be a 'boom or bust' scenario, in 5 years time bitcoins will either be extremely valuable and used in many places around the world - or they'll be worthless if say, some superior cryptocurrency is invented rendering bitcoin useless. Based on this, I think an investment (only of money that you can afford to lose) is a decent bet. If you're going to make this bet, think of it as something like: (success probability x success price per bitcoin) minus opportunity cost of that money (e.g. interest you could earn on it, or other returns if invested elsewhere). See Rick Falkvinge's article about the [target price of Bitcoin here]( If he is correct, then it won't make a big difference whether you get in to the market at $40 or $70.
* Bitcoin cannot easily be shut down, as it is a distributed technology/protocol similar to bit torrent. Any attempts by government or banks to shut it down will most likely result in it becoming even more valuable - just look at other things the governments of the world have tried to outlaw in the past e.g. alcohol, drugs. There is also the Barbara Streisand effect to contend with here, where attempts to hide info actually makes it publicized more widely, see [here](

I think the 'sell some now and buy back in later' is a risky game to play (you might not be able to buy back in at a good rate, you'll pay transaction fees, you may feel more stress / make poor decisions) - if you're truly in this, then it's probably best to trust in the long term value of BTC = just hold OR buy things via BTC to support the bitcoin economy.

Sure the purchasing power was less after the crash but that's not my point. my point is: the underlying cause of hyperinflationary loss of value is printing too much money. The underlying cause of bitcoin's loss of purchasing power that day was not printing money, as this is impossible in bitcoin (beyond the algorithmic release of bitcoin slowly over time).
@_date: 2013-04-16 12:51:51
While I think you've obviously posted this with the right intentions (to help ensure there is no single point of failure), I think this won't be as much of a problem as Bitcoin currently has with exchanges. 
1. There are others like walletbit, coinbase, BIPS who offer similar services
2. I'm just guessing here, but it seems like it would be easier to 'scale up' a payment processor than it is to scale up a Bitcoin exchange if faced with sudden huge demand

@_date: 2013-04-01 10:40:44
Even then, the way I see it: Bitcoin is an 'all or nothing' type bet. If you agree with my reasoning here, then an investment may still be worth it if you think Bitcoin will eventually climb to $100k or more. You wouldn't even need to buy a full BTC, you could just buy a half or a fifth of a BTC and still get the benefit of some increase in purchasing power.
20x return on your investment over a (relatively) short period of time is nothing to scoff at.
@_date: 2013-07-05 22:26:53
While I think OP makes good points, I think these will eventually be overshadowed by the coming banking/currency crises over the next few years. 
Once the average man in the street realises that his government is debasing his currency like crazy, and that his bank/govt is not afraid to 'bail him in' / Cyprus-style - that's when more people will turn to gold, silver, bitcoin for protection from this tyranny. 
So if you're a BTC investor, all you need is a bit of patience.

Excellent article here, you show strong insight into what the future of Bitcoin holds. I particularly like your point about how for Bitcoin to 'gain value', it's almost like other currencies have to 'give value up'.
I think what you write, kind of dovetails well with Falkvinge's analysis (in his "the target price of Bitcoin" article) of Bitcoin becoming a big player in the global currency transaction market and taking 1 to 10% of that market - i.e. we are on the path to a mainstream adoption of Bitcoin with value per coin upwards of $100k per BTC, just because of the huge scarcity of only 21 million BTC vs 7 billion population. 
@_date: 2013-04-17 10:24:20
Great response! here's my counter:
1. PayPal as escrow service may still get disrupted - see  - escrow might be handled directly by the bitcoin protocol, with use of a private mediation firm (this may be Paypal, or it could be another smaller firm with much smaller overheads/labor costs). Or it could be handled 'off chain' by a private mediation firm. So while there's a chance Paypal fits the bill here, I don't know if it that's the most likely outcome.
2. I agree bitcoin is still a freakshow at this point - but just as I can drive a car without knowing how the engine works, people will eventually come to use bitcoin services without knowing/caring about the blockchain etc. I honestly think this is only 3-5 years away, as entrepreneurs come up with ways to make BTC easy to use.
