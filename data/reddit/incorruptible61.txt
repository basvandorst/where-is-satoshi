I'm a proponent for Bitcoin, but is there something seriously wrong with the echo chamber that exists on this sub? I can't be the only one who thinks linking to secondary news sources like "[8btc.com]( is okay. At least link to the fucking primary source that's on the TOP LINE of the article.
I don't think a single person who has commented here so far has commented anything about the subject matter of this so-called "study". Honestly, to call this little analysis a "report" or a "study" is a farce. It's hardly objective, peer-reviewed, or packaged for public consumption. The overly zealous language that is used to bolster its argument is hardly academic or objective in nature. The people on this sub who are completely blinded (and I mean shitface blinded) by Bitcoin and crypto critically turn off logical, sound minded people like me from wanting to engage in these spaces in rational and objective discussion.

Sure, that’s great, but what’s the motivation behind a lot of kids getting into bitcoin? A lot of it feels like for very immature reasons and they go about it in negative ways that hurt the community, like op’s post. In my community, the same people who are just as hype about bitcoin are hype about multi-level marketing pyramid schemes because they’re solely focused on “get rich quick” schemes.

There's actual valid criticism of the Fed that exists on this subreddit and even in the mainstream. If you watch just five minutes of this video, you'd realize that this falls way off that spectrum and heavily cherry picks data points and/or emphasizes points that contribute to their conspiratorial narrative. Just look at the creator of this video and you'd see that but you're too blinded by the self-selected bullshit you want to see.
