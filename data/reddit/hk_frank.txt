That's 80/40% of what, exactly? Who are they paying and what was the loss? The translation above doesn't really say.
@_date: 2016-08-14 04:40:31
Thanks – I see it now, it'a a company called Huachen Commercial and Trading Co. Ltd.
Here's an article: 
@_date: 2018-01-14 07:57:16
I bet I can guess what they called their dog!
@_date: 2018-01-30 13:34:03
"as per the data received from CoinDesk crypto currency exchange."
- er, what?
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:00:25
Whatever happened to "Bitcoin doesn't care what the government thinks of it"?
@_date: 2018-01-06 22:25:52
That's why I encourage people to do P2P cash trades for newcomers. Current fees make it hard but at least it removes the hassle of signing up for exchanges, which can be a big turn-off to many.
@_date: 2016-06-27 20:47:26
Good job Sam.
@_date: 2016-06-19 01:53:37
Have you heard their show? They talk like that about everyone in the industry, including other interviewees. PB didn't get it any better or worse than anyone else.
@_date: 2017-08-02 21:51:20
There's a direct quote in the article where Wincent says he did it just for fun.
@_date: 2017-08-03 01:56:20
Yeah the general rule (these days) is left-to-right if written horizontally, and right-to-left if written vertically. Sometimes you see old-fashioned signs written horizontally right-to-left. I know it's confusing, but it's Japan and being confusing is what Japan excels at.
@_date: 2017-08-03 03:00:23
Well, he would say that wouldn't he?
@_date: 2017-08-08 12:59:59
Yeah, well if you're gonna put your own dick at stake, conservative is the way to go. Good for all of us.
@_date: 2017-08-03 02:27:44
Here's a handy video from the man himself on how to do that properly: 
@_date: 2016-11-03 20:36:35
Can you point to the part of this article where block sizes are even mentioned? 
@_date: 2017-08-08 22:20:24
The cartoon version of that wasn't as family-friendly.
@_date: 2017-08-03 02:57:57
I think it's pretty obvious by now that "Satoshi Nakamoto" was not one single person. It was a group effort; some are already dead.
@_date: 2017-08-16 21:24:40
Looking very forward to watching the whole thing. Nice work.
@_date: 2016-11-16 01:05:56
It's personal attacks and childish behavior like this we've come to expect from the Block Size Debate. No wonder the mainstream has trouble taking Bitcoin seriously.
@_date: 2016-11-24 07:40:41
Are you saying he didn't say it?
@_date: 2016-11-04 00:31:37
If you're going to make wild and untrue statements then yes, a little sifting might enhance your credibility.
@_date: 2017-11-25 11:31:35
But headline says "just announced" so that's what I'm talking about.
@_date: 2017-11-26 13:03:22
Sorry, I'm old.
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:34:00
BTC-USD trades worldwide, the average would look at the Korean &amp; Japanese exchanges too.
@_date: 2017-11-25 08:07:45
It's not breaking -- here's an article from July saying Revolut intends to support Bitcoin, Litecoin &amp; ETH account balances: 
@_date: 2017-11-25 08:10:36
Not only did you shop at Bic Camera with Bitcoin, you bought a drone and VR goggles. I'm impressed.
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:31:36
Christ, they've done it. They've bloody done it.
@_date: 2019-04-16 23:48:37
That link just goes back to the documents uploaded by "haonho" to scribd, there's nothing saying these documents themselves are the real ones.
@_date: 2019-04-16 23:42:48
Playing devil's advocate here; do we know that this document was actually submitted as evidence? Searching the case number on Google leads back to this scribd file and a bunch of other unrelated material. Then there's the misspelling of Kleiman's name, the term "Australian IRS" (there is no such agency) and the fact that it presents Craig Wright in a negative light. Who wrote this and why?
@_date: 2015-07-06 01:03:41
Buying shares is not the same as buying a bond or lending money, in which case you expect to get back the principal and then some. And buying shares in a startup on an uregulated bitcoin stock exchange, especially a startup in an untested industry, is particularly risky. 
@_date: 2017-04-13 08:16:14
You don't have to pay with bitFlyer but they're the processor, so they're handling the price conversion. Make of that what you will.
@_date: 2019-04-17 00:09:26
Why should I spend money to prove your point? Besides, I'm not the original commenter here, I'm just responding - and that guy said you need a US CC to access PACER.
@_date: 2017-04-14 00:39:41
You can, but it's like reading Huffington Post and Breitbart at the same time. Alternate realities.
@_date: 2019-04-16 23:56:02
I'm not the one trying to prove something, I'm the one asking for proof.
@_date: 2019-04-17 00:04:19
Aaand, fall back to insults while still not proving anything. Onus is on you here dude.
@_date: 2017-04-13 08:19:49
See a video of it in action here:
@_date: 2019-04-16 23:54:22
No, that's just a link to this collection of documents. How do we prove they're the real ones the court is seeing?
@_date: 2016-09-15 00:49:34
Wasn't really a crypto project though, just an exchange. 
@_date: 2016-09-07 07:40:16
It's a dapp platform therefore it would be possible to use any currency on it.
@_date: 2018-03-04 00:29:30
Put away the butthurt dude, I like bitcoin &amp; use it as money (and no-one will stop me) -- but it's not a legal currency in Japan, and that's a fact.
@_date: 2018-03-07 08:54:00
You keep missing the point. I'm not even talking about whether we need govt approval or not (we don't), I'm telling commentators to stop claiming it's a legal currency in Japan.
Your point is valid but you're arguing about something else. 
@_date: 2018-03-03 03:22:03
Guys we really have to stop this meme that bitcoin is a legal currency in Japan. It's defined in the new laws as a "money-like asset" and may be used for payments. It's not recognized as a currency -- I know this is pedantic, but if you want to be taken seriously in bitcoin you need to know your money definitions.
@_date: 2017-09-30 05:25:44
I added you guys to the article ;)
@_date: 2017-09-20 11:46:48
He conned me into buying a bunch of bitcoins for $80 each in 2013.
@_date: 2017-09-05 23:21:21
I live in Japan too, and honestly there could be 100,000 more stores accepting Bitcoin &amp; you might never find them randomly. Tokyo is chaotic, there's even a half-dozen different digital cash systems.
@_date: 2018-02-08 20:56:12
I had to laugh at the suggestion to tell a complete noob to "do a free MOOC and do a couple of pull requests on GitHub" - lol
Most people out there would have no idea what either of those things are, and marketing philosophy says they value/trust things they pay for over those that come free. Weird I know, but true.
@_date: 2017-09-29 22:41:56
Why argue? Everyone could live in complete harmony if we all just agreed with me and my opinions.
@_date: 2017-09-13 04:47:15
@_date: 2017-09-13 00:43:06
Yes so sshhh, let's never talk about that.
@_date: 2017-09-13 00:42:33
There's a link to the site in the article.
@_date: 2017-09-13 05:20:39
I don't think that question was actually looking for an answer.
@_date: 2017-09-29 21:03:03
That's why they now have to have licenses.
@_date: 2017-10-16 08:01:50
Yep it's a trial at Marui department store for Bitflyer. I posted some more pics here: 
@_date: 2017-09-05 23:18:35
Did you go to any Bic Camera stores? They have signs everywhere.
@_date: 2017-10-30 14:44:45
@_date: 2018-02-09 05:11:14
I'm just saying that most people would not to go that much effort, hence it's easier to sell them a complete, pre-packaged course. Likewise, the comment that people place a higher value on things they pay for isn't my personal opinion or even a definer of quality, it's just part of marketing psychology. 
Having said that, the (paid) Blockchain Institute of Technology course actually looks pretty good.
@_date: 2017-10-16 08:06:02
It's funny but I spoke to some staff in the Shinjuku Bicqlo store, where there are literally Bitcoin signs everywhere, and they'd never heard of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-22 07:01:04
This is probably one day we could afford to ignore that topic.
@_date: 2018-02-09 08:37:50
Yeah all that is fair enough (and I actually agree with you so don't get me wrong). I guess the course isn't charging for the info so much as the packaging, for which there's a market -- and as a capitalist I wouldn't begrudge anyone a money-making opportunity.
@_date: 2017-10-31 03:20:44
For the first time in decades I actually regret not watching more TV.
@_date: 2017-10-31 03:22:42
A lot of bitcoiners say they got into BTC thanks to this episode -- including Star Xu who started OKCoin. Not sure how true that all is, but it's a good anecdote.
I got into it myself after listening to Gavin Andresen on one of Leo Laporte's podcasts, which doesn't sound as impressive.
@_date: 2015-04-29 17:47:10
The Bitcoin exchange integration thing is huge. Can't wait for the iOS version, is it coming soon?
@_date: 2017-10-16 08:04:36
They have for a while now -- I tried it out on the second day and it worked... not bad. Here's the video I made of it:
@_date: 2018-04-04 22:43:56
True, but that still doesn't prove he's the one controlling the account at this particular moment.
@_date: 2016-10-19 23:33:35
@_date: 2016-10-05 12:55:56
That explains the DHS contract then, lol.
@_date: 2016-10-04 22:26:19
the usual third-party utility suspects like mouse controls, keyboard remapper, GPGTools for Mail. Unfortunately they're more useful to me than any new Sierra feature. My bad.
@_date: 2016-10-06 06:42:12
CNN: "The hackers stole 50,000 of the well-known white supremacist currency, Bitcoin"
@_date: 2016-05-09 09:06:11
Wouldn't be the first guy in business to waste months of his time on a loser of an idea. For some, it's years.
@_date: 2016-05-02 01:06:32
Yeah probably gonna be a while before we see that, but it'd be a cool experiment for airlines to try. lol at the thought of some passenger getting hog-tied by the crew b/c their transaction never got confirmed...
@_date: 2017-07-21 09:12:05
Thanks! Wow, they certainly could have made that a lot more obvious. A lot of users will give up before discovering this.
@_date: 2016-10-04 10:12:48
Wow, a Sierra feature I can actually use. All it's done so far is break all the utilities I rely on.
@_date: 2017-07-31 20:35:34
Sounded weird that the court indictment gave that a brief mention while the big DOJ website statement didn't mention it at all. Made me think they only used a couple of services in the US, while the main servers were elsewhere.
@_date: 2017-07-28 03:11:34
That's "fark orrf" to you sonny.
@_date: 2017-07-25 01:43:41
Oh FFS.
@_date: 2017-07-13 01:18:25
Apparently he stopped by CoinCenter too. Heh, and still no-one knows this guy's name:
@_date: 2017-07-22 09:22:52
OK, so he's pointing out all the useful things they've contributed. But that doesn't mean you can't get fired if you're no longer benefiting a project. 
btw this is not a stance on the issue, just pointing that out.
@_date: 2017-07-07 06:46:11
Yeah you're right, Ross had nothing to do with Bitcoin at all.
@_date: 2017-07-27 09:52:25
Judging by the language in that DOJ statement and indictment, I'd say anyone who had funds on BTC-e can kiss their money goodbye.
@_date: 2017-07-28 00:34:59
I volunteer to play Craig Wright, I can do his accent well.
@_date: 2017-07-31 20:40:43
That's the internet -- the US claims jurisdiction because it allows foreigners to target US systems and/or citizens from outside. It's the same rationale behind trying to get their hands on Gary McKinnon, Lauri Love, and Julian Assange.
@_date: 2017-07-28 00:19:59
Possibly it's a supercomputer from much further into the future, which sent instructions to 2009 so it could come into being earlier. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 05:53:32
That's Mai Fujimoto - in Japan she's known as "Miss Bitcoin" and sometimes appears on TV talking about it. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 20:36:56
That's true - I think BTC-e is saying the FBI didn't get *all* the wallets though.
@_date: 2017-07-13 01:11:55
If you're the kind of Average Joe who watches Yellen giving Senate testimony, maybe.
@_date: 2017-07-30 01:19:59
They're not concerned about the users! They'd much rather you kept your money with one of their approved, fully-surveilled, banking partners.
@_date: 2017-07-22 03:27:52
I agree with his points, but if you fire someone it doesn't mean you have to delete every piece of work he's ever done.
@_date: 2016-07-12 23:41:14
It's called "looking ahead".
@_date: 2017-07-12 23:15:13
I got into bitcoin years ago by downloading a Blockchain wallet and handing physical cash to a guy at my local bitcoin meetup. Didn't get into exchanges till much later.
@_date: 2017-07-21 02:08:34
BitMEX is one.
@_date: 2017-07-28 00:11:06
I hope you're right, but banks operate in an alternate, protected legal universe -- whereas the govt feels it can kick crypto businesses any way it likes.
@_date: 2016-07-31 10:51:57
That's right, it's to avoid people [spamming the city]( with no-value tokens.
@_date: 2017-06-05 02:19:32
Sounds a bit paranoid, but in the times we live that's probably a prudent stance to take -- especially with governments.
@_date: 2017-06-05 03:21:32
Because they pay sweet government salaries that you can use to buy Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-12 22:04:52
To be honest, not  many people are. I was talking to a Bic Camera PR guy last week &amp; he said they'd only done a handful of bitcoin txs.
@_date: 2017-07-13 01:10:22
Was it not worth it?
@_date: 2017-06-12 22:02:44
I did a Woz -- bought in but then spent it all just playing with it &amp; finding out how it worked. I have a nice $300 bitcoin keyring though.
@_date: 2017-06-07 22:05:16
Would like to hear more about what he actually did, what sort of volumes he was moving etc. Still, WTF.
@_date: 2017-06-27 07:18:58
What does it even matter, if Segwit2x is on 86%+? And EC has never been a popular option anyway.
@_date: 2017-06-28 10:52:27
Ah haven't tried that yet, thanks. Will do.
@_date: 2017-06-28 08:13:30
I've never had any problem with Kraken either, just wish their charts &amp; overall interface didn't look so... 2013.
@_date: 2017-06-23 09:59:53
Interesting points, I wondered myself why he didn't change the logins first.
