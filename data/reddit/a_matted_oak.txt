Morality is meaningless. evil and good don't exist. the universe isn't worried about your consent. if allowing others to die because your worried about your property rights is good to you, your morality is flawed. if saving your own life at the cost of inconveniencing other's is good to you, your morality is flawed. taxation is thievery is as war is murder essentially correct but far over simplified to the point of loosing meaning, like an image that's been compressed far too many times. I don't care about having a moral government, all I want is a functional society. If you want to see pure anarchy move to Somalia.

Yes they are meaningless your death and ownership of property are meaningless, morality is just an evolutionary mechanism to stop us from killing each other.
Morality is based on emotions, and has very little place within a government which should be objective your entire argument is based on what you feel is right, and thus is a argument based on emotions.
Please provide me with a few sources for these functional stateless societies. Because from what I've been able to see, they've all been weak fragile groups of people prone to collapse, and prone to being conquered by the warlords that will always eventually form from anarchy.

nope, by their nature moral principles can never be objective, as morality in of itself is purely opinion.
