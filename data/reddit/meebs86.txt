What needs to happen is for Coinbase to move the fee to the vendor, like current credit card systems use. Because unless big vendors start and continue to offer sizable discounts for the bitcoin payment method, (most) people won't want to give up the security of a credit card AND pay more, just to buy online.

its introducing an option. Pay a fee for protection or take a chance for 'free'.

its a risk transfer from a lower risk tolerant person to a higher risk tolerant person.

I believe this is it...

I used mtgox &gt; dwolla a couple months ago (sold at 10.80 :(  )
money was in dwolla within a couple of hours and in my bank account within 2-3 business days.

Mining on each computer will earn a surprisingly small amount of money each. we're talking a penny a day if they aren't like modern core i7's
That said.. joining a pool is a good option. btcguild or 50btc are good user friendly pools that pay for every single share you submit.

That depends on if the company owners are willing to sell out. A company cant really just show up and force you to take their money and give them the company (referring to privately held companies).

They might also make a cut from the bitinstant "finders fees" they likely get

It wouldn't take much more than a few positive mainstream media coverage, and BEING RELEVANT to the mass publics interest. 
most people today are like "meh, i like my credit card, it works great for me already"

Buy btc and get it the heck out of gox. 
@_date: 2013-03-03 00:19:53
thats a very vague question. Its like asking "i'm getting 30 fps in crysis 3, is that good?" without knowing the GPU and the settings we can't really say for sure.. but 405 is pretty decent for a mid-range card (a radeon 7870 mildly overclocked for example gets about that)
@_date: 2013-03-07 02:59:39
the price dropping some just means you can buy more for even cheaper!
@_date: 2013-03-03 00:17:35
OP: Here are some tips for you:
1. Speed - This is how fast your card is working, the faster the better
2. "Accepted" - this is how many units of work you received credit for
3. "stale" - this is work for a "block" that has been found and is not valid, some pools pay for these and some don't.
I VERY much recommend you mine for a pool. Mining for a pool is kind of like being paid a wage, you get paid for what you do, regardless. IF you don't mine with a pool you are playing the lottery essentially.. it will take a VERY long time on average for you to get ANYTHING doing it by yourself, but when you do it'll be worth $875 at current btc/usd rates.
Personally, I would suggest you to use a PPS pool (a pool that pays the exact same for every share no matter what). Slushs' pool will pay more some days then other, as you get paid a portion of the work you do whenever the pool finds a block. This is tougher for newer miners as sometimes it sucks to go hours and your balance to not increase at all.
btcguild, 50btc and ozcoin are great, well respected pools to mine with that offer PPS payment.  
edit: at 270 mhash/s you can expect to earn 0.03 BTC/day, or about a dollar a day at current exchange rates.

Glad to see the vendor personally respond on here. +1 for that

slow wire transfers... wire transfers are just about as fast as bitcoin verifications, wires just cost a little more.
dont forget about how it takes DAYS to get cash out of the BTC system...

we need both sides of the equation ;-)

greed is a dangerous thing, espescially in the hands of one with the means to get loans to buy.. or one buying what they can't afford to lose. 
however.. i'd honestly say its WAY better to get screwed senseless in a BTC crash than it is to buy a car/house over your means and ruin your credit score. 
@_date: 2013-03-14 00:07:25
people sure don't like to be left out of the loop. that sounds like a great strategy. No need to explain it to him (or at least not nearlya s much) if there are real life examples of it working in everyday life around them.
@_date: 2013-10-13 04:45:59
"if you expect ROI"... that all depends on the future exchange rate of bitcoins.. 
if it goes up to $1000 (i'm not stating if/when it will happen).. then i'm sure buying equipment and mining with it now is a very profitable thing..
people have been saying for YEARS that mining is no longer profitable.. but last year when coins were 5-6 dollars... few would have dreamed it'd hit $200 within a few months time.
@_date: 2013-05-02 02:36:21
bad wiring, overloaded power supplies.. fires CAN happen.. there are several pictures of mining rigs catching fire on the forums
@_date: 2013-05-03 01:15:20
ya, at the end of the day if more and more businesses can show they are growing their business because of selling for BTC.. other businesses WILL eventually notice and greed will get them on the bandwagon in a hurry.

the smart thing would have bene to put thepaper wallet in a bank safety deposit box at a bank 10 hour drive away.. that way if you want to sell.. you have to WANT to sell, to make a 20 hour multi-day road trip to get them.

I REALLY wish BTCGUILD would man up and start limiting how much can be mined at his pool... but honestly... i think he is REALLY enjoying having 2% of all BTC mining income coming to him in pool fees on average (.4 *.05 = .02)
Edit: I didn't see his thread in time. sorry about that.
@_date: 2013-02-28 01:04:16
that depends really. With big news coming out every month it very well could be a VERY legit price. REmember there aren't THAT many coins out there, if many people want to start owning 100+ (which frankly is only a $3200 investment at this point), coins will "run out" and the price going up VERY fast. 
@_date: 2013-03-21 23:39:09
real life learning, but in its own little special club mostly ignored by the "professionals" currently. 
Funny thing is, a lot of things I kind of learned about in my internatinoal bussiness class are being applied (arbitrage is one of these concepts). 
@_date: 2013-04-07 15:07:38
or if they were wise and had failover pools setup, it would just move to the other pool automatically
@_date: 2013-04-06 03:12:38
if a double spend happens the value of the coins will plummet in a hurry and stay down for quite awhile.. until the trust is built up again. 
@_date: 2013-02-22 01:12:31
if you feel that is the case you should be putting as much money as you can into bitcoin.. working 60 hr weeks etc just to buy as much as possible

Using credit for anything bit coin is a bad idea.

how is it unfeasible? over weeks/months i'm sure there will be plenty of sell orders of people wanting to sell their coins to you.

You also forgot to mention that a non-insignificant portion of blocks mined now are done by ASICS which use an incredibly small amount of power compared to gpus....

There is a reason why "wall street" and the big banks pay BIG money to make sure their code is EXTREMELY perfet.

espescially since the guy was arrested for drug related stuff.. it would be silly to let him out on bond using drug money to do so.. hence having to prove the source of the funds.

considering if you go in really early.. $5-10 can easily become $50-500 if it takes off even slightly (like if a coin goes from being worth $0.0005 to $0.50)

If the government legally goes after anyone that will do business with an online poker company, the company will quickly go out of business if it can no longer get paid by its customers, and if the customers can no longer cash out from the poker company.
