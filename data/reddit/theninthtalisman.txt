What do you want to do when you get out?
Will you still do something related to bitcoin/crypto?
@_date: 2019-11-19 15:53:25
Neat!! Sounds like you'll involve bitcoin again! If you don't mind, could you elaborate a bit on what kind of businesses you're thinking of doing?
I've been in this space for a while, and after doing some homework I've come to think that bitcoin is our best shot at sound money. As a 20 some year old, I'm keen on working in/with the bitcoin space or peripheral industries to restore sound money.

if you have a wallet that adheres to the bitcoin network, then that wallet will recognize bitcoin only.
and that wallet cannot recognize tokens other than bitcoin because it's operating according to the bitcoin protocol.
this is why the risk/cost of verification is less compared to bullion, for which you would have to check the sample's mass, volume, and resonant frequency to verify that it is gold/silver/platinum
"Imagine buying 3 BTC, holding it. And finding out it's been hacked/stolen."
This has to do with how you manage your assets, and is not a topic unique to bitcoin.

Nope. mining isnt a taxable event thankfully

Yah heres a list that some crypto guys maintain. 
There are some travel agencies and airlines that arent listed here that accept btc.
From what I understand, most use mediaries, and the retailers just get the fiat equivalent of the transaction. Very few hold btc as assets.

Thanks. So I see that its similar to Japan’s policies in that both taxes are graduated, and it’s the difference between purchase and sale fiat price that is subject to tax. 
That sucks about the mining.
Curious about how you disclose/declare your mining with tax authorities. Do you have to disclose personal details when you join a mining pool that makes you traceable to the tax authorities?

i live here in japan. We're exposed to bitcoin a lot in the form of crypto exchange ads on building billboards, ads on trains, and a bunch of retailers put it out there that they accept bitcoin.
While all of that exposure is good, the tax policies here really bog down adoption.
spending and selling bitcoin or crypto here is a taxable event and a  "capital gains" tax is added to whatever gains from crypto that exceed 200k yen in a fiscal year. 
the tax rate brackets are determined by adding up other sources of income for individual, not just gains from cypto. so most people will have to cough up tax equal to about 20\~33% of "gains" made on crypto.
that on top of a 10% consumption tax... 
so yah. i'm hodling.
curious to know what the capital gains tax on crypto in other countries are and how that affects spending.

Oh wow... Just checked and youre right.
Tax bureau decided thats taxable too. It wasnt last time I filed btc related taxes.
Blows. So yah these policies are real road blocks to sound money in Japan. This has to change..
On a positive note, we had a few politicians running for the diet last term proposing a smaller tax rate to facillitate btc adoption and use. Didnt gain much traction though

Wow bitcoin natives!
Props to the parents who helped set them up. 
Btw are they using lightning?

The one with Tone right. 
It was exhausting listening to Schiff and his antics, but is he really trolling us?
Thought he was just kinda slow because he’s got a vested interest in pms, but if he’s trolling thats really low. Will lose respect.
@_date: 2019-05-27 14:52:17
do these exchanges always have the reserves to back themselves with?
or is it kinda like fractional reserve bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-05-14 13:36:27
take from them everything!

When usd and fiat turn to shit, it’ll be more relevant to compare btc to hard commodities like gold and energy.
We price btc in usd right now because the usd is the current world reserve currency. But world reserve currencies change quite frequently:
