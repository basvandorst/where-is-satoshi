What does it matter if you think the police has trouble with a case, you report a crime when there was a crime committed. This is why so many scams pop up, it's too easy to take money from greedy fools. Shout out to Danny Brewster.

Right now it's euros that they want (to buy stuff and pay bills), but have trouble withdrawing. No reason to spend the few cash they have on some geeky technological currency. Especially one that seems 100% digital - when that's exactly what enables their government to put in capital controls.
If and when Greece leaves the euro this effect becomes even stronger. Everything still in their accounts would convert and quickly lose value. Shops will want euros instead of the newly crashing Greek currency. They would stockpile the euros in cash - this is not the time to experiment or speculate!

Using the term 'hodling' is a nice contrarian indicator of bitcoin being a mainstream technology. Downvoting does not change that.

Its impossible to use more than 100% of all electricity. Also: no. It will probably use a shit ton, but it could also run on hardly anything. It can also displace electricity elsewhere. There are too many factors to say anything definite about it other than that it will probably be a lot.
Is that a problem? I dont think so. Supoly and demand.

High fees? I see those questions get answered constantly. Also, It's not about mining. Is using or having dollars about minting dollars?
Tipping? I don't see a point to tipping, and especially how dogecoin is a supposedly good example of it working. Doge is a joke.
Getting used to using it? Fair enough, but crypto IS still not fit for the average person. I think it may actually do more harm than good. This because of the spam effect and confronting people with complexity.
Also: BTC is not losing out on anything. It's moving forward as we speak, it just has less of a drooling following now because those people are hanging out in /dogecoin. That's good. I don't see why you would want /bitcoin to be about that. It's not a joke, it's about money, currencies, regulations, etc. There's nothing wrong with that!
So, again: you come off like just another whiner from making one of the dozen of threads a day telling people of to be more like @_date: 2014-08-09 11:26:00

Most bitcoin were owned by people who paid less than $100 for it. So the entire ride down from $1000 to today there were still people that could cash in on the new money getting it up to $1000 in the first place. This, coupled with the passing of the hype made it possible. You yourself said you have not checked up in a while. This phenomenon will exist for quite a while before Bitcoin sees any kind of stability.

Its a potientially vastly more effecient payment network (among other things). It might replace all that exist now. Even if for you personally there is no visible improvement, the system cuts costs, time, etc.

If you think us not currently being in the state 1930s Germany was in is comforting you missed my point. Society is not on its way towards utopia. There will be struggles and war in the future. Only this time, the next aggressor will have much more control over the people. We are all (!) creating this world. Maybe it feels different for you as a german, I am aware of the sensitivities in Germany. But, things have changed in the 2000s, in politicians words and actions. It reminds me of what we've been taught about the start of the first world war. They thought it would be over by Christmas. War is no joke, every society can collapse.

I suspect this will lower fees, but in time. Merchants will want to decouple from credit cards. Much like hardly any dutch merchants accepts them now. Transacting in bitcoin also removes the security issues that his the news almost daily. There is no sensitive customer payment data to steal. As Ive said before on this subreddit I dont think the change will come at the Point of Sale. The greater benefits are much more fundamental and structurally.

I'm not though. I'm comparing any pre-existing asset, be it commodity or money to something you personally don't yet have. It's iirrelevant if you have it or not. That is not the point. It *might* be a consideration if it's purely speculation, but even then it does not differ from real money (see my example) or stocks. The people getting in first always have an edge. It's simply irrelevant and these arguments are a waste of time.

ChangeTip could build their backend on just about anything. It's a centralized tipping system. It doesn't even run on Bitcoin. You can fill your wallet using Bitcoin, but they can snap their fingers and accept other kinds of payment. ChangeTip adoption is something entirely different than bitcoin adoption. I think it's dangerous to see half the people here don't even understand that.

That's unfortunate, because your explanation doesn't make me understand anything new or different.

Just makes you look bad if people point out your error, and you snap at them without trying to see if they are on to something. Gates quite clearly suggests an alternative that, unlike Bitcoin, is not tied to terrorism. Gates has been very clear about this in the past as well.

I don't know anything, for *consumers*. I already make small payments in shops without needing to get cash from an ATM. This is not a problem that you need Bitcoin for to solve. I would write your paper about another topic I think, because currently the case for the average consumer is very weak.
Why not just make it about merchants? I had my tires changed by an entrepreneur who operates out of a van. He accepted bitcoin. Bam, I can safely pay him anywhere I need a flat tire changed. No banks, no cash, no problem. Heck he could hook up his financial administration depending on the setup.

Hooray for me ;) Well then I, a layman, disagree that liquidity is best protected by printing more money. It's open to abuse. Do i trust governments to manipulate the worth of a currency with -my- interests in mind?
There is no bitcoin liquidity shock. There is supply and demand, and maybe some theft. Loss of liquidity leads to rising value. Combined with a infinitely divisible cryptocurrency it seems to me stable liquidity is built in.

I have to say, I conflicted with the idea of promoting Bitcoin to the masses. It's not very convenient, at least not the current implementation and its applications. It doesn't solve many, if any, problems for the majority of the public. A lot of usability issues in the current financial system can also be solved by traditional banks if they step up their game. A lot of people have posted before in \r\bitcoin that in many countries banking is in a better place than in the US. All of which are improvements that did not need bitcoin.
   
Bitcoin can provide both banks and merchants with better technology to move forward, of course, but those are not areas in which it matters if consumers came on board now.
  
   
As for the 'freedom' idea of empowering consumers by moving to Bitcoin. I suppose it's exciting, but I just don't see a compelling reason for people to revolt. Can I, as an individual, implode the system? My heating works, I got a roof over my head. The 1% screwing me over is too abstract for most of us to really do anything.
@_date: 2014-11-11 09:43:49

Why? And why cant you get rid of credit cards? Dutch merchants have never liked credit cards. They've always been the most expensive option here. Im not saying the world should adopt dutch pos-systems. It's merely to illustrate that credit cards are not almighty.

@_date: 2014-10-18 19:32:43
You are jumping to conclusions. Im not putting bitcoin opposite to credit. Im trying to stop the insistence of people to argue bitcoin NEEDS credit to compete with credit cards.
You dont NEED credit. The unending cycle of debt running the economy does, yes. But not you, as a consumer.  Not bitcoin, in its role as a payment network. The dominant method for payment in the Netherlands has been debit for years. (hint: visa priced itself out of the majority market a very expensive).
So no. I dont think credit is vital, because it not right now, not here. There are dozens of variables at play. Its silly to keep wanting bitcoin solutions to mirror credit cards. Thats not very out of the box.
I didnt realize having an opinion makes me ignorant. Had I known that I wouldn't have started thinking for myself.

@_date: 2014-10-15 20:39:10
Yes, as I understand it it's mostly in the sense that every satoshi can be uniquely identified. As such you can applications build on top of it. Just like with tcp/ip it's just a network, but you can run Facebook on it. You wouldnt need bitcoin or the blockchain itself to be a programming environment. 
@_date: 2014-10-27 20:58:03
Currency is whatever you and I decide to be a valid exchange for a good or service. So as long as you find people to agree on it holding value, then yes you can create money out of thin air. I think you do understand, but like most people never really thought about how our current money functions.

Guten Abend ;)
Based on what you've written I think we pretty much agree and I've just worded it differently. I did not mean to imply it merely takes one evil person. Quite the contrary, I think 'evil' is much closer, and therefore much more threatening than we think. In your encryption example it does not even need bad intent to end up with bad consequences. People often pass and support these laws for entirely different reasons. This is the dangerous path we've taken. It's just that 'hitler' is an easy concept to use when trying to explain the dangers of power.
I think there are quite some Europeans around but you can't hear the accents when someone is typing ;)

FDIC is not theft protection. You trust your bank. They make more money by not running away and stealing your dollars. Bitcoin is young. It's easier to enter the market as a thief then, but it's still the same thing. You and many people's faith in how 'regulation' keeps you safe (it doesnt) is only a result of how big the system is. That doesn't change the fact that it's 100% trust based. See also: credit crisis.

The idea Xapo has is the other way around from the real revolution. They try to attach Bitcoin to existing networks.

That is where the potential profit lies, even for banks.

Wouldn't you do some research if you wanted to stash $50,000 away? That is a *definite* case of read the manual if you ask me. I think this sub is very welcoming to newbies. I see people trying to answer security question quite often and quite extensively. I don't think taking every single bitcoin loss as shocking disaster will do anyone any good either. Especially when people often seem to put thousands of dollars in, frankly quite glaring, unsecure places. It makes it bitcoin look a lot more dodgy than it actually is.
So I hope the vibe is "Welcome newbie", and "You should know better though, Bitcoin veteran with thousands of dollars".

As someone already mentioned salt is a virtually limitless supply and even worse as a tool for actual transaction. The same goes for denying the possible use as a currency while it is happening right before our very eyes.

So if you're telling me this is happening because some lucky people are actually off-loading realised profits from 2009, then I don't see how this is a good thing. That is bound to stop - but they have very deep pockets on the way down.

Credit cards suck. Im sure they solved some sort of problem back in the 70s, but there are a vast amount of better solutions these days. Not to mention credit card fees are insane. It's time to let go. We don't even need Bitcoin to make credit cards obsolete, it's just that everything in finance moves slow.
In other words, any Bitcoin initiative that tries to imitate/integrate credit card systems is, in my opinion, either not thought out very well or simply trying to scam you.

I don't think it matters. It's like if we had flying cars now. You'd start by integrating them on our existing roads. You wouldn't start by breaking down the old roads and thinking of how to best put use the new potential of flying cars.
Maybe my example is all that wonderful, but I'm pretty sure that bitcoin hitching a ride on the existing infrastructure is THE best way to move forward.

A little bird told me that's a coordinated effort to stick close to a fixed price. It's no true one price. Either way, it needs a large market and a lot of trading and arbitrage to come to such a stable price. Bitcoin is nowhere near that.

Look. Creditcards already are not the dominant payment in say The Netherlands. Our system is massively cheaper. So your (the blogs) entire premiss is wrong. Credit cards ARE ripe for disruption. Bitcoin is just a more extreme disruption. Time and time again I am surprised at how supposed forward thinking bitcoin supporters seem unable to see that creditcards are an ancient and broken payment network.

Great video, great speaker! I love his explanation of the current financial system being high risk and our only solution to the financial crisis, hiding the fact the risk is there, only made it bigger. He outlines how even gold is trapped in this (derivative) system and we should get out of the current financial system to spread risk.

Where does he say no products were listed? He doesn't. The full quote means exactly the same. He made no sales. Black Friday was a fail for him! You reading this all wrong (I'm sure you want to really bad) is why that subreddit even exists :P
*edit: Seriously, read it again.. He says the site is new and not much is up yet. He doesn't say bitcoin orders are not up. It's just a new shitty webshop (like most of the shitty deals). So Im not surprised he didnt get any orders, I'm wondering if he get any orders **at all**. Wouldn't you find that more interesting?

Your explanation is perfectly clear. I am shocked at how many people fail to understand this - in a tech subreddit no less. Is a more newbie-friendly approach needed to how you handle new accounts? I am glad to hear you disabled email backups by default. Perhaps a security tutorial page for new accounts would be an idea? Something where very graphically and point by point the process of logging on and having a backup is explained. I think an analogy might help people a bit. Like logging onto Picasa with a google authenticator is high security, but downloading the photo in question makes the weak spot your desktop.

I think the main advantage is for merchants, not consumers. If I buy online at a dutch web vendor for $1000 I would pay $1000 via an instant electronic transfer, and not a penny more.
It's up to the vendor to translate his cost savings to the customers - which should be rather simple to do versus credit card costs. We just have to wait for it.
@_date: 2014-06-01 20:00:58
You are right about almost everything. Just that the value of 1 btc will rise when more are lost. Since Bitcoin is theoretically divisible without limit, it will never lead to a transaction shortage.

Well in that case. Bit is a part, bit is part of the word bitcoin. Bit is simple and international.

That's my argument :)

 I think the best solution would be to get Reddit itself to integrate tipping, just like you can give gold directly to comments. This would save a lot of spam. Everything can be handled behind the screens and a posts could have a tip-jar style meter displayed. I'm not sure how to make this happen, but it would be cool ;)
Most the tips I see are drive-by tips, even if they are accompanied by a half-hearted contribution. All they do is clutter up threads. It's like ramming the like button except you see "MARIE LIKED THIS" added every time.
I must say though, my wife (a lurker) hasn't noticed any tipping on reddit, so we have a long way to go to go viral.

*Are* they looking for a way? The solution is easy. Yet my feedback in that thread was downvoted. The old bitcointip didn't spam as much.

Is a milli in use? A million is derived from it, as are 'cents', but the meaning of the prefix is of no help. What hundred (cent) does it denote? A hundredth or a hundred? The same confusion applies.  
What remains - is simply an agreed upon term that over time becomes synonymous with a certain value. Such as 'dollar' and 'euro' themselves. Such as the precise definition of how many dollars one cent make up. So yes, that could very be 'lars', or 'eur' - but that's not how history decided. Bit seems like a decent word. What bit do we mean exactly? That doesn't matter, in time the exact amount will become a habit.  
  
What does *not* help, is using the actual prefixes in their full meaning. Your sub-penny stocks come to mind. You are right in that the prefixes are used there (and the best solution). It's technical, it needs to be precise, why not. I don't agree that it's a solution you can apply to every day use. A lot of prefixes across a wide range of value is simply confusing. Not to stupid people, no - to everyone. The name and value for bit is taking a speculative leap of faith to a world where one bit is worth much more. All that matters then is **an agreed upon name** for the common used amount. Just like dollar or euro, it's not a mathematical term that matters. It's just a word.  
  
Stop trying to force math into every use of terms. It's not about math - it never was. You overcomplicate things. Much like this post of mine.

Lol, well good for you. I don't. That would be a day job. Are you even honest, or simply oblivious to the amount of scams a person is daily exposed to? 
  
My invesment? Pfff. You purposly misread what I intend to say. I reject the notion that the bitcoin sphere is all scams. Just like I don't go around screaming and keeping people away from scams on the street or at traditional banks. Doing that focuses attention on the wrong thing. Go ahead and misunderstand me again.
Edit: it helps noone to rely on you (or any other third party) pointing out what a scam is and what is not It makes you the next authority, trust, point of scamming. Thats not fucked up, thats a different perspective.

We don't have to worry about consumer adoption once banks, financial institutions and merchants realise Bitcoin is the superior money network.

You used to be able to do this at bitonic.nl, some people even sold items at marktplaats (dutch ebay) that you could instantly-pay by going to bitonic and filling in the sellers bitcoin wallet. Alas, the government shut it down after scammers used it as a route to get people to part with their money. It was quite brilliant though, instant confirmation of sale.
I'd say don't bother your customer too much. Have you been clear about your payment wishes up front? Why can't you withdraw from paypal? I would be very weary if I were the customer and you'd make me jump through hoops.

@_date: 2014-04-19 09:36:20
Except that credit cards are an ancient and stupid form to pay for things (Every time I say this hordes of pretend-bitcoiners downvote me).
One of THE main features of bitcoin, if you ask me, is that it is push technology, not pull. -I- decide who to pay and how much. I don't give out my card and *trust*. As many people say, yet few seem to grasp, Bitcoin is digital cash. So while I agree that it needs a more user friendly layer - this should not and **need** not be in the form of a type of credit card.
This year dutch banks have begun rolling out early NFS and mobile payment solutions. None of these innovations, or any by the dutch banks for the past 15 years, are based on pull technology or trust based systems. It's instant, it's pushed, it's always on.
I'm well aware that most of the rest of world has been doing well with credit cards. In dutch we call that the Law of the handicap of a head start. Sticking to plastic for so long has been detrimental to development, to fraud prevention, to consumer interest as a whole. Better solutions **are** available and don't even need Bitcoin. This is why I don't think the future for bitcoin is adopting a credit card look.
@_date: 2014-06-18 18:22:56
No. Maybe a usability issue, at most? Technogically vastly superior to regular banking technology. The problem is not at the core. Its simply the top layer.

First off: "Discuss!?" is very annoying. Its a cop out to cover up you not actually starting a discussion but merely blurting out thoughts. Second: bitcoins' volatility is due to lack of scale. This will be so for quite some time. You wanted to get rich within a year. Third:  attracts more idiots (and young well meaning geekie kids without a clue).
@_date: 2014-08-10 22:40:51
Probably because coinbase works off-blockchain. You have an account with them. Thats not a real wallet with bitcoin in it.

'If you believed' - vs 'cannot lose'. That is false causality. A believer merely 'believes' he will not lose. It does not make this absolute in the slightest.

I have to admit it has been a while since I gave myself a headache over actual statistics, so it's hard for me to respond with as much analysis as you can. I see posted a wired article that describes what I meant. It's entirely possible to roll only 1s for 2000 throws and fit randomness of distribution. It would raise my eyebrows, but it would not conclusively prove that the dice are unfair. Your next 2000 dice rolls could be the inverted version of your table and combined make for a normal distribution. I realize that a test makes it seem far away from a normal distribution, but randomness can take a while. 
  
Perhaps you could run a test on different subsets of your rolls (1st 500, 2nd 500, 3rd 500, 4th 500) to see if those datasets fit eachothers distribution. Do they show the same distribution (something you would expect if N=40 would be enough), or is there a large deviation? I'm curious what that shows. I'm sorry that I am unable give you a better response.

I think it's most likely changetip will die out. It's just a PayPal-like central system with a not-so-awesome implementation.

Only 100 upvotes for the only proper (and big) positive news in heh.
I think they are  investigating sn open system (so why not the existing bitcoin network),  because a proprietary trust based network would already be 'easy'. Dutch banks have a history of cooperation on payment networks; the reason why visa and mastercard are relatively small players here.
An open network can improve efficiency worldwide. So would a closed one but do you really see cooperation on that scale happening? I think the dutch banks realize blockchain is the way forward.

You are used to this because there is zero safety in the current money transfer system. If a bank or a company wants to screw with you they can, and this happens (!)

I don't know if this assumption is true. I use google to find out something. I never type mortages.com, tcpip.com, or internet.com, just to name a few random examples. I look it up with a search engine and try to find reputable or known websites explaining what I want to know. A site like mortage.com is probably expensive spam or clickbait and I would expect the same from bitcoin.com/.org/.net/.takingcandyfromababy.

You confirm what I said. 
@_date: 2014-12-10 11:59:07
Id say in countries with such volatility you could see saving money as opposed to spending as speculating yes. But neither answer to that question determines if accumulating bitcoin is a speculative decision. Even in the countries you mentioned it would still be a gamble to put your money on bitcoin instead, regardless of how probable a price rise may or may not be. I wouldnt dare suggesting the man on the street there should turn to bitcoin for savings.
 
Incidentally, my mom bought a bitcoin. She thought I was passionate and convincing, but her savings are firmly in euros. I think its safe to say that for regular people (the ones you want us to convert) using euros still beats the practicalities of bitcoin in every way. Except: speculating.

Oh yes. I have one. Why not, it doesn't cost me anything. I barely use it though. I have it connected to my google account for the play store - and it's vaguely interesting to use when I travel outside the EU. Basically international online sales are where they work - because (as Ive mentioned in another post) the inability of banks and governments to decide on a new standard keeps creditcards in use. Not the lack of alternatives.
This is Bitcoin's strength. It's not "a country's invention". It's global. It just might take over. No ego's will be hurt.

You are talking about the front end user experience. You are, unfortunately, right in that a lot of people here are trying to argue the wrong thing. It's the backbone that matters.

This is so wrong I am completely baffled. This teaches all users all the wrong things about security.

I think it's more if they *wanted* to, they would have done so. It's also entirely possible that they want to shut it down later. They *can* though. Maybe not on the black market, but for mainstream use it's clear that Bitcoin can be stopped.

Bitcoin won't find stability at these low levels. It needs to be much higher to support real economic use or go bust. The third option, stability at a low price point, would only be an option if Bitcoin somehow found a small niche without actually dying out.

Excellent infrastructure and 35 minimum donation? That combination makes no sense. There is room for improvement if accepting $5 is too much trouble.

Yea, pretty much. Do you go out of your way to warn people of scams everywhere? I don't. Take the 'traditional' financial services sector for example. Id argue those are littered with both legal and illegal scams, yet we all 'trust' business and middlemen with our money. All this pointing at, in my opinion obvious, bad ideas and scams is like a big billboard saying: "Shady stuff here!". It doesnt teach anyone to be mindful. It keeps it all about blind trust.

At point of sale you can accept payment after seeing the transaction in the blockchain, this takes mere seconds. The under the hood confirmation is faster than credit cards under the hood. The only issue is merchants' view of what sort of confirmation they want to wait for before pouring you a cup of coffee.

It was far from "THE" superior product. That you now state this as fact is a testament to the brand appeal Apple enjoys. Many players were easy to use!

Err. If you insist on calling me a "statist". I don't support the deficit spending that unfortunately many western governments love. So that's how I can support it, I suppose. Norway has no deficit.

The current financial system and governance are not connected at the hip.
@_date: 2014-12-06 17:54:18
This is complete bullshit. I dont use nor endorse blockchain.info, but the security concerns have nothing to do with blockchain.info itself. Too many people here are simply ignorant and rely on trusting someone or something that they don't understand. 
A witch hunt on blockchain.info does nothing to remove the reason people get their wallets emptied in the first place: user error. We should not make this about picking the right party to trust. Thats inherently anti-bitcoin if you ask me.

Dont see what this has to do with Bitcoin. I also find it hard to believe that American banks are using THAT ridiculous login security to make this plausible. (The now) ING has offered remote banking using 2FA in the Netherlands from 1986 and over the internet from 1998. They've had their share of issues, but nothing like user access based on what sounds like account names matching account balances in an MS Acces table.

As ive posted in their thread: They only move bitcoin (and even that only virtually). Changetip does not deal with dollars. This means they are not classified as money transmitters according to the Fincen ruling nor NY proposals. 
That said. Theres no need to play along with their game and make a thread here every time 'they' do something. We can go back to not being high school again.
Edit: I was wrong. See below. The new release specifically mentions that facilitating transfer of value alone constitutes a money transmitter.

Site looks nice enough. I must ask though: apart from bitcoin fans, why would you pay your bills with bitcoins - through your service? You charge a fee to do it. Maybe all banks in Canada do that? I would consider switching to support Bitcoin, but your fees would not win me over. (I'm dutch though, so my situation might be different.)

There are a lot of people involved in Bitcoin who would give an arm to be a real world banker. A lot of people simply want a redistribution of wealth in their direction.
Many bitcoin initiatives lack transparency, accountability and are centralized. Some is naivety, simply copying the old ways. Some is stupidity "trust us". Some is because its just so damn easy to scam greedy people out of their money.
Your post, as far as Im concerned, should be one of many that challenge and change the landscape of Bitcoin. No more 'trust us', no more bullshit. We're dealing with real, actual value.

'Blablabla yawn yadayada I have no clue what I am talking about dollars are evil blablabla'. Stop it. You are making a fool out of yourself by making a personal attack backed up by having the facts wrong. Bitcoin is a speculative asset. Putting your savings into it does not equal saving, it is speculating that its value will rise. Not only are you wrong, but promoting bitcoin like that is irresponsible.
 
I don't see how asking me if I thought of it myself makes for a good argument. I merely stated a fact. Although technically by stating facts I *do* parrot something.

I dont think the imac did what you think it did. I also think it will be a long time until bitcoin will actually come down to regular people. I think banks incorporating bitcoin as the financial backbone is what will happen. 
@_date: 2014-08-27 18:13:58
You can export the private key of the wallet you send it to and import it in another wallet (like electrum for example). I'm not sure how to go about it as I don't have it installed myself anymore either.
As others have said, your coins are registered 'in the blockchain' - so even if the client screws up or you are offline - they are safe. AS LONG AS you (use a wallet where you yourself) actually own the private key (so no online wallet)

I think most coins from will be lost forever, judging by the amount of people promoting encrypted wallets only or simply memorizing electrum seeds. Hell those in the last category will even lose their money during their lives after a car accident or simply old age.

It's coinbase that's slow. Imagine going to a tourist exchange kiosk in another city and the teller saying "thanks for the cash, now I'll give you pesos next week". That is what coinbase does. If it's because of laws, slow banking or something else does not really matter. Just remember it's not the Bitcoin (technical) side of it that causes your delay.
I can buy bitcoins instantly in The Netherlands for example. Once I confirm my debit payment it's usually in my wallet within 30 seconds.
As other have mentioned US laws make it harder at the moment for such a smooth experience.
These summer holidays actually I wanted more BTC in my bitcoin wallet to make a purchase at a camping place (seriously!). I punched in the order on my smartphone, got new BTC and made the purchase.

Yes. I also find it fascinating that we have more balanced (and even positive) background news articles now, contrasting with the price mania in 2013. The other half is doom and gloom, based on price action alone. Its a nice reversed situation from the bubble. I consider that a powerful signal.

I know what a thousand is. I grew up with the metric system. Im dutch. Stop linking that as if it magically explains everything. The point is that even though you might technically be correct, that does not help usability and ignores the fact that all meaning is merely an agreed upon definition. A milli, like a cent, like a bit, can be anything depending on the context you apply it to.

My point would be (though I didnt talk about that in this comment) to be careful with your money. So yea, startups in particular are high risk.
 
As for NeoBee I would like to disagree. They really, really didnt have a plan. People asked questions before it collapsed. They/we (who raised questions)  were shunned.

You can sign a transaction for free, but a transaction is a transfer of bitcoin (= cost). Although, now that I 'm writing that again I suppose I can transfer to myself and not lose value yet still write to the ledger. I hope you at least understand what I was trying to say now - even if I ended up incorrect ;D

I also think it's because CEOs of dying industries have no incentive to 'save the future' of the company. The board of directors is never ready for the premature shift of business focus, so you fight an uphill battle costing millions of stockholder money. Easy route: fight to keep the current market. Keep easy job. Retire in 10 years when it becomes clear the market reality has in fact changed. Thats what -I- would do.
In a publically traded company really thinking ahead is suicide. Short term stock holder value dictates that the CEO only defend the status quo.
@_date: 2014-08-05 10:35:43
All currencies fluctuate. Bitcoin fluctuates a lot more because it is young and has little liquidity. Bitcoins' value needs to be much higher for it to become more stable.

You understand it right. If you look at your android wallet like a regular cash wallet you can have much better protection using a code, but you're still carrying a wallet on you. Don't keep all your funds in it.
This is why bitcoin can be scary, it puts us in charge of our own cash again - except digital.

No they cant, but I suppose they can practically never trace credit card thieves. Its too damn fraud sensitive. I presume your Cc company will covers the costs? I always hear how theft protection is excellent. Im not certain, ive always steered clear of using credit cards.

It could just be a satoshi. It doesn't directly raise the value of bitcoins as a currency. It is meant for a future where the blockchain powers notaries, insurances, property and many more things worldwide. It would not be feasible to use only 21 million coins for that.

365 days times $8 is $2920. So just for one year you want me to spend 3k to merely keep the price level(!). I don't have that kind of money that I can freely afford to lose. I wouldn't say you have to worry, but the fact remains that the dropping price this past year indicates there is still more supply than we can gobble up.

Why? That's much faster than debit credit and sepa transactions. Seems to me bitcoin is lightning fast compared to those. You are confused because a shop accepts your credit card payment before they actually receive the money. They can do this with Bitcoin as well, network propagation is very fast, it's just that some retailers don't and wait for the full transfer of money. I have personally never met any retailer or online store who did not instantly accept my bitcoin payment though.
@_date: 2014-12-12 14:44:06
Demand will have to outpace Bitcoin's inflation rate. It's likely that last year the demand was lower, but speculation mania drove it out so high. The market tries to find a point where supply and demand meet and sometimes the market over- or undervalues that. Everyone is still pretty meh about the price, apart from a pumping moon cultist here and there. I think most believers already bought the coins they could afford and we need new adopters. Merchant adoption and software development does not buy new coins.

Yes, but that's exactly what this advice was last December. That attitude is dangerous and really, really bad advice. As you must be aware, people who got in then lost a lot of money. What makes your advice different? Only hindsight, but you cannot predict what will happen next. It's the type of advice that is bad, not your timing.
If all you think Bitcoin is about is the speculative value, then by all means speculate on that, but don't mistake that for good advice to introduce strangers to Bitcoin.

I don't spend my money a lot. I don't buy stuff just because someone takes bitcoin. I pay my mortgage, buy gas, do groceries. None of these have merchants accepting bitcoin for me. Most sell niche products (liquorice) that I wouldn't buy (regularly) to begin with. I think the overlap between potential customers and those having bitcoin is just extremely small in most cases.
  
Another example: one prepaid phone provider here accepts bitcoin. But Im on a contract, and my contract is from a better provider. Im not holding on to my coins, I just hardly see a legitimate reason to spend any. Now if takeaway.coms' sales have also crashed - that would be different.

I dont see this happening for the same reason all these company points and gift cards even exist in the first place. People don't *care* that its a centralized token you only redeem at a particular company. All those points now have nothing to do with actual money either. But noone cares, because hey saving up for a free hamburger. 
I see how it might be interesting from a technical point of view, but these systems are simple and centralized *by design*. Bitcoin does not solve a problem here.
@_date: 2014-06-29 15:53:53
I dont think you are surprised, you seem to be very proud of being smarter than someone on the internet. However, you are wrong.  Chargebacks are also mainly a US mechanism, because they invented the fraud sensitive credit cards. Again: I dont need charge backs in my daily life. Shops are obligated to comply to consumer protection laws. This is another reason merchants will love charge backs and as the dutch system proves you will end up with a vastly superior way to pay. Relax, you will like it.

Yes, it is much easier. Cash is king for fraude. I think that's the opportunity the US authorities see. They are even open about that. Bitcoin becoming big will give much greater power to stop money laundering.
It's more of a 'wow we can be here at the start and do much more crime fighting ', than 'bitcoin is evil'. But not everyone recognises that. Theres also a (naive) group of bitcoiners who hope to be able to avoid taxes.

I thought it was excellent in that he didn't spend the obligatory "what is bitcoin" 5 minute rehash that most newspapers and tv channels still do when covering Bitcoin.

I agree with them though. I don't see why you discard their post as mumbling about decimal places. It was one of the few times there was sensible talk about the whole issue. The decimals need to go. Studies show that working with decimals is difficult (for example    
 &amp;nbsp;
Example: 11,1 is one unit of tens, one of ones and one unit of tenths (!). The units behind the comma don't follow the same rules. It's counter intuitive.  
 &amp;nbsp;
What follows is:  
* We need to get rid of the decimals
* We need a word to describe that spot we pick to do that
* Words describing a coin can be more or less randomly picked (see: origin of the dollar 
 &amp;nbsp;
And there you have it. Bit has my vote so far, but for me the most important thing is *avoiding* over complicating the issue with decimals or mathematical prefixes.

Well in Europe its very easy, so Im pretty sure only US banks are screwing their customers to the extent you describe. For bitcoin to beat European banks in usability it has a LOT of catching up to do. (None of which is relevant, because it's not about the front end that matters.)
@_date: 2014-06-04 14:20:40
Hell no. To elaborate: You want a merchant to *pull* money from your wallet. The ol' credit card mechanic. With bitcoin you *push*(give) money to the merchant. How it should be, and how debit cards have been working in Europe for a long time now.
I don't see how your idea even makes it any easier. It doesn't matter. The transaction can also be done with NFC or similar technology. Bump, done - but why the hell would you want it to be pulled. You would give up control for no reason?
@_date: 2014-11-11 09:25:47
What role is left for changetip in that scenario?
**Current situation**
Changetip now might as well trade pokemon points or actual USD. It has little to do with Bitcoin. We pay Changetip and it virtually distributes value among users. Why noone ever did this with USD? Well, maybe because it's unlikely we'd send actual money to a random intermediary. Maybe because so far it didn't seem that useful, and microtransactions have failed to take off. Another reason is that you'd need a license (see: FinCen guidelines) - which, how I understand it, Changetip will need to fullfil.
**Ideal situation**
Websites integrate microtransactions (tipping) in a way that hook into the bitcoin protocol. "Pay here" "Tip here" pops open your dekstop wallet and lets you send a few bits - real bits, not centralized representations of bits.
I believe the 2nd option makes Changetip obsolete, and that's ok. I believe that is also the answer to your reply. Why would you partner with them in this case? It's essentially a redundant step. Option 1 even needs more regulation. You add a money transmitter in the mix. In option 2 you just have websites and people accepting a certain form of payment.

Doesn't feel all that special to be honest. It's a small amount that slowly decreases (I see you made a typo) in value over time. Also, my bank account doesn't *really* feel in danger over the government seizing it, let's be honest.
 
Are you honestly saying the relative 'stability' (a pause in the downtrend) is one of the positives now? This is grasping at straws in between trending down. You do realize that this 'stability' means nothing. Bitcoin won't be 'stable' until much a higher evaluation.
  
The only positive side is what happened every time over the past 18 months of downtrend when it slowed down: a breather from losing more money.

I've said it here many times. Don't use Armory and ignore people promoting it. It's not for regular users.

Import the key to another wallet and delete Armory.

Does US-Canada not have sone cooperative infrastructure like in European countries? I sometimes send my brother in Norway money from The Netherlands (or vice versa) and it's quote easy just doing a bank transfer. Especially for such a large amount I wouldn't risk moving it across bitcoin if it wasn't necessary.

I don't think they do. Many posts get high upvotes. I think you want the mods to be less neutral than they are. For instance: not every downvote is in support of CCN or GAW. I don't think all of the posts add something to the subreddit, so then I hit the down arrow and move along.

I find ironic that in a subreddit that encourages "being your own bank" we spend so much time trying to get people to handle their money responsibly and not throw it out randomly (and in some cases advising to doing just that as well, looking at you americanpegasus).
  
If people are still dumb enough to be scammed when things are this obvious I'd say let them. These people obviously dont *want* to think about it, no amount of motherly education will teach the needed lesson.

I realize that, that's what's confusing. What happened is someone copied the code and that apparantly crushed SatoshiLabs' ideals. In what way, what ideals?

Im no financial genius by any means, but it seems to me being able to short something is not the problem. If the market sees value in something, shorting would hurt eventually. Would you short something right down to nothing when you -did- think it was worth more? No, you would buy at those prices. So the market decides what bitcoin is worth.

I'm downvoting as much as I can, but can the mods do something about the endless cycles of circlejerking that aren't even about Bitcoin? (last month WU, this month GAW, next month another altcoin?). The community rules give some guidance on this, so it would be possible to remove some of the threads wouldn't it?
* News articles that do not contain the word "Bitcoin" are usually off-topic
* Submissions that are mostly about some other cryptocurrency belong elsewhere
* Please avoid repetition
  
I suppose some people see a link to bitcoin, or have good intentions - but it degenerated all the way into "I was a GAW fan but now I also see the light give my posts some upvotes as well!! high five!!". I almost miss dogecoin posts.

Bullshit. It's fine if a business runs a profit. I questioned describing running a profit as  'crushed ideals'. People sucking up to the business (!) SatoshiLabs runs because they drum up a happy-go-open-source initiative, that is what I object to.

Bullshit. It's full on circle jerking every single witchhunt. All those redundant posts bring nothing new or even relevant. If people wanted to warn paycoon customers their forum, the paycoin or the general crypto subreddit would be more suited. There is no reason for to keep being flooded with shit as if it were a general crypto/fuck the government/financial advice/altcoin discussion forum.

Well, the fees are rapidly becoming so high that bitcoin as a payment channel becomes irrelevant. This might be not be a problem, if you accept that it won't be a currency then, but that is what is happening. But I still see people arguing that the fees aren't all that high and coming up with comparisons to dinosaur technology (visa). The banks have not been sitting in their asses, well outside of the US at least.

Agreed. Digital content, international sales. This is a no-brainer to set up Bitcoin for.
@_date: 2015-05-10 20:10:10
This is simply not true. No matter how hard people believe in the strength of their favorite currency. They can and do fluctuate quite a lot sometimes. For example, the euro lost 35% against the dollar in only a few months. Fuel prices here shot up in market of cheap oil.

It's too expensive. I used to order takeaway, but it's only been causing delays over the past year. Not to mention used to be the cheapest payment option and now it's the expensive one.

@_date: 2017-03-03 09:52:50
Yes they will, no they won't. Bitcoin is quite wasteful with transactions. It's not a bank account where you sometimes get money in or send some out. 
@_date: 2017-03-04 16:11:51
Nice write up, but that was definitely not the starting point. Gavin took to blogs because he felt he wasn't getting anywhere and an open blog would do the trick. Obviously other people involved objected to that style, but they objected to the solution before.

I completely agree. I'm not even a miner but those are what the protocol is based on, not a bunch of whiney developers and wallet users. If they want to be in charge, make a coin where the devs are centrally in control. 
@_date: 2017-03-05 09:36:44
In the meantime bitcoin is nothing like what people on were advertising and cheering about three years ago. When I mentioned before that bitcoin fees were not competitive people would yell and scream and say bitcoin blew credit cards out of the water. Now that bitcoin as a currency REALLY is not competitive anymore and people REALLY stopped using it for that suddenly it's "oh no biggie it works as intended". The change of sentiment here baffles me.

Reading through the comments here makes me sad. People don't wabt bitcoin ti be used anymore. Not for voting, not for buying coffee. Why some people even stick here with their view of what bitcoin is (and what they view as bad use) is beyond me. I'm really surprised at just how much has changed since Gavin left the community. This thread should be all cheers and high fives - but it seems petty infighting has hijacked the fee market and everyones vision for bitcoin.

The fact is everyone celebrated this mechanism until apparently someone managed to gain so much mining power and we disagree with their vision. I'm not sure of the alternative is better. As far as I can tell (I am but a nobody) we are either facing a fundamental crypto crisis or everything is working as intended.

Nah that's bullshit. Theymos has quite openly taken a position on how he thought the bitcoin code should move forward and squashed open discussions about it on this subreddit. It was cheap, it was needlessly divisive and above all it was not what I'd call moderation. It was an attempt to steer the discussion. I mean seriously? On an open discussion platform? Sure it is his prerogative, but it definitely set the mood.

Its just financials from now on.

Breadwallet follows bitcoin's design principles. It's a choice, it's not an attack.

I agree that it looks pretty shitty. Kudos for being open about it though.
   
I don't agree with their assessment of Europe benefitting from a single payment platform, it simply adds another. Accepting visa or mastercard is the only single option for the fragmented European market. I do agree that online merchants in Europe seem more used to experimenting, since it's fragmented as it is... But it's all peanuts so far.
  
Edit: as an anecdote, my wife was recently reviewing payment options for online courses at her job. You can easily turn things on or off via the processor's customer ui. The api provides access to many things, including bitcoin which she then simply added. So the potential for a very fast market takeover remains, but there is little incentive.  (it was the cheapest option to activate though).

You will always find repeating patterns in graphs. They go up or down. Especially if you allow yourself to liberally zoom in and out. I've seen this "pattern match" posted almost weekly all the way down from 1200 to today. One of you might seem right (if Bitcoin ever goes up again), but it won't be because of a matching pattern.

I never had trouble buying in the US from Europe either. I think the story is bullshit and everyone claiming problems try to use a debit card from a European bank instead of a credit card.

@_date: 2015-07-27 12:29:19
I agree that the reposts comparing it to the internet or email are getting tiring, but not for the reasons you state. Bitcoin does on the surface solve a problem most people don't have, but the same can be said for the internet. I just logged on to chat to people in Australia, I wasn't trying to solve any problem. The rest of my country didn't give a shit either. It changed the world in ways we did not expect, it gave us products we didn't know we wanted.
I do agree its incomparable as far as user friendliness or usability in every day situations is concerned. I really do not have a reason to use bitcoin apart from geeking out while doing so. There are only some niche applications that might interest the consumer right now (unless you live in a third world banking country like the US I suppose).
Comparitively speaking we're a long way from Newsweeks' 1995 - still waiting for useful applications to be build. The difference is that these days there is much greater and earlier exposure to innovation.

Im not comparing to credit cards, that's ultimately not the competition. But still, insane consumer fees at transaction level are not the future. 
@_date: 2015-07-20 12:35:39
I really do not understand why millions of people are so infatuated with credit cards. Banks in other countries have experimented for years with online payments. Dutch banks for example created the iDeal standard for instant online payments. It let's me pay online within a couple seconds via a secure banking API and using 2FA. No credit card data stored at any retailer is necessary. I don't think bitcoin is the answer to everything right now, but there are better answers than credit cards.
   
   
Not on-topic, but I was reading about hiking in Norway the other day. They have a lot of cabins in the mountains that hikers can use to stay overnight. It said you could leave your credit card details in a box as payment. Made me realize I would have to sleep there without paying, because that's a risk I'm not willing to take. Would be easy to have a QR code up in that mountain cabin to accept payments.

I don't know in what country you worked for an ISP, but I've had cable since '98 in the Netherlands and it has been the best, cheapest and fastest option for my town for 17 straight years now. Also, 20% of the population was using the Internet by 1998 already ( Are you counting backwater countries? Not that these numbers or your anecdotes matter. You are counting some arbitrary 'total adoption', where OP is pretty clear about what he means. Those 20% to 30% of households on dial-up in 1997, that is massive compared to the tiny amount of consumer adoption of bitcoin.

Why, why do you use the price rise as your main argument for wanting to be taken seriously? A lot of shitty things and ridiculous ideas go up in value. This is not helping, especially considering the enormous amount of moon kiddos who would encourage pensioners to buy bitcoin at 1100, 1000, 900 and all the way to where we are now.

But the pain SHOULD have shifted to the investors - a long time ago. The debt only got larger this way and it told investors that high risk is only a label, not a truth. The blame DID shift already, but 0 of it to the actual investors or people handing out loans. I can play bank like that too, lol.

Cash (including ATM) has zero fees for me.
I still like my zero fee debit card better for ease of use, but you don't even have that option.
How is bitcoin a better store of value than cash? What are you even comparing?
Unregulated is a plus, a minus, how do I even care about it?
Bitcoin safe from theft? Are you serious? Not if you combine this with ease of use (= very high understanding of tech needed)
   
This is -your- chart, of which little seems to make sense from -my- perspective. If I show your chart to any relative who's not into bitcoin it wouldn't clarify a thing. Giving bitcoin all 4s is, I think, just your way of pretending to be objective.

Well, one argument is that your exports become more attractive when your currency devalues. You cannot do this when everyone is bound to a single currency. argues that this also means imports become extremely expensive, so a country lime Greece (dependent on import) would still be screwed. This means the best solution is more ideological than clear cut.

It has nothing to do with Greece. The community embarrassed itself by showing how little it even knew about the European and Greek situation. Just little boys salivating at actual people with financial problems. None of which is solved by Bitcoin. I would put my euros in a sock if I were Greek. That is what the pensioners are doing. 
@_date: 2015-07-18 07:37:19
I do find it interesting to see that the one factor the Washington Post singles put as the culprit is the ability to devalue ones national currency, or rather the inability to do so within the Euro zone. Wouldn't Bitcoin have this same downside if it were used globally? 
@_date: 2015-07-30 09:21:10
Nothing is stopping the banks and my guess is the market would be flooded by traditional financial products slapped on to bitcoin if it got real mainstream weight. The impact might be less, because compared to buying a gold bar buying a bitcoin is a hell of a lot easier.

And he's wrong. Even Andreessen is using committing a strawman fallacy. Look at it this way: Why would a banker get excited when you say 'look i invented a new currency'? They wouldn't. But now they see it's an entirely new *technology* - bitcoin is the fuel for the network and its' first application: a currency they care little for. Why would they even *mention* that they realize a token is needed for security? That is not the point. They all see the power of the technology now. **That** is why the media narrative changed. They *do* see it now.

I said something about it being silly to donate money to politicians. I said something about not seeing the relation between 'promoting bitcoin' and giving random politicians money. (Something that is promoted quite often on this subreddit). You can ignore my comment, or even disagree, if you think it' is stupid. I don't see why it made you want to go "Ha ha you are stupid".

Well, technically you have received it - the transaction is confirmed. What you mean by 'still nothing' depends on your client I guess? Maybe the client is unable or not done syncing?

It IS a small fucking hole to patch. Like he said, don't overcomplicate things. Anyone in any corporate position paying bills will confirm that you pick up the phone to check if that huge weird transfer is legit. It's not about feeling smarter. It's about being confronted with a company that apparently doesn't even acknowledge their mistake (= being horribly, horribly lax).

P.S. Electrum: I want an easy way to view multiple wallets addresses from within Electrum. Just like my bank allows me to manage multiple accounts from within the same UI with my online banking.

All the more reason not to spend such a large amount of your free money on the wallet. If I only had $600 to save and wanted to have bitcoins I would spend all 600 on bitcoins, not 17% (as it would be in this case!) on buying a wallet to keep those safe. Do you now see how your example only makes me less likely to buy the Trezor? It's relatively expensive unless you are an early adopter sitting on hundreds of coins.

I don't get all the hate it was a nice promotion, that they tried top extend. I do think it's a bit silly that they insist on calling a service disruption "scheduled maintenance". Are they claiming that the marketing team and the tech team never talk together and it really was unexpected and planned at the same time? I really do *hope* it was a technical error or overload, because I wouldn't find **randomly scheduled maintance** on my wallet acceptable at all. In that case Circle, just admit your server keeled over.

I believe the system is and will be self regulating. If higher fees or higher coin value are needed it will come organically. That said, higher fees than we have today makes bitcoin uninteresting for me as a random geeky consumer. My regular bank is pretty cheap and friends already find it weird that I'd have to pay any fees at all to transfer €5 in bitcoin to them.

It's not all that many sales considering the tiny amount of people that buy things using bitcoins. You need an overlap of people using bitcoin, wanting football shirts and wanting to use this particular seller. The site looks horrible and shady. I find it difficult to navigate through a hypothetical order. Eventually I find out that the shipping costs add so much of a money sink that I'm not risking a shady Thailand website.
  
   
I think it's more likely OP is just trying to advertise his struggling t-shirt business, but hey let's upvote because he accepts bitcoin.

One cpu (power) one vote is used in the context of proof of work vs for example giving ip adresss a vote. The whitepaper also mention cpu **power** specifically. To a moderately intelligent reader this obviously includes the possibility of higher processing power. What matters is proof of work. Pretending that whoever wrote the whitepaper was such a big idiot that he didn't see asics and server farms coming is a joke.

They dont remove enough of such shit posts if you ask me. This is a bitcoin subreddit, not everything you can remotely connect to it to jerk off to.
@_date: 2015-03-04 14:41:56
Im curious. Do we know if there are actually 750,000 bitcoins that went missing, or if 750,000 non-existing bitcoins were conjured out of nothing in the MtGox books?
 
  
What are the odds many of those coins (if real) have been offloaded on the market the year? I suppose if I were a hacker I would have offloaded them as much as I could. If Karpeles himself has them, he will probably be holding for another ten years.
@_date: 2017-07-30 15:46:05
My cost base is way below this, so it doesnt feel like a crash. I suppose it does for people eho recently bought in, but most of us will easily hold at this level.

Is it too late to mention that T-Mobile does **not** accept bitcoins for prepaid recharges? **Inpay** accepts them, not T-Mobile. No, this is not the same as T-Mobile using a BTC processor like Bitpay. T-Mobile does *not* accept any form of bitcoin payments. Check the website, check the press release (if you manage to find any).
 
The only thing you can do is buy prepaid T-Mobile time from Inpay, using bitcoins. This is like buying a Gyft card for T-Mobile. It is not T-Mobile itself accepting anything.

Good points. Though speaking for myself I must say that in all my personal use cases $20 would be ridiculously high.

I think the Ver worshippers over at did that all by themselves. Months of atracks, gleeful self importance, cheering of altcoins and generally hating bitcoin. The old r/buttcoin (does it still exist) had nothing on the shouting echo-chamber that is. They lost faith in bitcoin, but instead of merely buying ethereum and moving on they kept bashing what they left behind... like a spiteful boyfriend after a breakup. So now, as it seems another attempt to take over or reboot is failing, I say good riddance. Though I  fear that Roger will just stay invested in bitcoin and pretend that more money = smarter.

Huge fraud magnet *how*? These services are too fucking annoying to use. I don't see any fraudster jumping through these hoops. This is a ridiculous myth that needs to die. Bitcoin is the wet dream of lawmakers everywhere just **because** it is so much more manageable than the actual routes fraudsters use.

I don't know why people keep repeating the no-fee nonsense. The network NEEDS fees to survive. This is bad PR for Bitcoin, because all newcomers I know go 'wtf!?' after seeing this.

Ironic, since he does see how paper money beats gold in that respect:
*' Money, he understood, was a way to facilitate commerce, not a source of national prosperity — and paper money, he argued, allowed commerce to proceed without tying up much of a nation’s wealth in a “dead stock” of silver and gold.*'
This is exactly how Bitcoin is an improvement over fiat currency. He only has to come to realise that.

Probably haha. I can't help but wonder why noone else is creating this product.
@_date: 2013-11-24 14:39:38
That reads quite messy indeed. I think it means you pay 90 cents fee to convert the currency to euros before it processes withdrawal fees. Which then goes as follows: If you withdrew $100 you would get $85 and it depends on the exchange rate howmuch € that makes at the time. This is because the minimum fee is $15. If you withdraw 1000 you would pay 0.09% of $1000, which is 90 cents. In that case you would still pay the minimum fee of $15 and receive receive $985 (- 0.90)
Most exchanges and other bitcoin services so far are more expensive than any banks I've ever been a customer at. It's a good thing the value goes up. Apparantly US banks are robbing their citizens blind - but these fees are outrageous in my mind.
Edit: fixed stupid.
@_date: 2013-12-30 20:59:17

It's not so much trolls as people not understanding the technology. Even some tech websites have no clue what bitcoin is. This generates a great influx of get rich quick speculators.

Kraken follows gox closer, as well as 3rd party instant sellers in Holland. It's an easy arbitrage opportunity. Getting to cheaper BTC is a lot of verification hassle.
@_date: 2013-11-30 21:51:20
That's also what I mean though. Going to the bank in person doesn't feel safe for me. What value does a bank teller offer me over online banking? Nothing. Their job has no meaning to me. It's someone that apparantly can touch my money and move it around. That doesn't make me feel safe at all. To each his own I suppose : )

From the information youve given us I honestly have no idea.

It's not a fantasy. Agree with him? Hah. The **entire financial system is a bubble**. There is too much debt and not enough actual money. We are playing a game of hot potato on a scale so massive that nobody sees the game for what it is! The only thing making it stable is the threat of collapse. That is the interest that those issueing and holding debt have. It truly is too big too fail, until one day, one generation - it will implode and drag many of us down.
I believe any economist honestly thinking that what we've done to money the past 100 years is healthy financial policy is either lacking economic insight, or only in it for his own gain. Perhaps this *stability* will last many years after our deaths, but I contend that it is more like the threat of nuclear mutual destruction than healthy currency backing.

@_date: 2013-12-27 11:04:37
Actually, in 2009 in the Netherlands it cost 32 eurocents for an electronic payment. This amount covers both fees and seller costs like equipment. As the study says (  banking in the Netherlands is very cheap. Im sure for the US the competition for Bitcoin will be much easier. As it is now though, dutch banks and merchant payment options have an easy win against bitcoin unless fees go down.
@_date: 2013-12-26 09:17:00
In the Netherlands for example this is not an issue. We hardly use credit cards. I can pay electronicly using a debit card via a handheld that the waiter carries. We've had this for many years now. So I don't see bitcoin taking over payments here.

That's a hell of a lot to me. (Dutch) banks would easily win a fee war if that's accurate. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 04:45:36
You can spend any fraction. There are currently no 'cents' and 'nickels' in Bitcoin and there is some discussion about the cognitive and psychological barriers of reading in fractional amounts: i.e. 0.001345 for a cup of coffee. It remains to be seen how this is resolved, but there is no technical problem there. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 16:35:03

The mass majority in **any** field, in particular while studying, will reject a revolution. They do not see it because they are being taught the **past**. There will be some among them who do see it. They will be the ones driving the future. Asking many students for an average vision is getting an overview of history, it's not a look of the future at all.

No, the point is exactly what he made. That those safekeeping your money are in the best position to steal. It doesn't matter in what country you see this happen first. The point is we see it now. It's not about being in a 'good hands', it's about someone else but you controlling your money. That's what I took from it.

I don't find it explains the fundamentals very well. Practically and price-wise my dutch bank account still kicks Bitcoins' ass. So I think the fundamentals need more spotlight.

A stock market "correction" is a 10% drop. So yes, technically there was a correction. You want to change the word correction to mean crash instead,
@_date: 2013-11-30 22:33:50
All this effort sure shows how much in need of change the banking system is.
@_date: 2013-11-01 13:30:11
Hey, I just 'popped' my BTC cherry as well. I have to say it was a nervous ordeal. It's strange.. you have to step outside of the financial world you know - to buy into this currency. It's hard to explain what I mean... but it took me actually -doing it-, like you said, to be able to reflect on what was actually happening. It was scary at first, but now it makes sense. Just like going to the exchange office when you go on summer holidays.
@_date: 2013-11-30 23:44:49
**You can't trust anyone.**
Correct. You are your own bank. How do you propose to solve this? Traditional banking is based on trusting a third party. Bitcoin is based on NOT trusting a third party.
**no charge backs/ refunds**
Charge backs are stupid. Do you *really* use those? You shouldn't need them when merchants give you refunds. In the Netherlands they have to offer refunds by law. You don't need a chargeback mechanism for that. Charge backs are bad for merchants. We need merchant adoption. People have argued this quite often instead of downvoting it.
Again, getting a *refund* is not a feature of a financial system is it?
This goes back to  You cannot trust anymore. The same goes for any other business, be it with dollars, mortgages, or anything really. Not all people can be trusted. I don't think any of this is being shoved under the rug. It's just a reality of life. That, and people are more likely to let themselves be scammed if they eagerly jump into a get rich quick scheme.
**Buying coin**
The fact that buying coin is hard says more about the traditional banking system than 'the state of bitcoin'. People *are* shouting this from the rooftops. Hell, in my country banks block some payments if they see you want to purchase Bitcoins with it. **That** is the serpent eating its own tail.
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:49:30

@_date: 2013-12-27 11:55:40
The 20 cent bitcoin is without other operating costs (electricity, equipment, etc). The 20 cents was also mentioned to go higher, while the dutch processing fees are likely to drop even lower.
Finally, the 32 cents is a proven, efficient system that we've been using for over 10 years for everything from buying cars to cups of coffee. It's not a level playing field. I only see idealists jumping aboard in this environment. Both practically and financially our system is quite lean as it is.
Edit: yes im aware of dollar vs euro, but I think thats less important than my reasons above.

An actual thought out discussion of Bitcoin!
I must say a lot of her comments go over my head. I wholeheartedly disagree with her about the distrubition of wealth though. It doesn't matter for society who the millionaires are. Noone will be late to the party. (Even) If Bitcoin became that big, we would still receive salary from our work and pay the same bills as always. Just maybe with different money.
I guess about the 'price' of the network (why not cheaper) I can say one thing. There could have been 21 trillion coins and each unit would be cheaper. This doesn't matter. The point is that in the end the free market determines a transaction price. The same would happen to an initially 'cheaper' altcoin. How I understand the blockchain, the same equilibrium in value for units and transactions would be achieved eventually - depending on how big of a demand there is. Compare the dollar to a swedish crown. If the swedish crown (the alt currency for comparison) needed to support a trillion dollar economy it would likewise grow in both value and number of units (or divisions).
