Thank you! I wish I could gold you, but I can't as that'd give away who I was and I wish to remain anon about this stuff. ~~I will read this post from my real account so if I read guilding is anon I will do it~~ actually I won,t sorry. Not a dick but just trying to make sure everything on that side is that side, this side is this side. Can't afford to ever mix the streams...but maybe, one day, when you get a random gold for the dumbest, worst comment - who knows..maybe it was OnlyGonnaPostThis1x, maybe not. Maybe it was your mom?.
I read your post yesterday after having continuous issues with setting up a bitcoin account. I was able to finally get an account going with Coinbase though I still tried with others.
Once my account was good with Coinbase, I purchased $1300 worth of BC. The message I got backed "Your bitcoins will be deposited in 9 days." 9 may not be the exact number but the number was bullshit anyways. I wanted them now.
No need for Coinbase to collect funds, earn interest of those funds, all while charging fees to hold the funds for X days while they collect interest on your money.
So, after reading your post yesterday  I found multiple locations for LibertyX in my area (Austin Texas). Whalla bitches, I put 700$ into two wallets today. 
No id was required when I bought the libertyX, the wallets I entered went straight to DNM - no tumbling, no concerns about anon, and immediate.
The deposits into Evolution took about an hour, don't know why - I'm very new at this so not sure of rules or what not. That said. I got my orders placed today. I'm very grateful, if I hadn't read this post I'd still be waiting for Coinbase to deliver...and worrying about "do I tumble, can they track me, can XYZ."
LibertyX is the way to go.
