I became aware of and jumped into bitcoin after the January 2014 rally, when the price jumped from roughly $100/BTC to a peak of over $1000/BTC.  After that peak of over $1000/BTC, it wasn’t until January of 2017 that we reached $1000/BTC again.  2014, 2015, and 2016 saw prices range between roughly $200/BTC and $600/BTC.
When I decided to purchase bitcoin, I did it with the thought that it was possible bitcoin could crash to zero or nearly zero, but that it was more likely that the technology would catch hold and bitcoin would become quite valuable.  I started buying my own bitcoin near the top of that January 2014 rally, and I believe my first purchase was when the price was $800/BTC.  I kept buying as the price came down through 2014.  During this investing, I decided that I needed to pick an amount of money I was willing to completely lose and stop there.  I decided on 5% of my net worth at the time.  At some point in the doldrums of 2014 and 2015, I had invested that amount of money into bitcoin, and I didn’t buy any more.  After that, I sat on it.  I’m sure there were weeks that went by that I didn’t check the price.  Things got more exciting in 2017, and the end of 2017 was absolute madness.  I have certainly been caught up in the madness like everyone else and checking the price frequently.  At this point part of me wishes I sold some at the peak of $20k/BTC, but I had no actual way to know that would be the top.  I still haven’t sold any bitcoin to date.
The pep talk I am giving myself, and anyone still reading, is to be patient.  I didn’t get into bitcoin to day trade and make a fast buck.  I got into bitcoin because I saw an emerging technology that could become huge, and I invested with the thought that it was high risk, but a smart risk with a huge potential upside.  That turned out to be true over the 4 years that I have been in bitcoin so far, and I still believe it is true.  However, I do not expect to see $20k/BTC again next month, or even in 2018.  It is possible the price will recover in that time frame.  After the January 2014 peak, however, it took 3 years to hit $1000/BTC again.
My one regret after I invested 5% of my net worth was that I didn’t set up any automatic purchases.  I would be in great shape if I had automatically been investing a bit of my paycheck into bitcoin every two weeks through 2015, 2016, and 2017.  I am putting my own money where my mouth is and committing to buying a small amount of bitcoin every two weeks from now on.  I am not going to attempt to day trade or speculate, as I believe that will result in worse returns than patiently buying and holding for the average Joe like me.
Be patient, invest what you can afford to lose and don't need access to within the next 5 years, and enjoy the ride.  I am confident we will reach and exceed that all-time high, but I will not assume it will happen quickly.

That was my understanding - your coinbase account has amounts of BTC and BCH based on coins you held prior to the fork.  Once you use some of that balance as BCH, you would lose the equivalent in BTC.
edit* I was wrong, and now I know, thanks to many helpful redditors :)

Thanks, and please be patient with me while I try to understand.
So, 1BTC acquired before the BCH hard fork is equal to 1BTC + 1BCH?  And not equal to 1BTC or 1BCH?
Is this the same whether the BTC was held on an exchange or in an offline wallet?

Thanks!  Anyone with expertise on recovering BCH and BTC from the same paper wallet, your input would be much appreciated.
I will do more googling on it in the mean time :)

Dunno, hope someone chimes in with some information rather than just downvoting :(

So say I have been using Coinbase for a while, and my BTC balance is the same, but now I have the same amount in BCH as well.  Did they give me free BCH?

Thanks for the help!
Say I have a paper wallet with .25BTC, and Coinbase is the exchange I use.  I could transfer .25BTC from the paper wallet onto Coinbase, and after that, I could also transfer .25BCH from the same paper wallet onto Coinbase?  There are no complications or problems with doing this?
I am just trying to fully understand how to handle the BCH I didn't know I had offline.

Could you point me to some reading material to understand this better?  It doesn't make sense to me that they gave away free money for simply having BTC held in the exchange. 
As for old BTC that I purchased on coinbase but moved offline long ago, no special freebies there, right?
