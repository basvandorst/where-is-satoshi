CryptoWoo is acting as a payment gateway for [WooCommerce]( a widely used e-commerce plugin for [WordPress]( WooCommerce has fairly good support for product variations and tax calculations out of the box and there are lots of extensions for special cases, e.g. country specific regulations.  
Would you tell me a little more about your setup with mycelium? How are you using it to accept payments on a website?
@_date: 2015-12-26 20:26:22
  
It's a paid plugin though. I don't believe in half-baked "lite" versions that require additional maintenance and are disappointing to users most of the time.  
To get a better picture you can check out the [screenshots]( on the website and play with the demo at  Of course, also feel free to ask any questions here or via PM.
@_date: 2015-12-26 20:16:25
Yes, it's open source. We're selling tiered licenses that give access to the initial download as well as support and updates for one year, so there's no public repo I can point you to. Feel free to check out the demo at  though or ask if you want to know more.

If you are ok with using WooCommerce you should have a look at CryptoWoo. It does exactly what you want. We had a successful beta over the last year and began to soft launch 2 weeks ago. Check it out and let me know if you have any questions!

i have never been in the situation to find out (and hopefully i will never get there)  
but i guess that banks do not always reimburse you the money you lost in online fraud. a search on some terms turned up this:

The more platform independent the code is the harder it becomes to create a smooth experience during the payment process. So we focused on one platform to not only give the merchant more control over his coins but to also allow a deeper integration into the WooCommerce order process.

this is called cloaking. you redirect the ad approval team to another website than the people clicking on the live ad. you can achieve this by filtering the hits on your ad via various footprinting methods like referrer, IP, user agent and so on.  
@_date: 2014-03-24 11:39:09
Is it a good idea to send all traffic over the TOR network? Most of the websites with sensible data are SSL encrypted anyway, but wouldn't it pose a risk that some node operator can read what I typed if it wasn't? 
@_date: 2014-12-13 21:57:25
[There is]( It's an open source plugin for WordPress/WooCommerce. We are currently testing a beta version with selected merchants. Message me if you want to give it a try!
@_date: 2014-03-24 11:27:25
it's not that easy because at least the big ad companies know about it and use different and changing footprints aka homeoffice employees with different browsers.  
 but it is (obviously) possible to collect enough data to filter out most of the approval team checks even if that means missing out on potential "clients" for the malvertiser.
@_date: 2014-03-24 14:03:36
yeah sure they make it get approved but you are risking your advertising account and face even more problems if you use such a service for spreading malware or phishing attacks.

I'm working on a direct integration of BTC, LTC, and DOGE payments in WooCommerce. [The plugin]( is currently in beta but feel free to check it out and get back to me if you want to give it a try!

I get the point you're making here. You're right as in bitcoin there is no institution that compensates you for being defrauded. On the other hand bitcoin is more like a mix of cash and online banking transactions (often referred to as "digital cash") and if your wallet (the one holding your fiat cash as well as the wallet holding cryptocurrency) gets stolen/lost it's your fault and no one will compensate you for that.   
  
I (luckily) don't have any first- or second-hand experience with online fraud. My opinion is just based on reading the terms of an online banking account and seeing the possibilities for the bank to get around compensation by referring to their terms. If they are quite lax with it (because they know how insecure their systems are), good for the customer. It's a service that they have priced into their banking/account holding fees.    
This is a business model for any cryptocurrency wallet service that will charge their customers for holding their digital currency with covering any fraudulent activity as the traditional fiat banks are doing.

isn't it the same with online banking?   use your brain and don't click on everything you see.
@_date: 2014-12-13 22:21:34
The benefits depend on the merchant's requirements. For some it may be easier and more convenient than handling the coins themselves. 
@_date: 2014-03-24 11:51:32
that is a reason. but then you click the ad?

@_date: 2014-03-24 12:40:04
even if that means telling an unknown party what you are doing, in this case, potentially giving someone a free copy of your (encrypted) wallet? why not another distro with an optional TOR connection? 
@_date: 2015-01-14 17:05:02
I see. Even though I haven't had an issue with the WooCommerce emails yet, this feature becomes more interesting the more I think about it. I'll put it on the list...  


That's great! Will PM you some details soon.

Not sure if there is anything specific with Trezor's address creation, but we are planning support for master public keys of BIP39 wallets to create the payment addresses, thus giving the option to have the coins go directly into cold storage.
@_date: 2015-01-14 15:28:19
Yes, we will implement JSON-RPC functionality in a future version. Since there are already some solutions for this out there, we thought it would make more sense to start out with a focus on something where the merchant doesn't need to run a node for every coin he wants to accept.

I'm not sure if I understand - Do you mean that you want the order confirmations which are normally sent to the store owner via mail to be available via RSS feed so the store owner can trigger actions after payments by hooking that feed to something like ifttt or yahoo pipes?  
@_date: 2015-01-12 16:44:13
Unfortunately not. I'm currently looking for another developer to speed up the process, so if you know someone experienced in creating WordPress/WooCommerce plugins that will accept payment in BTC or DOGE I'd be really thankful if you could get me in touch with that person.
@_date: 2016-01-24 09:57:49
As others already said, brute force is your option. Try the BIP39 wordlist for your language:    
@_date: 2015-01-14 16:08:45
Thanks for the info. I'll check it out.   


Even though we will offer options that don't go "full measure" on this point (for merchants that need to have the coins on an exchange as fast as possible), the main drive for this project is to make better use of the technology and enable a higher degree of "be your own payment processor" than the current solutions provide.  


The code will be open source and I'm sure you can get it for free some time after release, but we will sell licenses that give access to support, security updates, and new features.     
  


As far as the plugin installation is concerned, definitely yes. I want to have some kind of "minimum knowledge" option where you basically just have to enter API keys and the address you want the payments to be forwarded to and use default values on all other options. Using more advanced features like for example creating a deterministic wallet on an offline computer to use it in combination with the plugin will not become easier though.

Creator of [CryptoWoo]( here. It's still in beta, but I'd be happy to receive your feedback. Let me know if you want to give it a try!
@_date: 2016-02-26 21:50:17
Thanks for the shoutout, Olav. That is indeed correct. The next release will allow merchants to connect to an instance of the [Insight API]( an open-source block explorer which they can run next to their own full node. This will remove the remaining third party dependencies from the payment process.
@_date: 2016-02-27 12:46:34
Not at the moment. My focus lies more on providing a seamless experience than platform independence. It's a trade-off because I don't have the manpower to properly maintain both implementations.
However, it is possible to build off of it, so if there is someone that wants to create and maintain a fork please reach out to me and we'll see what we can do.
@_date: 2016-02-02 14:36:37
Although I like Mycelium Gear and how it lets you accept payments to your own addresses it's not easy to use with an existing e-commerce platform.  
CryptoWoo completely integrates into existing WooCommerce stores and works alongside the other payment methods, which results in a much better shopping experience for the customer and an improved workflow for the merchant.

@_date: 2015-04-18 22:32:23
Which e-commerce platform are you using? 
@_date: 2015-09-25 21:43:24
I don't really follow the issues with other CMSs, so I can't compare it, but I guess the popularity of WP and WooCommerce (~30% of webshops use it) at least makes sure that there are a lot of eyes on the code. Other, less popular solutions may have issues that stay undiscovered. Additionally, you can lock down WP quite well.  
The plugin itself works with block.io, but I am also offering an addon that adds support for xpub keys and uses blockcypher for payment processing. It's still a work in progress, so there are some rough edges, but the basic functionality works fine.   
@_date: 2015-04-18 23:15:07
Be aware that you have to trust blockchain.info to forward the payments to you when you use this method.  
I am working on a solution that uses multisignature addresses from block.io as payment addresses. It's a WooCommerce plugin and it also supports DOGE and LTC. Check out keys4coins.com for an example of a keystore running the current beta.  
@_date: 2015-09-25 19:11:44
If you are okay with using WordPress and WooCommerce you could accept payments with [CryptoWoo]( It's still in beta, but it's being used in production on a couple sites since the beginning of the year.  
Check out keys4coins.com or shibeseeds.com for live examples and let me know if you want to give it a try! (it's my project)

Creator of CryptoWoo here. Thanks for your feedback. My takeaway is that we have to rework the landing page.   
CryptoWoo is not a payment processor at all. The point of this project is to enable merchants to process payments *themselves*.   
The payment addresses generated by the multisig wallets of Block.io give merchants much more control over their private keys while not having to run a full node for every coin they want to accept in their store.   
The plugin also protects the privacy of the store customers by not handing over email addresses and payment info to large payment processors that (are legally required to) accumulate huge loads of sensible data in one central place.   
Some merchants may also want to exchange let's say all DOGE and LTC revenue to BTC as fast as possible. Using an online wallet service to generate the payment addresses instead of generating addresses with a cold storage setup like electrum or trezor gives the opportunity to automatically convert "unwanted" coins, for example via auto-selling on an exchange.   
Do you really think something like this wouldn't be useful or was it a misconception about the features of the plugin?
