BUT is it worth it ? Worth it like "I will spend 1000$" for a first investment and I will profit to expand or just a couple of dollars after a year?
Could you give some real numbers please ?

Thank you for your reply! I know that for it to be profitable I have to acquire much more knowledge, for instance the numbers you gave I've  already tough of them :) And where I live the electricity can be quite expensive.
Remind me of this but asking here for a better place (website nor forum) is forbidden meaning you cannot refer another website right ? If not please elucidate me . 
Thank you and sorry for the smiles they are reflex

I unfortunately did not invest (cause I always have been poor has fuck ) but I can see a black Friday incoming . . With people saying "lets sell at 3k" . . guys do you know that if everyone sells at the same time there are no buyers and you all are screwed to the point were you loose everything . .
I am not an expert but I would say that you better sell some now, like 50% of the initial investment nor that you go selling at a slow peace. But don't wait for milestones to sell it ~.
I wish the biggest luck for all of you guys !!!

Yes, I never said this before because even thou I don't have BTC I, since they worth "just" 10€ have been looking up to its implementation in the market. I could have said it long ago but I didn't. The only motive I said it at 3k and now was because someone, on this very topic was saying that it would be a great idea for everyone to sell it at 3k. Obviously if everyone did it you would just ruin the whole system xD I was pin-pointing that matter of fact, BTC will not crash has easily has dollar nor euro. Too much black market involved, too much normal people involved.. BTC is starting to make his own world :)
