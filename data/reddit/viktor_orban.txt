Your opinion is just as worthless as those people's opinion. 
Ignore people like u/purplefruit12, because they don't have any idea what they're talking about!

Does anybody knows what happened with Coinbase Pro's websites layout? Until yesterday the 'depth chart' was visible under the 'price chart'. Is there a way to restore the 'old' layout? Is it a new design or am I just plain stupid?

It was a bit early, I guess..

I use Coinbase and GDAX. It's the same company. Coinbase is for noobs and GDAX is for advanced users. You can send your funds free between the two.

You know what's boring?! Reading your meaningless comment. 
@_date: 2018-02-17 19:26:34
Oh, sorry! My brain is all over the place! Sure, I meant Coinbase! Damn

Well, I was 'lecture' you in a sarcastic way. I hope you understand what I meant and that you got a better vision about what's going on here. Nobody knows nothing! You shouldn't ask such question. That's the main principal. Everybody acting like they know things for sure, but they are all guessing. So, you'll never find the true answer to your question. Everyone is just speculating. There's no exact knowledge about btc prices, it's a guessing game.

What's wrong is your lack of understanding, and that you're looking for advise on reddit to 'invest'! ..not to mention that you have asked the most stupid question that you could ask, mr. investor. To answer your stupid question: the dip is exactly at 6941638 rubel!

I read a lot of bad reviews as well before I signed up. All the exchanges has the same negative reviews everywhere. I desided to go with coinbase and I didn't had any problems with them. I really like the android app as well. Nice and easy to use. I know your feelings pretty well. I went through it myself ��
