@_date: 2018-01-09 01:29:39


No, I'm not confusing it. We are talking about the same notion of social consensus. You know, miners are part of the same *society*. They are people. I'm talking about the human beings who make the decision to run that software and hardware. They interact with the rest of us *economically* (among other ways). Economics is a *social* science, you know. They own bitcoins like the rest of us. In fact, they do something more than the rest of us do (and I'm not saying that this elevates them to some level of hegemony over us)! They are the only ones who invest resources in the present so that the blockchain is being extended in the future, and *securely* so. Bitcoin doesn't function without such people. If you try to change the rules in a way unacceptable to them, they simply won't mine under such rules - they'd stick to the current rules for which there is existing agreement on. One would think that you'd care if the Bitcoin you propose would be *functional*, and therefore care to take into account the miners' opinion. A mechanism which does so is already there, and it's called miner signalling, and there has to be a supermajority.
When it comes to the success of Bitcoin, miners have as much incentives as the rest of us, if not more.


Don't put words in my mouth. I'm not some fool who thinks that just one group, *any* one group of Bitcoin stakeholders, can dictate consensus rule changes. It takes both miners and other people who can use the currency. You can't change the rules without the users and you can't change them without the miners.

We were talking about the principles of soft forks in general, and the situation with SegWit *before* the miners locked in another soft fork just in time to save the UASF users from losing their bitcoins due to this vulnerability. You are now trying to focus specifically on the situation with SegWit *after* the miners intervened with a majority of hashpower, and the situation was as certain as any other normal soft fork before.


They could have just as easily not done any of this and potentially gotten free bitcoins.
Why trick users into throwing their money at the mercy of the miners by advocating for UASF? UASF users got away unharmed this time, but if the same thing is attempted again it could be a disaster for them. If the UASF users simply ran a normal soft fork activation with a 80% miner signalling threshold that the miners ran, they would have gotten the same result but without being at risk.


Sounds like you are trying to exclude miners from the consensus about rules. And their voice is the only one that can be objectively and reliably measured, through signalling in blocks. Miners are part of the Bitcoin system, you know. How could you talk about consensus while excluding not even just some of them, you try to exclude all of them?
Go ahead, try to argue that proof of work does not play a role in the consensus and enforcement of rules, and let's see how that goes. Make a fool of yourself.

How could it be "stealing" if some users misplace their money where anyone could appropriate it for themselves, after basically being told not to do it in our Bitcoin system yet, and that a majority of miners and other people don't yet *agree* to start enforcing a proposed form of ownership that never existed? This is what the lack of miner signalling really tells users. You can't "steal" something which is not even considered *property* yet. If you pretend to own it anyway and then lose it, don't ask others to enforce your not-agreed-to property right. This is common sense.


Miners would mine what they've always mined, the original Bitcoin blockchain with the existing rules *for which there is consensus*, and not enforce the proposed new rule. They'll only start enforcing proposed new consensus rules if a large supermajority of them agree to, and coordinate properly. It is called a "consensus rule" for a reason.
If anything, reckless users misplacing their bitcoins would add an extra incentive to mine only the original blockchain, because the miners are in a good position to appropriate for themselves those misplaced bitcoins there. They would function as an extra mining reward on the original blockchain.

As I wrote in that topic, a Proof of Prediction application would need to include some more elements. What I proposed was to use a dedicated Bitcoin keypair for authentication. Distribute a Bitcoin address to all the parties you want to convince of your good predictions and sign all your predictions from it. It's also compatible with a pseudonymous identity - that identity could gain reputation through repeated good predictions.
For those who verify predictions the application would look up all prediction-containing transactions for that address and if there is any prediction that has not been revealed by its "reveal by" date (an extra field in the OP_RETURN data perhaps) then the predictor is considered untrustworthy. Ultimately a predictor can prove what all his predictions are and that he has not cheated.

We **don't know**, and that's as huge a deal as you think it is. But it has nothing to do with off-chain transactions. Even if they do on-chain transactions between customers there are still ways they could run a de-facto fractional reserve system (particularly with the more opaque fiat part of the holdings, but also by secretly encumbering customers' bitcoins) which can blow up in an instant (meaning, one minute everyone sees all their exchange held bitcoins on the blockchain and the next it's all transferred, or no longer theirs legally). I don't know for sure that any of the exchanges and their operators would even be necessarily breaking any law if they did something like that.
Exchanges could in theory gain enough trustworthiness by e.g. at least promising in their contracts that they won't do any of the above, have regular proofs-of-reserve for their bitcoin part and full audits for their whole operation and having courts, insurers and other third parties to guarantee all of this and by having individuals who are personally liable for anything that may go wrong. It wouldn't necessarily require on-blockchain transactions (although it can help in some schemes)!

How about we let everyone decide for themselves how much weight they want to put on their own vote? There is a problem of determining exactly how much one knows about something compared to others so instead of introducing a test let people put at risk something they already have (wealth, reputation, time etc). Let them risk as much of their own wealth as they think is justified based on their own assessment of their own knowledge on the subject. Wealth is something which is limited and people already are motivated and try to defend it against manipulation, whereas the potential for various types of bias and manipulations of tests, which are impossible to be created perfect in the first place, is unfathomable. People are motivated not to risk too much or too little of their wealth on things which concern them, so the weighing is self-correcting. Note, however, that people don't have the right to vote in favor of things which directly limit or infringe on other people's rights.
So basically the major portion of today's legislation which concerns spending money and regulating the economy can be replaced with free markets.

I'm sorry, I don't understand what you mean by "bandwidth" and "bandwidth burden" then. Bandwidth literally means maximum throughput (as one meaning).


My point is that with decreasing the block interval the stale block rate becomes *less evenly distributed* among miners. Even as it is, there is a small unevenness of stale rates based on location (relative to other miners) alone. The original design of Bitcoin has made this fundamental tradeoff (consciously or not) with this centralizing tendency. Decreasing the block interval, unlike increasing the block size limit, makes this particular phenomenon worse. If it ever becomes significant market forces would produce a situation where most miners congregate to a small geographical area, which creates very significant risks for the network.
@_date: 2015-06-23 08:35:08


It is not evenly distributed even for the purposes of miner income. [In a post below]( I argue that a significant decrease in the block interval can exacerbate this unevenness to the point where miners centralize geographically, which puts the whole network at very significant risks even without an attack going on.

If you want to reuse a word with a different meaning you should at least make sure that the two meanings don't interfere with each other.
Bitcoins, as other forms of money, (e.g. gold) are not created by lending something to particular borrowers who have agreed beforehand to pay something back in the future. In economic context, credit has traditionally meant trust or faith in particular persons' promises.
The intellectual, philosophical and practical business use of the word credit (in its meanings related to economics) as something related yet distinct from money is so vast that it would be very arrogant and disrespectful towards that heritage to start using that same root word in a way that creates a conflict with that heritage.
Syntactically it is OK and we will probably see the development of more advanced peer-to-peer credit systems in the near future where this exact word may be needed and appropriate.

I don't see how it can decrease the bandwidth requirement, if anything it increases it a little due to protocol overhead. Even ignoring that, there is a fundamental way in which reducing the interval increases geographical centralization.
A significantly shorter interval increases a miner's losses due to orphaned blocks. This is oversimplifying a bit, but if **I** is the nominal interval between blocks, **U** - time to *upload* a block and **L** - connection latency, then the loss due to orphans is proportional to **(U+L)/I**. Suppose we change **I** and **U** changes with the same factor. For U&gt;&gt;L it doesn't make much of a difference for losses due to orphans. But if we decrease **I** a lot (even 10 times) then **L** may become a significant contributor to losses. Latency is physically limited by the speed of light, therefore the ultimate way to reduce it significantly would be for miners to relocate closer to each other, thus incentivizing geographical centralization. In milder cases - just further disincentivizing the use of TOR (even just for its latency and ignoring the effect of its lower bandwidth).

Giving the advice you gave for a secret for a key derivation scheme (such as Electrum seeds and brainwallets, where there is no secret material beyond the seed/passphrase) for Bitcoin (where every address holding money is publicly known from the blockchain) is a particularly irresponsible thing to do, since an attacker can attack everyone who follows such a bad advice *at the same time*, thus multiplying their chance of finding bitcoins to steal. The attacker would only need publicly available information to start - not even encrypted wallets as in your case.
Should I bring up this well known example again: ( Making fancy alterations doesn't help much either: (
An attacker could start with some big digital library, such as [Project Gutenberg]( or [Google Books]( Even the free preview usually (if not always) makes the beginning of the first chapter freely available. This kind of stuff, of course, gets automated. There are, of course, many people who have unrestricted access to all books in various such libraries and databases, which would make it almost certain that your obscure book is in there and can be used, unless it is not published yet. Even if it is *that* obscure, don't make it tempting for someone to invade your home and start going through your library. The number of books written in history [estimated at 130 million by Google]( is certainly within what can be bruteforced in a reasonable amount of time.
I suggest you use a scheme such as [diceware]( or Electrum seeds (you can use Electrum just to generate a random seed and simply use it as a passphrase if you prefer to store your bitcoins elsewhere), i.e. actual random words that are not written or stored anywhere outside human brains.
Electrum uses [a dictionary of 1626 common English words](
P.S.: When changing your passphrase you might want to create a new wallet, unless you are sure that you can securely destroy all existing copies of the wallet that are encrypted with the old passphrase. Also, don't destroy copies or move coins to a new wallet before you are sure that you remember the new password (test your memory a few times through a period of a few days).

The fact that the second and [the third one]( got unlocked in almost exactly the same amount of time (the third one took only about 0.57%, or 124 seconds longer, judging by the timestamps at blockchain.info) suggests that those two were most likely unlocked by the same machine and claimed by the same person.
Using the smallest difference in timestamps (first and second) we can make a rather precise estimate of the hashing power being used:
86400000000/((1401952479000-1401930562000)/1000) = **3 942 145 hashes/s**

Everything that exists in one **spacetime** continuum works better when decentralized. In fact, this is the natural order of things. Centralized structures can only make sense for a limited period of time.
You see, in our universe everything, even the most basic thing - *information* - is limited in its effects by the time it takes to travel distances (the absolute limit is the speed of light in vacuum). Therefore any centralization would mean that the information about whatever is being centrally controlled would have to travel a distance to wherever the center is, be processed, and then travel back. Therefore this situation is less efficient (in time and energy spent) than a situation in which the information didn't have to travel as much, or at all.
This is the basic explanation and it works at all levels.

I like Tails' feature that erases RAM on shutdown.
A use case that I think will be very important for many would be creating offline wallets and signing offline transactions. If we make a light and small distro appropriate for old hardware (128 or 256MB RAM minimum; should fit on a 700MB CD) it would be easy enough for anyone, even in a third world country, to get a literally dirt-cheap spare PC for this purpose. One could use that offline PC along with their online PC when signing offline transactions so that no complicated reboot procedure is necessary (in a single PC situation for security reasons you would want to disconnect the harddrive(s), network cables or cards, etc. before booting the live CD and then reconnecting everything again afterwards). A USB drive or other writable media would be required only for transferring the transaction to be signed and then broadcast.
This could make an extremely cheap and very secure setup that would also be relatively easy to learn and use. It's like cold storage that you can easily use day-to-day and still keep it cold.
As mentioned, Electrum and some other useful software and tools, such as brainwallet.org, blockchain.info's My-Wallet, pywallet, pybitcointools, diceware, should also be added. Some packages that take significant space should be removed to make it fit on a single 700MB CD. It should be based on a highly trusted distribution and all the changes should be easy to check. Ideally it would be easy for inexperienced people to securely download, verify and build the whole thing.

Ultimately you need to remember all the elements of it, and computationally it makes almost no difference how you arrange the elements. The arrangement itself contains some additional information and that means additional complexity but also need to remember it and *risk of screwing something up*^1. The simplified model is: private key=KDF(passphrase,[salt],iterations) (see [key derivation function]( where salt is optional and not secret (e.g. e-mail address) and the passphrases contains all the secret information that you need to remember. You could simply concatenate all the elements and create one big passphrase.

If you're going to stretch keys for brainwallets, you better stretch them ***really*** well, not just twice better than before. You need to stretch them as far as is practically feasible or convenient. You measure that by the time and/or resources it would take to generate the private key on the least powerful hardware you envision might need to be used. E.g. if you think that a smartphone user shouldn't have to wait more than 1 second and waste more than 1% of the battery on deriving the private key from the passphrase, you calculate how much hashing can be done in those constraints and use that much hashing. For example that meant hundreds of thousands of iterations of SHA-256 for modern hardware *before the introduction of SHA-256 ASICs*. Now you would probably prefer an algorithm that is hard to implemented in ASIC (see **WarpWallet** 
Maybe one day there will be one universal standard for a proof of work function and all computing devices will contain dedicated efficient hardware for it, so that users and would-be attackers would be on equal footing and simply mining coins would be preferred over attacking stuff. Then you could use whatever that function is and you will be able to more accurately estimate: 1. how many iterations you would need to make attacks infeasible for a certain relatively weak passphrase; and 2. how costly it would be to use that relatively weak passphrase in terms of the opportunity cost of simply *mining* instead of wasting time and resources deriving your private key.
Edit: ^1 Actually it **was screwed up all along**, only I didn't notice immediately.

If someone attempted selfish mining, everyone would be able to see a sudden spike in the orphan block rate ([chart of the number of orphaned blocks per day, starting in March 2014, at blockchain.info]( to a large percentage of all valid blocks mined, most likely starting right after a difficulty retarget, then this would go on through the next retarget (at least 3-4 weeks, depending on the attacker's share), and only then would the attacker see their revenue increase in BTC terms (still being in the red, even in BTC terms)
Selfish mining would be brazenly obvious long before the attacker can see any profit.
Furthermore, BTC exchange rate would fall if only for the decreased usability due to having to wait *much* longer before considering transactions irreversible, perhaps hours, which would further disincentivize the attack.

If by "cash" you mean fiat money, you would still be paying a sort of a tax. Storing cash means paying the inflation tax and giving value to the currency that the central bank issues, and central banks have proven to be more than willing to fund governments (no big surprise there). It doesn't make much of a difference to governments - they are still funded. Therefore, a tax revolt in a world without cryptocurrencies would have to involve other decentralized forms of money, like precious metals.
But that is besides your main point. Archeologists and treasure hunters know that there are tons of secret gold and silver coin stashes that were buried during the later years of empires such as the Roman empire. There is no question that it is possible to effectively prevent seizure of physical wealth in this way already. Cryptocurrencies' disruptive contribution in this respect is not so much in making secret wealth stores possible, but in making them very accessible to everyone, very efficient, convenient, and allowing a whole lot more than just storing wealth. You can easily add more to your stash without risking revealing it to someone who might try to steal it. It is becoming increasingly difficult to hide physical wealth securely enough and it is ridiculous to have to deal with this sort of things in the 21st century. Cryptocurrencies allow you to spend with less hassle and less worries, very low friction, very high efficiency. They allow you to protect your identity better, if desired. Transporting it couldn't be easier (I carry my wallet seed in my head).
In short, cryptocurrencies allows you to continue business without being disturbed by governments, or whoever, run amok. That to me is their great contribution in allowing this scenario to happen.

I think you probably have errors or insufficiencies in your first quiz. Probably more than one.
I can see evidence of this from some questions, e.g. from section 1, question 10: "ASCII code: 73". If we interpreted the number 73 as decimal, we get a capital letter "I", which is invalid in base58, therefore it must be hexadecimal, which would conventionally be denoted as "0x73" or in some other way that distinguishes it from decimal. Other examples are in section 4, questions 2 and 4, where it is unclear whether we should use last or first names. I would assume last, but if there is even a little ambiguity or uncertainty for each question, it adds up exponentially over 50-odd questions that you have to all answer precisely, at the same time.
Unfortunately, the second quiz doesn't look much more promising to me.

"CoinBits" is certainly better than the "bits" proposal, although this isn't saying much, since almost anything would be better than something deceptive, including the well known proposals of "MicroBitcoins" or "MicroBits". I think "CoinBits" is a somewhat better name than "MicroBits", since it is:
* pronounced as only 2 syllables instead of 3, so it is faster and easier to pronounce;
* there are much easier and better ways to abbreviate it, not requiring special symbols;
I would propose a better way to abbreviate it, in fact it could be used as the only to refer to it:
**cb** or **CB**
It is:
* extremely easy to type: just 2 letters that are very closely and conveniently placed on a standard QWERTY keyboard;
* extremely easy to pronounce, and there is no ambiguity about it: cee-bee;
* nothing it can be confused with, as far as I can think;
It doesn't get much shorter, simpler and easier than that.
PS: I don't have particularly strong feelings in favor of this "cb" proposal, but it is a good example. Other 2-letter abbreviations could work as well.

If a financial company accidentally gave investors more than it should have, the company owes an admission to the stakeholders as soon as the error has been discovered. Investors would take losses only for as long and to the extent that the error has its effects. When it is corrected, things can either go on as normal, or at worst bankruptcy proceedings resolve the situation. In practice it would be extremely difficult to screw up so bad as to lose a large percentage of the investors money due to a single undetected error.
They are normally expected to report regularly and publicly and an investor should definitely demand reporting of any such errors in some way. Plainly speaking, if the company fails to fulfill a promise to report such errors, this constitutes a breech of agreement or a lie or both.

I do believe that you are not greedy and are actually good for using the internet to find out a lot of valuable knowledge and opinions. In fact, you are also giving back. The internet is a great thing, isn't it? You never know how much of it you need.
Same with Bitcoin.
What you say about hoarding is right, *to an extent*.
If you hold too much for too long you will eventually be punished for your greed when a bear market comes and you are forced to sell low (like a *15-fold, or a 93% slump plus a deteriorated liquidity situation* did to some in 2011). If you hold too little for too little time, you will miss out, which could be caused by fear or ignorance or lack of strength or interest or access to information or many other things.
So you have to strike the right balance. Not everyone will. Who is to say where it is?
What you say about ideals is also is right. Money is used as a medium of exchange. But don't forget it is also used as a store of value. Think savings. The need for a savings mechanism is better served by an asset with higher market capitalization and liquidity.

* Section 3, the last two lines are rather confusing and really not even describing well which positions it is talking about and many positions are there for which.


It only says position 10, but then supposedly talks about 3 characters. If we assume that the whole first sentence is all about one clue, then wouldn't that have to be more like "10, 11 are the same as 8, 9", like the other 2-character clues? Or is the punctuation misleading in this case (it certainly is unreliable)?
Note that a valid WIF private key can well have less than 51 characters, although less commonly. I hope you checked the length of this private key.
* Section 4, position 4: I hope it is not assumed that all names displayed are names of doctors, because there is actually no indication of that, and so it would be wrong.
* Section 4, position 5: "Metro advertising screen company" - this can mean several different things. Is that the screen manufacturer or one of the several companies advertized on the screens? If it is the latter, you would have to specify several more things.
* Section 4, position 14: Why is this separate from 15 and WTF is up with the order of the two? Why should the first one be referring to a point after it? Are we supposed to repeat the same character for both positions or what?

OK, I take that back, you and are right that centralized pools could be set up to hide hashPrevBlock. It is fixable (some altcoins are probably already immune), but not without a hard fork. So a selfish mining pool (abbreviated "SMP" from now on) would have to hide the event of finding a private block from its members, which by the way precludes the possibility that a p2pool-type decentralized SMP scheme could be devised, doesn't it? In a decentralized SMP a miner who solves a block would need to somehow convince other pool members to start mining on the new work (in midstate format) that is provided by that miner, and I don't see how this can be done without revealing at least the proof of work for the newly solved private block. Otherwise any member would be able to provide bogus work and make the pool waste resources. Therefore a selfish miner would have to trust a pool operator in a centralized pool or hope to get sufficient hashing power to do solo selfish-mining.
There are various reasons why every miner should want not only to know what block he/she/it is mining on but actually have the power to choose everything that he/she/it wants to include in the whole structure of the block. In the case of a SMP, which apparently has to hide all the crucial data, participating miners would be put in an even worse situation. For all they would know, they could be hashing almost anything, mining on a past, present or not yet released block, or even attempting some sort of a preimage attack on anything.
If the stated intention of the SMP operator is to disrespect and deny some miners' (the ones outside the pool) work in order to take some of their revenue away, how are the SMP members supposed to trust him/her that he/she is not going to do the same thing to them? They actually can't.
The pool operator would have the opportunity to hide the total hashing power under his/her control. He/she could rationalize using different addresses for the generation transaction and IP addresses for each solved block. He/she could claim that not all blocks that appear to be published by a selfish miner come from his/her pool. The pool operator would probably want to hide absolutely everything that could be hidden and take control over everything that can be controlled.
What are then the members supposed to expect as revenue above what other pools offer (or any revenue, really)? The pool operator could claim he/she only has e.g. 34% and pay accordingly, when he/she actually has 49%. No honor among thieves.
With the exclusive knowledge of the current lead on the public chain and control over which transactions get included in the private chain the pool operator could also reverse transactions. A member of a SMP could unknowingly solve a block that reverses an earlier payment to that same member and to other members of the SMP. Hence the fitting expression "useful idiot".


What I meant was that if a selfish mining attack starts, ideally with over 33% of hashrate and at the beginning of a new 2016 block cycle, during this first cycle the blockchain is effectively slowed down dramatically for everybody. This has the effect of pushing even the SMP's revenue (per unit of time, not per block, obviously) lower than it would have been if mining normally. This affects the revenue from the generation reward, and has a more complex effect on the fees. Assuming most revenue comes from generation, a SMP and its members would have to be prepared and motivated to bear this short term opportunity cost somehow.

It actually is. I too made that wrong assumption once in a similar discussion, [but I was corrected]( They could make a protocol where they hide the first 64 bytes of the header and the way the [current Bitcoin block header structure is]( that would include the hashPrevBlock. A limitation on this would be that the extra nonce, which changes hashMerkleRoot, would have to be iterated by the pool operator and with high enough hashrate it may become a strain on bandwidth.
It would be nice if it is possible to make it so that such a protocol is impossible, thus forcing each miner to build each header they work on themselves. Maybe it is possible in a way that has no side effects and unintended consequences, by simply changing the order of the fields in the block header, but it does require a hard fork and everything that comes with that.

I think the reason is that in the fields of cryptography, free software and generally any type of free cooperative effort, once something good for a particular purpose has been proposed and accepted you need to propose something that is unquestionably and substantially better at it in order for it to be accepted. Anything less will not do.
Simply concatenating the passphrases and *then* applying WarpWallet would be much better, but even simply SHA-256 with multiple rounds would be better.
In your example, I can think of at least one case when your scheme is strictly less secure than even only 2 rounds of the hash function. Suppose that "Super Secret Passphrase" gets leaked somehow, but not the "FreeBSD" part. Now the attacker can compute the first hash and has to **bruteforce only the second iteration** of the hash function. This would reduce the time required roughly in half, back to what it is with the classic brainwallets. If all the secret material was instead hashed from the beginning you wouldn't have this problem.
You see now - it is very easy to make a small mistake when you try to be smart and not simply first try to learn and use the experience of others.
Even if it wasn't for this flaw, proposing something that is only cosmetically different than something known may make you look like someone who wants to earn undue credit to himself, even if that wasn't your intention.

I think is talking about the hash of the *previous* block header ([hashPrevBlock, see here]( which each miner will inevitably be able to see.
So, if this hash is the same as that of the latest public block this means the pool is not ahead, therefore better mine in another pool. If the hash is different this means the pool is currently deviated from protocol so (provided that the miner trusts that the pool operator is following the selfish mining strategy) better keep mining there for now.

You can use [Peter Todd's Timelock]( It involves placing a bounty and you have to make sure that bounty hunters will be sufficiently incentivized to eventually complete their computational work. If the bitcoin exchange rate goes down too much unlocking it might become unprofitable and pause unless/until the exchange rate goes up again. You can solve that issue by simply sending more bitcoins to the bounty addresses though. Another consideration: the accuracy of the time interval you set depends on the limited growth of scalar processing technology. You can only be sure about the maximum amount of time it would take.
You could use this to lock a bitcoin wallet file or private key. You would have to make sure that you don't save the secret unlocking it and the wallet/private key itself, but only the locked (encrypted) file. You publish the Timelock definition and watch the blockchain as bounty hunters make their way towards finding the secret which you can then use to unlock the file.

Dear [The website states](


Which was not done, even though the first bounty address was swept shortly after the second quiz was posted and around the time a correction for it was made on the website. You say something about only updating the website on weekends, but the address was swept on Sunday.
Without us seeing a solution to the first quiz that corresponds to its bounty address there is little to assure us that there is no *foul play* (let alone errors) either on your part or on the part of some of the authors of the quiz sections.
You say that there are different people creating each section of the quiz? I suppose one reason for this would be to make it harder for one of the authors to secretly claim the prize for themselves. And who provides the prize money anyway? There are *many* different things that may have gone very wrong with the whole arrangement.
Put yourself in our shoes. For all we know, the announced quizzes may not even solve to what are claimed to be the prize addresses. It wouldn't be the first time something like that happened here on I don't know for sure that something like that is actually the case, but if I have to look at what I do know - all the possible solutions that I tested - I have to conclude for now that this is the most likely explanation.
The first quiz address was supposedly swept by who is also [not publishing the solution]( I can't help but suspect that this whole thing might be a troll campaign (as has happened before) or potentially one (or several) of the quiz authors submitting misleading clues and then later secretly taking the prize, knowing that no one else would stand a chance to do so.
I wouldn't want to act ungratefully, but the fact of the matter is that so far we have no strong indication at all that any prize money was ever even claimable by anyone outside of your circle (or whoever generated the keys).

That is true, but the fact of the matter is that the way some of those bitcoins were used they are traceable. Some of those owners who didn't use a mixing service and keep the private key with which they deposited bitcoins at SR will be asking for their bitcoins back. They are the rightful owners and they can prove it. 
We can wish it were different (and we can work towards fungible cryptocurrencies in the future - this is a different topic), but it is what it is.

It says that the press office of the prosecutor general's office had stated that money substitutes, among which bitcoin, are banned in Russia.
And, to paraphrase the one quote in the article (and I haven't seen the original source), the motivation is, would you believe it, to protect citizens and organizations from having their rights violated when holding such currencies, since it entails a high risk of loss of value, caused by lack of anything securing real value (sic).

This is the other way you get to the Moon and other distant places: you incentivize it. When you buy gold you send a market signal that effectively directs resources towards exploration. Whether it is exploring the oceans looking for new lands, exploring the hinterland, or exploring space, the same principle has worked for thousands of years and will continue to work for some time.


If you think it would take 2-3 decades before the effects of asteroid mined gold hit the market (note that gold, as it is, is different from all other commodities in that changes in mining supply have little effect on the market, because gold mined each year is only a small fraction of all gold already mined) then is there anything you are trying to suggest about the gold market for the period until then? Are you suggesting that gold prices will be affected by this future development significantly and in such a long anticipation? Most importantly, when do you think gold will stop being the most *liquid* and, yes, *low-volatility* scarce asset among all scarce assets known?

I don't know about that 90 day rule. Simply waiting without claiming one's property certainly doesn't help in getting it back. There were stories in the press about people contacting those agencies to claim their bitcoins. The claims didn't look unreasonable - I cannot make a judgement on it but I can see that it is unsettled matter. It looks to me like none of them got anything back. 
If it turns out that some of those people asserted their claims the whole time and the agencies or courts were wrong then maybe this can be contested even in the traditional legal system (I'm not an expert on that, so I didn't claim that this can be done for sure). More importantly, it may be contested in alternative legal and enforcement systems (e.g. blacklisting, redlisting and various badly and not so badly thought out systems). You don't even need a complex system for this. There are many people who on the individual level have moral values which strictly deter them from accepting something that they consider stolen or would return it to whoever they consider the rightful owner if they came across it. In cases as famous as that of the SR bitcoins social pressures become significant.
See for example the cases of stolen famous works of art. They become practically unsellable, unusable (you can't hang it in your guest room, can you?) and more of a liability than an asset. I think something like this will play at least some role here.
There are so many things that make the whole business at best messy and certainly not for everyone. It also means that, in practice, the coins will not be fungible with other bitcoins. Their going price on the market will be lower than that of other bitcoins to the extent that people care about those coins' situation, and I know some people do (me included). You may or may not choose to be in that group. One reason I write all this is so that people here are not surprised later on when it becomes clear that the fungibility has limitations.


Do you mean that the fences here would be the bidders? That's how I see it. I think their job would be though, considering all the things that make traceability possible.
As for what a government has declared, those who support and count on that are still morally responsible for their actions.
I would just advise anyone thinking of bidding to beware of these things.

Yes, you are doing the right thing, but from what you said it is not clear whether you are doing it for the right reasons or not.
You see, the value of the dollar depends on the faith people just like you put in it. Every time you use a dollar and every second you hold a dollar you put faith in it and you give a part of yourself supporting it. This is even clearer if you work for dollars - when you ask or accept being paid in dollars. In effect you are partly responsible for defining the value of a dollar (although with fiat currencies in particular there are also always a different kind of forces that are outside of your control that can bring the value down arbitrarily).
The same holds even stronger for bitcoins. So if you focus too much on using dollars and too little on using bitcoins, it is not clear that your backup plan could ever even work. There is no use for a backup if you can't actually rely on it, right? So if you want to be more confident that it will actually work, you need to make it more than just a "backup plan". You would want to make it *at least* a "side project" or whatever you would call it. You would want to be more involved in it.
Edit: I also wanted to add that: you have to choose which one you feel more comfortable supporting, which one you feel has the better chance of working out well in the long run, and which one you think your support will have a better chance of actually realizing a positive effect for.
Edit2: If you find that the forces of human interaction are aligned so that a currency can survive every possible scenario, then you will probably be OK even without actively participating (or only holding, as in a "backup plan").
On the other hand, if, regardless of the amount of real world support a currency gets, its proper functioning can be disrupted and its value can be brought down by the actions of a small minority, then can you ever be sure that it is worth supporting it?

You have Electrum seeds (12 words from a 1626-word dictionary of common English words). It also accepts hex seeds of 32 hex digits (that is 128 bits. I think they said that soon an arbitrary length seed would be supported, so that you could use full 160 bits if you want). You could devise a scheme for an Electrum wallet based on an arbitrary passphrase, thus basically becoming like traditional brainwallets. For example you could use the WarpWallet key derivation scheme and input the first half of the output hash (32 hex digits) as a hex seed for Electrum.

You've just convinced me and a bunch of bitcoiners who think like me that there is a significant amount of bitcoins out there waiting to be panic sold by people who think like you when various authorities decide on a whim as much as to simply imply that Bitcoin could be banned or something like that. Doesn't even have to be an authority making a decision, it could be decided by any random adviser, speechwriter or crony of some such authority, or it could even be a random error, miscommunication or misinterpretation. Not to mention mere bluffing. Do I even have to mention all the countless ways things could play out?
The point is, there is money to be made and people like you are willingly putting yourselves in a position to potentially be on the losing side and people like you are also willingly putting various authorities (or people around them) in a position which they can exploit for their own personal benefit. And then there is a third group of people, those like me, who merely have to take into account those other two groups of people. What that means for me is that it is probably a good idea to keep some more dry powder for when such a bitcoin panic sale occurs so that I too can profit from it somewhat, or at least be hedged.
What's left to say is that if/when our paths separate and you are no longer in the Bitcoin community because of your belief in authorities, rest assured that we will live just fine without you (although not as fine as we would if you were not to hold those beliefs).

All the gold contained in the world's oceans is [estimated to be about 15 000 metric tons]( which would be in the order of ***one tenth*** of all the gold already mined and still in someone's possession. That would also be comparable to five years of production at today's rate (less than 3000 metric tons per year). Yes, I didn't mix those numbers up. Think about it. Gold is a currency that grows less than 2% in quantity, annually. This means that gold's value is orders of magnitude less susceptible to any production shocks compared to any other physical commodity.
You all grossly underestimate the significance of the huge market capitalization and market depth of gold.
No offense, but I would strongly recommend you learn some basic facts about the things you would want to talk about before you talk about them.

Thank you. I gave a short explanation in [this post](
So the most significant statement was indeed the 5-word limit. You shouldn't have said it. The next most important piece of information you gave away was in [this post]( explaining about how inserting words or very short random strings would be ok. It looked to me like you felt like you owed this detailed explanation. From these two pieces of information I thought that, if your rule inserts a string and the rule is at most 5 words long, the string will very likely be the same every time. You wouldn't be able to cram a description for something that is a function of something else, except maybe something very simple, such as the number of something in each word (I did try that kind of stuff by iterating all numbers from 0 to the length of a word and inserting it after the word. That would cover rules such as "[insert the] number of consonants after [each] word" or "[insert the] number of syllables after [each] word"). Then I was mostly trying different descriptions (what you called "patterns") of where to put that short string.
An abbreviated list of things I tried (I had to keep notes of what I had already tried):
* C = character occurring in the original phrase.
* X = the 95 printable characters in ASCII (what you can type on a regular US/UK qwerty layout keyboard), including space.
* XYZ - all combinations of 1 to 3 characters.
* W = words from a wordlist containing XYZ and short English words and names and a few added keywords.
* add X/XX/XXX/XXXX before/around/after/replacing every C (repeating character X)
* replace every C with CC-CCCCCCCCC (repeat C's N times)
* add XY before/around/after every vowel/consonant
* replace every vowel/consonant with XYZ
* add XY before/after every word
* replace every C with XYZ
* add W between syllables (including 17 *wrong* syllabifications!)
* add X before/after every syllable (correct syllabification only)
* add X in the middle of words (replacing middle letter, if any)
* add XYZ after each "the"
* swap C1 and C2
* the bruteforcing of digits after words, explained above
* add X before/after letters, once per word, trying all positions in a word
* add W before/around/after/replacing Nth letters of words
* add W before/after/repacing "ocean" and "sea"
* add W after/replacing "the"
* add W before/around/after every C
...and a few other things.

Phones use flash memory (whether SD cards or internal storage), which does not always physically erase the the data, even after "factory reset". It may well be recoverable.
You say you had a backup on internal storage. Is there any chance the original wallet file was kept on external storage (SD card)? Recovering data from a SD card is somewhat simpler. It might or might not be worth the effort at the current exchange rate, but it may well become worth a try in the future. If you want to keep your chances of successful recovery you should stop using the storage device ASAP (in case of internal memory you would have to stop using the phone and turn it off). That's what I would recommend you do right now. Then you could look at data recovery - there are software methods that you might be able to try yourself (e.g. TestDisk) and hardware methods that may involve taking things apart and are offered as services.

Legal tender laws in many (most?) countries don't actually prohibit other currencies being used as payment for all those things. Some people already use decentralized currencies for those things, and it is only going to spread.
In the meantime one can use some holdings of such currencies as high quality collateral in order to obtain fiat-denominated loans at low, *fixed* rates. QE has little negative effects for a person doing this, and might in fact be financially beneficial for them, at the expense of people who hold fiat-denominated assets. This apparent injustice is just the effect of the "trusted" third party's actions (the central bank doing the QE).
One can indeed fall victim of legal tender laws in many situations, for example in situations similar to what might happen with MtGox's customers - MtGox still has some bitcoins which they could directly repay, but might instead "liquidate" them and repay in fiat.
However, if one tries to minimize reliance and dependence on state-controlled legal and financial systems, one will at the same time reduce the central bank's influence over them, which is my point. I would argue that those characteristic state features have even greater negative effects over both society as a whole and the individual than QE has, which is undoubtedly bad enough.

Right. When you transact you pay only transaction fees, when you hold you pay implicitly for the monetary inflation. The latter is measured best as an annualized rate: [see the red line here](
It is, of course, proportional to the amount held and not connected to the number of transactions.
The rate is currently at about 11-12%. This is lower than with the USD (I hope you won't confuse *price* inflation for *monetary* inflation), but currently higher than with gold (gold productions is at lower single digits).

Mixing services are useful when part of a overall scheme for total confidentiality or anonymity. If you are wiring a deposit to enter the auction, sending bids via e-mail and probably doing a lot of paperwork and registering with countless government agencies and private financial and legal institutions before completing the transaction, then you don't have much confidentiality to speak of. Whoever bids at that auction will attract a lot of attention.
Also, I don't know how effective mixing services are. One mixing scheme was recently proven to be flawed.

You are right that the holding period is crucial, however there is a little more to it than what is in your interpretations of these examples (if I understand you correctly).
Even when holding fiat, exchanging to bitcoin for a purchase and then instantly converting to fiat has a small net positive effect for the exchange rate of bitcoin, due to the small period of time when BTC was held. If there is a large volume of such transactions, even this small effect can become significant.
As for people getting their salaries in fiat currency, they obviously are a big net supporter of the value of fiat currency, because they are so many and the values so large (although if you consider bank credit and other things, it becomes more complicated than that). This is compared to not getting a salary or getting a salary in another currency or form. Therefore it wouldn't be proper to say that if you convert your fiat salary to BTC you are contributing to a lower value for the fiat currency; it would be correct to say that you are minimizing your net contribution to a higher value for the fiat currency, given a fiat paying job.

Actually, it is just the opposite, and there is a good reason for it. The fact that we are not capable of breaking the speed of light makes every sentient being valuable as someone who is in the best position to make decisions as to how to interact with the nearest surrounding environment. In simple terms, when an event occurs somewhere, no one can observe and understand it quicker and react better than the person who is closest to it (and watching for it). Take for example a market moving event. The first person or entity who can observe it and trade it will get the greatest reward. The last one better not even try to trade it, as it will have already been priced in.
The bankers who created:
* Central banking;
* Central clearing;
* Central exchanges and markets;
* Central statistics;
* Central planning and communism;
* etc.
have one eternal enemy - time. The fact that they can't send and receive information instantly means that everything they learn and order takes an amount of time (the speed of light giving a theoretical minimum) to propagate. When an event occurs somewhere away from the central entity anyone who is closer to that event can react first and get a better outcome at whatever it is. If someone has an idea as to how the central entity would react, that's even better because it creates an arbitrage opportunity, which means that that someone will be able to gain at the expense of a central entity. Such a central entity would love it if people were deluded into believing that it is basically omnipresent and omniscient and thus were deterred to act in their own self interest. Arbitrageurs, on the other hand, love it when a central entity deludes *itself* that it is omnipresent or omniscient and acts as if it was. Equilibrium is when everyone understands which decisions and actions they are actually in the best position of making and acts so. This is decentralization.
Whether we are talking about a market or any other form of interaction the same basic principles apply.

Come on, it is called fucking ***Social Security*** Number. And the alternatives you propose are Drivers License Num/Passport Number? Or are you going to say that you believe that the US government cares about people having their money? If anything, the fact that ***you*** and ***almost everyone else*** doesn't have (and needs to be prevented from having) such databases should be troubling for us, for many reasons, but that's another matter.
**I don't think that any of the dystopian authors ever even envisioned that someone could say that a number given by a fucking government is "secret" and "random" (having entropy). You can't make this shit up.**
However, if you are convinced that you can keep the connection between your brainwallet address and your identity a secret, and are willing to accept the risk of losing the money if you fail, then that would be OK. Good luck. You should also consider hiding the mere fact that you ever touched bitcoins or thought of doing so, because the people in those categories aren't that many and can also be targeted together, bringing the entropy coming out of this number down dramatically.
In other words this should be considered to only help in broad attacks that are not specifically targeted at one individual. This somewhat makes up for the undesirable characteristic that all addresses that have money are publicly available in the blockchain.
See [WarpWallet]( for an implementation of this.
@_date: 2014-03-05 20:31:06
I only need to have an idea about what your scheme could be and I can write a custom script for it. If you compare a custom attack to an attack that attacks all addresses in the blockchain (targeting regular SHA-256 brainwallets), you'll have a reduction of efficiency of {sum of all ballances in brainwallets}/{your ballance} times.
If I know that this is the precise scheme you've used (in this example I notice that you've used SHA-256 so I have everything I need) the problem only becomes very slightly computationally harder. Concatenation of strings is cheap. In effect, this about as strong as one round of SHA-256 at the cost of two. Better simply do two rounds of SHA-256, which is called [key stretching]( All in all, your scheme is {sum of all ballances in SHA-256 brainwallets}/{sum of all ballances in your type of brainwallet} times as unattractive for attackers as regular SHA-256 brainwallets.
TL;DR: if someone knows that you've used this exact scheme (or has a good idea what the scheme is) and that you have a non-negligible amount of bitcoins, it will be cracked, fast.
Edit: I was wrong, this is actually about as secure as **ONE** round of SHA-256 *at the cost of two*.

May I add my comment and in a blockchain-like manner give my recognition and support for the opinions expressed in the 5 comments above mine.
Bitcoin has more in common with precious metals than with paper money (or their current electronic equivalents). Actually, it takes the best of both worlds.
As for Bitcoin 2.0, the community will demand a smooth transition and I think it would be technically easy to do. You could start an alt chain *on top of* the current Bitcoin blockchain, at a given block height. The owners of the Bitcoin 1.0 private keys would be able to sign transactions that go into the new chain. In effect everyone who holds a balance of X BTC will then hold a balance of X BTC (v1.0 bitcoins) *and* X BTC2 (v2.0 bitcoins). A decentralized exchange between the two can also be incorporated in the design of Bitcoin 2.0 or separately. Such a transition could be passively safe (i.e. even if you do nothing you are not left with no stake in the new thing).

I totally understand you there. In schools they teach just a few particular standard *methods* for representing concepts that could otherwise be understood very intuitively and easily.

Other people have it the other way around. People think in different ways and that's OK.
One can hate using a method, a representation, a language or a theory but it makes no sense to hate something that exists in the real world such as an underlying law of nature, a phenomenon, a technology or an implementation of a technology (for its mere existence), etc.

Now when I think of it, this is actually ***much worse*** than I initially thought. If one were to bruteforce this whole thing one would need to calculate the first hash only once for all possible values of the shorter phrase. Even if they are a small number, in practice the speed would be only slightly slower than with a single round of the hash function.
I can tell you that right now I am getting the feeling that you are trying to deliberately fool or troll people, even though in reality you are probably just a stubborn fool (no offense, I already told you why).

That would not be a reliable way to erase data on flash memory. Flash-based storage devices can and do physically have more memory than is logically accessible. With SSDs you have [over-provisioning]( and there are similar things going on at a lower level within NAND flash chips. For example, a USB flash drive or a SD card that has one flash chip can show 4GB, but it could well contain 8GB or 16GB of memory inside, which may be of a high error rate and was thus designated as a 4GB product. It still has extra blocks inside which a microcontroller uses to write data to in ways that the user could have no clue about. Even without extra blocks, if a block goes bad the microcontroller would make it inaccessible, but there is no reason to assume that the data within it was physically erased. Practically there will very likely be old data somewhere on the flash memory which the user doesn't have any access to, but which would be recoverable.

While I was ultimately unable to disprove categorically the possibility that selfish mining pools can form or survive for long (being suitable only for idiots does not at all qualify as a disproof, considering that there *are* idiots in the world) there are many more things that need to be considered that make the dynamics very complex. By the way, hoping to be given more money for the use of the same mining hardware, by a person that has next to no incentive to pay such money, in exchange for completely giving up all control over what it is being used for, can't be much of a *goal* among such people. The real goal would be a 51% attack and full centralized control of the blockchain and all mining revenue in one's hand. Whoever (if anyone) is willing to be a SMP *member* would much prefer to be a SMP *operator* or solo selfish miner. This means that if one selfish mining attempt appears there would almost certainly be fierce competition. This creates some complex dynamics reminiscent of power struggles in governments and other criminal organizations. I don't know how exactly they play out, but I am willing to bet that they cannot ultimately kill Bitcoin.
So in my previous post I was only able to prove that selfish mining pool members cannot be *guaranteed* to receive more revenue, or any revenue at all, but I see that this is not enough. One might even be tempted to make a comparison to honest businesses in a free market, which aren't guaranteed anything either, but still become successful. Such a comparison would of course miss the crucial difference that a business' success depends on making good decisions during operation, whereas a miner agreeing to participate in a selfish mining pool would be making a *pure gamble* on the *bad* faith of a single individual, having no ability to make any decision whatsoever afterwards (except stop participating). I just hope that miners consider all this.

Well, I totally share [feeling about the video]( However, these days I no longer think implementing ideas such as eliminating fiat currency cash forms are necessarily bad things to happen (by dropping its legal tender status or ceasing its production or ceasing its acceptance by governments or central banks, i.e. not by aggressive methods, which wouldn't be needed in any case). Sure, it is crazy and most people would be outraged, but this is the government, after all (central banks are formally separate from the government but they have been practically part of the same whole since their creation). I don't mind those of its dumb ideas that do not directly violate anyone's rights. I would be just fine if cash was eliminated tomorrow. It so happens that I might even be better off for it.
That said, I would not express any opinion on what is a *good* idea for state policy, on any issue whatsoever.
But I would say with a straight face that in principle it is a good thing that the idea of eliminating fiat currency cash is out there.

Alright, you got me there :D
So yeah, no doubt sometimes guilt is hard to prove. Good reputation is lost regardless, though. It might be possible for a business to prove innocence, though. If a business can actually prove good practices, that's a huge competitive advantage in an environment not regulated by force (a state). Therefore entrepreneurs would have an incentive to go out of their way to find ways to be as transparent as possible. Bitcoin has a thing or two to offer in this respect and it's a shame (and at the same a great opportunity) that exchanges have not been implementing these until recently.
Thanks for the tip about particular ways in which state regulations achieve opacity and attract fraudsters, but I already know enough to avoid those companies as the plague. I also notice the apparent subsidence of high profile bankruptcies and I can only say that the silence is deafening.
So many corporations and governments pool so much risks and promises so tightly together that you can't look at them separately but you can look at this whole agglomeration as one entity. When you look at a global level, at the end of the day, this one entity is affected by all the same basic economic forces that apply on a smaller scale. This entity is mostly opaque, and where it is transparent, it looks awfully like a Ponzi scheme (e.g. promising to pay by taking from newcomers). Now if someone wants to participate in an *overt* Ponzi scheme that is entirely on their conscience. Same with pushing money in a black box and hoping for the best. This is not investing or saving, not even a "business" or a "service" at all.
Therefore if you go back to my previous post you will see that the remark about not being prone to epic failure does not apply to this entity with all of its components.

Here's my attempt at improving and correcting some things. The most important thing that should be pointed out is to first make it clear what is a balance of bitcoins, such as what you have in a transaction output, which should be separated from what the [numéraire]( is, i.e. what one bitcoin is (the currency unit BTC):
**Simple definition:**
* A ***bitcoin balance*** is a pairing of a locked unit in a ledger (the *so-called blockchain*) and the credentials required to transfer it (a private key or keys, which enable a user or users to transfer it);
* One bitcoin (abbreviated 'BTC') is a bitcoin balance (or combination of balances) with an amount of 1.0 recorded in the ledger;[I don't know if you would find this this whole second bullet useful or necessary]
* Upon registration of a transfer in the blockchain, the credentials used by the transferor or transferors become ineffective, and the transferee or transferees’ credentials are replaced as the controlling credentials of the unit.
**More technical definition:**
* A bitcoin balance is the pairing of a locked unit in the ledger (as recorded on the blockchain), and the wallet address (a unique public identifier) and a corresponding private key or keys which can be used to produce a *digital* signature proving control over [or a new kind of *property title* - that's an interesting legal question] the specified wallet address with its corresponding unit or units in the ledger;
* If the putative owner of the bitcoin balance, who holds the correct credentials, transfers the bitcoin balance the destination wallet address or addresses, the quantum or quanta of the transfer as well as a signature are *broadcast*[or is 'broadcasted' the correct word in legalese?] in the Bitcoin network. This signature *may later serve as* a “proof of ownership” (the OP_CHECKSIG code, which is used in standard Bitcoin transactions) of the unit in the ledger (a hash that is a function of the public key, private key and specific unit in the public ledger [this part is not very clear or precise, and it would probably be hard to make it precise without going into more details, while it may not be necessary for the specific audience]).
* This is verified by the Bitcoin *protocol*;
* Upon successful transfer (being written *and sufficiently confirmed* into the blockchain by the miners), the signature that was used by the transferor becomes ineffective, and the transferee’s credentials become the required credentials for a future transfer of the same unit.

It took centuries for the old English monarchs to betray and defraud their subjects by changing the legal definition of "pound sterling" from *one pound* of *sterling silver* (92.5% fine silver) to a different weight of sterling silver and then several more centuries to get to today's meaning which no longer has anything to do with weight or silver (at least it is still a unit of value and it is therefore still possible to exchange a "British pound" for some amount of silver in the free market). I'll say it again, this way: it wasn't about "purely theoretical confusion", it was about outright, real life, livelihood-affecting, societal-trust-breaking, massive and widespread fraud.
If it took less than 6 years for bitcoin to first acquire market value and then have people try to change its name directly to something that means something that has no value at all, being a completely unrelated concept (a unit of information; separately, as the word for a small quantity of something)... then that would be something that would put even the most dishonest, psychopathic or sociopathic person of power, real or one only existing in dystopian novels, to shame.

Thank you for posting this.
After I too had solved almost everything, bruteforced the rest *and* bruteforced it again with code to try to correct up to 1 error anywhere in the private key, didn't find anything and then exactly the same thing happened for quiz  it occurred to me that one explanation could be that we are mere collateral casualties of one of the 4 section authors trying to cheat the quiz organizer out of the prize money. If one of them wanted to do something like that, he or she could include several deliberately misleading or unsolvable clues, just enough to make bruteforcing it unfeasible. Then, assuming that none of the other three is independently exploiting the same weakness, he or she could solve the other three parts and sweep the prize wallet, comfortable that no one else (excluding the organizer) would realistically have a chance to do so first without the "answers" to the misleading clues. This could be done without revealing that he or she is one of the authors.
However, the answers to the first quiz don't support the theory that this weakness might have been exploited (although I cannot exclude the possibility of effective collusion between the authors of more than one of the sections 2, 3 or 4). There are only 2 characters that are inconsistent with my answers, and they are in two separate sections. It was feasible for me to try to correct up to two "errors" in my answers, which would have found this private key, but I didn't try it.
One difference with my answers is in section 4, position 6. I had a capital "S", which is the way it appears in the credit titles (["THUS **SP**OKE ZARATHUSTRA"]( and really anywhere you write a *title* in the English speaking world (sometimes even if you write the German version of the title in an English text). It is only in the German version and when written the way titles are capitalized in German that a lowercase "s" appears ("Also **sp**rach Zarathustra"), which is, of course, something that only comes to my attention now.
The other difference was in section 3, position 6 ("My 6, 2nd King of bad miss worded rymes."), where I had confidently answered "H" (which is again the same as what and were trying). I will not comment on that.

You just have to set the control over the coins right at the time the contract is entered into, rather than at the time the contractual right has to be exercised. Rather than thinking about it when you get divorced, you have to take care of it when you get married. Makes sense, doesn't it?

Because they are good at the business they are in - simple honest mining - and want to do more of that.


Trying to approach monopoly is an entirely different business. Also, it is not all money growing on trees forever and no down sides. Any monopolist, even an unintentional one, but certainly one that intends to exploit the monopoly position (whether for profit or for control), loses some very important and irreplaceable things. They inevitably lose the signalling mechanism that are prices in a competitive free market. They no longer have a real and objective way to determine whether they should increase or decrease operations and how much, whether they should change anything, whether they should be interested in any innovation, etc. They get into the position of totally losing their place in the world and not being able to understand what other people want or don't want from them. This is valid on any level and scale - whether we are talking about an entirely planned economy, a monopoly on a product, currency, land, anything. There is *plenty* of history and economics you can read where you can learn that when you mess with the natural workings of mechanisms such as markets and pricing you screw yourself in ways that are apparently unforeseen, but so immense and incredibly destructive.
With Bitcoin mining those price signals would be the bitcoin exchange rate, and increasingly in the future - the transaction fee (in BTC per byte, or total fees in BTC per block) for which naturally a market will emerge. If a monopoly emerged they wouldn't know how to properly interpret e.g. a fall in mining revenue (either the BTC exchange rate or transaction demand going down). Is it normal fluctuation which might prompt them to hike transaction fees (justified as necessary in order to maintain the mining hardware, to be able to defend against a mining competitor), or is it people going out of Bitcoin and into a forked or entirely different chain, in which case hiking transaction fees would only make it worse? A monopolist is not in a good position to be able to make good decisions on such matters. If they wanted to be able to make somewhat good decisions it would cost extra time and money (bureaucracy, which only gets worse with time) which a competitive free market wouldn't be burdened with. So, you see - this is an example of the destructive positive feedback loops that exist in the operation of a monopoly.
Also, starting a competitor business becomes more and more attractive with time, as the monopoly degenerates from more and more inefficiencies and mistakes, until the up front costs become justifiable and affordable. Eventually monopolies end, unless directly enforced by a state's coercion and aggression (I think Bitcoin is very good at working around these), in which case they may get to last somewhat longer. If you get your hands dirty with forces of coercion and aggression, as I said earlier, this is an entirely different business. I would even say a doomed business.
Furthermore, a monopoly on Bitcoin mining, whether the Bitcoin protocol remained the same or not, would be much shorter lived compared to monopolies on other things because Bitcoin mining is an industry that is so dynamic and susceptible to advancements, and I can go in more details if you want me to.
Many people understand at least the basics of all this and are not attracted by monopoly status at all. There will probably be an intersection of people who know the industry and control freaks, but those will not be all the people in the industry. With Bitcoin mining, my guess is that they are only a minority, and my bet is that their share and influence would be greatly diminishing with time (the learning which I talked about - whether purposeful learning, learning through mistakes, or becoming impotent to repeat the same mistakes, is what forms a *negative feedback loop*).


I would have no indication of that. You might well be deep in debt at this particular moment if you borrowed money to get there. Even with no debt, if you had just bought all this hardware then it hasn't paid off yet. If it all ended now you would be able to recover only a fraction of your investment from recycling all the now useless hardware you have.


If I were in that situation I would give up, confess publicly, write a book about it and make a killing on book sales ;) Are you suggesting that even if you end up worse off than if you just mined normally, you would still spend whatever resources you have left to try the same thing again? You would double your bet out of diminishing resources while going after only a fixed "prize" (however high its perceived value might be). That's even worse than [gambler's ruin](
This doesn't make any sense whatsoever. Nothing of what you can do can lead you to achieving monopoly if other people don't play along - and that is especially valid for a cryptocurrency. An interesting corollary is that if you are a monopolist you are being used by other people who pursue their own ends and probably don't otherwise care about you or what you do. This should be simple to understand - at the end of the day you cannot force people to value your centralized currency and/or force them not to value another currency that is decentralized *at a given moment in time*.


This is a race that only exists and matters for those who believe in it. I certainly don't.
If you believe you are "winning" a monopoly "race" then you don't understand what is happening around you.






Not in the long run. You have to have patience. It may only look as if it works, but it is simply not sustainable, ever, at all.
Look - there are always alternatives and an alternative is all it takes to beat a monopolist. At the end of the day, if I see a centralization mania in all cryptocurrencies so strong that they can't be practically used as desired, I could leave the cryptocurrencies for a while and go farther away and find an alternative in precious metals, for example. Good luck monopolizing that! It all works out well, eventually.

Apparently there is one place where they *want* internet money:
@_date: 2014-05-02 21:47:08
Good point. Just as today miners are investing considerable resources developing custom proof-of-work hardware, the same group of people has also an interest in developing a good alternative to conventional internet service providers. They have an incentive to keep a reliable (preferably one that don't depend on third parties) and low latency connections to each other. That's why I think they will eventually become a driver of development in the area, especially if lower block interval schemes become more important (altchains, potentially as side chains or tree chains, p2pool, etc.) since those would naturally be more sensitive to latency. And I'm obviously also talking about mesh networking all the way down to physical layer, not only on the network or transport layers.
Miners might also find themselves in need of good anonymity networks (that use regular internet connections) if some government decides to crack down on mining. Each miner would definitely want to have a way to get the highest priority and lowest latency possible and the best judge in such cases would be money.

It's been a while, but I felt I owe you something for your contribution towards cracking this.

No. It's just that it actually does reek of conformism. It's like when you look up "conformist" in a dictionary this sentence is in there. There is also nothing "confrontational" about the original one. That is all I'm saying.
By the way, I'm not even saying that dollars should be *refused*. But this shit crosses a line. It actually explicitly states "Dollars Accepted" and puts it in first place. If by "dollar" is actually meant "four hundred and sixteen grains of standard silver" that would definitely be non-conformist but also unexpected and puzzling for many. I somehow doubt it being the case (note the green background behind the dollar sign which hints at dollar *notes*). The definition of a dollar has changed over the years and the new forms have only tacitly been accepted by the majority, not without the influence of (and as is apparent from discussions here, rampant misunderstanding of) legal tender laws. Explicitly stating that you accept dollars is **very significant**, because this could be considered legally binding for the business and would go in the [exact opposite direction of what a private business would want]( Of course, then there is the propaganda preaching that anything that has anything to do with the state is somehow inherently good or desirable.
In short, the first sentence explicitly waives rights that the majority of the public only fails to assert because they don't see the *immediate* need to or out of ignorance or brainwashing. 
As for the second sentence, from a business/legal/marketing or any other perspective "preferred" means absolutely nothing. It means something for the person who wrote it, and you can say that his/her intentions are probably not to be a conformist, to the extent that preferring bitcoin is non-conformist, but the actual *effects* of the sign could be quite the opposite. Stating that paying in bitcoin is cheaper would be much much smarter.

You seem to be assuming that there is value in seeking to centralize it and being the monopolist. What if it doesn't actually pay off compared to simply staying one miner of many?
It is true that someone might decide to try it regardless of rational consideration. However, it doesn't look like you've considered the near zero cost of the community forking away from any centralized blockchain (a simple example would be switching to a different hash function at a certain block height) thus taking away any power (perceived or real) from whoever is trying to centralize, which would also moreover very likely ruin the centralizer financially. This might look dramatic and revolutionary, but I think it could happen in a very smooth and orderly process for the users (could be as simple as deciding to fork and then installing a software update). How long would it take until all power-hungry psychopaths out there learn that it simply doesn't work, or if they don't learn, get financially and morally so utterly ruined that they can't even attempt it again. My bet is that it would be the fastest social learning process ever.
@_date: 2014-07-25 21:52:36


What you are missing here is not something about Bitcoin, but something about the current monetary and financial system. If you live in the United States and are used to the dollar, you probably haven't felt much of the insidious and incredibly destructive effects fiat currencies have. This currency has been so popular around the world that it has enabled most people in America to see net material benefit because of it, although temporarily. It has masked the fact that fiat currencies are, and this is no exaggeration, immensely powerful at destroying exactly what you mentioned: *social cohesion and the sense of community*. This is what most peoples around the world have been experiencing, learning and suffering from with increasing intensity for many decades.


It is not so much about mere change of perception but about a change of very substantial and real economic effects one's actions have. When you use dollars (even just owning them) you support a system that has done and will continue to do things so abhorrent and inhumane you could hardly even imagine. When you have an open source cryptocurrency you can at least see all its mechanisms and understand the effects of its use and then make a better educated decision about using it.

Here I am talking about the possibility to not keep a private key unencrypted. I can guarantee you that rubber-hose cryptanalysis is never going to work with some individuals securing their own money. For some it is not just about not losing the money. It is a matter of principle. Some would rather die and have the coins destroyed forever than finance criminality.






My understanding is that the set of inherent *risks* is one of the criteria that set apart asset classes.
I mentioned this second point because of the risk of those extreme situations when a person could normally become completely deprived of all property. For example - a totalitarian state. Whether as a minority in a nazist or fascist state or as anyone in a communist state, or in many other situations, people lost absolutely everything that could conceivably be confiscated, the easiest to lose being what is stored in a central location. In the past, the only way around this was wide geographic diversification, which is far from optimal.
Another example - you get locked up in a cage and there is no one else you can count on to control your assets for you, or you have no other assets. You could even be in a situation of being a rich prisoner, which creates some interesting behavioral dynamic with the guards and inmates. Promises of hidden treasure have been known to save people from death row and buy them freedom. However brainwallets (with very strong passphrases, of course!) are much better than buried precious metals because you can easily add more to it, you can show a proof that you created it (e.g. embed a message in the blockchain such as "Mr. F. owns this brainwallet") and you shouldn't worry about treasure hunters with metal detectors.
This means that there are *risks* which if you want to properly protect yourself from you wouldn't be able to do so owning any other asset classes in existence today.
**Cryptocurrencies differ fundamentally from all other types of *property*, never mind *assets*.**






No offence, but this really is not well thought out. Maybe I shouldn't have used the word "supply" in the first place. More precisely I should have pointed at the growth rate in the quantity of the currency. First, quantity is measured in units that are fungible (interchangeable) with one another. Think of gold, for example. It is similarly divisible (down to atoms), but what is important is that a piece of gold having mass *m* is fungible with another piece of gold of the same mass *m*, right? That's why it makes sense to measure the quantity of gold in units of mass. Similarly with bitcoins, one BTC is considered the same as another BTC, therefore we can talk of quantity of bitcoins. Then the growth rate of the quantity is best measured in percent per year. You can see how it looks on a chart [here]( labelled as "Inflation rate" (source: 
The growth rate is crucial for long term planning, especially if you consider doing things such as having savings and hedging long term risks. Bitcoin might have something new to offer in this area and therefore its value will be affected by this. Milton Friedman was talking about a currency with a growth rate artificially and automatically fixed at e.g. 4% (no endorsement of his monetary ideas from me, I'm just taking note of this). Well, here for the first time ever you have the technology that can enable something like that.
Bitcoins are, in fact, limited in both quantity growth and in total quantity. You can compare that to e.g.: Picasso paintings (as assets) which were indeed limited in their total quantity once he died, but nothing could have been said of them *in certain and quantitative terms* before that (there are obviously many other differences in characteristics with bitcoins, so I wouldn't put them in the same category); gold, which is actually growing very slowly in quantity but is not strictly limited in growth or total quantity (if we consider that it would eventually be economically mined outside of this planet); fiat money (i.e. money by law), where the quantity is only constrained by the limits of dishonesty, fear and stupidity.
The limit in the total quantity (add to that the fact that each bitcoin is technically unique and distinguishable, even though they are in practice fungible) means that whatever part you own, you own a proportionate part of history, and no one else can change that. It is up to the subjective judgement of every person to decide how valuable is that for them.






No, here I distinguish between a mere upper limit and a target rate. A predetermined rate of growth adds the possibility to make even more accurate long term predictions and planning. Bitcoin quantity will follow the chart linked above within some relatively small margin of uncertainty. Compare that to e.g. gold, which is actually significantly constrained in the quantity growth it can experience for a number of reasons (I can get into details if you want) - maybe it could conceivably go from 1.6% growth to a surge of 5 or even 10%, but not much higher, and certainly not anywhere near what you can have with the other commodities, (this I think is actually one of the most important factors that make gold a relatively good form of money) but the rate of growth is still not nearly as predictable as in Bitcoin; dogecoin has a (somewhat less strictly) predetermined quantity growth, but the total quantity is not limited. I am pointing this out not to argue which one is better, but to point out that this is another distinct characteristic, which was unattainable by any asset before bitcoin, certainly not by decentralized ones (ones not issued by organizations or single individuals).
When you think carefully you will see that all those specifics about cryptocurrencies are very significant and indeed game changing. They are worthy enough to be considered when thinking about value and risk.


If we have to fit bitcoin in the same class as other currencies, it would have to be a greatly widened class that would also include all fiat currencies, private currencies, precious metals, a whole bunch of things some people like as a store of value (e.g. art, antiques and various other collectibles, wine, diamonds, etc.). In any case, you can never classify everything perfectly.

True, but this *monetary* inflation is actually paid mostly by the holders, and not as much by the ones who transact. The ones who transact have the option of converting to and from whatever currency they prefer and not hold bitcoins for long and thus the net effect of the monetary inflation on their funds can be diminished.
I can speak for the holders, because I am one. I am willing to hold bitcoins despite the monetary inflation (thus transferring wealth to miners) because this encourages the miners to develop the mining infrastructure some more and make it very resilient to attacks. This is exactly what I want to see. I think the whole Bitcoin ecosystem will benefit from this. 
Eventually this metric will fall again (it fluctuates wildly) and make it very attractive to transact in bitcoin even for Bitcoin-skeptics.

That's a good question, and I'm not sure about the answer. What I know is that some implementations inheriting from  and probably farther back before it accept it and generate a public key with a value of 0x00 (that's a single zero byte, not to be confused with an empty string when generating the address, which just prompted me to check another address for possible burned coins, and sure enough there seems to be a steady stream of coins going to whoever owns the private key corresponding to the the empty public key :D [1HT7xU2Ngenf7D4yocz2SAcnNLW7rK8d4E]( 
So yeah, strictly speaking no corresponding public key is being derived. Those are just some addresses that get generated from time to time from dummy or error values, buggy test code, etc.

I have no idea who the Two-Bit Idiot is, but by just reading quickly through the linked page I am able to **LOGICALLY CONCLUDE THAT HE IS DISHONEST**. That's right. I am going to use only logic and his own words.
* Case 1: He truly lives up to his name and is indeed an idiot. Nothing of what he says can be taken at face value.
* Case 2: He doesn't have the documents he claims he has. He is lying.
* Case 3: He does have the documents. Also, he has already written the expose (note his words regarding the expose: "*If I get hit by a bus this weekend, my lawyers will release it.*"). Note the top of his page where he describes himself as follows: "***Truth-teller.***" Since it's been a day since he posted this, and the documents and expose are still not published, he is simply **not telling the whole truth. He is withholding it**. Be it 72 hours or 24 hours or even 1 hour - it is already too much time withholding the truth. There can be no excuse for that. They don't say "the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth" for nothing. You can't pick and choose. But let's disregard this for a moment. Suppose that:
* Case 3A: He doesn't even intend to keep his ultimatum promise. His promises are empty. He is clearly dishonest.
* Case 3B: He intends to keep his promise when the ultimatum expires, regardless of the outcome. Now his future actions depend solely on outside factors - the decisions of others. He has no way of predicting those in advance with certainty. This means that he is ***willing and committed to suppress the information indefinitely*** in case the ultimatum conditions are met. This further aggravates his situation of temporarily withholding the truth and turns him into a committed truth suppressor. His commitment can be seen in these words: "***I hope to eat my article, keep the documents that I have to myself [...], and redirect the focus of the Bitcoin community from scandal and frustration...***" In other words he is a hypocrite and there are cases where he is absolutely and definitely not a truth teller. He is dishonest.
At least one of these cases is true and I don't know which one, but at this point it doesn't really make much of a difference. I am going to consider the Two-Bit Idiot dishonest (as should every rational individual) unless he is able to realize this mistake worthy of his name, admits that he was wrong, repents, and starts working towards correcting it in short order. Don't expect tolerance for idiotic behavior.
P.S.: Similar logic can be applied to some other whistleblower cases and it is a shame that documents otherwise containing truth get controlled by people of such low morals and/or cognitive abilities.

**I'd say it is active support**. By no means can it be considered passive support, when money carries value and can be exchanged for goods and labor. Maybe you could say it is *indirect* support, since it is support through a middleman, but it's still active support.
Whether a fiat currency or something like bitcoin, there is nothing to give it value except what people are willing to *give* in exchange for it. Well, if you were some kind of person that *wants* to pay taxes (in fiat currency) then that would be another thing to give value to the currency in your mind, but that would clearly and unquestionably be active support for the government. And when a fiat currency has value, the central bank can (and in practice does) extract wealth from you, for as long as you hold the currency, when they increase the supply of the currency.
This means that when you do so much as own a dollar bill for a minute, you are actively supporting the Federal Reserve and through it, the government.

Those particular coins that came from the SR users are really something you would not want to bid for, no matter how you look at it.
They are both **heavily tainted**, for having been used for drugs and other things which many consider immoral, *and* **stolen** since at least part of them still properly belong to SR users, not all of whom have been involved in illegal or immoral activities. I haven't seen (nor can I imagine) how confiscating all money on a market just because the money was held there could be properly justified. The place was only advertised as a free market, not as a market for assassins, right? Did those guys who apparently hadn't broken any law and tried to get their seized coins back get them back in the end? I don't see any bitcoins going out of the wallet.
The point here is, you just don't want to bid for something that is known to be someone else's property. Every pawn shop knows enough not to accept anything that is known not to rightfully belong to the customer offering it, because the rightful owner will very likely claim it back. In the case of bitcoins, the proof is written right on the blockchain, for all eternity.
At the same time, anyone thinking of bidding needs to think where their USD would go and whether or not that is really what they want to do.


Why would you want that? That would be equivalent to maximizing the amount of USD the US Marshals get. Is that desirable to you? If so, why?
If instead the coins were to be bought below market by an arbitrageur and then sold at exchanges, would it not be wiser and much easier (at least no organization would be needed) to simply place your bids at the exchanges? That would make perfect sense if the goal is to keep the bitcoin exchange rate from falling.
Do you want to prevent any "arbitrageur" from profiting (in practice there are always risks and costs and so the word "arbitrageur" may be kind of a misnomer here)? Do you really want to take the same risks, costs and responsibilities that such an "arbitrageur" would be taking?

Your choice still allows you to:
* avoid getting in the position of being owed money; or
* when you do get in the position of being owed money make sure that the other party agrees beforehand (in a legally binding way) to repay you in another currency, such as bitcoin.
My understanding is (although I'm not a lawyer) that in this way you can reduce the risk of legal tender laws being invoked against you to relatively few situations (e.g. a debt arises when someone unexpectedly does bodily harm to you and the court orders them to pay you money - there is no prior agreement and I see no way to convince the court that such a debt should be paid in a different form).

You have a good observation there that just half a year after the FED was created and monetary expansion exploded, WWI started.
The thing is, if you only use bitcoins and don't pay any taxes you no longer have any *responsibility* for any wars the governments might fight. You simply play no part in it. You have that choice now. It is somewhat harder to do that with gold, simply because if it can be physically located it can be stolen from you, and this also makes securely transacting in it more complicated.

Barry Silbert remarks that "if it was cocaine they'd throw it away", which is indeed a very interesting comparison but in a different context.
So if you compare the ***actual effects on the market*** of the two approaches - destroying versus auctioning off you will see that those cocaine producers, traffickers and dealers that don't get caught actually get reduced competition and less supply on the market when the government destroys drugs. Thus, assuming inelastic demand (we are talking about drug addicts here), those fortunate producers, traffickers and dealers get more profit than they otherwise would have (at the expense of the ones that have been jailed or lost their product, but the same is true for any confiscation). On the other hand, bitcoin holders don't get such unexpected privilege when bitcoins are confiscated, except for the period of time until auction when the bitcoins are held off the market. In that period the float (supply) drops below what it otherwise would have been, but then later it rises above it as the bitcoins hit the market all at the same time.
Thus, in some ways some drug producers, traffickers and dealers receive substantial support from the government, whereas bitcoin holders are left with a lousy "legitimized by government" stamp (as if that is a good thing).

Bitcoin makes it very easy and accessible for anyone to save money in a way that cannot be physically stolen or potentially even found at all. You are right that there have always been ways to do that, but they have been imperfect and inconvenient at best, and they have continuously been fought against, with increasing success. I think when someone wants to steal or legally confiscate some assets, the preferred and most effective way has been (assuming no confession from the owner): find the assets without hoping for any help from the owner or even relying on potentially misleading information coming from the owner. Find third parties that the owner might rely on, such as custodians, foreign banks, partners, witnesses, etc. and go from there. Use metal detectors, surveillance, or simple brute force for opening safes, etc. to find and get some types of assets. If it is held with a third party, pressure them in all possible ways and at all levels, until the assets are forfeited.
You know that we need something better at hiding and storing money than what we have now when even Swiss banks ditch centuries old traditions and hard earned reputation and abolish banking secrecy and, worse yet, betray customers even for keeping the wealth itself. Most other "safe havens" have also been pressured successfully. If you've followed the news you already know that. Faced with these developments, someone who was not well versed with all these arcane mechanisms to hide or protect money to begin with could find it very useful to be able to hide and protect money with no trusted third parties at all, and no need for physically securing or hiding anything. It is extremely cheap and very convenient and accessible.
I think the above methods have been much more preferred and effective than any approach relying on the owner's cooperation. Cooperating with the owner would be the second best thing for the one seeking the property, but it would require making concessions to the owner. Sure, there have been frustrated attempts at seizing property and people getting pissed off for it and reacting with senseless cruelty and brutality, but there is really nothing more to it than that. Aggression and threats can only antagonize the owner and preclude any cooperation, but not produce any useful information from an *interested owner*.


You are so very wrong about that. If violence is the name of the game, there will be opposition. If you lose and the gun is being held to your head, then *will* and *belief* makes all the difference. Firstly, I, for one, am a person who you simply cannot 'break the will' of, and I am definitely not unique in that. In fact, it would be necessary to somehow instill will to divulge the passphrase - it is not like you just give up and it happens, passively (as can happen in e.g. fighting for something). Secondly, it becomes a matter of a very important decision: would you rather provide a considerable material support to someone who is exhibiting aggression, threatening people's lives, intending to steal, and would very likely continue to do so in the future, especially if encouraged by your very material help; *or* would you rather make their whole effort totally worthless, have them eat their costs getting nothing from you, while your wealth either goes to someone you would want it to go to (e.g. stays with you if you get out alive, or to someone you gave keys to or used some other mechanism to have it transferred to), or, failing that, if it is a currency it would simply stay unspendable forever, decrease the supply of that currency, hence making everyone still holding such a currency a bit richer, which would mostly **not** be the same people threatening your life and property (they would obviously be the ones in desperate need for it). This could very well be your last decision in life, and the one you would be *remembered for*, when you consider that if you are under a credible threat for your life you have absolutely no reason to expect that the threat will be removed (you will not be killed regardless) if the wealth is given away. You will not give anything away if you strongly believe it is the right thing to do. If you actually hold some sympathy with your assailants, then that's a different matter. Decide reasonably.

Actually, this is a necessary, but not sufficient condition. Bitcoin is just an idea. If it had any baggage, like some kind of centralization or authority, it would be like a mass that would tip the plank. But since it has no mass, the plank could stay in balance for a long time if undisturbed.
I think the realistic model for Bitcoin is right there on that picture - people (though there has to be more than one person if it is going to be actually *practiced*) vested with the Bitcoin idea walking on firm ground.

Voting and the *option* of voting is not the same thing. This is your error.
Voting is voluntary. More people being allowed to vote is not in itself bad, overall, whether you think voting (in government related votes) is good or bad. Think about it. Imagine you are not allowed to vote. You are in a conversation related to politics with someone. He tells you something like "yeah, you say you are against going to the voting booth or against this or that thing related to government, but I bet you'd go to the booth if you had the right to! It's easy for you to say that, since you can't go anyway!" Now, wouldn't it be nice if you were able to prove that you don't have the desire to vote even if allowed to? Isn't it also nice when sometimes you know that a particular person has voted in a particular election and thus you have an objective indicator that that person is interested in the matter of who gets elected for a particular government position. It may well turn out bad for the people who choose to vote, but keeping them from voting doesn't do any good.

Leaving aside thoughts on the infatuation with the mainstream that oozes out of this post, I can tell you this:
Whatever we **hope** for does not have any effect on the **current reality**. MtGox is already either underwater or not. Whatever decision or circumstance there was that led to the current situation already happened long ago. So us just hoping cannot in any way help MtGox or Bitcoin or anyone or anything.
The only way hope can have an effect on reality is if one makes a *decision to act* based on such a hope. I shudder to think that you might want to imply that someone should actually *use their money* based on hope **overriding any consideration for how MtGox already acts right now** (e.g. depositing money without any indication whether it would ever be seen again, not to mention what it would be used for).

Not necessarily. First of all, at some point the guy with the podium is almost certainly made well aware by the crowd about the precariousness of his situation and is given ample chance to return on firm ground safely. A rational person would get it and do the right thing for himself and the rest. I do recognize that eventually the podium will be occupied by an irrational person, who, chances dictate, will inevitably exist. You can find all kinds of people. By that time every rational person in the crowd would already be perfectly aware of the situation and what needs to be done. It will be so obvious and for so long that they would have the opportunity to devise various different strategies, including cooperative ones. They could agree to step off all at the same time.
By the way, you will also have some irrational opposition people who will stay where they are no matter what, so they will somewhat counterbalance the guy with the podium, but it is unclear whether a tipping point would be reached or not. If not, the rational ones could get away safely even without the need for cooperation and the irrational ones can be safely ignored. I like this scenario for its more forgiving nature.
All in all, the best strategy is to simply step away ASAP.

If someone can prove that they deposited X coins on date Y into the wallet that was later seized they would also need SR's books and records, which should be kept as evidence at the moment. Those books can prove the ultimate share of the total balance at the time SR stopped operating. [Proof of solvency]( would be very useful for the users (they would have sufficient evidence in their hands without needing the whole books) and that would be one more reason to demand it from every bitcoin business that holds bitcoins on behalf of customers.
The SR case is complicated by the fact that there is a theft and forcible shut down at the same time. If an operating business had its customer funds stolen the business would be the one that would be proving ownership and demanding the money back and only then would they be returning money to customers.


Let's think about it.
A victim of a theft Alice proves that she is the last rightful owner of the coins (specific transaction output(s)). Bob is a merchant and Bob has decided to respect the owner's property rights and therefore Bob has openly declared that he follows this protocol and doesn't accept stolen coins as payment and returns such coins to the rightful owner. Upon hearing of the theft and of Alice's proof Bob puts the specific transaction outputs in a list (which can be public). Bob receives a payment for merchandise from Carol tainted with 10% stolen coins rightfully belonging to Alice (10% of the amount can be traced back to Alice's stolen coins, regardless of how many and what transactions they went through). Bob immediately returns 10% of that payment to Alice (regardless of the total amount that Alice is missing). Bob tells Carol that 10% of the coins she sent had been stolen and returned as per protocol. Bob offers Carol to either supplement the payment with 10% more untainted coins to complete the order or get refunded for the 90% untainted coins that were sent.
Carol learns the lesson that it is better to never even acquire stolen property.
Eve was the thief and she has coins that are 100% tainted. Eve has understood the protocol and Bob's following of that protocol. Eve will not even try to send those coins to Bob, even though she really wants Bob's merchandise. Eve has fewer options to benefit from stolen property.
Eve learns the lesson that it is better to never even steal in the first place and might even decide to join the protocol.

In such case you would need to get access to (be it only once and briefly) a secure computer and the internet, or trust somebody else to do it for you (prepare a "plan B" in advance).
This is conceptually similar to burying a stash of gold or silver in a secret location in that the only thing you need to keep securely is the secret (your own memory and will is all you need). Similarly to the risk described above, if you bury precious metals in a secret location someone might discover them (maybe using better future technology), in which case there might be no recourse.

Like we were just talking about cost effectiveness...
However, they usually lock a person up only if they find that the person has broken their law or at least that he/she attracts too much of their attention.
I am saying that Bitcoin allows the possibility of running many types of businesses solely under a pseudonym and never revealing the connection to your physical identity. Failing that, with Bitcoin it is possible for you to at least prevent them from taking the money from you. Thus, you have the real option of at least preventing your *wealth and being* going towards immoral activity. It is, of course, limited, and certainly not for everybody, but it is still a great new possibility.
This is also only one of many new possibilities that Bitcoin brings. Different people will do different things with Bitcoin.


Not necessarily, but I would say that if people decided not to pay taxes, right now they would also want to start using Bitcoin to help them in multiple different ways.


When I wrote it, my intention was not to argue in favor of this (it is a slightly different topic). My point is that you cannot directly end all war, but you can entirely stop supporting it, if you so chose, and that Bitcoin makes this option much easier, more attractive and widely attainable than it was before.
Why are you concerned about war, really? Is it because you are for people's right to life, property and freedom? If so, then wouldn't your **first priority** be to make sure that you don't support any violation of these rights? If you supported even just one violation, then could you ever expect that the violations would stop there or that you wouldn't become a victim yourself?

In my opinion the social norm that bitcoins are owned and can have their ownership transferred the same way tangible objects can, is already firmly established. In other words, there is an association between the bitcoin amount on a given address and a person, outside of the fact that someone may have control over those bitcoins (the control being enforced by the Bitcoin protocol, through possession of a private key + the record in the blockchain). So I think we can talk of *possession* - which is when you control the private key, and of *ownership* - which is when the bitcoins are considered to rightfully belong to you.
Evidence of this being the norm is plenty: the fact that so many people protest the *theft* of bitcoins, the instances when someone would somehow come into possession of somebody else's private key and would later return control over the bitcoins to the *rightful owner*, etc. There are, of course, evidence of the contrary, but I am confident that one day the social norm of bitcoin ownership will be turned into a law by a legitimate and widely recognized court of law.

Your scheme has much the same sort of risks as the older ways to store wealth (the banking system or physical assets), only it has undesirable security characteristics that amplify the risks because of Bitcoin's nature.
Since you are so opposed to relying on one's memory I assume that at least some of your geographically dispersed copies are not hidden in a location or encrypted with a password that can't be found out any other way than you divulging it or that can't be bruteforced (or searched, in case of hiding) given a reasonable amount of effort and time. You may (actually should) be using a [secret sharing scheme]( but that would increase the risk of destruction, which you seem to be focusing on. With secret sharing there is a trade-off between the risk of destruction and the risk of theft. In any case, as part of your scheme you must have a routine of periodically checking *all copies* (or, in the case of a *m of n* secret sharing scheme, *at least *n-m*+1 of the shares*) for 1) presence, 2) authenticity (i.e. that they have not been swapped with a different similarly looking paper/medium) *and* 3) **lack of tampering or surveillance**. That last part is crucial for bitcoins. I am sure that today there are plenty of methods to read what's on a tamper-resistant piece of paper, from the basic shining of a flash light through the simpler ones, through endoscopes, to x-ray and microwave scanners and God knows what if the stakes are high enough. 
If you don't do all of this somehow, a malicious party could secretly read one of your copies, or enough shares, find the necessary insecure passwords and steal your bitcoins, all before you suspect a thing. Don't just assume that there can't be such parties that operate globally in an organized way that can pull something like this off, because both common sense and real world evidence clearly shows that there can be and indeed are currently such malicious organizations.
I don't think that the *history* of paper physical security really applies in the age of x-rays and other fancy technologies and with an asset whose security relies not merely on the paper's presence and authenticity but, most importantly, on **the secrecy of the information printed on it**.
Are you really confident that you can reasonably and reliably manage all those risks? Taking the above in mind, do you understand why doing physical security for Bitcoin paperwallets without strong information security (involving *memorizing secrets*) is even less reliable than when you are securing physical wealth?
Why try to fit Bitcoin in the old security paradigms anyway? Bitcoin gives you the opportunity to diversify your risks, so that the part of your wealth that is in bitcoin can be completely immune to some of the risks that affect your physical assets. Since the crucial thing about securing bitcoins is the secrecy of information, you might as well start off by utilizing the security and convenience of the human brain. Now, since you want to construct a scheme that works for your estate and family, you can use cryptography for that. You can incorporate a secret sharing scheme, e.g. *m* of *m*. You can give your *m* relatives one share each to memorize. Those *m* people could be the ones who are supposed to inherit the bitcoins, or you could do *m* of *m*+1 and include a trusted third party like a judge to resolve disputes. You would personally remember the cleartext seed or passphrase from which the shares can be regenerated. You would only need to make sure that everyone remembers their share. In case one of those people can no longer participate for whatever reason, shares could be redistributed or you could even store that person's share insecurely or reveal it publicly without reducing the security of your seed/passphrase (assuming the secret sharing scheme itself is secure and you don't reveal *m* shares to third parties), so that the remaining participants don't have to memorize new shares.
You should also take into account that having your property stolen, considering all the consequences, costs you and the people around you more than having your property destroyed. This is also part of the calculation involved in managing risk.

I don't know the answer to that question either. However, I don't see where you're going with that question. It could be that there has been a trend towards fewer players, but I see absolutely no reason to assume that any trend would hold for the future.
It certainly is true that some people have been able to build large scale mining operations, but that is to be expected with the mining reward going up tremendously in real terms (due to the exchange rate going up).
There are three parameters there: number of players, total hashing power and statistical dispersion (like a Gini coefficient). However, whatever the current data points and trends are, I've spent some time studying various dynamics around monopolies and cartels and I am not particularly worried for the long run.

Look, there are a few different notions here. You have *fiat money*, which is money defined or imposed by a decree or a law (authority). Examples of fiat money: Euro, US dollar, which has gone through different legal definitions, etc. Fiat money is only one type of money in general. Money - general notion. Fiat money - particular, specific type. Money can be defined, as:
***An agreement among a group of people for a common medium of exchange***
You see that it is more general, don't you? An *agreement* can very well be an implicit one. Let me give you a couple of examples of a moneys that are not fiat moneys. For most of human history *gold, as measured by its pure weight* and *silver, as measured by its pure weight* have been two global forms of money. The particular unit of weight or the shape or form of the gold is besides the notion of *money*. Money is the broadest notion. So you can simply say gold is money, silver is money. You can also say something like "I have more money than you do, because my gold dust weighs more than yours".
What you and the article is talking about is **fiat money**, not **money in general**. From what I read in the article, it looks like they've completely disregarded all the other forms of money. They should have put this definition under "fiat money" or something like that, because the way it is is just dishonest.


Such an excuse cannot be valid because there was plenty of international trade at the time. Usually one independent nation or individual would accept the coins of another based on their precious metal content and free market value. There is no authority above all nations and individuals defining an universal form of fiat money. Well if they thought the world is Britannia, then maybe.


Sure, hence *fiat* in *fiat money*.
Bitcoin is of course not fiat money, so you can see that there is nothing in the excerpt from the article that hints at anything like bitcoin, which is a shame.
BTW, this quote:

@_date: 2014-05-16 16:52:52
This is a very important and deep analysis. 
One thing which can alleviate at least the transaction volume consideration, but more generally the issue of volatility of mining revenue would be separation of the mining layer from the logic layer of cryptocurrencies (the verification of transactions) so that miners have more streams of revenue, while altchains get better security. Think approaches such treechains and sidechains. For a long time I've had the idea that proof of work mining will eventually somehow evolve to become an industry independent from the specific application on top (kind of like a notary industry). Chains other than Bitcoin can experiment with many forms of incentives for miners, such as block subsidies, transaction fees, demurrage, etc., the total of which will hopefully be less volatile, helped by some free market mechanisms.
As for the costs of running full nodes - I don't know what can mitigate this.
All of the things you explained will have to be considered while the necessary evolution happens. Thanks for sharing this!

Interesting. So what you need is *proof of publication*.
When you have your unique Bitcoin address that is enough to have authentication. I don't see any point for a second, different key pair for that (e.g. PGP) if you don't have that established already. You need to securely distribute your public key in some way either way if people are to know that the predictions came from you. So you could, for example, meet personally the people who you want to be able to prove predictions to from your name and hand them your Bitcoin address (or public key). Then you will use this address' private key solely for these proof of publication transactions. You need to timely reveal all your predictions, otherwise you would lose your trustworthiness. So I think this protocol would need to include time/date when each prediction is to be revealed.
I don't think it is necessary to encrypt anything - you could do the job with a [salted hash]( Basically, you make sure every prediction message has enough randomness in it (this is needed to prevent attackers revealing your predictions prematurely) by putting a large random number (salt) next to the message and then just hashing it, the same way e.g. ( does it. When it is time to prove the prediction, you just publish the exact message (together with the salt).
People who know your proof-of-prediction Bitcoin address (public key) can look up all the transactions in the blockchain signed by your public key (in other words, originating from that address) and get all the prediction messages for expired predictions that you've published and verify them.
Using hashes is simpler and it allows you to use arbitrarily large prediction messages. On the other hand, if you use encryption you could achieve some nice properties. You could ensure that the prediction gets revealed after some roughly predictable amount of time, no matter what happens to you or to the secret data you would otherwise have to store. The encrypted message is already publicly available in the blockchain, so you only need to make sure the decryption key becomes available. For that you can use [Peter Todd's Timelock]( or something similar.
I hope someone more competent than me helps towards this idea because I like the concept.

I think this would break Bitcoin's security, which relies on there not being fast algorithms for certain problems.

By all means, if someone can propose a scheme that is beneficial to society, the internet or the planet (assuming you mean besides fulfilling the needs of the currency and payment system and other applications built on top of the blockchain themselves), it could eventually be incorporated into Bitcoin or an alternative cryptocurrency.
However, there are a few important requirements, among which: it should be possible to verify it with very high probability or certainty and the verification should be very easy and cheap for everyone. These simple requirements alone are actually somewhat hard to fulfill and are where most of the stuff you can think of would fail.
An important point, which I don't know how deeply you've thought about is: who is to say exactly what is beneficial to society, the internet or the planet? So many things in this world turn out to have various unfathomable consequences and aspects when you actually *think deeply* about them. Are you looking for something that has only 'good' (whatever that means) or 'neutral' effects and absolutely no 'bad' effects?
For Bitcoin's proof of work based on hashes I can see the following positive or neutral effects (besides fulfilling the needs of the currency and payment system and other applications built on top of the blockchain):
* The hashes themselves have neutral effect - they are pretty useless outside of Bitcoin. One day, if the difficulty gets orders of magnitude higher, the first collisions of SHA-256 might accidentally be found on the blockchain. Cryptographers will like this (and a lot of software projects would likely have to look for a new algorithm).
* The need for computing power will greatly incentivise and stimulate the advancement of hardware technology. Perhaps even quantum computing, which some see as a threat, but is something positive on itself and something that wouldn't at all make cryptocurrency impossible.
* In mining there is also a strong incentive for miners to establish low latency connections between each other, and to a lesser extent to other nodes. They might also want very reliable internet connections, private connections, anonymous connections, high bandwidth connections, etc. These things right there stimulate the advancement of the internet.
* Proof of work also incentivises the development of cheap energy sources, since in computing energy is inevitably one of the most important costs.
Those are just the most obvious ones.
By the way, some have proposed and implemented search for long chains of nearly doubled prime numbers, which are useful in some fields of mathematics and cryptology/cryptography.

So you would refuse to do what everyone else in the world would hope anyone in that position would do - reveal the thief. You would not let anyone know that that person has committed theft and help the theft go unrecognized and uncorrected. You would also refuse to admit the theft that you've done, and therefore you would be unable to correct it. You say you don't think stealing is right, but then it turns out that you don't intend to correct what is wrong. So you would add not one but two more bad decisions over the first act of stealing.
So you would make some serious compromises at least in the name of theft, even though you think theft itself is wrong.

In this way you create a link between three things:
* The information itself, which can be downloaded via any source and channel, even an untrusted ones, and then verified to match the hash.
* A Bitcoin address of the signatory which, of course, has a corresponding private key owned by the signatory. It can be used for many things, e.g. to receive donations, to receive and decrypt encrypted messages, to sign messages and include other data in the blockchain. The address, of course, links to all its past transactions and current balance of bitcoins (e.g. to prove existence of collateral).
* The time, roughly, when it happened. It proves that the information existed before that time.
It is possible now, only I don't know of any user friendly tools that can do this. The specific feature that allows this (in a somewhat nice way) is referred to as OP_RETURN. You can check [this website]( to see all the data (some of it is in plaintext) that has been included currently in the blockchain using OP_RETURN.

Plot twist: The burglars who stole the safe did break into it quickly and then figured out what the paper inside is, perhaps by sending photos of it it to another close and trusted colleague who quickly explained to them roughly what they're dealing with. They looked up the address, realized how much money they have on their hands, and, without completely understanding how Bitcoin works and not thinking much of it, being high on the idea that they are now rich, immediately started partying, took pictures of each other holding the loot, then late in the night each of them went home. Late in the day when they sobered up each of them looks up the address again and finds out that all the money is gone. It's all gone, transferred while they were still sleeping. Now each of them starts suspecting their otherwise well trusted partners in crime (was it the guy who held the wallet overnight, was it the guy who made sure everyone else got inebriated by providing large amounts of booze, was it the only guy who knew what Bitcoin was who was asked to help identify the loot, was it the guy with the idea to take all those pictures). They even find out about this topic and suspect that it is a deliberate disinformation campaign by one of their partners, perhaps even in collusion with the real victims or the police who have made a secret deal in exchange for part of the money. They turn on each other and now you have a bunch of criminals dead set on "getting their cut back" or seeking revenge.

The words "stolen" and "theft" are pretty clear, even intuitively, outside of a centrally controlled legal system. I think that somehow people will be able to tell what is a theft and what is not without relying on a centralized legal system. This is the context in which I am saying all of this, in case it is not already apparent: decentralized and private legal systems. It is the framework in which legal systems have worked for thousands of years anyway. Even what you referred to as the "current legal system" is working within the same natural social frameworks, it is just that it is a legal system that has been so dominant and long-lasting that one is tempted to look at it as *the* legal system where all justice comes from and to forget the forces that are behind it.
Of course, there are no eternal or omnipotent things among man-made structures.


Yes, this underscores the fact that Bitcoin is not a system with a perfectly fungible medium of exchange. If you want a more fungible cryptocurrency you need an appropriate design incorporating things such as zero-knowledge proofs. I would welcome such developments because I see the value in them. Less demand from users who seek such fungibility would indeed lower the value of a bitcoin somewhat but I think I can live with that. What I proposed has positive sides too, so I don't think that it would be a net negative for us or for cryptocurrencies as a whole. Fungible and traceable/transparent currencies are distinct things with distinct uses and merits - they both have their own place.


Then it is not so convenient after all, is it? Things are not always what they seem. There is a need and an opportunity for alternative legal systems to emerge.
The simple heuristic that I suggested of looking at the percentage of taint works regardless of what or how many transactions happen. With tumblers and mixers the tainted coins simply get spread out with more people. They stay there somewhere. Such a protocol fulfills its primary role of discouraging theft and the support of thieves.


I don't think that this is any more true than saying that "Bitcoin businesses will have higher prices to deal with the overhead of running full nodes and paying for mining".


You would just have the incentive to try to get untainted coins. The merchant would want to make clear what coins are considered stolen. You wouldn't risk unexpected loss because you would want to at least watch the merchant's list or even join the protocol fully if you want to trade with such people. In practice tainted and untainted coins would be like two different currencies with a somewhat different value and places where they circulate.

When I asked this I was expecting a definite "NO" answer, since all examples and criteria thus far discussed imply that, but I **still don't see it stated explicitly and unequivocally**. If a definite "NO" answer is not the right answer, then even with the phrase and the rule, stated in 5 words or less, there is some additional entropy. This means either that if you apply that at most 5 word rule to the phrase you've given you may get more than one possible result or that you might have to revise your statement that the rule can be described in 5 words or less.

As I said, in order to mine, one inevitably needs to have access to the data that populates all the fields in the header, especially the hash pointing to the previous block. With getwork you can reverse the pre-processing and get the 80-byte block header (as described here:  get the second field (hashPrevBlock) and this is all you need to know to find out if it's more worthwhile to jump to another, protocol-abiding pool.
Given this knowledge (the idea of fair-weather mining), you need to realize this: The idea that a pool could somehow earn and distribute more than its proportional share of mining revenue in the short (not actually promised with selfish mining anyway, due to orphaned blocks and the 2016-block difficulty readjustment period and also due to withholding time and risk of losing races), medium or long term would be a fallacy. The mere fact that most miners would know about the fair-weather strategy ruins it. Therefore, any promise by a pool operator that participants would be receiving more than their fair share of mining revenues would be fraudulent! It can't possibly be met, given that there is at least one alternative strategy for miners (fair-weather mining) that can't be prevented and that is more advantageous for miners. And fair-weather mining is at least more profitable in the short term, because solving a block for a protocol-abiding pool while the selfish pool or pools are *not* ahead *guarantees* a reward (leaving aside latency considerations), which would not be the case if following selfish mining only.

You've piqued my curiosity now. What is this scientific prediction which others can use in order to influence outcomes but presumably the one making the prediction can't use in order to influence outcomes? I presume this, because you can't go around the fact that the one publishing the prediction knows the content of the prediction. If there is any perceived risk that you may be affecting the outcomes towards the prediction turning out to be true then the scheme doesn't work to prove *good* predictions, perhaps only to prove ability to influence outcomes.
I don't think you can use proofofexistence.com directly for your purpose, since their service asks for a payment to their address and I guess they publish all their proofs through their own Bitcoin addresses over which you do not have control, and therefore there will be no way to get all the predictions made by you. I guess it may work good enough if you provide the transaction ID to everyone you want to prove to, before the outcome is known, for every single prediction you make, but then you wouldn't need the blockchain. If you want to prove your full and unaltered prediction history you should use your own Bitcoin address (or some other equivalent approach). So maybe you could use their [source code]( and run their application yourself or make your own similar application.

This seems to completely ignore the demand curve for block space. When blocks are not full the price per byte is not necessarily zero, as seen historically. But even if it was, when we get to the point where SegWit blocks are full we would get up the curve and the price would not be zero. I think that just as the network is functioning fine now with full blocks, it would be OK and not unreasonable to delay SegWit activation until there is a transaction flow large enough to fill the new larger blocks.
The quantity would be higher - miners would get fees from more transactions. I don't know exactly what the whole demand curve would be, so I won't make a thorough prediction how their revenue would change at different points in the future. But I think it's entirely possible that their fee revenue goes up, not down, if/when the block size increases through SegWit or whatever. I believe that with more users who want to do more transactions we will get to a point where the price per byte would not drop much with an increase in quantity (block size). In economic terms, the concerned portion of the demand curve would be said to be elastic. You can see a visual representation of these concepts in the graph in [this article]( Only, unlike in the article, in the case of block space it is the quantity, not the price, which is the parameter which is being changed, and it increases, i.e. changes to the right on the graph. This means that I believe that the fee revenue calculation will make miners more desirous of an increase in block size, not less desirous, as time goes by and popularity of the network increases. Furthermore, I believe that the fee revenue calculation will become a more important factor in their decision making than other considerations (such as fixed costs for more network and processing capacity for their nodes; potentially lower revenue due to higher stale block rates).

How about SegWit without the increase in block size (let's call it "SegWit lite")? You could make two separate soft fork proposals: one for SegWit lite and one for a larger block size limit (with weighing for witness data, if in combination with SegWit). I bet that the first one will get to 95% really fast. The second one would probably have higher support than the current SegWit, too.
If you want to go to a less safe approach why go from 95% support threshold to completely indeterminate support? Why not first go from 95% support threshold to, say, 80% support threshold (and I don't know how safe this is). And it's not only that it's less safe, it's also more likely to drive away people (specifically miners) from Bitcoin. That's what happens if you ignore what they are trying to tell you and instead issue an ultimatum. A portion of those 5% or 20% who don't signal for a soft fork would be unhappy and leave, and that would be a loss to everybody. We would be better off without a soft fork than with a large group of unhappy people leaving.

If you look up the names of the hard fork proposals you will see that they do have logos (be they somewhat unoriginal ones). And that is not surprising. A minority hard fork would need its own brand, since it likely creates a new currency. It reinforces the feeling that the hard fork proposals are not about a better Bitcoin, but about new brands and some unstated agenda related to new brands.
And in this context, I don't think SegWit needs to, or should be a brand. But I don't see evidence that any important stakeholders (such as the Core developers) are trying to make it a brand, either. It could simply be that someone decided to make a logo just for fun, and once it was done, why not use it? I do see its value as a badge indicating compatibility with a standard.

I should probably tip the guy who made the python script that I modified and used for the bruteforcing part (not the part that generated candidate passphrases) though.

The winning mask was at number 24, as one of the least likely (so I thought). The wordlist contained all possible 1 to 3 character long strings with all 95 characters, English dictionary words and names of length 4 and 5 and a few manually added keywords. All in all a 1GB file containing candidate passphrases (the biggest one I attempted to use).

That would only make sense if there are significant liquidity issues, in other words, those people find it difficult or slow to obtain bitcoins through the market. Such people would more properly be considered speculators (or hoarders, savers, investors or whatever you want to call them) first and foremost, and only then miners.
This behavior has certainly played a role in the early days, but now, with many exchanges, bitcoin auctions and a lower and decreasing rate of increase of the stock of bitcoins through mining, this kind of behavior should be greatly diminishing.
Maybe you could see a few people mine until cost = market ASK price, instead of cost &lt; market BID, which is what miners should normally be doing, but that would not be much of a phenomenon to speak of (it would be interesting if we could get reliable real time data about it, but we probably can't).

SegWit is not backwards compatible with blocks created in older software after activation.

So, you are voluntarily putting yourself in a position where talk alone could manipulate you into moving a lot of money in whichever direction a manipulator wants you to. Because talk is practically all that is required to manufacture a hard fork and convince you that it is "the real deal". Make no mistake about it, there are people out there who plot how to profit from people's weaknesses such as the one you revealed here. To manufacture a hard fork one only needs to convince the most gullible miner (doesn't matter the hash rate) to mine the fork, and then the rest of the trouble is about creating the impression of support for it. It can all be achieved through a lot of talk, marketing, perception management, sleigh of hand, etc. If you're so manipulable that you can't interpret the metrics (e.g. share of hashing power) and merits (which one is more secure, allows fair competition in mining, etc.) of forks then you're probably holding BTC for the wrong reasons, and so you better sell it now, before the manipulation is as bad as you think it may become (because you'd lose more money if you sold then). If you're not so manipulable then you wouldn't buy or sell based on talks of things you don't understand well enough. You'd bring your level of understanding in line with the size of your hodlings or you'd cut your hodlings commensurate to your level of understanding.

I have an idea why this is. A major portion of the support for this hard fork proposal is rooted in the desire to create a contentious hard fork and the things which that would bring. There are a lot of interesting manipulation games that can be played after a hard fork occurs. For one, a hard fork creates a new currency, and certain people are in very good positions to influence which fork miners (and other stakeholders) choose and have inside information as to these preferences. This creates an opportunity for profiting through manipulating miners into supporting your bets or for insider trading.
The people best positioned for profiting in these games are large pool operators, influential developers and traders and fraudsters with experience in pump and dump schemes. The malicious among them know that they only need a hard fork, any hard fork, to activate and then the game is on.

It was bad. The forking side (the Ethereum Foundation's) didn't implement even basic things that could have prevented such exploitation, boldly claiming that there would be zero support for the no-fork side. Several exchanges believed the Foundation and were drained of all their ETC (no-fork side) by some of their users.  Others were ready for this and split their ETH and ETC. They had a few ways to split them, including a smart contract specifically for the purpose. You could move all your "bitcoin1" and "bitcoin2" to different addresses, with a small risk that it fails due to a replay attack and you lose a transaction fee, but more importantly, you should first make sure that the new client for "Bitcoin2" does not do anything fishy with your private key! If you first send all your "bitcoin1" (trusted software) to an entirely new **wallet**, not just a new address in your deterministic wallet and wait for a good number of confirmations (at least 6, maybe longer if the blockchain you've chosen is at risk of some long reorganizations due to ongoing competition with another fork) only then would it be safe to risk compromising your old private keys on a not-so-trusted "Bitcoin2" client (and better do it on a sandbox if you suspect an outright malware).
If you see a new shitfork "Bitcoin2" activate you may be tempted to dump it all ASAP for more bitcoins, but don't forget the risk that it may be a cleverly disguised scam designed to steal your Bitcoin private keys and thus all your bitcoins!

This isn't really relevant, because for the scheme to really work it is crucial that the whole history of predictions from a predictor is verified, which would probably be too much work to do manually, so it has to be written as a new software. On the other hand, the content of all predictions from a predictor need to be ultimately manually interpreted by human beings somehow if this scheme is to have any usefulness. They need to be checked to see if the events really make sense, if the predictions really show that the predictor has statistically significant good predicting abilities.
What I see as the main use for this scheme is "proof of being an insider". You could use it to prove that you have inside information and/or power to affect some outcomes, possibly while maintaining privacy (pseudonymity). For example, you work at a company and want to gain a reputation as a provider of inside information, but you want to hide your real identity from your bosses and you also want to prevent them from manipulating the outcomes in the last minute just to make your good predictions bad. 
Another use could be for a scientist who has a theory about something but, for some reason, wants to prove the practical usefulness of his theory through multiple predictions over time before revealing the theory itself (e.g. the theory may be too complex and time consuming to properly explain and/or his/her peers may not have the patience to listen) but in this use case affecting the outcome of predictions would probably not be an issue and so the predictions could be public from the start (but the other aspects of the scheme are still needed and I don't see a simpler way to do this).
Given a specific use case, additional logic can be written to automate some of the verification. E.g. if you are leaking a number from a periodical report, code could automate the process of verifying the accuracy of the predictions by parsing the report; verifying that the prediction (hash) was published before the report was made public; etc.

If miners consider it important to minimize the amount of data they have to transmit for a solved block, they would want to change the way the block data is transmitted. They could start by sending only the header plus coinbase transaction and instead of whole transactions that every node already has they could include only transaction hashes. By the way, this would also add more incentive for miners to verify and relay transactions to all nodes as soon as they receive them. Mining nodes already have the incentive to try to collect and verify unconfirmed transactions, but for those nodes who for whatever reason don't have a transaction with a given hash at that moment, those transactions can be sent afterwards, as a second priority. Most mining nodes will likely already have them and be able to start mining on the next block extremely quickly.
If we have a maximum of about 6000 transaction in a 1MB block that would make about 6000*32=192000 bytes data that needs to be transmitted for a solved block, using 256 bit transaction hashes. If 128 bit hashes were used (I think this would not reduce security, because the Merkle tree would need to be verified anyway), it would go below 100KB, and in practice it would be significantly lower than that on average.

I've talked a lot for a long time about soft forks and how they work, and how an activation in this unsafe way would lead to a split, for sure if less than 50% of the hashpower supports it. This post was specifically concerning the case of &lt;50% support and how the author of the proposal and some of its proponents try to sell a deception about the illusory hashpower signalling rate and the fragility of the whole scheme.
Read this from the author:




@_date: 2017-03-05 04:25:18
was talking about a scenario where the SegWit-valid side got only a negligible share of the hash rate. If this persisted for any economically significant amount of time, but later  reversed and got more than 50%, the SegWit-invalid chain users (there would be some of those, after all it would have been the only functioning chain), and especially those new SegWit-valid miners, having likely previously mined on the SegWit-invalid chain (where else could 50%+ come from?), would want a new activation date so as not to reverse the SegWit-invalid blocks that have been mined. The coins on the SegWit-invalid side could survive in this way, too. So this would further complicates trying to price such coins.


There are other factors beyond a higher price which miners should care about. The coin also needs to be liquid enough (i.e. not just a very thinly traded coin that can easily crash), have a good probability of surviving for at least 100 more blocks, which is the minimum before newly mined coins are allowed to be spent, among other things.
A UASF over a relatively benign and non-fundamental change such as SegWit would set a bad precedent, which could be followed by a UASF proposal for something which is completely unacceptable to miners. Then miners may not come, no matter what the market signals.
All those things will make both miners and users very averse of anything which is likely or certain to split the network (including UASF).

YOU got it wrong. A new rule for rejecting blocks would be a soft fork, not a hard fork. When you analyze it some, it turns out it is actually an important strategy for the non-SegWit side which further exposes the recklessness of the UASF scheme (see the last 2 paragraphs here: 


It was pointed out to me that this new UASF proposal (let's call it UASF2) doesn't even need such a splitting transaction included in a block (see this comment  The split happens automatically, guaranteed, because of this.
But even the initial trollposal, UASF1, is trivially gamed. There are mining pools which validate and include in blocks non-standard transactions submitted directly to them. If such a pool or miner is on the non-SegWit side anyone could cause it to mine the block which initiates the split. I find it funny that you would attribute malice to automatic and valid behavior such as this and say "malicious blocks".




That would be point (1). If a node doesn't recognize SegWit format transactions it can't validate them, so if they can't accept them all either, the only option left is to reject them all. But I see that you are OK with introducing the risk of what is expected to be the majority of hashpower splitting away from your preferred side into a separate coin, so I guess you are also OK with a certainty of it happening.

I look at your questions as rhetorical. It looks like you well understand all there is to UASF as of now. There is nothing on the question of measuring "economic majority"; it is the contentious fork (now someone will correct you that it is a soft fork, not a hard for, but that doesn't help it); certain people are actively trying to prompt a totally unnecessary and detrimental split of the network.
@_date: 2017-03-30 18:31:58










Your point 3) won't work in this way, because the non-UASF chain would have some blocks, between the time UASF activates and the time of BIP9 activation, which would be invalid to the UASF side, so the whole chain after that can't be accepted by them.
But non-UASF miners have a strategy which has the outcome of your point 3), while at the same time preventing the outcome of 2). Read some old comments which explain this:

Both the "economic majority", however you measure it, and the "economic minority" coins could be traded on markets. Then both sides' blocks could be valid, only on different chains, for different coins. So the miner could go short about 12.5 original (non-SegWit) coins, e.g. on a futures market and cover after they find the splitting block.
It has to be more like an "economic unanimity" for there to be only one Bitcoin on the markets. I'm pretty sure you don't have even an economic majority (any way you define it), let alone economic unanimity supporting a *user-activated* SegWit (which is a totally different thing from support for Core's SegWit).
@_date: 2017-03-14 22:22:25
If those features are the priority, and not the increase of transaction throughput, then we could try to get SegWit-lite first. This is how I call a proposal which is identical to SegWit, but which retains a 1MB limit over the whole block data. This would alleviate any concerns miners may have about larger blocks. It should be a pretty uncontroversial proposal, which I think would get the support from the vast majority of miners very quickly. We could always try to increase the effective block size limit through a separate soft fork.
@_date: 2017-02-22 16:48:17


The process that is currently organically taking place is not centralized. There are altcoins, hard-fork ideas and proposals, soft fork ideas and proposals, etc. and they are all in a survival of the fittest situation under technical scrutiny, market forces and evaluation of merits and social viability. It would be valid to complain about there not being a more formal and simple process (or better yet, try to create it), but accusing one group of people of exerting central control would certainly be false.


You are saying that you want there to be something better than signalling through hash rate? Propose and implement something good, and it could be accepted by the community. But I'm saying that the hash rate threshold is important for ensuring that we don't activate a soft fork which may make us lose too many miners, so I think it is a good idea to keep it as a necessary condition, even if we added some other conditions for activating a fork. Bitcoin's security and censorship resistance heavily depend on the miners, so I think we should listen carefully if even a relatively small portion of them tells us not to proceed with a fork yet.

So this Cryptsy guy is talking about secretly going into fractional reserve mode (fraud) **17 and a half months ago** (2014-07-29) like it's a standard industry procedure. And wasn't this exactly what happened with MtGox in June 2011? Only then the loss wasn't kept secret, but as far as we now know they never recovered 100% reserves, or did they?
So it looks like certain bitcoin businesses seem to suffer from a cargo cult mentality with regards to the fractional reserve phenomenon which appears to be working more or less 'OK' in the traditional financial systems, which however are backstopped by central banks (fundamental difference). And when I say "bitcoin businesses" I mean their operators, but also their customers who seem to be OK with it far too often and far too much. What are they thinking allowing fractional reserves into the cryptocurrency world?

With SegWit it's the miners' turn. Unless and until a large majority of miners signal for SegWit, I don't think the core developers need to advocate increasing the block size limit through other means.


So what if they refuse to endorse a hard fork proposal? or the Core devs as a whole certainly don't *owe* any hard fork proposal an endorsement, or any work (it's a free software project).
What I see in SegWit is good ideas and a lot of work done, and then it is left in the hands of the miners and users. For what purpose would developers advocate for a banishment of both miners and users (essentially what a hard fork does) instead? To divide the currency over something which is **not** a currency issue, but strictly a network issue? To then influence the decisions of miners and users to stand on one side of the new divide? I suspect this may be too much to ask of most.

About what I wrote about two tokens: sorry, when I wrote it I was thinking about another similar strategy (I called it anti-UASF and I described it in detail in the last two paragraphs [here]( It is similar in that it is a soft fork and that it disables SegWit, but different in that it leads to a permanent split of the chains of the two sides, with no risk of either one reorganizing the other one away.


You see, what you are saying about the Double UASF strategy (that is the name Nick ODell has given (see [here]( to the strategy described in this thread by also applies to the original UASF which would have prompted it, with the exception that UASF activates without checking if it has 51% or not. It's like threatening someone with a gun without first checking if you have ammo in it. It's aggression regardless. Someone with an actually loaded gun is likely to shoot you regardless, and won't suffer consequences for it, even if it later turned out you didn't have ammo, because you would have been the aggressor.
Double UASF changes consensus rules (what you call censor transactions) and the UASF which would have prompted it also changes consensus rules. But the outcome of Double UASF would be practically identical to the current, pre-UASF rules. The onus is on the UASF side to convince us why the current consensus rules are so bad as to warrant such an attack.
More importantly, it would be the UASF activation which would have prompted all the stale blocks and/or chain splits and thus the likely market panic. It would have been priced in by the time UASF activates. After that, the market participants would react to their preferences for consensus rules, i.e. if they value SegWit rules only a little higher than non-SegWit rules, Double UASF would drop the price only that little. So miners may or may not be prompted to switch sides by this. But what exactly the market thinks of SegWit rules is something which UASF advocates need to determine, rather than just say "we need economic majority" and then proceed with UASF without doing anything about determining it. I don't see calls for exchanges to start trading a futures contract or a CST (Chain Split Token, see Bitfinex) for UASF SegWit.
The other thing the market participants would react to after UASF is the resolution of the situation, in either direction. If miners acquiesced to the UASF and UASF went firmly over 50% it would be very positive. If after the Double UASF the other side gave up, it would also be very positive. So the miners have the incentive, most of all, not to allow such a contentious and uncertain situation to emerge, or exist for long.
In the case where the UASF side has &lt;50% the Double UASF strategy wouldn't cause any more panic than what the original UASF has already caused, but it could end the panic sooner.


Those are the same reasons we (me included) have discussed ever since the debates about increasing block sizes have been going on, such as the ones summarized as "increase in centralization pressures". But I'm not the one to say what's on each miner's mind. Those who are eager to have SegWit activated earlier should be interested in finding out those reasons. They should talk to the miners. If they don't, it's just one more wild card in the UASF gamble.


I think this is the main reason for current opposition to SegWit and that's why I've examined it in the past (e.g. [here]( and [here, also mentioning other reasons]( Here I've shown your argument about Double UASF not being profitable *due to panic* to be wrong. What remains uncertain is whether block rewards (incl. fees) would have a higher market value under UASF SegWit rules or under original/Double UASF rules.

Read it again:


Look - you can submit a valid non-standard transaction to a pool such as Eligius, and they can include it in a block, automatically:
@_date: 2017-03-04 16:19:59
It's a statement of fact, by itself. Mining the first forking block would be a small price to pay for anyone who wants to play the shitfork manipulation games (such as pump-and-dump schemes of either forkcoin) at the expense of a community which would have shown to be vulnerable to manipulation in the scenario where there is a non-negligible minority of the hashpower supporting an unsafe fork. That someone would mine the first forking block would be unsurprising. Actually, all sensible miners would drop support for the hypothetical user-activated soft fork (even if they wanted the features, in principle) immediately if they see that it would activate through the flag date and without a certain majority of hashpower. Then the support may consist of only a few confused leftover miners. Or the implementation would include an automatic withdrawal of support if under a certain hashrate threshold at the last moment. In that case the effect would be exactly identical to the current SegWit proposal (if not enough support - don't activate).
Manipulators would want to promote UASF, because, even if none of the more lucrative shitfork manipulation games become a reality, at least they could potentially screw the aforementioned leftover confused miners (if any).
@_date: 2017-03-13 16:14:18




I'll start from the premise, which in the e-mail you state like this:


I wouldn't agree that hashpower strictly follows price, and never the other ways around. Historical trends can only show correlation, not causation. There are underlying economic forces which work both ways. Yes, the value of a coin affects how hashpower is incentivized to mine it. When mining profits, in real terms, are higher on one chain, it attracts more miners. Higher real mining revenue would equate to higher mining profits if the costs are equal.
By the way, I think I now understand that this is what you mean by having an "economic majority": having the majority of all mining revenue (in real terms), among all chains. I wasn't sure what was meant by this, because others around here meant something different by this term.
So, mining revenue is higher when the market price of the coin is higher and when there are more fees. By the way, overall profits are affected downwards if, for example, a miner needs to pay for more bandwidth, or suffer a higher stale block rate on a specific chain.
But, to the point of economic forces between market price of the coin and hashpower, price can indeed also be affected by hashpower. You gave an example of price following hashpower yourself: the price discount due to reorganization risk. If hashpower went down on a non-SegWit chain, it would put downwards pressure on price due to higher reorganization risk. But there are economic forces in the same direction that would work on a UASF SegWit-valid chain, too. The risk of all high hashpower attacks (such as 51% attacks, selfish mining, etc.) goes up when there is a large chunk of hashpower which no longer mines the same chain. For example, if UASF SegWit-valid had 25% and non-SegWit had 75%, non-SegWit miners could spare about 7.5% of total (25%*30%) to do selfish mining on the UASF SegWit-valid chain, further lowering UASF SegWit's effective hashrate, while retaining about 67.5% (75%-7.5%) of all hash power for normal non-SegWit mining. The current bellicose attitude, ultimata and dangerous code wouldn't be helping non-SegWit miners refrain from such attacks. If you added together motive, means and an opportunity, it would not be very surprising to see overt attacks. So I think that this risk would be high, and so this economic force would be strong.
Considering that there are economic forces in both directions with a UASF (hashpower is affected by price but also price is affected by hashpower) it is not clear if hashpower and price would find equilibria, and what those equilibria would be.
There are further things which call into question your prediction that the non-SegWit chain would be reorganized away. Consider the strategy where the non-SegWit side initiates a proposal, let's call it "anti-UASF" which considers invalid the blocks which come from the UASF side. Such a proposal would be a soft fork. In case of the original UASF (let's call it UASF1, where only specific non-standard transactions in the SegWit format would cause a split) anti-UASF1 could consider any transaction with the SegWit OP code before normal 95% threshold activation as invalid (any transaction which cannot be verified for SegWit compatibility without running SegWit). In case of this new UASF (let's call it UASF2, where the split happens automatically through the SegWit signalling bit) anti-UASF2 could consider any SegWit block outside of the normal SegWit activation as invalid. The effect would be the same as if the UASF-side had gone the route of an incompatible hard fork from the beginning - the two sides would be cleanly split forever, and neither side could suffer a reorganization through the blocks of the other. This eliminates the reorganization risk for the non-SegWit anti-UASF side. Of course it would be desirable that an anti-UASF proposal be activated safely, such as through a high hashpower threshold. But if it ever got to that point, considering that non-SegWit nodes would consist of Bitcoin Core clients &gt;= v0.13.1 configured to opt out of SegWit signalling, and of pre-v0.13.1 clients, I think such a proposal would be favored by the vast majority of non-SegWit miners and be easily and quickly activated safely. Opting out of SegWit signalling is unlike abstaining from a vote. Those people specifically vote against SegWit, so it is likely that they really do oppose SegWit activation at that moment in time, and so they could only gain from supporting anti-UASF. And miners who run pre-v0.13.1-based clients for whatever reasons would more easily adopt a change to their node that introduces anti-UASF, than one which introduces UASF and supports SegWit. So I think that the chances for anti-UASF having &gt;50% support among non-SegWit nodes would be good.
Basically, anti-UASF eliminates the downwards pressure on the price from reorganization risk, but price is still pushed lower by low hashpower, which means that if there is a UASF activation with minority support for SegWit, and the minority remains as such after anti-UASF activation, there is a negative feedback loop for the UASF side's price and hashpower. The UASF SegWit side would diminish over time. The winning chain could later re-launch a SegWit proposal and have it activated when it is actually safe (like how Core's SegWit activation works with a threshold).
@_date: 2017-03-07 20:04:31
The small steps is a great idea. You should propose this as a soft fork and I think this would have a great chance of success. I think that miners would be happy to signal for it early, and not delay due to worrying about jumping too quickly to about 1.7MB, or potentially up to 4MB, as I think they are currently doing with SegWit.

No. The two things are to be demanded from two different entities that have been involved.
1. A customer can demand that *a bank* provides access to banking services (because otherwise the customer may go do business elsewhere - no other reason why a bank may change their mind).
2. A customer can demand that no one (specifically, *the government*) puts any restrictions on starting a new bank (outside of laws against fraud).
But then you suggest something resembling 1., but fundamentally different, like day and night:
* 3. A customer demanding that *a government* does something to make (forces them, what else?) banks provide access to banking services to them.
One should insist on 2. absolutely and on 1. only politely, as a customer to a business, if at all. Well, if the bank is acting as something other than a competitive business (in this and most other cases it certainly does), this complicates relations, so I don't know about 1. But 3. is just rude, unacceptable, evil, "careful what you wish for".

This IS a split. A hard fork for no good reason. Everyone who prefers one bitcoin instead of several should oppose this totally unnecessary hard fork.
SegWit shows how the block size can be increased through a soft fork. Why don't you create a proposal, let's call it "Double SegWit" - SegWit plus an extension block to achieve exactly the same throughput as this proposal? I know why. Some people want the coin to split into two in order to scam a lot of people in various ways. All of UASF, this one, BU, "Classic" (a deceptive name), XT have this result.

Fantasies. Same as with the ETC fork. I would personally offer to buy more of the coins backed by the hashing power (be they SegWit or non-SegWit), in such a hypothetical scenario where the vast majority of the hashing power is on one side, but that coin's price or liquidity is somehow very low. But it won't happen, because miners and users (including exchanges) aren't that stupid.

I'm not making it look that way. I recognized those facts when I said that most banks are acting as something other than competitive businesses. There is one proper way to solve this - remove *the effects* of bad legislation. Regain the freedom to compete. It will only really happen when businesses can operate 100% divorced from governments, undeterred by what government legislation says.
What do you mean by "make any bad legislation less attractive"? It sounds to me like using the banker's weapon (governments) against them. Does something make you think that a customer could win against a bank that way? And keep in mind that the governments themselves seem happy about the current arrangement. They are obviously getting something in return from these banks. I think that these banks would probably simply prevent any changes to banking legislation such as changes that force them to accept clients. If they failed to do so - OK - I guess it's not evil to harm *those* anti-competitive banks with their own weapon, but think of all banks. Some banks are, or will be, trying to be competitive and such legislative changes will negatively affect them too. Like innocent victims. That's why I said "careful what you wish" and that it's unacceptable, evil in general (because it would be unfair against some banks).

Right, as I am saying, it's something only superficially similar to the way today's banks, brokerages, etc. operate. Like in a cargo cult.
I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt and assuming they may have thought that they still had some valuable assets - that their company was still worth more than the money that was lost. That is very disputable. However, the way many of today's banks keep their books is also disputable. A bank's solvency could become even more disputable if there was a rumor that the central bank would refuse to backstop it, for example.
There are many differences between these two types of businesses, but I'm pointing out just one, which is indisputable and fundamental - the influence of the money creation authority. Hypothetically, Cryptsy could have had the ability to influence some small altcoin and cause it to issue a lot more coins, thus assuring themselves immunity from running out of that particular altcoin, but they certainly didn't have such influence in Bitcoin, Litecoin and many altcoins which didn't have any special change in issuance. Therefore, there is nothing which could be an excuse for such hubris (hiding losses and thinking they could become solvent again). If they really thought their situation is not that bad, they could have sought a solution fair to the customers: first disclosure, followed by an attempt to revive the company or else liquidate it ASAP. The fact that they didn't even feel they had to immediately disclose the loss of (presumably) custodial funds speaks very badly of their intentions.

Imagine there is an island where people do two things: farmers make food, and house-builders make houses. One day a troll came to the island and pretended to be an ordinary farmer. Nobody knows if he was evil or just stupid. He told the house-builders: I want all of you to start building only these new, fancy and very large houses by next year! Or else we farmers will stop trading our food with you and you will all starve to death! Only a few house-builders were ready to start building such houses, and the troll's ultimatum didn't help it in any way. Then the troll said: oh, and we will also try to stop you from selling any of the current type of houses! BOOOO! That should teach you!
Now, little child, what do you think happens next? I'll tell you what.
Imagine that on this island many of the farmers were stupid, and they believed and followed the troll, thinking that they would quickly get the new fancy and very large houses. The next year came, and maybe only a few more house-builders were able to start building them, but nowhere near all of them. The group of farmers which formed around the troll fulfilled their promise and stopped trading their food for the house-builders' traditional houses. But their houses were in need of repairs and replacement, and they couldn't afford much of the new houses, which were far too expensive. Then they also spent time trying to prevent other farmers from trading *their* food for the house-builders' traditional houses. That only reduced the food they produced for trade for houses. Then they spent even more time trying to prevent the house-builders from selling any of the traditional type of houses, which made them even poorer. The house-builders who wanted to be building the new houses were not able to build many of them, because there were few people able to afford them. So, many of them couldn't afford food, or had to start building the old types of houses again. The group of farmers around the troll also suffered from lack of housing, and the situation became worse and worse and many of them had to abandon their troll leader or die.
Meanwhile, in one part of the island the house-builders found a way to keep making and selling the traditional houses to the farmers who did not follow the troll. Those house-builders were sad and poorer than before, because they had fewer farmers to trade with. Those farmers too were sad and poorer than before, because the new type of houses were way more expensive than expected.
Everyone suffered for a long time, until the farmers and house-builders learned their lesson and the troll's influence diminished, and then they were back where they started, only poorer and wiser. I know this story may still be hard for you to understand, but you will understand it better when you grow up.

But then you say "Trusting your brain to not forget 12 very specific words is a lot riskier, no doubt", yet any encryption password would need to have at least 100 bits of entropy (compared to 128 bits for Electrum seeds) to be considered secure enough and I don't think that would enable it to be noticeably easier to remember. On the other hand, having a second mode of failure (losing the paper wallets) can only increase the risk of loss, however slightly, but not decrease it. You would still have the risk (however small) of, e.g. someone finding out about every single copy of your paper wallet (remember, you need to periodically go to every place and check them to make sure that they are present, undamaged and authentic) and then stealing them all at the same time and asking for ransom. If you have to remember a strong password anyway, I don't see how the physical copies add any benefit in any theft or loss scenario (scenarios in which you knowingly give your password away are not included).
Or do you think you can use a significantly easier to remember but less secure password (e.g. half as long as Electrum's) and then be sure that you can quickly find out if someone reads one of your encrypted wallets and starts bruteforcing?

The largest group of miners actually don't want any increase in block size at this moment, as can be seen from what they are signalling. They have close to 50%. The bickering among the others is about splitting the network into two versus not splitting it, and NOT about how large the blocks become.

The debate which started long ago was about increasing the block size limit ASAP versus not increasing it yet. That is a valid debate. Now BU proposes an increase and Core also proposes a limited increase. You would think that, if the essence of the debate is the same, SegWit is common ground - something the effects of which are desired by both of these groups of people. SegWit came relatively recently in the debate. Once it was implemented and tested it brought one major innovation - the ability to increase the block size limit without losing old version users and without the risk of splitting the network. This advent essentially makes hard fork block size limit increases (such as what AntPool wanted) obsolete. It turns out that the BU side and pools such as AntPool are now seemingly uninterested in the potential for larger blocks through SegWit. The rest of SegWit really doesn't have anything tangibly objectionable. Therefore we arrive at the conclusion that the BU side and some pools don't really care about larger blocks, but they want some other things that can happen through BU use. The debate has shifted. What are those other things they want? A few things come to mind, none of which are good for Bitcoin. No wonder then that they don't even state specifically what they want and why they want it, which makes debate and coming to an agreement impossible. At that point you can safely ignore their noise. That shifted debate was a short-lived one.
@_date: 2017-03-14 23:03:23
No, it is SegWit, just adds a 1MB limit to the block+witness data. In this proposal he witness data shouldn't have a different weight from the rest of the block data. It's just a simple idea I have (I'm sure others have been thinking about this too since the inception of the SegWit ideas).
@_date: 2017-03-27 02:09:06






If the current rules side (non-UASF) has &gt;50% hashpower, you are right in this, considering the recent release of a joint statement by the major exchanges on handling of the other potential Bitcoin network split (which is an actual hard fork proposal). If the UASF side happened to have &gt;50% hashpower, it would be more complicated (but then we could do a normal soft fork with a threshold in that case).
@_date: 2017-03-05 16:02:09
By unacceptable I mean some badly flawed or malicious proposal which, for example, makes their revenue very unpredictable or unfairly distributed (even without a split). Something which they cannot work with. The predetermined issuance schedule is nothing like that.


The thinking is no surprise, indeed. But the potential effects of a UASF are so bad and unpredictable that most users, and especially miners would rather have an irreconcilable, but more predictable hardfork with a forkcoin than that. And why are these two dumb things (UASF and hardforks) being promoted so widely and loudly when there are obvious and easy other things which could be proposed first (not to mention simply *waiting*), as I have mentioned before: ( To me it is obvious that the promotion of the splitting proposals is helping malicious agenda. We do know that there are people in the cryptocurrency community who like to do pump-and-dump schemes, for one thing. So I am discounting the seeming support for UASF as evidence that the economy actually wants to activate SegWit *that* urgently.

They are relying on the rules for relaying blocks (which are not consensus rules) to try to hide the blocks which are not signalling for SegWit from Bitcoin Core nodes with versions &gt;= 0.13.1. In this way they pray and hope to hide the existence of a potentially longer chain of blocks which don't have threshold support for SegWit (actually, certainly much longer at current share of non-signalling for SegWit). This, of course, puts those nodes under the risk not only of falsely believing that SegWit is safe to activate, but also of devastating long chain reorganizations, which could easily lead to loss of money for these users through double spend attacks. It is essentially a distributed Sybil attack with a nasty positive feedback loop. If those nodes are communicating mostly with UASF nodes, or other Core &gt;= v0.13.1 nodes which have already been fooled into activating SegWit through this mechanism, they will be seeing SegWit-signalling blocks most of the time. When they finally connect to a Core &gt;= v0.13.1 node which has the longest chain (containing the suppressed non-SegWit signalling blocks) and get these blocks, their node performs a reorganization to recognize the newly discovered longest chain, which could undo many blocks from the shorter chain.
Mining nodes are well connected to each other, so if a majority of the hashing power remains opposed to SegWit, their blocks are likely to continue building an orderly chain even under an intense UASF Sybil attack (many users running a UASF node). So this non-SegWit chain would be longer than the UASF chain, and from time to time it would get through to Core &gt;= v0.13.1 nodes, causing reorganizations and even deactivating SegWit (if their previous best chain was long enough to cause them to think it was properly activated). It would be a pretty nasty mess if it ever got there.
More likely, UASF nodes won't be that many, the reorganizations would be shorter, and UASF nodes would just be a nuisance.
Bottom line is, you can't really enforce a soft fork with less than 50% mining support, whatever you try (who'd a thunk).

Total bullshit. It is actually worse than a hard fork, as was explained by multiple people. It's the worst of both worlds.

Neither one is forever. Both will die off, if they ever activated. That is unless you counted reaching &gt;50% hashpower as UASF's merit, which would be wrong - it would be *miner* activation and enforcement at that point and UASF wouldn't be needed or helping in any way.

If it is a hard fork at all there are people who will expend a lot of resources just to make it a split (particularly on the markets), because apparently there are a lot of suckers who can be scammed in a variety of ways with an alternative currency. Today you can practically count on it. This is why we need to make it easy, especially for people new to Bitcoin, to understand what technical proposals have merit and how to decide what software to run and what coins to use. Scams are not a long term viable part of an economy. The whole ecosystem would be stronger, larger and more valuable in the long run if we had less of them.


Only a cunning mind will try to introduce and promote the opportunity for a split to make a lot of money out of it. Many "bigblockers" have successfully been diverted from the community for several years now. "Smallblockers" are now apparently a target of similar warmongering tactics. The core of the community will stay together and a few marginal suckers will get separated and scammed, until the suckers diminish in numbers and wealth.
Even without a split of the currency (i.e. it not being traded on exchanges) some of the proposals can be used to scam miners into mining a non-viable fork in order to waste their hash power, for the benefit of their competitors.
@_date: 2017-03-13 01:07:46
Thanks for quoting and linking to this explanation. I understood this addition to the previous UASF proposal after I read this.
As I explained to the effect of this is to simply obviate the need for a miner to mine a block with a certain kind of transaction in order to initiate the split of the network (and thus enable all the lucrative manipulation opportunities that follow from that).

They would be responding exactly in kind to what the other group of users and/or miners would have done in that scenario. They'd propose a new soft fork, only this time they'd likely make it *safe* by putting some actual activation threshold, and activate and enforce it by hashpower, like all normal soft forks before. It's not any harder than UASF becoming a reality with &gt;50% hashpower opposing it.


It's the logical response. They'd do it for whatever reasons they would have had to oppose SegWit. They could even disable only the things which they don't like in SegWit, e.g. they could allow SegWit transactions, but enforce a 1MB total limit.


You are assuming that a slightly larger block size limit blockchain is significantly more valuable (enough to offset whatever the difference in fee revenue for miners is) on the market. Yet I don't see anything of substance from UASF advocates on the topic of establishing a market price for the two tokens. In the proposal there's only the hope that exchanges suppress market liquidity, by not trading and instead completely ignoring the original chain, which is sheer lunacy. We already know that a large portion of exchanges aren't that stupid and careless of their own and their clients' money.
Without a price signal miners have no reason to take UASF seriously and consider acquiescing to it.
@_date: 2017-03-15 09:59:22
Because one of the things included in the SegWit implementation is allowing more transactions. More transactions means miners need a better internet connection and better hardware. It also affects how much in fees they get (both the number of fees and the size of each fee). Total fees may go lower or higher.
Miners are in no hurry, but they will eventually want to jump on the SegWit train, because:
1. If users were too unhappy because of no SegWit and left Bitcoin, miners would get less money. Miners would want to prevent that. Miners would then activate SegWit.
2. If the demand for transactions grows over a certain point, total fees would be higher with SegWit. Miners would want that, so then they would activate SegWit.
Right now, we are not in 1. and not in 2. We are somewhere in the middle, so miners wait.

@_date: 2017-03-13 00:14:33
Oh, I see.
Now that I read the e-mail that someone linked to in a comment I find this thing which I didn't get from the BIP-candidate linked by OP:


So the idea is to remove the need for a miner to mine such a transactions in order to split the network. It just splits right away, automatically at activation. You don't think you need those miners, even if they hold about three quarters of the hash rate (last time I checked)?


There are miners who mine non-standard transactions, and listen for such.


Firstly, it wouldn't be a total loss if the coin on that fork of the chain is traded on a market, and secondly, it wouldn't be loss at all if it is *hedged* on such a market. Beyond that, the amount of market and mining manipulation that opens up can probably make that miner (with first hand, early information, no less!) orders of magnitude more bitcoins in profit, unless everyone has already accurately priced in all the manipulation by that point, which would mean lower BTC price and thus lower revenues in real terms for all miners. But if everyone on the market knew exactly what was going to happen, most miners would probably know it too, and wouldn't go ahead in the first place. So there would be profits to be made on the market, in various mining strategies, or both, in a scenario where there are any miners dumb enough to mine a user-activated SegWit chain.
But that doesn't matter, because now even this insignificant cost for the manipulators is removed.

That is why some businesses would want to declare upfront, before a contract is entered into, (maybe in the written contract itself, if there is one) any conditions about the repayment. This is especially important for any business that lets customers owe them for long periods of time. A smart businesses should place some conditions on legal tender repayments and that can somewhat neutralize the bad effects of legal tender laws.
So if, for example, a restaurant placed this "dollars not accepted here" prominently displayed at every entrance then customers wouldn't be able to invoke legal tender laws when they have to pay their bills, because the customers would be considered to have accepted the terms written on the sign when entering, even though they are essentially in debt from the time they're served.

It would be exactly as "risky" (if you also call "risky" leaving your wallet unattended in a busy public place). First of all, Satoshi 0.13.1 nodes are **not** nodes running this idiotic or malicious (who knows which one? who knows the intent?) code. That would be separate software which is yet to be run by anyone.
But more importantly, if anyone did run it, those people who want to have the network split **will** trivially make it split. They will connect directly to many mining nodes and send them a transaction which is invalid on SegWit consensus rules, but valid on the pre-SegWit activation consensus rules, wait for them to include it in a block, or failing that, mine it themselves, and then the network splits. The people running the idiotic/malicious UASF client would likely lose the most out of the split, whereas the Bitcoin community losing those UASF-using fools to a shitcoin or to bankruptcy would arguably not be a loss at all.

I think it will "appease" them not because regulators care about how much a bitcoin is worth, but because they have some other reasons to want to see the effects of a change of the main denomination in Bitcoin. I think they want to conscript (force them to do an undesirable job) the exchanges to conduct this experiment in the Bitcoin community. It was probably the regulators who gave the idea to BTCC.
Why would they want to see the effects of this? I don't know. The first idea that comes my to mind is that the results from such an experiment are to be presented to the PBoC (Communist China's central bank), to be used as an argument for or against a redenomination (whether a split or a reverse split) of their fiat currency CNY. Their currency isn't in desperate need for a redenomination (currently one dollar for 6.86CNY) but another communist regime - the Soviet Union did do redenominations due to inflation of one-for-10 multiple times, rather than doing less frequent big redenominations (which is generally a more common type of redenomination), so maybe they think their time for a redenomination is near.

This use of the word had largely disappeared when the unit of information was named, so this was not such an egregious misappropriation, unlike OP's suggestion. There was also not much room for confusion between the old monetary unit and the unit of information at the time. Today, there are bits all around bitcoin, in the length of private keys (256 bits), their security (128 bits), hash function security (160 bits, 256 bits), version bits, bits in data structures, there are bits all around in related contexts. They all refer to the unit of information. You don't want to have to expand on what you mean by "a 256-bit key", and you certainly don't ever want to be owed "bits" (well, Mt.

I don't think there are many miners who have anything against fixing malleability or most of the other effects of SegWit. Of all the aspects of the current SegWit proposal I think the most obvious thing which may be deterring some miners from signalling support is the increase of the effective block size from about 1MB to about 1.7MB or up to potentially 4MB. The smaller miners and the bandwidth and latency limited miners in particular have more at risk from any increase in effective block size than anyone else.
This is my interpretation as a non-miner of the current level of signalling for SegWit. I'm not aware of an actual miner expressing publicly and explicitly such an opinion (that they specifically don't want the block size to increase even to ~1.7MB yet). Maybe they are not really trying to make their opinion on this heard and understood. Maybe they should, seeing that there are people like you and me who are curious to know/confirm this.
Another way to confirm this is to launch a new soft fork proposal of SegWit, but without the increase in bandwidth requirement (i.e. keep a 1MB block size limit). Call it SegWit Lite. I think this would get to the support threshold very quickly. Similarly, you could have a soft fork proposal for, say 4MB blocks. I could order what I think would be the current levels of support for different proposals like this (from highest support to lowest):
* SegWit Lite (1MB)
* SegWit (~1.7MB up to 4MB)
* SegWit I-just-made-this-up-to-illustrate-my-point (fixed 4MB limit, with equal weight for all data)
* Soft fork 4MB block size limit
* Hard fork 4MB block size limit

You are right in theory. However, in practice, that wouldn't have even mattered. Both UASF proposals, BIP148 and BIP149, were conceived, specified and coded in a way that was so badly vulnerable that it would have been a total disaster for its users if it ever came to a chain split (i.e. what UASF really does if left alone). See this: 
The most lucrative scenario for the miners was for there to be a UASF chain with a lot of economic activity on it, because if those users ever got to using SegWit on the UASF chain, they would have **lost all BTC on the non-UASF chain** and **killed mining on the UASF chain** due to the opportunity cost from mining on the non-UASF chain where all SegWit transactions could be pocketed by the miners. All at once. So much for the hypothetical "Economic Majority" on their side if this had happened. And this is what the UASF advocates really worked towards.

You can still use "3" and no decimal places, with "millionth" or "micro" being implied. And for the rare larger amounts you can say the full "300 bitcoins", which is easy and short. My point is that it's better to stay away from saying the ambiguous word "bits" in this context, when we already have the option to just say the amount only, which is the ultimate in brevity, and when we want to be a little more specific, "3 micros" or even "3 millionths" is still good enough (easy and short). And when we want to be more specific still (e.g. in a contract, where clarity is very important and convenience of writing it is very unimportant), the full "3 micro bitcoins", or "3µBTC", or even "3 millionths of a bitcoin" give you the ultimate clarity through the reference to the original, and universally recognized unit "BTC", or "bitcoins". (I'm OK with the µBTC unit becoming the more commonly used and preferred one, but I'm not OK with the name "bits" which some push for.)
On the other hand, if you were to say "3 bits" and someone asked something like "3 bits of what?", how would you clarify? That suggested name does not give you a reference to the original unit. Worse still, it gives a misleading hint, in that "bit" sounds like it could be an abbreviation of "bitcoin". Terrible for any formal use. And, as I think we can agree, in informal use we could simply say just the amount.

It turns out she doesn't actually need the tooth itself (surprise)! She only needs a proof of it falling off, which can be engineered into digital form. A good picture showing the tooth and where it fell off of could show:
* the fact that a tooth has fallen off;
* exact classification of the tooth which has fallen off;
* identity of the person;
The Tooth Fairy, naturally, can keep track of identities and state of the teeth universally, and she doesn't even need a blockchain for that. So, even in cases where the tooth itself is lost, a picture showing its absence might in the future rid children of the fear of losing their due Tooth Fairy money (TFM). Making the whole protocol secure against Tooth Fairy fraud (TFF) is not a trivial task though.

Not changing the address won't save you from high fees if you receive very small amounts and send much larger amounts. The way a typical transaction is constructed is, you have one or more inputs, where each input corresponds to a specific transaction's output that you've received, and not just to an address. So you'd have multiple inputs, even if they all come from the same address. Each input takes space, and I don't know if there are any space savings at all if multiple inputs come from the same address.

One more cursory check on Wikipedia shows that John Tukey and Claude Shannon (Americans) came up with the name for the unit of information and used it formally in 1947-1948, long after the monetary unit had disappeared from circulation in America both as a coin, and in the language (18-19th century).

One thing such arguments can be interesting for is not for the arguments' sake, but for their value as evidence which is to be used to judge the character of people and organizations.
Like when you see that some people seemingly support a hard fork max block size increase but refuse to support a soft fork max block size increase (e.g. SegWit, with no real objections to the rest of what SegWit does) it becomes very obvious that their goal is really not about block size, but something related to the forking mechanism. Then denying that only adds evidence of dishonesty. I'm not speaking of the positions of specific individuals here though.

This is terrible advice, almost as bad as giving away your whole seed to each of those parties. If someone has 2/3 of the length of a 128-bit key or seed there's only about 42.666 bits left to brute-force, which should be doable cheaply and in little time, perhaps hours (depending on algorithm). So a thief only really needs to get the information kept by one of the parties. And having multiple parties store such information increases the probability of theft exponentially.

Well, voting is concluded immediately at 750/1000 and then there's a two week (~2000 blocks) grace period. The NotXT nodes may decide to stop voting for XT when the 750/1000 threshold is reached, just to fuck with the perceptions of those who are looking for where the majority is, or are just anxious about the fork. Then, over the grace period you may see something like 499/1000 (but the software doesn't take any consideration of these votes as far as I know). Unless you have a large miner or a landslide of many small miners all switching around the 75% mark you would have the vote only touch 75% and then plummet to &lt;50%. Then many XT supporters will rightfully be anxious and will have to decide what to do. Then someone, perhaps even someone who was using NotXT, mines the first &gt;1MB block just to initiate the fork and it's action time.
Practically all miners know that there can be voting for one while doing the other. It will probably be very hard for all participants to know what each side's strength really is.


It can indeed be patched away - but those are extra actions by devs and miners (by the way, it would practically make it official that XT is an altcoin). And it can be done only after some time has passed (at a minimum a dozen blocks, perhaps more), otherwise it's controversial to do that. So there will likely be an opportunity for many short length reorgs that make many &gt;1MB blocks stale. My point is that if there are conviction supporters for both chains who keep both chains alive then those on the XT chain will lose some blocks, while those on the Bitcoin Core chain will not. It may just add that little loss that bankrupts a marginal XT miner, or forces him to switch to a different mining strategy or chain - anything that keeps him afloat. The relative market value of the two coins would be more important in that case though.

Well then I wouldn't be so sure about the length of the period, especially considering that the threshold is a single miner deciding to mine the first larger than 1MB block. Whether all major exchanges/payment processors support XT or even whether 75+ percent of the miners *actually* support XT, in deeds (mining over &gt;1MB blocks), and not only in words (voting) might well turn out to be a surprisingly tough thing to assess. There may well be deception.
There could be malicious players who have an incentive to vote in favor of XT but then to actually support the 1MB side in order to create a contentious fork. That could result in a long race and create opportunities for various kinds of profitable malicious activities. Suppose you have a situation with about 50% of mining power being controlled by real supporters of larger than 1MB blocks, about 25% - by supporters of 1MB blocks and about 25% by malicious actors. Those 25% malicious actors could *vote* for XT to help initiate a fork and then decide to support the 1MB side. A mere 25% could cause many kinds of nasty stuff and they don't even need to be an organized group at all (unlike e.g. selfish mining attacks).

I've [suggested some cases when certain kinds of miners would have an incentive to do this]( It's even worse than that. A mere unorganized  class of miners collectively controlling about 18% of hashing power (after helping initiate a fork over the course of a couple of years or so) could send a ~50% of true XT supporters mining for naught, thus roughly doubling their effective long term income a la selfish mining. You see, the XT chain will be considered invalid by the Bitcoin Core nodes, but the Bitcoin Core chain will be considered valid by the XT nodes. So, when the Bitcoin Core chain catches up (and mathematically it certainly will, it's a matter of time) the XT fork becomes stale and is discarded by XT nodes (under normal protocol). It gets worse. Even if the true XT miners actually hold more than a majority, e.g. 55%, the minority will still catch up from time to time, making the XT fork stale! So that's a second possible motive - potentially get more than double the bitcoins from the same hashing power.

From a cursory look I don't see Dave's simulations simulating latency. The presentation slides show the reduction in *variance*, which is one factor affecting pool choice.

I can intuitively see how this is the case.
It's one thing to have a reduced income *variance*, it's entirely different to have a different *expected income*. You can mitigate variance, but you can't mitigate reduced expected income. Even pools shouldn't allow you to do that.

Given that the purpose is only to prove being solvent and nothing more, I think many companies could skip some assets and still have enough provable assets to cover all liabilities.

Also, for some internet companies it is feasible to have very few or no assets besides cash.

This calculation does miss the fact that ECDSA only provides 128 bits of security for 256-bit keys. So it should consider 2^128 and not 2^256. The amount of energy required becomes less than astronomical.
It ~~also~~ assumes a brute force attack. We are talking about a significant improvement in memory technology, therefore it is worth reconsidering the feasibility of algorithms based on a [time-memory tradeoff]( ~~So, when calculating the time an attack could take we should consider something less than linear to that 2^128.~~ Exactly how much closer we are to an attack becoming feasible I don't know, but numbers like 1000x or even 10x are nothing to scoff at.
Edit: actually, I just learned that the reason ECDSA keys are considered to have a level of security half the key size is precisely the time-memory tradeoff algorithms which need O(sqrt(n)) steps (so, sqrt(2^256
)=2^128 in this case, thus 128-bit security).

To put it in perspective: [yearly electricity consumption in Mongolia as of 2010 ≈ 1.1x10^(16) J](
As I said, less than astronomical. It's also well within what we produce, but I'm not going to try to make more realistic estimates. I know it won't look so scary.
But there needs to be someone doing the math from time to time in order to get a sense where we are at now.

I give you respect for taking the time to write this, but we both understand bandwidth and latency the same way. I'll leave throughput aside, as it is used with different meanings.
1MB blocks at 1 minute don't have a lower bandwidth requirement than 10MB blocks at 10 minutes. See [this exchange with luke-jr](






So, with 1 minute intervals you would only tolerate about 3 seconds of delay between the block being created and you receiving it. So bandwidth requirement stays about the same if we ignore the effects of latency. The protocol overhead (block headers and lower level stuff) increases bandwidth requirements a tiny bit in the case of 1 minute intervals. Now if we do take into account the effects of latency things get even worse for the short interval case.

Yeah, there is some confusion coming from the fact that "proof of solvency" is merely a fancy term used to describe a particular type of technical solution that *can* be used for the purposes of proving solvency under some limited circumstances. But it has to be done right, and even then there will be some limitations and conditions. It could achieve that if the entity is not able to have any secret liabilities, (e.g. being legally restricted) and it has enough cryptocurrency or cryptoassets to cover all the liabilities. Exchanges, for example, generally can't meet the second condition, since their fiat currency liabilities are so large compared to their own cryptocurrency reserves, while fiat assets are trickier to prove. Maybe someone comes up with a good way to prove ownership or custody for traditional assets.
There has to be a culture (and a protocol) of *everyone* demanding to see what they're owed included on a "proof of solvency" report, and not just account holders. Deposit into an account? Buy a bond? Order a product? Demand to see the proof, or else scream and shout and cease all business with them. I think we'll get there one day.
@_date: 2015-07-02 16:03:22
That's why I think a proof of solvency must be continuous, or to be repeated at an interval of no more than a day. Then it should also be combined with a specific procedure of what to do in case of insolvency (a bankruptcy procedure). For example, I think a reasonable procedure for a company would be to promise that in case of insolvency operations are halted immediately (i.e. withdrawals stop automatically at the moment insolvency is determined and announced), then there is a pre-specified period of time in which to try to find a solution (e.g. find someone to buy the company) after which it is bankruptcy and liquidation time.
The internet needs bankruptcy law.

If XT does completely supersede the current Bitcoin, then people would probably gradually start calling it simply Bitcoin, bitcoin, the blockchain, etc., except when referring to things and amounts of the period before the transition was complete. During a period of transition or coexistence during an unsuccessful challenge people would have to use different names to distinguish them. If you said "I'd sell it to you for a bitcoin" you would immediately be asked "original or XT" (or whatever distinguishable names).

I think the "correct" way to implement SPV mining is that they should have a (only slightly modified?) bitcoind which does the block validation and calls the SPV mining software with the result of that validation so that in case the block is invalid the mining can resume from a different header (highest known header that is not known to be in an invalid chain). So, if instead of just relying on what bitcoind says are valid blocks they get a call from bitcoind *in case of an invalid block* then they wouldn't risk producing stale blocks due to bitcoind being behind, if that is what you mean. Is that right? I think this is the kind of algorithm Tier Nolan has in mind too.
It looks like these pools did not implement such a check, but another explanation is that they did implement it but their bitcoind instance for validation purposes was an old version, while they simply set their own software to produce blocks marked as version 3. Both explanations produce the same result, don't they?

You guys have been posting on the topic for days but the things you say totally ignore the Double UASF strategy ([weeks old idea]( Even my anti-UASF idea (see last two paragraphs [here]( protects from reorganizations. Non-SegWit signalling miners have no reason to abandon their work. If they later decided that they wanted SegWit, they'd activate it on their own chain, not switch to another chain.
@_date: 2017-04-03 07:24:32


If such people don't control at least 50% of the hash power they can't control the rules. They could do other things though, such as try to split the network and currency (which is what UASF can do).


If the blocksize increase is uncontroversial, then at least a extension block soft fork (to, say, 2-4MB) would pass, and make some people happier.


I'm not at all convinced that there are even 10% of miners who intentionally try to do this. How could you be convinced of it?
And if what you say is true, then there's absolutely nothing to deter them from engaging in the Double UASF strategy and thus disabling SegWit after a UASF. There's no way to force a majority of hash power to enforce and allow SegWit if they don't want to or need to. So, in case there is a majority of hostile miners, UASF has no use against them (however, counterintuitively, it could be an effective weapon in the hands of *miners* against other miners and/or users).

There's some of that in avoiding BU supporting businesses, particularly ones which don't hold customer funds or make payments to customers. But there's also the basic need to preserve one's money and get paid in an acceptable way and form. This applies to all businesses which have any kind of customer liabilities denominated in BTC. You'd rather not keep any bitcoins with, or rely on BTC income from a business which may not respect the blockchain and coin which you want when a fork occurs.
If you don't know what happens in real world scenario like that, see what happened with the exchanges during the ETH and ETC (Ethereum Classic) fork fiasco.
@_date: 2017-04-03 00:05:28


You mean... UASF supporters would be willing to endure additional 2 and a half months of *even higher fees than before*, rather than what... wait a few weeks or months (at current transaction throughput) for enough miners to start signalling for a normal soft fork when they want it?
@_date: 2017-04-02 04:08:35
That is true. Both miners and users matter.
@_date: 2017-04-03 01:00:13


For that we don't need the larger transaction throughput (effectively larger blocks) of SegWit, just the malleability fix and the rest of the improvements. We could propose "SegWit Lite" which applies the current 1MB limit for the block + witness data and I think enough miners (a supermajority of hash power) would get behind it extremely fast, because it doesn't change block size. It would be very uncontroversial. We don't have to wait for years, or even for the current SegWit signalling period to expire. SegWit Lite would be easy to write and signalling could start soon.
Meanwhile, the transaction throughput could increase independently through a separate soft fork, such as the original SegWit, or through an extension blocks implementation.
The idea is that smaller, separate proposals are more likely to pass and be activated.
@_date: 2017-04-04 03:32:03


I don't think it is even politically practical. I think miners wouldn't support this and it wouldn't go anywhere.

Then why not add a &gt;50% hashpower activation threshold to UASF?


I use Bitcoin and I wouldn't interpret it thus, much less agree with such talk. Double UASF would enforce practically the same rules as are now in force, so what could be malicious about that?


That is exactly what I'm illustrating... about *UASF*s. *USAF*s are a bad idea too, but that's another topic ;)


I'm not making a threat. UASF is a threat which rings hollow, because it doesn't try to get, or even check for, miner hashpower nor economic majority support. Double UASF would be a defensive weapon, a second strike weapon, which may only become active if it also has what it takes to succeed - hashpower majority support (determined through signalling). A Double UASF can allow a normal threshold-based SegWit activation to occur at a later time, and I think this would be the likely outcome. Miners would want SegWit no later than they see that it would increase their revenue. It will happen when the demand for transactions increases to the point where the larger quantity of transactions with SegWit yields more in total fees.

@_date: 2017-04-04 11:55:40
The anyone-can-spend output becomes a no-one-can-spend until a later, normal activation through the 95% threshold. That's a tightening of the rules, not a loosening.
The Double UASF could be activated even before the UASF flag date, before UASF nodes even start trying to block non-signalling blocks.
Which soft fork can succeed? It's all about majority of hashpower.

In this I see an endorsement of BIP148 at least as a viable software that you think it is OK to advertise to Bitcoin users to run in place of their client. Not only endorsement of the software, but also of the claims and statements in the BIP, the author's mails, perhaps the FAQ and other documents.
Another comment: 


You talk about the requirement for economic majority support in the same way BIP148's author talks, but there are no specifics anywhere to be seen, other than the author seemingly promising to unilaterally decide to withdraw the proposal or not, even after the software has been distributed (another case of lack of coordination in itself). But then saying "the method works", as if there is a complete method, is concerning. It is akin to saying that *a perpetual motion machine works, because conceptually it requires no net energy input*. It does not mean that a perpetual motion machine can exist in the real world. Why would you be talking about a BIP148 method as if it is known and has been satisfactorily described? It is not an explicit endorsement, but herein I see circumstantial evidence that you believe BIP148 to be valid, compatible with the fundamental principles of Bitcoin and not incomplete at best.
BIP8 is not meaningfully better than BIP148's mechanism, as it retains the cost/risk of a mere one block being mined by anyone who wishes to split the chain. This is insignificant, relative to potential pay-offs from intentionally causing a split. Those opposing a soft fork which is being activated through BIP8 would still have the Double-UASF and Anti-UASF strategies at their disposal to neutralize risks coming from the BIP8 side. BIP8 has the same utter absence of consideration for miner signalling or even an attempt to quantify or specify user support requirement as BIP148.
Since you mention it in the context of SegWit, I assume you support a BIP8 activation for SegWit, correct?
@_date: 2017-04-24 06:50:22


I now see an enormously larger amount of evidence of what you've said here two months ago. However, my perspective differs from yours in that I'm inclined to believe that the main motive is not "to take Bitcoin in a direction that "they" feel is correct"; that there is a large group of marketers who don't care much about the direction. Instead, I think that there is a large ongoing marketing campaign for which the motive is simply money, in any form, gained without respect for basic morals, such as honesty. I'm talking about the recent campaign around BIP148 (a potential SegWit minority fork which could easily split the currency). As to how money could be made out of this - just look at the large altcoin and forkcoin scene and you will find 1001 ways to scam people. Considering that so many people can make so much money in in so many ways, conspiracy is not even strictly necessary - such a movement could grow seeming support from unlikely parties and in unlikely forms. And it is not easy to distinguish between original confused people, scammers and their shills and their victims. So I wouldn't accuse anyone, but just look at these websites promoting SegWit:
 :
* Alex B. - — Community Growth  has personally expressed support for BIP148 multiple times;
* Jameson Lopp and Ben Davenport work for bitgo.com and have expressed support for BIP148, at least personally (concerning behavior, considering how much bitcoins the company has responsibilities for);
* Francis Pouliot - CEO of Satoshi Portal and Director of the Bitcoin Embassy, all in support of BIP148;
* Charlie Lee - Litecoin creator and has expressed support for BIP148 on Bitcoin multiple times;
* "SegWit Resources" - has posted the FAQ from uasf.co
So all editors and most writers there are involved with it. Same with  :
* Segwit.co created by Samourai Bitcoin Wallet - in support of BIP148.
Also look here on and on twitter. You'll see a lot of marketing, strongly reminiscent of the hard fork proposals.
There could perhaps be a legitimate way to try to activate SegWit with a smaller majority of miners and by actually trying to *measure* user demand (like on a market) for SegWit *before* mainnet-wide activation, but BIP148 is clearly a completely different kind of thing.

With the current ~70% they have (not including pro-SegWit UASF-opposing miners, which are probably also a substantial percentage) they could not only refuse SegWit *transactions* but also refuse whole SegWit *blocks* from other miners. This would be a new soft fork, described by Nick ODell who called it Double UASF ( With this SegWit remains totally inactive, as it is today. Back to square one.

Trying to learn is great for you and for others, but please try to be more responsible towards people who are new to the discussion, by being more careful, especially in what you advocate.
You have to consider the strategies which miners could employ, such as Double UASF.
Edit: to add:
It's understandable if you don't get all the problems with UASF at first - it's like al minefield. But think of first principles first:
* Can a minority of hashpower really force the majority to enforce changes?
* Can anyone prevent one coin's existence on the markets, in favor of another?
@_date: 2017-04-04 03:13:33
I don't buy your premise:


But if it was true, then such miners would very likely implement and follow the [Double UASF]( strategy and thus **disable SegWit**. They'd have every reason to do it and absolutely nothing to deter them, and they'd have everything they need to succeed. UASF would have achieved absolutely nothing (except, perhaps ironically, potentially delaying normal SegWit activation).

Kudos for plainly admitting that it is the intention to split the network and currency with UASF.


The Double UASF strategy turns the tables and puts UASF blocks at risk of being reorganized away. If the UASF side has &lt;50% hashpower they can never get anything, but the rest of the miners can (and I think will) activate SegWit with a hashpower majority at a later point in time (still disregarding any blocks UASF mined previously). By the way, if you thought about it you could see that UASF could *delay* normal SegWit activation, in several ways.

@_date: 2017-04-03 14:38:35
Simply mining under current rules (delay SegWit) is not a matter of honesty or dishonesty.
In an actual matter of honesty and dishonesty you'd be able to tell the dishonest blocks from the honest, and thus follow the honest block chain. example case would be a hard fork, so in that case it's automatic.
@_date: 2017-04-01 10:15:03
There are at least theoretical ways to increase effective block size like that via a soft fork, such as the extension block ideas. SegWit also shows a way, although the throughput (effective block size) depends on the portion of witness data in transactions.
I put this in the list just to express that I think that miners would prefer a change to happen through a soft fork, rather than a hard fork (assuming no major caveats for the soft fork implementation, compared to the hard fork implementation) and also that I think that most miners value and even desire the malleability fix (and other SegWit benefits unrelated to throughput) and are not indifferent to it, but their desire to delay increasing throughput seems to be stronger.

@_date: 2018-03-26 18:51:43


What you are saying here is absolutely false. Miners have no reason to care about what some small sect of users want to consider invalid blocks for themselves. We've seen the wave of forkcoins and scamcoins which was sparked by the BIP148/BIP149 UASF. Anyone has the ability to decide to consider some blocks invalid for oneself and create a forkcoin that way. People can't care about every such pathetic project. And indeed they don't *need* to.
Miners were under no risk from BIP148, BIP149, or any UASF in general. Even if they had done nothing they would have most likely (Probability&gt;&gt;99%, as could be seen from the hashpower distribution) not lost even a single block reward. Or they could have actively countered it: they could do invalidateblock, Double-UASF, anti-UASF, or why not even announce the advent of overt ASICBoost (something which is only now being promoted by the apostles of UASF, how curious!), thus nullifying the false premise for the UASF.
Miners simply *wanted* SegWit because they benefit from it too, and this is ultimately why they activated it.
@_date: 2018-03-27 01:13:28


Or just do the obvious and activate SegWit on the original Bitcoin blockchain, just later in time. So, miners get both SegWit and keep their mining rewards, and users get a functioning blockchain with miners working on it and eventually SegWit. How could you argue that miners would choose to do something more stupid than the obvious, default course of action, or that users would be fine with a large reorganization?


And that means that miners could do a Double-UASF at any time to counter and disable any UASF that they don't like. So there is no valid motivation to do any UASF. Miner signalling works fine. You can't successfully activate a soft fork without the hashpower majority anyway. There's no free lunch.

That would seem to contradict what you said above. If anything, it would be better if we could *add* a second signalling mechanism, while miner signalling supermajority MUST remain a necessary condition for activation. Removing it would simply mean introducing a chain split vulnerability into the software. There is no legitimate reason to do that for an upgrade.

This historical revisionism was entirely predictable from the thorough dishonesty of the UASF trollposal from the start.

@_date: 2018-03-27 12:28:32


Yes, you are:


This is so absurdly wrong. This is the stupid idea of miners switching to a minority chain, rather than just continuing the same chain and activating the same soft fork there. You were trying to use this as an argument somehow. Dropping this argument, the claim remains that a minority chain would just die or, at most, turn into a forkcoin, but NOT in any way cause miners and users to abandon the longer original chain.






Essentially the UASF idea was asking for a chainsplit and a large reorganization. The users on the majority hashpower chain certainly wouldn't be happy with it. I'm talking about those users (and since BIP148 and BIP149 had no replay protection to ease the splitting of coins, that would be all users by default). And so they wouldn't have any of it. It's as simple as that. Simply not do something stupid.
I do remember a lot of demagoguery posts.


Decisions were never centralized to just one group of people or just one way of making them. Ultimately decisions needs to have the agreement of both users and miners, the latter one being easily measured through miner signalling.






No, in a [Double-UASF]( all the miners technically adhere to the UASF rule set, but the majority of them (those who activated the Double-UASF) also adhere to a stricter rule set, which essentially disables the functionality that the UASF is trying to make available for use. It prevents a chain split. It seems like you are still talking about a chain split scenario here (which I wouldn't call "*successfully* activate a soft fork"). If you really want to fork off (I don't recommend it) and be able to use whatever functionality you want to enable then a UASF doesn't help. You'd have a better chance by doing a hard fork and having replay protection (BIP148 and BIP149 didn't have any) and then competing as a forkcoin (good luck). Then the miners can't block it so easily. A Dobule-UASF for them is easy, next to no risk and next to no cost (just deploying a few lines of code).

All those things are shared between BIP148/BIP149 and the big-block HF projects that preceded the UAHF. When someone is giving damaging financial or other advice in bad faith it is not "just shitty rhetoric". It is actually criminal.
Then you mentioned how UAHF was planned (it was never actually released in this form, unlike BIP148, was it?) to create a forkcoin with the irresponsible lure of letting people enrich themselves with UAHF coins at the expense of other potential UAHF users. But what a forkcoin does within its own blockchain is entirely up to their designers and users, however irresponsible, as long as it does not affect others. I'm calling this plan a plan irresponsible towards property within that same new currency, which could easily be fixed (the way it was fixed) and you are calling it "letting people pretend to steal".
Then I went on to explain how the same thing (irresponsibility towards property) and more can be said of BIP148/BIP149. I mentioned how BIP148/BIP149 promoters tried to lure miners, promising them the ability to harm their competition by orphaning their blocks, and to get a lower difficulty and thus higher profitability at the expense of other miners. A lower hashrate is also ultimately at the expense of the security of the whole network and everyone who counts on that security. These were promoted not as things confined to that new UASF forkcoin. These things were promoted and indeed endangered the original Bitcoin blockchain. If UASF miners ever succeeded in making blocks worthless, which were created by miners who didn't participate in the UASF, but instead remained on the original blockchain, this could rightfully be called theft, and perhaps other crime names, too. Promoting such action is not "just shitty rhetoric". It is actually criminal. Of course, given the forewarning of the publicity of BIP148/BIP149, Bitcoin miners could have mounted an easy defence against the theft (even without actually enforcing SegWit, which they ultimately chose), such as double-UASF or invalidateblock.
Then, the ability to take original, non-UASF bitcoins when a user uses SegWit on the UASF forkcoin is another effect that UASF has outside of UASF's little forkcoin project. It affects the original Bitcoin. This behavior was never mentioned or explained by UASF supporters. I'd argue this is a backdoor. No rhetoric from them here, just plain criminality.
Let us hear your case how creating a irreversibly splitting forkcoin that openly did not include a mandatory replay protection, but only an opt-in replay protection, would itself have been a crime.

You are free to suggest or support another idea for a unit name. I'm pointing out problems with one particular name proposal (I'd call it a trollposal) which I view as even more basic, important and irredeamable than the issues you see with microbitcoins.
@_date: 2018-02-16 18:10:15
Let's keep the matters of *units* and *unit names* separate, OK?


I am not making such an argument. I am merely arguing that the trollposed unit name is very bad by itself, and bad *relative* to both unit names that came before it ("bitcoin" and "satoshi"). I'm not entering an argument between the *units* bitcoin and satoshi, which would be somewhat off topic.


As far as I know, it was the original and first *unit name* that was coined (pardon the pun) and released to the public. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that what we now call a "satoshi" was only referred to using words such as a "coin", so it didn't have a proper name at that time.
@_date: 2017-09-26 14:15:09
The BIP148/BIP149 people, starting with the author shaolinfry *wanted* to orphan regular Bitcoin blocks mined by innocent miners and make the bitcoins on that chain worthless, in order to make their forkcoin more successful and thus more valuable.
BIP148/BIP149 didn't include any replay protection. BIP148 was actually *released* and *promoted* that way. If left to UASF's own devices, some of its innocent users (the marks) could have lost bitcoins in the unintended chain, which would have been the original, non-UASF chain. 
So, there was both an expressed desire to steal (however easy to protect against) and an unsaid way to appropriate (I wouldn't say "steal", given the circumstances) bitcoins, and it wasn't even limited to the new chain.

They don't abandon Bitcoin and their past mining rewards. You were talking about a reorganization. You are not even keeping to the same point.


You are trying to sell fairytales and mythology again. Miners demonstrably have a lot of skin in the game (i.e. the long term success of Bitcoin) - their hashpower and all that went into it. What do you have to show?


The sentence immediately after the part of my post which you quote says: "It prevents a chain split."


D'oh! Don't try to use features which are not safely activated yet! It's even worse without a Double-UASF - if UASF users' SegWit transactions are not blocked then they are spendable by anyone on the original chain, so miners could just appropriate UASF users' BTC for themselves (like an extra mining reward to stay away from the UASF chain, talk about shooting oneself in the foot). Nick ODell's Double-UASF can be improved with the addition of a second deployment of miner signalling for the soft fork on another version bit, so that things essentially go back to the status quo before the UASF insanity was initiated. Then, in the case of SegWit, if miners activate it normally (by reaching a signalling threshold on the new bit) such transactions become spendable again.
@_date: 2018-03-26 22:54:59


I don't think that anything needed to be shown at all. The reality simply is that Bitcoin cannot be changed through a soft fork without a majority of users and BTC owners on one hand, and a majority of the hashpower on the other hand both agreeing to it, whether they can see it that way or not. The UASF preachers were the ones who sold the disinformation according to which users completely controlled Bitcoin. Both of these absolutist ideas are equally wrong. Don't try to make a fetish of the fraudulent idea that is UASF.


That is conjecture. First of all, it didn't look like BIP148 UASF was going to cause anything at all for anyone outside of the few people who would have ran BIP148 all the way through the fork date.

Apart from alt coins, which can indeed in effect be part of the incentive in Bitcoin mining, as explained, you can also have other more traditional instruments/assets such as credit, equity, even real estate as an incentive. The latter two can be settled on a blockchain. Credit doesn't even need a blockchain to be transferred ([I recently commented about this]( So these things could be integrated with the Bitcoin blockchain and become part of the Bitcoin mining incentive.

You are right - anyone wishing to join as a hawaladar would have to prove they meet some criteria. You could say it is based on "proof of honor", and this is somewhat harder and slower to verify than Bitcoin's proof of work.
However, in a sense it is still open to anyone to start the process of meeting these criteria. What's important is that (as far as I know) it doesn't and can't have effective restrictions from authorities/malicious parties. It is decentralized.

Here's how a blockchain without its own token (e.g. bitcoins) can be useful for distributed consensus for things other than a currency. Instead of its own token it could use *credit* issued by anyone (individuals, banks, etc.) for payment of mining fees. A blockchain is simply not needed if you only wanted to transfer value, since you could simply transfer credit to the recipient. But for other distributed consensus uses it makes sense. The transfer of credit (as fees to the miner) can happen even outside the blockchain. It can happen with the credit issuer's help like this:
* Alice wants to post a transaction to the blockchain.
* Bob is willing to credit Alice (e.g. Alice has a deposit or credit line at Bob's fiat bank; or Bob is the custodian of Alice's gold).
* Mike offers mining services.
Alice sends Mike (1) transaction data to be included in the blockchain; and (2) a signed order for Bob to transfer credit from Alice's account to Mike's account when transaction (1) is confirmed in the blockchain. If Mike is satisfied with the fee he mines the transaction (1) and sends (2) to Bob. When Bob sees (2) he waits for (1) to be confirmed and then executes (2), paying Mike.
This is a bit simplified - you would want a few more steps like Alice asking Bob to certify to Mike that Alice has sufficient credit/funds in her account and to encumber that amount until the transaction (1) is confirmed. Then Mike doesn't have to trust Alice at all.
How can Mike deal with the need for trust in the credit issuers (Bob)? The same way it happens in finance today. Credit is discounted at a certain market rate which depends on Bob's risk of default. Mike can further reduce risk by hedging, converting, asking for immediate delivery/settlement, etc.
The role of Alice and Bob may also be played by the same person/entity.
Note: this scheme requires the same kind of market for mining fees as the one which Bitcoin will have to use when the mining subsidy (creation of new bitcoins) diminishes and disappears.
Why would you want to have such a scheme? To have the ability to pay directly with many traditional methods and instruments and issuers. Those can provide lower volatility than bitcoin over relatively long periods of time.
What would such a blockchain be useful for if not for currency? Check all the proposed uses for a blockchain - basically notarizing things and putting them in a chronological order.
Will it work well in practice? Credit brings weaknesses. Creditors can be controlled, and through them - miners can be controlled too. While under a credit system there can be long periods of very low volatility, there can be extremely rare "black swan events" of extreme volatility which can compromise miner incentives.
Well, you asked us to play the devil's advocate and that's what you get.
@_date: 2015-04-08 19:19:28


It does, but it has a lot of existing experience and tried and tested things going for it.
I can see this fundamental risk with mining (or anything else, really) that relies only on credit as an incentive. Credit represents trust in people's future ability to deliver, whereas a bitcoin represents trust in Bitcoin as a whole and in computational work already done in the past. Thus the value of credit is more vulnerable to be manipulated *lower* (e.g. threaten to nuke the world and that there would be no future) or to naturally diminish, at least temporarily.
If a proof-of-work blockchain temporarily stops being worked on due to a lack of acceptable miner incentives then the longer it stays abandoned the more blocks on the top should be considered untrustworthy (potentially the whole blockchain) due to the opportunity for creating a malicious fork further and further back in the blockchain. With credit only that could be fatal. With Bitcoin, those who trust it and need it are likely to hold bitcoins and thus incentivize the blockchain's continued functioning.
There could be a mixed system though.

So I guess these guys are reluctant because bitcoin has been often associated with drugs. Oh. wait...
@_date: 2015-04-08 13:31:19
Basically it is, but my argument is that you could use a mixture of credit that can be independent of the blockchain. It is not issued during mining or by miners, but it can be issued by anyone any miner has any trust in; it is not necessarily settled on the blockchain. A cryptocurrency blockchain has its own token, whereas a credit-based blockchain can be supported by many different independent credit instruments or mechanisms. So it is a "blockchain without Bitcoin" as per OP.
@_date: 2015-04-08 17:45:38
Good analysis. I wish someone with inner experience in hawala could chime in on these points.
I think we can agree that, basically, Bitcoin relies on fewer things and assumptions than hawala, and is more comparable to physical gold transactions and ownership than to hawala.
The "token" in hawala is actually a very heterogeneous thing, unlike bitcoin. I think the "tokens" in a hawala network can be more conventionally conceptualized as credit and/or equity (which can indeed in a sense acquire value on its own). I wrote a comment about [a blockchain based on credit](

@_date: 2018-04-28 06:25:33


This is true.


This is contradicted by what you just stated above. UASF was a different repository with different consensus rules from Bitcoin Core (the rules about activation of new consensus rules are themselves consensus rules). UASF constructs and demonstrates exactly an *exception* to the rule that miners don't decide on their own. Normally, users first adopt a soft fork (like BIP141 in Bitcoin Core) and then miners signal for it and activate it. Both users and miners decide. It goes through only if both users and miners agree. This is good. This is how it should be. A UASF does not do what it is claimed to do. Miners practically get full control over what happens to those naive enough to run UASF software, right down to the ability to appropriate the bitcoins which UASF users transfer, in the cases of new transaction output formats such as with SegWit. That's right, the security of bitcoins sent in new ways through a new soft fork absolutely depends on and assumes that the majority of miners *agree* to such new soft fork rules, otherwise the bitcoins can be transferred somewhere else.
This is so, because if a change to the consensus rules is not properly *agreed to*, the old rules are the legitimate ones (in this case, Bitcoin Core rules). This principle holds in law and other fields. It is a really simple social principle.
Users using UASF in effect give up full control to the miners, even if they delude each other that they do exactly the opposite.
Perhaps you meant to say that a good demonstration of the fact that miners are not in full control over the whole system is the failure of the 2x hard fork (which was never adopted by users).

What matters the most is what they hold as *reserves*. Well more than 50% globally is in one currency - USD. Moreover, I think most of it is electronic (centralized settlement, of course), which means that the Fed has even more ways to control it than just printing more. The power to print is big enough, since it allows them to pick winners, but with electronic USD they could even do something that a 51% attack on Bitcoin can't do. They could simply confiscate or erase some central bank's whole balance on a whim.
There's even something called the Bank for International Settlements, founded 1930, where 60 of the most significant central banks are members, so it is obvious that they have at least the *intention* to collude (although it is not clear to me who exactly has the real power).

Wrong, they only see the addresses in that *wallet*, which, as I suggested, could be a new temporary throwaway wallet which you better never use.
Moreover, the way Electrum works is that the client sends only individual addresses and not the master public key (which is what is necessary to generate all subsequent addresses of that wallet). You cannot see future addresses of a wallet from just addresses. So this is one more thing that you've probably misunderstood.

1. provoke public with anonymous advertising like this;
2. reveal the alternative (after some time);
3. ???
4. Profit
I think there are companies that would totally do it. I don't think this would give ammo to the competitors.
I'm not saying that this would be good or effective marketing in the end, but it would not be dumb. It would be cunning, although it would perhaps be too intelligent and niche (how many people care about centralization and how strongly?) unless they do more ads bringing forward all the ways in which mainstream finance is inferior, not just one.

It needs to be mentioned that there are some risks that arise from using Tor for browsing or other activities. One security risk [I already mentioned a couple of weeks back](




The other, regarding privacy, is that you need to understand that while Tor is intended to make Torified traffic unlinkable to your normal traffic, it does *not* attempt to make two different things that you do through Tor unlinkable to each other. E.g. if you send your personal details on one website through Tor browser bundle (TBB) and after that you send some bitcoins, then the two activities can be linked to each other. To avoid that you would need to run separate instances of Tor or to restart Tor between activities that you don't want linked. This is a must if anyone is to follow your advice "Use the tor browser for ALL browsing", otherwise it actually makes the life of spies *easier*.
On a side note, I really don't see why you say "2 groups: those who want to control you (govts, banks, police, etc), and those who want to steal from you"... it looks like one group to me.

This is true in theory. However, in practice this time is currently not near zero. It is currently limited by the transaction confirmation time and risk of double spending fraud. There are ways in which this could effectively go down to near zero in the future, like with a widespread use of financial instruments with which to hedge the whole exposure to bitcoins that are being used for trade (from the moment a purchaser gets BTC to the moment the merchant or payment processor gets the desired currency), but this is not a reality today. I think this would require large quantities of BTC being available for borrowing, and many BTC speculators/savers investing significant portions of their BTC into such instruments (trading liquidity for yield). Then all BTC exposure would be borne by speculators and the use as a medium of exchange would have no impact on the price. Until then, those transactions do have a non-negligible impact on the price (although so far this impact seems to have been smaller than the impact in the opposite direction of speculators turning into spenders).
@_date: 2017-05-31 02:55:52
I've [said it before](


I'll add that you have to take into account the fact that almost everyone who wants to manipulate Bitcoin or its price in any way is attracted to this UASF, as a vulture is attracted to anything that leaves carcasses behind. They will try to exploit any overreaction, underreaction, impatience, any sign of weakness or error of any kind. For this reason you should be careful not to publicly disclose your exact intentions or make too specific predictions before taking an appropriate position (like on a market). If we play our cards right we could potentially:
* see this contentious fork threat fail even before it materializes, as we have seen before;
* make the vultures incur losses in terms of money and time spent in the hopes of illegitimate returns;
* hopefully not have innocent victims, although some people who are dishonest with themselves and others will inevitably find ways to make themselves disreputable and poorer;
In short, the whole threat could become an opportunity to make our community healthier. It is not even a serious threat yet. It is lacking a lot, most crucially in mining support (zero known hashrate to support it as of now).
@_date: 2017-05-15 23:05:00
My criticism here is about the fact that all these implementations open the door for splitting the network. To me at least, it is entirely unsurprising then, that where there are chain-splitting proposals there is also "poor PR and ego battles" and I'd say even worse things. They go together like carcasses and vultures. *Vultures* either create them themselves deliberately, or identify the opportunities created by others from miles away and flock to exploit them. It is not desirable to be prey/carcass nor vulture, so if you find yourself in the middle of such a situation, it's probably a good idea to stay clear of it until it is over.
95% threshold activation does not open the door for a significant split (at worst we could lose about 5% of hashpower) so this does not apply there. The technical ideas behind SegWit, bandwidth-saving block relay protocols, and larger blocks are not passing things - they will probably find their way into the node software in some form eventually, and I'd be unsurprised if one day we look back and have to say "we got these things the right way and at the right time - not too soon and not too late".

What a novel concept! Mining bitcoins instead of bitching about miners! Seriously though, starting to mine is something rational, responsible, productive, and not just something purely lucrative.

Full freedom of movement, in these two forms:
1. Freedom to transact - it is possible, and relatively accessible, to circumvent any restriction on the transfer of money from one person to another. Bitcoin is potentially much more resistant to attempts to limit this freedom, compared to alternatives.
2. Freedom to keep - it is possible, and relatively accessible, to keep and carry one's own idle ("cold") bitcoins in a very secure way. One could passively carry bitcoins anywhere in the world. Alternatives either can't do without physical security, or sacrifice other important characteristics.

I've talked a lot about possible strategies - you can read my comment history. But what will they and the other miners ultimately choose to do - I do not know. It is possible that miners may keep private some of their intentions, or simply make a choice between several options in the last minute - both of which would lead to uncertainty for the side which attempts a minority UASF. What is certain is that they have many options to prevent whatever it is that they may want to prevent, or even make some gains.

I was talking about the big-block HF projects that preceded the UAHF. But since you bring this up, BIP148/BIP149 did in fact have this in common with the UAHF, too. BIP148/BIP149 promoters did in fact try to lure miners with the promise that the blocks created by other miners which do not conform to BIP148/BIP149 will supposedly be worthless. Some did in fact promote kicking certain miners out. If those things had happened as advertised by some people the implication is less competition in mining, therefore lower difficulty, and higher profitability for the miners participating in the UASF, at the expense of miners not participating.
Also, BIP148/BIP149 authors and promoters did try to belittle the risk of actual replay attacks and the need to include protections against them.
The UASF campaigns so far are no better than the UAHF campaign when it comes to respecting people's finances (that includes both miners and users). This is underscored by [one of, if not the main actor behind BIP148, considering confiscating coins as fair for a forkcoin]( Edit: But the UASFs were even worse in that they endangered money on *both* chains.

With BIP148 there are only two cases in which there will be no chain split:
1. If over 50% of miners run BIP148, and the entire remainder of the miners run a SegWit compatible version of Bitcoin Core or a derivative, and no miners run older versions of Core or other clients.
2. If no miners run BIP148 (which is likely, and much closer to where we are today with just one miner claiming to intend to run it).
@_date: 2017-07-25 10:23:19
I don't know what miners would do. However, BIP91 (and some other similar proposals) was designed worse than it could have been. There is no need to reject every single non-signalling block in order to lock-in BIP141. The blocks in the current incomplete re-target period don't need to be rejected, and the next re-target period could allow up to about 5% non-signalling blocks and still activate SegWit with no delay. The rules could have allowed the first 5% non-signalling blocks within a new re-target period to stay in. In fact, it would have activated even sooner if there were some non-signalling blocks with this change.
@_date: 2015-02-27 05:54:19
As far as I understand it, this is a very important enabler of larger block sizes, which in turn is one proposed solution for transaction rate scalability.
I say "enabler", because as blocks get larger, while other parameters such as the 10 minute block interval stay the same, you run into issues such as slow propagation, and from it, a significantly higher orphan rate, which can be a problem. From my calculation, a 20MB block would take about 10.5 seconds to be verified by each node before it gets sent to the next nodes, out of a 600 second block interval, and it becomes apparent that this would cause a high orphan rate, which incentivizes centralization of mining nodes. So this optimization has a similar effect to Gavin's recent ~~headers-first~~ [invertible bloom filters]( work (more about it on [LTB]( - blocks can propagate faster, which also ultimately helps keep the network more decentralized.

The full quote from OP:


I am saying that the "everything through a single Tor session" use case makes it easier for spies compared to the "specific things through Tor, specific things through clearnet" use case, not compared to "everything through clearnet". But in some ways "everything through a single Tor session" is worse than even "everything through clearnet" since it opens less sophisticated attack vectors (sniffing/sniffed exit nodes). "Everything through a single Tor session" just adds some uncertainty, but over time more and more of the different activities would be linked together by more and more of the spies out there.

No, internal politics is not what makes Bitcoin work, **good code is what makes Bitcoin work**. Internal politics are a tool for abuse of the kind you are describing. Dividing people.
BIP148 and BIP149 (if implemented with its current specification) fall in exactly the same category as the other clients you mentioned. I've called them shitforks. They are characterized by code that makes the network split, disregarding consensus among developers, miners and users. They are characterized by code that disrespects established best practices. They are characterized by code that shows a high level of carelessness, for security, for users' and miners' money, for compatibility, etc. They rely on political rhetoric to sell these reckless and disrespectful practices.

Title is misleading - Trezor will be supporting the Bitcoin chain for sure, and "most likely" also the BIP148 chain if* they split. Certainly not solely the BIP148 chain.

@_date: 2017-05-23 17:11:14
When both a BIP148 chain and a non-BIP148 chain exist persistently, those will basically be two completely separate cryptocurrencies with separate clients, separate code maintainers, separate everything. As such, each of the two separate communities would separately have the choice to deploy BIP149 separately for their separate chain (Did I mention "separate" ;) ).
Now, for the BIP148Coin community it would not make any sense to deploy SegWit again through BIP149, unless SegWit got disabled e.g. by a Double-UASF. Then again, the participants there would have already done a minority fork once, so I guess it's not outside the realm of possibility that some people might decide to do that again.
Even though the non-BIP148Coin community would have rid itself of some believers in minority forks for SegWit (the BIP148 followers), and have others who would have learned a lesson, it is possible that a deployment of BIP149 on the non-BIP148 chain could be attempted. In that case, those BIP149 blocks would be built on top of the non-BIP148 chain, and would not interfere with the BIP148 chain.
@_date: 2017-07-25 01:45:19
As first pointed out here, BIP148 and BIP149 did introduce the same vulnerability. It would have been exploitable in a scenario in which they split from the status quo Bitcoin blockchain, such as what was the base scenario at the time - activation with only a minority of hashrate enforcing the rule of rejecting non-signalling blocks (it won't materialize only because SegWit2x already happened to start enforcing the same rule earlier).
chjj even [implemented this in bcoin](
So, BIP148 and BIP149 promoters were putting users at risk of not merely their forkcoin being stolen. People using SegWit on the BIP148/BIP149 minority chain (let's call it UASFCoin) would have **lost their *bitcoins***. So, with UAHF users may be left with bitcoins and no UAHFCoins (the shitcoin in this case), whereas with BIP148/BIP149 users would have been left with just the shitcoins and no bitcoins! They could have lost everything this way.
So, where were you when BIP148 and BIP149 promoters were doing this? I called them out for their recklessness, bad advice, and, in many individual cases, intentional deception and subtle but very destructive fraud.

Far more concerning to me is the fact that 4 of the [6 seed servers]( are controlled by BIP148 supporters:
* Pieter Wuille - does not support BIP148
* Matt Corallo - does not support BIP148
* A person who, due to reasons I'm not allowed to discuss here, I will have to refer to alternatively as L. DAESHjr - supports BIP148
* Christian Decker - supports BIP148
* Jonas Schnelli - supports BIP148
* Peter Todd - supports BIP148
BIP148 is political by nature. It is an overt attempt to take over and centrally control the consensus rules definition (not that we'd let it succeed). For this reason I have zero trust that those four individuals would protect my privacy and not try to manipulate the discovery of nodes in order to further their overt agenda of forking and splitting Bitcoin when and how they dictate, if they ever get the opportunity. Having only two seed servers from people who are not supporters of that political movement is a precarious situation, in my opinion.

That's not the whole story. There is a very important good point in what squarepush3r said, whether he wasn't specific enough or didn't realize it.
When you are doing whatever kind of shopping, business or charity you usually use the same PC for the whole process. You see some bitcoin address on a web page and go to the bitcoin client to make a payment. If you do that through TOR (TAILS) and the web page is unencrypted ( except for hidden services which aren't accessed through exit nodes), or worse yet, misleadingly encrypted with a bad certificate, there is a very real possibility that a malicious exit node is going to do a man-in-the-middle attack. There have been many documented man-in-the-middle attacks by exit nodes, including ones aiming to steal bitcoins (blockchain.info) so **you should definitely assume that any cryptocurrency address you see through TOR through an insecure protocol is going to be fraudulent**.
That's why it is better to either stick to secure protocols or to use a second PC in parallel connecting through a more trustworthy internet route (if there is such a thing). I've mentioned before about the [two PC set up with a TAILS OS PC as an offline wallet](
@_date: 2017-07-25 05:00:39


That's not needed. If a reorganization was a concern at all they could use the invalidateblock command which is like a soft fork. It may not even be a concern if the UASF chain started slow. A reorg could have been too unlikely for Bitcoin miners to need to do anything. After SegWit outputs started getting appropriated (I wouldn't even use the word "stolen" in this case) by miners on the Bitcoin blockchain (where SegWit is not active) this would act as an extra boost for the effective mining reward on that blockchain, drawing even more miners away from the UASF chain. UASF promoters do definitely bear responsibility for belittling this known vulnerability.


Game theoretical *assumptions*, etc. don't preclude culpability at all. Game theory is actually not even favorable towards BIP148/BIP149. But what's important is that the actual outcomes are outside of the control of the BIP148/BIP149 software (edit: deliberately introducing a very possible and very dangerous outcome) and the people promoting it.


This is the same as with BIP148/BIP149. The spec deliberately introduces the chain split scenario. Miners can signal honestly and still the UASF nodes could fork off. That it is only one of several obvious scenarios is not important. There's a significant chance that it will happen. In fact, it is the default behavior. It's like if someone advised you that you should gamble all your bitcoins on a flip of a coin, heads you win nothing (returns par, you get to keep your bitcoins), tails you lose all. Even if you happen to "win" (i.e. lose nothing), you've still been defrauded. You are a victim. The advisor is the perpetrator. Even worse, in the case of UASF it's not a coin flip that decides the outcome, it's the collective actions or *inactions* of miners. You are introducing incentives for them to act in a way harmful to you.


One thing that is telling of these *UASF* projects is the way they make *reckless, appealing-to-emotion, deceptive subtractions from* the source code and their protocols that have no logical reason besides to belittle the people whom they disagree with.
1. Insisting that there should be no mining threshold for activation - 0%, even though 95% threshold is the current standard, 55% was the least that has been used explicitly, &gt;50% would be desired to avoid a chain split, ~15% would be strictly necessary in the case of BIP148 for achieving its stated objective of activating SegWit, and certainly much more than 0% for a blockchain to function at all. Belittling the role of miners.
2. Not doing anything to mitigate the base case of splitting the blockchain, instead spending their time assuring people that this is an acceptable or even desirable outcome ("kicking the miners out").


That's fair, but I'd go further and call these HF projects shitforks, fraud against Bitcoin users and miners. They are not actual children who can easily be forgiven. These are serious wrongdoings with real victims.


And the UASF campaign employed all the same elements of the crimes of the big-block shitforks, against innocent third party victims. They misrepresented the software. They told people to install the software. They told them that it was going to be safe. The outcome was not predetermined, or in the control of anyone. And so on and so forth. The victims are still victims even if they didn't lose money this time. Nothing can excuse the actions of the perpetrators. Wanting to spite big-block shitforkers is irrelevant. UASF shitforkers spiting big-block shitforkers is like warmonger politicians sending their supporters to war to spite some other country's warmonger politicians. The naive supporters on both sides still (potentially) die for no good reason. They've been wronged by people who they trusted.

I should have simply put it this way:
You can't get hurt socially by those people who don't have any voluntary interrelations with you (or with anyone else you do have voluntary interactions with).
Where there is no freedom of speech (communication) the voluntary interrelations are so limited as to be negligible.
You may be socially *punished* only within the group (the one with no voluntary interrelations to speak of, but violence instead), but that is unimportant (ineffectual), since it would be a group not worth having anything to do with anyway.


Sorry, I misinterpreted what you said.


Of course, except for those cases when one can clearly see that they are incompatible with their own existence, the laws of nature, etc., in which cases you could say that they are bad (for life decision purposes).


As I said, it's a matter of good life decisions, which, of course, everyone is free to make as they wish. I was merely arguing that people are not powerless in the face of developments such as social decay, cults. I do recognize that there are some negative externalities which you can't do much about (even if you don't interact, but are merely geographically present), however many of them and their consequences are somewhat predictable and avoidable.






An agreement can be implicit, as through actions. 
Where there is, for example, coercion there is both violence (a threat) but also cooperation, which requires some will (implicit agreement). Agreements can be subtle and mixed with violence, so then I should acknowledge that there is some element of society in almost any group of people. I think that, unfortunately, at some point some people and groups do so much harm that they become nothing but enemies to defend against.


I did say that governments are cults.
@_date: 2017-07-25 14:22:24
Right, it's possible. A split or a reorg can happen with or without delaying SegWit activation on the most worked chain. Some miners could refuse to follow SegWit2x rules (a.k.a. false signalling) which implement an agreement which they could well argue they are not bound by (NYA/HKA). The agreement could fall apart. Signatories could announce that they don't intend to support the 2x hard fork part and this will cause more signatories to withdraw from the agreement as a whole. The scenario of failure to enforce BIP91 should not be neglected. This scenario puts at risk those who continue to run SegWit2x/BIP91 nodes (mostly NYA signatories) or BIP148 nodes, who aren't many. Most of the Bitcoin ecosystem runs plain Bitcoin Core. This is one reason why recommending to run BIP148 is still, as always, irresponsible and reckless, not to mention unprincipled.


This scenario does not reduce the credibility of Bitcoin. It only brings a deserved reduction in the credibility of Bitcoin politicians, Bitcoin politics, horse trading, "compromise agreements" and other such points of centralization, control and rent-seeking. We are better off without these things. If, for example, only some BIP148 fanatics get burned because of running BIP148, I, for one, would see nothing unfair or unexpected. Nothing bad for Bitcoin. On the contrary, it would be a good learning experience for people involved with Bitcoin.
I'm not inclined to believe that miners would want to reduce the credibility of Bitcoin at all. There could be other ways in which the BCC announcement could fit into the picture. Look at its timing and how they announced that they'd mine it privately at first, which has the effect of conditioning people to expect a drop in hashrate at that time. BCC could turn out to be just a deception, a diversionary tactic, yet another hard fork that never materializes, like so many hard fork announcements that came before.

Here are a couple of definitions for society:




I claim that any group of people which consistently behaved in a way that *tried to* hurt someone financially, *socially (only within the group)* or physically if that person did something like calling government a cult, would not *have much of a real society, in the sense of voluntary interrelations* (edited this sentence). Maybe it could be considered an organization or a pseudo-organism or something else. At least there should be some sort of reciprocity. If merely saying something (which didn't lead to any harm as in e.g. threatening murder) was unacceptable to that group, then indeed there wouldn't be much of a point saying anything at all *within that group*, or listening to anything that came from that group. If there was no meaningful communication, then what society can there be? Society could only exist outside of the framework of such a group and that group, as a whole and separately, wound not be part of any society, unless and until it changes fundamentally.


Yes, I too believe that Bitcoin is something that enhances society.














It's a matter of good life decisions to identify a bad cult early on and act early on and not try to cheat destiny compromising with your values or being complacent. If you act earlier you will not incur much or any loss. If you've been fooled to trust the cult for a time, you should swallow your loss and move on. If you are at a point where you have no other choice but leaving wealth behind or dying not letting go, then you have to re-evaluate that wealth. You might have the subjective opinion that a property has value, but if you can't sell it or maintain your claim over it, haven't you already lost it?
Wealth and value are things that only exist in a society. As per the first definition above, if there is no *agreement* then it would not be a society, no matter how many people there are or how consistently they seem to behave.


It's not the only way. You may benefit *outside* the cult or *beyond* its lifetime (all cults end eventually).
Edit: Clarified one sentence in the beginning.

This depends on where and how the vulnerability was introduced and what part of the network it affects. Rules (such as code) which are deployed by only a portion of the nodes, and especially newly introduced changes to rules, don't hold the same weight as original rules which everyone has previously agreed upon and followed. If it turns out that there's a problem originating in code introduced only newly or only by some nodes, then the solution has to be the responsibility of those nodes, rather than anyone else's responsibility.


Only if the hypothetical vulnerability affects UTXOs going all the way to the blockchain's early days (i.e. there has been such a bug in the initial Bitcoin release), then orphaning several recent blocks would be less severe and undermining than infringing on the whole blockchain from its start. It would have been everyone's responsibility that they did not discover such a vulnerability and so they should all be able to agree that a reorganization is acceptable in such a situation.


If in doubt, follow the most widely agreed upon consensus rules, as written in code. So, accept the transactions and don't reorg. Only if all the consensus rule sets written in code since the initial release of Bitcoin are at fault (vulnerable) and conflicting with the pre-agreed principles of what Bitcoin should be (as written in the white paper and other documents preceding the initial software release), only then can a reorganization be accepted as legitimate.


Ah, so this sounds like those miners had enforced a "UASF"-like unilateral tightening of the consensus rules, rather than coordinating a soft fork with all the other miners and nodes (although I'm not familiar with what that process is that they have to "send these UTxOs to addresses where only their rightful owners could recover them"). That is the problem. All consensus rules MUST be **public** (all node operators should be informed about them), **agreed upon** (deployed by nodes and then there needs to be signalling from a supermajority of miners to activate them) and **objective** (executed by the open source code, not by some miner's subjective decision). At least one of these principles must have been violated in this case (sounds like it was the second one, or maybe the third). Either the orphaning miners were enforcing a rule which wasn't agreed upon/objective, or the orphaned miners failed to enforce a legitimate rule which they should have.


If so, then this is the problem. It's illegitimate and their actions based on it are illegitimate. Furthermore, they have caused damages to other miners, so they owe them.


You're asking the right rhetorical question. Secret, uncoordinated, not agreed upon and subjective rules are illegitimate and should be defended against. When the unknown miner's valid block was challenged by the orphaning block, all miners realizing what is happening should have invalidated that block. Those who try to orphan other miners' valid blocks should have their offending blocks orphaned in turn. This would be legitimate self-defence.
So in this case they should have all coordinated a soft fork for sending such coins only to the desired destination. Without such a soft fork, the next nicest thing a miner can do is to sweep all such anyone-can-spend outputs as soon as the miner sees them (to get ahead of any potentially non-nice miner) and then look for the users who made the mistake and give the coins back to them after a proof.

This is great news! Having Electrum on a Linux live CD enables some use cases that can bring a very good combination of high security and ease of use for a lot of users. Think about this setup:
Burn Tails 1.3 on a DVD-R and finalize it (so that no more data can be written in any way). Preferably use a dedicated PC with removed or detached hard drives, wireless interfaces, etc. Run the live CD on this offline PC to create a wallet and a watch-only wallet and then to sign transactions. Use a flash drive to transfer the watch-only wallet to an online PC (preferably a different PC, but you could also switch between OSes on the same PC). Run Electrum with that watch-only wallet on the online PC and use the flash drive to shuttle transactions between that and the offline PC for signing.
The preferred way to keep the wallet is to simply remember the seed and to type it in every time you load Electrum (It helps you keep your memory fresh, too. It's a bit more secure, too). Alternatively, you could keep an encrypted seed or wallet on the flash drive or the DVD.
It's a very secure offline wallet that is relatively easy to set up and use day-to-day. It's security is even better than most offline wallet setups that have been proposed - it's in effect like encrypted cold storage or a brainwallet which you can easily bring up for signing a transaction.
I think this setup can become popular as a cheap alternative to hardware wallets. Especially if we could fit this on a CD-R and run it on a lower-spec PC (256MB RAM) - you could have a setup that is literally dirt cheap even for a third world country.

If you keep the wallet file anywhere, you have to encrypt it (like by using Electrum's password protection) with a strong passphrase which you remember. You still have to worry about not losing all the copies of the wallet file. Yes, you can restore from seed each time and use the wallet for offline signing. If you go that route you'd want to memorize the seed (only) and not worry where and how to keep a wallet file with your private keys in it. I'd recommend to boot Tails from a DVD offline to create the Electrum wallet there, to then restore the wallet from the seed each time, but make sure you remember and won't lose the seed before you start keeping money in there.
2. A watch-only Electrum wallet on an online machine will generate the new receive addresses for you. When you only have to receive some bitcoins you will only need to open that wallet. When you want to send bitcoins you first open the watch-only wallet, create an unsigned transaction, transfer it on a USB drive or some other way to the offline OS, sign it offline, transfer it back the same way to the online watch-only wallet, broadcast it. Electrum was designed with this kind of use in mind, so it just works. It's many steps to send bitcoins, but it's not hard.
3. You can extract the master private key or individual private keys, but there's no reason to do that. It's all generated from the seed.
4. The watch-only wallet generates all the public keys from the master public key which is contained in it. With it you would *create unsigned transactions* (you can't sign anything with the public key) to be signed by the offline wallet. Seed and every single private key stay offline at all times.
5. To create a watch-only wallet first open/restore the Electrum offline wallet and click Tools-&gt;Master public keys, save it, and then transfer it to an online machine which can run Electrum, click File-&gt;New/Restore, type a name, select "Restore a wallet or import keys", enter the master public key. There must be an app for iPhone which can at least monitor balance and transactions for an Electrum master public key, if not provide you with all the functionality of an Electrum watch-only wallet (such as creating unsigned transactions) but maybe someone else, or a search engine can help you with that one.

I don't care about trading specifically newly mined coins. I care about being able to trade the future value of the BIP148 currency. Any BTC owner would own it if such blocks are mined. And if there's no such currency because no blocks are mined, then its value is zero and the escrow gives the money to the seller. It goes like this:
Buyer puts up coins, seller puts up coins. Escrow creates split transactions. Miners on both chains mine the split transactions. Once the coins are split, escrow sends all the BIP148 coins to the buyer and all the non-BIP148 coins to the seller.
If not enough blocks are found after some time on the BIP148 chain, escrow sends all money to seller.
If not enough blocks are found after some time on the non-BIP148 chain, escrow sends all money to buyer.

I have to agree with this admission that BIP148 seems to be designed for maximum network disturbance, for which it indeed has great potential. I always thought that BIP148 looks like the perfect trollposal to create. In fact, the idea of exploiting the surprisingly widely held misconception that no type of soft fork can split Bitcoin into two occurred to me independently, but I never advocated it, because I'm not a troll. Long before BIP148 I noticed that there seem to be people rooting mindlessly for "Core" as for a sports team, without an actual appreciation of the merits, just like there are people rooting mindlessly for alternative "teams" and clients which don't have much merits to speak of. There are people making uninformed decisions everywhere. BIP148 combines a soft fork mechanism deliberately changed in a way that makes it unsafe, with an [affinity]( with Core (specifically through SegWit). This has a huge potential to fool people who have been largely unmolested by the alternative clients that came before, not for any better reason but merely because they came from the "other team".

It is a good, prudent practice. What if someone openly backs out of the agreement? What if new hashrate opposing the agreement comes online? What if people decide that it's a good idea to postpone or accelerate activation due to a bug or some other unforeseen factor? Any of these things, and others, could create a coordination problem. If there's only a flag date activation condition, with no other checks, and it turns out there's only a minority of hashpower enforcing on the flag date, the blockchain splits. This is a very dangerous and disruptive situation.
The software should have the best feedback possible to take into account such eventualities and prevent bad outcomes. It would be irresponsible not to at least use the mechanism that is already available and tested (BIP9 - activation by hashpower threshold). Even this mechanism has weaknesses, such as the possibility of miners falsely signalling, but at least that would seriously damage the reputation (for keeping their word) of any miner doing this, plus, any attack involving this would be very risky and difficult to coordinate in itself.
In short, it is a decent coordination mechanism within the software, at least in non-adversarial conditions.

Calling the original, non-forking project "Classic"? What a novel concept.

I agree, it would help a lot. Not only that one, but also other incidents which led to loss of money for miners and users, such as the chain splits in March of 2013 (Mike Hearn was involved) and July 2015 with BIP66 (the validationless mining of the time was shown to cause great risks). I'd definitely read more about the BIP16/17 ordeal.

Behold the Necrobitcoinwizard!
It is a work in progress and it could see some improvement.
Hail the Necrobitcoinwizard!

I too like the MS Pain stuff a lot. It's hard to explain but I just have extra respect for such stuff. Here's the newer version of My MS Paint work:

Inspired by [Impaled Northern Moonforest]( Check the About section [here]( if you don't know about them.
Also, please let me know what you think about my work. If there is no interest I will probably abandon it.

Funny how this is exactly what I think of and would expect from an epic work of art involving a wizard. A battle, a long and interesting tale incorporated, and maybe some hidden meanings. This is what I was thinking and focusing on when I created my submission which apparently was no good overall since it was ignored.
Nevertheless I decided to incorporate shazow's 8-Bit Satoshi Wizard into my battle scene to see how it turns out, just for the lulz. This is how it turned out:
