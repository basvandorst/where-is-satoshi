How about equipping them with battery packs, and configuring them as wireless repeaters off other people's service (after using Aircrack-NG/Reaver on host). 
After accessing host router, set QoS to limit RPi to 50% max bandwidth. 
Another option would be to equip the pi with a 4G USB dongle and an anonymous SIM card (bought with cash/pre-paid debit). 
Then charging $1/hr or $5/day or whatever you want for access.
Hide them on roof tops in cities.
Attach them to a decent battery pack with rechargeable batteries, and an Alfa WiFi usb adapter connected to a powered hub. 
You could custom build a container that would house the RPi, the battery pack, USB hub and multiple Alpha Adapters. So you can use MIMO on 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands. 
Put them inside something like a locked cash box with holes drilled for antennas and spraypainted black. 
Could be attached to backsides of dumpsters in cities with magnets. 
Come by and change the batteries on a frequency dependant on the battery pack. 
Having one connected to 4G near a subway entrance, and then repeating the signal along the subway track. 
Could be interesting. 
If you are concerned about losing devices, attach a USB GPS unit to the RPi, locked inside the cashbox.

As in **YOU LOSE YOUR BITCOIN**.
That's the **BOMB** part of it, idiot.
You're right, it is a scam. It's a scam that tells you exactly how you'll lose your money.
It's a game. You fucking retard. If you buy it, and sell it you make money, but if you can't sell it, it explodes and you lose your BTC.
If you are too retarded to understand the object of the game, then yes, it's a scam, it's a scam for people with IQs in your range.

Additionally you could setup RPi to connect to EarthVPN (or similar). That way no one could trace the RPi, and host account would not be able to see any traffic. Nor would host ISP.
Turning it into an Onion Pi (routing all traffic over Tor) is another option, although probably unnecessary.

The only time I smelled a limited hangout was when RT reported that Snowden leaked evidence that OBL was actually killed by Seal Team Six.
Anyone who pays attention is aware that the Seal Team Six story is a fabrication. 
But under further review, there was was no actual proof or evidence supplied. Only a budget that included DNA testing of OBL. 
Not exactly proof, imo.

I'm aware of all of this. 
All I want to know, is if by some miracle, paypal converted to a hybrid BTC exchange slash payment processor (as it always has been, unchanged). . . 
How would that effect the price of BTC, and the BTC community? Would we see widespread adoption if PayPal made it so USD and BTC were seamlessly interchangeable? If that was still the prefered payment method for ebay, and BTC was the prefered currency of paypal?
I assume price would skyrocket, and mining would become profitable again. But what else?

Funny you should say that. If posts like these were allowed to remain, maybe I could have found someone else saying the same thing.
But for some reason, the mods of this forum don't want this post to be seen publically.
That's strange. I wonder why. Sure seems like it would help the community to know who you can trust, and who you cannot.

Whole Foods is a giant scam. 
They suck Monsanto's dick, while overpricing their foods and calling them "healthy".
And for the record, I have no idea what you were getting at with your incoherent comment. But since it sounds pretty stupid, I am guessing you're pretty stupid, and therefore think Whole Foods is good in some way.

To all the people saying "I would go back to using NewEgg if they accepted BTC", you may want to try out 
You can submit any link to them, and pay them with BTC, and they will place the order for you, and have it shipped wherever you want.
This is a service I would like to see take off (until wider adoption).
