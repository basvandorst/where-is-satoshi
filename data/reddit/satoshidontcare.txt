This is a wonderful idea. I never personally dealt with Gox, but I would love to see if we can amass enough keys to perform a meaningful analysis. 
Pulling this off* would be a prime example of the power inherent in the public ledger. 
*Whatever that means exactly. Finding the cold wallets?

You are absolutely correct and I do not know why you are receiving downvotes. Well, I do know why, but you should not be. 
However, you failed to add the obvious and necessary advice: Online exchanges are not wallets. **If you (and only you) are not owner of the private keys, then you do not actually own the bitcoins.**
I gave you an upvote. Your point needs to be seen.

Though, of course, you could just add proof-of-stake (or whatever else is necessary) to the bitcoin protocol. There is no need to, as you say, "move to a proof of stake currency".

I am unaware of why it would be impossible. Do you know why?
However, there is no real consensus about this being a real threat (though it surely could be) and if so, how to properly solve it.

Well put.

They could and it would be very reassuring. However, what is even nicer is not having to rely on them at all to secure your bitcoins. Always keep your bitcoins in secure wallets that you control. That means only you know the private keys. 
If you insist upon keeping any amount of coins on an exchange (in the wild, out of your possession) then limit it to the absolute bare minimum for what you intend to do with them.
