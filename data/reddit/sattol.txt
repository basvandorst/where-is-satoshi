You should order a demo from chain analysis and try it for your self. 
For me it was showing from the time of Mt.gox and all other exchanges I have used for trading. Which coin comes from which exchange and how many percentage. 
I hope whirlpool would work.

US has 10% of total crypto trade. I wonder why we only hear crypto news from there, as if it’s the only country that exist. How about the other 90%?

SEC is the New China and ETF is the new “China bans bitcoin”.

I just googled president of USA .. it says a “reality TV actor.” 
Now I know why it’s always on the news, it’s a show business ..

I tried using this wallet. It’s not as private as they claim. First you need to make lots of transaction to get stonewall activated. After that it does coinjoin like transaction from your own group of bitcoin addresses. 
After that I checked on chain analysis software and it detects everything.. all that effort was useless. 
Even Andreas was recommending this wallet.

last time I visited, we Drove cross country.. we drove almost 13600 miles around USA saw about 50 land marks. 
It’s a huge beautiful country. But honestly it’s not like how they show it on TV. It’s falling apart. Everything looking old, roads are not in a good condition. Above all, people are not happy there.. very aggressive.. left right political shit and every one is angry. 
One thing was amazing about people there, they had some love for their country and proud to pay tax.. while more than half of the money is used for bombinng some country half way across the world. 
I also drove around Australia, Asia and Europe. Honestly, things look much better there. They are doing much better.. roads are better, people are more relaxed.

It’s about time to tell the truth to the masses, enough of those goons bickering, whining and marketing all the time. We need more of these videos. Good initiative from Jimmy.
