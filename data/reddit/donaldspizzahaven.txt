The NASDAQ isn't composed exclusively of tech companies from the 2000's. Not a good chart to go by.

Companies sell stock for the purposes of raising money. People buy the stock and are cut into the proceeds either through dividends or an increase in value due to the demand of the stock depending on the success of the company. Crypto is barely comparable to stocks.

What part of that was incorrect? Are You just a salty lil bitch who has lost all his money on this crap?
@_date: 2018-01-27 18:17:42
Isn't it FOMO-inducing, you-can-be-rich-like-me stories like this that created the bubble which we are currently experiencing?

For someone to make money in bitcoin, someone else has to lose money in bitcoin.

Not sure why the increments on your Y-axis increase exponentially. That's a bit fucky and misleading.

It's a tired phrase, but once again points to flaws in the decentralized and uninsured system that is crypto. 
@_date: 2018-05-22 11:24:15
Not sure if joking.

He could just put it in crypto and lose the key or die. It'd be so much easier.

Not sure if the creator is denouncing all types of currency, or just shitting on bitcoin. The analogy was lost. At least gold and silver will be tangible and usable after the apocalypse...not like crypto.
