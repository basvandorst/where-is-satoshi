The prices would normalize back to wherever they where before. Lots of people would see the value of their wallets fall as much as they had risen, but eventually I think things would stabilize. The thing is, big market manipulations would do little to destroy the utility of what bitcoin is as a value transfer mechanism.

It's ok, I'm in a similar position - not everyone headed west during the gold rush either.

The network IS tied to utility though. One fax machine is worthless. Two is useful. One in every office is very useful.

$4,350,000.30, to be exact. 
Of course your account would also be flagged, and your funds frozen indefinitely. 
Good luck withdrawing your money when you get the funds released, due to the 500 dollar a day limit, it would take you 300,000 days, or 821 years.

Potentially, sure. But at the same time, Everyone would *know* about it because of the transparency of the system, so there would be no sense that Bitcoin was inherently unstable, and it seems doubtful that they could destabilize it permanently with a single massive pump and dump, because it doesn't do anything to destroy the utility of the system long term. If they continued to do it in cycles, they would basically make a big machine where they transfer government dollars into the pockets of speculators.

Eh, some of us don't feel like giving paypal our bank account info. I was wrong though, it's 500 per month, not day.

Isn't the alternative reading of this, that the supreme court just told us that lower courts DO have jurisdiction over the NSA?

BTC is very divisible so what would end up happening is the coins still 'out there' would become more valuable, thus the cost of obtaining them would go up. The whole thing would continue to spiral as they bought more and more coin.
