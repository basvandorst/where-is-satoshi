After years of crypto experience all I can say is that all the predictions are total bullshit. Patience and persistence pays off. Naked on the couch and waiting..

After years of being part of this crazy market the only sensible advice I can give is one to do exactly the opposite of what most people are saying.

Careful purchasing devices from websites different than the companies main.
@_date: 2018-10-03 11:49:30
Uh, Coinbase claims they now have 25mil users, while total Bitcoin supply is 21mil, which means not every user can purchase a whole Bitcoin.

This is the worst place where you can ask for financial advice. As Bitcoin might be very promising you will probably lose all your money if you do not know what to do and how to secure it. Educate yourself first.

[  \- a website where you can check price movements
[  \- easy to use, secured place where you can buy your first Bitcoin. Then you need to send it to your Exodus wallet.
What you need to understand is that your coins aren't stored on your wallet, but on the blockchain. We use different browsers to access our coins in a way very similar to how we use different browsers to access websites/information on the internet.
P.S: be extremely careful with phishing and pay attention to security

Yes, they do have KYC and so do most exchanges. Exchanges is where you purchase your coins before you transfer to any wallet.
If you do worry about privacy you can check LocalBitcoin or try mining Bitcoin.

We can't be sure gold actually has a limited supply. Limited, but how much is it's limitation today? And what if, during the next decades, enormous gold reserves are found on Mars? It will be only a matter of time to get to them. What happens with gold's price after?
Bitcoin is a better form of gold.
