Not necessarily. Bitcoin is pseudo-anonymous so as long as the artist took appropriate precautions they should be able to receive and redeem their donations without ever publicly connecting their real life identity to their artwork.

What's wrong with demanding accountability and the full disclosure of the facts? And if a crime was committed then the perpetrator should be held accountable. There's nothing fundamentally wrong with government. I don't think anyone would believe we'd be better off with at least some of the trappings of civil society. Police, fire service, basic utilities, arts, culture, all these are things that are helped by the coerced collective support of the public commons commons.

I'd say a diversified crypto currency portfolio is the safest long term investment. You won't necessarily maximize your roi but you will hedge against downside risk to any one crypto currency.

Well, if you could do it without being detected, which I don't think would be possible since you'd be finding blocks at a rate far in excess to your natural mining capacity, then it would at least superficially appear to be possible. In reality it wouldn't take long to fork the blockchain and update the hash from SHA-256 to SHA-512 essentially destroying the value you created cracking SHA-256.

Are futures and options available for bitcoin yet? 
@_date: 2015-05-06 06:08:35
Who cares? Centralization was an issue when bitcoin was small, all that matters now is adoption, adoption, adoption, and to get that we need applications. Heck just one blockbuster app would drive adoption more than anything else. Personally I think that application is going to come in the form of colored coins but that's just me, I'm a sucker for products and colored coins connect the coin to the good and that's where the real magic happens, where value is exchanged for real goods.

I'm torn, on one hand I want to believe his was a righteous act of civil disobedience. On the other hand it was clearly an immensely profitable one. Lastly it appears he's bankrupting his family in order to defend himself. He was reckless and selfish, albeit righteous and correct.  His market place likely saved lives and reduced violence associated with the illicit drug trade, for that he deserves a lenient sentence, ideally time served. But that's unlikely.

Littering and...
@_date: 2015-05-21 07:41:41
You make an interesting point. If the network becomes pervasive, what does that mean for the price of bitcoin? Could it stabilize and then ultimately decline as the cost of clearing transactions drops to zero? I mean I know there's a functional limit but considering how many bits there are to work with the hard limit on the number of bitcoins hardly seems significant if they're only used as token transactions for real world stores of value. It'd be like investing in cloud server instances and trading CPU hours or something like that. Pretty unexpected is right.

Unless you can predict the future I wouldn't be counting on the relative value of BTC to whatever currency you pay your bills with. If you can spend BTC now then your better off buying BTC if you can't spend BTC and would rather save BTC then you need to create BTC. You can do that by either selling something for BTC or by providing resources to run the system. The best investments are the ones that work, what works depends on the individual. Do what makes the most sense for you. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 00:35:45
Yeah but donations to you aren't tax deductible and you probably aren't qualified to do the research. You could maybe be a research subject at some point though.

 Bitcoin needs two things, a PR company to speak on behalf of the currency as a whole, not any particular company or trading platform. An independent advocate funded by the network itself. I'm not sure exactly how this could be fully executed given the decentralized, pshdoanonymous nature of bitcoin and it's lack of a central authority but a hundred BTC a month committed to PR would go a long, long way toward shoring up the base and building support for future growth. 
I'd also like to see BTC support a Lobbyist or PAC in the US and in other countries in order to ensure that Bitcoin is treated fairly under the laws of the nations in which it's users live.

That's good to know. How would an enhanced encryption algorithm be implemented in the bitcoin economy should it be necessary?

I don't know, but my gut tells me that where there's a will there's a way. ISP's could block transactions. Governments could shut down exchanges. Global financial institutions could conspire to execute a 51% attack. I'm sure there are other ways to destroy bitcoin and expect others might dispute this fact. The bottom line is nobody really knows, only time will tell.

I'll let others with more detailed knowledge speak to your specific questions. I would like to remind you that Fiji is under dictatorship. And the dictator doesn't seem to care much for those who don't think he's just the [awesomest guy ever.]( He also doesn't much care for the draft [Fijian Constitution.]( It seems people are starting to question the value of even [having a dictator.]( So I guess what I'm saying is you'd best be sure what your doing isn't going to land you in a Fijian jail under the watchful eye of Dictator Bainimarama's police force.

I work with a non-profit cancer research group that accepts bitcoin donations called (the SETH group)[ and am working on convincing our partners and vendors to accept bitcoin payment transfers.

For those interested in learning more about the research being done by the SETH group scientists. Dr Garret Yount and his research partner Dr. Sean McAllister will be participating in an AMA on April 20th. They'll be answering questions about their research and will be sharing their thoughts on the future of cannabis as medicine. Their upcoming research project, code named The Cannaca Project will be investigating the anti-tumor effects of a standardized cannabis extract on glioblastoma brain cancer using an advance gene sequencing technology that's never before been used to study an actual therapeutic agent.

The cases would be completely different. The Liberty Dollar hoped to replace US Currency as the National Currency of the United States and in the process overthrow the Federal Reserve and the established monetary system we have here. It wasn't a post-national currency like bitcoin which operates beyond the bounds of national sovereignty. Open networks and good encryption will ensure that bitcoins will be transferable between willing parties regardless of governments opinions on the matter. Sure it may hurt the relative value of bitcoins if governments were to move to delegitimize them or restrict their exchange but all that would do would force the bitcoin economy to be more dependent on the transaction of goods and services rather than primarily an economy dominated by speculators sitting on coin-banks worth tens of thousands of dollars on appreciation alone. Bottom line I don't think it can be outlawed because it's not trying to be the National Currency of the United States. It's a post-national currency dependent on open networks and peer to peer connections.

That's funny, I just spoke with my uncle about it who's a wealth manager and has several billion dollars under management, his clients are mostly fortune 500 CEO's and the like and he tends to be very, very conservative, since most of his clients are less interested in making money than they are in not loosing the money they already make. So I doubt he'd put any of his clients money into bitcoin but the idea got me thinking. What would happen if someone were to commit say $100M to bitcoin related investments?

Thanks for the advice, I'll definitely be posting about the project here and on other bitcoin forums. I've actually been talking with some of our vendors and research partners about bitcoin and hope to be able to pay for some of the actual science that will be doing with bitcoin. Some of our partners are overseas so there's a good case to be made for transacting with bitcoin as apposed to their national currency, especially given the rate of growth recently. I created a wallet and will be posting the address along with the post. My biggest question is how do I prove that contributions made to a address are in fact going to the parties indicated. I don't want people to think that I'm misrepresenting anything or question my credibility. Would you think it would be adequate to simply link to a page on our website where the address is listed? It's nice that bit coin can be annonymonus but it can create challenges as well.
