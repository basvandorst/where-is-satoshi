It's kind of a long story, but it started with one guy who snuck on the mod list by promising to clean up spam with some bots he was writing.  He then used a technicality to boot out the founder, take control for himself, and began trolling all the members.  He did things like turn off anything but self posts, enabled contest mode to prevent discussion on it, and banned all the top posters.  There was a half-serious facade that it was about quality improvements, but meanwhile he was submitting brag posts to about how enjoyable it was to watch the community crumble.  They were able to get the sub undefaulted a couple weeks later.
To prevent everyone from simply jumping to a new sub immediately, the trolling was staggered and came with silly pretexts.  There were things like initial promises to allow sub voting on changes before making them-- then voting was disabled for the thread.  Then a promise to have a separate sub to talk about moderation and voting changes-- then that was made private.  Then to include more members of the community-- then dozens of anti trolls were added to the mod list with ban powers.  It just went on and on with stupid games like that until one guy went "undercover" and leaked the chat logs proving it was all deliberate maliciousness.  Ruined an entire community with a decade of history almost overnight.

Comes across as inauthentic to appear to participate in a culture without actually caring to understanding it.
Say I bring my cousin to a baseball game and he doesn't know the players or anything about the team.  Theres no problem there.  Now what if that same cousin decided to paint his face, scream, and chant all game.  But still knew nothing about the team and never bothered to learn.  You'd wonder why he was trying so hard to appear interested and dedicated, and probably find his actions to be fake and off putting. You also wonder if he has much else going on in his life if he's so willing to spend time feigning interest in this without any background in it.

In the baseball example, it wouldn't be exclusion at all.  You'd be happy if a cousin game with you occasionally and showed some superficial interest.  Or you'd be happy if he got really in to it and started watching it all the time and talking/learning all about it.  But there's an incongruency when someone demonstrates a superficial knowledge while presenting themselves as someone with a deep interest.
I remember my friend met a girl who claimed to love Kant and enthusiastically declared him to be her favorite philisopher.  When asked what works of his she liked, she couldn't name any, and later confessed to never having read any of his works.  I don't mind someone who goes either way, but to see that struck me as very superficial and trying too hard to impress someone.

If they improve their site nav/usability to cater to men and nerds, they'll get more variation on their sheet orders.  And lowering their prices and expanding their products will suck up all the amazon and tigerdirect purchases.

When I put in enough for a Super Nintendo, I went to the bank to withdrawal and count my interest.  I had lost so much money to account fees that I wouldn't ever be able to get a super Nintendo.  Still haven't.  They stole hundreds from a fucking kid.

Then change the people.  Independent merchants benefit the most.
As far as sending money to your family, do you really use paypal?  Please describe a scenario where that's the most convenient method, because I can't think up one.  Whatever the reason, creating a Coinbase account for your mom requires no effort and can dump funds straight to a bank account.
In terms of receiving money, that wasn't part of your original claim but it'd be easy to let anyone paying you know that they could get a discount by using Coinbase instead of paypal.  Just deduct the difference in fees from their transaction.  If they can't handle that (which is understandable at the moment), I'd personally switch to Google Wallet or anything else to avoid PayPal.  I could see the hiccup with receiving money, but sending money in btc should never be a problem.
@_date: 2014-07-06 14:03:22

Bills other than 20s?  Why?  When I had a physical bank, I cashed a 5k check and they gave me bricks of 20s.  They didn't have enough 100s so I had to walk around with a stack of 20s anyway.

And no one's holding a gun to my head preventing me from renouncing my citizenship and living on raft in international waters.  "It's a free country, go live on a raft" is not an answer to me having a problem with omnipresent institutions.
My job wants to direct deposit my check.  My electricity bill needs to be paid from a bank account.  The retail goods I buy from Amazon require a card linked to a bank account.  Banks and checking accounts are ubiquitous in society, and they're almost impossible to avoid.  In part because of this, they're also super predatory when it comes to bilking consumers.  I have a problem with both these things.
That's why I like bitcoin.  Avoid the vulturous banks.  Make a leap in convenience and safety through technology.

For what it's worth, you could be a lawnmower and be involved with bitcoin by simply accepting it as payment.  No degree required.  Just like you could be involved with oil by working as a chef on an oiling rig.  But petroleum engineering is probably "the most" directly applicable when it comes to working with oil.  I guess computer science would be the bitcoin analog.  You can directly contribute to the protocol and software ecosystem then.  Although nothing says you need a degree to get started even then.

Fraud?  If I accidentally drop a hundred dollar bill into a tip jar instead of the $1 I was inteding, is that fraud?  This is basically the exact same situation.  And the tip receivers fished out the bigger bill and gave it back-- that's the decency part.  There's no requirement for it at all because no one can take more than you give them.  Unlike, with cash, where people who are expected to give you correct change or with credit/debit cards where theyre trusted to only charge your card the amount they say (and not use your card number to buy themselves things).  That's a system that *requires* trust.  Bitcoin is the opposite.
In terms of "the bitcoin interface", have you ever used it before or are you trolling?  There are a number of different wallets with all manner of interfaces.  You can choose which you prefer.  The QR code standard helps gaurd against incorrect amounts because as soon as you scan, it automatically inputs the BTC amount and displays the equivalent value in a currency of you choice.  Compare this to check verification processes that tend to believe whatever amount is input by the person depositing it or card scanners that can be adjusted any time after youve already paid and left and are just as prone to miskeys and typos.
EDIT: Whoops, I fed the troll.  Sorry I fell for it.

I told everyone the password is a set of words, including things like "social security number" and "mother's maiden name".

I've described the file as simply "my financial account and password information."  It also contain list credentials for all my online and financial accounts, so this is accurate.  And my family would never actively seek out that info while I'm alive.  And if they did, I'd hear about it.

"Compile" in this respect is a very dubious qualifier.  A more accurate term for what most of those engines are doing would be "minification/optimization."  
There's also the concept of rolling the source code and the interpreter into a single binary, and that certainly would qualify as compiling.  But that's a very odd piece of customization that would come with its own weird ball of worms.  I've never heard of it being done in the real world on a web server for any reason.

You could roll the php code and the interpreter into a single binary, right?  Some of the engines seem to do this based on their descriptions, and I've seen it done with other languages.  There'd probably be an intermediate step of boiling everything into C first, but the original source is technically php so it still counts by all definitions.

Let's break down the possible scenarios and things you're trying to safeguard against.  For the sake of simplicity, say that you are the author of an illicit site, and the feds are out to get you.
In scenario 1, say they've already caught you and have the server contents.  You're now only looking for ways to keep them from proving you are the author in court.  In this situation, they have found source code on a forum from your account, or on your computer, or some compromised VCS server linked to your name.  They also have the code (plain, obfuscated, or "compiled" to unreadable machine code).  In this case, any process you took to obfuscate your original source from what's on the machine can be repeated with 100% accuracy.  They just have to run the same tools as you.  Doesn't matter if the result is plaintext or binary.  Compiling will not help here, you're screwed and the advice is unhelpful.  Nothing will prevent a conviction here, but that's beside the point; your suggesion offers 0 protection.
In scenario 2, say the feds have gained full access to a server, and are trying to figure out who the admin is.  You want to prevent them from including you as a suspect.   In that case, I'd first ask if can code be helpful in finding out who you are?  The answer is that outside of outrageous circumstances, I don't think so, regardless of what state the server's code is in.  It's not like with J.K. Rowling's discovery where source heuristics can tie two projects together (although that would be cool).  Programming is way too standardized for this to matter unless you do something obscenely weird like name all your variables in Navaho or put your name in the comments.  Furthermore, any process that was done to the code can be undone with fair degree of accuracy. You'd be more damned by access logs or config files/test scripts/project metadata storing unexpected things like your dev machine's identifiable user directory in them.  That's how Stuxnex was linked to Israel, and sophisticated, obscured machine code with encrypted modules didn't help there.  So your advice also fails in this scenario to afford any protection from all but the dumbest mistakes.  And doesn't address the more likely ones.  A better, more broad suggestion here would be to avoid putting any identifiable information on the server.
Keeping all identifiable information off the server is easier said than done, so an even better suggestion here would be to do full disk encrption to prevent data access after a raid.  And to limit access and update patches to prevent any hot intrusions.  Also, always connecting to the server in a secure way like TOR, especially when performing admin functions, so logs and monitoring can't point back at you.
In scenario 3, you're under investigation and they're trying to link the server to you.  In this case, anything like SSH keys, passwords, dev tools, code, test scripts, test environments, feature lists, design docs, screen caps, etc etc can implicate you.  Any process you to the code will not help here!  It needs to be somewhere if you're going to maintain it, right?  So a better suggestion would be to keep it off of locations linked to you.  Perhaps going as paranoid as to do all dev/test work on a secure remote server and never store anything locally.  Maybe even on the server that site is hosted on if you have that secured properly (which is the opposite of your suggestion)!  But I think you'd be able to get away with doing it on even your home machine if you take the same precautions like full disk encryption, limited access,  updated patches, etc.  So long as you're not storing stuff in your email account or a forum, or github, or keeping paper printouts around your house or something.  And you'd have to be accessing the illicit server in a secure way, like TOR in case of monitoring to prevent linking you to the server.  This advice is all independent of what you offered. and considering that any code obfuscation process won't actually protect what you're working on, what you offered doesn't do anything at all here.
In scenario 4, the feds have neither you nor the server, and are just investigating for leads.  You're trying to prevent them from IDing you as a suspect.  In this case, compiled code also doesn't matter because they won't see it!  Except for the trivial stuff like the publicly-consumed JavaScript/HTML.  Outside of obscenely ridculous things your name in the comments section or Navaho method signatures, obfuscation/minimization won't do anything here at all.  Useful advice here might be to not tell your friends or post on forums about what you're doing, even in the abstract, and especially if it's linked to your name, account, email signature, or anything else that can be used to find and start an investigation on you.
So while there are plenty of stupid mistakes made by DPR, and lots of painfully-obvious advice to be gleamed from this situation, your input doesn't seem to help in any way or in any scenario I can imagine.  If you have anything else to add, please prove me wrong.

"Latte" was just the note he entered on BitPay for the transaction description.  The order for a $4 specialty 20oz latte and $2 scone also included a $2 tip.
@_date: 2013-05-23 01:54:37
It sounds weird because it didn't happen.

I will gladly accept one of your reddit gold donations!
@_date: 2013-12-09 08:37:22
Chinese Yuan are used by ten times more people than USD for just that.  Popularity doesn't automatically make it better.
@_date: 2013-12-09 05:17:51
Wasn't just a latte!  Ordered a couple food items too.
@_date: 2013-04-20 05:29:31
Too bad the complexity increases with the amount of processing power devoted to mining.  So if enough of these hit the market, they'll just be diluting their own value.  But there certainly are benefits to getting there early
@_date: 2013-11-01 23:05:30
I went to the site to order one to slather on some Carolina BBQ.  Then I saw a main bullet on your home page saying "No Strong Vinegar Taste or Odor," and knew I had to get another bottle.  Then I saw you were only charging $2 for shipping on top of an already good price of $5 per bottle and you just won me over for a couple more as gifts to bring overseas.  Order 996.
You're doing everything right.  So many wins here.
@_date: 2013-12-10 17:45:12
Good suggestion.  I just went ahead and added it.

Just mod He's got experience killing subreddits.
@_date: 2013-10-16 07:16:20
It's his job to act that way.  That's what he's trained to do, openly, with no tin foil hat required.  Whether or not he actually, internally, personally really cared is irrelevant.  His actions likely would have been similar either way.
@_date: 2013-10-04 18:01:24
Holy shit.  If the NSA wasn't already wearing the "evil villain" hat, this would be pretty damning.  The strategies they're considering here are fake nodes, revealing they already have 3, and trashing the infrastructure so that it's too slow or unreliable for users.  "Hey, we can't hack this (super important, critical, life-saving) service, so let's break it."  What kind of horrible people came up with this?
@_date: 2013-12-08 06:15:26
If only there was some kind of system in place where we, as members, were empowered to determined what kinds of submissions appear...
Nah, that's not feasible.  Mods please help!
@_date: 2013-12-09 18:05:45
Ah, too bad he wasn't there!  Very cool of you to jump through all the hoops like that to get it going like that.  If you're ever around on a weekend, I'd be happy to treat.
@_date: 2013-04-20 05:23:22
Wow, you weren't kidding.  He's willing to accept bitcoin for the equivalent of $25/coin.  I thought were were supposed to be getting discounts here, not paying 400% markup.

Begs the question?

Great!  Owner's name is Tony.  Ping me on Reddit if you're in the Lake Norman area and I'd be happy to treat you to some real barbeque.
@_date: 2013-12-09 15:12:47
Cool!  The owner is named Tony.  I'm not sure if he's trained all his employees yet (just implemented bitpay yesterday) so you might want to ask for him if you're paying in BTC.
It's a great place regardless of payment system, so I'm glad you're checking it out!
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:38:34
Maybe he bought them with stolen Wikileaks donation funds
@_date: 2013-11-02 13:04:01
This is true.  It has no legal definition and only serves as a marketing term.  Like adding "delicious" or "fiery" to the slogan.
But the site does qualify what they mean by "all natural" with a few more specific bullet points:
* First Ingredient is Peppers or Fruit 
* All Natural, No Preservatives 
* Low Sodium 
Given this, I think they're using the term fairly and based on what consumers would expect it to mean.
@_date: 2013-10-02 20:00:33
Just ask how to do it on Stack Overflow

A muffin and scone.  Foot massage was a separate check.

In this particular case, yes

Their main consumer product is shit.  Their company and the R&amp;D they do is unbelievably awesome.

And, as he mentioned, taxes.  As long as governments pay or collect in an exclusive currency, it'll retain some value.

There's plenty more where that came from:

What kind of custom code do you expect to be on the server?  And what would you expect it to be compiled into?
Secondly, what kind of identifying information do you expect to be in the source code?

Other than ease of spoken descriptions of whole numbers, perhaps the psychological effect of unit bias?

Nuanced concerns about double spend attacks probably weren't being considered.  It was more along the lines of "am I going to wake up one to discover my money gone with news that the system was all a big scam"?  Once that was fear was assuaged, the issue was settled.
In terms of double-spends/confirmations in a physical location that doesn't transact more than a few microbits at a time should, a single confirmation is plenty safe.

Redundancy.  Chances are that one of the guys who attended your bachelor party will remember that stripper's name.  And you can probably count on none of them giving it up to your family while you're alive.

This is even better:

Oh, my bank cancelled it.  Hmm, better try again later.
Never got around to it :-(

Using the money to defend our rights today might be worth even more!
Plus, you can never be sure that the value of BTC will increase in the future.  Objectively, it's a risky investment.  And EFF isn't in the business of investments.  
I'd love to see the value go through the roof and end up providing heavy funding for the EFF in the future, but holding on to those bitcoins might not be a prudent decision.

I was at EVR Pub in Manhattan a couple days ago.  Got a QR code on the tab and swung my phone over it to pay the whole amount in BTC.  So easy to use.  Very cool tech and I can't wait to see it take off everywhere.

As a side note, a friend of mine recently died unexpectedly.  I spent some time at his parents house before and after the funeral, and they tasked me with getting access to and shutting down all of his online accounts.  Breaking into his MILFHunters.com profile was probably the most fun.  And when they called his mom back asking for confirmation on the account closure, many a laugh was had by all.

I think people will "just go ahead and downvote" because it's hard to extract coherent statements from your post.  And because you sprinkle it with random whining about zealots and downvotes.
But the clarification does help.  From my understanding, you're saying that this whole incident will turn out to be a a good thing for bitcoin in the end.  Someone tried to stealing resources to mine bitcoins.  They put a ton of effort into it, stole a huge amount of resources, and still just barely succeeded.  They made a fraction of the profit that was made by the old methods of fraud.  And because of this proof of inefficiency, fraud of resource theft and bitcoin mining will be less used and less linked together.  Which is better for legitimacy and acceptance of the technology as a whole.
That was a good point.  Probably would have gotten a lot of positive attention if you were more clear about it initially.
