I think the next step is multiple payment processors like bitpay optionally supporting it for purchases.  Is there a QR code format that presents a lightning invoice that gracefully degrades to a legacy invoice?  That would be perfect here.

@_date: 2018-01-24 04:26:35
I'm hoping lightning will continue to pick up and we'll see a processor like bitpay start to accept it, then many vendors integrate via it (and via independent implementations).  Then we will see a much more appealing fee profile.

This simulation doesn't treat any day different than any other day, so it'd never find something that specific.  It's basically a roundabout way to give a +-% change range over a given interval, so you could work out what the 2017 was (though i guess you'd be using 2017 data to generate it so it'd be useless).
This is scarcely more scientific than saying "well, it went up 300% last year, so it'l go up 300% this year".  It just does it at the day level.
@_date: 2018-01-10 05:51:27

If you disconnect from the lightning network and can't ever reconnect before your channel expires, I believe there's a situation where you can be considered "uncooperative" by your peers and lose the funds you staked.  That said I'm super interested and will be spinning up a testnet one soon to try it out.

@_date: 2018-01-19 16:16:45


The graph changes significantly depending on this exact window, so it should be labeled on the graph.  The graph does look like it has anchor points every month and then smoothing (which is kind of misleading), so monthly sounds correct.
@_date: 2018-01-19 18:22:44
Or more simply, if you think the price will either go to $0 or $100,000 you place a buy stop.

@_date: 2017-12-31 20:02:40
Specifically it influences the chances of finding a stale block.  I only mean to be talking about mining nodes here.  The larger the block, the more time other miners waste mining on a previous block that hasn't been sent over yet. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:48:02


You don't want to do that.  That locks the funds up.  From what I've seen you probably only want channels to be open about 3 days.  Still the point stands, you'll pay two transaction fees per 3 days, for any number of bitcoin purchases using LN.
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:49:26
There's a fee to open the channel and a fee to close it, but the intermediate microtransactions have no inherent fee.  Using opening and closing a LN channel just to buy two coffees is necessarily not cheaper than two traditional transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:32:38

carryover basis is weird, how do you know?  That's an odd thing to ask. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:41:38
There's still a "home team advantage" for finding the next consecutive block that gets bigger the bigger blocks get, which serves to further advantage the largest miners.  Centralization is a very real problem, but the consequences of it are not immediately obvious to day-to-day consumers and users.
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:56:27


I believe you are mistaken, but I can't quite figure out what you mean.  Full nodes won't/can't create different block chains.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:57:03
Don't the coins get freed by the expiry of the original? 
@_date: 2017-12-27 03:39:45


That's called a contentious fork, and because of the way difficulty works, it's incredibly difficult and expensive to do.  You can easily verify that a block is mined at "real" difficulty, and you'd need to basically burn money if you aren't mining bitcoin with the same consensus rules as the majority.  
The theoretical vector for this attack is to secretly hide 51% of the hashpower and mine a longer chain, say 7 or more blocks, to double spend even "successful/verified" transactions. However, at this point, given how many miners there are, that would cost at least several billions of dollars (depending on what assumptions you make about how you get the hardware and the electricity).
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:04:19

TBH that's a kind of arbitrary statement.  They did enough proof of work that they found a block, it just had some of the wrong settings.  It's true that if you rewound time and replayed it with the only thing changed being their destination address, they wouldn't have found that block, but that's a silly way to look at causality and probability.

Miners can refuse to ever include even the first transaction from a tainted address, so it could theoretically be possible that the atomic swap could never take place.  It'd have to be blacklisted basically on the very first hop though.

@_date: 2017-12-31 17:39:52
The issue isn't just running a full node, it's the orphan rate in proportion to hash rate.  Once the largest miner finds a very large (300mb+) block, they don't need to send it anywhere to start mining the next block, but everyone else needs to wait for it to upload and download (I think there are ways to skip this, but they represent a speed-security tradeoff).

actually, if we're talking about impossible changes, i'd prefer for the default base to be 12, so 10 was 9+1+1+1.  It's basically never beneficial to me that I can split 10 into 5 with no repeating decimal, but it is very often inconvenient that I CAN'T split it into 3. (2,2,3) is a much better prime factorization than (2,5).

@_date: 2017-12-12 19:33:14

@_date: 2015-06-04 06:11:59

I know you have made a name for yourself, but I'm not sure how given how poorly thought out things you say are.  The very idea that we would promote only the "good guys" to add an alternate POW mode, but that the "bad guys" wouldn't have that is absurd.  That alternate mode would also necessarily hurt efficiency, driving anyone who DOES comply out of the market if the plan never comes to fruition.

Uh... you don't understand how the bitcoin protocol works.  At any point, before or after this change, miners can accept or refuse any transaction they want to.  They can still do that. Also fees make up only a tiny % of mining income at the moment, it's more important to boost adoption than increasing the fees on any given single transaction.

You need to be way more specific... what scenario are you talking about?  Taxing capital gains is all about finding the 'basis' for the object (what you 'bought' it for, or 0 if you mined it) and taxing the difference when you sell it/trade it away.
Losses can always offset gains from the same year, and 3000 per year for future years (if you lose $30,000 in one year, you can write off $3,000 of taxes each of the next ten years).

Hashing is irreversible.  Once you hash a password, you can never recover that password.  This is why it works so well (especially if you salt it) for storing users passwords:  you hash it when they sign up, and then again when they try to log in and compare.  You can't work backwards from a database of hashes to passwords (unless you already recognize one... which salting helps protect against).  However, if you need to store a password to use with an external service, it needs to be stored in a recoverable format and by definition the server needs a way to access it.  Therefore, if the server is compromised, no matter what, that password is exposed. 
This does NOT mean, however, that it needs to be checked into the main repo.  In this case here, any developer on the entire project has direct access to the direct access to the official company blockchain.info account.  This is not a necessary weakness.

That's not a transaction cost, it's a storage cost and should be prorated by value stored, not per transaction. 
Also the fees were recently dropped /10.
@_date: 2014-05-19 13:28:13
Yeah, there's two parts two it:  The fact that it's a 2 of 2 multisig address, and that the transaction is "give bob 2btc and give alice back 1btc".  If alice tries to publish any transaction except that one, Bob won't sign it.  So by being 2 of 2, Bob can enforce his end of the deal.
Weirdly, this ends up being an instance of that game theory game where the first person takes any amount of money from the pot, then offers the other person the rest.  The other person can either accept the money, or reject either player getting any.  The 'correct' play is for the first person to take 99% of the money, and offer the 1% (or whatever the minimum useful increment is) to the other party, and for the other party to accept it.  Humans don't actually play that way of course :)  But it's something to think about.

The gross thing is that if the price drops a TON just after a difficulty change, that difficulty is locked in for "two weeks", but really "two weeks worth of 10 minute blocks at the current hashing power".
If 99% of miners leave the market (which they probably wouldn't... what else would you even do with an ASIC?), then it would take 200 weeks to readjust, and it would only readjust -25%.
That's quite unlikely, but it's still an interesting failure mode to think about.  In the interim, there would likely be a hard fork to force the difficulty down just to get everything running again, but that would be tantamount to admitting bitcoin is a failure, as it shakes the confidence in the basic premises of mining and proof of work.

It's probably a matter of the way they track and handle refunds and cancellations.  They might want to pin it to USD, which could have legal consequences in other countries.

The strange thing there though is that cost is neither paid by the sender nor the receiver, but the holder of bitcoin, and part of the service there is asserting that that bitcoin is still being held at that address (which means even $1 per transaction is too high, since there's some cost associated with simply holding the blockchain).

Sorry, you don't really understand the security implications of what you are talking about.  The idea of hot/cold wallets (which is industry standard security) is not at all compatible with physical addresses per user account.  Do you know what a cold wallet actually is?

This is a critical first step.  The next step of paying for overhead in bitcoin won't come until much, much later, and until then it's entirely reasonable for businesses to convert immediately into USD.
@_date: 2014-01-07 04:21:10
Would this remove the ability for pools to have fee agreements to include transactions at a flat overall fee?  Basically, say, Coinbase pays a flat daily rate of a few BTC to a pool, and every time the pool finds a block, they automatically include all coinbase (feeless) transactions.

We do not need to entice companies to gamble with us on the value of bitcoin.  Just getting them to use coinbase is plenty good, each vendor that begins accepting it is one step closer to a closed-loop bitcoin economy.  Since basically every company today still has  overhead in dollars, no matter how you cut it they'd need to sell their BTC.  Doing it immediately is only good.

@_date: 2014-10-21 17:33:48
That's kind of a silly way to think about it because bitcoin is fungible.  It doesn't matter if your specific coin go to help build a school across the country, or to fund a police department somewhere.

Possibly due to the fact that he isn't withdrawing into cash, but paying to a bill-pay network (which might itself be reversible).  So the two fiat transactions can be reversed if push comes to shove and they aren't actually taking on that much risk, except for the bank fees from the chargebacks.

It's 100 satoshis, and it is proposed as the default unit of account for bitcoin.  IE, instead of saying you have 1 bitcoin, you'd say you have 1,000,000 bits, and "Bitcoin" would only refer to the protocol/network.
@_date: 2014-01-06 13:47:30
Because of the way signing messages works.  You can't use just the hash of the private key as the public key cryptographically.  Whenever you spend from a hash address, you necessarily need to reveal the public key (which is then verified to be hashable into the address), and simultaneously sign the transaction with that key.
Multisig transactions and fancy stuff like that also use the hash, this is why a script of arbitrary complexity can be used with the protocol:  The other signing parties need to know what the original spending criteria was, because it gets hashed down to a fixed length.

Unless there's a way for vendors to re-replace fee.  If the recipient of a transaction is allowed to say "wait, pretend that transaction had N fee instead and include it" suddenly they have a recourse:  At the very worst, a dead man switch.  The vendor doesn't get the money, but since the scammer loses it, there's no incentive to scam.

You gain by deflation when others lose or buy in. 
@_date: 2014-04-16 03:52:45
Sure.  It would take some change to the protocol, but thinking about it, the more direct way to make the change is this:
Say Alice pays from address A1 to merchant Bob at B1.  Before that transaction completes, Alice double spends it to her address A2.  This service, for example, would help try to mine that A2 transaction.  Additionally, somehow Alice has managed to get most nodes to hear of A2.  
The change here would be fore B to spend the money from B1 to no output, and for nodes (and miners) to weigh the total fees of A1-&gt;A2 vs A1-&gt;B1-&gt;F (only fees, no output).  If Alice publishes a new version of A1-&gt;A2 with higher fees than B1-&gt;F, Bob can publish a new version of B1-&gt;F spending even more of the original amount to fees, which results in a bidding war.  At worst, Alice can burn money Bob thinks should be his, but this is a very poor form of griefing.
There are some negative consequences of this approach though, and it might not be the best way of dealing with this problem, but it's interesting to think about.

Sure but that's cents. 
Part of the issue here is that the user is then still depending on the merchant not to inadvertently leak the data. If the merchant sweeps the coins from those addresses to soon and in too small of batches it still associates them very strongly.

The only reason this technically wouldn't happen is that difficulty is only recalculated every N blocks, and can only drop by 25% per recalculation, so if hashing power suddenly dropped by 1,000,000 fold, it would take 1,000,000 times two weeks for the difficulty to update... and it would still be 750,000 times too high.

Pools can join p2pools as 'individuals'.   
There might actually be a long-term, sustainable advantage to this approach, some 10 centralized pools together in a single p2pool, so they don't orphan their own blocks (just eachothers), but at the same time it's not that much trust placed in any one given organization, while at the same time getting the lower variance of the total p2pool.

There is no progress between 'tries' when mining a block, and 10 minutes is not a hard limit.... it's a random target.  Miners constantly add transactions as they hear about them up to the limit of their own choice, at which point the highest fee transactions start bumping out lower fee transactions (give or take).  This does indeed change the merkle root which 'invalidates' previous work, but the previous work already didn't find a block.  Every time you hash is a atomic single try, it takes just a moment to try a nonce and know that it isn't valid.  Does that make a little more sense?

The point is, nobody can steal your money with escrow unless the seller and escrow agent collude.  No one person can steal the money for themselves. 
If the escrow agent dies suddenly but the buyer and seller still agree on what happened, the money still goes to the right place.  You don't just hand the btc to the escrow agent and ask him to give it back to the user who deserves it.

Well there's an obvious and direct fix for this, but it has an obvious cost: raising the blocksize limit can hold more than 7 transactions a second, but it makes running full nodes more expensive and pushes non-professional miners further into the margins.

In the same way that unconfirmed Bitcoin transactions are escrow?  Ie, not escrow. 
Incidentally, you can do assurance contracts with Bitcoin. They are of dubious value, but basically you publish a transaction 'I spend this 1btc input and there is a 100btc output here.', which you combine with other similar messages until the entire transaction becomes valid.

Bloom filters are good at getting no false negatives and a small number of false positives (tunable by how much space they take up).  
As a metaphor (this isn't how it works, but imagine for a moment), you had 32 addresses each with 64 digits.  You take two digits from each address, then assemble a new block of data  (AAAaaa, BBBbbb, CCCccc -&gt; AABbcc etc) and go to your peers and ask "does anyone know of any transactions that have any two consecutive digits in common with this address?"  
You would get false positives, but no false negatives (if they had such a transaction, no matter what you would hear about it), but they also couldn't reconstruct your addresses from that data.
Bloom uses bitwise or instead of chopping numbers apart, but it's the same idea.

There's no way to do a folding or SETI PoW thing.

You can have VISAs that operate within the ecosystem of Bitcoin, doing entirely off-chain transactions and reconciling the user's account with the merchant's account at the end of the month or whatever.  Bitcoin is a money foundation on which banks can be built, and will still serve a purpose.
@_date: 2014-05-18 11:29:50
Ok... How about this. 
Bitcoin addresses are all different shaped pegs. A bloom filter is a hole in a block cut a certain shape that all of your own address pegs fit through it. If you give your play mate a box with this hole and tell him to put in it all the pegs that fit, he won't know for sure which pegs are yours, and which pegs just happen to fit.  Bloom filters even let you tune the hole a bit wider, if you don't mind getting a box back with way too many pegs in it (and carrying it/sifting through it yourself).

The miners all realize that their own coins only have value in as much as people have faith in the underlying protocol... any violation of that violates that trust.  It would basically require a 51% attack to do this.

Well, technically the value of the dollar would drop in this circumstance as the economy transitioned over to bitcoin, so there's no limit to the USD:BTC exchange rate, but there is a limit to the BTC:Cheeseburger exchange rate, for example.
@_date: 2014-01-09 17:35:36
Well there could be a new part of the protocol explicitly for that case:  the recipient being allowed to re-sign a transaction with the recipients key, and with higher transaction fees simply for the purpose of 'undoublespending'.  It would be a hard fork, but if anything, would make the protocol more robust.  I can't think of a way to abuse it, and it lets people double spend for legitimate reasons (including a higher tx fee on a duplicate transaction to get it in a sooner block, whereas currently this is very difficult to do, getting your money stuck in limbo).

Apples and oranges.  Neither of those are the weak part anyway, if you're trying to compare BTC and LTC.  It has to do with signing a transaction and immediately revealing the private key by doing so (imaging having to publish the private key in addition to signing transactions... it would do weird things but wouldn't technically ruin bitcoin.  That's where the ecosystem would be after quantum computers got 'good enough').

@_date: 2014-03-25 18:09:29
It's not as easy as it sounds.  If the big miners collude in as simple a way as notifying eachother first of new blocks found, the attack is almost impossible, since it relies on not broadcasting a block until you hear of someone else trying to broadcast a block, but once the big pools tell eachother of a new block, it's too late and the greedy block is immediately orphaned.

No.  Definitely not.  There's no way to know who saw what except to post complete logs of it via the blockchain.  You can't just say 'ok, everything everyone saw up until 10 seconds ago' because there's know way for you to know what they saw or them to know what you saw, and furthermore, that would produce a blockchain that wouldn't actually be usable to figure out how much was at each address.

They continue on and come to another pile.  The second economist makes the same offer to the first, if the first eats it, he will pay $10,000.  The first considers, then accepts.
They continue on and one of them says "What was the point of that?  We're both back where we started, except less happy by having eaten that shit."
"Yes," says the other "But the GDP went up $20,000."

@_date: 2014-02-03 05:27:31
To explain a bit more:  Bitcoin addresses can either be the hash of a public key (the normal thing we think of as an address), or a hash of a script.  The scripting language is pretty basic, but supports enough.  Usually they would be something along the lines of "Either this transaction must be signed by sig A or (sig B and sig C)".  But you could also script "Add 2 and 2, and if the answer is 5, the coins can be spent".  
@_date: 2014-03-05 17:46:53

@_date: 2014-03-28 23:15:39
I think you misunderstand something.  If you mine during a high price then sell during a low price, you get to write off the low price sell against the high price mining gains, it works out exactly as if you didn't need to report mining gains immediately (and instead treated those coins as having a basis of $0).
The only difference is you are forced to pay that amount of tax in the year that you mined rather than any other year.

On the other hand, they designed their difficulty to drop so fast that just numerically highest block doesn't even count to me.  The "most total work" chain will unambiguously stay BTC.

@_date: 2017-08-21 06:14:37
Smaller blocks = higher fees = some transactions priced out of the market, such that there will be less total transaction volume.  If that's a bug or a feature is an exercise left to the reader.
@_date: 2017-08-21 06:09:45
Yeah, but why even show that win?  they could make it so they post odds, and the lower end winnings do work and let you cash in and out, but nobody ever wins the larger amounts.  It would be much harder to detect than something super obvious like this guy's experience.

Unfortunately there's a way to abuse this.

This is a problem with the other banking systems more than banking.  You can chargeback credit cards or contest a paypal sale, but once a bitcoin transaction is made it's irreversible by any institution, so it's not practical to sell by those means.
@_date: 2016-12-05 14:38:43
and more than that, the moneypacket thing never proves you actually sent the coins, where changetip did immediately.

I guess they are included in the next block?
Not necessarily the next, they will be included eventually.  If you put no fee on a long busy period, it's possible for your transaction to expire from the mempool, in which case you can send the coins again (with a fee this time, having learned your lesson).

@_date: 2015-07-08 04:37:47
I agree with everything you have said.  I hope we can get the pr reconsidered.  Maybe there should be a separate threshhold?  mintxfee total, and mintxfeeperoutput, that is smaller, but not THAT much smaller.  say, 1/5 the size.  So for 5 outputs, you pay the same mintxfee as today, but for 50 outputs, you'd pay 10 times as much.

@_date: 2016-09-23 14:32:03
I'm not saying it does.  When you 'update' a row in postgres, it writes a new row with new data, then repoints all of the indexes (including the primary key) to the new row, but the old one is still physically on disk.  By this inane definition, it means postgres is "Readonly".

If you reuse addresses, it is not safe.  But you already shouldn't be.  
The path to fix this is to come up with a new private/public key system once we can clearly see the horizon of sha256 being reversible, and spend to those addresses before it becomes even marginally practical.  This upgrade can be started at any time.

It is a fork of bitcoin, but it used the same ledger at the point when it was released, so the private keys that you had been using for BTC also work on the BCH chain. One BCH is worth about $530 right now, so it's a nice bonus.  Still sets a strange and worrying precedence.

There's no way to challenge that someone is actually running a full node because they can just proxy any request to other full nodes.  This makes an incentive almost impossible.
Maybe in the far future, there can be incentive structure for full nodes where some % of the block reward is shaved off by the relaying nodes every time they relay a block, and the miners chose the version they've heard of that has had the least shaved off, but im pretty sure the bookkeeping for that is impractical at the moment (and I haven't worked out if the incentive structure actually works in the wild).

We don't know what % of other coins since then are also burned though.

Well, in theory, you could ask new transactions beyond a certain block to list in some metadata what was the most recent block (with header) they heard of (and maybe another one 6 blocks before that), then if that block is not within N hour of now, discard that transaction instead of rebroadcasting.  Each node/miner can chose their own N.  There are a small number of use cases this breaks, and a small increase in size per transaction (that only needs to be relayed, not stored), but it seems like an overall win.
@_date: 2016-05-23 22:26:07

The first most of your comment is right, but it reads much more clearly if you separate "price inflation" (aka prices going up) from "monetary inflation" (money supply going up), rather than just calling both "inflation".

Addresses have checksums, you can't send to most piles of address-length characters, and you certainly can't add characters to them.   For simple typos, the software can know and reject the transaction.  This is simply a case of coinbase  being backed up and having not-great customer service.

@_date: 2017-07-30 02:17:28
You need to specifically make a transaction that will show on one chain and not the other.  That's the tricky part.  The legitimate BTC transaction you describe may be valid on the BCH chain, in which case those coins will move too. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 00:34:46
I don't think you know what an altcoin is.  You can just checkout bitcoin on github, change the root block, magic numbers and pairing, and have an altcoin. Trying to SELL altcoins is a waste of time, but using them as a sandbox is perfectly reasonable.  Look at zerocoin.
@_date: 2016-05-29 18:14:50
 &gt; Finally, if a hardfork was executed to change the encryption mechanism, it would almost certainly invalidate the old mechanism. 
I mean, you'd technically need to leave both valid for many years, and obligate everyone to spend from the old system into the new system.  It's impossible to just move coins over without moving a signature weakness over.

Yeah, you can create a transaction with huge fees, and then not publish it, just included in blocks as you try to mine.  Then, when you finally mine the block, the fees will go to your mining address and are semi-untraceable (except that it's such an obvious and weird thing that in no way does it actually launder bitcoin).

But at the same time, merchants are only interested in BTC if people actually spend them.  If it keeps deflating, there's no room to actually spend em.

The difficulty there is abuse.  I will definitely allow user submissions, but there has to be moderator intervention because I need to know that one of the moderators can confidently expire the contract negative or positive.  If it's badly worded, untestable, or with controversial resolution, allowing user submissions to be bet on would actually undermine confidence in the system.  I want to word things in an airtight way that always resolve one way or the other.

I'm pretty sure double spending works without having 20%+ of the network hashrate, at least for sites like satoshidice where they don't wait for enough confirmations.  I don't think anyone both has enough computing power and the will to double spend like your chart indicates.

I was under the impression that the dies cut for Avalon ASICs for example are specific to SHA(SHA(f)) and you can't just patch that out in firmware.  As this kind of hardware gets more prevalent, a coin that doesn't mine SHA(SHA(f)) would be comparatively more attractive to mine via GPU.
I don't think this carries over to FPGA at all.

I'm working right now on an Intrade clone with pretty significant usability modifications.  I'm trying to target it a little bit simpler and including sports (and americans) to attract a wider audience.  I will have a brochureware site up this month and am targeting a beta launch mid-to-late april.  It won't have those odd time-weighted bets like bitbet or bet of bitcoin, but instead the straight up intrade way where you can buy and sell your bets up to and including during the final phases of contract settlement (for example, un-betting on your home team as you watch them lose their game, selling it for less than you bought for).

The EV of breaking into a car and knowing how to hotwire vs knowing how bitcoin works is very, very strongly in favor of hotwiring.  There is little to no benefit for car theives to learn about BTC (except that it would probably make fencing them easier).
@_date: 2013-03-20 16:22:08
What would you suggest?  Remember that since bitcoin outgoing transactions are irreversible, any mistakes would have to be covered by the transaction fee, and if it's too high, the exchange would just straight up get clobbered by competition.
@_date: 2013-03-13 20:36:04
I don't mean from that perspective.  I mean, if everyone buys bitcoins and hoards them, sure it will cause the $ -&gt; BTC price to rise, but it won't make bitcoins any more attractive to businesses to accept, since they are just being hoarded.  Making sure businesses WANT to accept bitcoin is important to the long term success of bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-05-13 22:01:41
Yeah, you could mine on your own, and instead of your reward being .01, .01, .02, .01, it would be 0, 0, 0, 0, .... 0, 0, 25, 0, ....

Yeah, and if the rate is zero or positive, then you are just speculating on the losing end of the value of bitcoin, like if you borrowed 50 BTC in December and had to pay back 50 BTC now, that would be a HUGE loss.

Again, it depends on the risk/reward. If you have enough power to have a 30% chance of catching up, and last block had more than 4 times the fees of this block, the incentives might push you to deliberately orphan. 
@_date: 2013-05-27 04:42:05
Even better than that, Bitcoin specifically has a contract for this.  You sign a transaction that says 
"I will give you .1 BTC and you get 100 BTC", which obviously doesn't make sense, but you can combine it together with other transactions until the output equals the sum of the input.  This way, unless the total number of pledgers pledge, the transaction is invalid.  Then you can layer on top of that an expiration date and M of N stuff (and handling fee for Kickstarter, but would that even be necessary?)

There is a way for the central developer to sign messages with a specific private key to tell miners what to update to.  You are right that getting average users to update will be difficult though, but that is definitely a bridge we're going to need to cross at some point.  They did just release .81 that has one of the date-powered hard forks, miners are expected to upgrade from .7 to .81 by May 15.  Hard forks that only affect miners are one thing, but changing the entire protocol is pretty different.

But kickstarter has to determine if the pledge has met a given threshhold.  How is that calculated with BTC + USD?  If the price of BTC suddenly rises, can the goal be met with no further donation?  If it drops, can it be unmet?  Say instead, you convert BTC to USD immediately and pin the value at that.  When the kickstarter fails to reach it's goal, how do you refund those users?  If the price of btc has risen, you've lost value by making that conversion and wouldn't even be able to buy back the BTC to refund.   It's not a simple problem.

Even better than that, there's a way to use MATH to make an escrow account that neither party can access until they give their half of the private key over to the other party.  This way, the only scamming either party could do would be to trap money in an inaccessible escrow account, not get it themselves (so it would be griefing, not stealing).  This would be a strong enough incentive not to do so, presumably.  No third party required (though in some cases definitely nice).

Uh, you realize that current ASIC dies aren't exactly cutting edge, right?  They are just ultra-purpose-built.  If AMD builds a die with their current tech and level of expertise (and especially economy of scale), but purpose builds it for mining, it will blow anything we have now totally out of the water in terms of hash/s/$.

To do it slowly, you have all orders insert into a pending orders table, then have a job on a single thread that goes through this table and enacts them as fast as it can. The 'advantage' of this is that since you can guarantee a single worker thread that does the orders, it doesn't really need to be concurrency safe, since you can be sure that only that one worker will be modifying the standing orders table. The problem with it is of course if the order volume surpasses the speed that a single thread can process the order, it just starts falling further and further behind and there's no way to catch up. 
Agreat start to making it faster would be not using a relational db at all; for example every second there might easily be a million cycles wasted by Mtgox just checking that any given order is owned by a real account. Entirely wasted, because of course they are all owned by someone.

Say the old style addresses go from being hackable in the heat-death of the universe scale time, to being hackable in a hundred years per address.  During this period, as the cryptography is breaking, we can establish a new method of relating new private keys and public keys.  Everyone will be instructed to sign one last transaction moving all of their money from the old-style format to the new-style format.
The lowest common denominator wallet software of the time will probably do this for you with a dialog box, like a software upgrade.  The new public addresses and private keys might be twice as long, which makes them exponentially harder to break.

We should if we are trying to sell Bitcoin abstractly as a consumer payment solution.  Not having a cohesive branding makes bitcoin as a whole look shitty and unprofessional.

Bitcoin is plagued by all of these things and it hurts our consumer confidence tremendously.

I'm not sure you understand the underlying issues. If its a digital/irreversible, just wait for like 6 confirmations. It's almost impossible to double spend at 6, you just need to wait an hour.

This is silly.  You are correct, but there's an obvious flaw:  Lets take November to right now as an example, there was more than a doubling in value. So if you want a 10% return per year, you need to charge -45% interest on your bitcoins, but you need to lend them out to someone with only a finite chance of repaying you.  The thing it's competing against is not loaning your coins out at all, holding them, getting the full 200% per year increase in value at nearly 100% chance.

Well, bitcoin could phase out the old encryption methods.  You could imagine a hard fork where they introduce new, slightly longer public keys that are generated in an entirely different way from new, longer private keys (once it got to the point where you could, for example, mine a public key with a desktop computer in a decade).  We'd have PLENTY of warning, they would just need to release a patched version and a target switchover date, and all of the miners just switch over to recognizing transactions on the new addresses (signed with the new encryption method) on that given date.  We'll already need to do a hard fork at some point to increase the transaction limit.  Supposedly the blockchain only has enough space at the moment to allow about 7 transactions a second, definitely way too low in the long run.

@_date: 2013-05-19 07:28:25
It's also worth noting that the bitcoin protocol doesn't require the escrow 'holder' to actually hold your funds, it can be an N of M transaction, with the normal case being 2 of 3.  If the buyer and seller agree on what happened (ie, successful transaction, they both vote yes, buyer apologizes and backs out of the transaction, they both vote no) the transaction resolves without involving the escrow agent.  Otherwise, the escrow 'holder' reviews the case and sides with the buyer or seller, establishing a majority that way.

I'm not sure if there's a good UI for this though yet.
@_date: 2013-03-11 22:27:41
This is the best solution, as the absolute worst thing the seller can do is trap your money in the æther.  Since you both need to consent that the transaction went correctly, there's no chance of your money being stolen per se, since they can't gain it.

@_date: 2013-03-11 02:42:33
It's kind of moot now, but the shares are bought and sold from other users, you you place a buy order, and then someone else can come in and accept that buy order (and sell to you).  Then you own 1 share and they own -1 share.  They are responsible for putting up the maximum amount they could lose (with the market settling at either $10 or $0), same with you.  
That exact bit I personally thing is awkward and confusing, so I'm actually working on a competitor (or... at this point a replacement) that clarifies that process.  
And of course, runs on bitcoin.  It will use an offline wallet (for amounts beyond the normal expected daily withdraw amount, as a balance of security and convenience) and nightly remote backup, so regardless what happens, the users will always be able to get 100% of their money back.
Incidentally, I'm psyched about this news.

I believe that would completely break colored coins, where you need to assert the entire history of the coin.  So whatever solution you come up with still needs to support nodes that use the current standard policy.
The real solution is off-chain transactions, where providers take on the role of Visa, and can do things like allow chargebacks etc, while also not actually publishing transactions to the blockchain when a member bitcoin user spends coins at a member merchant.
@_date: 2013-12-22 04:43:36
Actually, this was during the blockchain fork that happened a while ago, and this got to 6 confirmations on the orphaned chain.  That's why it's stuck here, it was considered 'real' once.
@_date: 2013-08-27 05:04:56
You can accept zero confirmation transactions.  On par with accepting credit cards without physical card/CVV.

But if the coins get spent somewhere intermediate, there's no way to know if that party was complicit, and we don't want to go down that road of establishing blacklists and punishing anyone that doesn't follow our specific list.

Oh, I didn't realize that.  That makes a lot of sense.   So multiple transactions with outputs at the same address are still entirely separate?  And the colored coin wouldn't be destroyed until you spend it in a single transaction involving multiple inputs?

Almost definitely, but that probably won't happen for a long, long time.  A lot of people have already invested a ton of CPU and brain cycles in trying to break this stuff, and unless quantum computing actually becomes a thing, cracking this stuff is measured generally in multiples of the age of the universe (though it does halve more often than every 18 months.  A general rule of thumb is that any given type of encryption only lasts 10 years).

I believe that when a block is created, that block itself has timestamp, so difficulty can be calculated just by looking at the entire blockchain.

Yes, but that's what difficulty correction is for.  It's not  exactly every 10 minutes.  After every N blocks, everyone on the network looks at how much time it took to create those N blocks, and all agree what the new difficulty threshhold is no make sure it takes 10 minutes on average to find a block.  This isn't quite accurate, but imagine it's more like, every second, there is a .0001% chance of finding a block, and on average, that means one block every 10 minutes.  There are clusters and dry spells (every once in a while, more than an hour with no solution), but over all it averages.

Miners could band together to refuse to accept moving a specific coin, and refusing to build on any blockchain that has moved that pile of coins.  If this is how blacklisting was done, you could just watch for confirmations, and know that once a transaction is confirmed the coins weren't blacklisted.
@_date: 2013-04-28 19:00:19
To change anything in the btc protocol, we only need the consensus of 51% of the miners.  If 51% of the miners believe we need to print more BTC (which they NEVER EVER WILL), then someone will publish a new spec that allows that, and mining clients can be updated to allow that.  Likewise, if the miners agree that we need more precision, or that the current private key-&gt;address system is broken, a new mining client can be written that supports that, and we can all move over to it, preserving the existing network.
This is called a hard fork, and already needs to happen not to far in the future because the block size limits BTC to an average of 7 transactions a second, I believe.
@_date: 2013-08-28 13:28:02
Yeah, that's a good point I hadn't thought of.  Once the block reward settles down and most of the income comes from transaction fees, there's less of an incentive to keep everything sequential and to mine only off of the newest block.  In fact, the further back you mine from, the more total fees you can swallow into your block, it becomes a risk:reward balance that unfortunately doesn't bode well for quickly getting to 6 confirmations.
@_date: 2013-11-08 14:47:24
Well, I guess that depends on what you mean by "own address".  I would argue that the bitcoin spec states you don't "own and address" that you don't have the private key to, but techncially you're right, if you're in the business of melting coins (like this guy was).

... You must be missing something.  A brainwallet is a way to turn a long phrase into a private key.  If at any point later, you come up with that phrase, you should get the same private key.  There is no way to salt this transaction, because there is no other identification.  The only thing you can do is make the brainwallet passphrase more secure.  I know they can collide, but salting 1) doesn't make any sense 2) wouldn't help 3) isn't possible, because there is no way to re-associate the owner of the pass-phrase with the salt used to generate the private key in the first place.

Wait, what?  You can do it with bitcoin.  I think you don't know how fractional reserve banking works.  Banks can't lend out more than the total deposits they have, even if their total deposits are greater than the total real money in the entire system.  Imagine a barrier surrounding all banks within a banking system (which we can just treat as one bank for simplicity sake).  All money movement within this barrier is done via ledger, and all movement that crosses the barrier is done by moving bitcoin.  When 10 depositors each deposit 10 BTC, the bank can immediately lend out 90BTC  or whatever, regarldess of it's inability to manufacture new BTC.  It just tracks the ledger and the IOU.  The lent out money can be paid in wages, and those wages can be redeposited and lent out again, increasing the apparent money supply without actually printing BTC.  Banks can even lend to eachother using just ledgers (though this has some tricky consequences), which just means this imaginary barrier envelops all involved parties instead of separating them.  This is 100% compatible with how bitcoin works.

I think bitcoin accepting LTC will drop the price of LTC significantly.
As difficulty burst of ASICs pushes miners off of BTC, they will end up mining LTC with their GPUs.  Since these miners really want BTC in the first place, any expatriate BTC miner will sell LTC immediately for BTC, and MtGOX supporting both just increases the liquidity of LTC.

To answer the question, all the network tracks is networks and balances, so in your case, account:
1xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxzN9JAfTUWu4Kj 
May have a known balance of 1.
Now, if you generated the private key:
On a non-networked computer, the way the hashing algorithm works means you calculate the public address from it in a non-reversible way, that meaning you can turn private key-&gt;address but not the other way around.
The network does not need to be alerted of this event, it only cares when money arrives at that address (and note that it's perfectly possible to send money to an address nobody has the private key for.  It's difficult to guess a valid but unusable key, but it's possible).
In any case, the private key is then used to generate an outgoing transaction: you say 'I am moving 1 BTC from 1xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxzN9JAfTUWu4Kj to [wherever else], signed 5xxxxxxxxxxxxdDA76MzPL6xxxxxxxxMssSzNydYXYB9KF"  (and note that this doesn't actually reveal the private key, but it is mathematically unforgeable.)
So you need to get the private key back onto the internet in order to move money out of the cold storage wallet, but not to create or accept money into it.

That's not how it works.  Markets are all inextricably linked.  If the price OTC is too far off the exchanges, business moves from one to the other until it's equalized.  Sure, there are some people who will always use OTC and some people always Exchanges, but so long as there are enough people who will use both, they will move to whichever has the better price for the direction they want to trade, and that action equalizes the price.

You could use separate blockchains for each planet and have something that works like smart property to let you trade from one network to another.  I'm not 100% sure of the math, but I know it's possible to trustlessly exchange BTC for LTC (in theory at least).

So you believe that banks print money in real life?  Because they don't. They keep ledgers of debt—which you can just as easily do with bitcoin. The deflation is relevant as well, because there is no reason to accept debt denominated in Btc when you could accept it denominated in fiat and count the inflation as negative interest (which is a great deal for the borrower)
@_date: 2013-10-27 22:35:14

Well, the whole point of the transaction fees is to reach an equilibrium with miners.  It cost a miner very little extra to include any given transaction, so the likely endpoint is likely to sort all outstanding transactions by fee and fit the ones with the largest into the current block.  This sounds completely perfect to me.
Keeping the block reward constant wouldn't necessarily solve the deflation issue, because interest/utility of bitcoin could perfectly well grow faster than mined blocks.  Ask yourself: if that were the case, why has the price of bitcoin (ignoring the recent bubble) increased every month, quite significantly?  There are still 25 new bitcoins every 10 minutes or so, but that can't NEARLY keep up with demand.
That said, deflation isn't BAD, it just means certain things won't make sense in a bitcoin economy.

That's not how difficulty works. What happens is the proof of work gets harder and harder until the solution rate drops down to one block mined every 10 minutes, which is the equilibrium point.  So what this means is you get 50btc/10min divided by your % of the total network hashrate.  The important thing to remember is that the network hashrate will likely double short term, ramping up to probably quintupling in just a few months as the other ASIC providers ship.

It's too easy to burn innocent people, and everyone would need to agree on the precise blacklist.  Remember, even though you can track the tainted coins, after a single transaction you need to consider them innocent.  Assume, for example, that they were immediately cashed out through an exchange and some other user buys into them from real life.

So you're just rejecting the idea of brainwallets then?  Because using a salt means relying on a central database to store salts and hashes behind an authentication wall which goes against the entire premise.
Or.... people could just chose a strong enough passphrase that collision is nearly impossible.  This might surprise you, but if two people go up to the blockchain with the same private key, they can both authorize transactions out of the same address.  Because that's just how Bitcoin works.

So lets run through the actions that got it to this situation, to simplify:
1 buy order at 19  
1 sell order at 20  
9 sell orders at 39  
1 sell order at 40  
So someone must have come in, and immediately bought up the 10 sell orders at 39 or below, meaning the margin between the lowest sell order and highest buy order is suddenly $21.  If you saw the market at this moment, posting a new sell order at 39 isn't going to do anything unless that exact same insane person comes back and buys MORE at that stupid high price.  The natural market wouldn't do it, and there's no way there would be an automatic order to sell to at that price.
Someone would need to actively accept your sell order, which no sane person would do (and I'm doubtful that the 40 swing even happened in the first place, more likely misreporting).

So why are we so excited about the lack of chargebacks? That makes it great for the sellers, but terrible for the buyers, because suddenly there's no recourse if the product was devliered.  Obviously this is 'the point' of bitcoins, but I think it shouldn't be considered a good thing, it should be considered a 'different thing' with it's own set of drawbacks.
Though, I did see something about two-party escrow where if anything shady happens, neither party gets their money.  That's good at least, because it means at best you can be a griefer, not a profitable scammer.

it just dropped from 1200.  Buying at 800 is not before it drops, it's well after.  It's virtually impossible to time the exact bottom, instead think of yourself as 90% correct (At least for now, its since down to 750 and dropping).
@_date: 2013-02-06 03:57:17
That doesn't make any sense, because even if the difficulty is lower, you can just pretend to your algorithm that it's higher (if i understand difficulty correctly, and a solution at a higher difficulty is also a solution at a lower difficulty).

This is a useless answer.  Did supply jump by 500% for a few minutes?  Did demand drop 50% for a few minutes?  No, obviously neither thing.

Wait, do you not know what a brainwallet is?  It's not a key-value stored in a database somewhere.  This is bitcoin.  A brainwallet is just a seed that is hashed in a certain way to give you the private key (and therefore the address) instead of storing the wallet file somewhere.

Since there's a buyback step, I don't really see how that's safer than a centralized system.  I would definitely run it as a centralized server.  I'm trying to figure out how to balance quick, accurate payouts with not exposing coins to theft if the server is compromised.
One interesting aspect I thought of:  There could be two different ways to buy shares.  One way is intrade-style, where you have an account and it pays back to the account.  This way, you could post buy orders and sell orders, and accept buy orders and sell orders.  The other way would be to anonymously post coins to a specific address anonymously, in a way that immediately accepts either buy or sell orders.  Then, in the case of it settling P or N, you either get paid out or not.  I can't figure out a way to trade this type of ownership, so I'm not sure if there would be any demand for it.
@_date: 2013-04-19 06:04:49
Actually, transactions can be registered within seconds, but take minutes to hours to CONFIRM.  It's up to the business how many confirmations make it a 'legitimate' transaction.  Somewhere from 2 to 8, which could be anything from 10 minutes to an hour.

@_date: 2013-03-13 21:09:37
Your second question is trying to apply microeconomic words to macroeconomics, I think you need to rethink it a little bit.
Your first question is also based on a misunderstanding:  The banks only need to hold 1/10 of the money that is being loaned to them, ie, if everyone at once tried to pull all of their money out of banks, 90% of it might be unavailable (tied up in business ventures).  This could work exactly identically in bitcoin.  A bank provides an interest rate on bitcoins, so poeople deposit them.  The bank can then lend out N% Of them (maybe 90%, but since it's not actually a bank it's not bound by the laws that decided that number), and with the interest of those loans pays the users savings accounts.
The problem with that model is the rate of bitcoin deflation.  Assuming bitcoin keeps growing even at a 'modest' 10% a month, that represents the absolute floor of interest that can be charged.  If you took out a loan in bitcoin a year ago and had to pay it back today, you'd have done MUCH better to take whatever shitty credit card offers you got in the mail during that time.  Since charging a negative interest rate doesn't make sense, it also really doesn't make sense to me to take out credit in a deflating currency... just hold onto it and it's already earning you money.
@_date: 2013-03-23 03:32:41
There could be multiple separate networks that each have a short transaction/confirmation time with some longer slower way to confirm transactions between them.  The isolated network might become weaker to a 51% attack, so I'm not sure exactly how that'd work out.
@_date: 2013-08-01 03:20:01
There is a tiny advantage to this.  It's easier to send a small block than a big block, so if you mine a block like this at the same moment as someone who's mined with a lot of transactions, this block will become the canonical one and the other will be orphaned (so the other miner will get no money, and you just lose out on transaction fees).
@_date: 2013-11-25 06:17:52
Unfortunately it could just have a randomly generated key identifying the computer and the payment, and that key is just looked up in a key/value db on a remote server, which returns the private key to decrypt the files.  If they already need to phone home, there's no reason not to go to that point, which means the solution wouldn't be reusable (as it's already been proven that each installation gets its own private key).
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:19:09
And the attacks are local and will apply into the future, they just generate private keys and addresses brute force of all likely/possible phrases.  You could write a script that downloads every book off of X service and samples every sentence/phrase/etc and generates this massive list of wallets you can pull money out of in perpetuity.

Litecoin doesn't do anything magical.  Their mining calculation is abstractly 'CPU friendly' (though there is a way to run it on GPU, but now that becomes their calculation being GPU friendly when the world has ASICs) and their difficulty is tuned to every 5 minutes instead of 10 minutes.  Nothing else is different.

I think this criteria is unnecessary.  You should be able to say "I don't need this particularly soon" for torrent traffic and "I need this right now, but not very much of it" for game traffic.

You can schedule hard forks that wont be backwards compatable.  We are already planning (in an abstract) to increase the block size.  That increase would be incompatible with old miners and clients, so it would be scheduled months in advanced, ie everyone using the .9 client for example would on XX date (or after the Nth block more likely) change from protocol A to protocol B.  This type of transition could easily include increase of precision.  It will be a long time until a satoshi is too large of unit.

So in conclusion, the answer to your question is "you are really out of the loop."

A third criteria that the other poster failed to mention is that it must be impossible to skip ahead mining (ie work on block 4 while block 3 is unsolved ).  Virtually no 'useful' calculation meets that criteria.

casascius private keys?  I think the left few columns look miscut, so he probably took a sheet of scrap to ham up for the camera.

There are some obvious ones like pollution that needs to be cleaned up, but there are also some less obvious ones, like walmart putting a mom-and-pop store out of business.  It's not at all clear if that's actually a global negative externality or not.

This isn't really relevant.  Bitpay doesn't count spends immediately anyway, so there was no gain here.
@_date: 2013-08-28 21:28:52
Yeah, i believe it.  That makes sense.  You need to make sure yours is longer, not just tying.  The point still stands:  too high of a miner fee will slow down confirmations instead of speed them up.  Even if no other miner is successful at orphaning the first winner, they still slowed down the master branch by not mining on it for that ten minutes or whatever, so it takes longer to get from one confirm to two.

The real answer that will start to appear in the coming years is having bitcoin banks that handle the security for you, just as happens with real money.  The only weird thing is that they will probably have to charge a small amount from your deposit to cover their operating cost, since it will be hard to justify making loans denominated in BTC.
@_date: 2013-09-30 02:45:01
I believe the page is sorted randomly every load, and it just causes a reload when you switch to BTC.  Nothing malicious, just trying to be equitable to all of the listed hotels.
@_date: 2013-06-03 05:40:28
What do you mean?
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:55:32
This is a good point.  I don't blame them for not being able to handle the total load, but they prioritized incorrectly.  They are being greedy by letting new users sign up at the cost of supporting current users.

It's just a clone of Litecoin.  It took about 3 days of work to get up and running, and is basically just a continuation of the so shibe meme.

Haha, I didn't mean necessarily btce in particular, but it's fine for a noob to treat his 2fa coinbase account as his 'wallet' until he really learns the ropes of bitcoin, imo.

They CAN leave, right now, just not in dollars.  In any other currency, or Bitcoin.

It's interesting, different senses are logs on different bases.  I saw a chart once of it, but I can't remember the name to look it up again.  Things like length were very nearly linear (ie, something 2.1 times as long looked twice as long or whatever) but sound and light were VERY logarithmic.

There's identical, and there's identical identical.  This was just identical.

Here's the thing though... first of all, people are already proving they are willing to lose money on mining, and second, you can't do anything else with a bitcoin mining ASIC.  It's basically mine or gather dust.  That's a very low bar that needs to be met.
@_date: 2013-08-08 19:21:59
Well, you need three dimensions.   How wide are we talking?  Also at that height, I think you can do the chimney cooling thing, where just the fact that the tower is hot draws fresh air through it up from the bottom.

We need more exchanges. :/ I can start working on one in two months but it wouldn't be done for like 7 months.

But I'm not a libertarian, many users arent. I agree that the 'base' probably is, but don't you think it's a little short sighted to say 'Yes! We are the money of an unpopular political party!'. Rather than something more all-encompassing?

MySQL's decimal is a solid solution, iirc it stores ints for both sides of the radix, completely precise.  You just need to be using a language that has decimal datatype.

How much would it cost to do the attack if you specifically licensed new asics cut from scratch by Nvidia for example?  I highly doubt it would be a billion dollars.

Search volume delta, aka todays popularity - yesterdays (give or take, probably more like the way Reddit does 'hot').

Nah,  highly doubtful. Don't worry about the price of one Bitcoin (that said, now is not a great time to buy)

...?  That's only true because it's not popular.  In no way will it be immune or protected from anything the government does just because 'bitcoin' is the word they use when they describe the 'problem'.

So what happens when bitcoin gets to the verge of being a credible currency for the average consumer, and then payment processors stop allowing mtGox to accept or pay out $?  Bitcoin's liquidity still relies tremendously on banks, unfortunately.
@_date: 2013-03-30 05:51:30
Well, you'd need an easy, quick way to send $ in a P2P way, which is supposedly one of the best consumer-facing aspects of bitcoin.  But for this exchange to work, that has to also be true of $, inherently mitigating some of the superiority of Bitcoin.

And then I noticed, the ASIC was really two stories tall and it was really the loch ness monster.
@_date: 2013-04-08 13:42:50
No, it's not broken, it's just transmuted into 'mineable on GPU and not on ASICs' which is the same principle and becoming more and more relevant.

Yeah, fuck  Google.

Mostly to do with spoofing confidence in peers.  It might be possible to make it look like you are successfully doing a 51% attack, for example.

Bitcoin does not and will not support blacklisting/following coins.  Whos to say they haven't been spent at a legitimate business in the mean time?  Any transaction could be considered innocent, and we can't mandate everyone follow the same specific blacklist.

Huh?  Yeah, they send them to one intermediate address and then cashout.  There's no way to tell if an intermediate address is that same person, or some innocent service.
