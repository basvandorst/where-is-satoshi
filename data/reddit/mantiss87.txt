Wealth redistribution takes time.
@_date: 2019-10-11 16:18:15
Bitcoin is definitely not your best bet for privacy. Someone has your receiving address.
@_date: 2019-10-26 12:45:07
Someone got a taste.
@_date: 2019-10-15 21:46:36

@_date: 2019-10-23 00:24:36
Why would you trust a stranger with any of your money?
@_date: 2019-10-12 15:08:31
It was a scam.
@_date: 2019-10-23 00:35:30

@_date: 2019-10-24 18:43:05
Great fire starter.
@_date: 2019-10-04 19:42:28
Bitcoin isnt anonymous at all tho.
@_date: 2019-10-16 12:45:02
So just like any monetary system. You dont own the money in your pocket its on loan from the central banks.
@_date: 2019-10-10 17:33:59

@_date: 2019-10-07 01:58:59
Losts of wash trading with bots.
@_date: 2019-10-17 00:41:50

This guy gets it.
@_date: 2019-10-17 02:35:25
Try doing that with fiat.
@_date: 2019-10-07 01:55:08
They dont own crypto, i think its just paper trading. Thats why they dont allow withdrawals.
@_date: 2019-12-04 00:24:37

@_date: 2019-12-15 02:14:09
Fast food is poison.
@_date: 2019-12-02 02:57:19
The internet told me too.
@_date: 2019-12-03 12:30:37
The one you own keys too.
@_date: 2019-12-03 14:51:29
If it wasn't for traders the price would be nothing.
@_date: 2019-12-24 02:04:26
Go out to the bars, there filled with lonely chicks this time of the year.
