Wouldn't you be pissed if your bank website was down when you tried to use it or your college servers went down during finals? Be glad it's only a stupid forum with nothing but irrelevant information available elsewhere, trolls and scammers.

Isn't it funny how the U.S. has total control over other countries and arrests people on foreign soil whenever they choose to. Team America world police. Fuck yeah

What do the mining pools have to say about this fork? Are they in agreement? Has anyone flown to China to get their input?

So go make your own forum and try not to ban anyone. Forums are private not public entities. Forums get a lot of kooks as members. Do you spend a lot of time telling your local businesses what products they can sell and what their return policy should be? You know better than they do, right? BCT can ban or not ban anyone they choose to and allow any behavior they want to allow.

Sorry for your experience but it sounds like you spent all of your time in the pier 39 tourist trap. You're right, there's not much Bitcoin activity in that area. If you had stayed in just about any other neighborhood in the city you would have had better luck.

What happened to BTCBuy?

That's right, it's a government conspiracy. Actually, theymos is an NSA agent. He took the forum down because he's on unpaid furlough and can't afford to pay the agents (mods). You crack me up Bruno. lol

No, because even the US government is courteous enough to put up a page that tells you the server was seized. Bitcointalk thinks it's a good idea to just leave a blank page for three days. Fuckin amateurs.

The Cosby hack was funnier than this one.
