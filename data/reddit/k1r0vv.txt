@_date: 2017-09-27 18:54:10
i used them was ok. just use localbitcoins if u can endure the initial verification’s
@_date: 2017-09-28 15:20:39
im not much of a trader, hodler mostly. but i use kraken caz i got verified fast &lt;couple hours&gt;  and binance.
@_date: 2017-09-26 16:33:36
kraken caz is simple and fast
@_date: 2017-09-23 09:31:02
best oneso far:))
@_date: 2017-09-25 15:20:26
i use exodus. mainly caz i exchange btc&lt;&gt;eth into the wallet thr ss, its fast and clean. i would of loved a sms verification security on it or other 2factor security protocol
@_date: 2017-09-27 12:57:53
use only those that have been in the game for 1y+ and have only positive feedback
@_date: 2017-09-26 14:25:17
i like kraken. got my tier 3 verifican done in 3-4hours. when i tried making apoloniex or bitstamp account.. takes weeks to get the account verified.
@_date: 2017-09-23 18:11:48
i’m sure money is no pb for them. plenty of btc under the mattress
@_date: 2017-09-22 16:24:34

btc/eth/all coins now is like a women in labor, we now should see the head! go baby go
@_date: 2017-09-25 15:01:46
lets see it back to 4500 steady first, that’s what i call a win
@_date: 2017-10-14 13:18:30
i bought thr blockchain, they use coinify, it was ok. 300€ limit on card, higher go by bank. u buy once, then, after all is ok they block u for more purchase for 7 days&lt;to see any complains comes back&gt; then u can buy more... kinda weard but is a build trust way
@_date: 2017-09-23 09:35:22
that will only happen if USA ban crypto somehow
@_date: 2017-09-27 11:05:28

u need to go to a wellsfargo branch and deposit the cash according to they’re instructions. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 18:35:01
the crypto world is still young(u will have other oportunities) pay the house and start reinvesting after. 
@_date: 2017-09-26 16:44:47
ya, they’re great. they accept thr bitpay
@_date: 2017-09-29 20:27:38
bitcoin opened everything and due the fact this is only the begging (% of world population, dif. country/continent dif rules etc) all goes generally thr bitcoin. people know about btc 9x%, eth a few and about the rest nothing, until they start to read. its normal...
@_date: 2017-09-27 13:50:34
what country?

@_date: 2017-09-29 20:37:31
if 20$/week is what u can afford (and u truly belive in the movement )at some point in the future you will be happy. if 20$ is the max u can risk (caz u dont truly belive/yet in the idee) dont hit yourself in the mirror in the future, many of us had get rich opportunities, it’s life.
start reading, start asking questions and make an idea of whats all about and stand by it.
personally i think anything can happen, but im 99% into it, and i thing crypto/blockchain tech movement is irrevesible in our lives.
@_date: 2017-09-26 16:19:18

and there...another bitcoin millionare:) GJ man
@_date: 2017-09-27 12:11:30
i dont think u’ll find good % anywhere. i used to buy btc with amazong gc at 65-70%, but that was 2-3 years ago. due the risk of using the gc and probaby a large % of them are bought fraudulent the price is what it is...
@_date: 2017-09-25 13:40:16
anyone can make an adwords account and start adverising. people need to double check where they click, that’s all.
@_date: 2018-07-24 19:11:57

@_date: 2017-09-27 19:03:38

sorts of methods on localbitcoins
@_date: 2017-09-28 09:00:23
just the walls
@_date: 2017-10-21 22:44:41
yes they are, if u have a secured wallet:)
@_date: 2017-10-02 15:33:53
better invest in tokens... my opinion, if you only have 1000 and you want to play with cc. or, wait for a ⬇️ and buy then, should be one as we close to 5k mark
@_date: 2017-10-21 22:43:39
just wait 3-4 more days see what happens
@_date: 2017-10-01 16:00:01
dont get into this game until u own it. its very risky, start doing it small, understand the concept.
@_date: 2018-07-04 16:08:50
so? did your monero chips paid off? i hope u didnt sell 2 early:))
