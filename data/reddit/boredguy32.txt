Sounds more like work avoidance than retirement.  Dude you are 18, get out there and live, get a job and put 10% into your 401k and x% into bitcoin every year.  Think about retirement when you hit 30s.  Too many unknown variables at 18 (will you get married? Have kids? Go to college? Have expensive tastes? Etc etc).  All that changes your retirement goal massively.  At 30 you need 50 years of expenses just to take care of yourself.

This isn't a common thing now.  If bitcoin hits $1M, maybe it will be common but it's not now.  And if BTC hits $1M who is to say their won't be user protections in place by then?  When credit cards first got stolen in 70s / 80s people could use them for months without being traced...now they are usually shut down in an hour before any damage is really done.  I'm not saying that exact process will work for BTC but to get to $1m people need to see protections in place.  You cant have mass adoption without some user and fraud protections.  It's like the wild west now.

6 million wallets have at least 1/billionth of a bitcoin in it.  More accounts = more adoption.  In banking they disregard very low balance accounts to determine the number of active accounts on file...this is something similiar.  It also underscores how early the product is in its development (6 million is good, but still Only 6 million is good too if you are accumulating).  Cheers.

Not true, you don't need rabid consumer spending to have a good economy.  There are many successful countries with high savings rates.  Our economy is fueled by debt consumerism which is like over clocking your PC forever, sooner or later the system burns out.

Probably more the dollar crashing from everyone selling dollars vs a hyper inflation scenario but the net effects are similar so I see the possibility (the difference being actual prices of goods not really skyrocketing)
@_date: 2019-05-29 02:24:10
Not really because if you assume 100% adoption (all wealth in BTC)...then Global Weath ÷ 19 million BTC = the price of bitcoin.  So in my scenario if global wealth was $999T ÷ 19M BTC = a BTC price of about $52M.   
  
(Plus not all global wealth is in currency or soft money so even that is aggressive IMO).

Seems like a huge jump from $1,000,000 in 2021 to Mad Max Thunderdome in 2025.  
  
Global wealth is like $400T.  Lets assume it more than doubles to $999T and it's all in 19M bitcoin then 0.01 BTC is only $500,000...which is only triple the 0.003 what he said an average person has (150,000).  How can you instantly retire on 3x the average person's account?  Global wealth would have to be more than $4,000T for this to begin to make any sense.
