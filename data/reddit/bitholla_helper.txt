I'm not really sure what you're saying. I encourage you to be alert for scams, but this is plain old giving of free bitcoins. We think our app is pretty awesome and we think you'll like it if you give it a shot - that's one of the reasons we're celebrating the season by giving.

We just passed $50, there's still plenty more! Don't miss your chance to discover bitholla and get a buck or so.

Sorry for the delayed response - i missed it the first time. 
Bitholla isn't another payment system. It's not a wallet. It doesn't access your personal information or your private keys. It's a usability layer. Bitholla links people who are interested in bitcoin and abstracts the payment layer so that you see people and names sorted in order of geographic distance rather than bitcoin addresses.
There are no other conditions to receive about a dollar in bitcoin - we just want you to check out the app. There are some minor usability (antispam) conditions  - you must provide a legit GPS location and you have to provide your receiving address. 
The offer is still available for a few hours, it's not too late to try it!

Sorry - the iOS app is a work in progress. We are busily ironing the kinks out of the concept so it will be a smooth launch for our iOS friends!
