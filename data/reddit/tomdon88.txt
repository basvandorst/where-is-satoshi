I have some understanding, I’m not sure many have a full understanding.
Mr Buyer signs a transaction, 
Mr Seller can choose to sign the transaction (at this point unilaterally sending transaction to the block chain) or wait.  
Given Mr Buyer will have needed to decide what fee to pay, 
My question is what stops this being insufficient (and potentially transaction bouncing back after two weeks) had Mr Seller decided to wait (and fees risen).
Please kindly point out where I’m mis-understanding LN if my question is nonsensical.

Yes I will look at this, I guess there is a calc we could do to work out if the payoff is worth it given the risk.  I think it will just be a function of the % of hash available when I get home I’ll work it out.

People can put buy walls up to indicate strength with the hope of giving people the confidence to buy at the current (higher) price as they feel they have a floor price that will limit their downside.
This is then pulled away if the price gets near or touches it.  This happens in stock markets but is illegal in most cases if you are caught, no regulation here, so it’s the Wild Wild West.

Unless they are leveraged!!!

No it does, as they have the next seed (the current valid hash), so they can start blasting through it before anyone else (with a chance of finding it), meanwhile hoping nobody else will find the current hash (which they know).

Cash is for day to day use.  Anybody with money in excess of their next 3 month - 1 year living costs would have been invested in real assets which have returned significantly above inflation since then.
I get that bitcoin doesn’t work as cash, so that leaves investment asset.  But then the comparison is to equities, properties, precious metals, not to the US dollar.
Misinformation IMO.

A lot of very rich people out there, this is a 101 technique which will make you money, it’s called spoofing.  Was made (explicitly) illegal under Dodd-Frank

Warren Buffet is the most famous value investor.  Which basically is the opposite of a BitCoin investor.

The volatility risk doesn’t disappear it’s just passed to another party (who logically will want to be compensated for it).  The key to LN is the spreading of the network fee across multiple transactions, not convinced myself TBH.

I thought Bitcoin was money?
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:53:38
I'd buy at somewhere between 2-3k.

Thanks for letting us know.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:44:18
Cool, I guess you sold some as the price rose?  If so at what price points? And how many?
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:58:46
Most transfers are local and small amounts, ie buy a book, buy a coffee.  This is the point.
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:32:06
Sounds so convenient lol, let’s make the world fit BitCoin that’ll work. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:36:24
How many?

It’s success has hit a mass where some floors in the actual use as a currency have become apparent, if it doesn’t work at least as well as traditional currency then its worthless.  Simple.

Bitcoin won't go to zero, if found worthless it will hang around for foreseeable future with market cap in the tens or low hundreds  of millions, due to novelty value.
In your example you are talking about things which had value, I'm talking about companies that actually go bust, then holders lose.

$150+ is a significant transfer of money in most countries, for such a large amount to be seen as span is problematic.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:34:43
How many did you buy?

Brave to hold.  Good to pay your taxes, honest citizen!

I think you’ll find the ones that lose in everything that ever goes bust are the ones who held.

What is Bitcoin (Core)
@_date: 2019-08-12 14:57:15
Inflation doesn’t effect these people as all of there wealth is in human capital which is inflation linked.
@_date: 2019-08-12 01:26:02
But anybody with more assets than to cover their immediate needs (a month?; a year?) would invest the excess.
For most of the period you describe inflation linked bond had a good spread over actual inflation so in your example you’d have ended up with much more after.
Of course a smart investor will invest in real assets like equity, if you’d done this you’d be miles ahead.

Come on man, don’t just wait 5 years for a pipe dream.  For sure it’s hard out there I agree, I’d suggest taking a look at things like shared ownership, this can be a great way of getting on the property market.
I think you have a lot more power to achieve your goal of owning a house than you think.
