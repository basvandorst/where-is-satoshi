We must admit that the title and the prediction itself are very clickbait, but the content is good. Please take a look at our channel and share your opinion. [

These are in fact bullish news but it doesn't mean we are seeing higher prices nor the bear market is over. At least watch the content before spreading your hate around.

The whole process of buying BTC thru this ATM machine is complicated. You should be able to get a paper wallet out of it stead of the need to go online and redeem your coins. But US laws require KYC, so maybe in the future, it will be possible. People are also complaining about the high price spread and fees. To people that are involved in crypto as we are it doesn't make sense buying from an ATM, but it will surely help crypto adoption.
