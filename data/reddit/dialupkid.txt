I thought I had the seed, but it comes up empty

That's what my post is linked to: 
Now how do I find out what this address (15gb4qoZRy4WYsY1HKCmmA977W7SsuPxJ6) refers to?

Some more info:
- I have a screenshot of the supposed seed on my phone from 30 minutes after the transaction, so I assumed that recovering that wallet would get me to my bitcoins, but this had a balance of zero and no transactions.
- The address that I sent the money from is also mine.

So apparently there is. Any ideas on how to access this?
When I restore my Hive wallet the balance shows zero.

He was referring to a comment made by her trainer/coach who (a couple of months ago) said she has been rising like Bitcoin, because she came out of nowhere to win a European distance championship and qualify for the Olympics.
Considering the fall of Bitcoin since it is actually a pretty good comment IMHO. Especially considering the fact that he is not there to make any substantial or significant remarks concerning Bitcoin but to comment on speed skating.

He was actually referring to a comment originally made by her trainer/coach.
