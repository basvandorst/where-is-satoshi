Yeah I don't actually think it will work out as I suggested. More likely that the wealthy will give just enough to the poor to ensure they are happy enough and that no revolution occurs. Was just a possible nightmarish post-apocalyptic scenario I was considering.

Just to add, even when you connect the hardware wallet to a computer the computer will not be able to access the private key of the hardware wallet.

Centralisation of mining is certainly undesirable and has occurred to quite a large extent. However as long as enough average users are still able to run full nodes and therefore perform validation of transactions themselves miners will not be able to pull off an attack without being easily detected and hence they are incentivised to follow the rules.

I had thoughts along the same lines but of a much more dystopian nature... Imagine if robots are capable of doing all human work much more cheaply and therefore people are no longer able to sell their labour.
Those who own the robots will become incredibly wealthy but those who don't won't be able to find employment and would be totally destitute.
Assuming no UBI (after regulatory capture by the wealthy) this would lead to a totally polarised world of rich and poor.

Presume you are talking about a hardware wallet? That is a small device which holds private keys that never leave the device even when it is connected to your computer. Thus it is safe from hackers who may compromise your computer but is still easy to interact with compared to say a paper wallet.
Google Ledger nano s for a good example

1. It is cheaper to buy directly from gdax rather than coinbase. After that I'd recommended to transfer them to a hardware wallet that you have set up- e.g. nano ledger s
2. Multiple transactions to a single paper wallet is fine if you decide to go down that route
3. You can import the paper wallet but at that stage you are relying on your computer not being compromised. Hence the hardware wallet recommendation to be extra safe
4. That is a sensible idea

Schnorr signatures and MAST are two scaling proposals that will directly improve the base layer scaleability. 
Worth also pointing out that wider improvements in bandwidth/processing/storage will also be seen over time which will allow blocksize to be ultimately increased without impacting centralisation.

Every full node (including Jameson Lopp's) validates every block.
Even if a miner with &gt;51% network hashpower released a block that didn't abide by the rules of the protocol the other full nodes would still deem it invalid and therefore the block would not be accepted by the wider network

You also have to take into account the fact that the $100,000 ends up being loaned out multiple times as it will increase the reserves of another bank allowing them to make further loans. And as you say it is only paid back at some time in the future, by which time a further number of loans have been made increasing the supply by much more than the interest on the initial loan.
It is a fact that loans by commercial banks increase the money supply. They actually create the majority of money in the economy. You only need to refer to something like this from the Bank of England to see this - e.g. page 16 of this report...

On re-reading yes you are correct. I misinterpreted what he meant by 'this' in the third sentence.
Regardless, still think it is worth exploring. Would just need to take into account any additional cost in latency/CPU computation and weigh it all up holistically.

This is a fallacy. If energy costs fall with the introduction of cheap renewables, this will actually cause more energy to be devoted to Bitcoin mining (giving the same amount of overall expenditure).
Miners will expend as much energy as is profitable to mine a Bitcoin. If the price of Bitcoin is $10,000 then miners will find it profitable to spend just below $10,000 to mine one. If the the cost of energy falls by a factor of 10 they will just expend 10 times the energy but still the same amount of money overall.
A move to proof of stake such as is being attempted by Ethereum is a solution to the energy expenditure problem though.
@_date: 2017-11-06 11:48:37
I disagree here.


If you could eliminate the duplication you could scale by more than a factor of 2. By sharing data through the propagation of transactions you are spreading the load continuously over time, rather than in a bursty fashion as happens when a block is propagated. Similar to the idea behind pre-consensus based approaches.

That's the only thing you need to worry about. If it's not there in your wallet then he either didn't send it or sent it to an incorrect address. Both his issue not yours.
Check your address balance on a blockchain explorer to be sure it's not just an issue with your wallet client (which might not be properly synced for example)
@_date: 2017-09-21 12:09:34
If you want to keep the payment as bitcoin, just create a wallet on your computer (recommend electrum). Then once you have created your address give that to the person paying you. Get him to deposit bitcoin to that address, after he does this wait a couple of confirmations to make sure the transaction can't be reverted and then you can hand over whatever he is buying.
Caveats... you need to be sure the computer you create your wallet on is not compromised. And make sure you back up your private key (think it is a seed in electrum's case and password) and don't share this with anyone. If it is a lot of money recommend getting a hardware wallet to store the funds

It's called a hardfork. It's not that complicated. Other blockchains do them all of the time in order to improve their protocols. A compromise between the two parties would make it non contentious rather than the possible contentious one that we are currently heading towards.

I can see he expected centralization to a certain degree as you describe. However I don't think he expected GPU/ASIC mining which have significantly raised barriers to entry for mining compared to the cost of just buying servers. I wouldn't be so concerned if people could spin up servers and CPU mine, they are much more ubiquitous than ASICs

Creating a paper wallet offline makes it a bit trickier. And you are still at risk if the computer you are using is compromised, you still need software to create a paper wallet. Feel free to detail your approach though...
@_date: 2017-09-21 15:28:18
To cash out you could sign up to an exchange or alternatively could go via local bitcoins.
If the payment really is for a lot and you are a bit lost with how things work then it's probably not worth risking it in my opinion (unless you know the guy paying is trustworthy). Definitely worth dipping your toes into bitcoin though and once you get your head round some of the basics (e.g. security, wallet backups, confirmations, fees) you will be good to go

Since when did bumping the block size become a complicated change!? The required client testing is tiny. The unknown is its impact on the network and the potential centralisation implications. Also by supporting a non core developed 2X implementation you are effectively advocating an ousting of the current core developers who to their credit appear more credible than alternatives.
Regardless I share your sentiments in terms of compromise. If one side wants 1mb and the other wants 2mb, then just do 1.5mb and move the fuck on with more interesting things... The network will not implode at any of those block size values.

It was the departure from:
*miners are economically incentivised to have bitcoin's interest at heart* (Satoshi) 
*miners are big companies who may not have bitcoin's interest at heart despite the built in incentives* (Core) 
that I struggled to wrap my head around. I think I get it now though.

What do you mean by hop?
\&gt; Assume for a second two nodes that are connected via 10 different hops; only 1 out of the 10 has sufficient funding to route the payment. The metric will report that 10&amp; of those routes are able to route that payment. But as long as that 1 route is available and has enough funding, 100&amp; of payment attempts would go through.
This seems to suggest you consider it as an end to end route that is made up of a sequence of channels
@_date: 2018-07-03 14:28:22
and later on when you talk about routing probability improving with the number of hops, do you also mean it in the same sense? I'm not sure your definition of a hop is aligned with what most people would expect it to be, i.e. the number of payment channels that need to be sequentially navigated in order to reach the end target.
May be worth bearing in mind for future updates. Regardless, appreciate the work putting some stats against the network!

Ethereum issuance will be greatly reduced with the move to PoS consensus.
If enough support was gathered within the Ethereum community you could implement a hard cap or even a halvening type approach identical to Bitcoin. These things aren't set in stone, but set in line with the wishes of the majority partaking in the network. It just so happens that in Bitcoin the 21 million total supply has been widely agreed up front so that the majority are in favor of sticking to that parameter.
@_date: 2018-07-06 15:23:50

It's more a case of editing the ledger to undo the DAO payouts that undermined the future security of the platform. Having around 5% of the Ether supply in the hands of an obviously malicious actor was not a good thing for a platform with ambitions to transition to proof of stake consensus. 
The majority of the Ethereum community supported this as can be seen by the relative market values of ETH vs ETC after the fork. I'm sure personal interests were probably also involved for some, but I think the reversal can be justified from a platform security perspective alone and this decision was made easier by the fact that it was relatively straightforward to implement (given the impacted coins couldn't be tumbled/mixed as they were still locked up in the DAO contracts).
It's a matter of culture, Bitcoin advocates for absolutely zero intervention arguing that it is a slippery slope towards more and more intervention made for ever more subjective reasons. Bitcoin Devs also want to argue to lawmakers that they are not responsible for what goes on the blockchain and have no power to change it. I see value in this approach and hold Bitcoin accordingly.
Ethereum generally follows an approach of no intervention but made an exception in a case where on balance the pros of intervention seemed to outweigh the cons of inaction. I see value in this approach also and as an Ether holder supported the actions of the Devs. It should be noted that I would not support equivalent action on the Bitcoin chain as Bitcoin embodies for me a different stricter ideal and a different value proposition.
