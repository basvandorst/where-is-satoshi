Computers are used for child pornography... do we ban those as well? How about USD? I bet its been used to purchase child pornography, do we get rid of that as well?

You are an idiot. Not being bitter but seriously. You can't actually understand this and think it has any validity right?
@_date: 2018-03-30 23:30:10
3 week old account and tossing shade. This kinda stuff does matter.  
@_date: 2018-03-29 04:48:43
I mean... no not really. I like the tech and I think it will be the future of currency. I dont really care about which one works as long as it works better than the system we have in place now. But still I have a dog in the race so to speak in bitcoin so of course I want it to do well.
@_date: 2018-03-30 14:21:32
Hahahaha. Thanks I needed that.
@_date: 2018-03-29 14:52:13
Lol oh you're a kid. Gotcha.
@_date: 2018-03-23 22:57:03
It definitely could go either way.
@_date: 2018-03-29 03:38:54
I think cryptos are the future of money but the jury is still out if bitcoin will be king later.
@_date: 2018-03-29 03:41:08

@_date: 2018-03-19 00:30:27

@_date: 2018-03-24 22:10:09
Sorry you lost...
@_date: 2018-03-23 18:19:46

Middle to upper white college kids.
@_date: 2018-03-29 03:42:37
Haha the voters seem to disagree with you.
@_date: 2018-03-29 01:17:05
I think the volume of traders will sway the fud somewhat yes.
@_date: 2018-03-30 03:33:16

@_date: 2018-03-21 16:07:08

@_date: 2018-03-29 17:56:38
@_date: 2018-03-19 02:43:14
How? My money is secured. Burned would be not selling for a profit then biying back in after another dip. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 03:40:20
Man oh man some of the people in this sub are reaaalll bitter. 
@_date: 2018-03-25 22:55:44
Yeah that was a good one. Hoping the rebound will be big.
@_date: 2018-03-29 14:23:16
You never got money when you came home for easter from college? Your parents didnt give you anything to help finish out the year? I had 2 jobs in college and i still needed help. All I am saying is that college kids are taking money from their families who gave it to them for expenses or whatever and are investing in bitcoin. Shit they are using money from student loans to invest. And sure it doesnt seem like alot but a few millions students do that and yes it effects the market. Its not an outrageous idea and all the little butthurt cryptos in here that wanna blame whales for every dip can go on bitching about how they dont have any money because the whales are taking it. Anonymous internet conversation is so ridiculous. 
@_date: 2018-03-24 14:43:54
Fomo is real today.
@_date: 2017-10-22 17:43:45
If you cannot afford to lose any money then you should stay away from trading and crypto.
@_date: 2018-03-28 23:07:23
I hope this is the bottom but im still unsure. Im thinking people will invest after easter with it being such a younger market and college kids are getting money for easter and instead on saving it throwing it at crypto. But its just a guess.
@_date: 2018-03-29 13:09:41
A did your grandparents not love you? 
@_date: 2018-03-23 04:33:36
Its pretty crazy around here for sure. Just seems alittle extra lately.
@_date: 2018-03-26 12:32:28
Remind me in 1 week.
@_date: 2018-03-21 14:41:42
Whales are about to dump I say. Mostly because i want some sub 7500 coins to buy before we head to the moon.
@_date: 2018-03-24 01:01:20
No one knows if it will go up or down. Here is what i know. Its close to the top it has been in a week or so. And the weekend is coming where the last 3 weekends have been dropping prices. I just sold. But thats just my non educated guess, same as everyone else in here. Only trade what you can lose.
@_date: 2018-04-03 04:17:35
Something did. Sweet jesus someone is otm right now with some dough. Fun times. 
@_date: 2018-04-03 04:25:16
Wait what? &lt;1% isnt cheap enough? 
@_date: 2018-04-06 12:31:57
Wtf did i just look at?
@_date: 2018-04-02 02:12:15
Calm and hold on. Hopefully this bitcoi. Thing turns out well in the next 5-10 years and you will get your money back plus some. Hopefully!
@_date: 2018-04-04 20:14:12
Isnt betting what we are all doing anyway? 
@_date: 2018-04-04 14:46:52
@_date: 2018-04-04 20:28:49
In december there were a few. They mostly just hang around this sub and talk about how bitcoin is dead now.
@_date: 2018-04-03 12:28:17
