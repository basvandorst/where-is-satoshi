1) fight the Power
2) you'll be techie cool AF
3) some places will still offer discounts for using BTC
4) HODL some - massive potential returns (or zero, that's the way the crypto-cookie crumbles)
5) never forget about 1)

Sooo, props out on being 15 and turned on son.  Great  you're interested in mining but unless you simply want the experience at the $100 mark it's just not worth it.  2 years ago I did the same w/ $120 and made my monry back in dollar terms but would have made more money if I simply had held the BTC for a year.  Checkout the mining payout calculators - it's just not worth it you'd have to spend probably thousands to worth bothering (at some risk as the difficulty increases).   Buy the BTC and HODL!

It comes with good instructions (you'll find one of articles about it too). Basically buy your BTC wherever (Gemini, coinbase, strangers in dark alleyways with localbitcoins etc), use some to buy direct from trezor.io (pay more to get it from them in Europe, don't get from $AMZN, just to be safe) then transfer the remainder to your shiney new Trezor (but only after enjoying practice wipes/restores with $1's worth first of course).

Glad to be of service ;-)  I was thinking the reason you wouldn't use coinbase.com is cos no way to use it to *buy* Bitcoin at your age (ACH in etc).  I don't' see any reason why you can't use it as a wallet though (my 15 yr old daughter has an account I send her fractional BTC sometimes).  Either coinbase.com or blockchain.com (the first has better UI, the second more detailed UI/more access to stuff but quirkier).  Both of these are well respected, I've use them both for &gt; 10 mons with no issues and being online don't have blockchain sync issues.
One other possibility if you want to be 'all local' (pure client side via Chrome extension/javascript) is  - just be real sure and careful to back it up because if anything happens on your PC your wallet's lost.
Seriously get a coinbase.com wallet and a blockchain.info one and split your funds (however bit of small) between them - that's plenty hedging.  Also use TFA (two factor authentication) and I'd even recommend authy.com (so the tokens are securely backed up if you're phone dies/gets lost).
Go for it!
Edit:  as someone else mentioned and despite what I said about the coinbase ToS does state need to be 18 - interesting how I never noticed that signing up for accounts (not did my daughter!).  Doubt you'll ever have a problem but if you want to play it super safe I think you're fine on blockchain.info ( is as much of a ToS that I can see there).

Dan and Jeremy do an **outstanding** job evangelizing, user grouping, knowledge sharing and just generally spearheading the push for Bitcoin/crypto at MIT and well beyond - can't say enough good things about these guys.

"Academicians, comrades and friends!

"The ancients said: “People must love themselves, but later people love them; people must respect them and they respect them.” We hope that the majority of academicians will be able to raise their uprights, cultivate and practice the core values ​​of socialism, and adhere to academic titles of academicians.

Nope, disagree.  Want to know how many times code scan has worked for me at Starbucks for the last at least 3 years many times a week?  Probably 99% of the time.  Whereas I get no end of problems w/ NFC on GoogWallet at places that accept that (like major retailers with non-shitty equipment like CVS).
OK granted you said BT-LE and maybe that's more reliable but it's irrelevant, noting beats the optical scan KISS of things like QRCodes AND as others have pointed out, it's automatic enough while still being intentional enough.  It's really the best middle ground.

Welcome, stick around for the learning and ride.  Take it one day/week/mon at a time there's a HUGE amount to digest.  I know, I was shocked when I first encountered BTC 1.5y ago - even the tech part was a lot to take in (and I'm technical).  I've learned and am learning SO much still!
Try things out, read, have fun, share!
Some quick simple suggestions:
- get a wallet at a few places (it's all free ;-)) ... web: coinbase.com,  blockchain.info, desktop: Electrum and try transferring some BTC between them - just a little, pretty hard to get burned but even if you do no biggie right ?
- listen to the blockchain  - throw them a donation ;-)
- write a short msg 'into the blockchain' ex:  (hint, use CSV export and bring it into Electrum on the desktop)
- spread the word,  is esp great for this on social media, and  makes great tip cards just to hand out IRL.

I use a **lot**, I like it's functionality, it's one of the top 2 ways I spread the gospel about BTC.
My only big concern is how are they going to monetize, it costs $$ to run AWS infrastructure (or whatever they use) - I have no prob w/ 1% withdrawal fee and would even be fine w/ some advertising if that would help.

I pinged blockchain support and in fairness they seemed pretty candid when I asked them pointed Q's about if the was a published solution to decrypt the wallet.aes.json and if not what was the target ETA for when there would be again: 
"This a current issue being gone over by the development team and we are hoping to have a solution soon, maybe by the end of next week. But yes there is currently no client available to decrypt offline. In the meantime you can import files here;  Hope this helps a little in the meantime, please be patient we are working on a more permanent fix."

With respect, I see your point but disagree, I think a lot of folk even the more tech inclined like this bunch, supposedly, will sometimes need to hear about crypto/Bitcoin 3 or 4 times from different people/places before they start to be more open and take it seriously, every 'failure to convince' is just one click closer to the 4 times needed.

Or did U mean this:
We have been hacked.
Nobody is in danger, no information has been leaked, and server access was never obtained by the attacker.
Our initial investigations indicate that a vendor exploited a recently discovered vulnerability in the Bitcoin protocol known as "transaction malleability" to repeatedly withdraw coins from our system until it was completely empty.
Despite our hardening and pentesting procedures, this attack vector was outside of penetration testing scope due to being rooted in the Bitcoin protocol itself.

Just be yourself, if necessary be a little extra nice, spend a little more money for nice environs maybe- she'll appreciate it, but don't overdo it.
Relax, have fun, no pressure, get to know someone for a few hours, that alone can be interesting enough of course.

- chicks super dig it (and if you're a chick, substitute dudes)
Minor other reason:
- cryptocurrency is inevitable (you can search for the Google guy's quote), get on the bandwagon early and learn - knowledge is power
- what you don't know you don't know, if nothing else you'll quickly become a big fan of various bits of tech like TFA (and authy.com for extra points here)

Hi Michael, interesting stuff indeed.  One Q that I couldn't' glean the answer from on your website (excuse me if I missed it) - how does CoinSafe monetize in this model ?

It may or may not be 'cute' but it is true.  I'm not saying your interpretation is untrue, there's always room for more analogous interpretations. As such it's not an arbitrary choice. That all said, O'Reilly might do well to encompass a few more domains into their cover art namespace to give themselves more choice in analogizing.

TBH I torrented it down last night (then ChangeTip'ed  and watched it w/ my wife.

She enjoyed the movie, said she learnt a lot and even recognized various bits like the Casascius coins (first thing I bought with Bitcoin, oddly).
Many have reported similarly positive partner experiences (the guys are engaging in the movie and cleverly include bits of family stuff - theirs and other) so I'd say your chances are ~~good~~ great with yours!

OK, sorry OP just a little fun with you ... as for currency, that's a little tougher.  Something that's basket case enough for BTC fluctuation to be better than the previous alternative but smart and not corrupt enough to have the legislative will to get the conversion done.

Well, son, sorry to hear your Mom doesn't seem to supportive ... "there's no need to argue, parents just don't understand" (sometimes).
Next up congratulations on having the intelligence and gumption to be about the work of acquiring, using and understanding cryptocurrency - you're on the bleeding edge here.
What would I do?   I agree coinbase is the best but not an option open to you.  I would say find a local Bitcoin group via something like  ... go along to the meetings (usually a coffee shop or whatever) ... pretty sure there'd be some folks there plenty happy to sell you some Bitcoin and it's probably a fairly trustworthy demographic.  They'll even prob explain about confirmations and such (get 3 to be pretty safe) and the context is such that you can buy and wait for the confs while you sit around and chat etc. (i.e. not weird or awkward most likely fun and educational).
Good luck though I don't think you'll need it!  Option extra credit:  once you have some consider sharing a little of the value with people you care about or you think could use understanding BTC using something like bctip.org
Edit/addition:  if there's no decent Bitcoin meetup group near you, I think you could try going this way - [money order]( to CampBx.com, I can vouch for CampBX being reliable - I've bought coins there in the past (though only when they accepted dollar Xfer from Dwolla).

Frankly, they were the first exchange I created an account at way back in Mar '13 but it took so long to get verified there that by the time they did I already had coinbase.com and not long after CampBX.com (which was awesome until $hitty Dwolla stopped playing the game).
Just never needed Gox and I have no idea why people keep coins at exchanges rather than cold storage or at least somewhere like coinbase that concentrates on being an online wallet.

It's a lot like coinbase.com - arguably an even cleaner UI (simple/stupid/clean) and slightly cheaper BTC purchase fees (they say 0% but it's really more like 0.5% after the BTC price uplift compared to coinbase.com which is 1%).
They don't do merchant services yet but you can bet that's coming one they finish nailing and GAing the 'wallet'.
They have plenty of VC funding and quite a lot of people so I'm sure they have a few tricks up their sleeve too like potentially smart contract stuff and a lot of other things in due course.

To the HODLers the victory ... pleasure HODLing with y'all
@_date: 2015-05-28 22:59:53
I'll take a stab ...
1) Depends - there's lots of trade-offs in complexity (where you might mess up access to them ;)) versus convenience/security but not fully in your control between on-PC and online possibilities.  To keep it simple to start I'd prob recommend online wallet to most like coinbase.com or circle.com (blockchain.info if you can handle less friendly UI in return for owning the private key)
2) def coinbase.com or circle.com wallets with an ACH link to your bank account (assuming you're OK w/ that) else Bitcoin Meetup (usually someone happy to sell you some) and/or localbitcoins.com
3) Sure - historically but not where near so volatile recently - see for yourself ;-) Also could be worth *more* of course ;-) 
4) No that's not the main M.O. but it's coming, xapo.com might do something like that right now (I forget the detail) but I'm sure it costs somehow.  For $20 dont' worry about it - pick one of the online wallets I've mentioned and you'll be just fine (let's just say I've had rather more than $20 thru many of them and no issues to date - let's not talk about mtgox.com - that was the only real big fustercluck).
Jump in, buy something, tip something (changetip.com), donate somewhere (eff.org), play w/ something ( - lots to get your feet wet with that doesn't cost much and you'll learn a fair amount quite quickly and be in a better position to understand more of course ;-)

BTM's (Bitcoin ATM) are your friend. Yes all ask for identity but use one that just wants to verify SMS and get a burner number from smsprivacy.org (cheap, short term, no identity need ;-)). I know for sure this works fine on "MetroBTM".   and it's smartphone app is a great BTM locator!
Yes it costs a bit more, but lack of identity isn't free and plenty worth it IMO ;-)

$150 bucks worth, sure, coinbase'll happily give you BTC for that.
Bitcoin is divisible to 8 decimal places and add time goes on you can keep moving the decimal point to the left as to the minimum anyone is likely to be fine with selling you.

Yes the last chance to deny is Mon. Really makes you wonder after 3+ years and several extensions what possible information could the SEC be processing between now and Mon that could really matter. I.e. of it's a deny any wait until Mon?

you sound impatient, that's OK I respect impatient to a degree.  if you use coinbase you can avoid the B.S. 3 day  deposited in your bank account thing and just give them your user/pass then immediately change your pass (OK, not the greatest  in the world but you can prob trust them for a 10 sec confirm and get your coinbase acct connected right away(.

OK I'll bite:
1) No - BTC is 101% fungible
2) most alts are separate blockchains, there's a "merge mining" concept like for Namecoin but that's pretty much passe.
3) It's a largely predictable (yet dynamic) milestone in the life of mining Bitcoin - no less, no more.  It's part of the slow, measured, dynamic changeover to fees instead of 'block rewards' for doing 'blockchain clerical work' 
4) I don't use Trezor but private keys don't change

I feel ya brah. I can't take the pain away, you need to process it the way you know best but I promise you (non condescending) that while that may seem like a lot of �� to you now later in life you'll deal with even more (investments, car, house, marriage/divorce etc).
We all just need to factor in our experiences ('wins' or not) and move forward, feel bad for a bit to process then realize you have had a unique experience for your age, a truly awesome story (irrespective of whether you are 100K up or down) and clearly a huge will to experiment and learn. It's one of the best muscles you'll ever exercise. Just make sure you learn from it (you be the judge of what that is of course).
Last thought from an old timer (me!) with a tao slant: no snowflake ever falls in the wrong place.

It's Japanese people, don't even think of trying to rationalize it in Western terms. Bitcoin is 'gaigin' for most Japanese (forget the Nakamoto thing, doesn't help). Most gaigin stuff that isn't classic is like a crazy zoo for Japanese, they need to repeat it that way with some semblance of orchestration by the token Japanese woman.
OK, that is all.

Know when to fold 'em

There'll be time enough for countin'
When the dealin's done
Heh, well anyways, you got one hell of a story out of it son and truth is:

Son (or daughter as the case may be), you have been learning lessons worth more than the monetary 'value' you lost, as the old Kenny Rogers number goes: you gotta know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em, know when to walk away, know when to run ...
Bottom line, wear your past crypto experiences as a badge of honor and go forward boldly in crypto and life. Maybe try holding a lot more and longer but never give up experimenting and risking things, find your comfort level with it and ROCK ON!!!

@_date: 2016-12-11 15:42:55
Exactly, I second getting a Trezor at anything &gt; 0.5 BTC level, and as nastypoker said, seed words are UR friend, 1st thing I did was practice restoring 0.001 BTC loaded on my Trezor in Mycelium until I was comfortable and had personally documented how to do it.

If you just want to be a cyber stud-muffin and be able to show the girls $XBT in your Airbitz phone wallet just buy a little now (they'll think 0.00335214 is impressive- it's just about the bling anyway).

Excellent, c'mon in from the cold bro, few pointers:
1) much as I'd prefer "BitCoin", it's "Bitcoin" (aka BTC aka $XBT)
2) If you have more than a few hundred $'s worth of $XBT you should get a hardware wallet and get the hell out of coinbase (any exchange or anywhere else where you don't own the private keys exclusively).
Mainly HODL it but also spend/tip some - be a BTC playa!

I used Gemini for a decent about of BTC acquisition just below $1K and sign up was fast, support was responsive (I had no problems, I was just probing by asking questions ;-)) and all my purchases over a week and a half worked perfectly. Especially liked their 'instant ACH' though limited to $500/24h. I'd used coinbase since they existed and they are ok, no instant ACH and when the market is hot they tend to go down unclear why. Never lost $ there but Gemini was the better experience.
Yeah both are decently VC backed probably decent enough security BUT remember don't leave BTC at any exchange a second longer than you have to. If your don't control the private keys is not your BTC, is the government's and you could get frozen for all sorts of dumb reasons, a lot of times false positive AML firing.
If you are investing &gt;$500 I'd recommend getting a hardware wallet. And if those of recommend Trezor.
@_date: 2017-04-20 16:17:00

Your Personalized Apology Letter
Dear Craig Wright,
I’m sorry, I know those two words are not enough to make this better or win you back. That’s not why I’m writing this. I want to tell you that I now see how much I hurt you and how wrong I was.
I let my ego get the better of me and I see how that was the worst possible thing I could have done.
Do you remember when DO you remember when you completely fucked up cut/pasting code into one of your lofty CompSci papers?. That’s when I knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that I wanted you in my life.
I can only hope that for all of these reasons you will feel that our relationship is worth saving. Please know that I get it now. When I shut my eyes and imagine how I would feel in your shoes, I completely understand your reaction. It is a big deal and my heart is breaking just thinking about it and I just can’t believe how much pain I’ve caused you.
I love you so very much Faketoshi, and I understand that I will have to live with your decision. Please come back to me.

Maybe on being too hard, CHS have plenty of Bitcoin to unload, much as there are gaigin issues with them in Japan, if there's enough incentive merchants could benefit (though many never got stung by CC cos there's such a low use of that in Japan to start with).

Not going to happen, can't do this legally as a business entity without being an MSB which costs a lot per state and comes with AML/KYC info gathering responsibilities. Don't have this? FinCEN will shut your sorry a$$ down fast.
You can do these potentially without ID :
1) localbitcoins.com .. meet strangers in dark alleys or Starbucks preferably.
2) BTMs (Bitcoin ATMs) ... tends to be ~7% ish commission rates though. Also need to find one that accepts Virtual phone numbers (they do an SMS check to avoid scanning licence) then use smsprivacy.org for a burner # purchasable with (darknet mixed) Bitcoin. Exciting enough?!
3) Some other brokering sites like paxful.com teetering on the edge of legality. Of course you get better rates of you give ID but many sellers won't insist. Then you're down to trusting them too even if they have good ratings.
So, yeah. If so BTM route if you're ok with not a great rate and are prepared to do some work for your privacy/anonymity. Otherwise, totally gemini.com over coinbase.com for mainstream usage giving over ID.
Have fun.

I'd say use an exchange or whatever to get BTC first and/or use an online wallet like blockchain.info - small amounts like &lt; $100 - play around, get some experience with it.
After that and if you intend to hold &gt; $1K definitely use paper (very cheap/very secure but possible to screw up if you don't know what you're doing also not very flexible) or hardware wallets (still very secure but very convenient).
 is all you really need to know.

In the end prob an unfortunate reflection of the fact that usage is still too low and training to accept BTC even if fairly 'minimal' is still a thing and not worth it esp when there's not fixed staff like in a lot of businesses.

Right, so the Trezor, by default doesn't show the option for a passphrase (i.e. multiple wallets).  If you enable it that's cool and you can then have multiple wallets with ex: a lot in one, a little in another in case you are ever challenged to disclose your hoard (in which case you'd choose the one with a little of course).
However, the very fact that a passphrase prompt is shown is too much info - better to enable passphrase in order to create your 'large store' wallet and afterward disable the passphrase input so it doesn't even look like multiple wallets exist (I don't think there's any way to tell w/out lots of internal knowledge which would prob take a lot of analysis).

I think the custom tokens (monikers whatever people call 'em) are cool but I also sometimes use "$1 in Bitcoin" when appropriate. It's just an option.
Also, there's one very simple guideline I use to avoid any of the issues you mentioned - just remove " from any RT/quote or any kind of tweeted text if that text is not intended to tip anyone - that way not possible for the string accidentally cause a tip.

Yes the only reason to mine 'small time' is for the hands on experience, it makes little to no sense economically.   I did this w/ USB Block Erupters back in the day (1.5y ago) ... they made back the purchase price in $ terms but not BTC terms.
@_date: 2015-03-30 06:04:53
That tends to be the way with some new establishments ... seen it time and again at restaurants newly accepting BTC - the marketing is ahead of the know how on the ground.  When this happens, if I have time I try to be helpful/guiding, persuading them to find 'the guy that knows something about it', guiding him thru the system - Bitpay app or whatever in order to conduct the transaction.

Fair comment :) I was just having a little fun at your expense, sorry. Now I owe you! So, the bottom line is noone knows even pretty smart chartists etc. The real question is unless you like rolling the dice on day trading, can you be in for a lengthy anyone if time, 3-5 years, say. If so, now is pretty likely to be more then fine time to get in. In 3-5 it's either worth a lot more or nothing. That's all I got. 
Oh expect, you might find out you're in it for much more than the monetary value. But that's a much bigger story.

Well technically I think you mean don't allow installation (not generally anyway) from 'Unknown sources' i.e. can just install a .apk file outside of Google Play control.  This functionality and potential vulnerability exists on stock Android, you don't need to unlock/root to get it.
That all said, I would agree that for most security conscious folks best practice would probably be to use a different account with minimal value for use via smartphone apps just to keep the attack surface area as small as possible.

Hmm, I see your point and I suppose on reflection, I do agree somewhat.  Not to make it super personal about Austin and Beccy but I don't think they did the project because they were big into the Bitcoin Way (whether that's good, bad or indifferent). If they end up having a significant 'profit' it would be great if they could contribute a fair amount of it to the continued success of BTC - how about endow an independent Nobel Prize of Bitcoin "The Life on Bitcoin Award" or somesuch LOL.

Especially if someone sounds as interested in the tech details of BTC as you do I usually give this advice:
Don't hesitate, just jump in, start small, even if it's just with $10 on coinbase.com - you will learn a LOT by doing and reading this forum and others (as well as safe respected sources like   What you will learn about the big picture of crypto-currency and the potential new world order (yes really!) as well as some small practical details like two-factor-authentication etc will be worth whatever you spend as a small cost of admission alone.

Yep, see: [Authy's dev pages]( "We use industry standard secure algorithms (HMAC RFC 4426) and 256 bits keys which are always encrypted at rest."
This means the data kept on their servers is securely encrypted (ex: like the way lastpass.com etc. works) so they neither they nor any potential hackers could make use of it.
I've had several interactions w/ their support and am impressed with their speed/smarts.  I've also been using the app for ~10 tokens for the last 6 mons including several ROM wipes and resets on my phone - it's all been working very well.

Private registration on the domain so can't be sure but the 'About Us' does seem to suggest it's a Fed site - anyone got any other analysis on this ?
Some features that are desired increasingly by end users are generally lacking in many legacy 
payment systems, such as –
* A real-time validation process assuring the payee that the payer’s account exists and it 
has enough funds or available creditto cover the payment;
* Assurance that a payment will not be returned or reversed;
* Timely notification to the payer and payee that the payment has been made; 
* Near-real-time posting / availability of funds to both the payer’s and payee’s accounts; 
* Masked account details, eliminating the need for end users to disclose bank account 
information to each other.
Payment cards and wire transfers possesssome, but not all of these features; check and ACH
payments generally lack these features

2) if you're feeling generous print up some tip cards ( - even 10 for equiv of $1 probably won't break the bank.  Use them to inform as you give them away - you'll learn a lot by figuring out how to interest people and help your other coins gain value ;-)

I'd second coinbase.com as a reputable (in the relative world of Bitcoin ;-)) place to buy/sell BTC.
Definitely also enable TFA (two factor authentication) on any online wallet you use - both coinbase.com and blockchain.info support it (don't' put serious money in anything that doesn't) - do it now. Right. Now.
[edit: coinbase.com recommends authy.com for maintaining TFA tokens - it's safe (uses client side encryption), can handle anything Google Authenticator can and whatever happens to your phone, you'll always be able to recover all your tokens, smart move to use it IMO]

I know the attraction of 'cool sounding yet meaningless English' in some foreign lang contexts but this one's a lose-lose proposition.

Hey cut 'em some slack ... who knows the exact motives, it doesn't' really matter - are they mainly helping or hurting the Bitcoin cause - I think mainly the former.
Some fairly interesting points ...
Q. In general, how have people responded to your pleas to take bitcoin?
- In general, people are referencing whatever scant information they have about bitcoin, and they listen with a healthy level of skepticism. But we've found that new business owners are generally more ready to make changes, rather than the business that's been around for decades and have no interest in changing. 
Q. What have you discovered about the bitcoin community during this adventure so far?
- It's a fantastic group to be a part of. They're extremely supportive, smart, and they keep us focused. Feedback on what we should or shouldn't be trying is helpful, and they almost always respond well to communication from us.

If you simply must do it ASAP, yeah get a coinbase.com account and initiate verification and hookup your bank account (ideally to save 2 days and the 'name the 2 deposits' approach give them your credentials then change the password right away afterwards).
If you can cool your heels just a little:
1) Do coinbase.com anyways, you will be buying/doing more in BTC and more than one way to do everything is even more important in XBT space than other places
2) Get a CampBX.com account and wait until Nov 21 when they will have ACH-in (bank hookup)
Oh last but ABSOLUTELY not least make sure you enable TFA (two factor authentication) on both of the above and ANY bitcoin account you ever use (that isn't just for trivial  amounts).  Google Authenticator is fine though I personally prefer authy.com

Significant $ ? I stick w/ Gavin's line about "not more than you can afford to loose" and more towards the 'painful to loose' but certainly not anywhere near 'very significant'.
Charity isn't a good characterization IMO, it's more like promotion for the common good (Christ that sounds socialist :-/) - micro-tips are cheap and can be a good way to spread the word and make new useful connections - self-benefiting digital seeding ;-)

Well, good they aren't' asleep at least and all thigns being equal one would expect if they are in conversation/under review then FinCEN is unlikely to close them down (though that's not 100% clear IANAL).
As for 'boiling it down to a checkbox' being overly simplistic - I think it's pretty simple, they either turn up on that MSB search (thanks to  in thread below for that) or they don't - seems pretty simple!

Share on twitter Share on facebook Share on more
639 up, 164 down
A substance commonly used for Anaesthesia of animals and small children. Popularized by John Lilly as a psychoactive substance somewhat related to Phencycledine (PCP) in effect. In Timothy Leary's 8-circuit-model of consciousness this drug is associated with the 8th and highest circuit. Effects of a solid dose (particularly injected) include intense OOBE's (out of body experiences), Lilliputian hallucinations (feeling "as big as the universe" or "as small as an electron", often simultaneously) and other such psychedelic effects.

I was wondering if this was gonna end in a fusterCluck after the events from earlier in the day w/ Jeff pulling out.  Anyways noone w/ 1/2 a brain skeds a dog and pony show like that w/out knowing 99.9% it'll basically work.
I wish them well, I wish FinCen et all go *&amp;%$^&amp; themselves (not gonna happen) but they seem to be going at it in a measured intelligent way and the PR isn't sucking by any means quite to the contrary.
It somewhat pains me to say it but B-ATM+Europe FTW ... take it to Cyprus and Spain.
Hope they get ready for Japan too though likely to be a restrictive as the US unless 六代目山口組 (Yamaguchi gumi == yakuza!) can be leveraged - enough of a cut there can move mountains ;-)

Seriously, hang in there, you're still one of the lucky relative few who have even heard of Bitcoin yet never mind actually taken some action on it - better yet consider your 'loss' a badge of courage, a Bitcoin Purple Heart of sorts (granted many others have lost a hell of a lot more, but it's all relative).

True enough, I also believe in spreading funds around - these 2 and Havelock and a few other places. For new and/or less techie folks I usually recommend coinbase.com partly for the +ve reason you stated but also because I think it has the simplest/cleanest UI (but not the most comprehensive of course, the usual trade-off with such things).

I can't decide who should get nailed more CC or PayPal - I mean both work but are all so dumb fat and happy generally.

Not to sound too simplistic but: the higher the risk the higher the potential reward.  Even if you consider it an outlier in your portfolio, I'd submit it's worth a flutter ;-)

I've never used Fort Gox - it took so long to get registered that I was already up and running on coinbase.com and then later, CampBX.com
That said, think it's in BTC's best interest for the larger exchanges including Gox to be as functional as possible (though more and more diversification from Gox is a Good Thing).
Thanks for this, Roger.

@_date: 2013-10-22 15:19:45
I wonder how much they cashed in at what price, it's varied a lot since inception. I have no problem with them making a profit, the whole thing was pretty much a crap shoot, I've enjoyed their journey (and helping out Austin charge a phone once), I'll like the T-shirt and looking forwarding to the movie and showing it to new folks assuming it's any good.

- Buy:  MtGox (but good luck with the time it takes to get verified), bitfloor.com (and make sure you use limit order in times like today!)
@_date: 2013-10-11 00:47:01
I dunno I kinda like CBX, they were good about jumping on FinCEN/MSA, their TFA is sound and I've never had a problem with them. That said, agree while functional their website could do with some slicking up.
@_date: 2013-12-12 02:35:10
Pretty sound, for extra fun and credit get a campbx.com account (with TFA *of course*) and buy BTC generally cheaper there than coinbase.com but move to either coinbase or blockchain.info right away.  BTC exhanges face extra longevity issues compared to 'online wallets'

That's a little harsh or your experience is different than mine - I've never seen slowness issues on the site (and I've done 3 pages of tips in the last 4 mons or so).
I think the landing page is fine - shows the canonical weusecoins.com intro vid (and the other good one with the annoying Ozzie accent).
Also recommends coinbase.com which is also fine IMO - though it would be better if they had tighter integration into account creation/deposit - that's what should come next (if people choose it but of course allow deposit to any address still).

Alright  wild assumption that you have a sensible chunk of your earthy store in something unexcitely reasonable like [VFINX]( I'd offer, with a remainder of Lost-Wages-play-fiat:
1) get yourself a  and shoot the breeze on AM100 perhaps.
2) just keep some BTC in blockchain.info
3) in the name of all that's holy - do some tipping (btctip.com for twitter is great), use some BTC in a local store/restaurant, i.e. get out there and help drive the value of 1 &amp; 2 !
Good luck and remember giving and receiving are just different folds in the same cloth.

Tough one.  How good a decision this is sort of depends on how much he really needed the car.  If not so much then this could be good if he can afford to hold BTC long enough (maybe the right decision for not entirely the right reasons but that also happens in life right ?!).
I completely second the advise to HOLD now that he's in, things could get very rocky fast depending on how next week goes in particular.  One way or another this is going to be an informative lesson if he's willing to learn.  Encourage him to be open to all this - 'good' or 'bad' it's all  grist for the mill.

Actually I sometimes confuse it with "Decisions force actions" - which also kinda makes sense.  Anyways more importantly CBX may not have wanted to get into ACH deposit but unless they can partner with someone that does for free (like Dwolla did) maybe they might have to seriously consider it to compete w/ people like coinbase.com (then again I have no idea of the costs/effort involved so you may be right - do nothing is an OK option for them).

I have a huge suggestion for next time ... i.e. as soon as you get the account back and want to add TFA again ... use authy.com not Goog Authenticator.  It's safe cos it does client-side encryption of the tokens and it will allow Xfer of 'TFA device' by means of an SMS confirm so solves the issue of a phone getting lost and/or ROMing (which I do a lot of).
