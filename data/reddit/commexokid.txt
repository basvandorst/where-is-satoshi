Move your coins to gdax right away. They are the same company but gdax doesn't charge outrageous fees.
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:32:13
You really got to read up. They already won a lawsuit against coinbase to disclose.

Btw, there's a whole profession based on "screwing the government" as your call it. Tax accountants.
