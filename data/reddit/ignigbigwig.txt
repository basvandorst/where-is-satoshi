Not necessarily...
What large institutional investors would bring to the table is stability. With a larger market cap, the daily fluctuations would be further minimized. One exchange going down or a hack of a major Bitcoin service provider will be much less detrimental to the Bitcoin ecosystem as the percentage of the market they control is decreased.

I didn't say you *have* to provide personal info, you're missing the point. If you're not willing to provide the info though, then don't make the claim of being a CFA. If you're actually a CFA, you can't seriously be naive enough to not understand how allowing anyone to claim they're CFA without proof is problematic.

As a Certified Internet Advisor, I agree.

Okay, bro. Whatever you say, bro.

Like I said, the actual advice is fine, but there's zero reason to accept it as having come from a CFA, that's the point you're obviously too fucking obtuse to comprehend. No way an actual CFA is this dumb, but whatever, clearly this is going nowhere and I've said enough that anyone reading the comments will at the very least question your credentials as well, so carry on...

Never said it was pissing me off, your hostility and lack of understanding of the issue here is really making me doubt your claimed credentials though. I am not asking you to prove anything, but for all intents and purposes, your posts should not be taken by anyone reading them as coming from a CFA. The CFA charter is probably one of the hardest credentials to obtain, and of the legitimate CFA charter holders I've had the pleasure of meeting, none would have such difficulty understanding the issue being raised here.

Then don't use "As a CFA..." to qualify your statements. 
Pretty ironic to give this kind of advice "as a CFA" expecting people to blindly accept your statements as coming from a CFA.
Your advice is pretty common sense stuff, and providing such advice is fine, but dont make claims you can't or aren't willing to backup.
