In the U.S. - 
I am not sure that compulsory voting would, in fact, compel politicians to change their tune - save for, perhaps, causing them to become more neutral so as to capture more voter interest.
Taxes are a thing, but there are ways around them (even legal ones).
Vietnam was the last time anyone was forced to fight in a war without being a voluntary member of the military.
It's 13, not 16, not that it matters (that's just FYI).
And if voting is compulsory it would be taking place every other year, not every 4, as people would have to vote in local, state, and national elections as the President isn't the only leader.
Also, shit as my life may be right now, I fulfill my obligations.

They're happy to be forced to fight and die, if drafted; they're happy to not bother being informed, or even just voting ignorantly.
They being those that don't bother taking part.
I'm not them.

...compulsory voting?
Fu... in the U.S. males get compulsory draft registration with the "right to vote" and that's where responsibility ends.
