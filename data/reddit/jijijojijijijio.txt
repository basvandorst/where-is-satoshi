Don't listen to them. People here can be mean. Some love to pass their frustration on those who complain about losing money. That being said, next time you invest into anything make sure it's money you won't need right away. That way you will be able to hold until the dip passes so you can sell at a profit instead of a loss. ( If you choose to trade)

I had to stop using their exchange it was too annoying to try and sell or buy while having their system freeze 5x in a row. It's an ok plateform but you can definitely find better.

It doesn't work very well on mobile for me

I got accepted on quadriga after 2 months and a half. She can buy them in stores/ATM or through you and friends.

Thank you very much for the answer. I can't wait to read this tonight. :)

There's no article

Yes even if the trade seems successful you got to take the fees into account. My beginner's mistake was to realize that they took cash fees (when I bought) but btc fees when I sold. That means that you gotta double checking what's the amount of BTC you have post sale,  if you are holding some of your BTC while trading the rest. If not you might sell at a low price btc you bought for higher...

I was quoting the article. (Sarcasm)

His video was actually very clear and I thought his logic made sense. Obviously he's not a psychic but the argument he uses are logical. Thanks for sharing.

I think that he wants to know when whales are putting big amounts of BTC on the exchange in order to sell before they do. Therefore avoiding the big dump. It would be great for the small players to have easy access to that type of information.

Loool "All FUDs are disappearing and people are seeing good news everywhere. Chinese new year has been finished. All asian countries started to buy. We will see more good news in upcoming days."

Your app looks very nice. I like the idea of changing the colors.  Honnestly the most important thing is that the prices are accurate and that they refresh automatically. What I find is missing on most crypto app are charts that let you compare how your coin was doing in past years with comparative charts. Ex: Btc in 2015 vs 2017
Also, some apps give you the possibility to click on w e currency and get to an explanation on what it's meant for. Etc.
Keep up the good work.

Why are you attacking him? He got burned aleady... He just tried to sell some btc not outsmart anyone. I'd even say he's acting very humble in his message.
@_date: 2018-02-24 22:15:45
I know many people who had hundreds of those and sold them too fast losing money or barely turning a profit.

Most big cities have stores or atm machines where you can buy / sell btc. Google it. I would tell you to transfer it to an exchange (ex: coinbase) but you are probably not verified. Coin stores and atm machines take a fee and it can go up to 12% of the transaction. Be sure to search for the cheapest options. If not there's always localBitcoin and other sites to sell/buy btc from person to person.

I personally hate it. It keeps freezing and bugging on me. It doesn't matter if you use your phone or computer. If there is even a mild volume of people using it you will have to refresh/ close the page 20x to be able to enter your bid and press the button. By that time the prices obviously changed...

I switched all my alts to btc last month and I don't regret it. They almost all dip lower and don't go as high.

Wait for Sunday's crash
@_date: 2018-03-26 06:15:14
You've dodged a bullet.
@_date: 2018-04-03 04:17:19
It's not dead. At least you didn't buy at 25k. Even if this year might be hard remember that in summer 2019 is the halving which should make the price of BTC soar.

They are mostly scamming the bank or credit card company not really the user personally. The user get refunded everything. Though I can't wait for more stores to accept BTC so credit card companies can stop making so much money out of their clients ~20%/ year) and stores that accept them (2%- 5% from every transaction).
