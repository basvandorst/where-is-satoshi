Earn ~$13. Pay income tax. Buy bitcoin paying ~1% fee. End up with $10 worth, considering the bid-ask spread.
@_date: 2016-03-01 21:38:19
Ah, yes. Censorship to the rescue!
@_date: 2016-03-01 21:36:02


Don't think so. Transactions sent with proper fees are attractive enough, even if they are sent just to prove a point, to post a text message into the blockchain, or to artificially fill up blocks. They are still spam, attractiveness for inclusion into blockchain notwithstanding.
@_date: 2016-03-01 07:20:37
It's like saying I'm paying you, so do the work you've been assigned and don't complain. I'm paying you 1 cent per hour. It's more than zero so "I'm paying you" is a factual statement.

"Even though many people will blame Bitcoin for these ransomware attacks, the digital currency has nothing to do with the hackers’ intent to wreak havoc on computer systems.."

Are they approaching the speed of light? Time is still passing at the same rate. The interval between blocks being found has increased.
@_date: 2016-03-03 00:31:22
This could potentially be the cause of latest backlog. People did not adjust their behavior and the client is setting fees too low. 
@_date: 2016-03-03 00:35:24
I quadruple warn people about generating and keeping their keys and backups safe. I don't have their keys. If btc disappears they can't suspect me. Goes a longer way to maintaining trust vs having even slightest degree of doubt over $5 or $10 bucks.

I'm connecting the religious part to his filtering of gambling services. But yes, that isn't the main point here.

I doubt they are making a killing on donations but I have donated, couple of times.
@_date: 2016-03-01 21:54:51
This gets asked a lot. Search for it.
@_date: 2016-03-01 22:51:53
It's hard to decide what's an attack and what isn't. If crazed religious coder says a tx should be filtered out is it not same as a bank or government agency saying it? We jeer at the latter.

The map sometimes places the location in the middle of ocean. It's completely meaningless.

Disagreeing with you; has nothing to do with government even. Defending home and family from robbers and assailants is invaluable.
@_date: 2016-06-14 22:11:17


Dude, you gotta be kidding me.
@_date: 2016-11-03 04:58:33
Take $1000 and set it on fire. Feel the heat? Turn on a noisy fan. There, you're mining and earning exactly the same amount of BTC as if you would if you purchased mining equipment.
@_date: 2016-11-03 04:41:10
I'm sure you're a wonderful person, but what's with stealing my name idea? Also the comment is undeserved. One_liner there is just being cautious.
@_date: 2016-11-06 03:39:00
Depends on the type of work you do. If it's not all that relevant it will look like a hobby on a resume. Oh, he's is into basket weaving and something about chaining blocks together. Or you could buy 3.66BTC.

Anus of ex-CEO of Reddit. It didn't say it was affiliated with CB. Clearly stated that it was a mod on another sub. Apparently it helps coinbase customers, and functions as a valve in a body, probably once a day or so.
@_date: 2016-11-06 06:09:43
Their name checks out.
@_date: 2016-11-06 06:21:59
You see addresses. They are hashes of public keys, not public keys. You see new one for every transaction, which is good. You can create separate accounts to keep split balances. Generally keeping track of addresses is not necessary; the app will keep balances for you.
@_date: 2016-11-06 04:57:15
You're comparing apples to bicycles.
@_date: 2016-11-03 06:08:30

Neither coinbase nor circle are an exchange. Coinbase owns an exchange called gdax.com

Buy stock in electricity company. This customer is going to see a really fat usage bill.
@_date: 2016-02-13 23:15:36
So they can control it. Roll it back, fork it at will, etc. Also adding features and changing how it works is easier. Behold the shitshow that is upping the block size limit.

"X company accepts bitcoin" isn't really news deserving of its own thread anymore. Only maybe if that company is huge or seen as anti-bitcoin, i.e. "Chase Bank accepts BTC for mortgage payments!"
@_date: 2016-02-26 01:20:38


Bitcoins are not in the wallets. They are in the blockchain.
@_date: 2016-02-25 03:39:11
One day bitcoin will be worth $xxxxxxx (hey one can dream) and the price will change by like max 2 or 3 cents per day. Would not be fun to stare at that.

Is the table round?
Better not be sitting around some rectangular bullshit.

With hashing power splitting in 2 directions the economics of continuing to mine on "losing" chain will ensure only one chain will dominate. Probably very quickly.
@_date: 2016-02-29 21:18:54
Around 4PM eastern with 40MB backlog I sent a small transaction with 0.00015 fee. It was included in the next block about 10 min after.
@_date: 2016-02-26 01:16:34
TLDR: Charging 1% to trade BTC infrequently and offering free on-chain and off-chain transactions generates less revenue than charging 0.25% to trade BTC frequently.
@_date: 2016-02-06 19:58:46
How does one get banned from reddit entirely? Sounds like an empty threat. That sub is vicious. You say that perhaps "other client" is not necessarily the right way to go about block size limit increase and get dv to hell.
@_date: 2016-10-04 03:51:27
You really should ask them. This is not &lt;insert company name&gt; support sub.
@_date: 2016-10-03 20:41:48


This valid point is often completely missed.
@_date: 2016-10-04 02:36:39
It means someone is paying for storing their money (instead of earning interest on it). Theoretically, instead of settling for a guaranteed loss, some of that money may be moved into bitcoin hoping for potential gain. Peeps thinking their 0.3BTC will make them millionaires rejoice.
