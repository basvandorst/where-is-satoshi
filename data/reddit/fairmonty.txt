There are lots of other digital currency communities you can join. Bitcoin is precious and people must compete for block-space. It is inevitable.

Uphold keeps the money. They appear to be scammers using KYC as a scapegoat. They can arbitrarily keep the money for any reason now.

Well, now I’ve seen it all from this guy.

Pretty sure California voted to move forward with the California/New California process... it’s a long process but it’s moving forward. The coastal soyboy’s are killing the state currently

What software are you(they) using?
And what client software can customers use to pay? Any mobile?
Would love to do this for my projects!

I've seen some that did just the first few. The malware had a huge list of pregenerated addresses to draw from. Someone could make an even bigger list with the last few lining up too, theoretically.

You know everyone here is just trying to make Bitcoin work right? This isn't a he-said she-said shaming show. What word does Erik owe you?
Honestly if anything, being in this space 24/7 for years breaks you down. Plus, thoughts mature.

You know. It never hit me that this was actually a humanitarian disaster. So many people hurting. Starving. Because of the money printing press and bad men. 
I used to laugh at these notes but it was real for so many people. "What is Bitcoin? Bitcoin represents right v wrong."
