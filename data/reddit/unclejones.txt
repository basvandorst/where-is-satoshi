I recently bought a reasonable amount from these guys:
Lots of options with bank, and the coins were in my wallet within an hour of the deposit.

Some discussion on tax implications here:
Hopefully the ATO provides a more specific guide before tax time.

If i rolled the dice 50 times, and then stick my email address at the end of it would that be enough?

I'm in.

Was nearly going to go with them this morning (decided against it because of all the waiting around people were complaining about on Whirlpool), ended up going through Bit Trade and they were super fast.

Sorry to hijack, but while us Aussies are all assembled here, where is the best place to sell. For example, where can I sell more than 5k a day? Does it have to be on an international exchange?

Pretty much my experience today, only my envelope only had 5k in it.

Guilty. Need an iphone app that will just alert me when the price dips/rises above a certain point

I'm sorry you're here and brought that tone to the thread. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 09:36:58
Any options for Aussies?

Wish I had the balls to put that much in. What was it like carrying 50k to the bank?

Hi Nickolay,
I eventually got this sorted out - Liquipay refunded the money.

Cheers. Looks like I selected the BTC link after all because it's confirmed. How long does it take to show up in BTC-E usually?
(I need to go to damn bed, clearly not seeing properly).

Cheers. I'll try that next time.
