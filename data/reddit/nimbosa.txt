They had 75% of all new, freshly mined $bCC / $bCH at the time. Or for the next 12 hours or so.

"the individual has always had to struggle
to keep from being overwhelmed by the tribe
if you try it, you will be lonely often, and sometimes frightened
but no price is too high to pay for the privilege of owning yourself"
- Friedrich Nietzsche -

Unwritten law is called "custom" or common law. Can you cite any human society that has lawyers and litigation but no written laws?  When you file a case in any court, it is written, not verbal, and the law you cite in your case will also have to be written.  Even a traditional country now surviving, like the United Kingdom has gone through codifying its own laws that were once unwritten.
Writing LAWS, contracts and accounting on paper was a great development in human civilization.  It was a huge agreement over verbal agreement or mere social custom. So is codifying rules and consensus on blockchain, in my opinion, as time will tell..  Do you see the parallel here? New technologies create new realities, new spheres and new medium for social contact to evolve into new forms.

there is NO LAW (per se) governing bitcoin, only community consensus rules! this is what we call a FULLY DECENTRALIZED network that no one could censor..

i can see you are for the state regulation of Bitcoin, eh? :D
@_date: 2017-10-20 07:13:34
how were the Laws written before writing? who implemented Laws before the rise of nation-states or even city-states? from where are you getting your data?

I am of the opinion that regulating bitcoin is not only a terrible idea, but also superfluous. It is in the same league of state regulation over the use of paper and silk, or fiat for that matter.  This is technological innovation. Cryptocurrencies are evolving use cases that are, by design, improvements over state sponsored fiat.  States regulating bitcoin et alia is self-serving in that their aim is to prevent the erosion of their respective fiat, and other state monopolies. History, i believe, will prove bitcoin regulation futile.  Monopolies don't last long.

woah.. for a while there, i thought you were referring to Ancient Aliens studying prehistoric humans? LOL
i do not believe in "higher" or "lower" civilizations, they are mere cultural biases of the students
the invention of blockchain as a form of digital record has parallels in the invention of writing as analog, both change the game entirely

That is the day Bitcoin dies - when it succumbs to what governments legislate/regulate, or what corporations decide for that matter. Bitcoin is what the community consensus says it is. I would not be surprised if Big Governments and Big Corporations turn out to be behind these subtle and not-so-subtle attacks against Bitcoin. It is in the Establishment's interest to destroy what they cannot control. Classic Divide and/or Destroy Strategy. :D
But i believe Bitcoin shall survive.
Technological consensus and software-based contracts are new phenomena. You are free to persevere in your faith in the Ancien Regime, but the OLD LAWS are crumbling.  The CryptoCurrency Revolution is akin to the invention of writing, the invention of money and accountancy, the spring of nations, and the Neolithic Revolution. We are barely scratching the surface now. This is but the opening salvo. Who knows what we can evolve into?

that's why it is called unwritten law, our point of reference is today where most laws you cite ARE written, because we cannot turn back time, nor can we turn back the innovations that has happened since then, now can we? ;)

somebody else is using the same name now.. Which came first?
