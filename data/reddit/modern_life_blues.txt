Why would anyone need margin trading?
@_date: 2016-08-20 23:40:11
Agreed. Using bitcoin at this point only make sense with a merchant you have a personal relationship with, more for educational purposes than anything else. Otherwise it's just hodl.
@_date: 2016-08-28 00:36:30
Never thought of it that way, though it sounds so obvious. Lol
@_date: 2016-08-24 06:01:14
And accepting payments through the watch-only copy is unsafe because I'm not doing the validation myself?
@_date: 2016-08-08 16:19:22
Good detective work
@_date: 2016-08-19 06:33:49
Besides making a huge ideological statement (state governments = unnecessary apparatuses), it's a great investment ;) Bitcoin is the best money money can buy
@_date: 2016-08-06 18:14:20
How does it even enter your mind that core's effort should revolve around the particular requirements/plans of a single hodler? Does Bitcoin not rely on community consensus?
@_date: 2016-08-23 07:19:27
Why for naught? If I'm running a light client then someone else is actually doing the validating for me.

I always thought it was a rhino....&lt;leans over and examines&gt;
@_date: 2016-08-29 21:36:53
- My phone's already out (in my hand)
- unlocking is a swipe
- Bitcoin "app" open is a swipe and a click
- pin is exactly 6 keystrokes
- 0conf is practically immediate in my experience (not longer than waiting for CC confirmation)
All of the above steps would be required for Apple/Google Pay. Did you even think before you commented?
@_date: 2016-08-07 12:58:48


You meant of not holding your own keys. Please don't conflate the currency/software with nondescript 3rd party exchanges. So long as you control your own keys your exposure to such risks is nonexistent.
@_date: 2016-08-11 19:34:11
Well good software developers are an elite, and if you want your devs more "likable" then I suggest you invest in one of the many other coins out there. Core's job is to maintain and make improvements to the Bitcoin protocol. If they come off as aloof or brash so be it. What matters is the code. Please internalize this.
The shift to Bitcoin doesn't necessarily have to come about in a natural disaster warzone type of scenario you're referring to. The shift can occur over an extended period of time where momentum is built until those still using fiat will be economically compelled to make the shift.
@_date: 2016-08-03 18:49:05
Bitcoin would probably be much more valuable! Exchanges don't necessarily provide the significant value to the "ecosystem" you claim they do...Anyone *selling* Bitcoin in fact is hurting its value. Liquidity in the sense you refer to i.e. the ability to cash out quickly is overrated re Bitcoin long term growth - what is drastically more important is the act of hoarding, which absolutely doesn't require "real time trading". Sorry.
@_date: 2016-08-27 19:07:11
Why not? Do normal people not take care of the cash that's in their possession? Why do you make keeping safe/remembering a mnemonic phrase such an unreasonable task? Sometimes I wonder if threads like this are actually posted by real people....=/

Why wouldn't you be able to run your own Electrum server if you're already running a full node?
@_date: 2016-08-27 21:35:59
Ironically I personally have had more trouble restoring my account through those "secret questions" than through mnemonic seeds. I guarantee you almost any millennial would have NO problem using the most basic features of a wallet like mycelium.
@_date: 2016-08-23 17:48:52
Are you saying that light clients only validate transactions through mining full nodes? If so, why would this be necessary?
@_date: 2016-08-24 17:54:12
Bitcoin is anarchist in essence. Even if it doesn't replace banks and/or states it will undermine the political apparatuses as we know them. It might take 5 years or 50 years. The point is that decoupling monetary policy from state rule is pretty much emasculating the state. This is historic fact. The best currencies were always issued by the strongest kingdoms. If Bitcoin takes off as money for the masses then states will have in effect lost much of their legitimacy to rule. This is practically self evident. Calling someone who makes that (correct) observation a kook is very puzzling.
@_date: 2016-08-23 10:41:26
Ok.....but at the end of the day their transactions are being validated and inserted into the blockchain thanks to some full node who may or may not be validating its own transactions. There *is* benefit. How do you say that they don't benefit?
@_date: 2016-08-24 06:57:19
@_date: 2016-08-11 17:44:56
The "new people" won't be attracted to Bitcoin because it's such an awesome payment system; they'll come flocking to it because it will be the best money. Which it is, thanks to Core efforts.
@_date: 2016-08-03 18:50:41
I agree with your sentiments but why are you always so angry and vulgar?
@_date: 2016-08-03 20:26:57
This whole "liquidity" meme is just a half assed justification of various attempts at making a quick buck off of Bitcoin.  Its idealization is completely inappropriate and is even harmful to the market. To boot, if I can buy what I want with Bitcoin then it's liquid on its own, no?
@_date: 2016-08-23 10:15:47
I was talking about selflessly running a full node - so that others (e.g. light clients) can validate their transactions. What's wrong with that?
@_date: 2016-08-23 18:27:11
How then do deterministic wallets process valid transactions?
@_date: 2016-08-25 17:44:56
I always thought it was possible to tell if data is encrypted or not...if I encrypt a file on my hard drive then anyone trying to open it will realize it's encrypted, no?

How are they watch-only if I can send money from my wallet to another HD wallet? Valid transaction on the blockchain

He's better off hodling anyhow
@_date: 2016-08-23 18:51:12
Ok, I always thought that the main feature of deterministic wallets was portability - they eliminate the need to run your own full node, no?
@_date: 2016-08-29 20:36:56
Looked like he was reading off a teleprompter.
@_date: 2016-08-11 17:43:25
Bitcoin isn't out to "win hearts and minds". It's a protocol that defines distributed consensus. When the "hearts and minds" out there will realize they need it for the sake of their liberty they will turn to it, more out of animal survival instincts.
@_date: 2016-08-06 20:48:25
A lot of speculating... Bitcoin is complex - it functions as both a currency and payment system. You need to be patient, improvements don't come overnight.
@_date: 2016-08-03 19:30:12
Hoarding isn't static - hoarders create demand. Now, if everyone is looking to buy who's selling? Well, everyone has a price they're willing to sell at: that's in essence the market rate. That's the basic concept. That's why these exchanges keep prices down: they allow people with no long term interest in Bitcoin to participate in the Bitcoin economy. Fact is 120 thousand bitcoin were on bitfinex. Why? What sane person would leave their coin in the hands of a third party? Only someone who has no interest in hodling his coin.
@_date: 2016-08-23 07:04:31
Can you elaborate? I was under the impression that a full node helps with transaction validation: making sure inputs and outputs add up before being added by miners to blocks. So wouldn't a full node be serving the network irrespective of my personal usage?
@_date: 2016-08-27 19:13:11

So do I. I just prefer to be able to decide for myself what these "protections" consist of and what is a fair price to pay for them (as opposed to a crony bureaucrat). It's what's called voluntary association, something lacking (and practically impossible) in today's fiat fueled political governance model. I'm hoping in a bitcoin based economy public affairs will be more in sync with Lockean ideals.
@_date: 2016-04-22 08:51:37
So long you promote kyc/aml software you will get bashed by people in the Bitcoin space, and justifiably so. The state has run its course and any tools giving politicians more power over people's personal finances are repulsive by nature. It's a shame you don't understand that.
@_date: 2016-08-30 20:01:12
I think you should because you have personal relationships with those merchants. They know you. They treat you well when you come back. If I'm using Bitcoin as money then I want to use it at those places as much as on the Internet. I need physical items like fruits and gas.

Excuse me? Are you familiar with the kosher food business? Products are certified as kosher by absolutely private bodies, entrusted by people through *reputation alone* for that purpose. And the criteria are stringent and the costs are great but voluntary association I.e. market forces is the instantiating factor. I don't see how this model can't be implemented in other aspects e.g. food safety, industry standards etc. And this has been going on for thousands of years so it has been proven to work.

@_date: 2016-04-08 12:31:36


Who cares? They may as well demand that I start using tulips as currency. Copyright is unenforceable as intellectual property isn't something tangible which title can be ascribed to. Big business are criminally using their crony relationship with legislators to waste public funds for securing by coercion title to property that exists only in people's minds.
@_date: 2016-04-21 20:26:29
That's the thing: if a kosher authority gave its label to a food product which turned out not to be kosher - it's dead. When a Rabbi stamps a product he is saying: "this is absolutely kosher according to the standards you as a consumer know myself to adhere to" and woe to the certifying authority who will even be caught once cheating. There is intense competition and consumers have a variety to choose from based on their criteria and level of trust.

I question the influence of the consumers whose perception you refer to. Those are the late comers, the followers. By the time they will understand that bitcoin is the new money its value will have gone up greatly due to other more fundamental factors such as the deterioration of fiat through central banking.
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:39:29

Overlap in audience isn't a consideration here. The connection is consequential - TOR and Bitcoin are *tools of subversion* at their heart and don't enjoy mutual audiences due to circumstance. I concede that this is a borderline case, but it might be exempt from the "usually" stipulation in the "not containing the word Bitcoin" rule. (As opposed to say general python or node.js news.)

This type of news doesn't worry me at all. If Bitcoin relies on old world big corporations for legitimacy as a medium of exchange then it has failed.

I agree. DNMs were a big part of Bitcoin's early history, except that that wasn't the primary motivation behind Bitcoin's creation; Satoshi didn't release the software to help facilitate the fentanyl trade. This is clear from the Genesis block. So if Bitcoin in 2017 isn't the ideal solution for DNMs then there are other coins on the market. It's not like you don't have a choice and this is why I resent the BS claim of "Bitcoin isn't usable". I send and receive Bitcoin all the time. It doesn't suit your usage? There are other coins.

Yes government at its root is evil, albeit with humanity in its current state, a necessary evil. Are you familiar with Lockean natural rights? Do you not believe in markets? Free will is a basic feature of human existence and government, to varying extents, forcibly prohibits humans from implementing this feature. This is fact. Is this a good thing? I don't think so, especially when government has proven time and again that it does so not for the good of the commons but rather for its own benefit. See the DC lobbying industry. Yes, infrastructure that serves the commons must be maintained and there is definitely room for discussion whether individuals should be coerced and to what extent in participating in these endeavors, but government in its current form goes far beyond this and sees itself as a patriarch and the sole custodian of public welfare. Again, is this a good thing?

I agree. DNMs were a big part of Bitcoin's early history, except that that wasn't the primary motivation behind Bitcoin's creation; Satoshi didn't release the software to help facilitate the fentanyl trade. This is clear from the Genesis block. So if Bitcoin in 2017 isn't the ideal solution for DNMs then there are other coins on the market. It's not like you don't have a choice and this is why I resent the BS claim of "Bitcoin isn't usable". I send and receive Bitcoin all the time. It doesn't suit your usage? There are other coins.

Great article. I enjoyed the anecdotes.
Just two nitpicks:
Cashing out shouldn't be the final objective of the hodler/investor. Exchanging for goods and services should be the ultimate way a hodler realizes a return on his investment. Cashing out should only be done under compelling circumstances (paying rent, food etc.). Hodlers, being investors, should sell their coins i.e. exchange them for goods and services, only when it will be the most profitable for them, which would be when Bitcoin's value comparative to fiat becomes so high that providers of goods and services have no choice but to accept Bitcoin (the "positive feedback loop"). This would also liberate commerce, coincide with the reformation of banking and finance, change the relationship between public office holders and citizens etc. (the Paradigm shift^tm).
iPhone comparison: 
The difference between an iPhone and Android is in comparable to the difference between Bitcoin and alts. iPhone is in no essential way superior to Android (it's actually inferior in that it runs on closed proprietary software), so that the probability of an Android competitor overtaking it as the most lucrative product in the market isn't low and can even be expected (due to changes in people's priorities and preferences). Bitcoin is superior to alts almost by definition: the currency with the highest market share *is* the "best" currency, and such is the case with Bitcoin. For any alt to overtake bitcoin it would be required to be superior to Bitcoin as bitcoin is to fiat. (If a hodler sells Bitcoin for an alt he is going against the market).

What you can do instead:
* Write down your mycelium seed on a piece of paper and keep it somewhere secure.
* Export your master public key from mycelium go to *export* and a long string starting with 'xpub' will be displayed. Copy-paste that somewhere for later access.
* Delete mycelium from your device.
* Reinstall a wallet that allows you to be in watching-only mode. I think mycelium allows you to be though you can install something like

It's what Bitcoin is capable of. Bitcoin is capable of being used as a currency *right now*. Yes, things have changed. I remember when Bitcoin was worth just a couple of hundred bucks. Today we're over 15k. And it's not because it's an easy currency to buy drugs with. Just embrace reality and stop playing "what if". A scaling solution (and a very elegant one at that) is on its way and you'll be able to easily buy heroin once more for cheap (and with even better privacy). Every actor in this ecosystem has their own interests but for the sake of the **collective*" (which is what Bitcoin is) every individual sometimes needs to make sacrifices. It's not like DNMs can't function today: you can easily use monero or litecoin in the meantime, which are coins that this bull market has allowed also to grow in usage and acceptance.

    // NOTE: master priv key shouldn't be used for signing because repeated signing using the

I can make a fork of a Linux distro, say Ubuntu, and then call it Ubuntu Unlimited and I wouldn't be violating any terms of the distribution license, correct? This is done all the time as far as I know (xubuntu, lubuntu, kubuntu etc.) and no one cares, well because no damage is caused to the original branch. In fact if it's a soft fork (e.g. above distros) the original branch probably benefits as the brand name probably will get more recognition. 
Crypto-currencies are different because currency by definition needs to be something that can't be easily counterfeited. So if a forker takes the name of the original branch (with which he by definition has no compatibility with) and labels his software with the same name then he's a huckster, a swindler. His actions shouldn't really be tolerated...

Why not? Most businesses today maintain their own websites and Bitcoin is relatively easy to use, and with another layer built on top of it will be even easier. The main hurdle for widespread adoption is psychological more than technical. People are afraid of being completely in control of their own money. The banks offer some kind of sense of security (whether imaginary or not is moot - this is what people believe)  and disengaging from the current system actually makes people uneasy. The people I speak to have more faith in the dollar than they do in Bitcoin because it's insured by the FDOC. Unbelievable right? Well, not to them because they've been conditioned to think that way and shifting to Bitcoin would be a paradigm shift - something that occurs usually over the course of generations. Therefore the "but merchants are used to third party legacy systems" argument is invalid from a technical point of view and is only an educational issue which thankfully is much easier to address.

I've never derided anyone for using bitcoin to buy stuff. I just think that as an investment strategy it's better to hodl than to make purchases that are going to be converted right away to fiat, as they don't add as much to the economy as simply buying and hoarding.


Really? Is that why I've been hodling for 3 and a half years? I've never believed in "getting rich quick", and I've never lived beyond my means. I've always made sure to have fiat available for my living expenses

The learning curve for Bitcoin is too steep for most lay investors, the types who will cash out once they've secured their returns -- most hodlers are just waiting for their coin to become valuable enough to use in the consumer market at a profit.
In any event, why is consumption the main determinant in GDP growth more than production? (Which indeed relies on the accumulation of capital i.e. hodling.)
@_date: 2015-12-30 17:07:43
You don't think with another layer that there will be even *more* third parties like Coinbase et al.? Third parties are exactly what makes handling Bitcoin easier, though would be worthwhile to to check the percentage of merchants who actually use them versus those who don't. Not sure the latter is the minority. 
Again, there will just be more opportunities for third parties to take advantage of a developing market. The more third parties the better - it's all part of decentralization. Using Electrum is also using a third party, no?
I don't even mention fiat in the same sentence as Bitcoin, this is borderline blasphemy. I'm not looking to cater to anyone interested in fiat conversion. There are plenty of pretty blockchains owned by Citi, Barclays HSBC whatever. Let em use those.

Software needs maintaining and the core devs are the ones stepping up and doing that. That's what makes them "in charge". And I for one am cool with that. There are many other cryptos in the world and if the core team will piss me off I will migrate to one of them. It's what's called voluntary association.

I tend to believe snowden was/is an actor following a script. Everyone and their grandmothers knew that spy agencies could eavesdrop on/hack you since the mid nineties. I remember sitting somewhere and being told to *take my battery out of my phone* as that could allow a potential eavesdropper to hear what was being said. Since I've been online I've always assumed "big brother" could track me at his will. Not that I cared because I'm a nobody and if I have to I'll use encryption. ) SNOWDEN REVEALED NOTHING NEW. Pretty amazing that the whole world was "shocked" by his revelations. At least that's what the garbage MSM would have had you think. Having said all of this, governments are just too freaking big today to actually function normally, not to say efficiently. Zero accountability means zero competence I.e. nepotism. It's always gonna be an insider of some sort who wins an election. Once the truly popular "man of the people" gets elected we have then slid into mob rule. There is no middle ground with universal suffrage. The system either gets manipulated or self combusts. Most humans just aren't that smart, let's face it.

Credit cards suck because of exorbitant fees merchants are charged which may or may not be passed on to the buyer (which would then suck for him, not to mention kyc/aml).

Good post Adam. The fundamental question is why are most miners still not supporting segwit? If it's because they don't understand the benefits of segwit then it's incumbent upon those who have open communication channels with them to educate and convince them. If it's because of political/personal reasons then they should either fork or be forked away because that's just disrespectful of the ecosystem at large (something which I hope does *not* happen). In general I think most hodlers and technologically aware people in the space agree that segwit is the way to go which makes miner coyness (if not belligerence) towards it questionable.

What started it all was Adam and eve eating the forbidden fruit. Human greed and avarice go back to the dawn of history. Wherever whenever rulers could put their fellow men under bondage it was done, whether in Babylon Rome or the US. The modern era starting with the invention of the printing press gave man a greater understanding of the world and tools to conquer it resulting in ultimately a better world but also in many horrors and abuses e.g. the banker Pentagon controlled US Corp. As the technologies advance so does human ability to do good or bad. Today the federal government has more resources at its command than ever before - but so does the citizenry. I'm teleological in that I believe that world is marching towards better future and liberty will prosper but the challenges we face today in the form of say KYC/compliance are much greater than what the whiskey rebels or the south faced yet at the same time much more easily overcome.

Public work done for "the people" (which really refers to any collective united around mutual interests, whatever they be) sometimes consists of handling sensitive data e.g. security matters, financial information so it would make perfect sense for the public officers to use encryption tools. Just like private entities use encryption tools. Anyhow how would you prevent a certain public officer from using encryption? That's laughable. It's like how certain politicians want to make Tor illegal. You only need leaks today because of the current crooked system which allows corrupt individuals to hold public office sans accountability.

Who was talking about the core devs?!? Reading comprehension please: Bitcoin's price, fundamentally speaking, isn't a function of it's usage as a medium of exchange. The hoarders give it is value. Why? Because hoarders have *future* expectations of Bitcoin's utility. Past experience e.g. darknet purchases, indeed are positive but only because investors are buying and *hodling* is Bitcoin valuable. Were all hodlers to spend their coins right now i.e. to unload their coins Bitcoin's price would tank. A mass hodl would have the opposite effect.

Yah, running a full node is *so* easy...relative to mining it's indeed peanuts but you'd still need a spare computer with unhindered Internet access plus ability (albeit basic) to configure your router. Again, nothing too complicated for the veteran home user but still difficult enough for Joe six pack. Running a full node should *never* become more complicated than it is now otherwise Bitcoin loses its basically most attractive feature: the *ability* to validate **any** transaction on the network with very basic hardware and networking resources.

My point was that there are two destructive forces battling it out in the world today and they're dragging along many innocents with them. Hopefully a financial solution like Bitcoin will allow for a more just power balance and there will be peace. Malicious freeloading is a despicable habit and should be denounced regardless of circumstance. The mideasterners who come to Germany and Sweden don't do so because their lives are in danger - they could've easily found refuge in Turkey or southeastern Europe; they came with intentions of getting free stuff (damned the consequences) at best, and of implementing Islamist ideology at worst. Except for cases of self defense, which the crimes perpetrated by "refugees" do *not* fall under, I am against violence (including western military).

I said I could be mistaken but in any event John Adams most definitely was among others. 
With regard to the whiskey rebellion there was debate about the legitimacy of its suppression, but regardless it was an isolated incident. Taxation and the regulatory regime in America were a lot more lax in pre-second industrial revolution America (1890s onward) than in the past hundred years. (Income tax for example)
My point was that manipulation of the money supply and the economy became much easier for the state once the right institutions were in place and backed by a strong (and heavily armed) federal government. As opposed to premodern times when taxation was ad hoc and regulation was very localized.

Look, the complaints about unconfirmed transactions due to faulty fee calculation IMO is coming from some troll brigade. There is no rational reason for someone to use a wallet that doesn't do the automatic calculation or to manually configure fees to save a few pennies. Anyone doing the above practically *deserves* not having his tx confirmed (if not worse). No sympathy for such idiocy and making it worse is the public protestation of "bitcoin is broken, my tx hasn't been confirmed for 6 hours": no you're broken (or probably a troll) and stfu and gtfo, no one cares about your coins (if you even have any), and use paypal if you want instant confirmations.(ironically you'd probably be paying a much higher fee.)

Who says jobs are good for the economy? I can guarantee every single able bodied man on this planet a full time job at at least minimum wage by eliminating aircraft, trucks and power tools from the global economy. But what happens then? Production plunges. The economy slumps. But everybody has a job! 
Hoarding, saving, is what ultimately gives a currency its value. A currency is valuable because of people's expectations of it, which is expressed in the hodl. The higher general expectations of a currency the greater its value. It's price goes up. *Even if not one person spends its tiniest unit*. You Keynesian clowns fail to understand that human networks are the most vital component of any functioning economy. Thankfully Bitcoin will illustrate this lesson very clearly for you.

Thanks for making that clear bc it seems to have gone over a few heads: this is a political conflict. Core is "in control" of a digital nation state worth more than six billion dollars and classic is the upstart who wants to "be in control". No different from any other political struggle in human history. With the one oh so subtle difference that Bitcoin is an anarchy. All parties are acting through the medium of voluntary association. And more importantly there is consensus, currently. Why the classic crowd wants to remake consensus at this point (where it already exists) baffles me. Seemingly the aphorism "jealousy, animal desires and pride remove a man from this world" is applicable here.

I'm talking about the open desktop drivers and chipsets model that Linux distros like debian and ubuntu are able to take advantage of and make workable for users. I just think there's demand for hardware open enough that would allow users freedom to install whatever os they desire more or less. I know that was the major hurdle for the above distros like 7-8 years ago where to get your wifi working you needed to use suboptimized software (madwifi) or ndswrappers for video hardware. Since then OEMs have released specifications more frequently allowing for OSs to be more free (as in beer).

Fringe in the sense that if schooling was left up to parents' discretion - most kids would still get some type of education. Just because someone doesn't get sent to college by their parents doesn't mean they're welfare cases and need the state apparatus to intervene. Schooling today is a business controlled by politicians and bureaucrats. Schools are funded by money that is directly taxed by the government. There is room for government intervention but not in most cases. I'll grant you standardized requirements at the federal level for subjects like math, science and literature but implementation should be left up to parents. Or at least their local representatives. That model works in other industries - the experts set standards and businesses follow. To what extent it should be done through coercive means is another question. Personally I think the threat of violence should be last recourse. That is public education in a nutshell. The way to fix it is by having smart people as rulers, but as that is usually not the case better to leave as much as possible of it to the market.

Out of curiosity, what benefits do you get out of spending crypto vs spending fiat? Seems to me that you'd have to *really* go out of the way to use crypto for mundane purposes to the point where you're just trying to make a point by spending it. The world can survive without Bitcoin at this point whereas it absolutely cannot sans fiat. So it's admirable that you spend Bitcoin and are being an activist but the truth still is that if you don't like Bitcoin you're at liberty to not use it. Not that I am advocating that, au contraire - I'm all for Bitcoin activism, but this is the reality of today.

Ok, so for that 20% let there be some government program, but leave the 80% alone. But this isn't the case. Government taxes each individual with the intent of providing schooling for the population collectively. This is completely unnecessary. Using coercive means (taxation and truancy laws) should be a *last recourse* and not a default option. 


No one is suggesting or promoting such a thing. 


Business is taking a good/service and selling it to make a profit. This is what politicians do with schooling. They package it to serve their needs - the perpetuation of the national myth - and along the way also hand out jobs to cronies to "administer" it. They all profit handsomely because they monopolize the market - consumers i.e. taxpayers, are forced to purchase and consume this good. Again, if politicians and bureaucrats were wise and benevolent then this wouldn't really be a problem but history has proven that this is usually not the case so why would any liberty minded individual eagerly promote such an arrangement? Are you a bot??


Implementation needs to be done ad hoc. Some families don't need any aid or advice in educating their children while others do. Most of the time this can definitely be achieved without federal government involvement. I don't think that's an unreasonable assumption.


Whatever. On the internet you can find all of the educational material you need for any subject. The top-down era has ended. This isn't the 20th century anymore.


Rules don't necessarily have to be enforced by violence. The threat of violence is enough. You obey the law many times because you're afraid of the repercussions of disobeying and getting caught. When you get caught you're arrested and thrown into jail - by force. If I was to do that to you it would be considered kidnapping, but when a state run police force does it it's considered law enforcement. Public schools are funded by the public. Why? For the 20%???

Yes you make valid points but I still think that a distinction needs to be made between pre-second industrial revolution world and the one preceding that. Without railroads, the telegraph, Bessemer steel or coal states didn't have the reach and authority otherwise. Urban populations only became the majority during this period. States in Europe became unified. Populations grew and were concentrated in urban areas thanks to job opportunities in cities (factories). Social and socialist agendas became in vogue and politicians pandered to the proletariat for the first time ever (universal suffrage). Public schools (to indoctrinate your children) were opened and run by the state - Truancy was actually punished. Mandatory health insurance was coerced upon the industrialists and other worker welfare agendas. Connect the dots. All this happened at the end of the 19th century beginning of the 20th. The world was set for strong centralized bureaucratic regimes which simply didn't exist beforehand.

At this point it's economically silly to seek alternatives. It's reinventing the wheel. Bitcoin has won. The only issue now is optimization, holding on to the title.

"Democracy" has become a meaningless buzzword which describes an oligarchy whose members are elected by popular vote and who then afterwards pretty much do whatever they want regardless of their "constituents" desires or interests. Democracy in Athens didn't resemble anything that exists in today's world. 
Electing representatives to a body that decides public policy only works in a homogeneous society (and usually on a small scale). That's the only way representatives can be held directly accountable for their actions, as there's a high probability that they are personally known to a higher percentage of the population and will face social consequences. Even then, public councils should have restricted authority and whatever can be left to the market to decide upon should be left to the markets.

Nevermind the atrocious fees it charges me for *every single* service I use/transaction I make. I even get charged for just owning a credit card.

Really? How's the coloredcoin space in Bitcoin doing? From the looks of it there are 4-5 different implementations but none of them are actually usable and their development has mostly pretty much been abandoned. Look at the GitHub pages of projects like ChromaWallet, coinspark, coinprism. Latest commits are from like 2 years ago - on all of them (sparkbit wallet for coinspark). If the devs of those projects would've collaborated on one single implementation instead of trying to go at it alone we would probably today have production-ready coloredcoin software. Instead, using Bitcoin for that purpose isn't practical and anyone in the market for issuing digital assets uses Ethereum or some other blockchain.

Bch by any definition still hasn't failed. It's the third largest crypto in the market and (along with the other top 5-10 alts) doesn't show signs of disappearing in the immediate future. Bitcoin still hasn't proven to the market that it's worthy of being "the one". It's dominance reflects this situation as it's at 53%, when it should be at &gt;80% were it truly the king of currencies.

I agree. I downloaded Greenaddress a few weeks ago for transferring Mycelium coins out of my wallet for the coin split, and the differences were *immediately* apparent.

The free market decided to give executive decision making powers to the group known as core. And seemingly one of their contributors has a strong opinion regarding a certain feature,  which is probably reflective of the sentiments of investors in general aka hodlers. Not every idiocy should be allowed to materialize in the hopes that the market will make the right decision. That's why homogeneous groups of human beings - as are hodlers (libertarians/anarchists) - appoint leaders: to make the decision-making process more efficient. All good to me.

New industries create a demand for new skills. Automobiles put horse and buggy drivers out of work, but they created new markets for an array of producers and consumers. The "machines are taking away jobs" argument is one of the biggest fallacies in economics.

You can have full employment and produce very little and you can have substantial unemployment and a thriving economy (in which many people are freed up to pursue spiritual and intellectual interests).

The assumption is that users know which chain they want to follow. As the bch fork has indicated, users who viewed Bitcoin core as the chain that is loyal to the principles on which Bitcoin was founded knew in advance which chain they would follow, and the ecosystem (wallet devs, exchanges and even miners) followed suit. Same thing with a POW change: if there is consensus among core that this would be the necessary step to ensure that Bitcoin remains true to it's original principles then users will be prepared. I've seen talk of contingency plans for the event of excessive miner hostility on this sub every so often for quite a while, so I disagree.

Honestly this isn't news. I've seen a few posts around here about miners returning miscalculated fees and the like. One time involved slush and the other ant. It's the honest thing to do. Also great PR. But that's it. Miners are secondary in the Bitcoin ecosystem, if not tertiary. The first being users, the second being devs and miners third in importance. They're service sector and it would be dumb for them not to cater to the demands of the former two groups. That's why I care more to hear about which miners are deploying segwit. Therein lies the true test of miner loyalty (and business sense). Stories like this are cute but a distraction (maybe even prearranged)

I thought about it for a minute or two and yes, there is some logic behind it: using segwit for regular transactions increases blockweight, but if you use legacy transactions then block size can't get past 1mb. Of course for your day-to-day purchases you use segwit for LN.

Even if segwit data would significantly require more resources, what's gained by running segwit heavily outweighs whatever additional costs involved. From an investor's point of view it's definitely worth it. 
From my understanding though, in reality, the additional resource usage required by segwit would be negligible where an instance of bitcoin-qt is already running. Basically, segwit wouldn't be what's stopping people from running a full node.

Let's say. But under whose jurisdiction is the Bitcoin blockchain? The notion of a state actor enforcing its laws with regards to activity on the blockchain is preposterous. It's counterproductive and unnecessary too: if you believe the market is on your side then it will produce the desired outcome even (and perhaps especially) without third party coercion. 
It's also a violation of property rights: Who are you to force someone to act against their own interest because it might involve monetary loss for you (a risk which you voluntarily took when you first bought bitcoin). 
Let Roger buy and sell whatever he wants, that's his right. I believe that the Bitcoin community knows what's right and will act accordingly if required i.e. mass dump bch for real bitcoin.

Who's "we"? And what capacity problem is there? If I want my TX to get through I pay the fee that my wallet tells me to pay and...TX confirmed (yes, I'm an idiot). 
And say we were to raise the block size limit to 2MB, would the capacity requirements not just be absorbed by operators of **full nodes**? Basically you propose that miners give discounts to users on TX fees while full node operators instead pay the costs of confirming a TX. That's a pretty dumb way to make TXs cheaper in my humble opinion. Both node operators and miners lose out in that scenario, and the tragedy of the commons is exacerbated. Please be consistent in your arguments, if you're gonna spread the FUD.

Actually being bothered about big G spying on you and not doing illegal shit can be mutually exclusive. Privacy is a basic human necessity. This goes back to ancient times wherefor example, it was forbidden to build a window within a certain distance of your neighbor's courtyard (among a few other scenarios; see Babylonian Talmud, tractate Bava Batra 1st chapter). Furthermore in many cases especially where public figures and freedom of speech is concerned there are many gray areas and the more anonymity/privacy you have the easier it is for you to express your opinion.

Edit: yes, many people will initially appreciate and get excited over receiving Bitcoin BUT as there's good probability of them losing interest quickly and forgetting that they even have coin never mind securing it properly, for everyone's sake it's better to not just "give away".

It's a nice gesture from Microsoft, but overall Microsoft is a corporation that operates as a racket: It vendor locks consumer hardware (sometimes I believe completely: see Windows phone), and forces consumers to pay a Microsoft tax every time they buy a PC (there are exceptions of course). So if I buy a PC I'm forced to pay for the windows OS. Not only that, but the software it provides its customers with is closed source so the user has no idea what the various Microsoft programs are actually doing. Nevermind that even if the consumer has no objection to running these mystery applications, they still are required to identify themselves in some cases to even use them. Seriously.

I'm not so sure about that... The main attraction of Bitcoin to me as an investor is its potential to be a viable alternative to fiat to the extent that it, in a good many cases, outright replaces fiat as a medium of exchange. I certainly am not waiting a lifetime for this phenomenon to occur as from my perspective Bitcoin's price is a function of its utility and I want to see returns on my investment as soon as possible. Historically speaking, commodities were stores of value precisely because people were willing to accept them in exchange for goods and services. Keep in mind that within the next few years we're going to see many layer 2 (and 3) solutions released for mass usage.

In fact, Bitcoin getting maligned by the MSM is actually a good thing...It means it's doing something right. Notice, anything that big media/big business supports is used as a tool for promoting the central bank one world government agenda - it's the bread and circuses used to placate the mobs by appealing to their most primitive senses. Thankfully Bitcoin doesn't fall under that category - for now...Therefore, bring on the MSM hate, even if it means mass adoption will be delayed for a few years. Only when the sheeple wake up and disengage from the MSM and its masters will they become liberated and thence wise enough to use Bitcoin. Until then, let it remain in the periphery as geek money.

There's a huge market for custodianship. Once there's plug-and-play software out there that will allow a full node operator to operate as a Bitcoin bank it's a home run. Software that allows you to configure money management for an array of hot and cold wallets e.g. multi-sig schemes that are defined by the user with a couple of clicks. Like a layer on top of traditional wallets. Lightning is already demonstrating some interesting possibilities. Finally it will all come down to branding.

I'm sorry but it's silly to focus on Bitcoin in the context of mundane small scale economic activity. Most of the daily USD/EUR transaction volume today is through settlements between nations and/or multinational corporations. The US doesn't have troops stationed around the world so that you'll be able to buy Ralph lauren online "without caring" - that's a footnote and byproduct of *international recognition* of fiat for the settlement of debts. It all stems from that. The **only** way for Bitcoin to become more valuable is for it to become the next petrodollar.

There's the commons - all property that isn't owned by private entities e.g. roads, sidewalks, parks, lakes, oceans, which from an economic perspective might make more sense to have under custodianship of a select group acting on behalf of the collective rather than to have in private hands. 
The problem with government isn't government per se - every society needs laws and an enforcement mechanism - but rather the indifference of citizens that allows those in power to commit crimes and abuses with impunity.

Exchanging for products is selling bitcoin for products.

And you're factually wrong: [Israel forcefully evacuated its own citizens from the Gaza strip in the hope that such a move would actually appease the Palestinians and give them an opportunity to prove that they are interested in living peaceful and productive lives in 2005] ( As predicted, that move was disastrous.

Your whole notion of what law is and how it works is flawed.

Under many circumstances, the decisions made on behalf of the public do *not* have its best interests in mind precisely because the law can be and is abused to promote injustice. Today it's politicians who decide how it works, tomorrow it might very well be (and the law would change accordingly). Try reading some Bastiat on the topic.

You unfortunately have no idea what you're talking about. In ancient times, when societies were tribal (and patriarchal) no central authority, unless it was a conquering imperialist intervened in local financial activity. The only interest was in exacting tribute. Yes, once these societies developed into monarchies the king had a mandate to expropriate property but usually he was checked by accepted practice I.e. common law and was at the risk of getting assassinated and/or betrayed by the populace if he'd abuse his authority. The biblical books of Judges, Samuel and Kings illustrate this point very clearly. So do other books e.g. the book of Ruth. When a society is homogeneous, and everybody is bound to each other through a very vivid collective history "regulation" is much harder to enforce.
Regardless, many groups in the American West apparently *did* function as anarcho-capitalist societies:

Never mind that there was no Arab presence in Palestine before the Muslim conquest in the 7th century.

Thanks that was helpful.

I then spend coins from this Electrum wallet using this same setup: would these coins that I'm now spending be traceable to my real-world identity?

How much income, guns, drugs, prostitution or anything worthwhile to surveillance was there for government to get involved in individuals' personal business? I doubt any significant amount. Most of society's wealth was concentrated in the hands of the upper classes and therefore government had no incentive to focus on the individual. Today wealth is distributed a lot more evenly so government has incentive to meddle in the individual's affairs.
But whatever the case, if you were a minority you enjoyed a lot less freedom a hundred years ago; it was accepted practice to discriminate against a particular race, religion, sex etc. Don't forget that Japanese Americans were interned in camps just 75 years ago. Certain ethnicities were subject to quotas in Universities until the 1930s.
And, when push came to shove, and government did deem it necessary to violate property rights of the individual it did so with impunity as the tyrant FDR demonstrated with his new deal and confiscation of private gold. Today, thanks to the internet we have recourse. Back in FDR's day they didn't.

The current "state" of Israel, which yes has some ties to the Rothschilds (but primarily one: Edmund - most of the others, especially today, aren't even Jewish nevermind Zionists) is a shell for a few institutions whose connection to Zionism today is practically happenstance. In fact you can say that the creation of the state was a Labor Zionist initiative. If the opposition Zionist had taken the initiative we might be looking at a different world today.

Big business and big government are practically speaking one and the same. It's a coalition of interested parties that controls the money supply and makes the laws. An oligarchy. 
Private and public are legal terms, not business terms. Most business is conducted on the basis of trust (assuming we're dealing with honest people). When I buy a product or order a service from a supplier, I don't care if the supplier is a public or private entity, because I'm doing business with a *name* and names have reputations.

You seem not to understand how the price mechanism works: a price reflects future expectations of the value of any given commodity. The only reason someone buys something at a certain price is because they believe that in the future the benefit enjoyed from it will be greater than the current price. If someone decides to "sit" on his money it's only because he believes that in the future this money will be more valuable. He is waiting for a better investment opportunity. Basically by saving, you are guaranteeing yourself the best possible investment opportunity, which in the aggregate is better for an economy than making a bad investment in the present.

Right. Also, it seems like the majority of internet activity (news reporting, shopping, socializing) is either under direct or indirect control of a few entities (Google, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft). I'd love to see an internet where content is completely controlled by users and not third parties. The [diaspora project] ( was a great attempt at providing a usable Facebook alternative and is still going somewhat strong (never seriously competed with Facebook but it still developed a user community). 
Maybe good things just take time but hopefully projects like ipfs (maybe tokenized with a Bitcoin sidechain to improve incentives for using) and OB can help chip away at the centralized internet's dominance. I also wonder if there's a vanilla Google desktop app suite available because the greatest invasion of privacy probably occurs when you use Google software with your Google account.

1. I agree, but I don't think it's that much different anywhere else. Anyhow, running away isn't a option for many people in Israel (even if they have other passports - because of ideology).
2. No doubt insurance is great, but it's hyper-regulated by the state; what if I run a programmed insurance policy as a smart contract on a blockchain? Why do I need all the human overhead that the current setup entails? State violence IMO is a function of money issuance - the moment state-issued money is rejected by the market in favor of something else, its ability to use violence is limited accordingly.
3. I agree - lending won't go anywhere and banks in that respect have a place in the world, but banks today lend on fractional reserves which frees up credit for bad i.e unproductive ventures that under normal circumstances would be rejected by anyone with any common sense. Instead cockamamie schemes get funded on the strength of PR and buzzwords, sucking up valuable resources, while contributing nothing to the economy. Look no further than the current ico craze, which is being inundated with basically free money. What value are any of these shitcoins creating?

From the first article it doesn't seem that weak demand was a function of deflation, but rather resulted from other factors such as demographic trends e.g. a shrinking population due to low birth rates over the past 30 years.
The investopedia article's claim uses the 1929 crash and ensuing depression as an example. But that was a sudden event so of course, if the money supply suddenly shrunk which it did the consequences will be bad. No one knew in advance how many dollars were in circulation and no one could prepare in advance for a traumatic event. The situation is completely different with Bitcoin: all actors know in advance the full extent of the money supply and can't really be taken by surprise. In fact, this is a much better situation because the correct information reaches all market participants allowing them to prepare in advance for a market event. Apples to oranges.
Hoarding is fine because no one hoards for its own sake. Hoarders are interested in eventually spending their money (otherwise there's no point in holding on to money!). They're just waiting for the best opportunity to spend their money i.e. they want to make the best possible investment. There's no value in pointlessly spending money as that wouldn't contribute to economic productivity. Hoarders in fact are doing the best thing for the economy: they're waiting for the best possible investment opportunity (the most efficient enterprise to invest in) that will justify them spending their money. This approach contributes vastly more to productive economic growth than pointless spending.

If governments just let people grow the plants they want for their own consumption the cartels' raison d'etre would be pulled out from beneath their feet, the same way the abolition of prohibition took millions of dollars (then) of income away from bootlegging thugs. And I can pretty much guarantee you that the cartels' usage of FRNs dwarfs their crypto usage.

I think to an extent you can (and this is already done today, for example, when I purchase a policy online: all I do is fill out a form and I'm given a quote automatically.) You're probably right though when it comes to pricing and risk assessment.




Has it? Did fractional reserve exist in antiquity? I'm really not sure. In any case, I have nothing against fractional reserve per se, as long as banks are held accountable for their negligence, which certainly isn't the case today as, as you pointed out, governments commit mass theft to help banks recoup their losses. This is the scandal.


Ok, maybe that wasn't what I should've emphasized. My point is that, easy credit lowers standards and encourages bad ventures.


Is capital not a resource? Where is all this money coming from? Who's issuing it and at whose expense? 
The answer is clear to me: the money supply is being diluted so that easy credit is available for schemes that don't bring any clear benefit for society as a whole. And what do I mean by "society" or "the economy"? I'm talking about the market for food, clothing and shelter. It seems that the more money there is for dubious ventures (Android apps that no one really needs, for example) the prices for basic necessities continue to go up. Tenements that are barely suitable for human living fetch ridiculously high rates while office space in luxury towers is abundant at very reasonable rates. This doesn't make any sense.


I think we're on the same page here...




Are you certain about that? Where is all this capital coming from? As the state is the only entity issuing money I would say that eventually the state is bankrolling these ventures. 


I agree, and I never said otherwise. The question is the source of the capital. I argue that the dubious source of the capital today controlled by institutions is a major factor in how this capital is spent. Easy come easy go, implications be damned.


I'd have to disagree with you here: IPOs are just a new scheme for parking venture capital. I don't believe there's demand from end users for these new currencies, i.e. people who go to the supermarket to buy eggs and milk (besides Bitcoin and a handful of other coins e.g. litecoin, monero, doge). Fact is, almost none of these appcoins even have downloadable wallets. What does that tell you about such a token?


I agree about the 1%. In that case then appcoins are a terrible investment! Your chances for ROI are 1%. That then means that we live in an economic environment where such a low rate of return is worth pursuing. What does that then say about the state of finance in such an economy? Doesn't seem right to me.

Coinbase and bitpay are in the Bitcoin business because it's a *fiat* business and can profit off it. There are no ideals behind their involvement in Bitcoin. They are attempting to amass power through owning their userbase and using their users' financial information as chattle to be sold to the highest bidder. If they were more forthright, they would just operate either just as exchanges or wallets. Not *both*. It's become very clear that their agenda isn't for Bitcoin to remain a tool for financial sovereignty but to become a payment system operated by a few large entities. The proof is in the pudding.

Correct, the only reason I pay taxes is because I have to.

I don't think this has anything to do with decentralization or anarchy but more to do with jurisdiction. Bitcoin businesses such as coinbase and bitpay are fiat businesses that operate under state law. Of course, a court's decision won't have any bearing on the software or its usage. It would only bind companies that are conducting business in fiat, which coinbase bitpay etc. are. In that case a group of Bitcoin activists using the state sanctioned court system isn't an objectionable proposal. It's just ironic because the courts have no jurisdiction over the Bitcoin network.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:03:32
Right, but they'll still know I made a payment and if the merchant is at some point identified then the whole world will know that I transacted with him. This is very different from cash in that if I give you $100 that's it I have no way of knowing what happened to those $100 from that point on.

You're right, though I was talking about the advice being given: it's not the best advice because there are better options for storing your Bitcoin than by a third party, unless it's someone of impeccable repute, which coinbase definitely isn't. 


That's not cut and dry: maybe OP is a majority shareholder in his business or it's structured so that he can use his personal name when conducting business. I personally am an independent contractor and I invoice under my own name. For tax purposes I am a business though. 
There shouldn't be any reason why OP can't install his own wallet and record his bitcoin transactions in his business's books.


Yes, very good advice but only as a short interim solution until he learns how to use his own wallet, which should be a priority for him and shouldn't take him more than a few days.


If coinbase released a wallet which would allow the user to solely own his private keys ( and under an open source license) like greenaddress or electrum then I would agree. But because coinbase's entire business is based on being the custodian of users' coin I would have to disagree. Coinbase's product is its users, just like all other centralized enterprises online (Facebook, Google, Amazon.


Why are you promoting an altcoin?


Ok, it's a less risky interim solution. Granted.

Only because federal regulations are so draconic. Otherwise, you would have unregulated exchanges (like btc-e) operating with impunity within the US to customers' satisfaction.

First of all it's more than 10%. See coin.dance for more accurate statistics. Second, because segwit is a soft fork, it is backwards compatible, which means that even if your wallet produces a non-segwit transaction it will still be included in a block. The full adoption of segwit depends on the wallet software people are using. Many wallets (primarily those used by services such as exchanges) still haven't upgraded their clients to produce segwit transactions. This is probably because of logistical issues and/or laziness. That being said a good deal of the reputable wallets such as greenaddress, bitcoin-qt, armory, BitGo, mSIGNA, GreenBits, Blocktrail, and NBitcoin already to the best of my knowledge implement segwit.

I'll keep it simple: you have no valid metrics for determining whether or not a g8 country like Italy is stronger than a multinational corp like GS not only because it is saddled under a huge amount of debt but because it is experiencing a deterioration of its very social fabric which made it powerful to begin with. It is also ruled by a central bank, an institution without a clear mandate - making it even more difficult to differentiate between public and private interests. And Italy and Greece are comparable in that they are both white european countries with low birthrates, high youth unemployment, huge amounts of debt and illegal third world immigration. The differences are mostly in scale and I'll concede that it will be more difficult for the banks to turn Italy into chattel than they did with Greece but when the musical chairs will stop a country like Italy won't be be spared by the bankster vultures (neither will the US) I.e. bail-ins and confiscation of personal property and martial law will be imposed. This has already started to occur with the negative interest rates.

Greece has already substantiated my claim. The international banks have taken over the country as was evidenced by the recent episodes of bailouts and Greece is no longer a sovereign nation. Italy isn't that far away: very low birthrate, crippling debt...the only way it can seemingly escape a fate similar to Greece's is by importing third world youth, which its shores seem to be washing up by the thousands every month. In that scenario though the Vatican will become a mosque within 25 years. If Italy does indeed tighten its borders to avert such a fate its only recourse would be to dismantle its centralized political power structure and to become a loose union of regional states.

No, you're half right.

I believe your you're​ mistaken on a few points:
* First of all, you can't have a medium of exchange that isn't also used as a store of value. It actually makes no sense to use something as a medium of exchange that doesn't also serve as a way to store value. Otherwise you have no incentive to accept this money in exchange for valuable goods and services.
* There's something called price system which is a function of supply and demand: Yes, the price of Bitcoin will rise if everyone holds on to it. Yet this isn't happening in a vacuum: people still need to eat and buy clothes and shelter. In fact food, fashion and real estate can also be used as stores of value so monetary value has multiple channels to express itself. Just think of Bitcoin as a commodity.
* Tastes and preferences change including nature of monetary supply. One day barley is popular, the next it's gold. Those who can anticipate such changes will profit as they're taking on additional risk. This is the nature of market economies.

Compare prices of basic necessities today to what they were 10-15-20 years ago...you will very clearly see inflation: milk, eggs, beef, cheese, timber, tools, real estate...all have increased if not doubled in price. Even the cost of labor has gone up - try ordering a technician to come over to fix something in your home - you'll probably be paying twice what you did 20 years ago. Not to mention lawyers, doctors, accountants, engineers etc. Their rates have all increased by %50 over the past 15 years or so. (Don't get started on the amount of taxes you pay either; those are just fees for services - of dubious value of course - that .gov provides you.) The only things that haven't been subject to inflation are the high tech toys and luxury products that no one really needs because those industries are practically subsidized by governments worldwide...thanks to the above "infusion of liquidity". What we have basically is an unprecedented type of convoluted inflation, a very apt reflection of the monetary policies of our central planners.

Disclaimer: I am in no sense anything of an authority on segwit nor on software forking. Having said that, from what I understand you're not forced to upgrade - your txs are still valid and are included in mainchain blocks. Notwithstanding, a situation is created where it's *preferable* for you to upgrade so you can take full advantage of the network effect - most of the network's clients will have upgraded and transacting with them might or might not be possible (refer to [this]
 (
Basically as long as old clients can be accommodated by the network, which is the case with segwit, there is no hard fork - your txs won't end up on an alternate chain.

Sometimes there is no choice but to resort to generalizations. It's difficult for the human mind to process exceptional individual cases when discussing groups.

(A) From an economic point of view you're incorrect: block size has no market value on its own - no one is interested in block space as an asset. People are interested in bitcoin and block space is just a function of bitcoin value. Comparing monetary supply to capacity supply is ridiculous if not misleading. (B) In economics, textbook definitions (or "behavioral models") should be mostly disregarded when dealing with real life situations because human desires and expectations can under no circumstances be quantified. Humans make (economic) decisions unpredictably and incoherently and projections on a "macro" level are futile and bound to cause many innocents much suffering. I think Keynes made that fatal mistake.

This is less an issue of fungibility and more question of rights stemming from possession. When you get a refund you are acquiring possession of money that was formerly not in your hands. You also need to take action - you need to file a claim for a refund. OTOH, when you circumvent paying a tax, you (in most cases) don't perform any action, nor do you take possession of something you previously didn't own. I'm not arguing for or against, I'm just describing a reality.

A hard fork is two separate chains, which would mean (assuming there are miners who haven't upgraded either) if Alice sends you money from her (also old) client that tx would show up on an *alternate* chain, call it legacy chain and your money is then gone from the perspective of the main (segwit) chain. **This isn't the case though**: With segwit being deployed as a soft fork, your money is safe and the tx is broadcast to the mainchain, even though you and Alice are both using old clients.

No, you're half right.

I understand but economic actors like coinbase wouldn't exist without  the hodlers. If they ignore the bip-148 coin then other exchanges will replace them. That's how I see it. Hodlers are the ones who should have the final say, and the market (for its own benefit) should follow their desires.
Yes, you definitely do your share from what I see you post on here - I'm debating the idea of "support", not you personally. Users shouldn't underestimate themselves (even though history has people conditioned to believe that strong centralized authority figures are the ones who make large scale economic decisions), and realize that a protocol like Bitcoin actually allows them to be the sovereign.

@_date: 2017-07-09 21:34:22
It's not a hard fork because if you receive a tx from a non-segwit address the network will consider it valid; your money isn't at risk because you failed to upgrade. 
The real question is though, if the majority of the network has upgraded, why haven't you? Anyone adventurous enough to use experimental money should be cognizant of the ecosystem and take full responsibility for their actions. There isn't a Bitcoin corporation that's obligated to take care of you. Be humble and be aware
@_date: 2017-07-14 10:33:21
I agree. According to the [segwit2x schedule] ( on July 26 their miners are required to signal for segwit (bip-141). If they don't then it will be the time to address the pessimists. Right now their concerns are mostly fud.

@_date: 2017-07-17 17:39:56
So, all that's required is 80% of miners to signal? And if a non-signalling miner finds a block the other 80% will reject that block? Seems like an improvement to the originally required 95%, no?

No, there is no voting but if big time hodlers express their intentions to remain loyal to the bip-148 chain in the circumstance of a chain split then you have an economic majority right there. 
This is open source software. What matters is what the users want and run. Miners, exchanges are auxillary in this economy. No one contributes to Bitcoin core because they want to provide  exchanges with  good software. They do it for the users, the hoarders (and exchanges in turn enjoy the results).

A store of value ceases to function as such once it can't be used as a practical means of exchange in the future. That's what gives it its value: the expectation that providers of goods and services will be willing to trade for it in the future. Otherwise why would anyone hold on to it?
If merchants will accept Bitcoin in exchange for their goods and services then by definition it is an alternative to fiat.

I think miners need to have something at stake to be fully trustworthy, where if it can mathematically be proven that a miner attempted an attack on the network it would lose whatever it gained previously through mining. Like having time-locked coinbase rewards, a smart contract with the network which can trigger a reversal of all previous coinbase rewards and distfibute them to the network in proportion to each output's stake. Thematically it would fit nicely with also having proof of stake...Miners would need to put up a sort of bank guarantee.

Who says that interest will be necessary for making Bitcoin a successful medium of exchange? It's possible that hodlers will have greater incentive to spend Bitcoin than lenders will have to borrow at interest. If most merchants were to one day decide that they only accept bitcoin then the lending economy doesn't necessarily have to follow current patterns especially because - I claim - using bitcoin isn't just a monetary decision but one that involves a re-orientation of social and cultural premises.

You were probably just trying to make a joke, but that's not true: use and value are inherently connected. Say, money is valuable because it's useful even though it has practically zero intrinsic value. As are works of art or religious artifacts. They provide inspiration which is evidently valued. Why do people pay money for a concert? Everything that's on the market for sale has some use for someone.

What sucks is that you need to have a Bitcoin balance to make a counterparty transaction. This isn't trivial, regardless if fees are half a cent or five dollars. You need to be managing two accounts - one XCP token and the other Bitcoin. There's no magical way users can just download a wallet and start swapping tokens seamlessly. I've brought this up on multiple forums (the XCP counterparty telegram groups, Reddit) and there seems to be agreement that in its current form the XCP platform is not an ideal solution for high volume token swapping. Rather it's a niche platform for already initiated geeks to create and trade collectables. I'm all for XCP as a concept but practically speaking it's not a solution for token creation and trading. I really hope RGB (or similar projects) take off as that would really be an advance in Bitcoin anchored token creation and trading.

That's because the white paper is a kind of "written law" whereas what Bitcoin is today is in a great deal defined by an "oral law" i.e. ideas that weren't specifically defined in the white paper but were apparently discussed in other forums and/or deduced by reasoning in line with the original intent of the software.

Fees were high because some fools decided to flood the network with spam and dust. Interestingly just as miners were making segwit2x announcements this stopped and fees are now back to normal.
But if anything those txs are done in batches. So the fees are divided by hundreds of people. It's like sending mail from the US to Armenia. Do you commission a plane to fly your letter alone across the Atlantic? No. You send it along with hundreds of other items of cargo. No one in India is buying coffee with bitcoin. That's for the retards Roger ver hangs out with. Today most of Bitcoin use is probably as a store of value, dark market activity and traders.
So, because fees are high your solution is to make running a full node more expensive. Ok, have a nice day.

1. No argument there: Bitcoin won't necessarily make money managers obsolete. Workers can save and entrust their savings with money managers who will then put their money to work in sound investments schemes.
2. Again, finance professionals won't go away. The only difference is that today, thanks to the convoluted fractional reserve setup, a lot of credit goes to cockamime schemes that a disciplined financial system wouldn't otherwise allow. With Bitcoin enforced financial discipline credit will be scarce and competition for credit will be abundant, giving investors a an abundant supply of investment opportunities. Hopefully in this hypothetical world due to these favorable market conditions (a greater array of people knocking on their doors seeking credit) it will be easier for savers to choose the best investments. As opposed to today where credit is cheap and almost anyone has access to it regardless of their terrible business ideas.

There's a cognitive dissonance involved with banks. People use them - for the time being - because this is what they know and is the most convenient option for handling money.

Bitcoin will eventually fulfill this function but the question is when.

That's the point of hodling. We're waiting for bitcoin to become more useful as a payment system (mature layer 2 implementations ) to use it as a regular means of exchange i.e. spending it. Hodlers believe that the economics of bitcoin becoming an easy-to-use payment system will drive the price up greatly (because it will become more  valuable as a means of exchange), which would then make it more attractive to spend. A self feeding loop.

No one should have to spend $200 to run a full node. I run nodes on a couple of old laptops and I plan to add more as necessary. I enjoy the luxury of knowing that I can be my own bank with old hardware. It's actually a feature of Bitcoin. 
There are other economics at play too. I'm one user out of millions. What if I'm in Ethiopia and want to run a full node? What does a 6 TB disk cost then? But forget about that, what do I now have to pay for the additional bandwidth I'm using? And what about my old CPU and RAM? Bigger blocks mean additional computation power.

When Bitcoin is worth $65,000 we'll revisit this conversation but as it stands now there is no justification whatsoever to increase the burden of running a node unless the network is in mortal danger (which it's not at least from a user perspective). 
Also, even if Bitcoin becomes incredibly valuable overnight, you still need to take into consideration people who live in places like India where making 5 dollars a day is considered a living. A full node in that situation would probably be run by someone with a fraction of Bitcoin servicing many other users like him in a place where hardware is expensive regardless of the value of Bitcoin. Not everyone is a store of value type of user. There are medium of exchange type of users who will be poor even by Bitcoin standards. Why discriminate against them because of some half assed solution that according to almost all of the experts doesn't truly solve any day to day problems and in fact actually poses risks not fully tested or understood (while you have a superior solution ready to be deployed right away).

Do you want a Bitcoin in which you can verify your own txs? Because no less is at stake right now. The talk about economic majority is irrelevant and a distraction. Anyone who's supporting bip148 isn't doing so because it will make him the most money in the short run (even though it probably will).  BIP148 isn't something a rational person would do. At least not according to economics. (Economics would dictate that having a  consolidated strong  currency is better than having 2 separate currencies). Yet why do it? Because economics doesn't measure belief systems and ideals. I will support a bip148 coin even if there was a chain split and value would be lost because the protocol retains its original integrity (but a chain split is unlikely to occur as game theory predicts that economically rational miners will want to mine on the bip148 chain, partially for reasons I stated above but for others more crucial perhaps). Think if you want a corporate China coin or peer to peer digital money.

In CNN's eyes a Palestinian terrorist ramming a vehicle into innocent pedestrians with intent to kill is an "accident". Gimme a break.

Totally! A lot of ma and Pa investor types who know I am a long term hodler - once they saw Bitcoin all over the news the past few weeks - started asking me about Ethereum, probably partially just to sound "in the know" but also because they're pedestrian investors who wanna make a quick buck and are looking for a deal. I tell them to stay away from that garbage: there can only be one chain to rule them all, Bitcoin is the closest thing we have to a truly decentralized currency etc. They quickly then realize that this crypto game isn't for them and they're better off making money the way they've been for the majority of their adult lives (these aren't fools after all). But a lot of greedy bastards out there are buying the shit out of Ethereum, and they're in for a world of pain.

Sell? We're going to 4000 this time. (I have no idea what I'm talking about)

That JimPhillips character is something:


Because you "need to make a living"? That is wrong on so many levels.

We're getting closer to killer app territory.

And if it isn't? But that's moot. What about bandwidth?

Why is this good news? Aren't they in essence making a commitment to hard fork to 2MB? That's contentious if you ask me and unless the experts are on board I wouldn't follow that chain.
