I've had ISPs tell me they won't help me any further if I'm not on a PC or Mac. And when I say that Linux is a PC, they insist that it isn't. Only Windoze is a PC.

BSD isn't obsolete... It's just evolved into a few alternate forks. It still has it's niche markets.

Sit in the garage while leaving the car running, make sure to wear SCBA equipment.
@_date: 2014-06-24 00:47:10
That's what I thought, and the guy had over 40 positive reviews in the last few months, so he wasn't a new account.
@_date: 2014-01-26 14:47:21
I did miss the reference, lol. Thanks! I'm not a BSD user myself, so I don't read much about it.

I thought this was AutoWikiBot! I was like, "Damn, Wiki got serious..."

This guy should sober up a bit before posting again...    
Edit: Thanks for the gold!

Dude, seriously. Go sleep it off and come back in the morning. Free electricity is sure to attract a serious miner in your area, but not when you scare them off like this.    
This whole thread reads like a crazy foreigner who is planning on stealing all their equipment, or worse someone who watched Human Centipede too many times.
@_date: 2014-04-02 02:25:48
That part was super!
@_date: 2014-04-25 18:59:23
You should accept !

So *you're* the reason it's dropping right now.

Looks like something done with a stylus on a screenshot.

Need to get back over 7000
@_date: 2013-12-18 05:08:21
I'm sorry. Thank you for replying to me! I will watch this show after all the great things you guys have said about it! 
But on an unrelated note! My wife and I have been using the name Konkey Dong for a few years to refer to stank dick! I'm truly sorry you had to find out like this.
@_date: 2013-11-14 03:14:09
How will that help you get a hoodie? Go to a thrift store and get one for like 2 bucks.

When can I use a debit Mastercard through my bank to buy bitcoins instantly?
@_date: 2013-11-14 22:44:31
@_date: 2013-11-06 04:23:34
Thanks for the heads up, I will look into Litecoin. Any quick info on how they are related to Bitcoin? Or how I change them into Bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-11-14 02:46:39
I have guns, we should go steal some 600 GH Bitcoin Mining Card's from their building. That would greatly expedite the positive ROI.
@_date: 2013-11-10 02:02:15
Checkout  too
@_date: 2013-11-06 04:31:21
Last ditch effort! I'll keep it in mind \^_-
@_date: 2013-11-06 04:31:01
It isn't loading for me right now, I will check back tomorrow! Thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-06 04:33:47
Very interesting, I will check it out! 
It's a pretty solid rig, as far as gaming and general computing, I'm running an old 6core amd, 8gb ram, and a gtx470. I'll hope for better results with LTC, lol.
@_date: 2013-12-18 02:02:50
I didn't realize that The Wire was done by HBO. That settles it! I'm gone watch it, thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-13 20:19:00
I just found this link and am reading it now.

It's a data file. 
It doesn't get carried in your wallet. 
It doesn't jingle in your pocket. 
0.00000001 is just fine. 
Stop trying to make it a thing.
@_date: 2013-12-17 22:14:05
Is it good? I haven't seen it yet. I hear good things about it. I should watch it... And Breaking Bad and Walking Dead... I need to watch more TV...
@_date: 2013-11-06 04:25:58
I'm workin on selling some stuff on ebay to fund some bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-11-14 02:40:46


I tried to register last week, but the miicard verification wouldn't send me a sms text. I will try again, thanks for reminding me!
EDIT: Thanks for reminding me! I just completed registration!
EDIT2: It won't let me verify my bank account as a checking account. Getting annoyed with Miicard!
@_date: 2013-12-17 18:45:46
Yeah, copper is only like $3usd a pound. It gets stolen because it's hard to trace and in everything. Appliances, newly built houses, abandoned houses, construction sites have it by the spool. It's mostly junkies that are stealing it, though.
@_date: 2013-11-10 04:54:26
So, you lost under one whole bitcoin? At least it wasn't massive amounts. Good luck on future coins!
@_date: 2013-11-18 02:13:34
They usually mark up. That $540 bitcoin you bought was going for $480 according to Bitstamp today, and Coinbase typically hovers around bitstamps price.
I like  for price checks. Use the gear in the top right to switch to mtgox.
@_date: 2013-11-06 21:38:48
Wow! That blows, so, how can I get instant bit coins? I can use a debit card, but I do not have a credit card. I don't want one.
@_date: 2013-11-14 02:29:53
I think part of it is that Butterfly labs isn't actually shipping the devices until after the difficulty goes up again. Not in a malicious way, just that they are slow to ship.
@_date: 2013-11-13 15:15:58
Did you get your USD back? Most likely they will not honor the transaction now that the price has gone up substantially and they already canceled your order. My suggestion would be to check into  It's a little above market rate, but may be a better option for you.
@_date: 2013-11-14 03:21:52
Check BTCQuick, I am having trouble with Miicard accepting my bank account and verifying my identity(small bank). But it's supposed to be a good alternative.
I did register with Coinbase and I get my first coins tomorrow. But I haven't had a problem yet(fingers crossed). But it will have taken 7 days through CoinBase.
@_date: 2013-11-13 22:11:05
I bought $100 when it was at $290, if coinbase doesn't cancel my order tomorrow I have .35BTC, valued at $140!  40% gain for the win!
@_date: 2013-11-18 02:20:02
Sell em at a markup of current rate and buy more instantly thus having more to sit on.
@_date: 2013-11-10 04:39:08
I just hope I can get in in time. It's taking me nearly two weeks to get coins from Coinbase. No credit card. 
And I don't want coinbase to kick me for being "high risk" when I buy in.
@_date: 2013-11-10 04:47:27
Yeah, I bought in at $290. I got $100 worth. 0.35BTC.  I really hope I can get more during the slump.
@_date: 2013-11-10 02:01:10
Check out  you will be kicking youself every second you don't have bitcoins, I know I have been, lol. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 04:24:19
Now we are thinkin!
@_date: 2013-11-14 16:13:58
It's a pain in the ass, and without a credit card it took me 7 days to get my coins. But it went through. 
@_date: 2013-11-13 20:26:08
Me either, I just found it on google and thought I would link it.

Fuck you. The majority of us are mid to late 20s working full time to support a family.
