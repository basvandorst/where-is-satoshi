Yeah and how is bitcoin doing in that fight? 
@_date: 2018-01-02 05:33:36
[An important point]( is that all these assets are not competing for one use case, a lot of the people that got involved in Bitcoin early they see everything as a crypto currency. They think everything is competing to be currency. Competing to be a form of money and payment. And with that perspective you can see why they are hostile toward any other altcoin that is not bitcoin cause they see it as a zero sum game. I used to see it that way too. My revelation came when I realized that all these assets were not all just nearly useful as currency but they were going to experiment in many different directions and do many different things.  ~~ Eric Voorhees.

Why don't you profit of alts?

Change.org? Bitcoin does not handle change very well, to expensive. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 09:33:53
"Why are you attacking ... the truth?" should be the new slogan for They should get rid of the Magic Internet Money one.
Paying over a dollar per transaction is not magic, it's evil
is not about money it's about investing in numbers and then telling all the other people that use other numbers that they should stop attackin my numbers. 
WTF? 
@_date: 2018-01-03 03:53:53
Bitcoin also charges a fee
@_date: 2018-01-26 04:29:53
How much Bitcoin do you need to get a channel going? 
@_date: 2018-01-03 03:33:40


Yes lots of lying, that is for sure.

If you want to solo mine you will need to invest a couple of million dollars in buying enough equipment so your hash rate is high enough to solo mine. Or you can mine with low hashrate and just be very patient, if you leave your low hashrate system running for a couple of years there is a chance you find a block, then you can include your own transaction in that block. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:21:08
Find a miner that is willing to mine the transaction for a very low fee. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:50:52
What if when everything becomes ready it's to late and users and business have already moved to crypto that does work with low fees and without the waiting time? 
@_date: 2017-12-26 03:05:40
I can confirm that this fake news is fake and so it is real.  
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:16:39
Yes but this only works because of the artiifikial limiet on the network, without it there could be enough transactions for miners to still make blocks with leow feeees. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:13:38
And on [this website]( you can see the most popular locations for that pdf ... and if the hashes are still the same, meaning nobody made any snakey changes. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:12:28
Sending bitcoin is not free. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:19:18
Yeah either we have ALL the transactions or NON of the transactions. Something in between WILL NOT WORK!

 does not allow you to read previews or see anyting other then  the title before you pay. It's not very active website and hardly has any feautures other then a 100% paywall that gets removed after you make a LN payment. It was created as a parody on  who used to run on Bitcoin, then litecoin and now Bitcoin Cash. They have created their own variant of LN and are doing routed micropayments on chain. It works pretty cool and it's growing fast in users. 
@_date: 2018-06-17 07:13:21


Why would an owner of a website wait for confirmations? And why are you comparing block settlement with open lightning channels? Did you close your channels all the time? 
@_date: 2018-06-30 23:38:39
Just wait until Bitmain does another attack on Bitcoin, you won't laugh then. We are trying to get everybody to run a full node so we can fight back against attacks, not this SPV shit. 
@_date: 2018-06-30 23:31:34
Bitcoin solved that whole problem, untill Core realized they could use the block size limit as a way to stop Bitcoin from becoming a global currency and then abuse LN to have a plan B incase plan A fails. Plan B is just to build a shittier version of the banking we already have on top of a crippled Bitcoin.
All you guys are getting bamboozled over here. There is 5 shills for every 1 genuine person in here. With the censorship and propaganda that started in 2015 and the fact that most people are non technical. Core did a really good number on you guys. Started a religion and now you are speaking their languages.
Bitcoin never got the chance to run in to scaling issues. Bitcoin Cash can do 32 times 400 000 tx per day, wich is enough headroom for the next 10 years ... I would say. 
Bitcoin-BTC will die once the generation reward runs out because tx won't go up anymore and if fees go up instead  people will stop using Bitcoin-BTC completely.
Anyway, make your own calculation and do your own thinking. Cause if you don't know how Bitcoin works or how LN works Core is going to successfully bamboozle you.

Because if you post something of value in this sub it will get removed.
This place is the most anti bitcoin place on the internet disguising itself as pro bitcoin. 
See goverments are not worried because of a bunch of quick rich schemes that have happened since the dawn of time.
Goverments are worried that there is a money they can not control. So they control this place and have charged theymos with the mission to make sure that this sub only ever promotes speculation and never actual use of bitcoin in commerce.
The biggest companies that use bitcoin in commerce? They are not even mentioned on bitcoin.org
Bitcoin has been hijacked and  bcash has liberated it again. And if you want to know the truth you are more then capable of figuring that out by yourself. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 18:43:15
A new financial system that does 3 tx per second with a second layer that is not suited for commerce.
You are being taken advantage of by a bunch of people that cashes out at your expense. 
@_date: 2018-06-30 23:35:47
SPV is not secure, nor will it ever be. Satoshi designed it wrong. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 18:43:56
absolutely. And since this place is not free ... you can't find the truth here. 
@_date: 2018-06-30 23:35:09
You can't put arbitrary data on the chain, that's spam.
Show some respect! 
@_date: 2018-03-06 09:24:37
Are the darknets not all using xmr over bitcoin nowadays? 
@_date: 2018-07-06 11:04:40
They will temporarily because some of them don't care about security to they sacrifice everything just to scale better.  THis might give  them a temp boost. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 08:30:41
The white paper has not been relevant in a long time, it should totally be rewritten. Satoshi go more wrong then he got wright. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 16:36:54
Roger Ver wasted 25 000 BTC on spamming the network and now he is completely out of funds. 
@_date: 2018-07-01 00:59:41
Because they hate Bitcoin and love the chinese yen. 
@_date: 2018-07-12 19:21:35
You are not allowed to think freely in this sub, so that's what you get. Conformity, a bunch of robots all repeating the thoughts of their leader which they believe they don't even have.

Bitcoin Cash could save that whole nation. 
@_date: 2018-07-06 05:58:56
I agree, LN is what is absolutely essential for the success of Bitcoin.
Without LN, altcoins will take over. 
@_date: 2018-07-06 11:03:45
exactly, and until that write cash layer  is as accepted as Bitcoin, Bitcoin is NOT money. LN will MAKE it money. No waiting time, super easy to use, no fees, and all the decentralisation and security of Bitcoin. This is how money works, it's always backed by a first layer of gold. 
@_date: 2018-07-04 14:33:28
The guy that created this meme is with the real Bitcoin, not the one in the sub here. So he got banned. Stop posting this meme. Bitcoin-BTC will never become money because the people in charge of it want it destroyed, not successful.
Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin, you will see. I wonder how they will attack it next time. 
@_date: 2018-07-06 06:01:30
Because Bitcoin-BCH has majority hashrate and Bitcoin-BCH has minority hashrate. But even if that would ever change Bitcoin Cash will keep the name Bitcoin Cash because language is important and we don't want people to separate Bitcoin from cash again, like what happened with Bitcoin-BTC. 
@_date: 2018-07-08 09:14:01
exactly, the insecurity of fiat is the worse thing in the world. 
@_date: 2018-07-01 00:59:15
That's right. Bitmain never wanted to make money. It's about China attacking the USA any means necessary.  Bcash is unamerican. 
@_date: 2018-07-01 00:59:52
SPV is crap. 
@_date: 2018-07-06 05:52:39
I agree but people keep pushing this stupid idea of using Bitcoin as money. IT IS NOT MONEY. It's digital gold that will be used for big settlement. 
@_date: 2018-04-30 15:46:21
I use Linux Mint. I don't see Ubuntu complaining about Linux Mint calling itself Linux Mint. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 01:12:04
Both BCH and BTC have a valid claim to the name. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 01:07:41
I don't think people believe this anymore. I believe Roger Ver's character has been assassinated. He was once hailed as one of the earliest investors in Bitcoin, and now because he believes Bitcoin is going in the wrong direction and supports the other direction, he is a scam artist? That's not how it works. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 01:13:03
That's propaganda. If Bitmain would move all it's hashrate from BTC to BCH the BTC network would die. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 01:09:43
Bitcoin Cash is decentralised, it does not belong to anybody. What did you smoke?
