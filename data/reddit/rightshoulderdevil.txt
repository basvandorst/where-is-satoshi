Oh cool. Bitcoin was able to accomplish that in three months. P.S. these shit end-the-fed get prepared for the ruin of the financial sector posts just makes bitcoin look fringe and Alex Jonesy...
Government only raises 75 billion a year from seignorage as opposed to like 3.5 trillion from other sources, if they wanted more of your money they would just tax you more directly...

So how to do feel about taxes? Seignorage revenue in the USA is like 75 billion. Total revenue is like 3.5 trillion. Given what the fed does to ensure our financial system doesn't collapse, keeps inflation predictable and helps stabilize the economy, probably getting a really good bang for our buck.

2% inflation - that is very stable - is not this wealth suck that you make it out to be. Seignorage is like 75 billion dollars per year. Compared to income tax which is like 1.5 trillion it's a rounding error. It's predictable so that interest rates can take into account inflation easily. It's not zero for lots of reasons (room to conduct stimulating monetary policy, sticky wages, etc.). Also when is the last time an advanced economy seen hyper inflation? Especially since inflation targeting has come to be implemented?

Friedman advocated consistent monetary policy that did not allow for discretion by the central bank. Nothing really to do with inflation per se. In fact, Friedman proposed an optimal policy that sets nominal interest to 0% which effectively sets optimal money growth as deflating at the rate of time preference... 
Too much deflation is bad since it leads to hoarding. Too much inflation is bad because it makes holding money expensive. Neither is better or worse.
