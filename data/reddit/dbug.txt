This is a very typical response for someone who is trying very hard to justify their decision to repeatedly dismiss Bitcoin, first when they heard about it years ago and then again and again as people kept bringing it up. I have seen it dozens of times. It's what keeps them from going insane from regret.

My point was that the whole jamaican bobsled stunt was more or less one person donating 90% of all the money, which is pretty sad for a community of 50k people who advertises itself as being so very generous. Looks to me like a few people are trying hard to fabricate such an image while in reality everyone is just tipping back and forth the equivalent of half a penny!

What? You're not supposed to flip a coin when deciding whether you want to invest in bitcoin mining or not. That's not how investing works. You're supposed to make an informed estimate based on different scenarios regarding the difficulty level. And if that estimate returns a positive ROI after your targeted time period, you invest. If it doesn't, you don't. Is that so hard to understand?

That said, your video comes across (to me at least) as the typical half-informed bitcoin bashing, bringing up some valid points but mostly repeating a string of flawed arguments that have been rebutted over and over and over already.
The problem I have with videos like yours is that they neither present a balanced view, nor do they offer any new insights. So in essence it's just spreading FUD, which isn't helping anyone.
definitely needs a balanced discussion, and people like you who are filling the role of the devil's advocate are necessary as well. But don't be surprised if you meet a lot of resistance from people in here if your arguments are as one-sided and unconstructive as the ones presented in your video.

What you are saying is nothing more than a fallacy. It's not possible to fix a failing economy by introducing some kind of virtual currency. How would that change the overexpenditure of the US as a nation? How would that reduce the growing national debt? It wouldn't. All it does is take the control over a vital aspect of the economy (its money supply) out of the hands of the people who are trying to provide a stable environment for business in America. So in essence, Bitcoin will only make things worse for the US economy.

If you have to make investment decisions based on what people on reddit tell you to do, then you should probably not invest in the first place.
But you know, Bitcoin really isn't just about investing. Buy some and play around and you might even learn a few things that will make your investment decision easier in the future.

Yes I know. But that makes you the sender of a new transaction. It's just confusing terminology to say the "recipient claims funds", because the recipient never does that. Once someone "claims" funds on an address, he always does that as the sender.

The Bitcoin protocol is what the majority of the network agrees on. The developers make improvements (in close discussion with the community) and then it's up to the miners in the network to decide whether they want to implement these changes or not. So the developers can't decide anything, they can only make suggestions.
@_date: 2013-12-02 00:06:33
The only way to recover those bitcoins is by recovering the file that stores the keys (wallet.dat). There is no other way.

@_date: 2013-12-16 02:59:34
I am on my phone so I will keep it short:
People using Bitcoin now are pretty much operating on the lowest layer of the technology. It's like saying the Internet is doomed because people can't handle the TCP/IP protocol. Obviously there is an abundance of protocols built on top of TCP/IP by now and most people don't even know what that stands for anymore. And all the services on the internet again are built on top of these higher level protocols. Noone designing a webshop even has to know what HTML is nowadays.
The same thing is bound to happen with Bitcoin. If you seriously think that people are going to handle their bitcoins directly on the blockchain level once it becomes widespread, then you are quite shortsighted.

@_date: 2013-12-07 19:44:59
There is always a chance that a transaction will never get confirmed. Every miner can decide whether he wants to include a transaction in the next block or not. The incentive to do so is a) the block reward and b) the miners fee of the transaction. 
Anyway, I have never had a transaction not confirm. And even if it happens, that wouldn't mean your money is lost. You just have to send it again.
And yes, micro transactions are a real issue. But I am pretty confident that good solutions will be implemented soon.

1. The 21 million limit for Bitcoin is completely arbitrary. It could just as well be set to some other amount. It would make no difference in the long run, as long as the units are freely divisible.
2. So why was the 21 million limit chosen? Most likely to make a single unit look more valuable to the uninformed public (aka the mainstream media) during the early adoption phase. Imagine if there were ten thousand times more bitcoins (or the decimal point was moved 4 places to the right, same thing really). Then 1 bitcoin would only be worth 10 cents now. The media, your aunt and the guy next door probably wouldn't notice bitcoin at all. But now with only 21 million bitcoins, 1 bitcoin suddenly is worth $1000. This gets peoples attention and helps adoption.
3. And the process of mining serves different purposes. First of all, it is a relatively fair way to distribute the bitcoins (everyone can participate). Second and more importantly, it provides an incentive for people to contribute CPU power to the bitcoin network. This is important because an insurmountably high hashing power in the network is necessary to guarantee its integrity (see 51% attack).
4. None of this does affect usability. If people are not comfortable using fractions of a bitcoin, the decimal point will just be moved accordingly. It does not matter in the slightest how many bitcoins there are in total.
Once again, all of this has been discussed many times already. I am just answering this because you made me feel bad for being so rude!
@_date: 2013-11-29 02:26:42
Holy shit... even the amount checks out more or less!
@_date: 2013-12-31 18:55:13
Simply because that's where we have been already. People associate a value of over 1000 USD with a bitcoin for that reason. And with a market cap of over 10 billion, it is big enough to still justify the necessary attention from merchants.
@_date: 2013-11-29 00:15:39
Ok, let me tell you exactly at what point in your video I pretty much dismissed it as FUD: You talk about losing bitcoins and how they can never be recovered, while with a FIAT currency the government can just print new money. Then you go on to say:


Guess what! This one simple quote of your video is enough to invalidate it as a basis for discussion.
Sorry for being so hateful again, but you said you had thick skin :P
@_date: 2013-12-04 01:31:37
But.. but.. it's so cheap now!!
@_date: 2013-11-29 01:02:59
Yes, at this point in time the price is driven by speculation. But a rising price will increase adoption by merchants, because they just can't ignore a potential $10 billion market. This creates opportunities for people to actually use their bitcoins as currency instead of just trading it for USD. And this again forces more and more merchants into accepting bitcoins because people are already using them. It's a self-inforcing mechanism. 
Obviously we are still fairly early in the game. But Rome wasn't built in a single day either.
And no, people will not "never spend because it will be worth more later". First of all, bitcoins are not edible. Secondly, the price will most likely follow a technology adoption S-curve, which means that price increases will become less and less pronounced over time. And last but not least, people really really like buying stuff (or why do you think so many people are in debt?).

I think you are overly optimistic both regarding the adoption of Bitcoin as well as the staying-power of current altcoins:
* Bitcoin adoption rate is almost zero. 0. ZERO. What we are seeing right now is 99% speculation and a few merchants trying to get free publicity by accepting this novelty. Almost noone out there owns bitcoins. Don't get fooled by your perception of a very very very small minority that is * Altcoins currently offer ABSOLUTELY NOTHING for anyone who is not in it for the quick money. They are not just 99% speculation, they are 200% speculation, of which the second 100% represents the deliberate pumping by their creators and early investors. I am pretty sure most of them will collapse.
The problem with any altcoins is that they actively undermine the efforts of the Bitcoin community by trying to make a quick buck from people who think that they missed the train, or from people like you who now somehow think that they should "diversify". It's all driven by greed, not by innovation. Innovation is just the excuse.
On the topic of innovation: Almost none of the current altcoins offer anything that could not be adopted by the Bitcoin protocol. That fact alone makes them redundant and irrelevant. And even if there was some real innovation, it doesn't have to happen RIGHT NOW! Bitcoins is "good enough" for the moment, and the focus should be 100% on building trust and helping adoption in the public. Once that has been achieved (we are a long way away from that point), then the discussion should shift towards new and innovative approaches.

Because the assumption that someone who replies with "No don't worry" to a question like this actually has no idea what he's talking about is so very unreasonable.

Ok, since you put a lot of effort into writing that posting I will try to explain why I think that the vast majority of the current altcoins are bad for the crypto-currency movement as a whole:
Bitcoin has almost all the properties needed to be used as a currency, except one. Unfortunately it is a really important one: Trust.
Most people don't understand what crypto-currencies are and how they are supposed to have any kind of value. You can't just tell them "it's like gold, only digital". That just doesn't work. They can see, touch and understand gold for what it is. But they can do neither of these things with Bitcoin. And that is why most people don't trust Bitcoin.
The only way to earn their trust is by establishing a general consensus in the public that Bitcoin is indeed what it promises to be, a trustworthy currency with real value. This takes a lot of time and work and convincing. 
And now suddenly these same people are not only confronted with one crypto-currency, but instead they see dozens or even hundreds of them! How does that help in forming trust? Most people will just think that everyone and their dog can come up with a crypto-currency, so why would any of them have any real value? 
That's why altcoins are hurting the movement as a whole, without adding anything of value. Once Bitcoin has established itself as a trustworthy currency in the general consensus of the public, THEN and only then is the approprate time to bring alternative crypt-currencies into play.
@_date: 2013-12-16 16:37:50

All mining helps to ensure the integrity of the whole bitcoin network. So even if someone is mining at a loss, he still increases the total value of the network and therefore the value of Bitcoin.

I think he is right, the average user will not understand these privacy issues. But there will be software that does all that for the user (blockchain.info has a very easy method for doing anonymous transactions already), and there will be additions on top of the protocol itself. So if Bitcoin becomes popular, the average user will not have to understand all these implications anymore.

@_date: 2013-12-21 19:47:37
It's important to remember that blockchain.info is not the Bitcoin blockchain. Blockchain.info is a web wallet and they most likely have their own internal ledger to represent the blockchain.
That said, when you go to that address on blockchain.info and select "Filter - all", you will see that a warning message appears and the final balance changes. In fact, every time you select "Filter - all" you get a different balance. I don't know why that is, but it is a problem with blockchain.info and not a problem with the Bitcoin blockchain.
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:17:09
Just ask yourself one question when looking at a new coin: Does this new coin need to be actively traded and have a multi-million market cap and people pumping it on twitter, facebook and reddit, or could the crypto-currency community maybe appreciate the innovative ideas behind it without its creators becoming rich on the backs of gullible people?
I'm all for innovation, but the current altcoin landscape is nothing about innovation. It's all about speculation. And Bitcoin brings more than enough of that to the table already.
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:23:46
Yes, you can roll back the whole blockchain and re-mine the block in question. Only problem is, the majority of the network would have to accept your new blockchain as the now valid one. Good luck with that.

Uhm no, there is no never ending chain. The last guy who buys the bitcoin for fiat is the one who provided the liquidity.
So Bitpay buys the merchants bitcoins, then sells those bitcoins on an exchange to whoever wants to buy them (exchanges usually don't buy bitcoins themselves, they only match sellers and buyers).

The usability as a currency is obviously an emergent characteristic from golds elementary properties. If you want to call that intrinsic or not is just semantics in the end. Bitcoin has all of the necessary properties to also be used as a currency, but it lacks the approachability of a simple and tangible asset like gold. This can only be replaced by trust built on a general consensus that Bitcoin is indeed what it promises to be, despite the fact that almost noone understands what it really is.

Sender. Most wallets let you specify whether you want to pay a fee or not and how much you want to pay. The amount of 0.0005 btc has been the suggested default for a while, but nowadays the suggested default is 0.0001.

Yes that is indeed the question. But you did not address that question at all.

Of course someone looking to get into the mining business will have to adjust for increasing difficulty, but that's a given.

Currently the sentiment regarding the valuation of Bitcoin is a bit uncertain. This leads to a lot of people waiting on the sidelines to see what the market does next. Once there is a trend forming (for whatever reason), the undecided people jump in again and go with the tide. The result is a lot of sideways movement (everyone waiting to see what happens next) followed by quick jumps up and down (everyone following the market movements). Any movement up or down can be triggered by rumours, whales buying or selling, trading bots getting in a feedback loop etc. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 17:03:09

All valid question. However, the current financial and monetary system is also extremely top heavy and controlled by a few very wealthy and influential individuals/families. Bitcoin will definitely not solve the problem of inequality, as that never was its goal or intended purpose. However, it offers a far more open an transparant approach, therefore at least leveling out the playing field quite a bit.
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:37:23

What's your point? If I wanted some altcoins I'd buy some. I don't want any. They offer nothing except making a bit of money while it lasts until it doesn't last anymore. Have fun with that.

So just like the rest of the world? What an outrage!

Of course, innovation is always a good thing and there is nothing wrong about competition. But unfortunately the current situation is that the vast majority of the altcoins out there don't offer any innovation over Bitcoin. So the competition is not about different innovative approaches, but rather about gaining as much speculative money as possible for the financial gains of the ones already invested. There is nothing idelogical behind all of this, only greed.
The reason the Bitcoin community appears to be so "fundamentalist" when it comes to altcoins is the fact that altcoins only add a lot of confusion to the general public about the legitimacy of Bitcoin and ultimately about the legitimacy and trustworthiness of a crypto-currency in general. So all they achieve by pushing copycats of Bitcoin as the silver to its gold is jeopardizing the success of the movement as a whole. And all just for the chance to make a quick buck off some gullible people who think they "missed the train". It's actually quite despicable in my opinion.

Well that list is just the sum of their price money. Most of these players also have sponsor deals and even team salaries on top of that.

Not many investments generate a positive ROI after only 2 months so I don't know what you're trying to say here.

That is not necessarily true. It's just as likely (actually even more likely) that the whales in the market buy up the small guys who are panic selling, essentially increasing their already large bitcoin holdings at the cost of small holders.

Yeah it's unbelievable. It appears people buy everything that somehow has coin in its name. I should make an Idiotcoin and sell it just to prove my point.
@_date: 2013-12-05 18:08:02
Namecoins are arguably one of the notable exceptions, even though I believe the implementation is flawed. Still not many people care.

I agree. This is getting extremely annoying. From now on I will start reporting this kind of dogecoin spam.
@_date: 2013-12-03 14:55:56
bs. XRP price is the result of the ripple creators keeping the supply of their premined units artificially low. It has no significance at all.

If you look at my posting history you will see that I treat litecoin the same as all the other altcoins.

Absolutely. Traders, even stupid ones, are never bad for a market. What is bad for Bitcoin as a whole however is "ordinary people" who are not really experienced when it comes to trading (especially in a highly volatile market such as this one) getting burnt and losing money and ultimately losing interest because of this. And the even bigger problem is, that pretty much everyone who owns bitcoins can use them to trade right away, so there are almost no barries to entry. This means every idiot can go ahead and try to beat the market without anyone informing them of the risks and telling them that it might not be such a good idea. So I am pretty sure a lot of people are losing money here.

I am not sure how exactly Bitpay operates, but I would assume they are using some sort of optimization algorithm to come out ahead of daily price fluctuations. They probably want to keep the risk of doing that pretty low so I would guess that they are re-selling the BTC rather quickly.

I sat through the whole video even though that (fake?) accent made me almost throw up. But it's just another regurgitation of the same old issues without adding anything new at all. So what's the point? All these issues are being discussed in a serious manner elsewhere already.
