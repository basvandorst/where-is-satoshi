You can abandon it but I'm going down with mine confident she will float again and prevail!

I did the same not long ago and I'm going to add to it what I can afford every month and a slightly larger amount when it dips. It's exciting times!

What could they do to stop it happening? Haven't they already tried to stop it with the media narrative being that Bitcoin is the currency of drug dealers, hitmen and child pornographers? What else could they do? Couldn't there be a potential power shift in which the countries that decide to adopt bitcoin earlier become the more powerful countries later and the ones who don't lose the power?

I made the mistake of not listening to Max Keiser and thinking he was looney 6/7 years ago. Never again.

Would have to drop significantly in price and then rise again

Fuck off mainstream media. All they do is scare old people. Nobody believes their shit under the age of 60.

Just HODL it will go up even further

Why is it impossible? Genuine question as I'm relatively new to all this!

25k by Christmas!

If our wallet apps are acting strange is it down to the price or is it a sign to move bitcoins? My wallet app on my phone has been telling me I have no money on a few occasions that I have logged in today.

Thank you for the information, non almond eater.

Localbitcoins is your best bet. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:32:44
Lol those were the days! This is what excites me the most about it though. Back then unless you had an extensive knowledge of computers you couldn't dream of where the internet was going to go. In twenty years it established itself as being a must have item. I can't wait to see where Bitcoin is in the next 5/10 years!
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:27:13
Yeah that seems likely. Exciting times ahead though! Where would you place Bitcoin on a time scale right now? For example I've heard a lot of people comparing it to around 93/94 in the internet which was basically infancy, would you agree with that?

Investment short term. Currency long term.

Buy. Buy. Buy. We've hit a 10k wall and we need the help of Mexicans like yourself to help pay for it to be taken down.
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:20:25
It still won't be too late even then! 1 trillion in the next 20 years!
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:16:03
How? It's still in it's infancy stages isn't it? It's got a lot of coverage right now but we might all be noticing the stories much more because we look for them . I don't think it's reaching the masses through the mainstream quite yet because people were saying the same things in 2013 when it started to break through.

Holding on to Bitcoin and not selling. ��

Yeah this. You will drive yourself mad checking every day.

Don't make me orangery!
