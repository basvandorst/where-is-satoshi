Bitcoin isnt advanced technology at all. It is extremely simple for its job. Like everything should be. The coders knew what they did and didnt have to make it complex. I'm currently trying to make a script that parsed the blockchain and its way easier than i expectdd. Thought i would screw up and quit not even 50% in but im soon done. I bet anyone willing to spend the time reading sould understand to a really high level. Not talking about memorising hash256 algorithm but basically everything besides that.
The only issue I've had are some random transaction scripts doing god knows what. But apparently the blockchain explorer doesn't get it either so im not ashamed.

A little bit of headspace is common but its hard for stores to keep the price exact with the current fluctuations. Try another store and see if they automatically updates their price, might have better luck there.

I got a ledger and I'm quite worried too. Would like to load up my own seed and will look in to that soon, haven't had the time and dont know if its possible. 
So my conclusion is that there is two reason to be paranoid, intention and skills. They might hack yo shit. But they might also be nice people, its an legitimate business with names and addresses. Bitcoin is in fact used by people who likes to interpret the laws in their own ways. So they would probably price the thing to a price they are satisfied with and not risk "people hiring black market assassins" or w/e people do this days when the get pissed off.
But my main concern is the hacky bits. Even if they try the best they can to secure the stuff, they might be complete rookies. Or they might be pros, just someone else that is better with extra time on his hands. How do I know that the seed(not wallet seed) they use to generate random number is secured. Computers are not to good at handling "random". If you figure out how they do random, there would be a tremendous change in bruteforcing wallets seeds. That change might make it possible and worth while to bruteforce wallet seeds.
That said, I am completely tsking it for granted that it is offline, i have not checked this myself. But that might as well be horse shit, it could possibly upload your seed to a server every time you plu it in. But I think that someone would have checked that and it would have been noticed by now.
Maybe i should just make my own wallet for cold cold cold storage. Generate a wallet offline that i never use at all. Use an arduino or some shit. Just a wallet and an adress to stock it up. And never connect to anything. I was paranoid before bitcoin, this is going over my head :(

I think about when quantum computers or something hits off and CIA, NSA or whatever letter soup get a hold of them before anyone else and can start sweeping up everyones wallet from right under their noses. But i figure all hashing and encryption functions will take that hit, hopefully they have something more valuable to focus on. But im not sure how bitcoins will evolve from that. Is it possible to "upgrade" the system to new encryptions or will there have to be new forks and everything running out in the sand?
@_date: 2019-07-05 05:36:18
Just because someone lies doesn't mean they wont be continually targeted by scams... outing your wallet amount or any wallet anount is stupid. Braging to strangers at the cost of being spammed by scammers. If i ran a scammy deal i would scrape the hell out of these subs, as soon as someone mentioned a whole number in before the letters "BTC" I would add them to my target list. Even people like you who write others balance. There is simply no reason to do it, and people are either to stupid or have to much of an ego to figure that out.
Bring on the change of rules, the people oppressed by the change is to stupid to realise it liberates them more than opresses them.

It isnt simply the number 100k but the current value of 100k that is the point.
@_date: 2019-07-16 00:52:12
5k is 50% of 10k. You didnt start with 15, you started with 10. If you count total, your profit is 33% of the cake, but 50% of the input. Dont even know your serious or not.
However, if bitcoin raises to 21k, you made 110% profit, but you can only possibily loose 100% of your input. So the percentages are on your side.

Legitimate thought. Bitcoin will replace fiat in the future when it goes off, that means banking families will loose their wealth and power. Their ownly hope to maintain that wealth and power is to keep people from using bitcoin. They cant buy every single bitcoin but they can fuck with the market. And they are quite good at it, they constantly fuck with countries currencies for their own profit. The better it goes for bitcoin the more fuvkery you will se, until we win. Then its citadel time.

Yea. Don't know how it works in the us but in Europe refugees is given billions in tax monies.

Which exchanges does this? And where do any user say they agree? It the fed has pushed laws for this behaviour its one thing. They hate all bitcoins equally but they cant do anything about it, of course they are going to fuck with you on those points. Doesn't mean anyone else cares. Especially not when the coin is just a few extra transactions away from being clean.

They can easily "seize" bitcoin by just offering a ridiculous amount of money for it. Thats kinda my biggest fear. The people owning the banking system got so much money they could technically offer everyone "an offer they cannot refuse" and it would be pocket change for them. However everyone would be mostly happy, the issue comes to them being cheap. They will not buy everyone out. They would by a big amount, pump and dump and just fuck with the value.

In 50-100 years computers will have evolved to enough to bruteforce wallets. There will probably be a change of algorithms and all old unused wallets will be mined.
Until then each lost bitcoin will increase the value of bitcoin. I had a wallet way back in 2011 or something where i mined 2 btc from my desktop. Back then btc wasnt well known and i didnt care enough to keep the coun so i lost them, fuck past me, as well as the genisis wallet holds 50 btc said to be unmovable. However no btc have been moved from that wallet so make it an even 70btc. 
This means there will only be 21mil-70btc(technically) so all other bitcoins share the value of the lost coins. The bitcoins value comes from demand, if the supply is missing the one who really demands btc will offer a bit more.

Yea think your the one that needs to read up. He just said he was going to use a usb stick in the post above.
And that is just one out of a thousand ways to infect a computer beyond the ethernet cable.
Qr codes are just representative ones and zeroes. It is not hard at all to spread viruses on them especially since you cannot decode them yourself and need another program to do it for you, using that program to execute your code is not rocketsurgery. Would you be able to tell the difference between a clean qr code and a tampered qr code with your bare eyes?
Yes stuxnet would be useless as you dont run a nuclear reaction. Its the execution that is the valuable leasson. 10 years ago people thought a computer you run offline and hide under a mountain was safe from hacking. They were wrong and got hacked. Think people have forgotten different ways to hack computers or come up with new ways the last 10 years?
And how would you get the tools to even create the transaction qr code without any input to the rpi? Asuming the chips on the stock rpi is not tampered with, need the rpi distro, bitcoin client are you going to rewrite all that code just so you dont get to plug anything in the rpi? How do you generate your wallet?
So many attack vectors that its laughable you think your hack proof. Not even hardware wallets are hack proof and they are tested and a well thought idea. You bring some stoneage idea that has been hacked multiple of times before and think thats better?
Even if we live in your fantasy and you wrote every row of code yourself. Controlled everything to the last byte and managed to get a fully running computer with bitcoin client and not a single virus, backdoor, bug to abuse. You still have all kinds of crazy tech that can still hack you. Van eck phreaking and whatever people come up with. You gonna hide that computer under a mountain, build a farraday cage around the mountain then hide that mountain under another mountain?
Let me teach you something you will be able to use for the rest of your life; nothing is unhackable. Everything that can be created can be destroyed. It only takes the right amount of time / incentives. Thats why you need to stick to the latest proven security and not the oldest disproven security. It will give you time to upgrade to the next thing before the current gets broken. Sorry to burst your NCIS bubble about hacking.
But like i said. Please use those techniques. The easier it is to steal your coins the less focus they will be giving mine. Please try to implement your own encryptions or whatever makes you feel safe.

There is also constantly trashtalk about coinbase on this sub. Why would you care where the coin was before you? Its still the same value, if your afraid of the coin being dirty send it to yourself again a couple of times and it will be "clean". That a coin was mined by satoshi is more of a sentimental value. Cash is concidered fungibel even though people like to collect coins stamped at their birthday and what not. There is a difference since all coins will always have the same value. But there will be a bigger market for freshly mined coins etc, its just their loss. They are not really "worth" more unless they find some other collector with the same sentimental thinking.

~~You cant send a bitcoin transaction without internet. You need to get access after you have made your offline transaction. Do you really think you manually sending the transaction is faster than someones script emptying your wallet once you get that connection?~~
~~For thinking your so smart you definitely dont think of all the multiple possibilities...~~
~~Even if you buy a new computer straight out of stock. Its infected with all kinds of backdoors, from the bios, the processor to the network card.

By the time miners dot get block rewards the processing power will have incremented to the point you could mine sha256 wallets, all lost coins will be mined into the chain again. But the incremental popularity of bitcoin will keep deflating it for a long time. Until the market cap equals all money. Then that satoshi will be "worth millions" to your grandchildren.

Bet you program your qr code readers in scratch... Hah! Gotcha!
Do you actually think that matters, do you really think that if I just didn't understand that pdf then qr codes would magically become unhackable?
And if that pdf hurt your feelings so bad let me rub it in a little bit more, i didn't even read it. Just posted the first hit when googling "qr code injection", why would i spend the time reading a report to convince you something the dumbest qr code reader programmer would learn the first thing when programming a qr code reader?

Not decent enough

Depends on the seller/buyer, they can request verification to trade with them. However localbitcoin does the verification. You can ask other users to verify it to for more verification.

Maybe the AI could predict its own effect and incorporate that? Wouldnt take to many predictions for it to learn if you just go with todays machine learning algorithms.

Is there any schedule for when all these forked coins cane about? I had 1 btc coming and going during 2015. Would be nice to match the date to the creations of the forks to see if i still have some left hiding somewhere. Is there any values in these coins or will 1 btc just be a waste of time?

Whats the deal with this. Im not a douche just quite new to not just buying and using bitcoins. What do you gain from running a bode? Is it like a node in the tor network? You keep the machine running or is it some mining thing?

Maybe, but i see some flaws. Bitcoins is just a representation of value. It will not change the pricing any more than another representation of values like fiat. It just distributes the value more fair. Banks cant creat money making themselves richer like todays fiat. Capitalist will still sell stuff at the most expensive price they think people will by it etc. Whether they buy sucks with 1 socks worth of bitcoin, 1 socks worth of sats, 1 socks worth of dollars or 1 socks worth of marshmallows. Dynamic pricing would only be a thing, no matter what currency, if people decided not to buy so much garbage. And we know thats not going to happen any time soon. How many people dont you see with $1,500 iphones?
Sallary will be the same. People in china will get 1 sat for the same job as someone in the us does for 1 btc, just like today. Chinese dont make the same yens worth of dollars for the same job. Its basically just an easier way to transfer money between countries. Instead of the chinese exchanges his yens to dollars then trade.

But we have a world economy. The only difference is that it takes one extra action. But a lot of countries take dollars, the us could probably pay chinese workers in dollars. They just use yen for the convenience. We already have a world economy. The difference bitcoin makes is transfering the money faster. Basically you could rename yens and dolars to the same thing and you would get a slightly slower version of what you are saying. What exactly would eleminate the capitalistic interest?
People in poorer countries would still make less money, cheap companies would still outsource their work to earn more. 
Countries are not richer than other countries because bankers have gotten together to vote on which currency they like best and should value the highest. Its based on the countries work, export and imports etc. All thos factors will still be the same no matter what they choose to use as a representation for their wealth. There is nothing really concrete behind your idea that would change those fundamentals.
Its like saying all phones will cost the same, an old dumbphone would cost the same if you buy it in india as if you buy the newest iphone in canada just because you pay for them with bitcoins.
Bitcoins will not change the value of wealth, its simply just another representation of the wealth. You can change the physical dollar bill, even change the name. It would not change the value of the bill.

And what does it do?
@_date: 2019-06-28 20:06:02
How do you think it will change? Chinese people could today just exchange their yen to dollars and it would be that scenario.
@_date: 2019-06-28 23:54:19
Well. Immigration is fixing that. People that doesnt wanna work or fix their countries and just get free stuff is emigrating to rich nations while the people whos left behind is either to poor or willing to do the hard work. It isnt really making all the countries greater, rather making good countries shitty and vice versa leveling everything out. 
But is that really what you want? If everyone was equal would everyone suck or be awesome? Perspective is what makes you happy. If you never felt bad in your entire life. Feeling slightly less happy would be the worst you felt. That would make you as sad as the worst you ever felt now in the real life. We base our wealth on the lack of wealth for others, or their advantages. It is not possible to make a world where everyone is happy all the time etc.
You need to be down to appreciate the times you are up. Maybe a bit philosophical. But if scify movies taught me anything; there is no magic pill to solve sadness etc. But there is value in that. Everyone is good at something, if that something is usefull or positive is another question.

Fiat only has a value because we all agree to it because we all like to trade stuff. If your paper bill doesn't look the way im expecting it to look i will not trade it for my smartphone.
Same with bitcoins, it has value because we all agree it does. Difference is that no body can make their own out of thin air and ruin it for everyone else like fiat.
Fiat mantained its value while no longer being backed up by gold. Why do you think make fiat worth anything?
In fact what gives anything value? Everything is worth what someone agrees to pay for it, as simple as that. If everyone decided to starve, the most important we have, food, would be completely worth less.
