There are various options that people can still use to buy bitcoins. That's not really the issue as far as I see it.
The problem is really that they are forcing exchanges in Sweden either to go out of business, or to move underground. 
If bitcoin trading inside Sweden has to move to a black market then the banks can just declare outright that it's use is primarily for criminal purposes simply on the premise that it's operating outside legitimate regulated markets. 
My primary concerns is the public perspective of bitcoin as a voluntary, legal means of exchange between parties. I foresee articles being printed in Metro saying it's only for criminals and that people should stay away from it.
I expect more of the same from banks around world quietly taking this approach without raising too much of a fuss in the media. 
I think we need to call them out for what they are doing.

As far as I know, not yet, but I haven't spoken to them for a while. I think it is only a matter of time though.

I think we will be forced to, but we're really going to have to come together as a community first to pool our resources because it will be an expensive legal battle.

Coinjar moved from Australia to UK to avoid the GST. They work ok, but you need to register with photo I'd. You just bpay and the funds will appear a few days later.
