Then why are you here in this subreddit still if you have no interest in bitcoin? Bitcoin is a store of value that I believe has merit to the world's economy. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 07:37:24
Now you're just being dramatic. Crypto is not like scratchers at all.
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:19:04
How about wealth not being determined by a government that prints as much as they want. This is our only damn chance and it's a long shot but unless you like being under the thumb of our government and by that I mean corporations maybe you should start seeing the upside to btc.
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:53:23
But truth be told you have no clue like the rest of us.
@_date: 2018-01-31 17:24:40
No everybody does not assume that, not sure why you would think that. But it's pretty safe to assume someone preaching hodl back then he probably believed in the tech and filled his bag.
And it looks like another redditor followed his thread and he was still holding in 2017. So yeah, I'm sure he's doing well and not broke.

@_date: 2018-01-22 20:56:41
Dude has a point. It can keep going up as time goes on. More people, more money circulating, more uses for btc as the tech improves. It might take longer than some people are willing to wait but it will eventually have an upswing. I mean there's no guarantee the sun will rise tomorrow but it probably will.
@_date: 2018-01-18 17:43:17
If you can't hodl for a year don't buy. You get a tax break on the gains after a year anyways so look at it that way before you buy back in.
@_date: 2018-01-31 17:34:45
In Crypto....yes. People are freaking out. Can't wait to see the madness when it hits 30k and goes back to 20.
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:52:39
Bought at 12k...holding some btc and also getting some super cheap sales on alts. I was about to thrown down $1500 on EOS now I'm gettting the same amount for $900. How about No Limit Coin was waiting for it to creep back down to a quarter...its now aout 21 cents. I believe in these projects and know they have a future. The money is made during these bloodbaths.
@_date: 2018-01-31 17:15:18
If you say so. I know a lot of crypto junkies that don't really fuck with reddit much. A lot of intelligent people don't spend time on reddit at all.

The internet bubble is often referenced by the Amazon swing from $100 a share to $7. Only to then rise to $600. That's a bubble. That corrected back upwards.

@_date: 2018-01-17 19:14:18
But more truth be told BTC doesn't usually hit it's floor and stay there. I once bought at a floor of $1800 and it lasted about 5-6 hours tops before it was back above 2k and on it's way to 3k.
@_date: 2019-07-12 05:05:40
Not really, lol.
@_date: 2018-01-23 02:27:05

The hodl motto is fucking battle tested man. At first I thought it was overblown but if you believe in a project and just hold and not try to play the volatility you are much more likely to benefit as an average investor.
@_date: 2018-01-17 08:16:52
Pump n dumps are generally bullshit and not useable. I've purchased goods and services online with BTC from many countries.

It's a joke calm down
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:13:31
Haha yes the bubble will pop just like the internets bubble popped. But hey, the tech is what blew the bubble up and even after it pops the tech will still be here and so will the gains for the early adopters. I mean I've already made more than I made all last year in gains. So I can't say I'd cry too hard if it went to 0 today. 
@_date: 2018-09-13 14:16:07
This is not a tech issue, it's market emotions. If it's tech that motivates the market superior blockchains would be gaining value.

How can a volatile investment like BTC ever be foolproof? Things will probably turn around.
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:41:15
I know that's what I'm saying. Just because the bubble popped doesn't mean the tech goes away. If bitcoin falls another coin will take its place. That's why I'm diversified.
@_date: 2017-12-15 08:31:46
Bitcoin will crash and rise again. facts. Get your digi gold or mive on and keep slaving for that phony fiat.
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:49:14
You are sorely mistaken if you think Wall Street is getting knee deep into bitcoin. You think they want you to know that? Of course not the more people that figure it out the higher the price will go thus making it harder for the whales to attempt to control it. Which they can't.
Gold will still be valuable....just less so. It's moving over for it's digital cousin. Like it or not. The world not just Wall Street and the American Markets but the world is moving to the blockchain.
Good luck!

Gold is ugly and out of style, forget gold and diamonds for that matter. Archaic trophies of the past. The Bitcoin and other coins like it are a utility and is the undeniable future of trading value. You honestly want your money in the banks? You trust them investing your money with no payback while they print out more and more useless green paper?
I want to be able to send 10k to my sis in Australia in a matter of mins with little to no fees. The blockchain solves this problem.

How easy would it be to hide a ton of BTC from the FEDS at that point in time? They had no idea what they were confiscating in the first place. Much less put together an investigation into possible various private keys to various wallets.
@_date: 2019-03-05 04:40:30
So the facts are he's trying to get those who lost BTC the cash value it had at the time of loss. Is anyone else trying to do this that should be supported?
And why are we to believe that you know what he plans to do with the BCH? I need waaay more info that this post gives before I start calling someone a theif. How do we know that he can even get the same amount of BTC that was lost?
@_date: 2019-03-16 19:21:59

I swear BTC if you fuck up this bull run with your stagnant transactions I'm gonna be pissed!

let's see how long 5k btc actually lasts before the "we're heading back to 2k" talks again. I've heard those ever since BTC rose to 4k. It's been 6 months since then, who know maybe this time you'll be the one who was right.

Crypto has such a long way to go. Today's drop is indicative of that it's a scary thought to get paid for something at 1PM with plans of cashing it out at 6Pm and you've lost 10% maybe more in a matter of hours.

Not really dude but you keep scoring points with yours. You gotta be like 16 right?

The amount of money needed to get back to 20k is far greater than 6 cents to 20cents. While crypto is also under much heavier manipulation these days. I see what your saying but it's somewhat misleading.
@_date: 2019-01-01 21:29:43
There is one BTC for every hair on my body let that sink in.
@_date: 2018-02-05 06:59:00
Saying 5k or even 2k and even mentioning back to $200 is complete fud and has no actual logic behind it I might as well say 40k will happen soon because of past trends. Which actually has more of a pattern than your theory.
@_date: 2017-09-20 06:36:38
Money badger! Ha, pretty accurate.
@_date: 2018-02-03 01:04:02
It's always a mix of variables...but I think it's safe to say some serious manipulation pushed the price up to 20k in a matter of days and we'd be fools to assume that it ended there.
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:53:22
I would say it's a blood red cocktail of regulations FUD/overdue correction/whale manipulation/ and just plain old fear.

Well to be fair $1T ain't what it used to be and when you have the world involved in a technological means to trade value without a bank. Truth is there is a use and it will be used until something better is developed.

True crypto enthusiasts would always advise against selling for a loss. No one knows where Bitcoin is heading in the weeks to come but what you can safely assume is that blockchain is going to be used so diversify and hold is the best strategy imo.

TIL HODL is an acronym...even though it's not it is now. Let's embrace it, the more people know this mantra the better. It could really help bring out the philosophy of crypto. There really is something here.
And if you're wondering what the philosophy behind crypto is - it's got something to do with prosperity and sharing that with all sorts of different communities in a technological time.

Hats off to the buyers around 7-8k. Not a bad time to buy it may go lower but it will hit 10k again or I'll eat my dick.

What wallet can safely be linked to my phone? Right now I would probably use Coinbase but I'd like to remove the middle man as you said.

Your mom's vag is a Ponzi scheme.

Suddenly less ass holes saying "I'll see you guys when it hits 2k"
@_date: 2018-04-04 17:53:32
God you sound like a douche. I just thought you should know that. Even if you are 100% right is it worth sounding like a giant douche and or dildo?
@_date: 2018-04-04 18:09:01
This is you: "Hey...HEY! I sold at 19k and now I'm glad it's crashing! Hope that helps."
Keep up the good work Captain America.
