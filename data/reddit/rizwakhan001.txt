I know. Thanks
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:25:32
But I don't feel it will calm down. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:24:51
And how many chances for its crash down to 5000$ back?? 
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:08:04
$8000? Or $8000+ ?? 
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:40:16
Thanks for your motivation. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:29:27
Even I am thinking to sale my bitcoins. I am afraid, it may crash down. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:06:18
In 7 days?  Really? 
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:35:55
I am not asking you. If I am going to invest, I believe I have a right to ask experienced people. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:08:44
Really? I am afraid of this crash! 
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:10:12

@_date: 2017-11-02 15:09:51
Wow! Motivational
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:36:54
I am just afraid. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:06:39
Obviously it will go. I am asking for next 7 days
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:12:35
The more price goes up, the more risky it becomes. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:39:39
I have done all that. Research of anything includes advices from seniors. And that's why I asked experienced people here so that they can give good advice. Thanks

Do you think miners can still earn due to increased difficulty? 
@_date: 2017-10-22 19:38:39

@_date: 2017-10-22 19:40:16
Yes. the electricity is not too expensive. From a bitcoin calculator, i calculated that i can earn 250$ per month from antminer s9, after deducting electricity expenses.
