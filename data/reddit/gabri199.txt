Beyond fees and processing time, there is also another reason that hinders the adoption of any cryptocoin as payment method: the wild fluctuation in value. To be accepted as a method of payment, currencies need to have a stable value. While everybody who owns some bitcoin (or BCH, litecoin, Monero, whatever) is eager to see their value growing fast (or falling fast to buy at the right moment), few would use bitcoin to buy a sofa if they think after a week the same amount would buy a sofa and a bed. Likewise, the vendor would not accept any crypto if he fears the value will erode by the time he has time to cash it (and he wouldn't hire a person just to sit behind a laptop and trade with the shop revenue: hedging of commodities prices was invented exactly to tackle this issue). USD, EUR, YEN, etc. are stable currencies with minimal movements on a daily, weekly and monthly basis. Traders who want to make money on those need to leverage (with options, futures...). When movements are excessive bad things happen (hyperinflation, massive devaluations by central banks..., or the movements are caused by bad things like wars). This is an original sin of all cryptocurrencies, independently from block size, fees, etc: we want them to be the new cash, we treat them as the new gold (or tulips).

That would be nice, but I think if any crypto will become this mainstream, it will have to be with the blessing of governments. I.e. salaries, taxes can only be paid into/from wallets that have been registered with a government agency. So even if you have any rogue wallet, any transaction to/from registered wallets will be tracked. Bitcoin with its memory of every transaction would actually enable perfect tracking.
