By that logic any server that's not in your basement is never secure because someone has physical access to your box.

1. The original developer did not express his objection very well. There were two commits: fixing a typo and rewording the sentence. Instead of saying "This isn't a typo", he should have said "OK I'll take the typo fix but I disagree with rewording the sentence". He failed to communicate that.
2. But then decided to start making fun of his grammar ("it's" vs "its") destroying any chance of cooperation. He failed to deescalate and engage the project maintainer in a civil manner.
Nobody looks good in this.
@_date: 2016-04-16 14:00:43
Oh sure, the maintainer has failed to communicate as well. [I think both parties are guilty.](

@_date: 2016-04-16 13:47:56
There were two commits, one a typo fix, another rewording the sentence, which is pretty subjective.

Yeah, well, that was petty and uncalled for, because of how trivial this error was. I mean I can make that error because of not paying attention or autocorrect, rather than my poor grasp on English. I can definitely see how it can be seen as snarky. It was an objectively poor response.
The worst part you immediately decided to press your point instead of trying to clarify what he meant (even though even now it's clear to me he'd like the typo fix without the sentence structure fix).

Paper loss is a loss. By continuing to hold you incur the opportunity cost of tying up this money in bitcoin and not investing it in other assets.

Nope, early TCP/IP was designed within DARPA, not many stakehodlers there. It hit v4 (the one we have today) even before it became popular. There was also incentive for big corps like IBM to be compatible with whatever DoD says, because DoD declared it a standard.
Have a look at [TCP/IP history on Wikipedia.](

Everything looks fine from my window. All I see is weak hands selling stocks, and very low oil, which will be great for the economy.

Obviously, because it's great for bitcoin.

I think you are overestimating the competence and sophistication of public bitcoin markets. Sharp movements happen all the time and on lower volume, including today.

The difference is, Apple can actually afford to take a "bold stand" because they have TWO HUNDRED FUCKING BILLION DOLLARS IN CASH. They also have a lot at stake: their flagship product worth billions more in revenue. They can drag it out in court for years if they have to.
Good luck taking a stand and taking the bold stand when you have... how much was it... [$450k in seed funding](
@_date: 2016-02-01 11:55:33
Even if it isn't, does this really change the point? If you take all the popular exchanges, I wouldn't expect more than say 10 times the volume (ballpark). $10M, $100M, still tiny.

Aussie R&amp;D "tax subsidy" OP is talking about is actually a tax rebate. You literally get back cash as a percentage of your R&amp;D expenses, if the rebate amount exceeds your tax payable.

More appropriately, S&amp;P 500 went up ~10% in that time, so 9.98% to go. :)
@_date: 2016-05-05 07:17:41
You spend $100 on R&amp;D activities, you get back $50. So now you get to spend $150 in total instead of $100 on your activity. So yeah, it is kind of a hand out.
