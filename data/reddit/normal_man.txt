It just has to be volatile in the right way dammit!

Blockchain allows decentralised, democratised and trustless data. It's has many applications and there may be a use for it with corporations especially for industry wide cooperation. But seeing as data is valuable and corporations own their data I can't see many cases with why they would create a centralised blockchain. If there are, I'd be genuinely interested to read about them.

I could have been luckier, I only bought a fraction of a Bitcoin then forgot about everything until this year. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:02:57
That one got me to buy Bitcoin!

2) I think it's something that hacker Four Chan uses to buy drugs with.

Thank you for alerting me to bitcoin beginners. I'm going to be starting my own web store soon and would love to incorporate bitcoin. So far I've struggled to really understand bitcoin enough to be confident about accepting digital currency.

Thank you.

Hey that's a nice looking feed.

I'm waiting for my funds to clear and watching the price rise and rise and rise!
@_date: 2017-11-25 08:56:13
This is exactly my point! ������

Thanks for the gold! I won't forget you when we hit $100,000 ����

I'd kind of heard about dodgy internet money in before, Antonopoulous convinced me to get some when he was on the Joe Rogan Experience.

I accept it as payment and I'm trying to get my suppliers to let me use it to buy stock!
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:01:09
Man I brought in 2014 and totally forgot about it until 2 months ago. It's been a heck of a ride - I'm definitely going to be buying more!

I want some of that mega-earner privilege! I'd assume though I'd still get a P60 at the end of the year? It's not as though I'm asking for cash in hand or anything, the company would still have to declare me on their books.

Hey man, hope you take this as constructive feedback as it's intended rather than an attack on your work.
You have to know your audience. I'd imagine if my parents read this, they'd still come away not knowing much more. 
1) You detail a lot of features of Bitcoin. IMO what you should do is write more about the benefits of Bitcoin.
Feature = So what? 
Benefit = This is how it makes your life better.
2) I'd probably really minimise or dump the information about nodes and mining. If you're selling a car, you probably wouldn't mention something like the octane levels. Lead the reader to a link to further reading if they choose to go there.
I think your guide is confused as to what it wants to be. A marketing brochure to get the reader interested in Bitcoin or a step by step guide to assist the reader. I think it fails in both.

Man I'd never even heard of Reddit back then! 
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:16:33
Hey man, sorry I've been away. First of all, who are you targeting this at? Once I know, we can work from there.
Just very quickly though, Why Should I Care About Bitcoin does not give me any reason to actually care about Bitcoin.

Trezor and Ledger. Yes.
