Garbis can you please either send me proof Bitfinex have followed up with Citibank or credit my account with the money owed?
We’re talking about ~$29,000 of my money that’s been missing for 5 months. How can you accept that Citibank can keep my money for no reason? 
@_date: 2018-09-03 06:48:03
So can you provide any proof that you are following up with the bank?
I still have not received my money back.
@_date: 2018-09-11 16:50:45
Still waiting for proof.
@_date: 2018-09-25 18:50:36
Still no update 
@_date: 2018-09-06 13:05:46
Just ignoring me now?
@_date: 2018-09-07 10:53:31
Well, can you provide any proof or not?
I’m still waiting for my money back
@_date: 2018-09-07 17:11:32
Ok but how about showing me proof that you have emailed Citibank?
@_date: 2018-09-04 06:26:42
Can you please provide proof that you are in regular contact with the bank to resolve this issue?
Otherwise I cannot believe you.
@_date: 2018-08-27 16:35:47
So who is causing the delay? Citibank? It doesn’t make sense that it would take this long to return funds.
You should just credit my account for amount of money owed.
@_date: 2018-09-04 21:10:48
Monitoring daily but no update in over 5 days? Do you have the proof or not?
Where is my money?
@_date: 2018-08-24 06:36:08
Still waiting...
@_date: 2018-08-25 07:46:58
Still waiting, I just don’t understand why you won’t return my money?
I don’t want to spend $2,000 on legal fees but at this stage what choice do I have.
@_date: 2018-08-23 06:56:58
Thank you. I appreciate you linking their support staff. I just really don’t want to have to spend $2,000 to get my money back!
@_date: 2018-08-23 06:57:24
Thanks. I’m still waiting for a response.
@_date: 2018-08-30 08:05:01
Still no update?
Why can you not credit my account with the money owed?
@_date: 2018-08-25 12:28:31
How can a bank transfer take this long? 
@_date: 2018-08-27 10:01:24
Any update now? 
@_date: 2018-08-26 19:21:45
So when can I expect my money back? I already said that I will start legal proceedings to have the company liquidated if I did not receive it by Friday 24 August. 
I sent that final warning to support on Friday 17 August and received no reply.
Honestly, what choice do I have? If you were in my shoes would you keep waiting?
Monday morning I will be making a wire transfer to pay the lawyers in BVI. I cannot believe I have had to resort to this.
@_date: 2018-08-30 17:03:32
Can you please cc me on these emails or forward them to me?
I’ve seen no proof that you are following up and it’s been over 4 months since I attempted to withdraw my funds.
@_date: 2018-08-30 08:05:48
It’s been a week and you haven’t gotten back to me. What’s going on?
@_date: 2018-08-30 18:19:49
Can you send any proof at all that these emails are being sent? I don’t mind if you have to blur out peoples email addresses or sensitive information.
How else can I believe you are doing anything?
@_date: 2018-08-27 10:02:14
Not going to respond at all? I can see you’ve been online based on your commenting activity.
@_date: 2018-08-25 10:57:49
Paging - can you resolve this issue?
@_date: 2018-10-03 07:21:53
Still no update, just another stalling mechanism.
@_date: 2015-04-21 18:14:05
Example scenario:
I broke my TV. So I get you to rent a room at my place for the night. Then I smash the TV up to look good for the pictures and blame it on you. Yay insurance fraud!
Granted these problems exist for AirBnB to a certain extent.
We would need a system in place to verify people and prevent multiple accounts being made. I know some hosts on AirBnB can request for verification via social network profiles and passport scans
@_date: 2015-04-21 18:50:09
I am all for a decentralised replacement of AirBnB and agree with every point you've made so far.
I think the major hurdle would be getting users on board, I know anybody who likes Bitcoin also likes decentralisation and sees the benefits of it but for the general population having no central authority figure is scary.
@_date: 2015-04-21 14:35:58
There are many issues that AirBnB solve that are difficult to replicate compared to a decentralised solution.
E.g. Hosts are fully insured by AirBnB if anything is stolen or broken.

More people buying than selling
@_date: 2015-09-15 18:44:21
Possibly LocalBitcoins, have two accounts  and both got the email 
@_date: 2015-04-21 17:22:04
All good points, it is just the arbitration is an issue really. And how could you prevent two or more people working together to game the system submitting false claims?
