Make it a non-English word and write it down on a paper. And now tell me what are the chances that a thief hacks your computer and steals that one post-it note you have below your bed.

I am praxxing here, so keep that in mind. I would say that once bitcoin is mined out and people believe that it will keep on rising in value and so they will try to hold the currency, there will come a point where it just won't rise anymore, people will lose faith in the currency and it will sharply go down. Obviously, as long as it has an intrinsic use, e.g. drug trade, it will be still worth something.

How is the inherent deflationary nature of Bitcoin addressed?

Give evidence of fiat scam

I don't have to look up proof if I am challenging you to provide evidence for claim that you are defending.
@_date: 2017-05-13 21:08:02
Thanks for that. I still think that this is not relevant because a lot of national banks enact same or very similar policies together with the fed.

I don't want logic, I want at least a credible source






No? Central banks are independent of government.


It is not obviously true


I don't think that the burden of proof lies with me.
@_date: 2017-05-23 23:09:00
All you do is try to convince me how everyone knows it and I am stupid that I don't know it. It is obvious that you do not have any evidence.

I am going to back off now, I just suggest you ditch heterodox streams in favour of econimic mainstream.
@_date: 2017-05-24 09:06:49
No, you cannot tell me to do work when the burden of proof lies with you.

This is a prax, not evidence

[That is just not true]( Not that the Fed has always done a stellar job but since Paul Volcker, it did extremely well.


That seems unstable. Do you have any literature describing this?


Do you mean tariffs? [They are bad, okay?](


Consider the graph that I posted

No, give me evidence. Austrian economics is trash.

Even going by your link, (a)3B clearly states that profits above a certain number is sent o the treasury.




Private profiteers are not managing your nation's money. The Fed is an independent institution that is protected from both business and political interest. 
@_date: 2017-05-13 20:11:20


It is a quasi-governmental institution, that is true. However, all the important central banks in the world are national institutions, so I don't think it really matters.


Independent central banks result in better outcomes. I might try and find evidence for it. 


What money is paid to the shareholders? All profit made by the US Fed goes to the US treasury.
@_date: 2017-05-13 21:59:07


I wouldn't be surprised if it was just a symbolic tradition. The Federal Reserve Act required member banks to buy shares. So it was actually a government decision.


Because this causes Hyperinflation if the money is spent. Case in point, Weimar republic.


Fear-mongering, not an argument.
