I guess from your comment I interpreted it as there is no point in shorting, as in you don't intend to ever short it. Out of curiosity at what price would you short at?

Sorry I don't follow your logic here, I understand you wanted to get an understanding of peoples mindset, hence why you asked the question. They aggressive and defensive response are expected as you are "undermining" their financial decision. However you clearly have belief that this is a bubble and it will crash. So why not short it? If it is a bubble, it will pop and crash and you will make money, from what you said here it seems like you are saying it is a bubble but because everyone is pumping it it won't crash. Please clarify.

If I want to buy 1 bitcoin at $10,000CAD. The coinsquare format requires you to execute a sell order at 1/10,000 in order to have 1 bitcoin in your account. Confusing, yes, impossible no. That's why I use QuadrigaCX, plus there is no withdrawal fee. The only thing coinsqaure has over quad, IMO, is slightly lower transaction fees.

Looks amazing, will it have support for CAD as well, a site like cbix.ca would a good place to pull data from

I would avoid coinsquare, you have to sell CAD to buy bitcoin and you also have to do everything in terms of $1 CAD/BTC
