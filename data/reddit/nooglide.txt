great review - one point to add here, a reason companies and people would transact with lightning / litecoin / bitcoin instead of cards is *fees*.  this is a huge reason to transact over lightning.
sure it is minimal per transaction, 1.5% doesnt seem like a lot but huuuge aggregate merchant fees.  what is the % a lightning transaction costs for that cup of coffee to the merchant vs a visa merchant fee over a week, a month, a year
if i want to use lightning as a merchant (of any business) i can remove 1.5%-3.5% transaction fees

new to the community and see you and a few others talking about how great bip148 is vs segwit but, why?  
in few days educating on this it reads like UASF/BIP148 creates a fork that kinda goes against what bitcoin was about, or maybe im missing something?
youre saying to share bip148 but wheres my comparisons charts?  whats this do for me the other doesnt? 
"UASF/BIP148 is a new way to implement Segwit." ok so, what makes us need a new way to implement segwit vs just implementing segwit?
isnt segwit what the core devs want?  maybe some recent tweets i read?
again just tell me what is so great about BIP148 on a side by side comparison with just segwit, i dont get it?

Sucks man, had more money stolen from me x2.5 right around 2012, I feel your pain and can only tell you get back on the horse, don't let it get to you - it happened and it's done with. Don't lament too long, move on, shit will get better and many more opportunities starting now

Feel like you're missing the point here, say you love core and Coinbase supports core A. Two other splits happen - B and C and Coinbase doesn't support them.  Bitcoin ends up with 63 million total coins Bitcoin A B and C.  You own one Bitcoin A through Coinbase  but the other ones B and C also find support at $2500 and Coinbase doesn't give you a way to exchange them.  Now you're out $5,000.   And Coinbase owns the Bitcoin B and C and your $5,000.  Doesn't matter if you really supported core A, you're going to be pissed they kept your B and C coins as well, especially if one of them goes to the moon but not your coin A.

Great article, tells me exactly nothing.   put "Bitcoin" in there a few times for some page views

this makes sense, understand.  someone did post a coinbase support person saying they arent guaranteeing supporting any kind of split like they did with eth (though even that was potentially more cautionary then reality)


never said its a problem though, it just is what it is.  an unknown, which was the point of this thread
