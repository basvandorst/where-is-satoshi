Wouldn't be a simple money deposit easier to drawback? Just withdraw the deposit and done, no license things.

How come? How many users use the "real" bitcoin wallet? I think it's not much.
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:18:32
I can make a coin USDX today that is backed by euros, what's your point?
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:13:54


So what was the price?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:24:49
@_date: 2017-02-15 07:49:40
Wow, 3 year club. This checks out.
@_date: 2017-01-30 23:27:08
In theory yes. Practically we know there will be a queue with transactions.
@_date: 2017-08-22 21:49:27
If you sell to bitmain, they have the coins and you have the dollars.
@_date: 2017-08-10 09:50:01
Mining is inflation... the inflation only lowers with the time.
@_date: 2017-08-18 15:12:22
For your typical business expenses, yes nobody accepts it. 
@_date: 2016-11-25 09:18:47
Why do I need to pay a high transaction fee? I can better use a bank then.
Maybe this full mempool sounds logical to techies. For the average Joe it's just another reason why banks are better than bitcoin. A high selling point of btc was "send money around the world in 10 minutes". Nope, 30+ hours.
@_date: 2016-11-25 09:33:14
And then start a discussion of whether they set a too high transaction fee, who's going to pay for that or setting a too low one and will never confirm in time.
Even then, they use bitpay, they don't even have your btc.

If my light only works 30 hours after I turned it on and the electrician says it's expected behaviour and it's ok it doesn't matter if I understand it or not to think it's a shitty light.
@_date: 2016-11-25 09:22:38
Which is logical, otherwise they would be a btc &gt; dollar exchange without fees.
@_date: 2018-06-16 13:54:15
Maybe we are on 7 but 7 is way more to the left on the bottom chart.

As soon as AWS starts to mess with server's operations the world has bigger problems than some centralized nodes. They would *never* do that. And as long as not a large part of all nodes is running on AWS the attack vector is very small.
@_date: 2015-08-13 16:08:51
That's my supermarket! Fuck...
@_date: 2019-06-08 09:24:09
Yes, it's basically AWS with a simpler UI.
@_date: 2018-02-21 11:04:18
Because you can't loan bitcoin and so no one has debt!!!! /s
@_date: 2019-01-23 20:20:29
I'm an it guy and I even trust banks to store it better them myself. Especially when it's insured. Banks do weird shit but storing things unsafe is not one of them.
@_date: 2019-01-25 08:58:02
Yes but who cares. There will only ever be 100 million * 21 million satoshis.
@_date: 2018-03-18 18:14:56
It's almost as this market is based on demand.
@_date: 2019-01-23 20:17:56
For many people banks are safer than storing it themselves. It's fine as long as you have the choice.
@_date: 2018-02-21 10:47:55
But it also means that the price was inflated. So one side it goes up, one side down. So it may stay the same *if* this blows up.
@_date: 2018-02-03 14:27:25
If bitcoins were 300 usd last november, then yes. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 10:43:14
My girlfriend has an ING account. Should I dump her? Maybe she'll cheat on me.
@_date: 2018-02-10 16:49:05
Except it was Rabo USA that did this.
@_date: 2017-10-22 16:08:00
A solid stable $0.0001 price.
@_date: 2018-02-20 15:09:42
Gotta pay a larger fee to keep your arteries open.
@_date: 2018-04-03 11:13:19
Ofc it isn't dead. But what did you expect? That it went from 1 to 20k in one year without any kind of crash? It'll come back within a few months to several years.
@_date: 2017-05-25 19:09:07
Killing yourself is free.
@_date: 2016-05-16 06:53:17
@_date: 2015-11-23 22:53:30
It you're that easy to track when you don't want to, you're not hiding your coins good enough.
@_date: 2017-05-26 18:14:10
You get 20k from helping your grandmother all day?
@_date: 2017-05-26 17:56:36
I want it to crash, can steal some cheap coins of some sellers then.
@_date: 2017-05-25 20:48:21
Which raises the question, are you "buying" or "selling" someone's suicide?  
@_date: 2017-05-25 20:56:12
We just have to accept that then
@_date: 2017-05-26 18:12:28
@_date: 2019-05-29 21:06:36
Can anyone explain what's so special about this? I thought we already had a working LN on mainnet.
@_date: 2019-05-29 21:16:02
So with this channel we can now do 1 BTC LN transactions?
