Personally, I'd mine solo. You get more coins per block going solo (especially with your rig). I mine at about 80 MHash/s and it took 2 weeks of on and off mining to get my first block.
As for the miner, I use [rpcminer]( with -aggression=10. rpcminer seems to be faster than poclbm (at least on my GTX 460) by about 5-15 Mhash/s

Yeah I'm aware of that, but it doesn't add to the readers count which makes me feel bad for not supporting the subreddits.

I read regularly, although it's not on my frontpage. I *really* wish reddit would add the ability to have multiple feeds so that I don't have to clutter my frontpage with low-activity subreddits.

I don't know, but it went back up.

[BTCDeals]( had a 48-hour HIB sale at the start of the bundle, which is how I paid for mine.

Dunno, personally I'd say we're down more.

I don't think you understand what that graph is showing. The blue line is the amount of coins needed to be traded at a higher value for the value of bitcoins to go up. The yellow line is the amount of coins needed to be traded at a lower value for the value of bitcoins to go down.

It's back up to $10 today.

I can no longer buy reddit gold with the coins I received from bitcointip. :(

Why would anyone pay for porn, let alone the "professional" crap that these sites shovel out.
