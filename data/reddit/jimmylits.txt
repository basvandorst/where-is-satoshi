|If it just takes a few posts on Reddit to change what bitcoin is, it's pretty scary. Agree ! Many bitcoiners have no access to Reddit or not even heard of it.

Tens of thousands of bitcoiners are not aware of this voting/consensus website. How this can be proven as consensus ?

You are perfectly right about it ! I don't believe that many individual users who run a full node from time to time could uptake the HF within a short period of time.

Bitcoin is not expensive at all or simply too cheap when transferring money across borders / currencies. It's not shitty if you are smart enough not to pay a cup of coffee by bitcoin.

Bitcoin even with a perfect Lightning will not compete with Visa until year 2026 best optimistically. And don't forget other cost-free payment or micropayment systems actually are used nowadays.

Absolutely right !

Medium of exchange may not necessarily mean or include micropayment. Lightning or any yet known killer apps could do it. And I remind you that gold is money too.

When talking about the 3rd world's adoption, honestly you won't see it before 2020. I am living in the 3rd world now telling you that.
