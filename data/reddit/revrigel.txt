Modern gold ore grades are low enough (a few grams per metric ton) that it most assuredly is rock when you dig it up.

It just means people only invest their deflationary capital in ventures that have a risk-adjusted rate of return higher than the rate of deflation. If Bitcoin is increasing in value due to deflation at 2% per year, and you can buy shares of blue chip stock that will return 8%, or you need to buy a car so you can drive to work and get paid, you'll be willing to part with the Bitcoin.

Nah, the cryptocurrency Steorn pays their employees in has a proof of work performed by the revolutionary new zero point quantum computer they have in a hermetically sealed black box, and it's 100% pre-mined.

Just to clarify: Bitcoins are not a viable emergency contraceptive drug.

Well, the qualitative difference between US dollars and Bitcoins is that the quantity of USD can be increased without bound, and Bitcoins will never exceed 21 million. From a scarcity standpoint, that makes it slightly better than gold, which has no effective limit on its ultimate quantity even if it takes a lot of effort to mine. If we were on a gold standard thousands of years from now, and gold was extremely valuable, you would see people using heavy ion colliders to de novo synthesize gold, but there would still be &lt;= 21 million Bitcoins.

Fuel to run machinery and vehicles is the primary input cost for gold mining.  Pretty easy to see that when gold was a lot cheaper, so was oil.

Well, if I wanted to get a good look at the rate of growth in BTC price over the entire graph, not just the dominant spike at the end, a log graph would be better. It depends on whether the goal is to communicate the entirety of the price action depicted in the graph, or to shock and awe with the parabolic rise on the right. I own no bitcoins and while I won't call it a bubble I do think the market action in BTC is overextended, so I have no interest in it continuing upward without stopping. But when I look at a graph I seek to be informed,  not to be punched in the head by a really impressive hockey stick shape.

Well, not entirely true. There was a period when the Spanish treasure ships were bringing so much gold and silver back from the new world that inflation got pretty out of control. I'm looking at page 82 of 'The Great Wave' by David Hackett Fisher, and the graph shows Spanish commodity prices increasing 10-fold between 1500 and 1660 due to treasure imports.
Something similar could still happen to gold if asteroid mining became easy to do.

That sort of data should really be presented with a log y-axis.

The other advantage to gold and silver eagles is that if someone counterfeits them, they're counterfeiting US legal tender coins. They'll have to answer to the Secret Service. If someone makes a gold-plated tungsten Krugerrand, you'll have to convince the FBI to give a shit somehow.

That will be mitigated if Bitcoin ever becomes widespread enough that wholesale settlement with suppliers can be conducted in Bitcoin as well.

Well, precious/platinum group metals are different from rare earth metals. Rare earths are elements like neodymium, samarium, praeseodymium, gadolinium, etc. Get used a lot in high performance permanent magnets, so they're in demand for electric cars. They're actually not that rare in terms of presence in the Earth's crust, it's just that their prices were so low for a long time and most of the mines except for a few in China shut down. Now that the prices are higher, we're in a time period where prices are high but mines in California and elsewhere aren't quite online with additional supply yet. I'm also not sure asteroids will have a ton of rare earth metals, but they are reputed to have a lot of platinum group metals.

Well, the London Gold Pool collapsed in 1968. After that Nixon closed the gold window in 1971 and turned USD into completely unbacked fiat. You would see very little movement in the dollar price of gold in the decades prior to 1968 except for the step revaluation from 20.66/toz to 35/toz during FDR's administration.

Definitely. But it's something to think about as a goal. Everyone is very focused on getting retail support for bitcoin right now, but one way to make it easier on retailers is to simultaneously promote B2B use of bitcoin. It would be trivial to support large monthly payments for wholesale goods with the current architecture (relative to the difficulties of a hundred million people spending a bitcent on coffee every morning), and would encourage retailers to keep bitcoins received in bitcoin and not immediately convert to fiat.

In entrepreneurial circles this is known as the '1% of China' fallacy, wherein a pitching investor will say 'China is an eleventy billion dollar market. If we can just capture 1% of that..' with no concrete plan for how that will ever happen.

What you're seeing in action is Gresham's Law. The bad money drives out the good. When fiat currency is given status as legal tender, and must be accepted in payment for debt, why would anyone try to settle debts in a harder or less inflationary currency? I own some precious metals. Do you see me handing them over when people are willing to accept paper instead? No. If paper did not have the weight of legal tender laws behind it, sellers would be at liberty to demand payment in whatever form they wanted, be it USD, gold, silver, or Bitcoin.
There were plenty of times on the gold standard that prices were stable or deflationary and the economy continued without collapsing. Obviously Bitcoin isn't at a stable -1 or -2% inflation yet, but in a few more years when we're further up the mining curve, and the valuation is less volatile, people will be more willing to spend it.
This is the reason Bitcoin is flourishing for businesses for whom legal tender laws do not matter, i.e. those that exist outside the law already. Gambling, Silk Road, etc. They can demand whatever payment they like.

Yeah, I'm not saying it can't/won't happen. It just may be a lot longer slog than people here think. The market can take forever to reflect things that some people are convinced are inevitable. There were/are a lot of precious metals investors convinced that maintaining huge naked shorts of silver and gold contracts would blow up in the face of JP Morgan and HSBC and silver and gold would go to $450 and $7500 respectively and be remonetized with much dancing in the streets. That thesis has been active for at least 5 years, longer than bitcoin has been around, and it could still happen. I'm in favor of both the metals and bitcoin, but Mr. Market is always going to make you work for it and gut check you every chance he gets.
