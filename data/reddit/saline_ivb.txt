There is no such thing. Cash is exchanged for bitcoins, bitcoins for cash at whatever exchange rate the parties agree to, but nothing is stored anywhere at any point.

Because the number of bitcoins you can sell at the current market price is much much smaller than the total number. Example: If you tried selling, say, 20% of all the bitcoins in circulation at once, the price would crash to single digits right away.

New bagholders are always needed, that's how pyramid schemes work. OP's winnings come from the pockets of ten marks like you.

I'm sure you're right about Tether, I'm just saying that the concept of "cash moving into bitcoin" is misleading.

The paper wallet filling transaction was stolen by a clipboard hijacking Trojan. The hardware wallet was physically stolen.

Then you discover your cold storage has been emptied years ago by one of the countless bitcoin stealing Trojans.

You do realize that the market cap is not "the value of bitcoin", right? That it's an artificial measure that has very little to do with money exchanging hands?

You sound like a total cultist. Really.

No, and this is the important difference. Stocks have a pretty hard above-zero price floor because the raw net assets of the company are worth something, in addition to the expected profit from its business. Bitcoin has nothing like this.

You sound like a cultist demanding loyalty oaths. Sorry.
@_date: 2017-11-18 20:42:50
Of course you do, that's what echo chambers are for.

The next time a core dev accidentally commits a bug I'm looking forward to you demanding they issue a public apology too.

That's how zero sum games work after all, in the end everyone becomes a billionaire.

No, every single penny that you get for selling bitcoins comes from a person buying bitcoins.
