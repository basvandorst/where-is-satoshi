It seems like it never went through :(

Thanks ! Stay tuned for a massive update at the end of next week :)

Hi, I am the creator of 
I am trying to provide such figure : have a look at the *average* mode.
Let me know if you find it useful !
@_date: 2014-04-17 12:27:04
Yeap, this is related to their new Local Trader feature. That can be disabled in the settings section.

Let me know if you have any comments !

Thanks ! Have a nice day :)
@_date: 2014-03-18 17:07:17
Of course it helps ! It would be even more helpful if you could be more specific, for example : is it the windowed interface that you don't like ? is the font size too small ? are there any important info missing ? etc.
Cheers :)

I just received an email from the operator and a full BTC refund. Turns out I haven't been scammed :-)


Should I delete this post ?

Let me know if you have any comments !

Updated  a few hours ago.
No more MtGox, added Kraken instead.

I released a few projects under GPLv2 a couple of years ago, I am familiar with it.
But, GPLv3 seems relevant as well, I'll look at it asap.

Very nice, I guess that's the tool you mentioned last week on bitcointalk :)
ps: a similar tool was added to Coinorama.net last week

I use BTC quite often for shopping online and in local shops ; this is my first bad experience.

Hey, did you also make 6e5c18f1dcfd8041e62a288eb3cd232dafac3c7323182f38f7fbcdd94f5d0b47 ?

@_date: 2014-04-02 14:12:23
Indeed, lots of things to do !
Which graph drawing lib are you using ?
The graph being directed, I think a layered display (like yours) is better.
A while ago, I wrote a directed graph visualization tool  ; maybe I'll switch to these algorithms for Coinorama.

There is also a clarification regarding VAT :

Ah sorry. Maybe a mixup with my understanding of the notation.
I read USD/BTC as "USD per BTC", i.e. the USD price of one BTC.
@_date: 2014-03-20 09:35:44
Hey, nice work :)
In the requirements, you mention "150+GB disk space" ; could you break down this volume according to the various DB you rely on ?
For Coinorama ( I currently use 60 GB (20 GB bitcoind, 40 GB Postgresql).
Cheers !

Network hash rate is an estimation based on the delay between recent blocks, in other words it cannot be measured accurately.
According to the number of blocks used to perform the estimate, results may vary.
For other estimates, have a look at  or

Nice move for both Showroomprive and Paymium, bravo !

No more MtGox, added Kraken instead.

Hey, would you mind sharing the address ?
@_date: 2014-03-18 17:03:22
Hey, thanks for the feedback. I fixed dialog dragging.
@_date: 2014-03-18 17:04:07
Hi, I fixed the leading/trailing whitespace issue. Thanks for testing :)
@_date: 2014-07-18 17:07:21
Not sure if related, but I encountered a problem with OKCoin on Coinorama.net today.
I used to pull data from okcoin.com and started receiving 301 status about 10 hours ago.
The problem was fixed by switching to okcoin.cn
@_date: 2014-03-18 22:17:16
Do small dialogs (such as About, or help/settings in other sections) lag too ?
The blockchain was imported into Postgresql using Python and RPC calls to bitcoind. Not the most efficient way to proceed, but pretty straightforward and simple to implement for a first try.

Thanks for this interesting write-up :)

Thanks !
Feature suggestion : generation of graphviz (or Kroket) files so that the user can explore a large graph on his desktop.
@_date: 2014-07-18 18:45:22
Have you tried using okcoin.cn instead of okcoin.com ?

FYI, the whole story is on bitcointalk :
As far as I know, the conference was delayed for another reason (lack of attendence).

For more than a year now, I have been working on something like that on my spare time ; the web interface is here : 
If you can wait a few weeks, you'll find the source code on GitHub :)

Thanks for your thorough reply ! 
Now looking forward to your launch, ready for enabling Gemini charts on [Coinorama]( :-)
@_date: 2015-08-13 21:40:52
Hi Cameron, Gemini's market data API [1] seems to suggest that trading has already started, can you confirm ?

Btw, some amounts look strange, I think you're doing floats where you should have been doing decimals.
@_date: 2015-04-21 12:31:30
As far as I know, lots of work has happened since (and is happening) on developing a solid unit-testing suite that can be used to validate implementations.
I think it's fair to add that the bitcoin protocol is gradually being externalized from the core implementation, there's no dirty little secret there.
@_date: 2015-04-22 20:37:40
Indeed, blocks are currently moving from [version 2 to 3](
You may visualize the transition on  ; select the block version chart. Currently, less than half of the last 100 blocks were using version 3.
@_date: 2015-04-21 11:31:23
Hey, could you please elaborate on that and maybe list some of the /bugs/ that are shared across implementations ?
@_date: 2015-09-10 18:02:13
And some others :  :-)
@_date: 2013-06-15 13:46:29
Sweet :)

As usual from this website, sensational and unreliable news ...

The Life on Bitcoin team came up with a nice flyer : 
Maybe you can re-use it and/or take some advice from them ?

Yes, I think Kraken is still in beta. The data API works well though :)

So they have nothing woking yet... Bitcoin eco-system is still a few years ahead, no reason to panic....

it's not a bug, it's a feature
just like a cash transaction, sender gets some change back

Yeap, I think it's definitely the BitPay-side that's relevant in this news.
BFL probably allowed the disclosure in order to show that they (still) have "big" customers, despite their apparent PR and delivery problems ; but that's just a side-effect

What about SecondMarket BIT announcement ?

The current gap between Mt Gox (112 $/BTC) and other exchanges (~107 $/BTC) gives credits to hypothesis 1.

could you provide your estimation of a timeframe ?
