Don’t talk others into investing. Especially family. Even it’s Mum.
On top of that, if they are not Bitcoin-literate enough to spot FUDers, they will soon become FUDers. No disrespect to your family.

First time seeing an Apple Watch case. Didn’t know there was a market for it.

OP resides in Australia, runs a small mining operation, but is not aware of any australian exchanges? I find this hard to believe.

I have a trezor, it supports both Litecoin and Bitcoin. I have never used a Ledger nano s. I can’t say if it’s better or not. I chose Trezor because bitcoin.org says it offers complete transparency (open-source). What I like about my Trezor so far is you can customise the home screen image. I am using a photo of me and my wife. You may like this.

I bought directly from Trezor and got it four days later. From Czech to Australia.

It depends on what you wish to do with your Bitcoin. If you bought at 15k and looking to sell at 17.5k or whatever you may want to leave it on the exchange. If you want to Hodl then transfer them to a wallet.

Given that you did not even use the term ‘shorting’ in your post, I would say it is probably not the best idea for you to do so.

Then why are you trying to convince her? She is rich and smart, you are rich. You two have a great relationship. Enjoy life.

How do I use the remind me bot?
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:42:49
I am not sure about that to be honest

We talking about arbitrage? I don’t think $800,000 is enough to make $10,000.

Thank you OP. I hope you can donate generously to ALS research institutes in memory of Hal Finney. I cannot recommend any as I do not reside in the U.S..

ADA has been doing well over the last 48 hours. But I would say most altcoins follow bitcoins price pattern.
Read the reddit post ‘I turned 36000 into 136000’ and decide whether to invest in altcoins.

It’s below 17k now.

OP, can you post the link to the video please? I’d like to hear more. He talked about the less-than-ideal-but-still-better-than-the-one-we-have Gini ratio of bitcoin in one of his videos, maybe he thinks “Satoshi” might want to do something similar with their holding?

Thank you. UBI is a long shot. It would be cool to see it implemented somewhere one day though.

Independent Reserve is another good choice. They process AUD deposit faster than BTCMarkets in my experience. 
Buy on exchanges, store elsewhere (hardware wallet if you are serious about crypto).
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:44:11
On a hardware wallet. Before than I used the official wallet from bitcoin.org.
You should read extensively before buying.

Almost all exchanges forbid withdraw until verification is complete. Most also do not allow deposit prior to verification. I understand bitcoin transactions sometimes need to happen in a timely manner, but rushing into it is definitely not recommended. I wish op good luck in resolving this matter. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 07:20:24
last hundred or so transactions on independent reserve were between AU$9150-9300, which is below market average ~US$7350(~AU$9550). i am curious

‘1.5.  the “Contract Period” starts on October 5, 2017, and ends at 11:59:59 pm UTC on December 31, 2017;
1.6.   “Contract Settlement” means the earlier of 11:59:59 pm UTC on December 31, 2017, or immediately following a Chain Split Event, as defined in these T+Cs;’
You need it to happen soon.

I am interested in knowing if any verified users have had their accounts locked.

A now 1 year old baby needs and will use bitcoin more than you in both of your lifetimes.

You are welcome. I am not being sarcastic at all. You really should do your own research. And reddit is not the place.
I hope by downvoting me you understand things better. 
@_date: 2018-04-10 01:19:17
Do your own research.
