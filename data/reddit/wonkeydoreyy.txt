Account closures being lower on circle is generally an affect of them having fewer users. You'll find threads about that happening with them, too.

I'm not sure how this is relevant to what I said.
@_date: 2015-06-09 00:33:35
You guys should have a public debate.

Not sure how what I said is only thinking in dollar terms. It's talking in terms of absolute gain.
@_date: 2015-06-09 00:32:46
That's because the 1MBers constantly have to explain themselves, because the justifications don't add up to being in Bitcoin's best interest.

OP himself said he has full control of his coins...
@_date: 2015-06-02 08:12:53
It's in the news because the DPR thing *just* happened. It will pass.
Also, bitcoin doesn't feed drug addictions, people feed drug addictions. Making drugs more difficult to acquire doesn't make them safer, it makes them *more* harmful.
@_date: 2015-06-10 02:44:51
Not absolutely positive, but I think forks of all things generally have a common past and diverging futures. I would imagine existing coins are safe, just be careful how you move them after the split.
@_date: 2015-06-08 18:14:59
You realize that if the price remains low, it's because bitcoin will be stagnating, and essentially saying that you hope to invest in a stagnating asset?
It's better to have 1% of something that's growing than 10% of something flat. What matters is not the amount you acquire in terms of bitcoin, it's how much you acquire in terms of dollars and by what % it increases afterward.

"Track"? like, every site "tracks" you. I don't spend bitcoin on illicit things and if I ever felt the need tumbling is easy enough. The coinbase multisig vault actually provides the best combination of security and redundancy of anything I've found out there.
@_date: 2015-06-15 17:42:41
It doesn't matter in the eyes of regulators.
@_date: 2015-06-01 09:04:20
The answer is to wait for a fricking response from coinbase instead of running to reddit with your issues.

Did they actually help you recover your "losses"? If so I consider that pretty impressive, most companies would say "sorry bud, try again."

Multisig vault on coinbase is also really good.

Before somebody says "but scrypt is easy too", it's something like 500 rounds which makes brute forcing extremely impractical. Also, using a salt means any crackers would have to be targeting you specifically.
As a testament to this algorithm's strength they have a 20 BTC bounty on a warp wallet secured with *only 8 characters*. So far nobody has gotten it.
@_date: 2015-05-20 06:15:20
Supply is exceeding demand.
Don't forget that 7,200 BTC are created and dumped into the supply every day. That's $1.6 million that needs to be bought or hoarded every day just to maintain the current price.
Speculation has gotten us this far. The next price movements are waiting for more practical use cases and that has been slow coming.

You're stating as fact things that you don't know to be factual. Namely, that OKCoin is not insolvent. Which most people weren't really thinking about anyway so you didn't need to include a comment about it.

I don't mean to sound pessimistic but not enough people care about bitcoin yet for that change to result in any kind of effective press.
IMO, (probably an unpopular one), if blocks have to have a delay we may as well keep it an an interval that doesn't try to fake instant-ness. 10 minutes kind of stands in your face and makes us search for an *actual* solution to speed and scale, like the lightning network, which I think is a good thing.
@_date: 2015-05-21 19:10:36
Statistics give us information about general trends, they aren't many to say anything about you specifically. 
@_date: 2015-05-16 04:52:55


Because they are a state and they have that power?
Ultimately bitcoin would benefit from being recognized as money instead of property. It's infeasible at scale to operate it in a currency-like fashion if any gains on it are taxed as income tax. So it seems we should be petitioning at all levels to get it recognized as money, instead of preventing things that basically start framing it that way.
@_date: 2015-05-15 22:16:21
So it seems like the main point should be to petition them to change their definition of bitcoin to money, but that isn't mentioned in the petition at all, so it seems weak/ineffective.

I wasn't talking about that. Somebody said "just another reason for blockchain technology!" or something like that and it didn't make sense so I asked "why?" but they deleted their post.

Not by definition, this is silly
@_date: 2015-08-05 18:55:54
If they vanish, you control the keys so you still have your own money. They even provide an open source recovery tool that you can find on github.
They do not require identifying information to use the multisig vault, so that should not be a real fear.
It is a good product. You may recommend not using it, but that's more a result of following the anti-coinbase religion than applying rationality.

Augur should take 10 minutes to create an app called "Augur News", which is dead simple: just a list of recent predictions and their likeliness of happening. I feel like it would be really awesome to be able to open an app and get a list of future world events. Maybe "Predicted News" or "Future News", something like that. Imagine reading the news before it happened.

I don't have any particluar affinity for the Winklevoss twins, but you have to understand that there is _**literally nothing they can do**_ until they've gotten the green lights they're waiting for from regulators.
Their product is probably primed and ready to go. But the launch date is not something they control.
@_date: 2015-07-01 05:48:00
This is perfect. 
@_date: 2015-07-07 17:13:25
Miners could do that already by accepting no-fee transactions, it doesn't require a spam attack like this. And yet none do.
@_date: 2015-07-29 06:12:08
This isn't the first halvening. Look back to look forward.
@_date: 2015-07-07 09:44:34
The attack is futile if the limit and fees are high enough such that they couldn't sustain that kind of attack. So this FUD would not actually occur.
@_date: 2015-07-24 19:00:17
They probably started with a different method and have given up on it after seeing how slowly it is progressing. Then they watched itBit, who are nobodies, get a "charter" and murkly (in a legal sense) open to the whole US. But at least that's still opening, so they said WTF and just applied for the same thing. My guess, anyway.
@_date: 2015-07-13 08:27:52
Correlation is not causation. Nothing says the "whole rally was centered around grexit."

Sounds to me like an argument for removing the blocksize limit.
@_date: 2015-07-31 18:16:54
No, their exchange is available in these places as well. Except in the US it's about 30 states, not all of them. The regular wallet doesn't require any verification so the whole map would be green.
@_date: 2015-07-07 06:42:16
Somebody's really trying hard to prove something about about the blocksize debate. Unfortunately it's impossible to tell whether they want the limit kept and are trying to emphasize the importance of sidechains (dumb...) or are arguing for the limit to be increased/removed. It's not much of a point if we can't discern what it is.
@_date: 2015-08-14 07:46:11
People will recommend all sorts of things, and they are all good options. But likely, you will eventually end up on Coinbase or similar, because they provide buy/sell functionality and also have multisig wallets. May as well jump right to it.

I will pay 1 btc for a self-hosted version that is open-sourced on github. This is awesome!
@_date: 2015-07-21 07:43:10
If it's open source and decentralized can't you put anything you want on it?
@_date: 2015-07-28 07:17:40
Why would the price double? Halving decreases new bitcoin produced, but it doesn't halve the amount of bitcoin already on the market. The vast majority of traded bitcoin is bitcoin that already exists.
@_date: 2015-07-07 17:15:42
Exactly - nobody is saying they shouldn't work on those things. Those things are great! But blockstream &amp; co have this really strong desire to sacrifice bitcoin to do it. Why? If new technologies valuable, they will provide value alongside bitcoin, they don't need to replace it.
But they're so goddamn vehement about claiming that bitcoin needs to be cut down, that it's clear they're resorting to childish maneuvers to attempt to prove it.
@_date: 2015-07-07 06:38:29
This site is great. For the Coinbase link, you should generate a referal code and use that. That way when people sign up and connect a bank, you get a small referral bonus!

Can you elaborate? I'm not sure what you're trying to say. NY explicitly didn't want these businesses, and now they're leaving.

"Regulate its value"? Huh?
@_date: 2015-07-07 09:43:34


Huh? It seems way more like somebody trying to prove a point about bitcoin needing to be a "settlement ledger" instead of a currency, because the blockchain as it is can't handle transactions, justifying blockstream/sidechains.
@_date: 2015-07-16 20:29:13
I think it would work well as a standalone app instead of a side feature. But still cool.
@_date: 2015-07-02 09:15:03
This is why it saddens me that this was released. As interesting as it is to hear about, it would have been much more satisfying for the culprit to be apprehended. Now that it's basically public knowledge that they're trying to bait him, the chances of it actually happening are basically nil, and the chance for justice has been destroyed.
The leaker of this doc basically ensured that bitstamp will never get its money back.
@_date: 2015-07-07 17:24:14
Miners can currently do exactly what you said - flood the network - by accepting 0 fee transactions. And yet they do not.
Seems like they'd need to be a pretty big pool to be able to do that reliably/consistently and any node/pool that did would just be dropped by its peers. And you can't just spin up another pool that suddenly has such a high % of hash volume. And what mining pool is going to sacrifice all its future revenue for that kind of silly attack? They are financially incentivized to not do it.
Doesn't seem that difficult to solve, since it'd solve itself.
@_date: 2015-07-07 20:30:49
So just increase the size 10x. Somebody could spam but it's still manageable, and they'd eventually burn out. If they didn't, then fees could increase until they did.
We are reaching the point where 1MB blocks are not enough for regular well-intentioned users to conduct business. Sure, new sidechain technologies could help, but (1) they don't exist yet, and (2) the potential for them to exist doesn't mean bitcoin itself should not attempt to handle its own scaling.
@_date: 2015-07-13 09:25:05
I'm not saying it's not a factor, but believe it or not, bitcoin is growing with or without Greece.
Also, context. This is hardly a "crash". The price is currently at $283 and we were at $270 barely 3 days ago. Meaning that if this is all the effect that "grexit" is having, then you can observe for yourself that it's practically nil, because the price is still up.
@_date: 2015-07-02 07:24:00
I hate to piss on the birthday cake here, but this is actually probably what Lawsky wants.
In a large part the license was a reaction to things like Gox and various thefts throughout time. They were very concerned about this happening again, and definitely did not want it to come from New York, a global financial hub.
The law is intentionally designed to remove these smaller, riskier players from the state. Obviously, we being bitcoin fans point to these companies and say "NY is losing business!" But they look at it and say "Thank god, the risky businesses that we want to leave are leaving."
So yeah it stinks, but it's also not proving anything except that NY can get what it wants. There's no point in closing in NY just to try to make a statement.

You talk to them like they can just do whatever they want and have infinite resources.
Not even Coinbase can just walk up to banks and say "Hey! Wanna bank us?" And have that happen. Bitcoin is seen as incredibly risky - the banks they already have may seem super conservative, but are actually about as forward-thinking as a bank can possibly be in the US, strictly by virtue of the fact that they're backing a bitcoin company at all.
On top of that they can't fight your battle for you. It's a competitive market and they probably properly recognize that they should be working on building their product, and not martyring themselves for merchants that don't make a difference to their bottom line.
I think you have plenty to be disappointed in, but I think the blame is improperly placed on the bitcoin company (any of them), when it should be on the regulation that they're forced to abide by.
