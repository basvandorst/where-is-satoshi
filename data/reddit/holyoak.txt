I don't think Satoshi wants to be found, and i hope he gets his wish.  Such a little thing to ask of others, but almost impossible for us to give.
I think Satoshi is a very intelligent entity.  A trail of red herrings would not surprise me, and i think that is what Newsweak has uncovered.
However, i am concerned.  How does one begin to concoct a cover story or co-opt another person's details as a cover?  Many more clues are about to tumble out, which is a shame.   At least Dorian S. Nakamoto seems an ideal candidate for telling the press to fuck off.

Thanks for posting the most interesting question of the week, and getting out and looking for solutions!
The only answer, as some have already noted, is some sort of hedge.  The best way from an economic perspective is to hedge it yourselves.
1.  The first move is to force the choice onto the customer beforehand; this is entirely reasonable and will help clear up any confusion by either party.  Only customers who pay in BTC will have the option to 'check the box' that says "In the event of a return, i want my refund in BTC", or "I want my refund in USD".
2.  Next, we have to get a hard estimate on the number of asshats who will try to abuse the system, let's say 10%.  Now you just have to hold onto 10% of the BTC AR that have checked "BTC refund" in order to pay off the asshats.  Remember, you only have to pay off the asshats if the price of BTC rises significantly before the return deadline, so any BTC funds over-reserved have gained value: this added value can then be ploughed back into your hedge fund to further reduce your risk.  With good accounting and some moderate price increase you should have a self sufficient hedge in 6 months or less.
Assuming your company is looking to book profit in dollars, the trick is to nab enough extra dollars from appreciation to offset the cost basis of the whole BTC slush fund as quickly as possible; then you just don't realize the gain in perpetuity.  Once this goal is reached, even if BTC falls in price (all the way to zero), from your accounting perspective it doesn't matter.
Good luck!

These are good questions, glad you asked them.  I wouldn't buy into something i didn't understand and trust either.  The first answer is relatively simple, so i will focus on the second.
Scenario  which i nickname the 'coin killer' scenario, is one of the more likely outcomes. But let's look at the process of how this scenario would need to play out before passing judgement.
1. Bitcoin would have to be a credible threat; i would estimate that adoption and market cap would need to expand another 10 fold before the threat is 'credible', if not more.  As you pointed out, the size of the BTC pool is only a drop in the larger bucket.  So if you are an early adopter, this is a problem of luxury, albeit at the risk of the larger goal.
2. BTC are truly infinitely divisible; only the current code limits the current divisibility to 8 places.  Changing this would be trivial, as the potential need has been anticipated.  Therefore in the case of 'killed coins' the whole network could continue to run on one satoshi if necessary.  It would be very hard, if not impossible, to stamp out the last few hodlers. But...
3.  Let's assume the worst.  We are down to relatively few hodlers who are demanding an unreasonable price.  Now it turns into a witch hunt.  Such a campaign would need to be accompanied by a massive marketing push in order to 'criminalize' the practice of using BTC.   IMO this plays out about the same as it has with alcohol, weed, guns, porn, etc...  Essentially it becomes a massive marketing push **in favor** of BTC.  But...
4. Let's still play worst case scenario and assume that the 'coin killers' win both the market battle for the coins and and the marketing battle for the 'hearts  and minds'.  This can only happen after  (a massive influx of capital to hodlers) and  (a massive marketing push resulting in widespread knowledge of the tech).  So now we just start over on Bitcoin2.0, except with more capital and more adopters.  This is perhaps the optimal scenario, as lesson learned in the first go round will be corrected and the Gini coefficient would most likely be healthier on the second try.
Some things i didn't see in your post:
If you are worried about threats to the bitcoin ecosystem, the most likely culprits would be XRP, NXT, or some variant of this theme.   All of the functionality; none of the freedom.  The only way to defeat these chimeras is to outperform them;  your adoption (especially as a merchant) is a vote for one over the other.
A threat you haven't mentioned is the outright ban of bitcoin by the government.  This gets increasingly unlikely as regulations and guidelines are drafted and implemented.  Bans in Ecuador and Russia will create differential pressure and arbitrage opportunities; i predict they will fail as outlined in   Even an outright worldwide ban would be more likely than not to fail for these same reasons.
Another threat you have not mentioned is cracking the SHA-256 encryption.  SHA-1 has already been cracked.  The reality is that if SHA-256 gets cracked, there are going to be a lot bigger problems than bitcoin;  your wallet would not be on the list of the 1,000,000 most valuable items to hack.  Also, in this scenario getting bitcoins into a different algo coin is going to be a lot quicker and easier than trying to recover and convert fiat.
Another likely threat is Gox2.0.  There are traders in that believe this is already happening.  While this could crash the market again, it would not kill the network.  The simple answer to this is if you don't have the keys, you don't have the coins.  Speculators will be burned the most.
The 51% threat is very real.  Ghash.io is not going to act irrationally forever.  Until P2P mining becomes the norm this risk is unavoidable.  This is the scenario where the deep pockets can really blow up the system; even a few big double spends out in the wild and faith in BTC would evaporate. 
A few more notes:
Bitcoin2.0 as described in  is already being worked on, or may even already exist.  The chaos of the altcoin community is the new Wild West and many interesting and perhaps valuable variations are being tested every day.  Transaction speed, block size and anonymity have already been greatly refined in the alts relative to bitcoin.  In fact, if you follow the conventional hedge logic of 1% of your assets in BTC, the same logic would lead you to .01% in complementary (but different) altcoins, most likely in some split between flavors such as Scrypt (LTC being most popular), ring signature (Monero, DarkNote, X11...), multihash (Darkcoin, Frozen, Quark...) true dark horses (Peercoin, Freicoin, Devcoin...), and, to be brutally rational, IPO coins (Counterparty, XRP, NXT, Mastercoin...). 
As you pointed out earlier, killing off all the BTC (or any other transition) is going to take some time to accomplish.  BTC hodlers will have opportunities to hedge from a very advantageous position into dollars, Litecoin, clamshells or whatever store of value arises in the vacuum.
Based on recent history, the most dangerous threat to the value of your bitcoin is yourself.  Estimates of the current number of accidentally killed coins seem to cluster around the 1,000,000 mark.
Finally, there is Satoshi.  I put this at the end because now i am opining rather than stating probabilities based on current facts and historical precedent.  Like it or not, Satoshi's hoard functions as a Central Reserve of the bitcoin ecosystem.  If those coins move without a public explanation, there is going to be one hell of a run on the market.  I trust Satoshi not to do this, and in fact think it was part of his plan.  In your 'coin killer' scenario, the people buying up the coins would have to be aware of the fact that Satoshi would have the ability to counteract their move with a flood of liquidity.  The timing and methods would be up to him, and Satoshi is a very clever entity based on his track record.  IMO this would act as a powerful deterrent to someone looking to corner the market.
So thanks for making me think through my set of assumptions again, it's good to keep testing my reasoning.  Hope some of it was helpful.  If anyone can find areas (other than the opinions about Satoshi) where i have missed potential alternatives please let me know.  The most difficult risks to manage are the ones i can't see.
tl;dr  the only real enemy is apathy

Reasonable arguments.  I hold out hope that the higher cost/hash but lower cost of entry will encourage more adoption, gradually negating the core of your argument.  Also,  hope you realize that the difference in block time targets has some influences, both positive and negative, on both protocols' resistance to 51%.
Verging into opinion at this point, but i think the average LTC miner is a different animal than the typical BTC miner, and would hazard a guess that they would be more active about securing the network.  
Frankly, i have been disappointed to see Ghash's numbers climb again and p2p adoption stall.  I would like to think our cohorts were wiser than that.

Verbatim- "When a government overvalues one type of money and undervalues another, the undervalued money will leave the country or disappear from circulation into hoards, while the overvalued money will flood into circulation." ergo, two types of money.
While many use the debasement of same denomination silver coins as an example, Gresham did not limit his theory as you suggest.
As for Thier's Law, it specifically speaks of 'acceptance'.  If you are the buyer in a transaction, you would be incentivized to use the opposite strategy.  This is not the opposite of Gresham's Law, rather just another view of supply and demand.
Gresham's Law addresses the concept of 'hoarding', while Thier's basically repeats the refrain in terms of vendor preferences.
But let's not dwell in ivory towers of theories!  Since i don't seem to understand, how about you enlighten me with just ONE example of your premise, that Thier's Law opposes and or negates Gresham's Law in practice.  In return i can offer dozens of examples, both present and historical (both your narrowed definition of Gresham as well as the broader) of Gresham's Law at work.

I understand that my ideas disagree with many modern economists.  I am okay with that.  You should know the source of the ideas you are defending.
I say 'bad money drives out good'.
You say 'good money drives out bad'.
Let's get to the heart of what 'drive out' means: greater circulation (monetary velocity) than the competitor.
According to you, the dollar is driving out the peso.  Put another way, the velocity of the dollar in Argentina is surpassing the velocity of the peso.   This is simply not true (until the very last moment when the peso becomes worthless).
My point more broadly is that both of the definitions are faulty, and more specifically that the velocity of the peso in Argentina will increase until it becomes worthless (as people try to pass the less valuable currency along as quickly as possible).  I would agree that the velocity of dollars and bitcoin will also increase as people seek refuge in other stores of value, but the velocity of dollars will not *surpass* the velocity of pesos.  It is precisely the runaway velocity of the peso (too many pesos chasing too few goods) that creates this situation.
My broader point is that people use different forms of money differently; some forms they try to spend (i get airline miles!) and some forms they try to save (these gold coins will increase in value).  I believe that there is a third function as well, indexing value, but that is outside this specific case.
You have correctly pointed out that government enforced parity gives the advantage to the buyers, as the sellers are left with no choice as to what to accept.  But then you make the leap that the in the free market the sellers (suppliers) get to choose what to accept, causing the 'opposite' case to happen.  In a free market, buyers have choices as well, and we end up with all those neat supply and demand curves, consumer and producer surplus, etc...  Since we are all wear both hats (buyer/seller) at different times, we make one choice as buyers and a different choice as sellers and (in the simplest sense) hoard one and spend the other.
To claim that in a free market buyers have no choices, or even that those choices are subordinate to sellers (supplier) demands, puts you squarely in the Supply Side camp.
@_date: 2015-05-23 02:17:50
For starters, i will assume you can google Gresham's Law and figure out the implications it predicts.
However, money does not serve just  one function.  What we think of as 'money' is actually three things: a means of transaction,  a store of value, and a value index.  Examples:  If you got a million dollars in pennies, you would have to convert to store the value; if you got 1000 pounds of gold you would have to convert to buy a pizza; and finally, prices change as supply and demand shift.
Gresham was right, but (IMHO) there will be 3 winners in the currency race, not just one, because no one unit can outcompete in all three arenas.  Bitcoin has first mover advantage, but CN coins are far superior at obfuscation.  In the end they are complimentary, not competitive, and obviously all this is on a relative rather than absolute scale.
This is my own original idea, so i don't have any links or studies to back me up, but i have seen it in practice in Argentina, Brazil, and Cuba.   You can see it today in Venezuela.
If i had to come up with a case study, i would probably choose the (IIRC)10 cent coins used in phone booths in Argentina in the 80's.  Even as the country suffered through hyperinflation, the phone tokens held constant value (as the represented an actual service) right up until people tried to use them as an investment tool, at which point they cratered.
Traveller's cheques are another example/  Don't bring traveller's cheques to inflationary countries.  After constantly being screwed over for 20% by the banks, i changed the whole lot out for $100s in a dark cement basement in the slums of Buenos Aires at 3am.  They only charged me 5%.

Thanks for the interest.
About your response: Two doesn't work; one will always cannibalize the other.  Three is necessary to achieve balance.  Rock paper scissors isn't much of a game if you remove one element.
The simplest explanation i have seen is 'we'll buy houses with bitcoin, drugs with moneroj and coffee with [fill in the blank]'.
You are correct that the transparent ledger makes Bitcoin ideal for the value index; you can see how much the car dealer got for every other car he sold.  This is not a good trait for store of value; nobody wants to advertise how much they have stuffed under the mattress, that is why it is hidden in the first place.
The remaining transactional leg must be filled with something that complements the weaknesses of the previous two: slow transactions on large blockchains.  The third leg has to be able to compete with Visa in speed and scale pretty much right out of the gate.  IMHO, i have not yet seen a real contender.
Thanks for your encouragement, i will check out those subs.  As for my wild speculation, i think the appearance of the 'Third Leg' of the pedestal is what will catapult cryptocurrency into the mainstream.  Without it, OP's question that starts the thread is completely true, and many potential adopters will continue to steer clear.
@_date: 2015-05-24 00:05:27
OK, now i get it.  You are about terminology rather than concepts.   The story has been the same over many centuries in many languages.  For me the terminology and names of the actors are easily interchangeable.
We are both saying the same thing about Argentina.  People are tying to spend pesos and save dollars, the only difference being that you seem to think people stuffing dollars into mattresses is putting those dollars INTO circulation.  The classic error of Supply Side theory.
Personally, i have never agreed with the logic of Supply Side Economics. However, i can see how if you follow that kind of logic you could come up with the idea that sellers dictate terms and can choose which bills to accept from your wallet.  I have never found that to be the case in the real world.  A more realistic example for you to use would have been discounting, or the dollar denominated mortgages underwater today in Russia.  I was looking forward to a good discussion of these types of issues, but now i see you are just trying to be pedantic.
As an aside, both Rolnick and Weber were big proponents of centralized national banks, so you might want to draw the line on where you stop agreeing with them.
Finally, it's not my definition.  That's just your Straw Man.  From the outset i have been trying to refine the broadest definition of the concept popularly known as Gresham's Law (which is at least two thousand years old).  If it makes you happier to say someone else doesn't understand because they don't use the terms of 80s Supply Side Economists, then don't let me stand in the way of your bliss.

It depends on your risk tolerance and ethical considerations.
If you have a high risk tolerance, you are looking for coins that are low value and able to break out.  Lower risk tolerance points towards bigger 'brands'.
If you are day trading and only want to make money, there are many shitcoins being pumped daily.  If you are looking to invest in the tech that created this space, avoid anything that is flagged as 'premined' or 'not mineable' on coinmarketcap.com
Three recommends for each quadrant

 * LTC, ETH, DASH
Higher Risk/Real Tech
 * AEON, ZEN, QPL
Lower Risk/Pyramid
 * Ripple, IOTA, Factom
Higher Risk/Pyramid
 * Stratis, Waves, Lisk
If you do some research, you will see that each quadrant has a distinct target audience and motive.  Each quadrant will have its own winners, although eventually the market will test the Real Blockchain vs. Pyramid Scheme dynamic.

This is a very interesting question.  Disclaimer:  Not Muslim.
Both the Quran and the Bible have prohibitions against usury, but the specific topic here is really the time value of money; I think it would be easier to present this to your father as the 'Time Value of Work'.
Bitcoin is a Proof of Work protocol.  Every Bitcoin was earned by doing mathematical calculations, there are no 'free' bitcoins.
Contrast this to Fiat money.  These are all instruments of debt, or 'Slow Motion Usury'.  There was no work performed to create more fiat.  Because of this, banks MUST pay interest in order to stimulate demand.  This directly contradicts the Muslim concept of Riba.
Your father probably agrees that the price of a job (the cost of 'Work) can change based on circumstances.  If you need something done immediately, it is generally more expensive than being able to schedule a better time.  A bushel of wheat costs more at planting than at harvest.
Bitcoin is a reverse 'harvest'.  Bitcoin miners are willing to sell their 'work' to you in exchange for your money, which you get from your work.  The miners who 'harvested' at the best time are willing to sell cheaper than those mining at more expensive prices.
Because of the revolutionary deflationary nature of bitcoin, you will never need to charge Riba on a bitcoin loan.  The work compounds in value due to the structure of the protocol.
A repayment of 1 BTC after 1 year has the same functionality as an interest loan, except without the interest.  This is exactly what the religious prescriptions are recommending.  Economics was not yet a science, but our forefathers understood the dangers of ballooning debt and credit.  Bitcoin meets all these needs perfectly, while being competitive (or, really, superior) with modern forms of payment in terms of speed and security.

Several thoughts on your post-
* You are not late to the game.  You still have every opportunity to make a choice.


* It is not about 'work', it is about 'risk'.  The early people took much bigger risks than the one you are being offered right now.   If you have an appetite for that kind of risk, there are even more opportunities available in the altcoin space.  The debate that is happening on a technical/financial/political level is amazing.  Some  really interesting projects.
* Thanks for asking valid questions.  Your questions are ultimately based on your perception of 'risk' in $.  The more you know, the  worse the $ looks medium and long term.  Ask a historian, an economist, a manufacturer, or a banker and you have a 50% chance of getting an answer that indicates loss of $ value (and how that would be a likely/necessary/good thing).
* The situations are the same in either case, some people have to do more work than others.  So the only question is do you want to play on the table that is more fair or less fair?  Personally i see a hedge situation as the best way to manage a risk.

Another post laughing at Putin's Russia.
If anything, it is Putin who should be laughing these days.  And to suggest that Russians are backwards at data analysis or cyber security is naive.  Look what Vitalik was able to accomplish on his own, and than imagine how many resources Putin can point at this project.
I see two options
* A.  Putin is bluffing some bullshit
* B.  Putin has a plan to acquire marketshare in crypto
If it is option B, I doubt he would make a public statement until they were pretty close to release.
Also, I can't wait to hear Trump's first statement on cryptos.

Really cool idea, but the UI could be so much better.  Ask yourself, *are tables really the best choice to display meaning of the data*?
2 examples: 
* sorting by market cap would make the site much easier to focus on most popular coins.  How many mouseclicks/keypresses to get the top 20 MC coins onto the page w/ the current setup?  Many more than I care to count!
* All Time High is *time series* data.  The pertinent info is the relationships of ATHs. both across coins and vs. previous ATHs.  Your idea has the potential to present this data in a powerful visualization (instead of tables).  Right now there is now way to visually see (for example) 'which coins had their ATH *after* btc?'.  Tables are constraining your potential.

A local credit union.
There are scores of stories of problems with every large bank.
Story time;  i had a Wells Fargo account. I asked the bank manager this same question.  Having never heard of btc, he said 'I don't see why there would be a problem'.  Next week he flags me down from the teller line and invites me into his office, where he explains he has just had a manager's conference about bitcoin.  He then explains that just for having the previous conversation, my account has already been targeted for increased scrutiny.  I say, 'No problem, everything i am doing is perfectly legal.  If you can just tell me what i CAN'T do, so that i can avoid hassles, i am fine with whatever disclosures you require.'  He answers, i shit you not, 'Well, i can't divulge that information.  Just know that your account could be suspended at any time without notice.'
There was more to the conversation, but the tl;dr is i left with a cashier's check.  Don't support big banks!

No, it is not safe.  Neither are Cassicius coins for that matter.  If the key has been compromised, the coins are not 'yours'.
I don't understand what you are buying when you say 'wallet'.  Why wouldn't you roll some dice and create your own?  If you are just buying the coins in the wallet, why wouldn't you have them send the coins to an address you control?
This question, to me, is equivalent to 'Is is safe to buy my e-mail password from eBay?'.  No!  And why on earth would you do that?

Bitcoin is not anonymous, and the amount of 'work' (electricity required) has already become unsustainable.
If you really believe what you wrote, you should do due diligence to see if an alt coin exists that satisfies your brief.
P.S.  You  forgot fungibility, also becoming a problem with btc

Please don't strawman.  Let keep r/bitcoin rational
Basically, ASICs created a death spiral of specialization and centralization, part of which [bleeds over to electricity consumption](  People complain about sat/byte as fees, but the real costs are much higher.
Ask yourself this.  If you had to pay the real cost, would you still use btc?  If not, who should bear the cost? How?

Cool.  The part where they said 'only recommended as a hot wallet for small amounts' turned me off right away.


Or at least provide that option.  That has been requested as a feature, seems easy to do, and has been roundly shot down by the CTO.
This is also only one example.  If you google, there are lots of others claiming missing funds.  It has reached the point where some dev teams have refused to work with Jaxx.  The story of the Monero team was pretty enlightening (Jaxx tried to dictate terms and freeze development)
Finally, i don't like the answer 'Apple would never let anything like that in the store'.  If the incentive is great enough (widespread Jaxx adoption), somebody will trojan into an otherwise benign app.  Simply put, we all can agree that Jaxx is the most easily compromised of the popular wallets.  There are better choices.
@_date: 2017-07-17 06:17:43
They cut too many corners.  When they have been approached about security issues with their wallet, they tried to bullshit their way out of it.  Jaxx is not secure.

Ok, ELI6
There is a fork coming.  The will be a winner and a loser.  If Coinbase (or Circle) is holding your coins, you have no choice which chain your coins are on.  If you move them to your own wallet, you can weather the storm and then YOU get to choose which chain to be on.  With enough patience, you can be sure to be on the winning chain and not risk being on the losing chain.
Mycelium is my recommended wallet.  Should take 10-20 minutes all told to install a wallet and move out from Coinbase.

I tried Gyft.  It sucked so hard it changed my view of how badly a business can be run and still operate.  
Crazy permissions for the app and the fact that you **must install the app to your phone** were just two of the hidden surprises not listed in the TOS.  There was a reason i went to the website first; to make sure i wouldn't fall into exactly this trap.  The news doesn't drop until after they hear the cash register ching.
Seeing as i disagreed with the way i had been misled, i contacted customer service.  No refunds.  The fact that they tried to make it seem like a technical issue rather than simply their chosen policy was also rather galling. 
So i sold my Gyft card (that i would never use) at a 20% discount to a co-worker who tends to loudly espouse 'If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear!'.  I figured his new iPhone6 was not concerned about TOS.
He was somewhat embarrassed at the checkout when the QR code would not redeem.  I had gone with him as part of the agreement, so i had to give him his money back (as well as cover the extra 20% just to remain cordial as co-workers).  At least we both can laugh about it.
The Gyft story is now at the top of his rotation of 'Why Bitcoin Will Fail' stories around the office.
Also, after both of trying twice more with Gyft customer service, we have given up on recovering the money.  They seem to be very effective at sending 'How would you rate our customer service e-mails', but apparently they never actually read them.
tl;dr Gyft is a cancer in the btc ecosystem.  I hope they crach and burn quickly so that someone else can fill that niche.

Wow, a reply from the man himself!  Thanks!


Well, obviously i can't read the stuff on your Slack channel, but i can read the stuff on the public monero dev log, so i definitely got a lot of the story.  You guys don't look good.


Singling fluffypony out is also a strawman argument, he doesn't make decisions by himself.  And how could he 'cut off' Jaxx users but not others?  This makes no sense.  They are going to maintain continuity of their blockchain as a matter of course; anything else would be suicide.  What i read b/w the lines here is 'it is [too difficult/too much work/beyond our ability] to maintain integration with a developing crypto'.


This is the problem.  Why do we all have to change to meet your needs?  You are the wallet; you need to integrate.  When BTC forks, will you blame the forks for incompatibility or will you update your software?
But now let's look at the bigger issue.  You work for a company that is getting bad press.  People say they are losing funds.  People are saying your software is insecure.  I, as a consumer, have a choice to make.  Do i believe them or do i believe you?


First, you could be more diplomatic.  The tone i have seen you use has seemed 'dismissive' to me.  Especially in the monero discussions, i think you could have been more patient and open to compromise.
Here is another example, reminds me of Andre the Hulk.  I have to choose between people saying 'trivial' and you saying 'impossible'.   Impossible is a pretty high bar; a concise description of the errant logic on the other side is what i need.
Which brings us to sandboxing, your description of the logic error.  You admit the caveats of rooting and jailbreaking; the flipside is anything not rooted is under Apple's control.  They can brick it, make it phone home, key log it, or whatever they want.  It is not 'impossible' that these things can happen; the more successful you are the more likely they become. 
Your answer of 'ease of use' is understandable but inadequate when we are talking about cyber security.  The correct path (IMHO) is the strongest security you can possibly have, and then give users the option to downgrade for ease of use.  You decided ease of use was more important than security.  To me, that is a bad look in this space.
I don't want to come off as a crank.  I think the idea of a multi currency wallet is awesome, and i think you have huge potential in your product.  I wanted to love Jaxx when i saw it.  But i have not been impressed with your response to criticism, and it seems like you are unprepared to be a market leader.  If you scale up, will you succeed or will you be crushed by it? The Karpeles style isn't going to cut it anymore; if you want to lead in this market you have to be the best at a lot of things, PR included.
Sorry for the wall of text.  I have more to say but I don't want this to be an argument.  I am not looking to change your mind or cast aspersions.  I really hope you succeed, but i know what you are attempting is very challenging and has a lot of variables.  I just appreciated the response from you and just wanted to let you know how i see it from the consumer side.  Sorry if it came of as harsh.

you are correct, and it is easy to see the hoarding going on.
however, you will still buy your milk with coins, just not bitcoins.  in the past, milk was bought with silver, not gold.  gold was much more valuable, and used to buy things like ships and castles.
litecoin is the current leader to become silver to bitcoin's gold.  litecoin adoption is ocurring much faster than bitcoin adoption did, and having two on the board at the same time produce a natural peg.  as soon as there are two on the board you can't stop the triangle, and things start to change VERY fast.  litecoin may be growing too fast for the greater good.

It sounds harsh because that is the way it is written.
Your quote "transfer of virtual currencies" does not include US dollars.

Localbitcoins.com definitely falls into this category.
While i would hope the the US courts would not take such a draconian view, i would be naive not to prepare for the possibility.  The more we can generate discussion, the more hope there is for a clear and reasonable guideline from FinCen.

True dat, but i don't think the Baby Sitter Coop problem is as bad as it was on Capitol Hill.  In that scenario there was only ONE service with no substitutes or complements, and remember who you are talking about.
It's very possible that 'less' deflationary is just fine, and anyways the babysitter problem is quite a ways off.
The BTC community is very good at math.  They will see this trend much better than Bernanke ever could, and there will be plenty of time for InflateCoin as well if needed.

i took advantage off the recent price swings to load into every cryptocurrency i could find.   they are all more or less pegged to the BTC, and so i spent one coin at 250 spread out over everything available.  when it crashed a few hours later, i did the same thing again with cash and got an even better deal.  Now i just have to learn about what i bought!  (jk, i went after PPC, i think it's way undervalued).
the 'hoarding' argument that you mention can be fixed by a second currency for daily use, a 'silver' to bitcoin's gold.  the current market leader is litecoin, which dropped to $1.5 during the recent btc selloff.  It was trading around $3 for while beforehand.

you guys are on it.  this is called sometimes called Dark Demand.
it is demand for a currency that never shows up on an account ledger, and it actually goes much deeper than that.
for the last forty years, drug deals and arms deals have generally been denominated in dollars, chosen for their stability and availability.
for these same reasons, if you look under a mattress in a 3rd world hovel, whether it's africa, asia or south america, it's probably dollars that they are trying to hoard, and these masses of poor add up to a lot of demand as well, far more than the drug dealers.
estimates for the amount of Dark Demand (i am quoting from back in school, can't link a source right now) on the $US range from 3% to 15% in general, with most settling in at 9% to 11%.
Today, more people on the planet have cell phones than toilets.   The dollar will get blindsided by a 10% club if these poor cell phone users figure out what this can do for them.
Also, the amount of Dark will definitely increase in the US itself.  Locks keep honest people honest.  Once the locks are off, we will get to see people's real nature.

Let me count the ways:
Despite being the eldest and richest exchange, they have the most problems with implementing technology.  It has taken them how may months now? to implement a new trading engine.  In the meantime two guys coded a faster one from scratch in C++.
They suddenly demanded verification requirements on ALL withdrawals, including BTC, with no warning.  What other drastic changes are they willing to make with no warning?
They make teaser announcements about LTC, in order to manipulate the market price.  In the meantime China just went ahead and started trading LTC, and left the empty Gox promise of LTC adoption dangling.
The shitty lack of support.
The deliberate delays on their part in (both fiat and BTC) withdrawals, in the hopes of shoring up their liquidity problems.
The fact that they have the highest trading fees.
The fact that they were the first to roll over and be a lapdog of the US Gov't, despite never being legally required to do anything, and despite the fact that they are in Japan.
I could go on, but that should suffice for now.

Discussion about the Senate hearing is almost all bullish.  Anything short of criminalizing bitcoin immediately is 90% probable to result in a price rise.  If we get through the next few hours, my forecast for the next two weeks is a peak of ~$700 ($741 on gox, if you want to get specific) and then retracement to ~$450-$500.
Check my post on if you want more detail about why i think we are about to defy technical indicators, which i normally value above everything except fundamentals.

I am going to do this for you, just as an experiment.
To be clear, it think it is a TERRIBLE IDEA.
The idea of compounding interest with a deflationary tool like bitcoin is just vicious.  IF it works as planned, once you get behind, you will never catch up (i think. that is why i want to see how the experiment works).  Hence the old biblical prohibition on interest;  with Bitcoin, the appreciation of value itself is the interest.
I suppose it could work, but i predict strange aberrations where as a lender, it becomes in your best interest to not only forgive the late payments, but to accept a lower rate of return (fewer BTX than were loaned), because the other option is accepting nothing at all.
But i will bite b/c I'm curious as hell about this.

Here is the most important sentence
Those who use virtual currencies exclusively for common personal transactions like receiving payments for services or buying goods online are not affected by this guidance.
You are allowed to buy or sell w/ BTC, but if you trade (even once) you are a money transmitter.
@_date: 2013-11-11 19:24:40
r/bitcoinmarkets speculates on this question all the time.
The answer at the moments is that the technicals indicate a current floor of 280; if it goes lower than that, it will go A LOT lower.  Most tech analysis traders are still predicting a sell-off, but only to $300.
On the other side is the hype machine.  The amount of press coverage and fiat money flowing in right now indicate a strong rise to $410 by Friday.  Bullish end of year forecasts tend to be around $700 on the low end.
Another point to consider are the Nov 18 Senate hearings.  The price is most likely going to make a strong move off of this news, either up or down.  I would make your decision and be prepared before this news hits, because it will happen so fast that timing it faster than the more experienced traders is HIGHLY unlikely.  If i were you, i would do a 50/50 split of my available resources at this point.

You painted with a broad brush and made almost no distinctions, and consequently gave poor info.  the reasons you list for avoiding alt coins have all been used against bitcoin as well.
Why not teach your readers to look for distinctions, such as what a 'premine' means and how to recognize one?  Or you could focus on the standards of the more reputable devs, such as Sunny King and the things he did to make Peercoin and Primecoin succeed both 'commercially' and as alternative ways to leverage network strength.
RE: Opencoin,XRP,ripple is designed to be a centrally controlled electronic payment system.  1/2 of all XRP to be held by the issuing corp.  No limit on new issues.  Designed to facilitate bank transfers, in order to make banks play a larger and more accountable role in money transfers.  Bad bad news for bitcoin if it succeeds, as it will co-opt many of the services btc could offer, and more importantly XRP will allow the Fed to remain firmly in control of monetary supply.
Limited supply is one of the cornerstones of Bitcoin, as both a protocol and a philosophy.  Understanding how the different alts approach this issue is also a key distinction in determining how they differ.  Just learning about reasoning behind, for example, the demurrage of Freicoin or the Devcoin common redistribution can teach you many things about monetary theory which will eventually come to bear on Bitcoin as well.
The first big success in global networking, the internet, changed the way everyone views the world.  Even those without a computer understand the importance of the internet.  If Bitcoin succeeds, it will change the lives of even those who choose not to use it.  The alts will have their day as well; if they can prove greater utility than the status quo then they will grow, and possibly even outpace btc.

I wasn't the on who said it was a report on bitcoin, i am just trying to use discussion to promote clarification of FinCen guidelines.
According to my (and others') understanding, the word 'exclusively' (which also appears int the March 'guidance') is the important phrase.  This means traders ARE money transmitters, as is anyone who trades dollars (or any other fiat currency) for bitcoins on the street.  There is nothing about a third party, the definition states that if you trade bitcoins for cash (or any cash substitute), you are a money transmitter.
I would hope that the law would not interpret these guidelines in the most strict sense possible.  My fear is that they will.

Wow, what a week.
First, let me say that i am not an expert.  Please do not take this as advice. I'm just laying in bed watching the ticker and thought it would be fun to share ideas bout what is going on.
Gox made the trading free in order to pump up volume.  This should, in theory, produce a stable price through trade acceleration.  Interesting gambit for a company having trouble with scaling.
In anticipation of the coming bloodbath.  I decided to take a nice long nap.  Then some quality time and a nice dinner.  I was talking with my roommates over dinner when it hit me, why the hell aren't the bots just taking care of this?
Two minutes later Gox went down due to traffic, most likely from bot trades (as i see the pattern).
The imminent effect before the trades stopped posting was clear: prices were going to center around $100.
When trading resumed, everybody and their dog was bidding 110.  I sure as hell was, because my thoughts were that if prices stabilize at $100, i'll be willing to pay a 10% premium in order to lock in now.  Apparently i was not alone.
So prices jumped to 100, and the band tightened again.  I predict another bot wave in 30 minutes or so, when the computers will try to solve this problem with logic, and prices will stabilize at 110, at which point i'll bid 120 with everybody else, and we repeat the process again.
After we are full of false confidence and snug in bed dreaming of riches, somebodies gonna dump a load in the middle of the night and send it down to the floor again.  More bad press in the morning.
Another near miss at stability, another bloodbath.  But we are getting closer each time.
Just my 2cents.  Care to share your thoughts on what we are seeing?

This has been anticipated.
You have described the [Capitol Hill Babysitting Co-op]( problem.
While my econ professor was fascinate by the meaning behind CHBSC, it is not an accutrate view of the real world. Printing money only solved the CHBSC in the short term; eventually it would ahve forced some ugly competition and an attempt at monopoly.
IMHO the CHBSC did not work cuz:
1.  They tried to fix the price instead of float it.
2.  There were no substitutes or complements to create excess supply or slough off excess demand.
3.  Because we are talking about Capitol Hill.  When i described this to my mom, she pointed out the her babysitting co-op had the same system as Capitol Hill, and worked no problem, cuz people weren't assholes about it.

No prob.  A floor the level at which a commodity will no longer descend in price, it's inherent minimum value.
When you use the term 'My floor' you are stating the price at which you believe the price will no longer drop, and therefore is going to rise.  These are often expressed with confidence intervals (i.e. 30% chance that it goes to 70, 50% that it goes to 50, and 20% chance that it goes to 20), so the bid positions are constructed to reflect this.
If i have a $1000 worth of money to burn in the above (totally ludicrous) scenario, i would put 30% of the money in at 70, (bid 4.2875 @ $70), 50% of the money in at 50 (bid 10 @ $50), and 20% of the money in at 20 (bid 10 @ $20).
This is why it is important to have reserve cash in your account and not spend it all.  If you threw in everything at 70, you are going to get screwed when it gets to 20.  If you saved $200 just in case, you can trade your way out even if the price only goes to $30.
The real life floor is created by traders taking floor positions.  The events of the past few days are indicative (generalization ahead) that our market (mostly newbs) did not construct very good floors, and did not hold back enough reserves to combat floor collapse.  We did better after the time out, and we will keep getting better.

@_date: 2013-04-12 08:50:41
it's about market capitalization.  the reason for the wide range is the uncertainty about how many markets will be affected.  this question is on everyone's mind, but the key to remember is that the price of the coin really doesn't matter, it is the idea that matters.
for example, the US dollar used to be backed by gold in a big pile in fort knox.  the value of all the dollars was defined as the value of the pile of gold (more or less).  for a variety of reasons this system was abandoned under Nixon.
now imagine that bitcoins become used as the pile of gold.  if we use [these]( numbers even though they are way out of date (the true number is higher), we get 10.3 T divided by the current 6.5M BTC so each bitcoin represents a little over 1.5 million $US.
but that's just the dollars.  there is no reason that the BTC couldn't back the euro and the yen and so on.  in fact, there are many reasons that the market will choose to have it back many currencies.  now we are looking at a number that is at least 10x higher.
the articles also explains to difficulty in estimating M0 and so on at any given time, which is why i had to use old numbers for the example.  this adds another layer to the variance.  but $1 million per coin is not a high estimate by any means, it is in fact quite low.
@_date: 2013-04-14 17:54:52
The current volatility is a gold mine if you are willing to take a long position.  As we see more stability, more people will take long positions, and the volatility (and the gold mine) will go away.
When i express my concerns about interest with BTC, i am assuming we have achieved price stability.  Until then we are all just gambling, after that we are investing.
P.S.  Price stability does not mean a constant price in $US, just a constant store of value.  It is very likely that the $US changes in value would cause price changes against BTC.  Right now the volatility is in the BTC, my long term view is that the volatility is really in the $US.

Imagine bitcoin is a swimming pool.
The pool was built in a nice quiet spot by some very smart (but socially awkward) people who wanted a nice place to hang out and play.  They just wanted a pool that didn't have all the stupid rules of most pools, so they tried to have a pool with no rules.  They didn't mind if anyone joined them, and thought it would be great if everyone else came to to pool to swim as well.  But no one wanted to swim with nerds.
Then the potheads started hangin at the pool.  The nerds didn't bother the potheads, and the potheads didn't bother the nerds, but the pool started to be a cooler place to be seen now that it wasn't just nerds.
In the last three months everyone else found out how nice the pool can be.  They started showing up in crowds.
Some of these new people were refugees.  They came from other pools, and also wanted to keep things nice and quiet.  Most of the new people though, were inexperienced little kids(newbie investors).  It was their first time in a pool, and they didn't know the rules or how to behave politely, and started splashing in the pool (increased volume, increased volatility &amp; profit taking).  A little splashing started to turn into more splashing.  The pool was no longer calm, it started to turn onto a wavy mess.
The noise of all this splashing attracted some older kids with nothing to do (larger investors).  They were older and could always win the splash fights with the little kids.  Sometimes the little kids would get their feelings hurt and leave, which only caused the bigger kids to do it more.  Others started to leave, saying they would jut come back when the waves calmed down.  After all, it can't be wavy forever, right?
When the caretakers at the pool saw how much of a reaction they could get from the splashes, they built a secret high jump that can't be seen from below.  Whenever they wanted to, they could suddenly drop a cannonball from above without warning and watch everybody get startled.
Not all the older kids are mean, but once they saw a cannonball, even the polite older kids (traditional investors) realized this could  never be a calm pool, so they told everyone to avoid this rowdy pool forever, which suddenly made the pool less popular.  But at the same time, there are also hundreds of young kids who have never even been to a pool, and didn't realize there was even one open to them (people afraid of being left behind).  Even as everyone else was pushing to try to get out of the exit, all these little kids were pushing to try to get in.  The caretakers saw that there was a lot of pushing and shoving going on, and decided it was the prefect time for a cannonball.  This made everybody freak out.  They started pushing even harder, and a lot of people got their feelings hurt.  The scuffle got so bad that the entire crowd was put in 'time out' for a while.  As soon as 'time out' was over, some asshole decided it would be fun to do another cannonball right away, and they had to call another time out.  No one knows if the pool will ever be a safe place to swim again.
The nerds still run the pool, but they don't want to hang out while it's splashy. They are lurking quietly in the deep end, which they mostly still have to themselves.
The potheads decided the pool was too crowded, and found another pool to hang out in when the crowds shoed up.
The little kids in the pool just want to get out as fast as they can.  Even if they have to get beat up by the big kids one more time in order to leave, at least they get out.
The big kids want to stake out their own section in the middle of the pool by splashing everyone who tries to get to the middle.  This works pretty well, except for when someone drops a cannonball in the middle of their group.  Then they get soaked, too.
The little kids outside the fence are trying to find a way in.  They don't even know what a splashfight is, they just want to swim in a pool for once.
tl;dr  the pool will calm down as people grow up and behave better, and it becomes less of a novelty.  there will always be people who have never seen a pool trying to get in, and therefore it will always be a least a little splashy.  the best poo to hang at is always where the potheads are.

Very skewed view of alt coins, using many of the same arguments used against BTC back in the day.  There are many many different flavors of alt; author made no real attempt at informing the reader of differences and variations.  Caveat emptor, but beware of the risks of BTC as well.
The most alarming piece of misinformation in this piece is about Ripple.  In simple terms, if Ripple succeeds, it will steal MAJOR value from BTC.  Ripple = all the advantages of fiat married to all the advantages of crypto complete with someone to look out for your best interest by holding onto the wealth.

You have correctly identified an area of potential weakness.  When Satoshi designed the protocol, it was difficult to predict how robust the network would really be.  Because misplaced optimism was viewed as more detrimental than conservative choices, the protocol was designed with a 10 minute block target and and 10 tx per second limit, ensuring that even a weak network could handle the load.
The answers are varied.  The protocol is being modified to handle more tx per second, and some merchants (coffee shops) can accept 0 confirms while other actors (exchanges, for example) can choose to wait for a full 6 confirms.   Another highly likely scenario is that BTC gets superseded for day-to-day transactions by a crypto that was built for that, such as LTC, PPC or MNC, al of which aim for much quicker block times (~60 secs, off the top of my head).

its called scaffolding.  i'm doing it right now, and i'm not a bot.  you have to remember how the bid matching system works.
say we have 2 bids: 5 $100 and 5 at $90.
we also have an ask of 10 at $95.
i am sure that you can see that these balance, even though no one has agreed on a price.  this is happening all the time.
now let's blow it up.
bids 500 at $90 and 500  at $100
and ask 1000 at $96
almost balanced, all we need is someone willing to sell 1 at $1000. this is the scaffolder.
this example is oversimplified, but valid.
actual amounts for scaffolding need to be very small for it to work.

You are correct, but you are assuming only one currency.
First, BTC does not mean you cannot use dollars.  That option for spending is still there.
But if electronic currency really catches on, we will end up with at least one more, probably litecoin at this point, which will serve the purpose of silver to BTC gold.
So you buy your coffee with silver, but you keep your savings in gold.  Problem solved.

thanks for the update.  see you over at campbx

nice work, and good info.
while gox was down, other exchanges were trading and defining market price.  btc-e stabilized at 70, normally trades at 10% discount vs. gox.  btcc stabilized at $100, normally trades at 15% premium vs. gox.
i also think the 20$ day are long gone (though if we lucky we may get a few more quick chances)

Good question.  I only use online wallets that give me my actual wallet address, which is what enables me to check up on them.

Very interesting stuff, especially considering the source, but i think the analysis missed by quite a bit on the 'Estimated supply in 2014'.
13M btc will have been mined, but this is really just the upper limit of btc available.  For a variety of reasons, many of these 13M are no longer in circulation.  I think the true upper limit, which cannot ever really be known, is closer to 10.5M at the end of 2014.  Also, for other reasons, i think that there are another 2.5M that are, barring some kind of black swan, out of effective circulation.  This means the 'Estimated supply on 2014' is &lt; 8M, only 61.5% of then number used in the study.
tl;dr This means the prices quoted in the chart should be about 62.5% higher than those listed.

Good examples.  I was trying to explain this to my roommate today.
His question was 'why should BTC be more valuable than silver?' and i answered b/c you don't have to store it and you don't have to guard it.
You just answered 'why is BTC better than paypal?'
we also have 'why is BTC better than banking?'
and 'why is BTC better than Visa?'
Hopefully we have something for everybody.

Thanks for the explanation.  How would i get the private key of the created change address?

I don't have any money in gox, otherwise i would.  thanks for the heads up

finally somebody talking about value instead of price!  upvote for you, sir
@_date: 2013-04-12 10:25:45
i get crazy looks when i tell people the price really doesn't matter, but it is true.
what matters is the ability of the medium to exchange value, which bitcoin excels at.
i can give you examples if it helps.

Thanks for the explanation.  I am planning on giving out small amounts on paper wallets as holiday gifts this year, and so i want to be prepared to explain it to others.

Hey thanks sincitylife, i'm glad it worked out for you.  You definitely got me to check out Btcjam and change my mind about how these loans can work.  That said, there seems to be a lot of default as well, so YMMV.
I wanted to leave positive feedback for you on Btcjam, but i only have one point myself, and i'm not allowed to leave feedback til i get to 3 points, but i'll def hook you up when i get 2 more points.  Thanks for the experience~

Thanks for the link.

Thanks for posting this.  It's pretty clear after the last few days that Mt Gox needs to be replaced with professionals at this point 
@_date: 2013-04-12 07:22:49
You make a very valid point.  Average price for the year is $19.
This is the first time i have seen consolidation at 300% or better against the yearly avg (in Q1!) called a crash.

Thanks, that was very informative

Thanks for your reply and reasoned opinion.
Good stuff, but i don't really want to derail the thread.  I am now checking out more topical subs.
@_date: 2013-04-20 16:19:07
Let me see if i have this straight;  your question is:
'What is to prevent the online wallet keepers from loaning out my bitcoin?'
Short answer: the blockchain.  The blockchain will report any movement of bitcoin out of any wallet.  They can't actually move your money without letting you know about it.
