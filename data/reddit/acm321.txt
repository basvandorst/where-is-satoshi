I think "CommunityCoin" would be a good name, considering how nice the people at are.

I can see in now: "The price of BBQCoin has tripled to 30,000 in the last month. What's your take on this, Gary?" "Remember Bitcoin? Same thing. In a few years, BBQCoin won't even be able to buy a single rack of ribs."

I'll answer your questions in backwards order:
ASIC hardware is optimized for mining Bitcoins and other altcoins that use the SHA-256 hashing algorithm. They are much much faster than GPUs for this purpose.  Litecoin uses a "scrypt" algorithm, which cannot run on current ASIC hardware. Therefore the litecoins are most easily mined with a good GPU.
The 7950 is very good for litecoin mining - you'll get around 700 kilohashes per second with it. The 7990 gets about 1100 kh/s but the price difference isn't worth it. So yes, the 7950 is excellent for mining, especially litecoins.
Alright, here's my super-condensed litecoin mining tutorial:
1) Make sure your drivers are up-to-date.
2) Download [GUIMiner-Scrypt](
3) Make an account on a litecoin pool such as [Hypernova]( Hypernova is especially good because it has its own Android app.
4) Set up GUIMiner-Scrypt (what you downloaded earlier) just as you would the bitcoin GUIMiner (worker name, password, address, port).
5) Start the miner.
6) Set up an account at a cryptocurrency exchange such as [BTC-E]( Once you have an account, go to your settings and get your Litecoin recieving address. 
7) Add your litecoin address to your pool's auto-withdraw setting for whatever amount you want.
8) Once you start getting litecoins they will automatically transfer to your exchange account. Use the exchange to trade your ltc for btc.
9) ????
10) Profit.

BTW, since the Bitcoin difficulty is so high,without ASIC hardware it's actually more profitable to mine litecoins and then exchange them for Bitcoins. I switched yesterday and made about a dollars worth of litecoin, whereas it took me a couple weeks of bitcoin mining to get only 25 cents worth. 
As far as I know, though, there aren't any gui miners for litecoin so it can be a bit of a pain to set up if you're not used to command-line stuff.

I had .04 at one point, bought someone reddit gold when btc was like 150... I could have like 25 bucks!

Well, the standard conversion rates are 1 metric internet = 9001 cat pictures, each of which equal 100 karma. The karma/bitcoin rate from bitcointipbot is .002+ (Karma * 0.00000001) BTC So, 2 internets = .020002 BTC or about $12.18 USD @ 609 USD/BTC
