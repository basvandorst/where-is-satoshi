Great question. I don't see a good source to find BTC ATM locations.

Went over to Cassava earlier. Had a great empanada and talked with Jorge the owner. Apparently all major news outlets have been in to cover the Bitcoin ATM, yet only a few people to actually use it. 
I used it to sell some Bitcoin. Process was ok overall, although a bit cumbersome with an iPhone. Took about 2 minutes to confirm the transfer and then it dispensed the money as anticipated.

Why a Lamassu over a Skyhook?

You are correct, their is a 50k bond needed in my area. The bond allows you to have multiple ATMS though.

You are right he 100% wouldn't, because it doesn't meet his investment criteria. But given his strategies on when to buy, seems like a good time to buy.

I've read this story before, which seems to good to be true. If these number were being sustained I would expect BTC ATMs popping up everywhere.

Robocoin or Skyhook? Are there any others I am missing? 
Seems like Skyhook would be an affordable way to test the market before dropping 20k on a Robocoin.

Is the $3000 limit an Indiana law or Federal law? Link to more info? Thanks

Is the restaurant in the US? Is it an ATM (can buy/sell) or Vending Machine (can buy) style machine?
