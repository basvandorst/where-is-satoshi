Do you have any sources for this? The government doesn't have to recognize bitcoins as "currency" to require capital gains tax on profits made from buying and selling bitcoins. They don't consider houses currency, yet if my house appreciates in value (value being how much $$ people are willing to give me for it) and I sell it, the IRS requires me to pay taxes on the profits I have made. The government could simply view bitcoin as some digital collector's item, and we are nerds buying them because we think they will go up in value. Thus, the IRS wants you to pay capital gains tax on profits made from bitcoin trading.

Hmm I had not heard of casualty loss, this actually seems more appropriate. I will have to look into this, thanks!

I tried searching for tax information about virtual goods but most of it was about taxing online transactions, not investing in virtual goods (bitcoin might be the first real "thing" in that area). With a full understanding, I think that the IRS would consider bitcoins a commodity/capital asset worthy of capital gains taxes. I haven't studied this closely, but I would guess the spirit of capital gains law would support such an idea, even if the current law doesn't fully specify. Though you are correct, the nature of the bitcoin network makes it much harder for the IRS to scrutinize.

Yeah.. after thinking about it, the casualty loss [described below]( by s23423423423 seems to much more appropriately describe the situation. I think it would only be a capital loss if I actually sold the bitcoins for a lower a price than I bought them for, instead of just losing access to them.
edit: haha wow, you are the poster from below. that is funny

I just edited the OP and posted some info from the IRS that states I should be able to deduct from my wages.

Whether or not the IRS is likely to identify your bitcoin holdings and audit you is a different matter than whether or not you are required to report them. 
From the irs.gov link I posted in the OP:








It seems straight forward that the IRS would want you to report your bitcoin investment profits as capital gains . A rational person could understand this and also still morally disagree with the idea of taxation (or any other belief).

But they are not worthless play money, they are a freely traded commodity that have been going for around $15-16 each recently.
