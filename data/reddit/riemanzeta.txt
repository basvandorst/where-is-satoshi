2bn of 172bn is like 1.1%...

You are also an idiot. Watch the whole gif, and read some more context clues buddy. Let’s go back to the 3rd grade an improve those reading skills!

You are an idiot. Watch the entire gif, and read some comments. You’ve made some incorrect conclusions.

It still works as a currency... it’s just usually one side of a transaction will be upset. It’s necessary to turn it in to a currency though.

This is a very naive approach. He’s basically taking the price changes from last year and extrapolating them to all of 2018. This doesn’t take any external factors into account. Just think about it, if you could predict prices this way then any idiot with a computer could be warren buffet.

It’s that or some kind of payment schedule with a timeline of objectives set before. If both parties are smart about it, it’s usually pretty hard to get screwed. Just don’t send code unless you’ve seen some proof of payment. And don’t send payment until you’ve been shown that the other party has completed what you agreed to. It’s usually not hard to know if someone has actually done something without having the code in front of you.

Checkmate mate.

The payer pays the fees for transaction. Plus I don’t have to bother with anyone knowing my true bitcoin holdings. It’s the ultimate way to make bitcoin really.

You are like the prime numbers, unpredictable turns, unconstrainable, tantalizingly regular but never quite the same.
As my namesake, I’m like the Riemann-Zeta function. A rippled curtain of the imagined and real, deeply tied with you in ways incomprehensible.

1-5%... I’m literally at 100% crypto except a cash out once a month to pay bills. Safety is for pussies.

Whoever wrote this is an idiot. They took the most basic and simplest definition of decentralized. The idea of decentralized has nothing to do with geographical proximity. It’s about not having a constant intermediary (banks in traditional fiats) in order to make electronic monetary transactions. Also, the vast majority of people involved in bitcoin are young, technologically inclined individuals. That demographic overwhelmingly lives in major metropolitan areas. So it’s not really a surprise that nodes on the bitcoin network would cluster together in those areas. This paper makes me weep for the state of academia.

I’m a recent college grad. I can get by with just 500-600 a month. Honestly that’s more than I’d like it to be. I’m on a pure soylent diet so that saves considerable money. I spend the vast majority of time freelance programming for bitcoin. Saved up a decent amount.

I mean yeah... that’s why the price from all assets, from gold to corn never changes. All prices will always stay the same regardless. Econ 101 son.

You must be really worried about tether then.
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:56:10
Doesn’t really make sense.
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:48:17
Lol, if I was planning on selling would I be so happy?
@_date: 2018-01-23 01:29:11
Who said something about tether?
@_date: 2018-01-23 05:51:29
Most likely

I’m pretty sure adding a markov chain would help. Still very outlandish though.

You’re just salty no one is taking you seriously. TA is the biggest crock of shit to emerge from trading. I trade both traditional (options and futures) assets and I mainly just hold onto bitcoin. As both markets are incredibly chaotic/stochastic, you can never say what the price is going to do. All you can talk about is the probabilities of what the price is going to do. The exception is in traditional investing you might predict a big jump/fall because of some fundamental data that has been released, but that’s actually besides the point. The fundamental flaw in Technical analysis is that it assumes that people’s viewpoints aren’t dynamic. “Oh look, there’s a lot of people providing support/resistance at price1 and price2... this means the market will adjust, and get pushed up/down.” The flaw is what if the people providing resistance at some level change to support when the price falls down and hits a lower support level? The nature of chaos is to amplify subtle changes. So even if like 1% of traders change their minds initially, that can start a chain reaction to make all of your “technical analysis” completely useless. Technical Analysis just makes traders feel better about themselves. It requires just enough technical skill where traders can convince themselves that it all has to be true, and that they know what they are doing.

Yeah actually I did, glad to see green when I woke up.

I’m not going to claim I can predict it precisely, but there are usually indicators that let you get working a few percent (which is a good range for something as volatile as bitcoin). You can analyze the books, volume, and if you are good with machine learning sentiment analysis will probably be one of the best ways to narrow it down.

You’re an idiot. First learn how margin trading works in crypto currencies.
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:56:18
5x leveraged position with my entire liquidity value, so I only put up 1/5 of my liquidity. I only lose ALL of my money if price of bitcoin goes to 0, but I can't lose more than that. I'm not naive, so I don't consider the probability of bitcoin going to 5k-6k to be 0, and it if it breaks 6k, I'll close the position, wait for the bottom, and leverage more. We have Chinese New Year coming up, which is like Christmas on steroids. A lot of young Chinese kids will have cash to spend.

I’m probably going to get shit for this, but I bought at 8800 on 5x margin with a fifth of my net liquidity. To the moon boys. Before anyone calls me an idiot, I’m used to the ups and downs of crypto, and even if the price hits 7k, I’ll sleep like a baby.

It’s like a law of trading that the market will always over correct. Idk the stats from 2009, but I’m sure many people picked up cheap instruments. You just have to be patient.
