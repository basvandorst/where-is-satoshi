The Fractional reserve doesn't work either. You can't create that much money out of thin air and not expect problems down the line. It has created an imbalance with the amount of fiat in existance and the amount owed in repayments. There will always be more owed than exists and sooner or later the lenders will not be able to support their own debts

It has however increased it's value. Precious metals can't even keep pace with inflation. Sure, your 1k gold will still be worth 1k in 7 years, however the purchasing power of each dollar decreases as the currency is devalued
Gold is only useful for hedging against the dollar failing. If any of the world's major currencies collapse, I'd be more worried about survival than I would care about my portfolio

Deleveraging only decreases the amount of debt an individual or corporation has. It does not deal with a fractional reserve system creating 90% of the loan of thin air.
