The need to convert, really depends on how mainstream bitcoin is. If I was to spend BTC money, then I would need to know exactly who trades in BTC, I don't know about you, but where I haven't heard of anyone trading in BTC.
Edit: where I live..

In the [UK]( I think what might happen with that is that it would have to be declared as a secondary source of income, which would get an Emergency Tax code, and that would be heavily taxed.

Ok so walk me through the process.
You buy Bits, you try and sell them off at a profit, and then you would declare that gain to get taxed? Would you then wait until it has been taxed before you could trade again?

I can open current accounts/saving accounts across several banks without fear of having my accounts closed, and depending on the T&amp;Cs, gain interest on those accts, so how does Bitcoin compete with that, beyond political idealism?

I don't know about elsewhere, but in the UK, you must hold a bank account, in your own name to have employment/insurance, otherwise you will be refused on the spot (credit checks also apply).
Apart from [Paypal]( I am not aware of any other businesses that deal with BTC, so even if they were willing to, there is simply no process setup for that, that would be like asking me why can't you pay for a UK passport with BTC, the answer is you simply can't, you can't do it with Euros, Dollars, Guineas, you just have to use £ Sterling.

That sounds great, once you have the fortune, what do you do then?
Surely, you would have to contact the local tax authority to get that taxed, and with the examples that I have linked earlier, you probably wouldn't be able to convert that into Dollars/Pounds/Euros without risking closure of your bank account. So how do you make that work for you?

I'm not familiar with that, as far as I know, in the UK, an item has Value Added Tax (which is added on to the price), or it doesn't, I've never heard of a consumer having to find out if tax is owed on an item.  
I'm asking folks to talk me into it, because I don't see the benefit, but clearly you guys do, and I find that interesting.

Are you saying that if you don't convert BC to $ then you don't pay tax on it?

A purchase with bitcoin would have to be declared to the local tax authority, because that would be converted to the local currency?

How would bitcoin help me save money?

Is it though? I know that I can get 5% Gross Interest on up to £2k, with a current acct, with my bank, and that gets taxed without me having to declare anything.
Bitcoin is a great unknown for me, I know that there is a possibility of making gains, I know that I would then have to declare that to the tax man myself, and I know that my bank may then refuse to do business with me for using bitcoin.
That seems like a lot of risk to me for a reward that is unknown, and may or may not happen, so what I want to know is how you guys (who know a lot more about it), weigh up the risk and reward, and how you manage to get by.

There is the problem, you cannot afford to have banks refusing to do business with you, you need a bank account in your name, to have a job (to have your wages paid), and other things like insurance (to setup monthly/annual payments).
