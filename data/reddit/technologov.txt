It doesn't matter if Google adopts Bitcoin or not. Startups will. Why?
Because Google is Internet 2.0 (centralized cloud services)
While Bitcoin belongs to Internet 3.0 (decentralized cloud services).
Talented developers will be leaving Google soon.

Come on... 10,000 BTC is less than 0.1% of Bitcoin. Or less than 3 days worth of mining... it can't move the market much.
@_date: 2014-12-14 08:37:11
Simple answer: Bitcoins valued at $1 each means $13 million dollar market cap (13 million BTC exist now), which is nowhere near enough if some people or companies use it for store-of-value purposes. 
Small businesses work with millions, while big businesses work with $10s of billions of dollars. 
Put it another way, $13 million is too small to even pay salaries in Bitcoin.
Because Bitcoin supply is hard-coded only way to go is up.
I believe a fair price will be at least $100, 000 per Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-02-22 12:32:39

May I ask which tools did you use to generate blockchain-based reports ?
@_date: 2015-01-13 10:15:30
Nope. Wrong !
Because in Bitcoin, unlike Gold, even if 99% of all miners leave/go bankrupt/stop producing, the Bitcoin output will NOT decrease.
In Gold, or real-estate, for that matter, if something becomes unprofitable to produce, then production falls (producers go bankrupt), and output falls ! Not so with Bitcoin.

With 5 million users of Bitcoin,  that translates to 20 cents per user per day. Not much at all. And if we recall, that there is a mining halving next year, situation looks rosy.
Come on, we, the World, mine 75 million ounces of new gold every year. @ $1000 prices,  we will need $75 billion dollars per year entering the scheme for price to stay stable. This is $200 Million dollars per day ! Yet, over time, gold prices will go up vs fiat.

I'm not happy with over-regulation at all. 
It is the Free Market, that should decide.
My question is this: Why should Kraken actively block NY customers ? Why not simply let anyone trade, "weasel it away" without signing the regulation, but closing down all U.S. dollar accounts in all banks ? (Kraken trades mostly in Euro anyway)
American's can't close your fiat accounts, if those are denominated in Euros and only in European banks, right ?

The problem with Peter Wuille approach,  is that it starts off from a very small base of 1 MB. And growth at 17% per year is nowhere near enough compared to the amount of users, that double every year.  
17% growth can only make sense to mature networks,  with over a billion users. Otherwise it is a bottleneck. 
BIP SIPA is the equivalent of capping Facebook at 1 million users, and allow an increase by 17% per year,  right before the hyper-growth cycle.  Does it make any sense ? It would kill Facebook.

The problem is simple: with 1 MB blocks we can serve maybe 10 million people,  with $1000 bitcoins. With 100 MB blocks,  we can serve 1 billion users, to push Bitcoin prices to $100, 000 per coin. Do you want $1000 coins or $100, 000 coins in the future ? Being an investor, choice is easy. I will put my money behind the big block fork. Even if we have only several hundreds of full nodes, it is still good enough decentralization.

Having small blocks means network cannot grow beyond 10-15 million users. Do we want $1000 dollar Bitcoins or $100,000 dollar bitcoins? If the later, we need a billion users. We need a large blocks. No amount of fees and hocus-pocus is gonna change this thin pipe problem (1 MB block cap). The problem will hit us in a year probably.

filmfanatix: Your best bet is to exit college, work on two jobs for fiat, and buy BTC. (or open small business, if you feel like it). If I were you -maybe-, I would even take a long-term bank loan (&gt; 4 years), assuming reasonable interest rate, that you can pay-off from 2 jobs, even if BTC crashes. Don't take short-term loans (under 2 years). Make sure you repay the loan right after spike, by selling some BTC. Bitcoin does 3 steps forwards and 2 steps backwards, when it spikes.
Usually bank loan@ 10% rate is a bad idea, because most fundamental investments do much less. But Bitcoin does way more. Just make sure you repay loan as-soon-as-possible, after spike.
You do not have much time. Maybe few months, maybe a year till the next-spike. Bitcoin @ $200-$300 dollar range will not be for long.
Normally I would never advise my friends or other people to quit college. But Bitcoin is a special case.
@_date: 2015-07-26 13:51:35
Bitcoin bug, huh ?
You can slightly lower the prices for Bitcoin-paying clients (like -10%), and keep profits in BTC. This way ensures that more butterflies will see your flowers. (in reality, long-term deflation of BTC will compensate for profit loss)

There is no fundamental difference between a goldsmith 500 years ago storing your gold coins, and Bitcoin blockchain today, except Bitcoin is 100% automated, human-free, and global.

You need not stop. 21 BTC means you're one of the top million people. Or owner of one millionth of total future BTC.
You should keep accumulating BTC, as you would gold, until you find a good investment - business / stocks / real-estate. Note, that BTC in the next 10 years will appreciate faster than other kinds of investments, but after that, you should balance between all.
