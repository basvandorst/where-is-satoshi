The highlighted area on your graph does not show a 6000% rise in a year. 
A bubble has nothing to do with absolute values. 
Just because the value of all crypto currency is no where near the value of all dot com stocks, that does not make this *not* a bubble.
(I'm not saying that it is a bubble - just that it looks an awfully lot like one)

Funny, seeing as my economics textbook has a whole sub-chapter named “market bubbles”. I has the *tulpenmanie* as the first example of one and uses the 2007 uranium bubble as the example graph. Economic bubles are very real. 
Sure, it is uncertain science and the reasons are not understood. Doesnt make it not real, though. Yet, the whole thing about “people buying an asset above its intrinsic value”  makes no sense when talking about bitcoin, as there isn’t really an intrinsic value to begin with.
Yes, bitcoin has bubbled before and come out stronger. I think that will happen again. But to say that bubbles aren’t real or that this does not look like a bubble is just lame. Bitcoin could be one big bubble, for all we know. 
Also, that “dumb graph” is something that happens regularly in financial markes, for a number of reasons. Call it stupid all you want. It doesnt make it less of a thing. Arguably, bitcoin has had several major bubbles. Just like the US stock market. And it has eventually come out stronger. Just like the US stock market. Yet, they are still bubbles.

Wow, just a free fall atm.
Inpredict that when it hits 10k in two-three hours, the bottom will fall out and we will se prices dropping to around 2,500 within two-three weeks. Wont hit 10k again before next december.

Did you notice the “could” and “looks like”. Sure I am a noob. I have not invested a single dollar into crypto. I am merely studying for my economics finals in febuary, so please, do explain how those two graphs differ. Beacuse to me, they look *a lot* alike.
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:57:46
No one in this comment chain is talking about "beginning of the end". Me and others are merely pointing out that it looks like a textbook bubble. Because it does.
You keep talking about "lack of knowledge" and "noob showing", yet you are arguing completely past me and that other guy.
Personally I think that Bitcoin could go as low as $2-3-4000 before rising again. Because that is what would happen if this were to be a textbook bubble.
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:55:55
Down to $16k? Time to buy!
Down to $15k? Time to buy!

What you see could literally be a textbook example of an economic bubble bursting.
Which also isn't unusual.
But seriously. It looks exactly textbook. I guess that fear becomes captulation when it goes below $10.000 in ~~a few hours.~~ **half an hour**.
Edit: time
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:04:57
I pointed to a big rise (1000%) over the course of a year, followed by a dip of 30% in two weeks, then an (almost) return to the high, followed by an even bigger dip.
And said: “hey, that **looks** like this example of an economic bubble in my textbook”. 
Please tell me where that is wrong. 
I never said that bitcoin was going to die or whatever. 
You can call it a “market correction” all you want. You can also say that you “support” in stead of “invest. You can also say that you “hodl”in stead of “hold”. 
When this drop is over, it will likely be known as “the bitcoin bubble of (early) 2018”. That is my point. Just like there was a bubble in 2013 and one in 2011.
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:25:39
Obviously. As does a graph of any bubble. You can zoom in and out of any bubble to not make it look like a bubble anymore. That doesn’t mean that they are not bubbles, though. 
If you zoom out far enough, the dot-com-bubble and the finacial crisis of 07-08 also appear as mere “market corrections”.
You still haven’t explained how the two graphs differ.
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:37:17
It was a 1-year graph. There was only this one big rise, so there is only the potential of this one bubble. 
I don´t see any other bubbles.

@_date: 2018-03-15 19:49:46
The thing is:
I also believe that cryptos will play a major part in the future. 
I just don't want to be a part of this community beacuse it seems to be largely made up of toxic memelords with a victim complex and a generally horrible attitude. And even the ones that don't have this attitude are still too memey for me. I don't want to "HODL and believe". I want a way to diversify my portfolio via calculated risks.
I really think that this memeness is hurting the potential value of Bitcoin in the long run.
Sorta like how I could avoid investing in a company (even though I thought would be a good long term investment), beacuse all the other investors were people that I didn't want to associate with. That is how I feel about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-06 19:19:56
It has one *use*. Singular.
Meanwhile, gold can be used in anything from teeth to computers.

Okay? Did the dot-com industry die?

Are you for real?
@_date: 2018-03-06 20:42:45
Sure, I'm not arguing against any of that.
My only point is: Bitcoin has *one* use - being a currency.
Gold has a plethora of uses due to its properties as a cunductor of electricity and it being almost completely imperishable. 
It is being used in everything from medicine to satelites. 
But people here are super touchy and saying that "gold has more uses than bitcoin" (which is close to being a universal truth) is apparently sacrilege and worthy of downvotes.
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:11:39
No, you are right. It might *completely* die this time.
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:33:44


Couldn't the same be said for basically every other crypto?
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:42:22
I think you got some shit because it *is* basic math and not directly related to bitcoin.
Imagine an example:
You buy one bar of chocolate for $1.
The next week, chocolate prices double and you sell it for $2.
Obviously you have made $1 worth of profit. This is the same whether you buy gold or bitcoin or a house or whatever.
If prices increase by 100% before you sell, you will get 200% back of what you paid. 
If prices increase by 25% (like 8k to 10k in your example), you will get 125% of your $600, which is $750 (or a profit of $150).
Your question had nothing to do with bitcoin. You basically just asked people to do the math for you. 
I'm sorry if this sounds harsh, but until you understand how percentages work, don't invest in anything.
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:50:42
It wasn’t remotely a question.

What are you even on about?
I have made around 35k that I have pulled out and I still have my original investment of 10k just waiting to buy more. 
So no, I'm not gonna burn. I have made 35k in about a year.

Are you ignoring 90% of all the "HODL!!!"-posts?
@_date: 2018-02-05 08:34:09
You are right in everything, except for "a very high expected return." which is completely debatable.
That still doesn't *concretely explain* why mr. Average Joe would invest in bitcoin over whatever else, except that "he would expect monetary gains".
Blockchain is likely a part of the future, but it is still largely reserved to internet anarchists (in a lack of a better term), criminals and somewhat tech-savy people. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 18:09:36


Yes. And while I can only talk for here on Reddit, I can tell you that it is mainly caused by the lack of maturity of many “investors” on here. 
I started coming here while studying for my economics exam (now it is done and I’m just curious) and for a while I considered investing in Bitcoin, but the community here really scared me off of it. I can live with the hodling (although I find it horribly childish), but I can’t stomach the genral attitude of:
“We are the future of currency and if you even doubt that, then *fuck you* - you are just scared! Bitcoin *will* eventually moon beacuse this graph I just made says so... and *every* dip is due to bots dumping.
Oh, and all other cryptos are shit...” 
That, the supercilious aloofness and the endless stream of baseless predictions. People are being called “rats” for selling at a profit or even just consolidating losses. Wtf? I understand being overly optimistic, but why the hate against everyone that isn’t making you a profit??
How does this community tolerate stuff like this? It is actively scaring potential new investors away.
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:03:18


You just answered the question.

There is no fundamental value. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 06:06:52
Bitcoin is easy lol. I originally bought at 3500, then sold at 14000 (going down). I then rebought at 8000 and just sold at 10700. 
Now I'm waiting for it to go back down below 7000 (hopefully) so i can buy more.
For all you people saying "HODL" i just want to say: It's better to sell high and buy low. That way you *actually make a profit*.

If you trade Bitcoins, both revenue and losses will most often need to be reported to Skat (Danish IRS equvalent).
That is the conclusion that the Tax Council has reached, after having dealt with the issue for the first time.
"Vores konklusion er, at hvis man har købt bitcoins, så vil der typisk være tale om spekulation i skattemæssig forstand. Og spekulation er skattepligtig," siger Hanne Søgaard Hansen, der er formand for Skatterådet, i en pressemeddelelse.
"Our conclusion is that, if you have bought Bitcoin, it will usually be [a kind of] speculation, tax-wise. And speculation is taxable." Says Hanne Søgaard Hansen, chairman of the Tax Council in a press release.
From Børsen.dk
My own thoughts on this: 
This is thoroughly validating Bitcoin as a an asset in the eyes of Danish court, which is positive for crypto. It is seen as on par with buying stocks. 
The negative is that you will have to pay tax on any gains from sales. Losses will be partially deductible, though.
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:25:56
Digital scarcity does not give bitcoin an advantage over FIAT money. It only serves to give a percieved intrinsic value.
Also, FIAT money is perfectly viable for value transfer. Over borders or not.
Yesterday I received FIAT money, across a national border, from a family member. You know what fees were applied? None. 
I perfectly understand the advantages of Bitcoin and blockchain technology. 
But you didn't answer the qustion, though. "Why would John Doe of Bumblefuck, Arkansas currently invest in bitcoin?"
"Digital scarcity" is a concept, not an answer to that question.
The answer is: "he wouldn't"
Unless he was buying drugs online, he would have no use of Bitcoin, compared to US dollars. 
It could be a good investment, sure. But so could a penny stock.

Permanence and, more importantly, **stability** is of paramount importance when it comes to value storage, which is why *gold* has been the dominant means of value storage for most of human history. Because it is very stable.
Just like why the US dollar is the prefered reserve currency of the world. It is as stable as currencies get.
Zimbabwean dollars are every bit as "authentic" as US dollars, yet you see litereally no one storting value in them.
