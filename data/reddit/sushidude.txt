There are no YouTube advertisements on the acceptable advertisements list.


I am pretty sure that never happened. Care to provide a source?

You are spreading FUD. The acceptable advertisements list was never a secret. In fact, it was discussed and debated publicly for months. You seem to be under the impression that advertisers are essentially bribing the developers to let their advertisements be shown, which is completely false. Not only did [a user survey]( reveal that only 25 percent of Adblock Plus users are strictly against any advertising, **all** of the advertisements on the acceptable list must follow [this]( set of guidelines. Guidelines that, as I stated earlier, were publicly debated for months. Your claim that they only made acceptable advertisements optional after people complained about it is also completely and utterly wrong; the acceptable advertisements list has and always will be optional.

There is a lot of confusion, misinformation, and FUD around the AdBlocks.
There are AdBlock, AdBlock Plus, and AdBlock Edge. Filters are the lists of what advertisements to block. The filters that are used for every project are maintained by AdBlock Plus. Current filter lists for Adblock Plus have around 50 thousand filters which have to be manually maintained and kept up to date. AbBlock Plus is free and open source software. AdBlock is also free software, but they are significantly less open about their development. AdBlock Plus has the **optional** non-intrusive ads list which is enabled by default. All ads on said list *must* conform to [this]( set of guidelines. AdBlock Edge is exactly the same as AdBlock Plus except that it completely removes the option to turn on acceptable ads.

No, but [Flattr]( does.

There is major significance in choosing default settings, that is why acceptable advertisements were made default. The goal of AdBlock Plus is not to completely remove advertisements because they are paramount to funding many web based services, like Reddit.


I do believe that the user is informed of the acceptable advertisements list and how to disable it after installing the extension.


In the case of installers with extra software bundled with them, the intention is completely different.
On a somewhat unrelated side note, you should be using a package manager anyway.


There is nothing inherently wrong with for-profit companies. It is good to see that AdBlock Plus has funding to be further developed and maintained.


They outline how they selected users for the survey in [this article]( Judging from what they say, it does not seem biased.

If that is true, then can you please provide the sources of where you got that information?

HTTPSB actually has support for AdBlock Plus filtering as well.

Reddit is on the acceptable advertisement list.

I did not realize that. AdBlock Plus makes much more of point that it is free software. Nowhere did I see a link to the source code or even a mention of AdBlock being free software on the AdBlock website. I will update my original post.

You are wrong. Read [this]( comment by Klathmon, a Chromium developer. For context, he is explaining why there are performance issues with AdBlock Plus and how a significant problem is because it completely removes advertisements and does not just hide them.
Also, Ghostery is proprietary software. I have heard many good things about [Disconnect]( which is free software.
