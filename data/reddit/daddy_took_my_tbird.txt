But the thing is, they are not going to. Yes, it would be nice if everyone overnight decided to start donating to charity, but that's just not going to happen no matter how much you or I hope it will. That's why it's such a good thing when a business happens to be charitable and will **take money from people** for products and services and use a percentage of it **that otherwise would have never been given to a charity**, **and gives it to a charity** (or starts his own)
1% of billions and billions of dollars &gt; 100% of a few million dollars. (avg donations to charities are quite low)
But don't let my ideas of what is more effective stop you from donating. Please, by all means, donate. That's great. But also please recognize that people can also have an impact by supporting companies that are in a position to do great things with money from people that would have never considered donating.

You see which companies are selling the product you need, look at their CEO's past charitable efforts. If they are putting money where you would like money to be put, then spend money with that company. For example, if I liked bison burgers and really thought more people should know about them, I would spend money with Ted Turner's CNN. Or if I was a handicapped person I would make an effort to seek out companies that cater to my demographic by providing the best accessibility options both in software and hardware.
* "People got mad and the company cares about its PR, or it was regulated into doing that, or the owners of the company are so rich that making a moral move and losing money over it doesn't matter much to them. Again, Intel doesn't really deserve much recognition."
I wasn't crediting Intel for their moral compass. I was pointing out that people, whether or not it's Intel's owners, do in fact care. Otherwise no one would have talked about it and forced (presumably) their hand and made them either through force (legislation) or a bad PR campaign, change their ways.
* " If I trust Bill Gates' decisions, why don't I just buy the $60 product and then give $20 to Bill Gates directly? I can just send him a cheque instead of wasting money on middleman."
Very true. But what about the company's influence on his own pocketbook? With more sales, the bigger the company becomes and ultimately more well known the CEO becomes, charitable or not. Would we even know Bill Gate's name if no one had purchased Windows 95? Surely we would not. And therefore we would not have known he would be so very charitable indeed until after his company grew enormously. A sort of catch 22. However, now that we do know for certain his intentions with the wealth that his company has granted him, we can spend our money wisely on their products knowing ultimately the effect it will have as opposed to sitting in an offshore bank account marked Apple Inc. 
Here's the important part: The company has to continue to grow if the CEO is to continue his charity at an increasing rate. Purchasing a product from the company virtually guarantees this, whereas just donating to the charity does not, as the majority of the charity's funds come from shares in Microsoft, something donations themselves can not match (as assuredly) due to the nature of the stock market. In order to even come close, everyone would have to donate to the charity in lieu of buying the product from his company. It's much more simple, and likely, to just buy the product from the company.
* "I don't mean Gates' charity either, if his charity is good then we can donate for charitable purposes. Let's say the same thing happens with Amazon, should I just buy cheap products and send a cheque to the CEO, should I buy cheap products and donate the rest to charity, or should I buy premium products for companies that sort of seem moral?" 
The third option. It will keep that company in business and allow whatever moral project they have to continue. If the company is good, potentially they will become enormously charitable as seen with Microsoft, which gave rise to one of the biggest charity the world has seen yet. 
It's grabbing a market of people that otherwise would not have donated to ANY charity, and using their capital for the CEO's charitable habits, whereas the other CEO would have pocketed the cash. Only on a (hopefully) massive scale like what happened with Microsoft.

Electronics shows one listing.
Upon clicking it, I see no listing. The expanded Electronics directory shows Mobile Phone Cases as having the listing, so I click it. Again, no listing.
Not off to a good start.

Possible? Probably, yes.
Lucrative? No. Because you don't get paid until the phone bill arrives. Which could be a month after you send them bitcoins.

Not to take away from your point, but I think the subscription speed is picking up as of recently, even in spite of the treatment you mention,   because of the usefulness as a good source of news for all things Bitcoin.

I don't know why you got downvoted. I didn't fact check your numbers but offhand I think everything you said is correct.
Yes, a billion dollar company accepting bitcoin is VERY good news for bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-01-09 21:06:50
Here's a reason. 
Amazon's Bezos contributes many of his companies profits to space ventures. Do you like space? Maybe you would like to support this endeavor in a roundabout away, and shopping at Amazon instead of a competitor is a way to do so. 
Similarly, if you like Bitcoin, shopping at Overstock is an indirect way to support it and other people's businesses that happen to like Bitcoin.
Apple is currently sitting on billions of profit without a public plan to put to any real use. It's founder and current CEO aren't as philanthrophic as other similar companies and that might be reason enough to spend your money elsewhere. (See: Bill Gates)
@_date: 2014-01-10 04:12:38
Well they likely buy the products because they need them. From there they have a choice which one to buy, the one that goes to the guy who helps the world, or to the guy who didn't seem to care even about his daughter. No Microsoft isn't a moral company. And I don't think there's such a thing either. But the man who owns most of it happens to be very philanthropic. And does wonderful things. Apple doesn't. 
* "You can't just trust that some rich people will do good things, then your efficiency is something like ((the salary of the altrustic wealthy people * the percent of the salary they donate * the percent of altrustic people who are profiting from your purchases * how efficiently they choose to spend their money)/(all the profit generated by the stuff you buy)), which is a number much smaller than 1."
We don't have to trust them. Just look at their records. Bill Gates will continue to help the poor, Bezos invest in space tech, etc. They each have a history of this behavior and will very likely continue to do so. Also, if it is going to be attempted to be calculated, it's important to point out profit isn't the endgame. Stock price is more important, and the more sales each outfit has, the higher the price generally. It has a multiplier effect on the CEO's investible capital. So even though they might have low margins, the future profit of a company like Amazon's will add to the stock price, and therefore immediate net worth of Bezos.
* "Yeah, so if us as individuals did what I recommended above, there would be an order of magnitude more good stuff happening, too bad we can't really rely on most people to do it. Looking at it both from a single-transaction level or in total, what I said above does more good for the world."
If there is a big discrepancy in price in every case, then yes I'd agree. Otherwise, buy (vote) your conscience. But which brand of potato chips a person buys isn't going to change the world. The profit is too low. But which computer they do, might. If that money is put into the hands of a future-minded CEO who knows how to invest.
* "People don't seem to care much."
Intel, largest chipmaker in the world, announced this week they no longer source from the DR Congo, so it's reasonable to say that people do care, and  are taking active steps to remedy the wrong. [Source] (

Yes, I looked at it but it just takes you to a webform that is sent to your local dealership with a pre negotiated price. No bitcoin checkout there as it seems they are just an affiliate for the dealerships.

Then go to bitcointalk
@_date: 2014-01-10 01:28:37
That is the prevailing opinion. But look what happens when you scale it up.
Microsoft's profits have created the most charitable organization in the world by dollars spent. Apple has done nothing remotely similar. Everyone who bought MSFT indirectly helped out humanity in a large way. Similarly, the technomillionaries like Musk, Bezos are investing in the future while Apple stares at a pile of cash.
If it was discovered that LG was somehow funding terrorism, but had the cheapest smartphone price, would you still buy from them? Then give the money you had saved to UNICEF? Probably not.
Price is not the only consideration to make.
It doesn't seem to make a big difference if you just look at it 1 transaction at a time, but over time and many more transactions, the money adds up and can do powerful things.
@_date: 2014-02-19 05:32:18
Multi-sig (2) with you owning both signatures.
Signature one is you signing the bitcoins to another address. Signature two is a bot that waits for the balance to change in your address. Once it notices a change, it signs it's private key which publishes your Tx to move all bitcoins from address that was just hacked.
As someone else just said, this isn't how bitcoin protocol works currently and wouldn't help if you were hacked.

Haha no no no. They are in a corner. They rely, and have been relying on fees for much of their business. It's practically their entire business model. If they are forced to take a cut that deep, it will sink them.

Then send like .25btc to a throwaway wallet from coinbase, and then spend everything in the throwaway wallet on bitcointip. (ideally pretty quickly)
Coinbase is good for security but bad for micromanaging your money. So, a double edged sword basically.

@_date: 2013-12-09 20:58:45
Yes I didn't say they aren't profitable. They still are, yes. However they cannot just "reduce" their fees in order to compete with bitcoin because they would have to bring them down so low, it would end most of their profits they've been able to make all along by having the biggest game in town since forever.

Bitcoin is the currency of the Internet: a distributed, worldwide, decentralized digital money. Unlike traditional currencies such as dollars, bitcoins are issued and managed without any central authority whatsoever: there is no government, company, or bank in charge of Bitcoin. As such, it is more resistant to wild inflation and corrupt banks. With Bitcoin, you can be your own bank.

This is to say that you have already decided to spend money on that Subway sandwich anyways. You could hand them dollars. Or...you could pay them with bitcoin, and then immediately use the dollars you would have otherwise paid with, to replace the bitcoin you just used to buy a sub.
If the merchant (Subway) is pricing his subs at the live market price of BTC/USD, and you immediately replace your spent bitcoins by buying the same amount you just used to buy a sub, then it's the same "price" to you in dollars, you will never lose purchasing power. Minus Coinbase's fee.
I really hope Coinbase adds this feature. I will certainly use it.
