What do you mean? It says for all sellers that you meet in person that they will just go for the current marketcap price. You're meeting them in person so you don't need to give them extra money or delivery or something.

I'm still a bit lost as to what you mean. The guy I'm getting from is on localbitcoin. He isn't using localbitcoins online exchange. He's transferring from his own wallet. The cash amount will be determined by the price on coinmarketcap.com when I meet him in person. There is not going to be extra transact fee as it's essentially like meeting someone on craigslist. Just a lot more safe.
I understand the huge exchange rate difference if I wasn't meeting him, but he advised me it will be going off coinmarketcap.com as I assumed.

I mean I know I can open it but its like random letters and numbers. Looks sort of like addresses but it isn't.

Thanks for telling me I'm wrong, but more thanks to u/5tu for explaining why I'm wrong.

Is this just translated poorly? No one can be this incompetent. Forget about not ever hearing about bitcoin. When you're writing article about a terrorist group wanting something specific; at least read 1 line about the specific thing they are wanting.

I will definitely look into but why would coinbase split their userbase to 2 different sites?

Yea you're right. Turns out there is a page on blockchain site that allows you to directly upload that type of file, annnd it's encrypted with a password I can't remember. I think it might be saved on one of my old pcs but I can't be bothered looking for it if it's just a small amount. I know there probably isn't a way but can I check how much is in that wallet with the backup. If it's a substantial amount then I can justify spending a day to sift through all my old hard drives so I can send that amount to my current wallet.
