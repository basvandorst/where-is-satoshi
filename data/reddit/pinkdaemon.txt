somewhat fitting argument, but that isn't the topic.

Coindesk is just its owner trying to build opinions. Their pieces are always very subjective and have a certain tone to them. As far as crypto "journalism" is comcerned there's almost no sites that don't host a personal agenda.

For me it was my soul. And a healthy looking skin color.

haha, the vertcoin downvote army has arrived. nice to see you guys stick together like that :)
you boast about fair and equal and shit and your reply is exactly why you guys do. you wanna be an elitist club that only a few have access to.
asics are the most fair and equal solution for anyone. what's the difference between a guy with 10000mh in gpus or 10000mh in asics? please enlighten me as to why a person needs to spend 350 bucks on a gpu and 100 bucks on electricity every month instead of less for hardware and way less for running it?

Would also fuck?

haha. you actually took the time to dig up this thread and reply. and your reply just completely proves my point.
well i'm happy for you if things are going well. wish you all the best :)

don't follow jebus911. he's an arrogant prick with the behavior of a 12 year old.
the rest might be right, but op should learn how to use a spell check.

lol, I downvoted your obvious vertcoin propaganda but I upvote this one ;)
@_date: 2014-04-24 22:25:24
So if merchant x doesn't deliver my gpus and meanwhile the vtc diff rockets vertcoin will magically reimburse me?

Myriad upvote brigade just arrived.
But seriously people, if you care about bitcoin the technology, then all is fine. If you care about nakamoto's vision of a decentralized currency for everyone then myriad is our best bet.

well I for one would happily donate my hashing power to a freemybtc coin. if something like that were possible..

Imagine a chinese sweat shop scratching scratch offs at this rate.
@_date: 2014-06-08 08:50:18
Sounds like a coin targeting the gangster rap community..

Signed up, tried doing some of the bounties and it kept throwing me back to the signup page.. :(
