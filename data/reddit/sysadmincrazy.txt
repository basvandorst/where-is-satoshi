Literally the guy is not on this earth anymore so those coins will never move.

How is it maintaining the original vision with block sizes past the nominal limit?

Whats the problem, you know bitcoin is the one true crypto, buy cheap and wait, simple. The network wont fall apart and all those miners we bought will come in useful again.
Iv been in this since 2011, the whole fear factor keeps coming back again and I no longer understand why.
Bitcoin has proven itself time and again, need I remind that its not been hacked yet as it is unhackable. Unlike ether (the main thing ether has is that its a private company technically so closed source developers prefer that because PATENTS!, but proof of stake rather than proof of work is a concept that I just dont get, I seriously dont know how they expect miners to stay onboard for transaction fees only)
Ideologies aside, only bitcoin is getting the real market test and capital investment. BCH was 200 dollars 5 days ago, and will probably be 200 dollar after the next sell off, they refer to BCH as divedends to the average investor and thats probably the best way to put it.
Satoshi built a reliable workhorse, i will only follow the main chain but at the same time no one should be fucking with his formula, he thought of all of the angles.

Tor nodes because they are so technologically adapt

The internet did revolutionise the economy, the world economy, it made the economy and capitalism incredibly more efficient at the cost of human labour, in my eyes this is no bad thing as I value automation.
The world does not owe anyone a living and in sure people in China who were once making pottery/ growing rice but now build roads and skyscrapers have a different view point to you in the state of the world economy.

Do you not change back to fiat for purchasing, be it stock or whatever? If not how do you manage not using fiat?

The markets will decide and go with the winner, look at snap, facebook, ello, google hangouts, google+ and finally myspace. 
There is only ever one true winner, the rest are just copies and it takes time to realize that, so whilst I agree with you for now. Give it 10 years and that wont be the case. 
10 years from now I expect only bitcoin and/or ethereum to be around.

Im happy to agree to disagree, the definition of economy that I base on is too economise our society, to make our society more efficient in all aspects, the weakest links get removed to do this but they always have done (i.e look at horses with the rise of the car, they couldn't keep up so were removed from the economy) it's just a shame this time round out at low skilled workers are in the firing line as we shift into a machine automated economy.

Thanks for coming back to me, you helped me decide.

The one with the BTC / Bitcoin ticker is the real one.

Tbh its kinda pathetic they even need to come up with a sabotage plan.
@_date: 2017-08-22 20:22:45
Iv been thinking about this comment over the last few days and BCH. Do you have any evidence to back up what you say so I can do some further research.
This segwit2x is a mess and im slowly being convinced. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 23:36:24
exactly, at one time a $20 swing meant insane profits/losses!
@_date: 2017-08-28 07:53:33
Don't understand why your getting shit for this post. It's true what you say but maybe they are more emotionally involved as they bought coins at a way inflated price compared to us?
@_date: 2017-08-18 23:33:42
Yeah my mom and dad are really aware of the fork...
@_date: 2018-06-28 22:41:31
You're right.

Sounds like a bus

Awesome you know what. I didn't even watch the whole thing first time around. I thought it was a real post and he was showing off his new car and I was commenting on how bad it sounded thinking it was a heavy diesel engine.

Have a look at getting an Estonia e residency, it enables UK citizens to operate businesses in Estonia remotely and use their banks. They are very forward thinking when it comes to tech so are probably crypto friendly

Thanks I missed that one
@_date: 2018-12-07 20:24:34
Warren buffet said that himself and it's absolutely correct. 
Listen guys, alts will die off but bitcoin will be sound in the long term

I did but the link I was provided with above I didn't read, which is what I am doing now
