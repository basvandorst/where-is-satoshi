Ahh that sucks! I just started using Electrum but I think if you right click on the transaction (under the "History" tab) there is an option to modify the miners fee.
Take that with a grain of salt though, that may only work before the transaction gets verified.

"Acceleration succeeded"
I thought you could adjust the miner fee with Electrum, or is that only before the transaction becomes verified? 
I always set mine at the highest fee to get quick confirmations because I'm impatient af.

I got your first transaction to go through using the accelerator :)
 confirmations now
EDIT: What wallet are you using to send the payments? Mycelium or Breadwallet?
@_date: 2017-03-31 20:24:26
You're finally at 2 confs :)
@_date: 2017-03-31 19:32:27
I ran your tx id through the accelerator a few times so it should have confirmations any time now.

Legit as it gets. 
They offer a bitcoin debit card which is pretty sweet, instantly transfer your btc into spendable money on a BitPay visa card.

It's rising quick af, ^ $30 in the past ~20 mins

Both were sent with a 28 cent transaction fee so I could see it taking a few hours but 12+ hours is a lil outta hand.
I put the first transaction through the tx accelerator and it worked but it said the second tx id doesn't exist which is weird.
If you're able to change the network fee I always use at least 40 cents and have never had a problem with confirmations.

IMHO Breadwallet is one of the best for iOS.
If you really want a different wallet try BitPay. You can also get a bitcoin debit card through them if you wish.

As far as I know, yes.
@_date: 2017-05-17 18:46:56
Right. That pop up is annoying af however the txaccelerator has worked every time I've used it in the past.
Idk why someone would downvote my post when all I was tryna do is help but whatever lol

If you're that worried about 1-2$ then yes you could go that route. 
I don't usually pay attention to how much the fee is, I don't send/receive enough to worry about a couple dollars.
@_date: 2017-05-17 19:51:47
I already do. I bought in @ $21 a lil while ago.
I still use BTC occasionally to cash out with the BitPay debit card though.

Oh, I see why it got downvoted.. I wasn't aware of any of that tbh. 
Thanks for the heads up.
