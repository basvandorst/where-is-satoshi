You get detailed sales reports, an instant payment notification (IPN) service for direct payments to your Bitcoin address and various integration options. We're currently working on code to integrate with popular e-commerce platforms and shopping carts.
We will be updating the help pages over the next few days with more information about the merchant services. In the meantime, we'll be happy to answer any questions that you may have.
Stay tuned.

We built [BitDrive]( which provides an Instant Payment Notification (IPN) service when you receive a payment. All you need to set up an account is an email address, any name and a URL (we do not require identity or business verification).

We've updated our Help Centre with some information which you can find at 
The documentation is still a work in progress.
We've reduced the one-time fee to 3 BTC as an introductory/promotional phase to get users onboard.
Hope this helps.

This is great.
I was able to successfully deposit into my account using Bitcoin, and it appears they also offer virtual cards, which can be very useful.
Practically instant Bitcoin to USD conversion.

Design is hard for non-designers.
We built a Bitcoin wallet for Android (still evaluating plans iOS and Windows Phone ports) called Bitdash which you can find at 
We're also working on a web wallet with a focus on ease-of-use, and we believe it's a fairly decent attempt at good UX.
