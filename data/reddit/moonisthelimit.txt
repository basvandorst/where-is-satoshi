I personally think that he hasn't moved them because he didn't want it to look like some ponzi get rich quick scheme and by keeping them together and not spending them or shifting them around, it shows solidarity and belief in bitcoin and the blockchain. 
I also believe that he will some day come out and show who he is once the world fully accepts bitcoin or the blockchain....or am I thinking too much into this? DOH! There I go again thinking too deep into things.
Either that or he/she/they/it are dead/gone/forgot all about it!

I think that's a very good point. A lot of merchants will just transfer BTC back into fiat. A friend of mines that is interested in bitcoin wants 1 bitcoin from his parents for Christmas. I tried to explain the fact that he doesn't need to go and buy a full bitcoin but could buy some 'satoshi' and build it up to a bitcoin over time. I think some people don't understand that you can buy less than a bitcoin. I think bitcoin will rocket in the coming years but I can't see it rocketing anytime soon unfortunately. I have 2.8 BTC and I look at the bright side that the coins are cheap and the more I buy now the better it will be for my future. I think any fiat that I get for Christmas will be converted straight into bitcoin. I live in Scotland and there are very few merchants that accept bitcoin. In time I know that will change.

Yeah I'd like to know this as well. 
@_date: 2016-01-08 10:03:31
annnnnd we're back in the room!
@_date: 2015-01-10 20:24:15
Do you know when this will happen? And why? (bit of a newbie with the technical stuff)
@_date: 2015-01-14 19:57:45
The other exchanges are around the same price though. Maybe the crash being triggered on bitstamp has other traders looking on and the same patterns are repeating on the other exchanges? Who knows?

I have SCOT coins (which is an altcoin) but tbh I don't have much hope for them. Bitcoin on the other hand I have massive hope for. I don't really know why there are altcoins around either so I'd like to know what the point of them are as well. The SCOT coins I got for free so I'm not going to reject that. 
@_date: 2016-01-20 21:52:07
Thanks for the information. Appreciate it :)
@_date: 2016-01-15 13:02:20
So it's not all doom and gloom by sounds of that Mike guy. Cheers for the link!
@_date: 2016-01-15 13:05:36
When you say 'increasing number of transactions per second will further increase pressure to centralize' why would that put pressure to centralize it? 
@_date: 2016-01-15 12:03:59
I don't understand much of the technical jargon but to me if the blockchain is under stress because it can't handle many more transactions, then why don't they just change it up and allow more transactions? Will this have an impact serious enough to cause any problems? I really am confused. 
If a business is under stress then it looks at it's processes. If it needs more staff, it employs more staff, if it needs the right tools then it buys the right tools. If the blockchain can't handle x amount of transactions per minute then surely you change it??????? 
Someone explain why the folk in charge here, and the people debating this, won't change things up? This has been frying my brain for a while now but after this Mike guy gave up it seems like it has caused a huge fuss. Just looking for some explanations here. Cheers in advance.
@_date: 2016-01-15 13:34:01
Thanks for the explanation. This is a pretty big deal which is actually worrying. In general would you say that the bitcoin community is confident of a solution to these problems?
@_date: 2016-01-15 13:29:32
AH! That's what I'm looking for! Thanks for explaining that. Makes sense.
@_date: 2016-01-08 13:49:11
haha I said 2/3 as in 2 or 3 places. I wish it was 2/3rds! I would then put an end to all my fiat probably.
@_date: 2016-01-20 16:58:41
Thanks rosberg2014. 
So that makes sense but the thing that doesn't make sense is why would people be buying more Bitcoins to have 2 for 1? It doesn't make sense. Theoretically yes you could have coins on both forks but that doesn't double your value of coins from say 10 coins to 20 coins does it? So correct me if I'm wrong but does this title of this article seem misleading? Thanks again
@_date: 2016-01-20 15:32:37
Just out of curiosity....what does this actually mean? How can you double up your coins if there is only going to be 21 million Bitcoins.....I know this has something to do with the 'fork' talk? And the whole Bitcoin debate from 1MB to 2MB etc. Anyone clarify what this means to someone who needs a little explanation? Thank you please! :D
@_date: 2016-01-16 12:24:51
HODL BILL!
@_date: 2016-01-08 12:30:01
Well we know what it brings to the table and is hardly used anywhere but having altcoins which are worth...well nothing really apart from a couple other altcoins. Bitcoin was the first so I can see why people flock to that. I personally see Bitcoin more as an investment like gold but that's only because I don't have many places I can exchange all my FIAT for Bitcoin so that I can buy general stuff with Bitcoin. Literally around 2/3 places where I live accept Bitcoin and I don't even use these places. 
@_date: 2015-08-21 14:22:07
Yeah I used the wrong wording completely. User friendly sounds better and less offensive. I think I wrote that because I was referring to another article about people being too stupid to use Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-09-10 19:32:10
I have like a million or so Scotcoins. If 'ScotPound' takes off then it looks like my Scotcoins will be doomed!
@_date: 2015-11-13 10:38:36
That's great advice. Really appreciate it and I'll look into that for sure. :)
@_date: 2015-11-12 17:41:46
You know what? I might actually be reading something really old. I clicked on the first couple of links from Google and then thought I'd speak to the community instead to get their thoughts. 
Presuming it's pretty much pointless if you were to do it on your own?
@_date: 2015-10-29 16:40:49
Do you reject FIAT and all of it's temptations!?
@_date: 2015-11-12 09:55:10
So when I read about certain mining equipment costing around $6000, saying that it mines around 1 bitcoin a day, is that just sales bull crap? 
If electricity wasn't a problem and you paid around $6000 then from what I am aware it would take you less than a month to get your money back wouldn't it? 
@_date: 2015-10-29 15:59:30
These thoughts.......these....thoughts.......Make me feel funny inside!
@_date: 2015-11-12 20:49:33
That's really great information so I thank you for that :)
I might consider buying a cheaper miner like the one you suggested but I could always talk to the guys who sell the miners closer to a time when/if I go ahead. Would you recommend any guys in particular who sell the equipment?
@_date: 2015-10-29 21:29:37
Ok so if the market cap of bitcoin is around $4 Billion then that is an 1/8th of the market cap traded in one day. Just out of curiosity does anyone know what kind of money is traded each day on the biggest non crypto exchanges?
