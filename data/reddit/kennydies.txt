Is... is that a signature on reddit?

Nope. Gonna plug it into my PC with a boot CD on it. Hopefully to recover some serious cash.

UPDATE! I think I found the hard drive. But it's in bad condition. I think I may have ran a magnet over it quite a bit though...
Any suggestions? If I can get the wallet off of the hard drive I'll give 7.5 BTC (or split 7.5) to the person(s) who helped recover it.

I'll search for the hard drive in my garage but I doubt I still have it. My father is a neat freak and I'm a pack rat, sometimes my overflow lands in there only to be buried or thrown out. Maybe I'll be lucky but I'm not one for false hope.

At the end of the day, that's what keeps me sane. I probably would have seen $200 and sold then, thinking that was the peak. Maybe even less. Who knows? Not me, apparently, ha.

I'll look into it. If I recall correctly, Falcon Force's UBCD has EaseUS on it.

On the bright side, you got some decent hardware out of it. Donate some processing power to SETI if you can.
And if nothing else, I learned a lot from Bitcoin, especially how markets work. I'm hoping to see Bitcoin get even bigger and maybe the $8 I spent on Bitcoin the other week will introduce me to more things money related.

The hard drive was totally fine but, I guess you could say I'm a bit paranoid, I like reinstalling Windows every once in a while, just to stay on the safe side. Backed up all my docs, pictures, etc. But forgot the bitcoin wallet. Damn shame, really. I could have paid off my student loans with that money.
@_date: 2013-11-26 23:59:47
Stupid? Yes. A lot has changed since 2009ish.

I invested early and mined on a crappy, pre-built PC, gathered around 75+ BTC. 
Turns out I forgot about the 75 BTC while wiping the hard drive later that year and, well, let's just say theres not a single day I don't regret it.
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:33:58
I just bought 0.01 BTC the other week for $7.98 (after fees and such) and now, at ~$925, I've already made $1.25!
Now to make $74,998.75 more, lol.

Found the hard drive. A cut (7.5 BTC) is up for grabs if I can recover it. It'll be a challenge though.

This was years ago on a computer that is no longer with us. After the unfortunate events, I kind of gave up with Bitcoin until late last year.
All in all though, I'm still happy. Bitcoin is gaining real traction now and many a person are having their lives improved. I know, had I had the money, it probably would have been ill-spent and that, however unlikely, it was probably for the better. Who knows.
I try and stay humble but it really does bring a tear to my eye knowing that I could have improved mine and my fathers life significantly had I not been so careless.

A magnet, a very powerful one at that.
