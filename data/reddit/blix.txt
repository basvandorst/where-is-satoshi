But does dogecoin scale. That's the problem.

Neoliberals tend to support central banking and a government controlled, target inflation rate of 1-3%

So do you think the price of bitcoin will ever stabilize?
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:40:56


This is the most retarded thing I've ever read.

Bitcoin is deflationary. It will always go up, and it will never stabilize and thus it will never be a currency
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:07:18
Bitcoin has a fixed supply. If people choose to use it as a currency, that means people have to buy it, which causes prices to increase. But because it causes the price to increase, no one will want to use it as a currency, they'll just treat it as an investment. But if it's not a currency, then why would people want it in the first place? Store of value? Maybe. But if it's a store of value, then it will never be a currency. 
Deflationary currencies will never be used as currency.

That's how bias is formed. Everyone should listen to a diverse set of view points and come to an informed decision

My guess is this is the result of the SEC having to make a lot of their records public lol
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:02:55
The better question is, what are they jumping to?
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:43:04
Deflationary currency will never be practical. No one wants to buy a million dollar pizza.
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:00:48
Do you pay capital gains tax when the dollar appreciates?
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:55:45
How do you know if you don't watch him?
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:49:51
No you don't understand.
Someone literally bought a pizza for $50 million dollars. Back when bitcoin were a few cents each, someone paid 10k bitcoins for a pizza. No one will ever make that same mistake again. No one will spend a deflationary currency. No one wants to buy a million dollar pizza.

Anyone who spends a deflationary currency is really dumb. No one wants to buy a billion dollar pizza

If all the works money was instantly put into bitcoin, bitcoin still would never stabilize because it's deflationary. Wealth will be growing, while the currency supply will not be, and so it will always be increasing
@_date: 2017-12-02 14:59:25
Ethereum is the only coin that has a chance of stabilizing because it's not deflationary

Hey I can strawman too! Lets let government manage our food supply! We'll all have free food, because there's definitely no way a government would ever fuck that up!
But seriously, stop trying to shoehorn the internet into a utility. It's not. There are multiple competitive ISPs that anyone can choose from in the US. LAst time I checked, you can choose your water supply or who you get your roads from.

I wish he would have actually explained why he likes the side chain solution. He went in depth with why scaling the block size alone isn't enough, but didn't talk about side chains at all. All he did was say pretty words, and mention the lightning network in the same sentence.... He kept saying "but we have to do it the right way" but didn't actually explain what the right way was or why it was right or why it would work. The last half of the video was pure fluff imo.
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:23:00
Ok? That doesn't mean anything to me.
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:03:34
That was a pretty dumb thread tbh. People who know a lot about money are taKing an interest in the future of money. So what? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:35:22
The whole point of bitcoin was to get away from government monopoly money...

Seriously. I use both subs, because I don't understand the technologies all that well and I just want to stay up to date on current events. Both sides are very passionate, and a false flag attack this blatant wouldn't surprise me. But it's impossible to know either way.
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:58:10
Because maybe they're right? Who knows? I don't. Both sides have interesting arguments.
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:07:43
Almost too obvious
