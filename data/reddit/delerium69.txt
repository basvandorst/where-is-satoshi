I think at this stage, creditor rallying to ask the Japanese courts to reverse their decision on cancelling rehabilitation is the first step. This then opens the doors to any potential investor again.
Lets be honest here, even if you don't like MtGox and don't want to use it as a company, do you still want as much of your money back as possible? If so then this is the right thing to do!

its a complete fau par on my part really. I was signed into my pc on my iPhone and in a rush to post something before the 3G dropped again and it should have read "BTC deposits re-enabled. Outage completion on track for 3:15".

Actually yes... and from what I was told, things were fine :( I have no involvement in any buy out. I'm actually of the opinion that there should be a push to simply allow rehabilitation attempts in general, not necessarily the 1BTC bid at all.
People do forget that there is already a solid framework in place there, trained staff, AML registered customers - all ripe for the taking...... 
 - appreciate that but the creditors that gox have now stand to only get ~5% ish from the liquidation so its massively in their interest to attempt to get more if possible. 
 - why do i care? I'm a creditor too :(

Yes, I'd assumed where you'd have a buy, you'd have a sell near instantly but that won't always be the case. So there is that. The net affect over a long time would be zero tho surley?
@_date: 2014-07-17 11:10:01
I'd like that to be a possibility but can the bitcoin blockchain really support the amount of transactions we are talking about loading into it? It can't now but is it possible that the protocol can be developed with the answer to this million dollar question?

Hang on so you are saying that you sold your Bitcoin on MtGox and then requested a fiat withdrawal that was never processed? Join the queue of thousands of customers that had the same issue. The only queues that were moving in a decent pace were EUR and JPY withdrawals because they were with banks that weren't causing transfer issues.

ask if raiffeisenbank is linked with citigroup in any way. If it is, then there is your answer. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 15:47:13
Q.7 But I actually obtained this data from Delerium’s website who is a gox employee / contractor / associate.
• I will have to look into that.
Due to the number of transactions the website had to obtain information from each 30 mins from bitcoind, its quite possible the data isnt accurate hence why i eventually took it offline.
The process that compiled the data was taking longer than the refresh routine was scheduled for in the crontab so its ended up being garbled. Everything was working though up to ~2/3 days ago.
@_date: 2014-07-17 11:06:55
there would be no acceptable indicator that you could apply to say a bitcoin is 'lost'. Someone may simply have them in cold storage saving for a rainy day.

you'd need to post the context of this comment for it to mean something.

You did, I apologise.

Which was the information given to everyone in support from the management team.
Edit: ... and also why I too lost a fortune in the bankrupcy :(
@_date: 2014-07-17 10:28:22
"Growing public interest, network effect (upward pressure)"- would this more be bubble effect rather than long term though - ie. people wanting to try and get in on the wild % gains that bitcoin has historically shown?
@_date: 2014-09-06 09:37:05
I don't mind sharing. 35k EUR Lost. I personally always had another contract during the day with a UK company - i only joined MtGox to try and improve their support processes (and there was a lot of really good processes being worked on just before the closure). 
My wife, however, this was her permanent job/contract. She has a disabling illness that means she cannot work a normal job. The MtGox support role was so flexible that whenever she became ill, she could work the hours another time. She is still out of work.
@_date: 2014-02-24 12:38:37
Actually i mentioned this to the support management last week about it not being fit for purpose. Looks like they've listened. 
Our service desk system was linked directly to twitter meaning that anytime anyone tweeted us, it created a ticket and was responded to via twitter when we resolve the cases. 
@_date: 2014-09-05 13:36:42
I was a contracted support consultant yes. My wife (SarahCoinBit) also worked as contracted support. 
@_date: 2014-09-05 09:09:06
I assume its related to these posts:
and the funds received back are where customers were unable to withdraw their balances from OKPay when they stopped allowing them.
I'm assuming its in the 'others' section on the document on mtgox:

Can someone please screenshot the article so those who dont have subscriptin can read it?
@_date: 2014-07-17 10:52:38
Not convinced we can make that assumption. Don't get me wrong, i love bitcoin but i'm trying to stay on the fence in terms of this discussion to try and understand how we will look long term.
If we all decided we were going to not use our countries fiats, then yes, i can certainly see the value of bitcoin exponentially increase but is this really a reality? Can the blockchain realistically cope with the millions of transactions that todays world will throw at it.... 
@_date: 2014-08-12 18:45:17
Indeed - and it does make you think.... how safe is your money in a bank....
@_date: 2014-07-17 10:03:19
sure but this doesnt account for where people are converting from cash to bitcoin. Cash/Debit Card to Merchant will be far cheaper than than Cash/Debit Card -&gt; Bitcoin -&gt; Merchant.

Update: now its on the blockchain - panic over.
@_date: 2014-02-24 12:55:20
To add to the convo - look at the actual question that was askedby Datavetaren:
[12:19] &lt;Datavetaren&gt;  How many core developers do you got?
[12:20] &lt; Datavetaren: I don't know the exact number sorry, they are in Japan and i'm in the UK
Why would support staff need to know how many developers we have at that time. We know there is a team, thats all we need to know.
@_date: 2014-03-10 19:24:49

@_date: 2014-07-17 11:27:16
One thing that a colleague has just mentioned is inflation. Bitcoin is immune to inflation (well currently not because new coins are created but once all are created, it can no longer be diluted). This effect would potentially mean that the value of BTC would always be rising vs Fiat.
@_date: 2014-08-12 18:43:08
I think we all needed to a little. Was too much of a holy grail and caused a lot of delusion in many of us. As most of you know, i was contracting for mtgox support at the time and had no idea either. My company had approx 35k EUR invested at the time of bankrupcy :(
A lesson well learnt - still doesn't help soothe the sting though.
@_date: 2014-02-02 22:34:55
I thought this too - the issue you have is will the government honor the donation gift aid element when we use bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-10-28 18:07:41
It was the banks, you're just using the theft as a convenient excuse to say that there was no money to start with and you were fraudulently treated by the company which is not the case at all. Sure there has been some sort of activity - of what we're not sure yet that has ended up in the loss of nearly the entire cold wallet storage and some fiat funds.....
International wires were close to standstill. There was a tiny number of wires allowed to process each day for withdrawals. the queue was huge :( Also didn't help that american banks (especially correspondant banks) like to reject any transactions to do with MtGox.
In summary you were not alone. There were 1000's affected by this. 
Withdrawals in JPY or in EUR queue's were moving - but even EUR were approx 4-5 week delay in withdrawals.

Thanks for the responses guys - I think my understanding of mining just got upgraded so thanks for that. Interesting idea from about looking at the median of X number of previous blocks. If this is done over a decent number of blocks then this could ensure consistency in mined blocks sizes?
@_date: 2017-09-18 23:10:28
pretty sure the protocol wasn't meant to be designed in a way so that  doing less actually earns more. I'm not suggesting we make it unprofitable for miners at all merely reward them more for reducing delays by confirming as much as possible when the network has a bigger mempool.
@_date: 2017-09-19 16:10:19
So why aren't miners filling up blocks - if its no extra time for them to confirm these. Dare i say we have cartel agreements between them to keep the transaction count in the mempool high for their own gain?
@_date: 2017-09-19 10:09:54

99% of the time the rebroadcasts will fail. MtGox also try rebroadcasting as well.
