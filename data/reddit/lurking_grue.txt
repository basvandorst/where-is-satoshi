"But, you see, once you have made it, a penny keeps on being a penny," said Mr Bent. "That"s the magic of it."
"It is?" said Moist. "Look, it"s a copper disc. What do you expect it to become?"
"In the course of a year, just about everything," said Mr Bent smoothly. "It becomes some apples, part of a cart, a pair of shoelaces, some hay, an hour"s occupancy of a theatre seat. It may even become a stamp and send a letter, Mr Lipwig. It might be spent three hundred times and yet — and this is the good part — it is still one penny, ready and willing to be spent again. It is not an apple, which will go bad. Its worth is fixed and stable. It is not consumed."
Mr Bent"s eyes gleamed dangerously, and one of them twitched. "And this is because it is ultimately worth a tiny fraction of the everlasting gold!"
"But it"s just a lump of metal. If we used apples instead of coins, you could at least eat the apple," said Moist.
"Yes, but you can only eat it once. A penny is, as it were, an everlasting apple."
"Which you can"t eat. And you can plant an apple tree."
"You can use money to make more money," said Bent.
"Yes, but how do you make more gold? The alchemists can"t, the dwarfs hang on to what they"ve got, the Agateans won"t let us have any. Why not go on the silver standard? They do that in BhangBhangduc."
"I imagine they would, being foreign," said Bent. "But silver blackens. Gold is the one untarnishable metal." And once again there was that tic: gold clearly had a tight hold on the man. "Have you seen enough, Mr Lipwig?"
"Slightly too much for comfort, I think."
"Then let us go and meet the chairman."

I'm not the person you were originally talking to.    
There is a lot of misinformation about what net neutrality is about and it isn't end users using too much bandwidth they are not paying enough for.
This is more an issue of the back-end agreements about peering data.   Peering is a weird part of internet plumbing that people just don't know enough about.
I am not saying government regulation is a great solution but there is more to it than most people think. 
I suggest reading more technical reports about this and not just libertarian talk show hosts.

Perhaps this quote is more appropriate:
5 . Monetary Units: None.
In fact there are three  freely  convertible  currencies  in  the Galaxy,  but none of them count. 
The Altairan Dollar has recently collapsed, the Flaninian Pobble Bead  is  only  exchangeable  for other  
Flaninian  Pobble  Beads,  and the Triganic Pu has its own very special problems. 
It's exchange rate of eight Ningis  to  one Pu  is  simple  enough,  but since a Ningi is a triangular 
rubber coin six thousand eight hundred miles across each  side,  no  one has  ever  collected  enough  
to  own  one  Pu.  Ningis  are  not negotiable currency because the Galactibanks refuse  to  deal  in 
fiddling  small change. 
From this basic premise it is very simple to prove that the Galactibanks are also the 
product of a deranged imagination.

Every transaction is known and you better believe there is somebody out there collecting it all.   
All that has to be done is find the connections to SOME people and the others will be eventually inferred.   We've seen this many times over the years in other technologies.   It's all in the combinations of metadata and the transactions. Yes, you can be anonymous using it but only if you are seriously careful.
I can't wait for the articles in a few years when a researcher claims he can find anybody given a few bitcoin transactions.
Like this sort of thing:
Are YOU using bitcoin on your android phone?
I'm not saying Bitcoin is bad but don't fool yourself otherwise you might have a rude awaking in a few years.   Remember this Trueism:  "Attacks on a system always get better in time, they never get worse."
