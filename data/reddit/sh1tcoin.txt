of course these two are in with the Ripple crowd.
my guess is that eventually Bitcoin will be revealed to be a complete fraud, at which point Ripple will be viewed as the replacement technology.  Big banks win!
Bitcoin is a flawed concept and unfortunately it's downfall will be seen as a problem with ALL digital currencies.  Prior to bitcoin banks and world governments were very concerned about digital currenceis and the threat they posed.  Now when the Bitcoin story is over, and we get loads of new laws and regulations, they will cease to be a threat.

if you can't see what a stupid comical fraud the Winklevoss twins are you are seriously dumb.

apparently his name is not even Josh, so when he's ready to move onto his next con- he can drop the 'Josh' part.

Hi I'm daryl and this is my other brother daryl.  We LOVE BITCOINS.  We might have even invented them.  We also have a chiseled appearance and excellent bone structure.
WE LOVE REGULATIONS!
how dumb is the bitcoin community?

the simple fact is the story we got from the Facebook movie is a KNOWN FRAUD.  The real story invovles US Intel and the types of characters that Edward Snowden hangs with.
**So lets think through this shall we?**
We know the Facebook Movie is a complete fraud designed to cement a particular story line into the public memory(who the !@ makes a movie about a company that was formed only a few years ago?).
These two laughable twin characters[1] suddenly appear, legitimized by a story plot we know to be fraudulent, claim to have been in bitcoin 'all along', then start steering the community of bitfaggots like yourself who have no testicles of their own, and then start making statements to the tune of 'REGULATIONS ARE GOOD GUISE!  LISTEN TO US!'.  How utterly stupid are the 'bitcoin community?  These two twins are obviously insiders that much is clear.
of course we see the story reiterated by dependable media outlets such as CNBC.
I'm starting to see that the 'bitcion community' is really just a bunch of clueless techie faggots with no life and almost no money.
Did you know that Mt. GOX originally stood for 'Magic The Gathering Online Exchange'?
[1] twins are also considered a valuable commodity in Intel circles for obvious reasons.

that's precisely right.  The rich are concerned everyone will have access to their special privilege.

wth does that mean?

**Winklevoss Twins?**  could the bitcoin scene get any lamer?  At first I thought it was strange that' people like Maximo aka 'Josh Rossi' were suddenly overnight 'experts' in Bitcoin, now these two clowns.  Dude wth is going on here?
@_date: 2013-06-25 18:28:38
people are going to be so sorry that they ever listened to these bitcoin people.  Bitcoin people are:
1) clueless losers
2) criminals
3) tax evaders
4) greedy

LOL.  Why would a **legitimate business** want to accept bitcion?
@_date: 2013-06-15 13:10:38
maybe he sounds like a silly kid because he **is** a silly kid?
@_date: 2013-06-14 19:58:09
I gotta say, at least they gave this Josh Rossi character accurate treatment.  They guy walks around these circles like some kind of spoiled brat in need of attention.  He comes off like some cheap strip bar promoter who just got out of jail. Thankfully this article didn't give him the legitimacy he beleives he has.

go look at the 'LEADERS' of these various bitcoin groups.
clueless, uneducated freaks.  Just go to the bitcoin NYC meetup.  You'll get the idea pretty quick what these people are about.  Dimwitted asses with half-baked ideas who think they're important, that and criminal con-men.
@_date: 2013-06-30 19:32:20
who really cares about this sleaze pit?
@_date: 2013-06-16 14:40:01
that's a sign they are **bullshit artists not good businessmen**.
what do these two clowns know about bitcoin?  where did they come from?  why are they associated with another [known scam and fraud] (  We know the FB story is fake- so what's their story?
@_date: 2013-06-15 15:24:32
seriously, can no one figure this out?
