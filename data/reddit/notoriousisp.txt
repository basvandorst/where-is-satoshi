It's on me to sell at what I feel is a fair price. If you can sell it better, that's up to you. 
It's the same as people antique shopping or looking for good deals at garage sales. Should they be required to say "hey, did you know I could sell this for $50 on eBay and you only want a dollar?" No. They buy it for the $1 and go sell themselves. 
The onus is on the seller to know they can get a better deal.

Like I said, I think selling things with insider knowledge is bad, but buying is not.

What damage? Plenty of people don't think insider trading should be a crime. 
I agree with this when your trades are buying a security or commodity with knowledge, but not for selling it. 
When you buy it, the person you buy from is satisfied with the price they sold it to you at, and are not being deceived out of future gains. If you didn't buy it at that price, someone else would have. 
If you sell something you are cheating the person you are selling it to because you are offloading an asset you know has a lower value.

But Coinbase banned its employees from trading when it launched, so what insider trading happened?

I have searched and only when people say the magic words that resemble the actual name of "shitcoin" (that's ok, I just can't call it it's real name) are posts getting banned.

Yeah, until the transaction fee issue gets fixed, BTC is useless for small transactions.

It probably is the fee, I don't know that I've ever heard about no fee to transfer between accounts.

If you had the private keys before the fork, you have both coins. At the values you listed you'd have 20,000
