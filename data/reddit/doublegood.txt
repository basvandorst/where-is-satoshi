Are you in England mate?  If so follow this guide
You need to make a deposit from your own bank account  but not a big amount. I wouldn't bother with Paypal it's a rip off.
 It took forever to actually sort it but now if I sell anything it's sent to my bank account in about half an hour even on sundays.
If you aren't in England that's not much help to to you mate but this is the list of what countries you are able to use Coinbase and what methods of payment / withdrawal are available to you.

Glad to hear mate nice stroke of luck. Interesting days back then.
 The first time I bought bitcoin I sent cash in the post to PO box address in Jersey. Amazingly the Bitcoins appeared in my wallet as promised.

It's one of many Americanisms that have appeared in the UK and probably elsewhere. I find it disquieting.

You can get on GDAX once you are on coinbase and the prices are better.
