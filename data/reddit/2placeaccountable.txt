my account was supposedly hacked with the same results. moving into unsecured coins but at the same time thinning the account down to nothing. the reason bittrex is not contacting us back is because they are the ones bennifiting. allowing fake hacks means they can alledgely have you hacked and your account lost but it just is a thinning out if you will of accounts they wish to scrape money from. they provide you an IP address for the log in but if I suspect they probably all lead to Russian location IE at Petersburg but in vague broad strokes such as that. there is accountability for bittrex and there founders. if I could sermize we all have IPs that vaguely point to Russia but a bunch of friends in Washington state who founded bittrex have our coin Wich was purchased with real US dollars. check with your local state's attorney general they handle interstate theft better than cyber police. crypto currency theft is not above the law because its theft occurs to you as the victim in your state your state's attorney general is responsible for protecting your rights. they then in turn open a case with Washington state and a dual investigation begins. bittrex is an LLC Incorporated in NV but LLC liability laws do not protect owners from criminal action. class action lawsuits are not effective contact your state's attorney contact the FBI they handle interstate theft and if there is suspected collusion with Russian cyber hackers then Homeland security will get involved and the bar will be raised.
