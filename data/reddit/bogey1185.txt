This poses are real problem for people. If u have gains, and then sell at the start of a big dip to avoid the drop and buy up the dip, Uncle Sam ends up taking all the profit. Have I got that right?

I'm a noob who was drawn back to bitcoin as a result of all that fork hype.  I probably probably won't buy in prior to the fork because I don't really know what I'm doing.  Can anyone suggest a good source for reading up on key ownership, wallets etc?

But in order for a bitcoin to become more valuable due to scarcity, wouldn't people need to be aware that many are lost?  I mean - in the case of the guy who lost 58 million, the coins are technically still out there. They are just lost.  So unless someone keeps a list and they are reported as lost, no one will know they are unrecoverable, right? Ppl could think someone is just hodling

Such disclaimers are common practice in the tax and legal communities when posting general statements about legal liability.  The reason is because application of the law or tax code is complex and often depends on each client's individual circumstances.  If you actually hire a lawyer or accountant to represent you, and they review your specific circumstances before giving advice or counsel, their advice will not come with such disclaimers because you hired them for their expertise and you are able to rely on it.
