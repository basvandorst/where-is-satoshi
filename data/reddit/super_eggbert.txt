Nope, it's a ponzi scheme

Definitely has a relevance to bitcoin though. Can you imagine what would happen to bitcoin, if that ever happened?! If any government even attempted no cash plus the introduction of negative interest rates, people would get out of fiat as fast as they could :-)

changetip is young and is the ultimate result; in the mean time it requires knowledge of the bitcoin ecosystem as a whole. As apposed to bitcoin, which just requires knowledge of bitcoin.

There is a simple way of doing this without needing to do a custom transaction. Just take the sha256 of the file use that as the private key find the associated public address and transfer a small amount of bitcoin in and out.  Then you could prove the file existed simply by showing the hash of the file must have existed when the transaction took place.

All arguments are valid here and deserve careful consideration, but dudes: "Solar FREAKIN' Roadways"

Why would you need the blockchain? you simple need to use ECDSA. "A" submits a challenge, "B" send back the signature. I believe this is how BitID works.

That can't work, if they started doing that what's to stop me just getting illegal stuff delivered to someone I don't like to get them arrested?

But decreasing the block time doesn't fix the problem it just make it less of a problem, there is still time to wait.  Surely, the better option is a third party multi-sig which can reduce the risk of double spend to practically zero for merchants even with zero conf transactions.

I know, but they can still only perform simple calculations that can be done classically. What I'm saying is that they won't scale very far due to decoherence. Since the actual cause of the breakdowns is still unexplained, at a fundamental level, there's a good chance that there is a limiting factor. Which may mean that when a systems reaches a certain level of complexity the universe simple collapses the state and it behaves classically.

Personally I don't see it as a threat, we still don't even know if they work at scale, sure they work on very simple problems currently, but that's it.  Since we still don't know why we don't see quantum weirdness at macro scales there is no reason the same process couldn't prevents processing anything beyond a certain level of complexity.
I put it in the same category as time travel; theory says it's doable but chances are you're never going to see it.

Objectively and from a technical perspective the worst thing that could happen is the network isn't ready; things slow to a crawl and it cripples and crashes nodes. Bitcoin isn't magic; it can scale but not instantly. If any big player enters the fry they'll need to make sure that the system can handle the load or bitcoin could die in a day :-( My guess is they'll wait until the block size limit is raised and they know the network could take it.

You can't access in the UK, you'll need to use a vpn/proxy.

I don't see how a company could be held liable as bitcoins aren't things they're just a series of transaction. How could you blacklist a coin? What happens if you have 9/10 inputs to a transaction as legit with one stolen? If you had 100 outputs in such a transaction would all the outputs then be blacklisted? In which case the entire system could be blacklisted very quickly.

You're assuming there are no limits to quantum computers. The best explanation I've ever heard as to why we don't see quantum effects at the macroscopic level is because of fundamental computational limits in the universe. Which would mean if you can't do it classically then you can't do it at a quantum level. So far nothing has been achieved with a quantum computer that can't easily been done classically.
I'd bet quantum computers are going to be about as much of an issue as time travel :-)

I know that's the principle, but in practice the miners have the final say. For example, with regard to block size, if the majority of nodes accept &gt;1mb but the majority of miners don't then the longest chain will always be the one with &lt;1mb blocks. It makes no difference that the majority of nodes will allow &gt;1mb blocks there still won't be any.
@_date: 2014-10-20 14:23:53
How would they do that?
@_date: 2015-05-09 14:42:55
Where did you get that premise from? The way I understand it Bitcoin is simply a system for decentralized consensus. As long as consensus is maintained then anything can change at any point for any reason.

I think the argument against deflation is rubbish as long as the deflation is relatively low. Just look at the current situation we have inflationary currencies and savings account; I can still get more with my money tomorrow since I've got more to spend thanks to the interest I've earned.

Can't believe this was up on youtube 3 days ago and I've not seen it here yet.

Seriously, how did you come to that conclusion? They provide the work in the "proof of work". They are the deciding factor in a hard fork. If they mine blocks on the new fork then it happens if they don't then it doesn't.
Take the blocksize, even if the majority of nodes allow larger blocks it makes no difference if they are never mined!
@_date: 2015-05-19 16:50:23
Yes, but the miners would have to let that happen. Why would the miners want to make themselves mutually incompatible? If the only difference remained that &gt;1mb blocks are invalid then the only way to force a permanent split would be to make &lt;1mb blocks invalid.
@_date: 2015-05-17 07:06:50
Consensus, over the current state of the system and the rules are part of that system. Bitcoin is designed for changing rules why do you think that "version" is the first field in a block header?! If the rules where unchanging then that would be a complete waste of space.
Ultimately, the miners are pulling the strings. If the majority of blocks are being mined on a newer version then the change can be made while maintaining consensus.
@_date: 2015-02-01 16:44:47
That would only work if you had a copy of the work and knew it was happening before a confirmation. Unless of course you're proposing paying bitcoin into all addresses that show up in the mempool on the off chance that one of them is acting as a proof of copyright, in which case I'm 100% behind that idea :-)

That is the worst form of journalism, he's using the halting problem in the argument when he clearly doesn't understand it. Alan Turing did not say that you can't prove if any algorithm will terminate, just that there must exist algorithms that you can't prove will terminate.
