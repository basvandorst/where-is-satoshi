Deflationary? No Crypto is immune to DEFLATION, because new CRYPTO is created everyday, and even when bitcoin maxes out or comes close to max bitcoins.. there will still be many more and new cryptos in circulation..
Everday the world gets more and more crypto´s in circulation, thus inflation has yet not set in.. the demand is to big at the moment
But sooner or later, inevitable the new circulation and creation of crypto will catch up

Also loves fast cars, loves playing games with friends online.. Likes Trump, but tells his black friends he hates trump.

And some long options on crypto that is far superior in its currency model than bitcoin.
Bitcoins price right no reflects a product that is fee-less, 1 second transfer time, and 100% secure.
Which far from the reality, its more hope+ignorance+people already made up their mind of mega sucess product.. a bubble is a bubble.

And he is right, there is a certain price point where people just say screw it.. i dont want to pay 20x more for the same coin than what it was 10 months ago.
For btc to reach higher than 20k, people must truly believe that BTC will reach 100-200k for it to be worthwhile.

Or how Bitcoin is immune to inflation, unlike the evil dollar.. despite the effect of new cryptos appearing all over the place flooding the market with more crypto thus inflating the cryptos.

We stand loose about 200k USD if it hits 7,000.
But thats the risk we are prepared to take, we have analyzed the chart for a long time and taken the fundamentals in to it aswell.
These last couple of weeks of gaps up in price, is just a result of people "Fear of missing out" 
The price will correct itself to around 1,600 sooner or later to close all the gaps.. where we will take out half of our position to secure profits, and let the rest run down to under 500usd/btch
