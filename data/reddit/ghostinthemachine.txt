There are better algorithms for PoW, alternative consensus protocols like Proof of Space and Proof of Stake. If there is sufficient will, a future fork may adjust Bitcoin to be more sustainable and egalitarian.

Just don't launder billions of dollars in cartel money, otherwise you're going to get a hefty bailout from the government.

I love how when the price is down suddenly I'm not allowed to buy. Feels very shady.

Please hodl for the next available coin.

I thought buttcoin was dead? The papers really need to make up their minds.

Thank you good sir! You are providing a great service to the community. I will come back in a few years to reclaim my Bitcoins.

Same, friend. My anus is clenched.

This is not a game at all. This is Sparta.

@_date: 2015-05-11 00:06:07
Agreed. Well done!
@_date: 2017-01-06 06:36:35
This is the supposed real answer, so sorry to get anyone's hopes up. I'm just having a little play on worsd here

The line between crypto-coin enthusiast and gambling addict is thin and grey. Please, everyone, check yo self before you wreck yo self! If you're becoming addicted, losing sleep, unplug for a while.

I still remember the Thanksgiving when we shot up to 1,000 for the first time. Turns out that was just the beginning.

I am sad that I cannot do these micro transactions anymore.

This is Reddit, so...no help.
@_date: 2019-04-03 01:24:44
rofl I see what you did there
@_date: 2017-11-16 03:41:11
If fees were lower, I would send you some coin.

1password also supports 2fa now
@_date: 2017-11-26 03:39:43
Can someone please explain?
@_date: 2019-04-02 16:47:57
Is this from Wündershowzen??
@_date: 2016-02-24 05:12:10
How much would you pay per hour to have someone host a full node? Has anyone set up a marketplace for this?
@_date: 2019-04-24 04:31:13
I too can put words together that sound nice.
The internet is full of them!
@_date: 2016-02-21 15:34:42
This is nice! Is the source hosted somewhere? I'd like to try and mash it together with the markdown editor Dylan.

This is what excites us.

"If the math don't fit, you can't submit!" --Satoshi
@_date: 2015-03-18 03:34:45
Well, don't forget that the reward shrinks until it's nil, then everything shifts to be a transaction network. So the practice is only useful while rewards outweigh transaction fees.
@_date: 2017-05-29 03:59:53
Define "user".
@_date: 2017-05-29 04:02:37
Just print and laminate. Easy and cheap.
@_date: 2015-03-18 00:00:04
Is it just random luck when it happens? Like, it was mined before any transactions were received by the miner?
@_date: 2015-03-19 03:58:08
When Bitcoin's down, I start to frown.
I read the news. I've got the blues.
Satoshi save me, what to do?
Buy high, sell low.
It's the Bitcoin blueeees!
@_date: 2015-03-14 15:55:42
Can we just let go of Coinbase already? They're no longer a good fit for this community. That's probably ok, and we should focus on the new not keep crying about this. Too many anti coinbase posts these days. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 03:53:54
Let me tell you about all the Bitcoin and Darkcoin I used to own, before Cryptsy stole them from me...
