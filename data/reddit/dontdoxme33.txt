Stonks are going the way of the newspaper my risk-averse friend. Bitcoin has historically beaten the stock market virtually every year it's been around aside from right after a massive bull run (which typically can't be beaten in a LIFETIME of investment in the stonk market) 
You're like a newspaper reader mad that the internet is a thing, so you hop on the New York Time's website and leave an angry comment and say (PHYSICAL NEWSPAPERS ARE BETTER! I LIKE TO FEEL THE PAPER YOU DAMN MILLENNIALS!) and people read your comment and they pity your ignorance.
The future is like a freight train you dusty old fool, you can't stop it :)

I love it, more time to stock up. I think the holidays are hurting people though. Less buying/More selling due to big expenses coming up.
@_date: 2019-11-28 14:52:40
Not if you can get better returns elsewhere. 
If bitcoin only ever multiplies your money by 2 every four years you’ll beat the vast majority of income producing assets by a lot, and it’ll likely go up way more than 2X every four years like it has historically. 
Bitcoin is going to eat the world of investments over the next decade.

Agreed, you can sense it, even leaving pro bitcoin comments outside of this subreddit in some communities can lead to vicious comments and down-votes. It's bitterness, jealously and to some degree a lack of understanding, just keep the wins to yourself if you can.
@_date: 2019-11-19 15:58:17
Yeah some people tend to be very risk-averse, it's good that there's other vehicles of investment for those types of people. 
Unlike many people these days I actually respect older people, that being said older people are dying off and their money will trickle back into the hands of younger people who are more willing to invest in crypto. We have an exciting decade ahead of us.

Meh, it's just a number. Numbers are irrelevant in the world of bitcoin. For as long as bitcoin keeps being bitcoin any amount that you accumulate now will be worth quite a bit later. Just keep stacking. 
And if you do own 1 bitcoin, don't stop stacking. Greed is good and helps everyone in the long term.
@_date: 2019-11-21 16:59:30
You're an idiot. 
People will invest in bitcoin for as long as there's greed in this world. The thing about "Getting Rich" is it's never enough, people will always want more. When bitcoin is steadily above 100K in five years you'll be complaining that it's not at 1 million. 
It's very rare in the history of bitcoin for the price to cross the ATH within the same four year halving cycle, (I believe 2013 is the only time it happened). 
Be patient, you have the holidays at hand, people are selling more and buying less. When the new year hits and people are looking for places to put their money, tax returns come in, the halving happens, etc, etc we'll see the price rise again. We need to bottom out a bit before that happens though.
@_date: 2019-11-12 20:58:07
I've noticed that the older and richer a person is the more skeptical and pessimistic they seem to be about bitcoin, I'd likely be the same way if I worked my entire life for fiat and played that game, bitcoin just simply doesn't benefit somebody who's already lived their life and has money, they don't get it because they're out of touch.
Bjarne Stroustrup, as much respect as I have for him, doesn't have to worry about how he'll pay his student loans. He doesn't have to worry about how to afford a home, he doesn't have to worry about living in absolute poverty like in certain areas of Africa, he doesn't have to worry about his nation's entire currency potentially being worthless in a few years like Venezuelans. Even for middle class Americans, I don't think he understands that not everyone can invent a programming language and end up with an illustrious career at Morgan Stanley earning millions, remember he's part of the 1%, the middle class is drowning in debt. He just doesn't get it.
The net good bitcoin will do for society will far outweigh the negatives, I think over this next decade bitcoin will help to usher in a new era of wealth and prosperity which will lead to better lives for everyone.

I doubt it, it’ll certainly be remembered in the annals of history but I’m sure by then quantum computers will have cracked bitcoin’s encryption method.

@_date: 2019-11-08 21:31:11
I think we'll trend down for a few months and then in the new year strap in people. You have tax returns mixed with the hype of the halving, we could get close to 20K by May.
Then I think we'll see another sell off and perhaps a period of up to a year where we're below the past ATH and then we moon sometime in 2021

@_date: 2019-10-24 20:12:23
Think of marketcap in the hypothetical, if you want to understand something more deeply, always ask "what if" 
What if everyone decided to sell all of their bitcoins tomorrow and nobody wanted to buy? What would the marketcap be then? 0, bitcoin is worthless. No buyers=Completely worthless. This is why rocks or blades of grass aren't worth anything (unless of course you could convince somebody to buy blades of grass, then they'd be worth whatever that person paid for them) 
What if everybody in the world wanted to buy bitcoin tomorrow and nobody in the world was willing to sell? What would the marketcap be then? infinite, the price would climb up in a straight line until someone was willing to sell. The first person to sell at the given price would make the market and that would be the new listed price, but of course typically everyone has a price they'd sell at, if bitcoin hit a million tomorrow would you continue to hodl? Not many would which drive prices sharply back down until we hit an equilibrium.  
Marketcap is a very fluid and precise measure of the worth of all bitcoin currently minted, but it would be physically impossible to ever turn that into physical cash, so it's not a good measure of anything other than the total value at the current time of all bitcoin in existence, it changes dramatically on the day to day because the supply and demand at any given moment is always fluctuating the price of bitcoin.

Because other people are getting rich and this person’s not. It’s hatred and jealousy, what the haters don’t understand is that bitcoin is for everyone. 
I might be upset if I saw an asset skyrocket overnight and I didn’t own it - except I don’t let envy get the best of me. 
There’s a ton of hatred towards bitcoin all over the internet. I’m looking forward to the day that hate turns into massive fomo from everyone who’s too stupid to see the big picture.

The whole tether thing has and always will be FUD. The only way that scam works is if people trade their bitcoin for tether, so bitfinex creates some tether, convinces people to trade their bitcoin for it, holds the bitcoin, mints more tether and the cycle repeats etc etc.

People never account for inflation and future stock market gains in these assessments, you think anybody 50 years ago would have predicted a multi trillion dollar stock market? Of course not, we were still on the gold standard.
Bitcoin will hit 1 million in most of our lifetimes, who knows what the exact timeframe will look like but it will happen. The only question is how much will 1 million dollars get you when it happens
@_date: 2019-12-15 05:38:39
Depends on what you consider a moon, i think it could be entirely possible to hit 100K sometime in 2020.
In 2013, we went to 100 dollars very shortly after the halvening and then went to 1000 less than a year later. We had like a double moon. I could see us hitting 100K by summer and then later winter early spring start to see 2-300K before a recession. 
Just be prepared either way, now is the time to buy

I really think this is gonna be the decade of bitcoin. 2010’s were the decade of the smartphone and look at smartphones now, I’m literally typing this on an iPhone 11 that looks like something out of a sci-fi movie. 2020’s are the decade of bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-12-05 06:18:40
Yes, I think bitcoin will hit $100,000 sometime within the next year or two. 
Every hundred invested now turns into over $1,000 by the time we moon. 
You’re talking anywhere between $12,000-$24,000 at current prices. 
That’s a new car, that’s potentially a college degree, that’s a downpayment on a house, you name it. 
100% worth it
@_date: 2019-12-01 23:04:09
It does have an immediate effect it can just take time for the market to catch up. 
I think we’ll have a mini bull run around the time of the halvening and I think we’ll beat the previous ATH and go close to 100K
Then later around 2021 we’ll see 200K-300K and then another multi year bear market. 
Many people will use their funds to pay down student loan debt, pay off houses, etc etc which will free up even more money to propel subsequent runs.
We have an exciting decade ahead of us.
@_date: 2019-12-27 06:24:15
I think retail investors are wising up to the stock to flow line/chart. We’ve been trending toward that line ever since the mini bubble happened last summer
@_date: 2019-12-02 07:01:08
All else being equal, you’ll double your money every four years. That beats most investments by a mile. Once you understand and believe in bitcoin you never go back, I have faith that everyone here will continue to invest in bitcoin for most of their lives with many more people to come (unless something better comes along) 
I’m young, I’d love to own a house but the thought of a 30 year mortgage feels like slavery to me. In my lifetime, my generation might make the mortgage a thing of the past. 
Think about it, a mortgage is slavery to the bank. We’re slaves to bankers. Bitcoin can and will change that. We’re living through history. This is like when the world switched from Kings to Democracies. We the people are overthrowing the system that we’re all slaves to. We’re living through history.
@_date: 2019-12-02 06:41:58
Litecoin gets absolutely dwarfed by bitcoin, it almost always follows its price trend. There’s just not enough people ONLY buying and selling Litecoin for you to see a difference, not true with bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-12-17 19:02:51
This works until the people own all of the bitcoin, banks can print money at will by issuing loans, they can't print more bitcoin. 
So banks are either buying it and holding it which is good for bitcoin, or buying it and selling it which is good for bitcoin, or they're ignoring it which also happens to be good for bitcoin. Those are the only three options. 
You conspiracy theorists are whackos. Either that or you're just not thinking big picture. Continue to buy and hold to suck the power away from the banks, it's that simple.
@_date: 2019-12-15 05:35:26
Yeah but they’ll be receiving half as many, so even if they are selling them all now they’ll only have half as much to do so after May of 2020. That causes a supply shock to a demand that will likely stay steady but more likely increase and that’s when you start to moon. 
Real moon comes when all the people who tuned out start to pay attention again and FOMO us to 100K
@_date: 2019-12-05 14:43:02
Yeah man, I can’t give you financial advice because I don’t know your situation but I’m going to assume you’re on the younger side. When you’re young it’s the best time to take a few risks. 600 dollars in the grand scheme of things is a very small amount of money. You’ll likely earn millions over the course of your career and you’ll look back and laugh when you think of how much importance you put into small amounts of money. I definitely did it when I was younger and now I earn six figures, 600 dollars is pretty trivial to me at this point. 
All that being said the upside to bitcoin is incredible, given the slim chance losing 200 dollars or turning it into 2000 in a few years I’m going to try to turn it into 2000 every time. And I don’t gamble, I detest gambling. These are calculated risks based on prior information and a deep understanding of how bitcoin works.

Well thankfully bitcoin is a global currency, so not just US and there’s plenty of millionaires in this world who’d like to become billionaires.
@_date: 2019-12-05 07:27:12
Well there’s virtually no chance it’ll hit zero, if it was worthless it would’ve hit zero already. For as long as there’s people who want to make money in this world bitcoin will always have value. 
This is just classic mid-moon FUD. This is where the people who don’t really “get it” get scared. This is late 2015 folks. Just HODL on and be patient these people will be silenced shortly.
@_date: 2019-12-15 05:27:08
The key here is that the more billionaires who realize bitcoin is worth owning the more the price goes up. By its very nature they can’t own it all. 21 million club is real. 
The only regret I ever hear from people regarding bitcoin is that they didn’t buy more.
@_date: 2019-12-05 16:13:02
That's very nitpicky but yes you are correct
@_date: 2019-12-15 05:43:56
This a fallacy, you can’t “price in” a real-time event. Regardless of what the speculators are doing, in May of 2020 there will be less new bitcoin to sell. This will drive the price up as long as demand stays the same.
@_date: 2019-12-13 16:18:54

Well no, the only thing you have to rely on is the bitcoin software. If I know the keys to an address with bitcoin in it then that's my bitcoin, I can generate the wallet and send the bitcoin to any other address all via the bitcoin software. 
If you want to buy or sell bitcoin then you have to rely a third party exchange, but only until you send it off of the exchange and into a wallet of your sole custody.
