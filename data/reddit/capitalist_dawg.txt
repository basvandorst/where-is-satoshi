Look up the core devs background bios.  Don't take my word for it.
@_date: 2017-11-11 07:03:03
Bitcoin core developers.  Nick Szabo etc.
@_date: 2017-11-11 07:12:07
All of them?  Who is developing BCH?
@_date: 2017-11-11 09:17:44
1500 for BCH is not a discount.  I am concerned it won't even get there but if it does I will START dumping around there.  Its a miner coin with no users and zero hope of success.  Just trying to convert it to as much bitcoin as possible.

I agree.  My only point is that they are the most accomplished development team in the crypto space.

The goal for real bitcoin is to let these idiots dump there bitcoin, buy it as cheap as possible, change PoW to destroy their cartels.  Once they are fully excised from bitcoin then their shitcoin will be attacked.  I want every last cent they have.  I want to see their hardware firesaled on ebay.

I am going to tell you a secret.  We are going to take all of your money and destroy your mining cartels.  You are neckbeards with graphic cards thinking you know more than some of the worlds best cryptographers, scientists, economists and developers.  We are going to take your money and make examples of you.

Destroy Bitmain.  Fuck the traitors.  Take their money.

But can I buy a happy meal with it?

If you all succeed in killing Bitcoin: (1) It deserved to die because it was broken and insecure; (2) all crypto currencies will become totally worthless except for shits and giggles (ala Doge).  I blame core for not decentralizing mining long ago.  It was an obvious attack vector and here we are.  One guy in China, a certifiably fake Satoshi imposter and a convicted felon have managed to con a shit load of people and convince them to actually attack bitcoin to their own detriment.  Pretty amazing.

If you think that people are going to widely adopt a cryptocurrency with one developer that is totally controlled by one guy in China you are out of your fucking mind.  If bitcoin dies - everything dies.  Not one honest dollar will come into crypto again.  You are a miner.  You are a minor very replaceable piece of this.  You are the dumb component.  The easily manipulated short term profit uneducated piece.  You don't understand what Bitcoin is.  You don't know who created it.  You don't know why.  You don't what it is meant to be.  You don't understand the threats all crypto faces and you don't understand why Bitcoin as digital gold will prevail and why buying coffee with crypto is fucking retarded and subjects you to attack.  You don't know what you are doing and you are in over your head.

Dump your bitcoin idiot.  Do it.  You are not smart enough to play this game and we are going to take every cent you have to your name.
@_date: 2017-11-11 05:59:35
Miners have no say in Bitcoin any longer.  Attack bitcoin - get attacked back.
@_date: 2017-11-11 05:12:21
I am hoping you guys can pump BCH to $1500 or so before I dump it.  I will keep a small percentage of BCH as well.   Centralized mining cartels compromised the bitcoin protocol.  Its a shame.
@_date: 2017-11-11 07:51:19
What makes you think they are not?
@_date: 2017-10-24 05:10:32
Everything said in this article is complete garbage.  Every point is wrong.  He is completely and utterly wrong.  Bitcoin is everything he says it isn't.
@_date: 2017-10-23 04:03:25
Only flaw is to change "dumbest guy in high school" to "nerdiest" or something similar.  Aren't many dumb people in crypto.
