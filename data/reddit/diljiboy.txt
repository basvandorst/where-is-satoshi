Does it work for amazon.ca?
@_date: 2014-07-28 16:56:17
I do realize PrivateInternetAccess supports BTC, I just linked their payment page to give you a sense of how PayGarden works. Now you can buy a BestBuy Giftcard with BTC on gyft, and spend it all over the place with PayGarden.

Not sure... Probably US only. Just like everything else...
@_date: 2014-07-28 17:08:01
iOS users you can download the app [here](
Here is a [link]( for non-iOS users to view the app.

How does snapCard work? I've never actually heard of it...
@_date: 2014-07-31 15:37:01
It's not my website. I used during the summer sale, was very happy with it. Now that it's back up, I thought I'd tell you all about it. I'm assuming your talking about the credit? $50 credit costs $51?
@_date: 2014-03-19 22:29:01
Yes I have a blockchain backup to dropbox. One more question: If I want to spend my coins I'll have to transfer them to one service right?
@_date: 2014-07-20 14:09:51
How do you deal with chargebacks? (Probably a stupid question, as every company that accepts credit card has to deal with this.)

Can you pick me up a taco if you're still on the area?
@_date: 2014-04-15 01:58:49
gyft.com is as close as your gonna get!
@_date: 2014-04-17 12:12:32
But how do you accomplish &gt;0 conf? Everything is 0 Conf at one point?
@_date: 2014-07-28 00:17:12
Yes you can buy steam wallet cards: steamloader.com
@_date: 2014-03-31 23:17:04
Best way to store bitcoins—an online digital currency is offline? What? lol
@_date: 2014-12-09 12:43:38
I was not trying to be a troll. I had a legitimate question. As you can see above I've edited the post thanking everyone who has responded.
@_date: 2014-07-29 15:39:12
Try rebooting. Then tapping on the new icon. It should then start installing.

How many people are a part of the HeliosCard Team? Who designed the card? Does it work with any Credit card terminal?
@_date: 2014-07-28 00:37:02
Yeah, went under maintenance a while ago. Hasn't come back yet. I personally did get to use it before it did go offline. Works great! Costs $21 in BTC for a $20 steam wallet code.

Still waiting for my invite, signed up months ago... :(

**NOTE:** If you are jailbroken and have the old wallet app installed, make sure you un-install that via cydia, before installing the new Blockchain app.
@_date: 2014-07-31 16:46:10
I'm assuming it is because it costs the owner money to buy the cards.
@_date: 2014-03-28 01:08:46
Thank you for the heads up!
@_date: 2014-08-24 03:14:09
People mine to secure the network. Not just for profit.
@_date: 2014-03-28 00:47:36
Fair enough.
@_date: 2014-07-13 20:57:21
Canada, Why?
@_date: 2014-08-01 16:32:57
I think could benefit from using the Naut theme: @_date: 2014-07-28 17:19:52
Interesting. PayGarden, is something I discovered yesterday and only a handful amount of websites seem to support it. SnapCard seems much more useful.
@_date: 2014-03-19 22:50:11
Awesome! Thanks a bunch!
@_date: 2014-12-15 22:39:53
Ok, I have the security pretty much maxed on BCI, but as a precaution you say I should use either Greenaddress.it or coinkite. If I use Greenaddress.it the only thing concerning for me is their nLockTime system. I don't really understand what it is. Any help? What would be the best way to move my funds? Sweeping the address in GreenAddress.it or moving them to the new address?
@_date: 2014-07-15 16:45:39
@_date: 2014-03-19 22:37:36
Hmm... Very intriguing stuff.
@_date: 2014-07-28 20:12:49
The app store will try to "overwrite" the original package installed by cydia. At this point, the new app won't finish installing, and the old app cannot be used. Therefore you must un-install the old app via cydia, before the new blockchain app can finish installing.
@_date: 2014-03-19 22:38:36
Already have multibit setup! :)
You didn't answer my question however. Will I need to move all my coins to the same address in order to spend?
@_date: 2014-07-31 18:01:33
Some important questions you can answer on this thread: 
**EDIT:** Why aren't you using coinbase as the payment processor anymore?

Hoping I don't get banned for this... But take a look at the  twitter account: [link]( It is automatically set to tweet hot links from this subreddit. As a side effect of what has been happening, it has links to most of the censored links in this subreddit.

I'd like to moderate. I ain't new to the moderation game either. I am a mod of and @_date: 2015-02-02 16:39:37
Available in Canada too now!
@_date: 2015-02-07 20:12:33
I'm a Canadian and this blew my mind!
@_date: 2015-02-07 20:15:24
Probably going to get downvoted for this, but we Canadians get jack shit up here, so I'm glad this service is Canada only for now. You can now understand how we feel up here! :)
@_date: 2015-02-19 02:09:17
Ok deleted. I found a different solution. Sorry
