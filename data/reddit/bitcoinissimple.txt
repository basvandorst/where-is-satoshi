Buy now. Yes the price could fall but nobody, nobody can Tell you forsure if or when that will happen. I've put based bitcoin at a higher price then this.
Only wales and thefts can movie a price, or big changes in code, it's highly unpredictable. You believe in it then you'll just keep buying.

The hacker has no benefit in returning coins even at 25% because he will still go to jail if they find out who he is.
If the reward is to simply reveal who the hacker is then it seems like a good reward. If the reward is only given if the coins are somehow returned, then good luck with that, not very good odds.

If I had to choose one thing it would have to be that miners could possibly control it.

"When it shot up high, I said I don't want to be one of those people who watches and watches it and cares about the number. I don't want that kind of care in my life,"
Uhhh.....so just ignore the price then. What the fuck. It's like saying I have a Pontiac sunfire, and I upgraded to a Tesla. However, I got rid of my Tesla because I don't want to have to drive around 24/7. I Wish there was some way I could only drive around sometimes.

I guess everything depends. Your level of dedication, how much your willing to spend, your knowledge.
It sounds to me like your asking the very basic question, a beginner's question, is bitcoin a good investment, but then you want to jump into the more advanced world of mining.

@_date: 2018-09-12 14:03:16
Do you know what a confirmation is? When you send or receive Bitcoin to another person you see "confirmation times"
I might screw this up a little but:
1 confirmation means it's been added to the blockchain.
2 confirmation means there is at least 1 block that's been added since your block was included. 
3 confirmations means there at least 2 blocks that have been added to the blockchain since your block was last included.
Everytime a block gets added and your block goes further back into the chain it becomes more cemented into history or irreversible because of the way Bitcoin works.
@_date: 2018-09-12 14:06:06
Then reword it to something more appropriate. I have friends who don't know what a confirmation is. At least having them slightly informed is better then nothing.

@_date: 2017-12-18 00:13:00
In my opinion as long as it's a locked in exchange rate, or contract, and ks secure, then it is Bitcoin. Doesn't matter if it's a proxy token.
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:23:24
Not the answer your looking for but, buy a hardware wallet like a trezor or a ledger nano s
@_date: 2017-12-30 11:36:26
So if lightning doesn't work you can always just make the blocks bigger and do the same as Bitcoin cash.

Good job Jimmy. However a debate like that shouldn't take place without a strict moderator who totally controls a situation.
I don't think debating like that especially is the best way to get Information out to the public.

@_date: 2018-08-19 19:40:44
Yes I see what your saying. I just not sure it would actually happen that way. 
If a beer is worth $100 then it's because the dollar has had hyperinflation and is worthless.
A bitcoin might still be considered highly valuable.
I'm not an expert just typing my thoughts. 
If a beer costs $100 then a bitcoin might be worth 100 million...........

The easiet way that should also be extremely secure would be to buy this 
Then create the 3 keys and put them in safe places.
You could for example buy a good quality fireproof safe for your home and keep one of the keys locked up their.
Put another key in a safety deposit box in a bank.
And I don't know figure a good spot for a third key...any ideas people!?
It only does  2 of 3 multisig, not more such as 3 of 5. And it doesn't do passwords
You just need to ensure whatever you are making a cold storage (offline wallet) that it is secure. I don't read code so I rely on the community of programmers that do to tell me if it's safe.
The immediate way it to use 
But you need to follow specific way of going about it I suggest you search for old posts. I don't know if it does multisignature yet I haven't checked but it does do password protected. 
As for creating a password on your wallet. Your likely to forget a password. I do recommend creating one however it has to be an excessively easy password, something that you have remembered all your life, such as your wife's sister name. And you could even write on the paper wallet "wifes sisters name" so you never forget the password. As humans we always forget password, therefore you are likely to lose bitcoins by doing so. So the password is really just their as something to slow down a their, but not completely stop them.

I saw the bitcoin articles on engadget and gizmodo but I never read about it because I assumed it was like a bonus bucks, a token, or like xbox points, I had no idea. 
I know myself and I would have likely invested anywhere from $2000-$5000 when Bitcoins cost around $10-20 dollers (which is what it was at when I really was skipping all the online articles)
So yea I missed out but just think that only 21 million people can only have 1 bitcoin and were already ahead of the game.

I'm sure some Bitcoin startups are a safer bet. 
But good luck buying shares before a public Initial public offering. (IPO)
You have to be an acreddited investor, which basically means you already have to be rich to invest.
We know Bitcoin MIGHT fail or one day be over taken. We also know that cryptocurrency is here now and will always be a thing. Therefore your best bet is to diversify. Buy mostly Bitcoin, but keep an eye one other currencies.

All the combined properties of Bitcoin are what make it valuable. The properties define what it can be used for, like as a currency. There has been nothing with these same combined properties before Bitcoin. Bitcoins value comes from the fact that it's an encypted network that has the ability to verify a transaction. The fact that they are secure and not counterfeit-able and there is only a limited amount available, etc. The fact is, value is a human perception. Some things have intrinsic value, like food because we can eat it or titanium because you can build very strong but very lightweight things with it. We also value things that are beautiful, scarce or hard to come by, like gold, diamonds, truffles, 1961 Corvettes and van Gogh paintings. We value money because of its utility as a medium of commerce. We can trade it for things which have real intrinsic, artistic or collectible value.

1. Bitcoin isn't designed so people can make money. Bitcoin is a distributed network that uses math for trust instead of a centralized government and/or the federal reserve. It creates freedom. It's just a better system, but it's in its infancy. 
2. You can make money mining however it might be a risky venture and require an expensive computer. For the typical person, just buy bitcoins. 
3. Never store your bitcoin in anything except for an encrypted paper wallet. Not an online wallet service.

We need to increase transaction volume by creating useful disruptive businesses like open bazaar, light house, gambling, etc, we need more, and a few years of time.

I suppose you can still have free content with adds supported and have the individual choose

In the long run might replace even functions of government. 
Investors marc andreesen founder of the Internet browser! (net worth 600 million)

Chamath Palihapitiya, ex-Facebook executive. (Net worth 1.2 billion) Talks about the collapse of the most famous (largest) Bitcoin exchange MT. Gox
  
Bitcoin can do "smart contract"
Think replacing all lawyers, and contracts, wills, etc with contracts. Also essentially making these services free.
Why buy Bitcoin?
So many reasons:
One great reason is to effectively as a safety against the ultimate collapse of the dollar. If the dollar does ever collapse, might be a good security. Every single fiat money system in history has collapsed
There are many markets of investment.
Just the market of gold ALONE is 8.6 trillion.
assuming Bitcoin costs about $1000 dollers today.
If Bitcoin captures just 1% Of gold as an investment for people, that's 86billion. That's like an 800 or 900 % increase. 
Goldman Sachs, one of the largest banks of the world, has calculated the advantages of using bitcoin in global economy. The figure obtained is quite impressive – 200 billion USD.
So much more news then what I have shown you but that's a good start I guess.

Time. It's going to take time. And adoption by people, but it's not ready for mass adoption. Businesses first have to build the tools  for example in my opinion it needs to be a simple as 1, 2, 3 for grandma to make a offline paper wallet and this simplicity needs to be extended to the rest of Bitcoins many faucets.

If you want to use a service that holds long term (and not your own cold storage)
Why not have two two private addresses that sends the money back and forth every few months. This would be preset by a user and might by-pass the silly law (I didn't check forsure if it would)
I would like to know how these exchange business such as circle and coinbase etc are planning to operate around this. Unless funds that are hd in cold storage by them don't count?

uhh I dont really know how to use github. i know right? same goes with twitter or facebook. O well :D
perhaps you can throw it in? copy/paste you guys just need a reminder is all, right? go for it man.
i say just play around with it. use colors green and red as notifiers if it fits your app. there doesnt have to be TWO send boxes, it can simply remain one box for entering an amount.
always ensure if a person does click confirm, and hasn't entered the amount a second time, that it notifies the person they must "enter the amount again" because its "above your preset limit" so people immediately realize because they are bound to forget the higher they set the limit (because that means they will be using it less often with a higher limit)
i think a nice default limit should personally be like around 40 dollers because thats what most people carry in cash comfortably, well at least I do

Needed feature (for all bitcoin wallets)
A user specified amount, where the amount outgoing (being sent) must be full input twice to ensure an amount more than intended is not sent.
Example: I set my limit to $100. For 100 and beyond I must now enter in the amount two times.
So if I want to send $300 it will ask for the amount to be typed again before the confirm button lights up green and allows you to send or something.
* note: it is important that it's not just a button that says "do you really want to send $300" or "confirm payment $300" because people get lazy and don't read that, and it becomes a habit to skip by it.
Tired of seeing people send the wrong amount !!!!!!

There are many markets of investment.
Just the market of gold ALONE is 8.6 trillion.
assuming Bitcoin costs about $1000 dollers today.
If Bitcoin captures just 1% Of gold as an investment for people, that's 86billion. That's like an 800 or 900 % increase.

This needs to be fixed, badly, losing coins, especially by leaving them on another wallet.
The most simple method I can think of is having some sort of main wallet with your seed words. When using any secondary wallet, it should have a setting some sort of expiry date where it auto uploads to your main wallet.
Perhaps developers could do something better. 
@_date: 2017-03-06 16:12:44
I'm sorry but I disagree, every human makes mistakes and forgets things, that doesn't mean bitcoin should be lost forever and essentially destroyed, which is a comparison, since it's likely never going to be used again. We have the ability to address the issue.
It's about fixing a problem lots of people have. It's the same thing as fixing another simple problem, sending someone 200$ when you meant to send them 20$. These are issues, they just aren't being addressed yet.
Having a backup seed words for lost or destroyed phone etc is great. It's about solving the other issue of forgetting about those seed words, or wallet.

Or they find the gold again, tomorrow. With bitcoin it can be much easier to lose or even remember which one of the zillion wallets you had the private keys on. 
If you could make a simple universal way to not lose your gold you 
probably would.
We could do that for Bitcoin or Bitcoin wallets.
If your the one who lost your gold you would care more. Making Bitcoin Les easy to lose would only help with adoption, the rich bitcoiner won't need to be more rich, by hoping you lose your coin.

We’re still developing the system, now entirely in the open source on github.com, but at this point we know we will use BTC only for permissionless payment delivery to user and publisher wallets that we will create using BitGo’s APIs. We hope to keep funds in BTC only in monthly payment buffers, to reduce effects of volatility. We intend to let expert users “bring their own BTC” to self-fund their wallets and auto-micropay for as much of their browsing as they like

I agree with unnecessary hastyness of all this. Maybe I'm wrong but I feel while it's great to have a plan, the most important thing is to not rush your plan whatever it may be.
Bitcoin works wonderfully as a store of value that cannot be confiscated. If it just remained that it would still be successful. This scaling thing will just make it worth more faster, but it's not even Completely necessary, at least not yet.

The other comic about bitcoins death actually made more sense as bitcoin is pronounced dead by large media corporations, or famous economists. 
This comic is really just a play on what some jackass in this forum thinks, and those particular persons may have no logic behind their thoughts, or have other motives. 
I personally believe bitcoin has the potential to be worth dramatically more, but not without adoption or use cases, which take lots of code and time.
Point being, the other comic is a better representation of my beliefs and therefore is more funny.

I'm not hoping for an immediate solution. I'm saying as far as I know right now it's not even on the list of problems.
Your point about the internet being too difficult is exactly my point. Just because we can lose bitcoins right now, doesn't mean we shouldn't make improvements to that area later. The developers probably will, I just am not aware of the work being done in this area.
If you made Bitcoin work even for "irrisponsible" people, it would be easier to accept adoption. It would also mean less likely hood of you losing your money. People are all talk until it happens to them, and it hasn't even happened to me.

Passwords are encrypted then hosted on trezor cloud.
With other solutions you have one main password to unlock and discover your encrypted passwords. 
With trezor you use the device to authenticate a passcode and it scrambles the order of the passcode each time and is never entered into the computer
Is that correct? Is it as safe as a solution? Is it the part of the same.solution used to keep your bitcoins safe?
@_date: 2018-10-25 02:13:01

Um, no this is not a good thing for bitcoin. It's a cryptocurrency being hacked and this damages crypto reputation and confuses and worries newcomers who may have been interested but see the news. 
It wouldn't really matter if bitcoin is the winner, unless you just in it for only profit you shoukd want all crypto to succeed. 
The only good thing coming out of this is hopefully that we have learnt something.

Humans will ultimately decide. If you want another system where that's not capable then go build it. code was exploited that is correct, but it didnt operate as intended.
Imagine an untrue scenario, where ALL bitcoin users, had 90% of their funds stolen. Do you think that if it was possible for the miners to get consensus and rollback that we should ignore that ability?
Now if a dictator took over mining and forced changes now that's a different story.
@_date: 2019-11-08 03:41:25
It does use a good amount of power but
1. that power is likely less than what the banks etc use
2. apparently It is utilising a lot of wasted power because Bitcoin miners like to go where power is underutilized and therefore cheap
3. It is actually help renewable companies fund their projects and become profitable and expand.
4. The power it does use is not wasted but actually part of the security mechanism of bitcoins proof of work. (Prevents Bitcoin from being hacked)
@_date: 2016-06-19 07:47:35
How does one decide if this code was operating as intended?.....really, that's a silly question. 
They never "intended" for all investors funds to be stolen?
Developers did see how it was coded and called for a fix.
The appropriate people simply didn't realise or believe this was possible, and didn't provide a fix until it was to late. If you are trying to say the code was running as it should have then I agree.

The current system is working well for them, and they might not all understand the technology. They seemingly have not bought in yet. They could have but we don't know.
There are probably about 1800 billionaires on this planet (wikipedia)
So if in 5 years they decide Bitcoin is the future and want to risk a fairly large amount of their net worth any put in say 25% of their worth then Bitcoin would be worth about 460 billion.

Well_did_you 
Sure you can say bitcoin has a third party but that third party does not need to be trusted. Huge difference.
Also you said bitcoin is terribly innefecient. Actually If you look at all the power consumption of banks and transportation etc it adds up to a much greater innefeciency. At least that's what an actual study with data was able to determine.
@_date: 2018-10-15 19:22:31

I think bitcoin will still win and mimblewimble be a good sidechain where we use the lightning network.
Of course it can be its own coin I guess on its own chain. I just don't see it becoming a thing. Nothing has unset Bitcoin yet. Not z cash. Not proof of stake etc etc. 
Maybe I don't understand it enough or maybe there is not that much to understand and in right.

No not really. I'm a believer in bitcoin but all these other coins aren't hurting bitcoin. They might hurt your pocket book if your unlucky, but not bitcoin. They are like testing ground. Even ethereum itself will actually help bitcoin it seems. With rootstock a sidechain, ethereum is basically running on bitcoin. Then you can use all the easily made ethereum apps in bitcoins environment.

@_date: 2016-11-20 23:40:03
I'm guessing but square needs to promote itself. Maybe have some sort of incentive for people to become early adopters of bitsquare. Maybe get some funding somehow, possibly think of some services it could offer, and continue building it out and solving people issues or concerns with it.
For myself I've never used it because I have access to be able to purchase bitcoin, and then I heard it hard no real exchange market so I just ignored it. Don't get.me wrong I think it's a very important project if it truly is decentralised.

It sounds like (if your a legitimate user and not a scammer) that using bitsquare might be safer for buying bitcoin then selling it perhaps?
....because if you legitimately want to buy a bitcoin pay, Once you get the bitcoin your happy, your not even going to attempt to reverse the bank transaction.
...when selling you have to worry about the other person attempting a bank reversal

Ethereums DAO had an unintended exploit which allowed the hacker to basically steal ethereum. 
 Then the dudes that made ethereum said let's fork it and go back in time to make sure he doesn't get the ethereum. Then it was forked but the old chain still lived and had value so the community called it ethereum core.
2 chains still live, and hacker still made money. 
@_date: 2016-12-02 03:41:18
I agree. Pointless. 
@_date: 2016-12-18 07:02:33
My opinion.
It's easier to guess when the price is going to go up then down. Anything can make the price go down, a whale selling, a hack, fake news, negative real news, bitcoins Potential simply stalling long enough could drop the price, etc, etc. You never know when those things are going to happen.
You can predict a price jump when you hear about massive software improvements for bitcoin, and if they work, and add additional scaling or useful features you know the Bitcoin price can rise. Of course until those are actually implemented, running  and proven working, rises and falls will happen, but be as less significant.
There no way of knowing, forsure what the price will do. I would buy. 2017 has lots of possible improvements coming. 
I believe in bitcoin long term though and I don't panick much.

I would be surprised if any of this including the US elections impacted bitcoin in any significant way right now. Unless it completely messed up their money, which I'm guessing it won't. 
I think programming, hardware advancements, and today's companies either investing in or acquiring bitcoin startups always appears to be bigger deal. 
@_date: 2019-08-23 14:39:09
Blocksizes will eventually get increased, hopefully not by too much, because Bitcoin has to stay accessible to as many people as possible and stay decentralized.
Without decentralisation Bitcoin is useless.
Hopefully other technologies (aka lightning etc) require little to no blocksize increase.
This is the way I currently see it.

Congratulations on discovering what's probably going to be the most valueable investment choice you could have ever have made, if bitcoin works out and can fulfill its potential.
What you need to begin to understand and learn is why the network is secure.  also why keeping bitcoin decentralised is rather important, if it was centralised it wouldn't be much different from what we have with today's financial networks.

When people ask me "What is it backed by?" I think what the average person really are meaning to ask is why should I trust it. So even though my answer is technically incorrect it's thought provoking for most people, they need to dig in further to really know what I'm talking about, which is why I then tell them to try to understand proof of work etc.
I usually then proceed to tell a person dollars aren't backed by anything. That's when they respond that dollars are backed by gold you tell them they are not and the confusion really begins. Lol

“For the first time, developers can leverage the secure enclave to manage a user’s keys in an iPhone, achieving a similar level of security to hardware wallets,” Alejandro Machado, co-founder at Open Money Initiative, told crypto news site The Block, adding the implications for cryptocurrency developers are significant.

No. You are a money transmitter if you sell Bitcoin to someone. They consider that the job of a regulated corporation. People have already been in trouble for this.

This. I could see a service where you pay a small fee if you need cash instantly. Basically they could just pay you in Lightning to fill your wallet. This might require a credit history or something, but might be viable service

@_date: 2015-07-31 05:54:01
I AGREE WITH THIS MAN
I think many people would like to begin shopping immediately so only have them fill in what is necessary. If you must know the country for a shopper to get a better deal (lower cost shipping etc) then so be it, but if there are any questions that can be filled in "later" and aren't as important then that would be beneficial as I believe it is human nature for people to want to see if the product exists or is a bargain first before they reach out into the bitcoin world, particularly if they don't own any bitcoin "first" and they are simply using open bazaar and it is their first experience with bitcoin.
looks fantastic though
@_date: 2019-06-07 13:41:46
Bitcoin adoption is inevitable because it's open source and keeps getting better, and it has a strong monetary policy with it's algorithms.
It's is less of a gamble than buying stocks of a company that you may have no idea what the future looks like because you don't have an insiders persepctive or work on the board
@_date: 2015-08-03 16:43:43
By paying in bitcoin technically your supporting Bitcoin.
You are introducing a new person into Bitcoin, they will someday eventually spend them.
If they already know and accept Bitcoin well you still pay in Bitcoin because that is he system you've chosen to use because of your personal reasoning for it: freedom, control, etc.
I have not really spent any bitcoins yet but that's more of my own logical reasoning and that will change for me one day.

Only hold your Bitcoin on a hardware wallet such as ledger or Trezor. It is the safest way. I recommend the Trezor. Watch videos of it on YouTube.
Buying Bitcoin depends where you are

I would also like to know more.
@_date: 2017-04-12 19:30:48
Im sure you know this but It's more then just improving a congested network, according to the experts, instant payments, micropayments that work, allows for safe exchanges. This is a big deal even if you don't have a congested network, being able to actually go into a store that accepts Bitcoin and pay a TINY lightning fee and having the transaction show up instantly so you can walk out immediately should allow for much greater adoption and use in actual stores. 
I've only had a few long wait times with bitcoin. That's said I probably didn't pay a high fee. Not 100% sure. I don't use Bitcoin for paying for coffee yet.

@_date: 2016-02-16 03:20:07
Please don't break it?
Centralization could break it.
User base is relatively small. Now is the time we can afford to be more risky. 
In my opinion why not try everything else first, lightning, segregated witness,  and whatever new discoveries pop up. Likely all we need is more smart people looking at the problems and they will be solved in some way. 
I believe I was watching something with Andreas and he was discussing email spam and how regulators were going to do something about it then the problem solved itself as new ways of handling the tech were discovered. 
This is my current thought as someone who is not a developer or programmer. 
Maybe you need to be more informed of consequences what could happen if we just took the easiest route.
This doesn't mean I'm for classic or core. I simply think that  "I'm a user" is not best advice going forward to improve bitcoin.

It's almost irrelevant with bitcoin, meaning it doesn't matter if it only exists digitally.  Cash is only important for privacy and to stop confiscation.
The fact that Bitcoin is digital but has no central authority means it has the second properties of cash.
@_date: 2017-04-29 22:46:06

A paper wallet done correctly is safe. You can even make it with a password and write the password on it. That way adds an additional step for hackers, Incase you do the setup wrong.
Or just buy a trezor

Well I mean I understand there could be catastrophic failure or some major bug in the code but I'm prepared to accept that scenario
I still have the understanding of the underlying principles of the blockchain , proof of work, it's open source etc.....
@_date: 2016-09-05 07:17:15
It's my rudimentary opinion that you might be off, in the growth part. 
If you don't restrict the growth or blocksize then it might become more centralised. Might just get taken over ? 
A centralised blockchain could be compared to a one world central bank. A bank with ultimate control. Thenthere is no point. 
Maybe I'm an idiot. I dunno.
Increase the blocksize and It will also be used by more people and companies they will likely rub bitcoin computers, which would decentralised it again. 
I dunno, it seems like dynamic blocks seems like the only logical path forward. However I don't understand all the intricite dynamics of it.

I'm a bitcoiner and i don't even use it yet. I don't have a use case for it, YET, other than having a store of value and financial control. That does not mean that it won't be used in the future or that it won't be more valueable it just happens to be the current reality.

@_date: 2016-09-14 00:29:43
While I agree that it will.  In the meantime you still have another fee to add when you convert bitcoin to fiat. Businesses need to hold bitcoin like they hold any government currency. it just needs to be accepted as money, and for it to be accepted it needs special cases where people use it. Its a time and programming issue. That's the only thing required

Who cares. It's open source.

Cool story about him (I believe I read this somewhere)
I believe he got his Bitcoin stolen from mt Gox. Not sure if he got his money back from that or not. Probably he realised it was his mistake for leaving them on mt Gox.

Can I choose to not pay any website and collect the bitcoin And spend it where I choose?
While its current functionality appears good I definitely need to be able to send exact amounts where I want. Will the functionality I am describing be added at some point?
Also, developers, myself as well as others want the option for the mobile browser interface to be more normal something with similar functionality to chrome. Just add it as an option for the love of God. Thanks.
It does appear from the websites lingo that it will be controlled by the user in the end, so the user can choose exactly what funds are going towards such as a music content purchase. 
The website says "And if you are feeling generous, you may route your earnings back to the sites you..."
This better be the case.

Manipulation is means manipulation. It doesn't mean full control. If they are manipulating they would bring the price up to a new record high if they could I'm sure. I would assume manipulators only need large swing in price up and down.
Hopefully no manipulation is occurring that would be great but unlikely.

I started buying some Bitcoin at $1000 when Reddit told me it wouldn't go down. That was bullshit, it was definitely going down, but as someone new I had no clue as to how new the market was, what it was like. I could of bought more Bitcoin if I had waited to buy. 
Also missed a boat load of shitcoin opportunities that I would shave profited majorly on because of Bitcoin maximalists telling me everything is a shitcoin. I am a Bitcoin maximalist myself but I still would have profited hugely if I had not read their advice.

 if the robot taxis pay for themselves and take care of themselves then how you would they take care of us or pay us?

It depends on when you want to retire. In 15 years it's possible that what you have could get worth 280 million.  However do you really need 280 million to be happy. Money doesn't make people happy,  spending it on activities and family does. Start spending it when you feel it's earned enough that your happy with what it's become. In my opinion the longer you are able to wait the more it will be worth.
I bet you'll be able to retire in 5 years with that amount of Bitcoin once all these other second later technologies are integrated. 
First and foremost I hope you have a hardware wallet such as a ledger nano s or a trezor. 
Would it help your children to tell them? Probably Not unless you were going to pass away. It would be beneficial if they could somehow get access. If your children need help to make ends meet its nice to k owes you can definitely assist them but the long run you can help them more by not spending it. Also it allows them to become independent and learn to fail. Failure is part of most success stories. 
It sounds like you already have a decent career. Why spend it if your already somewhat enjoying your life.
Depending on how good your life is now and what you want to do?

Or find a way to make it small enough and have manufacturers build it into phones.
Build an open standard so if competitors want to do the same they can and all devices can talk to one another. 
Then maybe You could feasibly do a fairly long distance bitcoin transaction without internet.

Cool, so is all that information you provided an overall positive thing?

I believe it's legit. That being said, do not leave bitcoins on an exchange.

@_date: 2015-04-16 21:56:58
If it can happen, it will happen, and anything can happen, it is simply a matter of is it capable of happening right now. You should of seen this coming decades ago (exaggeration). I guess what I find funny is how people lash out and are shocked at the regulations they read. Bitcoin is an inherent right, free trade is an inherent right, just keep fighting for that. So yes we should keep fighting, especially some of those undefined provisions in the first draft, they were ridiculous.
I am for less government and less regulation. However, I do believe that some geographic locations regulating bitcoin, could increase the speed of adoption. I don't believe that it is required though. There are institutions such as the BMO Bank of Montreal (Large Canadian Bank) that have stated their interest in bitcoin however are waiting for regulation. Im sure there are others like it. For many big businesses they simply want a legal framework to work around, to know that regulators will work with them. At least thats what they say. You also have the aspect of clueless people that only take things seriously when they watch "Fox News" and see "Bitcoin is now regulated by the Government"
I know, you don't want bitcoin to be handled by banks and have their ideologies, but in the long run, it won't.
@_date: 2018-07-27 04:37:30

I want to make another point. In another thread some said. We don't need government, the governments drove the price down in the first place, by banning it or arresting people etc etc. While that may be partly true, I have to say, what did you expect, governments always get involved in money. It would be naive to think to expect them not to get involved. It would have been nice if China never made a fuss about Bitcoin. It would be nice if Charlie shrem never got arrested.

One way which openbazaar will really come in handy is in countries that want to make illegal bitcoin transactions.
If you are a seller on Amazon.ca (Canada let's say) and canada takes a negative view on bitcoin and basically says Amazon.ca is not allowed to accept bitcoin then you can always rely on open bazaar.
You first need bitcoin to be popular and useful before anyone cares. I think we will get there.

We always try and tell people what we think they will get the most immediate use out of something new.  In bitcoins case they tried to push it to people and corporations saying why you will save money on transactions. Who doesn't want to save money, right. 
It promises cheap transactions but doesn't deliver, currently. 
The real reason you should be interested in bitcoin is because it's outside one specific countries economy and because it gives you some power over control of your money back. You now have an option to secure your wealth not in your countries inflationary currency, it looks promising to be a gold 2.0 (a store of value)
It's also a good investment if you think the world will run more autonomously in the future. Bitcoin is money for computers.

Hardware wallets like the trezor.
If you want to use a hot wallet for small amounts I would say that a mobile wallet with a secure element would be a secure enough for nominal amounts. Like the galaxy s10.
@_date: 2015-02-03 22:17:17
Use a passwors you can't forget. You can even write a clue on the paper wallet like "my dogs nickname (no capitals, no spaces)". It is human nature to forget passwords!
The password is just an extra bonus. The paper wallet should be secure even with out a password if initially done correctly (using ubuntu etc)
Coinkite makes a multisignature I have never tried and green address with a Trezor should have extremly high hot wallet security

As someone who has managed to get about 18 people into Bitcoin by discussing it, I definitely have an opinion. 
You have got to sell them on 1. Why it will potentially be worth money (what it's useful for right now, and what it might potentially he useful for in the future) then work your way into how it works.
And no I haven't watched your video yet.
@_date: 2015-02-18 01:07:09
Please don't speak as if you have everything figured out of you don't know the basics.
VISA can be reversed for month/s
Try reversing 6 confirmations with Bitcoin. That's about 60 minutes. You can do less or more confirmations depending on how large the transaction is. Maybe one day it'll get faster. Maybe it won't. It's still faster then visa.

Ok really rookie here but:
Isn't there some BIP that will kill asicboost for the big miners that are blocking segwit.
Then couple that with competing crypto of ether and litecoin.
And the fact that a MB blocksize increase wouldn't solve much
And you have the recipe for segwit?
@_date: 2019-05-12 04:24:45
They did as far as I am aware. You have to download the wallet app from the store but it utilizes the secure element (chip, hardware inside the phone) as a wallet kind of like a trezor but not as good. Very good for hot wallets though. Defenetly positive and useful.

So it seems everybody is pretty sure you can't have an unlimited blocksize at this point. So even going to say 4mb we would quickly get filled up. If you want some sane fees where everyone can use it on the daily I wouldn't really say that's blockstream fault. 
So yeah there's that
