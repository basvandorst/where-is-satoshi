I just sent money via paypal “friends and family” to a friend last night literally within seconds on our mobile phones to pay for a drink I bought at a bar.  The bar had a $10 minimum and I only wanted one drink.  He offered to put it on his tab and I could pay him instead to save the minimum drink fee.
I sent it, literally about two seconds later he said he got the notification email it was was received on his phone.  That service was 100% free and was honestly easier and faster than sending crypto.  Actually I even thought to myself, crypto can’t compete with that because of the longer block times.  So like anything —- it depends...

Horrible video

 is 100% right!
Don’t accept that much bitcoin as a newb.  It’ll likely not end well.  Get the payment in Cash, or mostly cash and partial bitcoin.

Look at Square’s Cash App.  You can buy bitcoin though that.

No bitcoin can process 7 transactions per seconds. Visa is tens of thousands per second.
Lightning network is supposed to make bitcoin faster using trusted peers but in current form—-not even remotely close to Visa capability.

When you think about it, this sort of proves why bitcoin won’t work as a currency.  We are already down to like 16 million right?  Because of lost wallet private keys?  Where does that end?  Just keep dividing it into smaller numbers?  Nobody wants to pay .00000000045 for something.
They need a way to revoke lost coin and return it to be mined as new coin.  The logistics of that I have no idea.

Devils advocate.   If the whole world goes back to the Stone Age Gold still has value.  Bit Coin does not.

You got it so very backwards.  Trumps actions will increase the value of the US dollar relative to other currencies.   Unemployment is at record lows.  Our stock market is at record highs.  He’s cut corporate taxes and they are hiring again with the extra money they have.  He’s tough on businesses that are trying to leave the US for cheaper labor overseas.  He’s surprisingly adept at foreign policy.  See Syria and North Korea and Russia interactions.  He is putting America, his own county, first.  He’s put conservative judges in place that stand for the silent majority of Americans opinion and values.  He’s calling out the lifetime do nothing politicians and the liberals who oppose American values.   He’s put Obamacare on a path to self destruction (that’s a good thing).   
I don’t know that i appreciate his character as a moral compass, but so far he’s doing an incredible job as a conservative president!

What tax implications does this have?

There are 1800 Bitcoins mined each day.  If these aren’t in demand, they slowly decrease value of BTC.  If these are in demand they slowly increase the price of BTC.  Big jumps or falls in price that happen same day  are usually or at least can be coordinated buys and sells by large quantity BTC holders sometimes known as whales.  They may be “playing” the market, or they may be just adjusting their positions.

He doesn’t really care.  The idea is that if importing goods with new taxes makes foreign goods prices go up then it opens up opportunities to bring back work —- American jobs to American citizens.     He’s a nationalist.   
Surprise!!! He’s doing what’s best for his own country and stopping the loose subsidies of other countries.  Something, that Obama miserably failed to do.

It’s not accurate info
I’ve earned over a bitcoin mining on nicehash since last June/July in the US and no way I’ve spent over $2k on electricity.    Our power here is .06 per kw hour in the winter and .14 kw/h in the summer.
@_date: 2018-03-28 23:16:22
Start with nicehash.  You can sell hashing power to interested buyers.  You won’t mine bitcoin directly but you’ll be paid in bitcoin.  With a single Vega, you’ll never earn a bitcoin — ever.  Because the card will be obsolete in ~ 2 years = long before you’ve made a bitcoin.  You’ll make USD  $1.50 a day equivalent gross or so right now —- and profits will decrease over time..

Newegg let’s you buy with bitcoin.
You could also buy gift cards to your favorite store with bitcoin.

It is safe, but it isn’t regulated.  Assume every one  has an angle.  There’s no chargebacks so if someone scams you and you pay...the money is gone.  Buy a hardware wallet and keep your money there.  (Trezor or Nano S).

I see a hypnotist visit in your future 
Better make sure the hypnotist is trustworthy.

Ah.  I stand corrected.  I misread that left most value as 2001 which doesn’t even make sense on the bitcoin timeline.  My bad.
@_date: 2018-07-16 21:49:11
You scale is wrong.  Look at the dates on the x axis.   1/4 of the white space is left.  But it’s only 2 years left —not five (1/4 of the charts timeline)
Misleading yet again.

They used to plastic wrap them but they stopped plastic wrapping them, stop spreading misinformation.   They are that confident in their devices.   Ledgers own site and documentation states you’ll be safe if you regenerate your own new keys even on a previously used device.  Watch the videos on ledgers website for instruction.

You are a dope.  If this isn’t a troll post and you just actually bought zilliqa on a fake recommendation from another shrill.
Sell your crypto. Pay off your debts.
Only invest money you can afford to lose in this sector.
And don’t forget you owe taxes on all your trades.
@_date: 2018-04-15 16:35:38
I asked some of my buddies. 3 that have ordered since January say no plastic wrap, but only one of those three was direct from ledger.  1 says plastic wrap, direct from ledger.  So 50/50 split?  Maybe ledger has old stock with plastic wrap?
@_date: 2018-04-15 13:35:45
That says if you generate a new seed you’ll be safe.

Digital scarcity is not a valid strength IMO.
Perl was once a very promising programming language, it’s now dead.  It’s now scarce and no longer  valuable, (even though it still works) because it got replaced with better languages, and everyone moved their development efforts to newer more promising languages.
Point being— Bitcoin could become both scarce and worthless.  —Unlike Gold.
Digital Scarcity is a weak promotional characteristic in light of BitCoins other strengths.
