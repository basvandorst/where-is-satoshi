 My concern is if there's some way to link one address with the other if they all are created from the same seed.
 Yeah I know, but I want to build my own wallet software

That's what I'm trying to avoid. I'm trying to find a way to make it impossible for the hacker to change the MultiSig generation.

Got it, thanks!

Trade goods as in I sell a TV for 2.1 BTC?

They act as an escrow, in case of conflict they intervene. That's why they use 2-3 multisig.

Thank you for your comments. 
- Would you consider using MultiSigna if we allow adding unlimited bitcoin addresses?
- Yes, we only count banking days.
- We are working on translating the site
Thank you

Following your new README instructions it did send a raw TX, but it seems something with the fee went wrong:
I sent 9000 Satoshis and got a FEE of -0.1765 BTC

Thanks for the reply, but I still get the same message:
cat private.key | sx sign-input txfile 0 $(echo dup hash160 [ $(cat private.key | sx pubkey) ] equalverify checksig | sx rawscript)
Usage: sx rawscript [ARGS]...
Usage: sign-input FILENAME N SCRIPT_CODE
It seems rawscript is the problem, is this syntax correct?
cat private.key | sx sign-input txfile.tx 0 $(echo dup hash160 [ $(cat private.key | sx pubkey) ] equalverify checksig | sx rawscript 1 [ $(cat private.key | sx pubkey) ])


@_date: 2013-08-07 07:38:25
When running cat private.key | sx-sign-input txfile.tx 0 I get the following error: 
Usage: sign-input FILENAME N SCRIPT_CODE 
Any ideas?
