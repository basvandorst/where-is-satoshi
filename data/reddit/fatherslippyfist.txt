I wonder if the lower volume after the first of the year has to do with the new tax laws for 2018.   Trading is now a huge tax headache.

There is not really a way to address it other than just not letting data be stored on the blockchain, which kills most use cases.   How would you even go about it?   data can be stored in so many formats.  there are legitimate reasons to add urls in the blockchain.   also, the content pointed to by links can be changed after they've already been committed.  
The blockchain is immutable by design and you can't change that without destroying the entire purpose of the blockchain.

Really, all you have to do is put yourself in their place.  The had most of their BTC stolen.   It's been tied up for 5+ years in court.   Now, imagine they get a windfall out of nowhere, a bunch of coins worth 20x+ what they paid for them in a market that *may* be over inflated.  Of course I'm not saying every single person will sell, but if you don't think a *huge* percentage aren't going to say to themselves it's time to get out while the getting is good, then not sure what to tell you.   Most of them are going to rush to sell and take their windfall before everyone else does.  It's going to be a stampede.

Well, the first thing is that the initial sale was to cover the initial investment in fiat.   Whether the remaining gets paid back to investors is up to Civil Rehabilitation proceedings.  In that case, the remainder of the 20% or whatever they have could be paid out in bitcoin, or sold on the market and paid in fiat.   If civil rehab doesn't happen, then the shareholders of the exchange will get it.  In any case, I imagine most of that BTC is going to be dumped on the market.  Best case scenario for uninvolved people would be that the BTC is sold OTC and paid out to investors.  Even that will likely depress the market somewhat, but probably not as badly as just dumping it on an exchange.

How the hell are you going to blame a market wide correction that's been going on for a month on a GDAX scheduled maintenance?   Asinine.

He sold enough to pay back the investors their original investments in fiat.   There is nothing legally stopping him from continuing to sell.  He is the bankruptcy trustee and has authority to safeguard the value of the investment any way he sees fit.   And even if eventually the investors are paid the rest in bitcoin, they will immediately dump it on the market en masse, no question.

Have to agree with the other guy.   This is the dumbest shit I've ever read.  
Watching this crash and all the dumb rationalizations for it, I'm beginning to realize, most crypto investors are literally the dumbest people on the planet.

He's the trustee of the bankruptcy.   Sold enough to pay restitution at $400/coin from what I understand.   Now there is a question about what will happen with the rest.   It may go back to Mt. Gox claimaints in something called 'Civil Rehabilitation'.  If that happens, I imagine many of them will sell, probably cratering the price.

So, the internet was a much more revolutionary innovation than crypto with further reaching implications.  That bubble burst in 1999.  NASDAQ was at a high of about 6900.   It JUST reached that level again last year I think.   It took almost two decades to get back to the starting point.
I have no doubt that crypto will be a real thing, but the current levels aren't coming back anytime soon.

Give me a break.   It's been dropping like a rock for a month and every day the reddit geniuses have some brilliant explanation based around 'FUD'.   When are people going to just accept that it shot up way too fast, and once it couldn't rise anymore, the big investors started taking their profits.   Right now, they're cashing out and just eating all the money fools put in the market at the top and laughing all the way to the bank.

I think what I meant was clear in context.

You guys are ridiculous.

This India explanation is the biggest load of crap I've ever seen.  Such denial.   Sorry, this has not one single thing to do with India as you'll see when it just keeps tanking over the next weeks.

None of this has anything to do with nefarious bankers, sorry.   Maybe you also noticed the absolutely insane run up the last few months?   This is really simple.  The bubble is popping in slow motion.  Most likely it will go down a hell of a lot more before it finds a reasonable price and starts the *sloooow* march back up

This was already posted.
It was also already ripped apart.
Please, just stop.

Is he being sued?  I haven't seen the evidence of that, but maybe I missed it.  A link would be appreciated.
I doubt they'll win though.
