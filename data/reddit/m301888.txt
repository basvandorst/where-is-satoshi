@_date: 2016-01-27 18:27:17
This one does.
@_date: 2016-01-23 15:55:51
Then go back to r/btc where everyone agrees with you
@_date: 2016-03-16 13:50:36
Out of the dozens of projects James has started, MGW is the only thing he's finished (which still doesn't work after two years). 
The money you've invested in his NXT assets is gone. At some point you're going to have to accept the fact that you've been scammed.

How high do you think fees will get before Antpool stops mining empty blocks?
@_date: 2016-01-11 04:27:58
All joking aside, what's the purpose of announcing an announcement?
@_date: 2017-03-22 04:12:46
Give them enough time and rope and they'll hang themselves.

If Bitcoin can't survive Roger Ver then this entire project has been a waste of time, effort, and money.

Piss off Hear3n. No one cares.

@_date: 2016-01-13 17:57:55
I'm not implying anything. What I'll state very clearly is that Reddit comments have little or no influence over the development of Bitcoin. Neither do YouTube comments, eBaums World, 4chan, etc. 
@_date: 2016-03-08 18:21:29
How's he doing in the primaries?
@_date: 2017-03-04 18:38:10
How does that help adoption?
@_date: 2017-03-07 16:44:54
 What difference does it make whether he's incompetent or a liar?
@_date: 2016-01-25 22:37:06
This entire poster feels like Buttcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-13 16:31:45
He announced he's going to make an announcement.
@_date: 2017-02-21 03:40:27
Wouldn't the 5% fork be mining three and four hour blocks? How is that tenable?
Is my math even correct? I just multiplied ten minutes by 20
@_date: 2017-03-22 22:09:43
If BU forks it will fail. And it will feel so good to watch it burn.
@_date: 2017-03-07 16:52:26
Let him go split up the Dash community. Good riddance. 
@_date: 2016-01-23 14:50:37


Really? We wouldn't be having this conversation if what I'm describing wasn't currently taking place.

@_date: 2017-03-20 12:50:21
You don't actually want evidence. You're just regurgitating this month's talking points
@_date: 2016-01-15 19:12:38
Bitcoin is a resilient mother fucker.
@_date: 2016-03-08 18:32:36
He makes excellent points. But it sounds like he's been drinking for a while.
@_date: 2017-03-07 01:27:53
You don't store coins, only private keys.
@_date: 2016-01-15 18:11:29
Holy shit. Anyone still think Hearn had Bitcoin's best interest at heart the past few months? 
@_date: 2017-03-22 04:10:08
[serious] BU supporters - If this isn't enough to lose your support, what will it take?
@_date: 2016-03-02 23:54:44
OMG!  IT'S ALL OVER! I'M LIVING A NIGHTMARE SCENARIO!
@_date: 2017-03-31 16:31:49
Terrible analogy.
@_date: 2016-01-13 16:59:56
Barry is a great guy. But the pre-announcement hype was unnecessary.

I had a friend who wanted to use Bitcoin, but when he tried to send he got a message saying "too many memes on r/bitcoin"
@_date: 2017-03-06 00:13:48
I'm in. Let's do it. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 00:42:37
He's not even in the building.
@_date: 2016-01-25 22:46:49
Core doesn't need to smear Bitcoin Classic. Your developers are doing a fine job on their own.
@_date: 2017-03-25 00:09:19
A lot of them are altcoin pumpers and buttcoiners. This just wets their appetite.
@_date: 2016-01-09 14:24:39
I calls it a sling blade
@_date: 2016-01-27 21:39:47


Why would the average person want to use cryptocurrency at merchants when they already have debit/credit cards and cash? I'm being serious, why? Is that all you see Bitcoin as, a replacement for payment cards?
@_date: 2017-02-08 18:53:26
The entire dip was probably shorts.
@_date: 2017-03-07 13:31:50
Bigger blocks bruh. Dude. What's a block?
@_date: 2016-01-27 18:48:07
What do you think Core is doing? They're working to make Bitcoin as efficient and effective as possible.
@_date: 2016-01-18 12:07:51
I hope Hearn's new friends at R3 are as loyal to him as he was to us.
@_date: 2016-03-28 17:07:58
@_date: 2017-03-02 10:55:56
They have a way with words. It's called lying.
@_date: 2016-01-27 19:33:45
Sure, there are a lot of intelligent people on Reddit. There is also a lot of this:
*"I heard like, 1MB is not enough so like, 2MB would be better and 20MB would be ultra-rad. So like don't block the stream bra. Oh yeah, and like, if I wasn't being censored, my opinions would like totally change the world."* 
@_date: 2016-01-21 22:33:00


Look at the user names again.
@_date: 2016-01-15 19:17:10
It looks like Hearn had to prove his loyalty to the banks before joining R3. Like initiation into a gang, or the mafia.
@_date: 2017-03-07 01:21:59
I thought it was terabyte blocks.
@_date: 2017-03-26 00:57:24
Not everyone who supports BU wants to see Bitcoin fail, but everyone who wants to see Bitcoin fail supports BU.

Almost all medical professionals are in favor of vaccinations. That's much nicer than saying the anti-vaccination crowd is stupid.
@_date: 2017-03-04 13:00:35


The domain name amazon.com is worth billions. That must blow your mind. 
Besides, the "money" in your checking account is digital data stored in someone else's database, which is editable by the bank (or hackers). The history of the Bitcoin Blockchain cannot be rewritten by anyone. 
@_date: 2017-03-22 16:20:37
That's the response I would expect from an Obama lover. Why don't you get Donna Brassiere to help you cheat?
(See how easy that is?)

I would be surprised if there are actually 1,000 active Bitcoin Reddit users combined.
@_date: 2017-03-07 02:49:08
Ask yourself why thousands of Reddit users aren't trying to tell medical equipment engineers how to build an MRI machine.

No, but I don't say "millidollars" either.

Sounds fishy
@_date: 2016-01-19 22:32:28
They clearly have Bitcoin's best interest at heart. It's ridiculous to claim otherwise.

The royal we, man, the editorial.

PwC and Blockstream are using Bitcoin. R3CEV is building a competitor. 
@_date: 2017-02-26 18:40:31
Some of r/btc's most active and upvoted users are either from r/buttcoin or are altcoin investors. Why do you think that is?
@_date: 2017-03-26 03:15:16
r/btc I've got your back. Let me go ahead and cover your talking points so you don't have to:
* Where is your evidence?
* something something Trump
* bla bla bla Clinton
* I supported SegWit until this post
* This is the reason this subreddit sucks now
* Satoshi's vision
* You are all delusional
* my.freeSppeech is sin soared
@_date: 2017-03-25 18:12:16
And if you're heavily invested in altcoins, or a Buttcoiner who just enjoys contributing to Bitcoin's demise... do use Antpool.
@_date: 2016-01-23 13:54:43
Why not fork a version that sends an unlimited amount of free coins to new users? I'm sure millions of people would get on board.
Better yet. Let's just fork a version with a subtle change (let's say the block size limit). Then once we control the code everyone is running, we can do whatever we want.
@_date: 2016-01-31 01:44:54
Nailed it
@_date: 2016-01-21 00:05:48
A one-day rise in price is just as irrelevant as Mike Hearn's immature pity party.

Holy shit this is confusing. If someone holds Mycelium Token, do they need to move it somewhere else?
@_date: 2016-01-18 21:03:35
A better analogy: they want 100 gallon fuel tanks that could cause the vehicles to explode. 
@_date: 2016-01-09 14:44:07
Miners won't go for this.

Let's just call it a scam.

I'm sure they'll find another buzzword to wave around to get that sweet funding. Maybe something involving robots, or genetic engineering.
@_date: 2016-03-05 06:12:46
Bitcoin is powerful technology. Every government on the planet has a responsibility to (at least try to) control or destroy it. 
Even if the CIA isn't behind this attack, they're certainly watching with interest.
@_date: 2017-03-26 01:24:14
jstolfi (the infamous Buttcoiner) is something of a folk hero in r/btc for his Core bashing, when he's not begging the SEC to deny the Bitcoin ETF.
Show me one Buttcoiner who has supported SegWit.
@_date: 2017-03-26 01:16:13
I love how altcoins like Dash brag about how their development and community is drama-free. But once they get to a high enough market cap, greed and hunger for power always takes over. Look into what happened to the founders of Ripple.
@_date: 2016-01-28 16:25:09
And of course they'll demand a hard fork that un-caps the maximum number of bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-03-17 13:10:27
Bitcoin's simplicity is one of its strengths. There are a million ways a digital currency can fail. And when your superfly, rock 'em sock 'em, bleeding-edge altcoin reaches a high enough market cap, it will start to draw attention. Bad attention. The bugs are there. Your bug bounty program just ins't big enough to find them yet.
Cool shit will be built on top of Bitcoin, relying on the security of Bitcoin's boring old tried-and-true foundation.
@_date: 2016-01-23 15:21:21
I didn't realize miners did a line-by-line audit of the code.

"But according to at least one Bitcoin insider, the entire Bitcoin house of cards is about to collapse."
Seriously, Hearn, you are a real piece of shit.

This interview was the opposite of sexist. This is what it feels like to be treated like an ordinary person, rather than getting preferential treatment because of the way you look.

In order to secure your funds, you need to have some understanding of what you're securing. There are no "Bitcoins" that a user stores somewhere; there is only a shared ledger of transactions. What the user stores is the private keys used to sign transactions, and those private keys can be recreated from the mnemonic seed even if their device is lost/stolen/destroyed. If the keys are stored on a computer or phone they can be stolen by malware. 
tl;dr If I could offer only one piece of advice to a new Bitcoin user it would be this: get a hardware device like a Trezor and memorize the mnemonic seed.
@_date: 2016-06-17 13:40:09

* It's just as easy to fill 2MB blocks with garbage as it is 1MB. Meaning blocks will always be full. 
* Some miners prefer to mine empty blocks. So it doesn't matter what size they are.
* Larger blocks makes running a full node even more of a pain in the ass.

I'm so sick of this bullshit. The current hashrate is around 1.5 exahashes per second. That kind of security isn't instantaneous and it sure as shit isn't free. If you need free and close-to-instant transactions, use an altcoin. Otherwise, STFU!

I don't know whether OP is serious or not. But I believe this is the way most people see Bitcoin: an unnecessary proxy for "real" money. If such a small percentage of people comprehend the value of a borderless, programmable store of value, imagine how undervalued it still is.

Bitcoin gets a ton of attention (good and bad) when the price goes vertical. It's nice to see people get involved because they're interested in the technology.
Trezor is arguably the best choice for securing your funds. When you set up the account and it gives you the list of words (the seed) write them down. Memorize them if you can. But **do not** type them into a computer or phone. The seed should never be stored in digital form if you plan on keeping a significant amount of money in the account. PM me if you need any help.

Look at the chart. The 2013 run up was a fluke. This rise has been slow and steady (until the past couple of weeks), with plenty of consolidation along the way.
