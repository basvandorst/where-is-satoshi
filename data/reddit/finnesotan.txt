Well, it kind of is. You say the number of people are buying and using is increasing but it hasn't really over the past 6 months

Actually, in the three months ending August 17th, 2017 the number of transactions decreased 7.3% from the three months prior.

Well yeah but how do you define what it should be valued at..?
Say I buy a candy bar for 50 Cents from a store down the street and price it at $1 in my store. The next day I mark it down to 70 Cents. Is it still worth a dollar because that's what it was priced at yesterday? Or is it actually worth the 50 cents I paid? 
The answer is it's worth whatever the market is willing to pay.

My question/point is: What do you look at to justify its valuation? Just because something is listed at a certain price does not justify it's value. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 20:32:52
At a discount to what? How do you value the currency?

Besides its value being 30+% higher last week, what makes it of good value today?

I don't think a majority of crypto investors understand much about the tech or what they're even investing in, especially when they get in to alt coins or ICO's. 
All many seem to talk about is price, not the composition of the underlying.

Yeah I know that's clearly why everyone has been hyping up crypto. But what do you actually look at to show that it is being adopted instead of just being used as an investment vehicle? 
Like why is it 300% more valuable that it was a few months ago? Did it become 300% more likely that this would be universally adopted? Did transactions spike 300%?

Haha! A+ Response

Fast forward to 3 months ending yesterday and the number of transactions dropped 16.8% relative to the three months prior. 
I understand how economics work but how do you address the scalability issue? Only a finite amount of transactions can fit into a 1MB block even if there were transaction growth.
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:54:07
But there is negative transaction growth. Although volume (people making bigger bets / investments in terms of USD) is up, the actual number of transactions is declining. Which hasn't happened since 2014 by my model. 
I agree that it is all about where the value is found and I respect all those that are hodl right now or buying to lower their cost basis. Those people in the long run will be rewarded 9 times out of 10. Although I would hate to have crypto exposure on a week like this. 
I just believe that crypto has been a huge circle jerk of greed the past few months so this was bound to happen.

No it is not speculation, in theory both of those could drop 50% in the next month. Standard deviation suggests it is more likely to occur for bitcoin than the S&amp;P 500 (this is not saying either *will happen*, therefore it isn't speculation).
50% was not a probability.. it was in response to your 'halving' comment, which I now realize was referring to the mining reward
@_date: 2018-12-13 02:50:22
Nothing is stopping it from dropping 50% in the next month. Just like how nothing is stopping the S&amp;P 500 from doing the same.
However one of those is more likely than the other.

I edited what I said, I misunderstood. You misunderstood my first comment as well - I did not intend to speculate nor was there a proverbial disclaimer.
