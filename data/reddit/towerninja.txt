Ledger is the nano s. Bitpay Won t support it anymore because chrome isn't offering support to non chrome os systems. So unless you have a chromebook you can't use ledger to pay anyone on bitpay

Log in to gdax and do the transaction from there no fee
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:07:15
Not feeding the beast. The beauty of bitcoin is keeping your money out of the banking system. It's a revolution, a statement that you are doing your part. To stop the banks from bleeding us dry
@_date: 2018-01-23 02:10:30
Okay the only one I didn't know was 
@_date: 2018-01-01 03:54:08
That's assuming everyone made gains
@_date: 2018-01-02 22:38:06
Actually it's bitcoins problem because it's making it hard to use bitcoin
@_date: 2018-01-02 22:55:37
Apparently it has to support bitcoin protocol payment whatever the he'll that is
@_date: 2018-01-23 00:26:21
You're a little behind the curve. People have been talking about the day one satoshi= one dollar for a long time

When will they have a stand alone app now that there's no support on chrome?

Buy and sell orders. People set automatic buys and sells. If you're selling too high and no one is buying you drop the price

Bitpay not compatible with hardware wallets
@_date: 2018-01-07 12:39:16
It's much more nefarious than this
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:46:31
Interestingly everything in nature follows Fibonacci or the golden ratio. Markets have often seemed to follow these patterns. The thinking is the collective humanity involved also follows these numbers
@_date: 2018-01-07 12:50:52
I did it twice in the past two weeks
@_date: 2018-01-18 12:59:34
I leave it on the exchange until a certain amount for a few reasons. When my holdings on exchange break a thousand I move it to my hardware wallet. One of my main reasons. Starting 1/1/2018. Bitpay doesn't accept payments via a ledger s. For some reason electrum won t work with my ledger either. So if I'm buying from someone using bitpay. I'll move it from the exchange to my desktop wallet. Then pay. From there
@_date: 2018-01-02 01:55:21
You could have transferred to gdax for free and sold on gdax
@_date: 2018-01-10 22:19:01

I wanted to get into bitcoin 3 years ago. I didn't understand it well enough so I didn't get in until the middle of 2017. I have to think a lot of people that were the same
@_date: 2018-01-02 22:56:40
I'm sending bitcoin. But some bullshit about protocol payments. I ordered from the same place two weeks ago no issue
@_date: 2018-01-02 23:14:19
Because I don't want a bunch of different wallets
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:59:34
I should add. His thinking is flawed. We don't know if it's going up or down. It can retract to the lower fib level. Then go up from there or vice versa. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 13:27:01
I read an article yesterday that said expect to see bitcoin derivative products in 2018
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:45:24
Good point. But I did use btc more than I used actual cash
@_date: 2018-01-02 22:24:23
Lmao I didn't post it but probably because they didn't know the actual name
@_date: 2018-01-07 14:49:15
Because the CEO of coinbase surprised launched bcash and has been talking shit on bitcoin ever since. He is pumping bcash
@_date: 2018-01-05 20:54:55
Log in to gdax with your coinbase info. Deposit your bitcoin from coinbase. Thats instant and free. Then spend it from gdax and gdax covers the fee
@_date: 2018-01-13 10:13:51
It's just a commemorative round/coin no value

Maybe he's a computer
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:30:50
That's exactly what I'm talking about
@_date: 2017-12-25 11:45:58
Gdax pays the fee
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:22:51
Yeah I actually posted about that the other day and got down voted. I didn't realize I could transfer in for free as well though, I plan on just leaving spending coin on coinbase. I recently pulled it all out to a ledger though
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:42:18
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:40:39
I didn't bother reading the article. But I'm assuming it's talking about silvers rise to 50bucks in the 80s. That's a totally different scenario. It was caused by the Hunt brothers. They literally cornered the market raising prices. They got busted and it crashed
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:48:50
Well I made a post yesterday. Pointing out you can spend through gdax and not pay fees
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:30:16
People are going to do what saves them money. Would you pay 30 dollars for something worth 15? Using gdax as a hot wallet is a way around that, I'm all for what bitcoin stands for that doesn't obligate me to throw money away
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:07:25
This is good advice. Though when you are ready you can move it to a hardware wallet. With no fees through gdax
@_date: 2017-12-17 10:50:41
How the f! did Trump get elected yet Ron  never did? Ugh 'merica
Edit: spelling
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:49:32
I been pulling my money out of the banking system before bitcoin was around. That doesn't mean I should be stupid with my money
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:25:03
I think it will end where it started. As a fiat alternative
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:27:37
No idea but you can log on to gdax. Using your coinbase I'D transfer from coinbase to gdax then from gdax to your wallet for free
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:53:04
It did show up unconfirmed instantly thank you
@_date: 2017-12-17 10:42:11
The 30 to 60 age group. Is most likely attracted to the idea of separating from Central banks. When I first heard of bitcoin that is what appealed to me. A way out if the fractional reserve system

Sorry didn't see this sooner. But yes or a hand held one
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:05:40
Really leave some chump change for purchases on a insured exchange is stupid? That's a stupid thing to say as it's a second or third place to keep your coins
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:09:40
Gonna say it again. Keep some coins for spending on coinbase/gdax. Take advantage of the fact they cover the fee
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:06:04
You're young with plenty of time. You already learned some valuable life lessons some people never get. You'll be a better person because of it, I'm an average lower middle class construction worker. That spent more than half my life as a ghetto fuck. I get it

It will continue to be a store of value until it stabilizes. Then it can be used as a currency.

About 10 days ago
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:34:47
I never really understand that statement myself
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:42:05
None the less it is awesome they are insured. It made/makes me comfortable leaving a certain amount on the exchange before I move it to my wallet
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:25:25
I'd rather use it as my way of helping it catch on more then replenish
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:33:44
"In the black"
Red= loss
Black= gains
@_date: 2017-12-31 04:06:47
I agree. Use it even if you immediately buy more to replace what you spent

He's the only one to ever really call out the fed
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:07:50
That's a hurt piece for sure. But likely you would have sold somewhere along the line. Take it as a lesson to make backups.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:07:33
You're starting with the wrong mentality. Usually an indicator of weak hands. Which leads to losses

Futures contracts are settled in dollars. People don't need any bitcoin at all to trade futures
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:24:12
No that's part of the reason they froze it
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:47:37
That's a good plan
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:40:00
I have some eth. I bought at around 280. I thought it was a good idea with some serious big player interest. But it's not in competition with bitcoin. It's not meant to be a currency like bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-19 03:16:30
The dollar operates on fractional reserve. Meaning if you get a mortgage. You printed that money. It didn't exsist until you asked for it. The act of borrowing brings it into existence. Expanding the money supply thus devaluing it. Once the rest of the world works around the swift payment system and stops using the dollar as the reserve currency. All the countries holding dollars for trade will dump them back here. Causing massive hyperinflation
@_date: 2017-12-16 05:42:28
I would argue it needs to rise more as a store of value. Then stabilize at much higher rates. To then be a true global currency with power to dethrone the fed
@_date: 2017-12-25 11:49:19
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:22:16
That was kind of my point. I am doing fine. But because of where I came from I can empathize with people who have all kinds of issues and I'm comfortable anywhere I may be
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:27:16
Did you upload your ID to coinbase?
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:21:22
Yes it is
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:18:12
You can buy almost anything with it, if you're into silver go over to r/pmsforsale maybe someone there will ship to Europe
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:08:09
Send from gdax
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:30:08
You have to send from gdax though
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:08:46
It kept me comfortable to a point. I'm willing to leave 1 or 2 thousand dollars on coinbase. Above that I'm not too sure
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:54:15
The end game is hopefully. A new global system where bitcoin is The new reserve currency. So no this is not correct. However it's possible
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:36:17
Meritocracy!! 
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:11:38
This. The transfer to gdax is free and instant
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:35:21
I spent what I was willing to lose. So I don't plan on ever "cashing out" I do spend bitcoin and then replenish what I spent
@_date: 2017-12-19 03:11:37

I know, I was just curious if it was considerably faster through coinbase. I'll probably go through gdax
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:25:25
Where do I find these debit cards?
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:56:22
It's not a set up sell wall. It's just that a lot of people set up automatic sells at that price

Thank you

Copy that thanks
@_date: 2017-12-29 16:59:13
Okay so I moved my coins from gdax to a ledger a couple weeks ago. Now what do I need to do
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:12:59
Silver ones are 30 bucks
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:26:49
My understanding is the same. Crypto losses don't count but of course the gains do
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:10:08
It's a test transaction. I sent like .0001xxx. Thanks for the advice
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:13:17
You're missing the real point of bitcoin. The actual purpose of bitcoin was never profit. It's a currency that you aren't charged for simply holding (inflation) every time a person uses any type of credit the value of your dollars decreases
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:12:57
Coinbase charged 17 for the withdraw. Gdax is free
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:43:22

Coinbase is not fdic insured. They buy insurance through a subsidiary of Lloyds of London
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:53:33
I don't know where this is from but during the Ukraine uprising couple years back. So.eone did this and received tens of thousands of dollars worth of bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:16:48
It won't but it's a big step towards fixing our screwed up fractional reserve banking system. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:30:30
At that point bitcoin is The new reserve currency. People use it for global trade
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:12:04
It's like buying gold onine and paying by check. The price us locked in when you click buy. Gold isn't sent until they receive the check and it clears. What happens in price after you click buy has no bearing on the purchase
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:50:53
You know with or without bitcoin the dollar is destined to die? Bonds haven't been paying shit since 2008. Crypto is certainly the future. It's the revolution against the bankers. Do what you want. We don't care what you do with your money. Most of the world would say it's time for this nonsense with the petro dollar to end. Stop killing people who don't want to trade in dollars
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:23:21
You're welcome. That's why the day after thanksgiving is "black Friday" it's the day most retailers books go from red to black
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:10:10
I wouldn't have argued the point that much but your one of those douche bags that uses the downvote because you don't like what was said which isn't how Reddit works. Keeping 5/10 percent of your coins on gdax to use for buying things makes sense
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:20:47
Mac's are vulnerable too
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:12:18
I did it with a test transaction. To test my wallet. It was like 3 dollars worth of bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:20:12
Abraham Lincoln as well. All be it by accident. Make no mistake the creation of the green back. Is what got Lincoln killed. The banks wouldn't fund the war effort. So he created a public owned currency. The green back. Printed by the government as opposed to a central bank
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:17:24
I don't mind the 20 bucks to send it but how do I know the difference with the ledger? I just got it today
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:49:29
I have a mac. I'm just saying they can be compromised as well. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:56:40
So now to test seed. Put in the wrong pin 3 times to reset? Then use the seed to recover?
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:44:48
Seriously though I spent some at 19. This is a good chance to reup
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:44:42
My gf keeps asking me the same. I don't do it because it don't feel right to me. They can set up their own account and wallet. I feel like if it crashes. She might think I cashed out some of hers or something. It's not like ordering gold or something where I hand it over on arrival
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:15:00
I came here to say this
@_date: 2018-05-24 19:59:00
The blockchain doesn't have my name and address. I'm aware 100 dollar bills exsist. This is a sad argument. The loss of privacy is not a good thing
@_date: 2018-05-24 23:27:49
They are reasons that traceable currency is not good
@_date: 2018-05-24 19:07:46
You must not be American. You don't see a privacy concern there?
@_date: 2018-05-24 20:00:29
Political rivalry is a powerful motivator
@_date: 2018-05-24 19:45:30
To answer the question. The dollar is easily the most transparent traceable currency. Extremely minimal transactions take place in cash anymore. So through the use if cards and checks that makes the dollar the winner in this ever so sad competition 
@_date: 2018-05-24 08:48:04
You're saying all bad stuff, but saying it like it's good
@_date: 2018-05-16 21:06:05
I like this response. Though I would like to see a Meritocracy system. To kill off these dynasty families. I totally agree with do something to earn wealth. I don't think your children should be filthy rich and therefore politically powerful off of your work
@_date: 2018-05-24 20:20:14
I agree regardless of the currency. All government spending should be transparent. It's supposed to be the people's government. It's citizens privacy should be respected though
@_date: 2018-05-24 20:17:32
I'm talking about a smaller leader. Gaining popularity. They can use his financial purchases against them. A simple example being. Maybe he's into kinky sex. The establishment exploits and exaggerates this to kill the movement. It's like a relationship. I'm not cheating. But if my gf starts reading my texts, messages, and email. I'm out it's over. The "if you don't have anything to hide" argument is not just cause to invade someone's privacy
@_date: 2018-10-21 18:54:15
Actually dash and bitcoin are the peoples choice in Venezuela. Thats what they are using

He sold at a loss. That's a write off
@_date: 2018-10-20 23:11:05
Yeah I agree. But gold has thousands of years of history. I have to think the scam will fall apart eventually. For me diversification is the best protection 
@_date: 2018-10-20 23:52:21
If though most people don't understand the need for hard money. They know this system is messed up. So yeah bitcoin is poised to do well
@_date: 2017-08-16 15:53:26
Oh yeah you're write. I don't know what I was thinking
@_date: 2017-08-16 11:57:28
I'm a total noob to bitcoin. But to me and I imagine most. If you are not day trading. Bitcoin is like gold or silver. Don't spend cash you don't have to play with and buy and hold. Go long have a sell price in mind. Don't sell short of that even in a meltdown. Also dca (dollar cost average)

What is ledger live? I have a ledger but haven't used it on over a year
@_date: 2017-11-16 01:02:00
You're looking at wrong. The way you pose the question is like you paid in bitcoin representing dollars. You paid in bitcoin end of story. If you paid 1 bitcoin you get refunded 1 bitcoin. It cuts both ways for both sides it could be a drop in price just as easy
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:04:02
I would hope the majority of people using bitcoin. Would know that this is a very real possibility and if they are the type that would get buyers remorse in this way. Just pay in dollars. Though there is a side to this I didn't really see before. I suppose if you buy something with bitcoin. You basically sold your bitcoin. So with that in mind if said party disclosed ahead of time. That refunds will be settled in dollars that would be fair enough
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:00:15
Probably. I'm sure you have done well but diversification is important. Also if your employer matches you are leaving free money on the table
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:55:31
Coinbase is insured as well. I'll move to a trezor or something when it's a sizeable amount
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:21:18
At 100k I don't know either. However at a million plus. That would mean the people of the world decided bitcoin will replace the world reserve currency
@_date: 2017-11-16 01:25:04
So the retailer gets .2 for nothing? If I buy a bike for 200 dollars and the retailer cancels but the dollar dropped 20 percent against other currencies and gold. Should I get 240 back?
@_date: 2018-03-01 23:27:40
Too many people are confused about this, the real problem with fiat. Is it is NOT issued by government. It's printed by private banks and lent to governments at interest. Something as simple as government printing and issuing it's money. Would fix so many things that are wrong in the world. The other big problem is fractional reserve banking. The extreme and simple way to explain. Is this you take out a car loan for 10k. The bank doesn't have that 10k. It gets issued through the act of you borrowing it. In effect you printed it
@_date: 2018-03-18 22:02:41
45 percent richer you say? I'm a blue collar worker. My father was a blue collar worker m, my mom was a stay at home mom. You can't do it with one income anymore. In the 80s my father was making 18 dollars an hour with a mortgage payment of 185 a month. I make 27.50 an hour with 1900 a month rent on a one bedroom apartment. We haven't got richer. Cost of living went up double or triple of wages
@_date: 2018-03-18 22:22:02
Also you removed the body of your post shortly after I commented. Because you know your full of shit
@_date: 2018-03-01 23:19:46
Dude you got it mixed up. The central bank's are private institutions. And they are above the law. Actually a lot of problems the state has. Comes from the banks. Private banks print worthless paper. Lend the paper to governments. By doing this they steal all the world's real wealth. They buy gold, silver, resources, and our labor. You need to research the money supply a little more
@_date: 2018-03-18 22:46:51
Actual banks that operate as savings and loan. Loan money to reasonable risk customers with interest. As opposed to creating the money out of the air. I actually think a lot of people wouldn't mind this system if they dropped the interest. The act of me asking the bank for 10k makes the bank 10k  charging interest is usery
@_date: 2018-03-18 23:05:50
The thing is people using bitcoin. Are fighting the system in their own small way. Even if it does not work. It's far more respectable than the approach to just bitch and cry the we can't change it
@_date: 2018-03-01 23:29:36
Can't do fractional reserve with bitcoin. Because it has a finite supply. Though you could do a savings and loan type of bank

I get by fine. I can actually get a place for 14/15 but I'm walking distance to work. So no commute cost. No gas, tolls, parking. Not to mention the time. But even at 1200 I wouldn't the level of expendable income as my father did in the 80s. I'm actually way above the norm too. 27 50 is pretty good compared to most people. So the cost of everything went up but wages did not keep up

I do work at the Federal Reserve bank of Philadelphia. It is absolutely a private bank. They have federal police working there but no one else is a federal employee because it's a private bank

Actually you are the monkey. I don't know what will happen. But if people woke up and saw the world around them we as a people could accomplish just about anything. So though not likely it is possible crypto will kill the banks. More and more people are getting it every day. If we all thought like you. Life wouldn't be worth living

We aren't richer we actually have less purchasing power

Actually this is very close to the answer. It solves the problem of us being slaves to a small group of people with the power to print their own money

You see you are an idiot. You are totally clueless. I don't live here because the area. I pay an extra 500 to live here for the time I save. The 500 would be spent either way. By living here I not only save time. I no longer pay for gas, tolls, or parking. Matter of fact I don't need a car. So I more or less gave the car to my gf. She pays the insurance. You obviously live in your own idiotic bubble

The federal reserve is a private bank

There are bitcoin loan platforms

It's usery that's the problem. Money can be whatever we agree on. If fiat currency was actually issued by the state, transparently, and interest free. It wouldn't be so bad. Obviously I'm assuming a legit democratic republic government.....

I read an article that pointed out. The dow fell 666 points on the 33rd day of 2018. If you believe conspiracy theories this is a bad sign for the dollar. If you don't believe in them it means nothing

A big flaw is you keep using the word "invest" You are leaving out a big component. The people who literally want it to use. Especially developing nations who's currency fell to shit

Stability is a good thing

It proves my bills are ten times my dad's but I don't even make double

Because it has a cap. It can't be printed/mined to infinity

I think bitcoin has the potential to be a reserve currency. A way to bypass the swift payment system. We don't really need mass adoption for this to work. Just need it to stabilize

The thing is the rest of the world will see that bitcoin is the way to beat the dollar. So that isnt likely to happen
