There is nothing new about bitcoin. It's just a form of gold standard.


and likely an idiot. I'd suggest you to check Paul Krugman. He is Nobel Prize winner in economics and has an ability to explain complex economics problems in simple accessible way. 
Or just read books that I linked.

Just like any other form of money.
You didn't explain how gold is centralized. It is just as decentralized as bitcoin (unless government would somehow put microchip in every gold coin)

Keiser is an idiot

2 systems failed. 200 others succeded.
You didn't explain how gold is centralized.

Bitcoin will be banned eventually

I'm close minded. I don't want to starve to death when banking system will collapse and tens of millions of people will become unemployed

bitcoin would be disasterous for Russia and the world

Bitcoin is a form of gold standard and gold standard caused Great Depression.
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:33:08


What does that mean? You gold coins belong only to you and only you can decide what to do with them.
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:04:05
Bitcoin will kill banks because banking system needs elastic money supply.
New Great Depression is coming!
Ban Bitcoin before it's too late!

This system is designed to keep economy at full employment.


Wages adjusted for CPI didn't fall in last 40 years.


From whom will enterpreneurs borrow money to expand their business and hire workers after collapse of banking system?
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:55:50
Ron Paul and other fixed money supply freaks.
Simply google "Paul Krugman debate"
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:56:01
bitcoin is dangerous
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:24:48
I will give you link to much better information on banking and monetary policy.
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:57:59
banks provide credit
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:07:51
You didn't answer my question. From whom will enterpreneurs borrow money to expand their business and hire workers after collapse of banking system?
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:11:25


nothing wrong with that if interest rates are low


2% CPI is not big loss
if banks would collapse from whom will you borrow money?
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:09:29
bubbles are unpredictable
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:24:05


It is the reason why bitcoin will eventually be banned.
Tens of millions of unemployed people won't simply accept death from starvation.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:22:00
How many books on macroeconomics did you read? Zero?
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:23:11


What's the difference? Money supply is fixed and government can't control interest rates just like under gold standard.

Ok I've just watched this video. It didn't answer my question so I repeat it again. From whom will enterpreneurs borrow money to expand their business and hire workers after collapse of banking system?

Almost any business requires money from lenders/investors.
