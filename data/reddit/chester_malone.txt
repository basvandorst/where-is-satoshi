Can you actually see statistics on there? If so that's hilarious

To be honest I can't answer that question. I would assume that most do due to the risk, but even then you might take a payment for $5,000 dollars and then in the next few minutes the price of BTC goes down 5%. Then you factor in things like companies that sell online. Most of those companies arent going to have someone work 24/7 to have someone that's job is simply converting BTC to USD. I am a grain merchant and we buy/futures strictly to hedge our cash purchases. If we buy corn from a customer we then in turn sell that on the CME to limit our risk. We pay a cash price to the customer which is the CME futures price plus/minus something called basis.  Basis is basically how much corn is worth in the local market place. It most soley based on demand. 
Long story short I think that companies will be able to accept bitcoin as payment and then in turn hedge their sales/purchases to alleviate their otherwise extreme risk in bitcoin price fluctuation. In that same market you will have speculators and hedge funds that will solely buy/sell based off predicted price movements

You can wire money to your coinbase account, transfer it to GDAX, and then buy BTC on GDAX for a much lower transaction fees

I think I need to stay away from the market for 36 hours. This volatility is crazy. If I didn't already have some loss on my most recent bitcoin purchase I'd man up and buy some more. I would love to buy more right now 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:38:38
Yes it does. Maybe 5-10 years from now Bitcoin will he established and some of the volatility will disappear. Regardless, if you look the example about the book one would assume that if it was worth less BTC that surrounding goods would also be devalued in regards to BTC. Yeah 5 years from now you might not be able to "invest" in bitcoin to make a 5000% profit, but that's not the point of bitcoin. Bitcoins purpose is to act like a currency
@_date: 2017-12-17 06:38:14
That's not true or even close to accurate 
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:14:23
I'm not sure what your uncle said that you disagree with to be honest. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:00:20
Fees will get cheaper. More people will adopt the technology/currency. Eventually you won't see as much hoarding. I understand the volatility is high. That's where the CME and futures trading comes into play. It will allow hedging to take place which will eliminate a lot of the volatility risks. I think bitcoin will never take over as the only currency and I don't think it should either. It should be used in connection with something like the USD
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:54:29
It would make much more sense if they exchanged the bitcoin at the end of the contract months expiration date. From the sounds if it bitcoin will be similar to the CME crude oil contracts. I believe they are cash settled too
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:54:32
Hmm...  Not really. You could buy in sell in USD but then on the contract expiration date you would receive a BTC. Anyone could buy or sell the futures even if they didn't have BTC. They would just need to be sure they exited their position by contract expiration. That's how it is done with things such as corn/soybeans. I'm not saying that'd necessarily a better way to do it, but I like the thought. Although I think all the other currency markets on the CME are cash settled 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:04:21
You're absolutely right. All these conspiracy theories are ridiculous. The price skyrocketed way too quick and this correction was more than due. These whales recognized there was a lot of profit and captured some of it. They'll buy back in. It's hilarious that all these people are convinced it was an "attack." Nobody was saying shit when the market pumped to the levels it did in a 2 week period. Does nobody on this sub read? The creator if LTC dumped all of his coins, but I'm sure that had nothing to do with it either... 
I'm sure my comment will catch some flack, but come on guys. Let's be real. BTC's growth was totally unsustainable. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:50:02
Yep this is my expectation as well. It will make the adoption of actually using bitcoin as payment much more viable. A company can't accept bitcoin but then have the price of bitcoin drop 50% the next week. It would be such an enormous risk for companies and potentially bankrupt them. Now that they have a way to mitigate that risk and stabalize their their income it makes it much more sense to actually accept it as payment. I just don't know how closely the CME and GDAX will trade. There's nothing that says the price will fluctuate at the same levels

It's painful watching this because I invested a fairly significant chunk of money into this market already. I desperately wanted to dump a bunch more cash into crypto when the price dipped as hard as they did but I just wasn't willing to risk a potential larger loss. It's tough to keep pouring money in the market when you're down a grand and a grand is a significant chunk of change to you. 
Note: I'm HODL but I did diversify my crypto portfolio more than before

Who cares what this guy says?
@_date: 2015-05-20 00:39:36
Well hey, we've got you fooled apparently since you referred to bitcoin as a currency
@_date: 2015-05-20 00:50:09
You mean the ones that have been going off and on constantly in Europe?
Yeah. I don't think that's going to happen. Also, who wants to put their life savings into a currency that is not regulated by any entity with any sort of real power or backing? The answer is no one even half way conservative. This is the problem with bitcoin. People pretty much look at it strictly as a means of making money. Practically no one views it as any sort of real currency/fiat

How do you know you're one of them? 
@_date: 2018-02-24 08:01:20
How do you know if you're one of those lucky 13,000 customers?

I'm stuck here and I can't get money wired to me from my bank. Not sure what to do
@_date: 2016-07-31 11:41:50
My thoughts exactly. This title/statement actually kind of bothered me
@_date: 2013-04-29 17:31:32
Or you could get a job that didn't rely on tips...
@_date: 2013-06-14 02:13:56
My god this wonderful
@_date: 2013-05-02 18:58:23
Too bad there are so many speculators
@_date: 2013-10-21 18:15:33
Explain it like I'm 5. How does bit coin mining work? Do these "miners" acquire free bit coins through this process?
@_date: 2013-04-17 18:42:10
Bitcoin is far to volatile. Amazon could potentially make more money by the increase in Bitcoin "stock" than the actual profit from the product itself. Or on the flip-side they could lose a shit ton of money by doing this. This is not viable for Amazon... at least for now
