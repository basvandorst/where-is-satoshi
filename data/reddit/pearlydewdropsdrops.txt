* how would you pay your property tax ? 
* collecting rainwater is illegal in most places, so you'd at least be breaking that law.
* Kill an animal without a hunting tag, and you're a poacher. 
* Erect a structure that hasn't been permitted by the county or inspected, thats a crime
* Lighting an illegal campfire is another crime depending on the area.
* Cops/game wardens/forest service routinely fly over wilderness areas looking for marijuana farms, squatters, poachers, mobile meth labs, or (people who pan for gold without a claim, not sure if claim jumpers is the right word?) So spend any amount of time outside, and you'll eventually encounter some sort of officer, at the bare minimum just to check you out and see what you're doing (better . Even if t your farm is on private property, you might be "suspected" of growing weed, and they will come out to make sure its not.
* If you pitch a tent on public lands without a camping permit, i.e. you live there, you'll eventually be discovered by a park ranger/game warden and cited for squatting, or asked to leave. Leave any belongings out could be considered dumping.
* Don't even think about commercial farming, because if you sell pork or beef, you have to have USDA certification, which means you'll have to have a huge initial investment, i.e. it's regulatory capture. Not sure about dairy products, but they could be added later.

you'd wouldn't last the winter. but maybe you could work your way up to it gradually. If I went off the grid, my bet would be to go to hawaii and scavenge off fruit trees or fish. I would even consider getting a small sail boat and living out at sea. I'm not sure how long a boat would last out there though. One leak and you're done :(
