Thanks for your comment, however I have to respectfully disagree.  The idea that I agree to capital controls as a precondition to my participation in society, enforced by the coercive authority of the state, is antithetical to the idea of a free, open, and democratic society.  I participate in society due to the collection of benefits that it delivers.  When that collection of benefits becomes negative, whether due to regulatory capture, corruption, or ideology, *and* the balance of power has tipped such that I am being regularly taken advantage of, then it is incumbent on the citizenry to redress the wrong by whatever means are at hand.  Bowing down to an unaccountable and private Federal Reserve system that can reach into my pocket anytime it likes, particularly in the context of a modern society, is unacceptable and certainly not the answer.

So the miners have slowed transaction settlements to keep a reward  value high? 
(Apologies - still learning about Bitcoin)

Privacy isn't a legal reason? I think you've overstepped a tad.

Even now Canadian banks are leery about  giving out hundreds, and will often make noises about you needing to 'order ahead of time' for even for a few thousand. It's ridiculous.
