SR sells gift certificates too. Save him the trouble.

But it's putting far too much trust into a service that is doing everything imaginable to indicate to you not to trust it.
How do you know it's being effectively laundered? Has someone done a study of the blockchain to prove this? How do you know they won't abscond with all your BTC when they reach whatever level of success makes it worthwhile to them?
It just seems terribly naive. And anyway, the chances of a government or hackers taking down a web app running over tor are far greater than the chances of either of them shutting down my brain wallet.
@_date: 2012-11-07 04:21:15
I don't understand. What purpose does using a tor hidden service wallet serve, other than to enrich its operator?
Strikes me as a horrendously bad idea.
@_date: 2012-11-07 13:18:11
No I agree with you that tor hidden services are effective at what they do - anonymizing both their users and their operators. I meant that as compared to a brain wallet a tor hidden service can still theoretically: a) be hacked (a sql injection is a sql injection over tor or clearweb) and b) be shut down by authorities. On that point I'll clarify that I don't mean by overcoming tor's encryption. That isn't necessary. All it takes is one person to snitch, one angry woman to rat out her cheating boyfriend, etc. The human element is a weakness that ought not be introduced into the equation for storing bitcoins. The current solutions are superior.

I think I'll soon be offering an anonymous cash USD hosting wallet service.
Please send your cash to my PO Box and I will totally hold onto it for you and keep it really really safe. And you can have it back whenever you want. Trust me!

Not sure if you've ever shipped much for business, but USPS is about HALF as expensive as the private delivery services (UPS/FedEx). I know people criticize the inefficiencies of the USPS, but they're dramatically cheaper and they aren't subsidized by taxpayers.

huge improvement. clean and intuitive. looks very nice now.

But if the DoS attack is a Tor network level attack as has been implied, then any Tor hidden service will be vulnerable. Nothing will stop the extortionists from DoSing alternative markets.

And even if he renounces citizenship, he'll still have to pay his taxes:
@_date: 2013-07-23 18:19:55
So he's going to work off ~~700,000~~ 193,319 BTC? Sort of like washing dishes in the back of the restaurant?
@_date: 2013-06-14 18:02:36
I would've asked him how he intends to spend his time in prison after he's prosecuted for violations of US gaming laws. (I recommend lifting weights. It can be very fulfilling.)
Edit: No disrespect to evoorhees. You're doing some great stuff, but satoshidice was a mistake. You're going to end up prosecuted for it :(
@_date: 2013-06-25 00:17:01
Probably 24 months.
@_date: 2013-07-18 20:49:53
He better not plan on coming back if that's the case. As long as he's a US citizen he still has to file a tax return.
@_date: 2013-08-13 02:25:22
Not that bad? An owner of one of these things is going to have to sell, what, $50,000 of bitcoins to recoup that? Yeah, that's reasonable...
@_date: 2013-08-13 00:48:36
Sure you can. 
[It's not feasible to do this with a deterministic wallet]( but it's easy enough with a single vanity address. 
Feed the private key to mnemonic.py, included with electrum. For example:
    C:\Program Files (x86)\Electrum\lib&gt;python mnemonic.py 146FC87D94C9CB88ECA6D3D423382F74E53256F17DD6C52D6860A174F02743BB
    suppose certainly heart sentence spiral admit million drop tree shore form image shimmer near upon threaten ice collect secret everywhere tool raise tongue edge
Note that a private key is 256 bits and makes a mnemonic twice as long (24 words) as an actual wallet seed.

don't use a hosted wallet.
@_date: 2013-07-11 23:30:22
Not familiar with this particular service, but if it's a hosted wallet run from a .onion site (tor hidden service) then it is most certainly a scam, and you have given your coins away.
@_date: 2013-04-30 20:19:55
I don't think the title is misleading. It was an open question.
I didn;t mean to imply that coins would be stolen or that BTC would suddenly drop to $0. Only that the value /will/ be effected negatively (to some unknown degree), as SR is probably the single largest real commercial use of bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-04-30 19:36:27
I agree with your assessment of why it's probably happening (an attempt at market manipulation) -- though no, I'm not the hacker. 
According to the post by Dread Pirate Roberts, the only way to deal with this attack may be to change the Silk Road into something unrecognizable, something it was never intended to be -- that is, a private site. At that point Silk Road ceases to be...
