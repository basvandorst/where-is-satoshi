Nice that you're trying to do food photography, not too many people can do that very well. When I had my restaurant, we had several people I knew that were great with head shots and whatnot try to take some and we were never that never happy with the results. The best one we ever got I got myself once after trying for about an hour using every trick I could think of.

I'm 54 and my background is in sales, marketing, and the restaurant biz. Now granted, I've been active with bitcoin/litcoin for about a year now, but anyone my age without a detailed tech background can more then grasp it given a little bit of time to read up on it.

And you're welcome for your equally arrogant reply

 well at least you found part of what I said amusing. I thought the first part was. :) There has to be truth in order for something to be funny. I've been a long time libertarian, but I've grown very tired over the years of people who have become the these self proclaimed, I don't know, maybe gurus of it (again in their own mind) To me they do far more harm they they will ever do good, as people who disagree with them will always be turned off by their self proclaimed knowledge that they alone are right all the time... and I mean always. You have to always have humility to be a leader, and these guys are not that. That's why I call it the way I see it.

As to why he was banned?? Maybe it's that he just blew the limits set for pompous arrogance set by Google's algorithm. I know guys that are worth a bloody fortune, have succeed in business way way way beyond anything I have done, and they don't have 1/1000 the arrogance about their own business skills that this guy has about his own beliefs.

I remember, remember the 5th of November

That was an old clip that they just added to this story. I remember seeing that same clip with the guy and his Cooler Master case in a video maybe about a year ago.

Wow you know some fancy words. I'll make it simple. The world is made up of people and the way to be liked is not to endlessly talk down to people, like freaks like him do. Now I know many of his fans will say things like, "It doesn't matter, I don't like people" Well that's fine, you can live in your mom's basement and play video games by yourself and yell at your mom when she makes your sandwiches wrong. Hey knock yourself out, but don't expect anyone of us normal people (you know... all of us that you don't like) to give a rat's ass when a blowhard on the libertarian side of political spectrum is knocked off his platform any more than we care if a big government blowhard is. One last point, his views we probably fake anyhow, as I suspect no one played them back more often the he himself did. Guys like that who are enamored with the sound of their own voice, are probably the biggest viewers of their own stuff, as they love love love the sound of their own voice. I'd put him at the top of that list.
