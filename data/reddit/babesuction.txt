This list was posted [here]( this morning but seems to have been removed. 
The CEO of Breadwallet commented that [they will follow the 2x fork if it has hash-rate majority]( He was immediately attacked and apparently down-voted for providing this useful information, and Breadwallet is still listed on the above site. So I think expecting citations, or even basic honesty on this topic is asking too much. The FUD must flow.

How does it do this? 
The satellites are operated by commercial companies that can be influenced or shut-down by a hostile government. 
The blockchain service is being operated by Blockstream, a commercial company that can be influenced or shut-down by a hostile government.
A lot of people seem to think this is some sort of bullet proof way to ensure that access to the blockchain can't be interrupted. Realistically it will disappear if Blockstream forget to pay their bill.

We seem to be discussing different definitions of "consensus". That has happened a lot during the scaling debate. Almost like the definition keeps changing/being changed to avoid certain proposals. 
Who does my hypothetical BIP need to get "consensus" from? Does it need the agreement from people like Luke-jr, Greg Maxwell etc? Because if that's a requirement for any change to Bitcoin then it's fair to say that Bitcoin is heavily centralized and unhealthily under the control of employees of a private for-profit company. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 19:58:00
I believe the issue is that someone could theoretically have signed but not broadcast a transaction sending their coins from "old address" to "new address". They could then have destroyed the private keys to "old address" while saving the keys to "new address" and the un-broadcast transaction.
Now - theoretically - Bitcoin hard-forks with strong replay protection, the old chain dies out, and the funds on the new chain are locked/lost forever. 
I'm not sure if anyone actually stores their Bitcoins in metaphorical limbo like that. But you'd be pissed off if you did.

Or you could argue that with an average of e.g. 900KB "real" economic activity per block, an 8MB block is 71 times as difficult to fill with spam as a 1MB block. 
Miners can choose to ignore zero fee transactions even when blocks are empty and - despite the weird "latency + government" conspiracy theory - they have no real incentive to push for massive blocks. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 22:34:34
The vast majority of the miners have explicitly pledged to run the 2x chain. Saying "nah, I bet they just won't" is pure wishful thinking. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 19:49:10
Cheap spam or expensive transactions. You kind of have to pick one. 
Bitcoin Cash is opting to accept the potential for abusive spam and expensive nodes in return for the ability to transact cheaply. 
Bitcoin Core seem to favor making spam expensive and nodes cheap, and are willing to accept paying multi-dollar fees for every transaction. 
Those pushing for SegWit2x seem to want something inbetween.
I guess maybe individuals should think about and decide for themselves which of those three options they really personally agree with. Ideally without resorting to tribal warfare, mud-slinging, and silly hats. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 20:08:22


Very much correct. But I believe the majority of Merchants who accept Bitcoin actually use a third party service like Bitpay or Coinbase, and both of those companies signed up to the New York agreement. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 20:00:24


These operations *already* jumped in. That's what the NYA was. I'm asking someone to rationalise why they would jump out again? It will make them look very untrustworthy and they all seem to potentially gain from increasing the blocksize anyway. So they'd be hurting themselves in the short term... in order to hurt themselves in the long term?
@_date: 2017-08-23 19:42:20


This is logically inconsistent. You're saying the increased capacity of the forked chain doesn't help with low value transactions because it has no merchant adoption, therefore increasing capacity on the chain that *does* have adoption wouldn't help either... because reasons?

The world is full of copycat technologies and businesses that beat the first mover and became the market leader. Facebook wasn't the first social network, google wasn't the first search engine, Starbucks wasn't the first coffee-shop. 
People buy altcoins because they figure there is a chance one of those will end up being the dominant form of cryptocurrency.

@_date: 2017-08-23 20:53:16


This is basically the only sensible thing you've said on this topic. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 22:15:23
Your argument is very confusing/confused and verbose. But I think you're attempting to make the oft-repeated suggestion that blocks will always fill up because people will use the available space making pointless transactions and storing arbitrary data. That's a great theoretical argument that is only up against 8 years of empirical data (i.e. 1MB blocks didn't fill up until quite recently despite Bitcoin having significant usage and publicity).
Besides that you're also arguing that high fees prevented you from sending the test transactions that you would usually like to... but that's actually a good thing somehow... Yay for our increasingly expensive and less and less usable currency!
@_date: 2017-08-11 22:34:46
You can read the actual details of the NYA agreement [here]( Yes, it does seem like you're missing or confused about some things, possibly due to getting second hand information. 
The agreement includes a section where a subset of the signatories specifically pledged to "provide technical and engineering support to test and support the upgrade software, as well as to assist companies with preparing for the upgrades"
That part was signed by: 
* Abra  
* BitClub Network  
* Bitcoin.com  
* BitFury  
* BitGo  
* Bitmain  
* BitPay  
* Blockchain  
* Bloq  
* BTCC  
* Circle  
* Ledger  
* RSK Labs  
* Xapo
So the people signing the NYA clearly knew that Core wouldn't support it. Hence why Jeff Garzik went to work pretty much immediately on btc1. 
And that's exactly how things are supposed to work, isn't it? The Core developer group isn't an authority. They write and release code, the community decides whether to run it or not. Other teams are free to write and release alternative implementations, and the community is still free to run it or not... aren't they? 
@_date: 2017-08-11 23:31:20


Many BIPs have been made regarding increasing the "maxblocksize". Given that it requires a hard-fork, the discussion of those BIPs tends quickly towards "You can't do this without overwhelming consensus". 
The NYA was an attempt to cut through the circular arguments and show that a large proportion of the Bitcoin ecosystem *absolutely is* willing to take part in a blocksize increasing hard-fork. It's precisely the kind of "economic consensus" that some developers had been using as a shield against all hard-fork proposals for a long time. And it was very enlightening to see which Core developers jumped straight on twitter and reddit to trash the agreement within hours of it's announcement.  


I have no idea. Their comments make no sense. But then there seem to be enough idiots making silly arguments on both sides of this never ending argument. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 22:46:05


You're citing the most easily game-able Bitcoin metric and a completely dishonest website. 
Most of those "nob2x" companies have simply not stated their position yet. The link provided for Breadwallet explicitly says that they *shouldn't* be on the list, and their CEO has explicitly stated they will support the majority hash-rate chain. Yet the nob2x owner decided to move them under the confusing title of "Does not run full nodes" instead of just admitting that they aren't at all opposed to 2x.
Resorting to such poor quality "evidence" like this makes me think you don't even believe what you're saying. Is it possible that you're getting tired of this never ending battle? 
@_date: 2017-08-09 07:37:34


I already explained the reason for these companies not to voice their support. You are going to attack any of them that do. 


It's not misguided. It's a different interpretation to the one you have. But I think the definition of Bitcoin given by u/aaronvoisine would have been pretty acceptable to most people for most of the history of Bitcoin. 


If you don't make any efforts yourself, that's fine. That's totally your choice. But right now you are actively trying to sabotage the efforts of others and encourage self-censorship from companies that don't want to be subjected to social media attacks.

Who do you imagine the lawsuit would be directed against? 
@_date: 2017-08-23 21:20:14
He can secure the two pieces of information separately. i.e. keys on his computer, transaction on some memory stick(s) in some secure location(s).
If someone gets hold of his computer alone, all they find is an empty bitcoin wallet with no history of any funds and no way to connect him to his holdings, let alone seize them. 
If someone gets hold of a copy of the transaction alone... the worst thing they can do is broadcast it at which point his funds will show up in his wallet. 
So yes, it does provide more security, and anonymity. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 18:27:36
My ISP connects me to a decentralized network of nodes. Barring elaborate attacks it's very difficult for those nodes to send me bad data, and the nodes that do misbehave are quickly blocked by their peers. 
Your satellite service broadcasts the blocks that Blockstream decides to broadcast. It is a far more centralized and vulnerable "source of truth" than the internet.
You're calling it a redundancy, but if you didn't believe that at least some people would come to rely on this service you wouldn't have bothered setting it up. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 21:14:38


I'm a bit confused. Are you saying the 2MB HF was supposed to provide breathing space while SegWit adoption rolled out, even though the HF was originally supposed to happen 6 months after SegWit activation? 
I think it was fairly clear that at least the mining community weren't prepared to accept SegWit on its own. Otherwise the NYA never would have been necessary. So for them it's not an issue of whether SegWit will increase capacity quickly enough, it's whether any additional on-chain scaling will happen. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 21:05:54


That's a sentiment usually directed at clueless noobs who leave large sums of bitcoin on exchanges or custodial wallets. This scenario would more likely be an advanced Bitcoin user taking advantage of the expected behavior of the protocol to provide extra security and anonymity to their funds. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 22:48:41
You shouldn't concern yourself with all these forks. Just make sure your node connects directly to Blockstream HQ and everything will be fine. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 19:57:20


You are making an argument against the idea of doing a hard-fork. But that's irrelevant. The NYA participants already agreed to do a hard-fork. The miners already ran a client that is counting down to a November hard-fork (unless we really believe all the miners faked their signalling). So it's now an opt-out rather than opt-in situation. 
Opting out, breaking the agreement, pissing off at least some portion of the userbase and other bitcoin businesses - that's a big move to make. So i'm asking others: what reason do any of the NYA signatories have for wanting to sabotage the 2x hard-fork?
@_date: 2017-08-16 20:26:53
I said "barring elaborate attacks". 
Call me crazy but I think the danger of a sybil attack from my ISP is less than the risk of people getting their blockchain updates from a company with clearly very strong opinions about how Bitcoin should operate. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 20:58:53
But they can only be used to buy bitcoin because they have value to begin with. That value comes from speculation and/or pumping as everyone else has said. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 07:02:38
So: 
* Someone makes a list subtly but clearly designed to make it look like Bitcoin businesses are against the SegWit2x hard-fork.
* A representative from one of the listed companies comes on to explain that they *will* follow the fork if it has majority hash power. 
* You immediately start attacking them and warning people not to use their services. 
Do you think maybe there's a reason why 70+ Bitcoin companies, exchanges, and wallets haven't publicly stated their position on SegWit2x?
Do you think maybe quite a few of these businesses are actually fine with the concept of a modest blocksize increasing fork in November, but they don't want several months of social media attacks against them from people like you? 
Do you think that actions like this lead to sensible discussion and consensus building? 
@_date: 2017-08-23 19:37:22

* Companies that didn't sign the NYA and have stated they won't support the SegWit2x fork
* Companies that haven't made a statement either way
But you don't see any value in listing: 
* Companies that signed the NYA and haven't withdrawn
* Companies that didn't sign the NYA but have expressed their support for the SegWit2x fork
You don't think those lists are useful information to have?

So Apple have optimized their way to 16 times as much RAM and about 5 times as much storage for their OS. Plus realistically no-one actually expects to run Sierra on a 2GB RAM machine (because no-one who is serious about their tech *has* a 2GB machine anymore). 


I'm not advocating for a rushed non-optimized route. I'm advocating for a sensible balance that makes efforts towards optimization while still making use of expanding hardware availability. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 19:59:33
Yeah, I'm struggling to see any irony. 
I *have* seen variations on the questions you asked many times before. Not sure I ever recall seeing a sensible answer. 
I guess we just have to accept that: "Core don't control Bitcoin. They just write code and make it available". But also accept that any hardfork would clearly be a hostile takeover and would leave Bitcoin's future in the unilateral control of whomever controls that Github repo.

Either the tweeter is a big-blocker making a deliberately bad argument that he knew small-blockers would retweet/upvote. Or he's a small-blocker making a genuine but bad argument. 
Investing huge amounts of time and effort into code-optimizations when you have plenty of hardware capacity to expand into is horribly inefficient. 
However, if you get a group of software developers together who all share the same sort of mindset they will happily spend months making some process 20% faster while the "company" around them crashes and burns. 
Bitcoin development used to have a healthy mix of "we need to optimize this" devs and "we can just throw more hardware at it" devs. But instead of compromising between the two positions we now only have the optimization guys left.

Coin.dance not only lists opposition and support for proposals, but they actually agree to count entities like [bitcoinknots]( - which is just Luke-Jr's custom Bitcoin client, and [bitcoinreminder]( - an sms price notification service. 
The owners of both those "companies" are clearly heavily biases against any non-Core proposal, and neither of them carries any real economic weight. So the fact that coin.dance still lists their views is pretty good evidence against any anti-core bias.
So we have one site that actually shows both sides of the debate, and then a couple of sites that shamelessly misrepresent companies stances and ignore any company that goes against their agenda. Guess which of those are being constantly linked to on this sub? 
@_date: 2017-10-14 20:05:33

Am I the only one around here who thinks that information is useful and misinformation is destructive? 
OP has posted a screenshot of a private email, which makes a general statement about "a hard fork without strong replay protection". OP has not included the email that they sent to this company provoking this response, and the response makes no explicit reference to SegWit2x or the NYA.
Crypto Facilities pledged their support for the NYA as part of a public declaration. Yet for some reason they've chosen to withdraw that support privately in an email to some random redditor. Does that actually seem legit to any of you? 
The current top comment on this thread is a link to the clearly dishonest  site, which lists numerous major Bitcoin companies who have made absolutely no statement about their support (or lack thereof) for the SegWit2x fork. The same link was also posted by u/S_Lowry with the misleading text: 


But no problem, at least 3 people have corrected the record by linking to  which has handily been updated to reflect Crypto Facilities withdrawal (via a screenshotted email to OP). This site lists 7 of the NYA signatories as having "moved on to Bitcoin Cash". Because clearly that's an accurate reflection of their position on the SegWit2x fork, and not a completely misleading thing to say. 
So seriously: Do you people come here for information about Bitcoin? Or for some sort of the_donald style shameless circle-jerk where people compete to see who can lie the loudest? 
@_date: 2017-10-09 20:17:04


Really? You're not sure how a private email to you (that doesn't actually mention SegWit2x or the NYA) isn't the same as a public statement retracting their previously stated support? 
@_date: 2017-10-09 20:09:44
Philosophically that may be correct but practically it's not. 
If the government had started using public tax-payer funds to buy-up Bitcoins it would have raised questions and in the world of highly partisan politics people would have been all over the story like a rash. 
If the government had sat on their seized assets for years it would have gone without comment.

Isn't that a list of businesses that have announced that they don't support 2x, plus a bunch of other much larger and more important businesses that haven't actually made a statement either way? 
I'm pretty sure the maintainer of that list has been called out repeatedly for pushing misleading information. And the fact that most of the significant companies listed don't have links to their alleged statements is very telling. 
Hey u/rnvk, have bitfinex, bitstamp, cex, coinfloor, coinjar, gemini, kraken, poloniex, etc etc etc *actually* made a statement regarding SegWit2x? 
And can you explain why breadwallet were moved to "Does not run full nodes" after the CEO explicitly stated that they *do* support the 2x fork?
@_date: 2017-10-05 06:02:47
Yes, exactly. Coin.dance has always appeared to be a legitimate attempt to track the support for or against particular proposals - i.e. genuinely useful information. 
My point was that you seemed to be suggesting ways that u/rnvk could improve their site (and separating out the companies that haven't actually made any statement would be a very good improvement), but you stopped short of the suggesting that they actually add any sort of balance.
Obviously the long-term debate has led to community divides and lots of very strong opinions. But I wonder sometimes whether people recognise where they personally have got to in their thinking. Do you actually *consciously* think a one-sided propaganda site is a good thing to link people to? 
@_date: 2017-10-05 06:22:43


Really? You think the guys working on a decentralised commerce platform allowed themselves to be bought wholesale for about the cost of one dev's annual salary?


I'm wondering how long this list would have to become before you questioned whether they might have a valid point? 
 


 


It seems like a valid point. The Hong Kong meeting was basically just a deal struck between mining pool operators and a contingent of mostly Blockstream employees, and the deal was explicitly designed to stop the miners from switching over to Bitcoin Classic. i.e. they didn't want to risk letting users decide the outcome. 
Yet lately u/adam3us is all over the place talking about how "bizcoin" is a backroom deal between business suits and miners to cut users out of the equation. 
The two agreements may not be identical, but it's hard to deny the parallels.

Have Jaxx or Crypto facilities made any actual statements about their position on the fork? I mean other than personal emails to you. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 23:12:15
I'm not "bitching about it". I'm pointing out that these community made websites are horribly and deliberately misleading. I'm pointing out that other users of this sub are being *even more* misleading in the way they cite these community made websites. 
And I'm pointing out that almost everyone here (including the maintainers of those websites) jumped all over your post despite the fact what you've shown us is pretty sketchy (not saying you *have* faked it, but think how easily you could do so), and it certainly doesn't constitute a public statement from this company. 
As I said at the start: Information is useful. Misinformation is destructive. A statement from Bitstamp, Bitfinex or any other major exchange would be really useful information. Sites that deliberately misrepresent the views of those companies are basically cancer. Apparently this sub really loves cancer right now.
@_date: 2017-10-03 22:26:50
You seem to be massively missing my point. 
Two websites have updated their listings on the basis of your screenshot from an out-of-context email. I'm pretty certain that neither of the maintainers of those sites sought independent verification of Crypto facilities position. And - correct me if i'm wrong - Crypto facilities have not made a public statement on this topic, have they? 
So if I post a screenshot of an email from Bitstamp saying they are going to support SegWit2x, do you think these sites will be rushing to add them to the supporter lists? No, of course not. Because this isn't information, it's pure unadulterated propaganda. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 22:00:13


It's different, but it's not entirely different. Bitcoin is now in direct competition with many hundreds of clone coins all seeking to overthrow its first mover advantage and become *the* cryptocurrency. So it's important to take a wider view when deciding how to scale (or any other strategic decisions). 


Sure, but that's a delicate equilibrium, not an absolutist statement. If Bitcoin isn't as cheap and quick to transact with then users will move to other cryptocurrecies, and the most censorship resistant currency in the world is still useless if no-one wants to transact with it. 
It's a balancing act, and it's rather improbable that the right balance happens to be the 1MB limit that people have been fighting over for the last... god knows how many years.

Where does your understanding of this come from? 
Right now [87% of miners]( are signalling their intention to run SegWit2x. So I guess either:
1. Jihan Wu has near complete monopoly of all mining (in which case it's weird he hasn't used this power to force a change to Bitcoin already) 
2. Lots of miners are fake signalling just to get the SegWit part (in which case why didn't they just signal SegWit for the last 9 months)
3. Possibly this route forward has broad support and is actually a good compromise that we should all be pulling together on?... No? Ok, lets keep everyone fighting each other for a couple more years. Good plan.

Of the five previous Core seeders three work at Blockstream, and Matt Corallo used to work at Blockstream and is still listed on their website. I'm not sure where Jonas Schnelli lives, but I think targeting the that very short list of people (most of whom eat lunch together) would be a lot easier than targetting the 4 companies btc1 proposed to use as seeds. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 00:01:24
This is no more true than saying Luke-jr (one of the existing Core seeds) has been positioned to collect data on ALL nodes that are running. 
Wait, is that how Luke has been producing his massive node counts? Because that would mean that Luke was *actually* exploiting this default seed position to collect data on nodes in exactly the way that this post is hypothesizing Jeff's company *might* use it. That'd be an interesting twist, right? 
@_date: 2017-07-15 23:39:43
I refer you to point 2 from my post above. If a significant chunk of the miners want to activate SegWit only, why didn't they? They've had 9 months to do so.

Can you clarify whether you're calling me a fool because you just think it's obvious that's how he collected his stats, or if Luke has ever declared that he was doing this? 
Because last I heard Luke was refusing to describe his methodology so that people wouldn't be able to game the counts. 
Could you also clarify what you expect Jeff Garzik's company to do with a default seed position? And why you trust Luke and the other handful of Core devs *not* to use the position in that way? 
@_date: 2017-07-04 14:51:01


There are conventions around the [numbering on software releases]( Basically the second and third number denote minor changes and bug-fixes respectively. The first number denotes major changes, which are not backwards compatible. 
So for any given hard-fork the first number absolutely should be incremented. If Core ever release their own hard-fork, or if they merge in the SegWit2x hard-fork code, they will increase that versioning number too.

The poll results themselves show that the vast majority of subjects read rbitcoin, and a much smaller proportion read other forums.

You're basically saying you don't trust companies like BitPay and Blockchain.info, but you were totally fine with this power resting with 5 guys - several of whom work for the same company.

Given the previous list of seed owners it would seem a prudent step to ensure that they can't conspire to prevent SegWit2x nodes finding each other. Bitcoin is all about trustlessness and anti-fragility isn't it? So trusting the Core developer seeders to do the right thing in this instance would be anti-bitcoin.

Sorry, my bad. I searched for it on rbtc and it was indeed posted a few hours ago. 
I'm a bit confused though. When I click "other discussions" on the rbtc version I see this post and one from BitcoinAll. But when I click "other discussions" on this post the rbtc post is not visible. Is there some lag period or something?

Right now he'd just be linking to a poll that ~180 r/bitcoin users have filled in. It's not exactly an unbiased estimate of community support.

When people want to worry you about decentralization, there are about 6,000 nodes. 
When Luke-jr wants to tell everyone how overwhelmingly the community supports Bitcoin Core, there are at least 50,000 and 99% of them run Core. 
It all depends on what methodology you use to get your counts, and on what message you are trying to send.

You mean; everyone told you how ridiculous your idea was, how antithetical it was to Bitcoin's core principles, and how no-one would follow it. Plus I just pointed out how utterly hypocritical you are being. So now you're going to pretend it was "just a prank, bro".

If we actually increased Bitcoin's blocksize parameters to the point where you would need a $20,000 computer to run a full node... you still wouldn't need a $20,000 computer to run a full node. 
It would take many years, probably a decade or two before the network actually reached capacity again, and by that point the price of that $20,000 computer would have dropped massively. 
In the meantime people with mid-range desktop computers and a half-decent internet connection would be more than capable of keeping pace with the expanding usage. Plus they would benefit from the massive increase in value for their bitcoin holdings. 
So the $20,000 quote is actually completely stupid (not surprising from Craig Wrong) and completely irrelevant to any discussion of actual Bitcoin scaling.

No, it wouldn't be any harder to implement confidential transactions or any other feature after SegWit2x activates. Core would need to adopt the 2mb hard-fork and then they would be fully compatible again. 


Exactly. You seem to fully understand the concept of decentralized development, far more so than certain public figures who have been talking about corporate takeovers.

Ignoring the possibility that Bitcoin could lose out to another cryptocurrency seems a bit naive and arrogant don't you think?
