What dilemma?
@_date: 2014-01-16 14:06:33
No. I just withdrew 2250 € on dec 2, 1000 € was in my bank account dec 27 and another 1000 € today (jan 16). I expect the last 250 € in 20 days as per their specification.
Edit: Danish bank account.
@_date: 2014-01-16 14:55:44
The last time I did it, it took about 30 mins. But I hear that currently people have to wait a whole day, depending on amount.
Edit: spelling
@_date: 2014-06-18 09:10:23
No it's a one-way function, not a trapdoor function. Because there exists no secret information that will give you the original input from the hash.

I think it's because they had $5 million ceased (and many more invested in hardware) and now they have to earn the money in trading fees before they can pay them out.

So you agree..

"almost impossible to counterfeit" - immediate sign of lack of insight.

This is so yesterday

Yes, then what? If people like them they'll use them, if not they don't.
@_date: 2013-04-27 22:49:36
How come everybody thinks this is impossible? Everybody with sufficient funds are able to peg the bitcoin to a specific value. Just by buying and selling bitcoins, possibly with a loss.
@_date: 2013-11-17 20:36:58
No. The last satoshi client allowed free transactions over 0.01 BTC. Which of course is to prevent spam transactions, the new clients are taking this way to far.
@_date: 2013-04-27 13:54:47
So by that logic no shops would ever take credit cards because credit card transactions can be cancelled weeks after the purchase.
@_date: 2013-04-22 09:47:15
You speak from experience, I can tell..
@_date: 2013-10-12 17:14:58
And, wow, one megabitcoin is, like, 142 million dollars..
@_date: 2013-11-24 11:12:09
Bitcoin is mentioned first time around 12:00, and the bitcoin related interview starts around 13:00..
@_date: 2013-06-20 13:11:06
Exactly. I believe JP Morgan was concerned with the trust issue, and therefore would have be likely to accept bitcoins as money.

There are many successful business models that rely on tipping. But I don't think we need to worry about this until we start seeing the big mining players go down one after another. 
@_date: 2013-04-18 12:05:02
What? If 1% of the world population held an equal share of the 21 million bitcoins, they would each have nearly 300 million satoshis. When all bitcoins have been mined there will be 2.100.000.000.000.000 satoshis.
@_date: 2013-11-18 09:31:18
Was this on the way up? Or down? Or up the 2nd time.. or down the 2nd time? Or 3rd or 4th?
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:07:31
So what you are saying is that all us enthusiasts will let bitcoin die, because we selfishly will pay less and less in fees.. because we can..
I don't see that happening.

I don't think he knows how arguments work. I'm relieved to see he is an arts major.

Better get in now. I think 88 was the low in this round.
@_date: 2013-07-31 09:55:30
No.. that's Danish Peoples Party
@_date: 2013-07-31 11:24:54
Yeah. Wasn't it your country that sort of invented that type of party or was it Austria?
@_date: 2013-04-27 23:08:31
Actually it is very much possible to peg the bitcoin to a certain value. If I always buy bitcoins sold at a price below 100 dollars and always willing to sell at $100, possibly by buying at a (temporary) overprice and immediately reselling at $100, then I have effectively peg the bitcoin to the value of $100.
.. Retard.  
@_date: 2013-11-17 22:40:39
Interesting problem. It already seems clear that we cannot avoid major player miners. But you making a client that has a 'fair' fee, does not prevent others from making a client that uses 'unfair' fees. So flooding will always be a miner problem, not a client problem. And miners can set their own prices to what they want and use traditional dos attack prevention methods.
@_date: 2013-04-17 16:12:02
Why do you assume the vendor will convert the bitcoins to fiat money before converting them to goods?
@_date: 2013-04-19 08:08:17
Nice, I never realized I had a 'liked' tab. Excellent!
@_date: 2013-07-22 12:44:17
Which of course is ludicrous. There already exists more satoshis than dollar cents in the world.
@_date: 2013-11-06 14:28:15
TIL the bitcoin protocol is not bully-proof, the mining community is though.
@_date: 2013-11-17 21:41:23
Hmm.. I better moderate my language. My hope is that the bitcoin can be safe from spam attacks and the like, while it keeps to be as versatile as possible. Thank you for the great work you are doing for the community.
@_date: 2013-11-17 19:12:36
Yes, the fee should be based on the ideas of the free market. Not dictated by a small group of client developers, I think that goes against the whole idea of bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-09-01 15:15:32
The 4. point in the original post is definitely not valid. There is no scarcity. True, there is only ever going to be 21 million whole bitcoins, but there are 21 billion milli-bitcoins, 21 trillion micro-bitcoins, 21 quadrillion nano-bitcoins.. and so forth. The current protocol only allows for a bitcoin to be divided into 100 million elements called satoshis, but this means that there are as many satoshis as there are US dollars in the world.
@_date: 2013-09-15 19:45:27
I bet you are wearing a tin foil hat right now.
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:19:39
The scenario you are describing is a very common market scenario with a surplus of supply. This will result in miners going out of business until the fees and block rewards are enough to sustain the remaining miners. This will not hurt the blockchain integrity due to the lower hash rate that would result in a lower difficulty.
@_date: 2013-04-22 13:24:37
So who handles the money transfers?
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:55:48
Didn't see your edit there..
That argument can be uses any where.. Why does McDonald throw away stale hamburgers? According to your argument they should be interested in any nonzero payment.
Miners, being intelligent agents, will not undermine their own business. (no pun intended)
Interestingly this is exactly what further studies of the prisoner's dilemma showed. That humans tend to cooperate to avoid mutually destructive behavoir.

Bitcoin bubble!
@_date: 2013-11-18 15:22:47
You are mixing a lot of things together here.
When you say 'this' is pure game theory, I'm going to assume that you mean the mechanism controlling the average transaction fee. Ok. I can accept that. Then you bring up the prisoner's dilemma. I'm going to assume that this is because you argue that there are similarities between the prisoner's dilemma and setting the transaction fee. You have to explain that further. I don't see any similarities beyond what is normal in a competitive market, eg. selling your commodity at a lower price point will hurt both you and your competitor.
I don't believe the free market can solve anything? I don't know how you got that idea?
I have been reading up on the problem we're facing. I don't see how that will broaden my *political* knowledge.
@_date: 2013-11-17 20:13:07
Way ahead of me? I want the transaction fee to be determined by free market forces, just like the bitcoin protocol intended. The qt developers with Gavin in the lead are the ones at risk of ruining the network, by second guessing the original design, with their "smarter" fees.
@_date: 2013-07-29 11:49:01
The block rate is supposed to be six per hour on average. The [difficulty]( is set every two weeks to keep it so.
*edit: link to better explanation
@_date: 2013-11-18 08:26:10
That's not how the free market works.
@_date: 2013-04-23 21:06:11
But what's the point?
@_date: 2013-07-31 09:34:40
You must be american, where liberal means left-wing. The Liberal Alliance consists of what you would call libertarians and is a right-wing party in Denmark.
