Its a hard time to make a decision on that. I would wait until the fork will happened and then make a decision on wether buy or not

I just assume most Chinese traders to sleep like a log after long trading night. Lol

Where did you get this feeling from? I don't say that disagree I just have no idea what is going on with bitcoin
@_date: 2017-03-11 03:56:38
lost in time guys

I used to use Coinbase until they suspended my account without any additional information. I submitted all type of verifications to them but they don't care. I think coinbase is very unreliable so far. 
Moreover they have such an awful costumer service, there is no phone number to get in touch with them only email - millions of dollars invested and only email support...

But Democrats were lying to you...
@_date: 2017-03-11 19:05:27
They really have no clue about what bitcoin is.
@_date: 2017-03-13 23:32:27
I also had a problems with coinbase very silly website. You have to try to log in and see the page to transfer money or you can wait because processing usually take up to one week per transfer

Thanks, but unfortunately I created my account only few days ago and it allows to leave comments there only if you have been using reditt for 10 days 
@_date: 2017-03-20 12:54:52
sorry I meant fork, the split between bitcoin developers 
@_date: 2017-03-17 21:06:46
I probably gonna sell it all now. Lol
@_date: 2017-11-23 23:30:27
It might become a very expensive purchase one day ����

What happened? Why you are no longer interested in iot?
@_date: 2017-05-15 14:41:22
nithing happening 
@_date: 2017-05-20 17:53:32
Same problem, my transaction has been unconfirmed for more then 2 days. 
I think developers should think about that, because we not gonna hold 2K high.

Trying to gain some stabilization to not let it be taken my bear market? 
Its really interesting to see how this works 
@_date: 2017-05-11 18:38:00
litecoin is pretty parabolic 
@_date: 2017-05-12 03:15:57
the story short - story pump.
bitcoin has no future when all the masses will start using it because of it slow transactions that's gonna be way longer than waiting for a doctor at public hospital.
I do believe that core understand that as well but unfortunately they did not take an action and now they are losing with their failing technology 
@_date: 2017-05-20 01:45:19
OMG. Thank you. Really comprehensive answer!

I have been using coinbase until I got my account frozen without any additional comments and technical support. Afterwards I have started using Gemini and so far they look pretty reliable I would recommend Gemini over Coinbase
