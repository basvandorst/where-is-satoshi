Ok listen, you public address is the one that you give to people for them to send you bitcoin, your private address you should keep it private as the name says with your private key you can access your funds and send them or do whatever you want with the bitcoin on there.
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:55:15
Most probably you have the bitcoin on one of thos 2 addresses since it takes some time to broadcast the transaction
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:05:42
Hi, nope it's not a dumb question :) I got confused too, satoshi means that bitcoin has eight decimals after the dot meaning 0.00000001 = 1 SATOSHI there 435 staotshis is 0.0000043-0.0000044, so its like .07 cents actually, but the thing is 435 satoshis per byte so every transaction has around 374 bytes therefore its 435 x 374= 162690 sats so its like 26$ the fee.

Most probably by January 2018 there will be a much better miner so its probably worth it to wait to buy miners. check profits on whattomine.
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:03:28


I can try to accelerate your transaction but it will cost you around 20$
Will let you know when I have accelerated it.
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:34:50
hahaha thanks, but I dont have any bcash that's why i need .0065
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:47:28
Usually when BTC starts going up people get into BTC not to miss the rally so that causes altcoins to go down.
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:44:28
I think jaax said the extension has nothing to do with them, use it at your own risk
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:01:27
Jaax is not open source, but its okay.

if its still in adoption then yes, after it becomes normal then no
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:24:16
Hi please erase that now.
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:28:57
xPub is short for Extended Public Key. Your wallet itself has a master xPub or extended public key, and each category you create is an extension of that public key. This means that each public bitcoin address you generate in your wallet also stems from your xPubs and your wallet's master xPub.
If you don't have a decent understanding of what your xPub is, we advise against showing the xPub. It's important to only share your xPub with those you trust. If someone obtains your xPub, they may be able to monitor your transaction history and disrupt your access to your wallet. A warning is displayed when you click Show xPub to reiterate this.  
Therefore I advise you to edit your message and erase the xpub
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:10:21
Transaction has been accelerated!
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:12:45
Do not use your private key anywhere, please be carefull.
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:15:29
Hi, I want to help you but im not quite sure since i never mined so early, I think your best bet is a google search 
search everything possible, you might have tons of bitcoin is worth it if you cab find it.
Also dont trust anyone if they ask you to send something over or try team viewer.
I search for information available, if I find something Ill let you know.
check this. 
Also read this:
I hope you are able to recover all that BTC! let me know what happens at the end :)
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:59:30
if you do have your private key which should look like this L1e669RsUHAXGPB3RKnEj62rWfFDARZVX4C1WZC7BTYvLdmtYqjy
Then download Electrum and on the top click add new bitcoin private key and it should import all into your electrum wallet official link for electrum wallet is this 
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:48:06
Hi, would you let me know all the 3 public addresses which you sent bitcoin and have your bitcoin?
you can pm them if you wish to be private.
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:15:46
Hi, here you can check the current fee 
take in mind that satoshi price you need to multiply with the transaction bytes size.
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:45:06
Probably there is a way to bruteforce the password with a bruteforcer youll have to find the software.
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:22:48
I dont think exchanges let you proceed with a blank box, it should still be in the account if you dont get it in a few hours, send them a ticket with your issue.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:20:34
I understand, but you should know when someone ask you to screen shot your wallet then there you can make a mistake and screenshot the private keys, but on exchanges online the only way to access funds is by login in to your account, with your username and password and most probably you have enable 2fa so you need also the 2fa code to log in, therefore its impossible to steal funds by  a screenshot of the exchange page, unless you screen shot your username and password and send the 2fa code available at time.
I understand your concern hope this clears your doubts.
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:11:43
It has confirmed now.
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:44:39
Can you provide me with a screenshot to a PM thanks.
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:39:58
Correct. but if you also can save on a paper the private key is good.
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:49:34
If you think im trying to hack him you are so wrong first of all you dont have a private key when your money is in coinbase, therefore the 5 addresse are probably for different coins.
Please calm down...
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:08:49
The mem pool is super full, unfortunately at this time since alot of people are moving btc around it is more expensive check this site for current rates  
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:47:09
What is the address?
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:46:54

@_date: 2017-12-10 00:46:10
I thought I read 2011 lol
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:41:20
the reason most wallets wont give you the private key is since then you can get hacked so they have the option of the mnemonic that one. you enter it it sweeps your funds to the new wallet. Its all about security dont worry :)
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:20:31
Hey thanks, I appreciate you sending me the ltc, and I am really happy you got the money back. good luck with your bitcoin and stay safe.
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:06:26
Also unless you are able to raise the fees dont send the transaction since the fees are way to low they wont confirm for days, they can even return back since fees are too low.
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:47:31
I will help you recover your btc
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:48:15
Ok,but do you have username: and pass: or do you have a private key?
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:45:10
your welcome ::))
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:46:13
Can you explain?
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:36:39
did you have the bitcoins on blockchain wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:08:18
Sorry I was not able to accelerate the transaction.
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:31:46
go to snipta.com
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:30:53
check this thread also 
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:44:39
Yes you can add more on the fees I think on electrum and Im pretty sure viabtc is still working send me your transaction id let me check.
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:17:39
true thought about that.
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:31:16
bro you are so ignorant...
I just created a account to see what was there, all public keys, man you should really learn a bit more about bitcoin before accusing me of a scammer.
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:19:51
Yes every exchange has a a withdrawal fee usually is there next to the withdrawal text box
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:35:49
If its your wallet and not an exchange then you should be able to see your private key, but usually they give you a mnemonic phrase to backup your wallet check in settings, the public key is usually where there is a button that says receive transactions.
check a tutorial in youtube. bitcoin wallet bitcoin private key etc
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:36:34
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:43:10
yes, next time before you do a transaction please check this site  currently at 435 satoshis transaction times can take from 0-45 minutes.
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:46:09


I thought your transaction was of 350$.
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:38:36
there is no such a thing as bitcoin wallet app it must have a name such as brands,  in example:electrum, jaax, exodus. the username and paas you mentioned are choosen by you or they are randomly generated text meaning you have your private key to the wallet if you do then I could help you recover your wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:01:33
depends what month on 2011?
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:01:29
please show me the transaction id?
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:41:33
ask me for my bcash address please
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:17:11
Ok nothing is showing up that is recently on that address, most probaBly since BTC mempool is clogged the transaction will arrive but with a delay, sorry.
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:32:25
If you can send me the transaction ID i might be able to accelerate it.
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:55:17
They probably mix it to make it untraceable before even withdrawing to fiat, if you withdraw directly from stolen address, one possible way is depositing on a exchange that will make the exchange freeze the account since they already have the report of the address of the stolen funds, it has happened before, someone stole I don't remember how much and they deposited right away on coinbase if im not mistaken and the btc was freeze and was later refunded to the real owners.
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:47:36
check on hackforums.net ask around over there.
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:57:25
Whats the address you thought you sended it to, and on coinspot don't you see transaction id?
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:06:55
At different time during that year prices changed
1$ BTC : 157$ = 157 BTC = 2,517,355.27$
2$ BTC : 157$  = 78.5 BTC = 1,257,532.32$

@_date: 2017-12-08 07:06:14

@_date: 2017-12-10 22:09:32
your transaction is too small and also is using a too small fee I cant help you sorry.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:58:47
no once you send it there is no way back.
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:48:02
I am not a developer, searched for the id nothing found and there is no previous history on the address so I cant help you sorry.
if you have more info maybe take a screenshot idk i will see if i can help but have not found anything on the blockchain related, maybe blockcypher and blockchain are not broadcasting it dunno.
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:01:53

Hi, what was the name of the wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:31:55
I was trying to help you, its okay.
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:25:18
NVM i thought you posted your private key.
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:49:53
most of the people buying are from the us and since they are using gdax therefore price spikes on that exchange till most of the other exchanges catch up or arbitrage bots sell on gdax and prices fall to get t o the same level as other exchanges.
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:01:40


no funds where transfered to 1NCHPKy*********f3fMisYEX
What appears to me is that the transaction didint go thru either your internet went off or something, the bitcoin is almost 100% on your starting wallet 1DaCAHE***********vA3Uh5HiwgP
I recommend you opening the multibit wallet and check that your internet is online and the recheck balance if at most transaction does go thru it will appear at 1NCHPKye***********f3fMisYEX which is your ledger and you have your seed, if you dont manage to see your balance on the multibit and you have your private key then download electrum and add your key and you should have them funds there, if you dont see the funds on 1DaCAHEd***********A3Uh5HiwgP which they should be there then it is most likely being sent to  1NCHPKye**********kf3fMisYEX in your ledger.
not much to worry about since you double checked addresses and in the blockchain is still on your starting wallet.
The good thing about blockchain technology is that there is no errors on the blockchain. :)
I added the **** so you can edit your post and delete addresses for your privacy.
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:48:08
1.) Download electrum
2.) import your 12 word seed, open your wallet.
3.) find the transaction on Electrum
4.) Right click, then go to "Child Pays For Parent"
5.) It will ask you to put a new fee
6.) Manually put in a higher fee to get it confirmed  to estimate what is a good fee At the moment because fees go up and down )
