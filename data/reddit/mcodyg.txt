Generally you’ll see price consolidation along the support level. Or you will see a low that always seems to be hit and rallied off of.

I think the fear is the futures will influence the price of bitcoin much like the futures influence the price of the major indices (Dow, Nasdaq, S&amp;P). 
Futures contracts are agreements to buy or sell, in this case bitcoin, at a later date at a specified price. 
Futures contracts are therefore the perceived value of the underlying, which is why they tend to dictate the price of the underlying in the short term because the futures are supposed to forecast the price in the long term.
As far as taking any position (long / short) there will always be a person directly opposite your position. It’s the volume of orders, whether, sell side orders (shorts) or buy side orders (longs) that move the price on any exchange, from the NYSE to Bittrex.

You can purchase the Put but can’t you sell the contract before it’s deliverable if you don’t want to sell the bitcoin at the strike price??

Honestly just throw 100K or 250K in BTC and let her ride

People (traders) need volatility in order to make money. The price needs to move, either up or down, it doesn't matter as long as it moves someone is in the green. When the prices stabilize you *can* make money but its much less than what you could make with big swings in either direction

Tumblr and/or XMR

Plus anyone with any idea on how to keep themselves hidden will use BTC tumblers and such when purchasing from those places. Makes it impossible to trace via block chain gang bang

Bro it's not your fault they messed up. You might be able to take the money and run with it.. maybe wash it back into cryptos so its harder to find

About $300, if I offered you $300 would you take it?

I feel like this is foreshadowing whats about to come in the world of cryptos haha

It’s much worse than that.. [here](

Traditional futures contracts generally expire on the 3rd Friday of every month.. but there are also weeklys which expire on any given Friday.. at least that's how options contracts work

Yessss! Love the thought process! haha

Best advice, don't sell unless you need the money, that's the advice I use in traditional investing (don't trade cryptos I mine them) and I have done well.
