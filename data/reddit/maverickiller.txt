I have the same mentality as you. I only invest money that I would have blown on something else. When I've got something like 5-10 bitcoins I'll just let it ride. But then again I'm a complete noob.

Nothing it's more or less a way of saying buy it and leave it alone. Checking the balance of any investment constantly isn't wise, it's better to set up price alerts and let it ride. Especially with something as volatile as bitcoins. That's just my opinion though.

Not bad, reminds me a bit of this old PC game web war(I think that's what it was called). When's the release date?

I think it is referring to the overflow incident mentioned in the wiki above.

How did you add the money, if you used anything but a debit card I think you have to wait till the transaction posts.

Definitely, never put all your eggs into one basket.

I'd say buy a Bitcoin and forget about it till the halving then forget about it for another year after that. Don't invest what you can't afford to loose.

Less than 1 sadly
@_date: 2016-05-15 19:59:29
Lol nice
@_date: 2016-05-15 11:24:10
Someone clearly didn't do enough research before starting with Bitcoin 
@_date: 2016-05-15 18:51:00
Coinbase and circle are the ones that come to mind for me. But with the fees buying just a dollar really wouldn't be worth it

Lol I was saying I was the Bitcoin noob cause I am. Was saying you should toss a couple my way. I completely understand what your saying about wanting to shop relax. 
@_date: 2016-05-15 14:11:26
I'm new to the whole Bitcoin thing, depending on how this goes depends on if I'll get some for my kiddos. Not a bad move though
@_date: 2016-05-15 03:09:30
Must be nice
