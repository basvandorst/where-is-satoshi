I'm not holding a lot of btc compared to alts, but this is great news for all of us. 
Mainstream media attention combined with a perceived increased validity of bitcoin because of institutional money. I like it.

It is probably going to be publicly available around January? So until then I guess I should manage my own portfolio.

What‘s the global adaption of bitcoin? Some people from the US on this subreddit talk about their hairdessers and grandmas buying bitcoin, while here in Europe (Germany) even my nerdy friends don‘t own any.
It definitely is more widespread in the US (and Japan?) there is some talk about e.g. Venezuela, but does anyone have some actual data (e.g. traffic of exchange sites) about geographic use/ownership of bitcoin/cryptocurrency?

The general sentiment I see a lot though, is that Bitcoin (currently) resembles gold more than the USD, it functions as store of value (atm). With more scaling issies than other coins, it is not clear that btc will be the transaction currency of choice, that‘s where technology does matter. But well, I‘m very new, that‘s just what I gathered so far.
Feel free to disagree :)

Where can I read up about it some more? Googling "cr20" didn't get me anywhere.

How divers are your crypto portfolios? I very strongly believe in the future of crypto in general, but I think it‘s unclear which currency will suceed/be the best option longterm.
What‘s your ratio of bitcoin/altcoins, and which do you hold?

that is very nice, so an index fund for coins?
I'd love that, is it possible to invest in that from Europe (Germany)?
