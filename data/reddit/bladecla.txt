I bought $50 at $1300 and I've been buying ever since. That original $50 keeps me hodling on.

Is he rooting for them to fail, or is he pressuring them to fix issues that are hurting his business as well as Bitcoin itself? I'm concerned about the state of Bitcoin as it is. Can someone point out the lie and explain to me why I shouldn't be worried about the rapid growth of cryptocurrencies with superior tech?

I thought half off Bitcoin was owned by rich people? Get your Congressmen under control!

"Bitcoin Saints" is a better title.
@_date: 2014-07-12 04:43:04
it sucks because most bitcoin merchants don't typically have competitors that go by different exchanges. If I could have bought a gift card from some other site that uses Bitstamp, that would have been great.
@_date: 2014-07-14 04:50:29
But how do we know nobody paid for this article? 
@_date: 2014-05-29 08:15:14
my God. It's like the end of Scott Pilgrim vs. the World.
@_date: 2014-06-03 09:36:37
that did it. Thanks loads!
@_date: 2014-05-26 01:39:21
thank you very much! I should have thought to look for something like this.
@_date: 2014-07-14 21:03:01
you're a hero for helping us get to where we are now, but still... this hurts me 
@_date: 2014-07-12 04:40:01
I've never considered until buying something the effect of having multiple exchanges and exchange rates on prices. Now I see why people say volatility is an issue

I don't think Overstock is the way to go on this one. I would try an electronics store like: 
* Newegg.com 
* BitcoinShop 
* Scan Computers
* Millenius
* TigerDirect.com
Any place that sells cameras. Go to [spendabit]( and search for the kind of cameras your product supports.

If I had that option, I wouldn't be googling geriatric career politicians for nickels.

Maybe on the condition that the proceeds go to a known charity or fund.
@_date: 2014-06-03 06:20:18
how do I do that?
@_date: 2014-07-12 04:44:58
in contrast though, if I overpayed would there be a refund window?
@_date: 2014-05-13 05:28:26
Maybe avoid calling it "pot" though. 
@_date: 2014-07-10 06:15:59
thanks! Looks great!

I used Multibit, which goes by Bitstamp.
@_date: 2014-06-03 06:02:17
blockchain.info actually says it has over 900 confirmations, but in my wallet it's unconfirmed and can't be spent. I payed the .0001 fee. I don't understand how it can be seen by nine peers (what Multibit says) and still be pending, especially after so long.
@_date: 2014-07-19 02:06:13
okay, so then maybe not for flight crashes. But what about other causes?
@_date: 2014-05-31 22:14:40
what setting do you have on that "bullshit" will show up in Autocomplete?
@_date: 2014-04-18 21:29:06
Ok. So running a node is similar in a way to seeding a torrent? Why doesn't everyone do it? Does it take a significant amount of data to keep one up?
@_date: 2014-05-09 22:49:42
Wow! I remember neocities! They're still around?
@_date: 2014-05-30 03:54:59
dat last line tho
@_date: 2014-06-02 04:17:38
what's the difference between this and Tor?
@_date: 2014-04-26 20:28:41


Yeah, neither do we. :/

I'm not convinced the war is over yet. Bitcoin's popularity seems solely due to the fact that it was first, and it's trusted for its history in the deep web. As far as mainstream use, I think it's up to the merchants to decide what the standard will be, since a coin's value hinges mostly on how many people accept it. If a wily developer can push a coin that will be more friendly to the casual user, it could still easily take over. From what I see though, the subtle differences in altcoins are all really negligible things.  As a side note, if I could find a nifty guide that details those differences, that's be useful

No? It's a tournament of skill. They have Smash Bros. and Call of Duty tournaments, too. How is that gambling?
@_date: 2014-05-28 04:58:45
you have successfully discouraged me completely from faucets. :[
@_date: 2017-01-18 23:08:16
I bought from Coinbase through a bank transfer at $1000, turns out they make you wait a week to get your coins even after it goes through. The price immediately went up to $1100 and I got my coins at $775. 
And apparently now you can use a credit card which goes through instantly but it wouldn't accept mine for whatever reason.

I was just curious how the technology could even be used this way. And it looks like it can be, and it's not easily reversible if at all. That concerns me a little when in the USA we have a President that gets his ideas directly from the MSM in question. Since you want to talk about maintaining stupidity lol
@_date: 2018-03-20 22:30:23
I still don't exactly understand, but it sounds like they link this data together into a string for someone else to decrypt?
@_date: 2018-03-20 22:53:55
I see now. Conversion might have been the better word
@_date: 2018-04-05 01:50:06
I'm buying next week just because you said that.
