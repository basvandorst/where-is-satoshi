You can just buy them directly from your bank account?

At the moment they're selling BTC for AUD$758.40
The last trade on btcmarkets.net was AUD$739.99
So people would be buying expensive coins and then getting charged a commission on that. But what else would expect if you were buying anything from a newsagency in Australia. You pay for the human contact. I think it's great to make it easier and more mainstream. They could sell them at cafes and people could pay for their coffee with the BTC they just bought. Then people start reading a bit about it...dadadadadad....But why make it a $50 minimum? It's Bitcoin. Make it whatever they want.

I agree. I haven't commented either way ever. Just been reading all the sides views in both subbreddits.
As a non-techie I'll never be able to review the code for myself so it comes down to making decisions on who to trust. (Even though the whole point of Bitcoin is to be trustless, that is out of reach of people who can't review the code).
To me it seems obvious that the Core Devs opinions are hugely important. These are people who've been working on the project for years for no pay. Anyone can become one of them if they put the work in. What they've done is all out in the open. It's just a no-brainer that I would weight any project they pursue over other attempts to change the architecture of Bitcoin.
Of course I keep reading and evaluating for myself but in terms of which horse to back it seems obvious.
Also, I'm not a maximalist. I believe there will be (are) many coins for many use cases. And that is another form of decentralisation.

That's a good strategy. What coins are you hodling at the moment?

“We’d love to create a decentralized exchange,” says Tyler, “but … people don’t know how to do it yet at the scale and the speed required for the players in the legacy financial world.
Isn't Bitshares a decentralised exchange? Openledger or Freedomledger. And they're lickety splits.

Wouldn't it be more accurate if little parts of a limited supply of apples were growing all over the orchard?

Why on earth would anybody add another security vulnerability point by investing in a fund rather than just buying your own btc and storing it in a wallet? And paying to make it less secure...ridiculous

I'm not saying Mycelium is a scam.
I am just saying the CEO is a scammer. I would not support anything he is associated with.
@_date: 2017-05-29 11:21:40
Their CEO is a scammer. Alexander Kuzmin.
Source: Scammed me out of BTC. 
@_date: 2017-05-29 14:06:03
So Alexander Kuzmin is not the CEO of Mycelium?
Here's a source that says he is:

Did anybody commenting here actually listen to the full interview? They say MU2 is a highly risky venture and they don't let just anybody invest. You have to be a qualified investor to invest. It's not just for anybody. Sure people can maybe fake being a qualified investor but tbh then they've dug their own grave.
From the interview it sounded like bitcache is not a de-centralised service and that's what would be handling the micro-transactions. But because it's just loads of micro-transcations without holding any massive amounts of BTC it's not a security risk. They've raised 10% of what they need so far and they said they've been getting feedback on what more info investors need so maybe they'll be making more info available. 
Kim is a celebrity and MU had 200 Million users that he can market directly to. Personally I don't see why you'd bother since you can torrent stuff but if his developers have worked out a way to do micro-transactions then that's a pretty huge problem solved and because of his celebrity it could gain a lot of attraction and certainly bring bitcoin more into the mainstream. Also, it sounds like the US government has been atrociously vindictive in going after him. They mentioned a doco about him coming out in Jan which will be super interesting. Just because someone has a strange name is not a reason to disregard what he says. Maybe people should look into him more closely and not be so quick to judge.

How hard would it be for Chinese miners to change to another crypto if BTC became less profitable? If it's not hard then they can just use their resources to mine another one. Seems like a great investment on their part.

3.5 Bitcoin? Must've been a really good blend.

Core is an open source/transparent platform of development that anyone can be involved in. There's a massive difference between that and a few devs a company hired.

Do you know how to get them through holding on polo? It says to contact polo. Have polo said anything about how we can participate?
@_date: 2017-06-20 12:15:47
OK. Sorry, my mistake. I should've checked.
How many devs work on each?
EDIT: And what's the consensus process for Sewit2x?

So....did you kick yourself?
