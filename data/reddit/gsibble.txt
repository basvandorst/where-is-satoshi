Why did you get such a large and expensive SSD?  No need for that.
Also, 7970s put out about 600-700 MH/sec but you're claiming closer to 900 MH/sec.  How are you possibly driving that much power out of them?

Because brick and mortar merchants hate that use case.  They're very unwilling to adjust to new technology.  Using a card integrates with their POS, requires no new hardware, and no new training for employees.
A good example is how would you do the QR thing at a table service restaurant?  Wouldn't work well.
@_date: 2013-03-25 05:57:05
I actually have an Epson TMS-88V sitting next to me (a POS printer).  I got a QR code to print on a receipt after about a month of work.  None of the POS systems support it natively.  It required a hardware piece in between the computer and the printer.  It's crazy hard and doesn't scale :(

I really like this idea and have the technical skills to make a working prototype pretty fast.
Could someone tell me the user experience of the current SMS system so I can replicate it?  Thanks!
@_date: 2013-03-25 05:44:22
Thanks!  It's really great to see such positive reaction.  I'll keep working on it and reach out when I can use some assistance!

You should put your friend in touch with   They can make it so that his ordering will interface directly with the point of sale system at the bar.  Enjoy!

Another option would be entering a pin onto the card itself.  We have access to very advanced cards that you could encrypt like that.

A lot of good suggestions in this thread.  You're basically suggesting an online bank with a pre-funded amount available at any time.  It's basically a pre-funded line of credit.  Very similar to a debit card in some ways.
@_date: 2013-03-25 21:23:37
Most consumers don't know that.
And trust me, I'd love an interchange free network, but that wouldn't be feasible with this model........yet....... :)
@_date: 2013-03-25 05:59:00
No fees to consumers.  Fees for merchants ;)
edit:  Same way debit/credit cards make money.
@_date: 2013-03-25 09:43:47
Interchange fees would be significantly lower.  Approaching 0.5% without conversion and conversion fees of 0.5% to 1%.  Merchants can offer any discount they want.
And very easy.  This card would already work with Bitcoin and Dwolla.
@_date: 2013-03-25 03:52:43
That's part of the secret sauce.  I've figured out how to avoid the regs through a different technical solution than everyone else has been proposing.
@_date: 2013-03-25 15:58:34
I'm trying to increase merchants' acceptance of bitcoin in the real world which has basically been none.  US systems are a little different since we generally use readers directly integrated into the POS system, not PDQs.  Without giving away too much, that's where our secret sauce lies that would process the card over our network.  The banks here have absolutely no say in what cards can be used on a merchant's point of sale hardware.
You're welcome to believe that the current system is better, but the truth is that merchants don't like it.
@_date: 2013-03-25 15:55:34
You could do both.  Set a daily limit, receive notifications for all purchases, and cancel the card immediately through an iPhone app or on our website.
@_date: 2013-04-08 15:55:08
That's basically my point.
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:39:10
Caching is only part of what they do and is not how they mitigate DDos attacks.
@_date: 2013-04-08 14:51:09
I never said the payments system needs to be phone based.  I've suggested card-based BTC payment systems since no one has figured out a good phone system yet.
@_date: 2013-04-08 19:49:34
Interesting.  How do you do this without the device being connected to the internet?
@_date: 2013-03-25 09:25:11
The cards would be free for you and all consumers :)
Faulty products bought with cash have the same issue....you have to count on returning them.  As for over-charging, that's one that I'll need to figure out.

As an API provider/designer myself, they actually work quite well for APIs.
@_date: 2013-05-23 04:40:19
Their API pretty much already functions this way.

Library author here.  Happy to answer any questions you might have!
@_date: 2013-04-23 06:51:21
More often than not, at Coinbase you don't lock in the price when you purchase, the price fluctuates until the day your cash has arrived.  Their cancellation was of benefit to you.
@_date: 2013-04-25 09:34:57
Derp!  I saw much bigger!  Derp!  /sarcasm
Seriously, cool dude.
@_date: 2013-03-25 09:27:47
The card's mag stripe has a dynamically changing code on it (think RSA key) as well as a visible code that turns on with a little button (again, think RSA key).
If you lose the card, you're out of luck though until you cancel it.  That's one part I'm trying to figure out and happy to get feedback on.
@_date: 2013-03-25 06:15:00
It would take time to integrate in each country but it could get there eventually.

Not high.  A little drunk and apparently poor at explaining my concepts.
@_date: 2013-04-01 15:49:23
Well, perhaps, except your code sucks.
1.  The buy endpoint is a POST method but you're using get.
2.  The endpoint is "/api/v1/buys" not "buy" and you're missing the entire first half of the URL.
3.  You're sending your entire local variable environment as url encoded variables.  Major security issue and ineffective anyways since the only variable that the API takes is "qty".
4.  r.read() doesn't work with requests.  You're looking for r.text
So I fixed it for you:
    import requests, socket, time, json
    def buy(qty):
        url = COINBASE_ENDPOINT + '/api/v1/buys'
        params = {
            'qty': qty
        }
        while True:
            try:
                r = requests.post(url, data=json.dumps(params))
            except socket.timeout():
                continue
            data = r.json()
            if data['status'] == 'failure':
                time.sleep(60*5)    
            else:
                break
This code will be much more effective at attempting a purchase every 5 minutes using recursion instead of a loop.  Also, it works.

I was with a startup that tried to get onto the VISA/MC networks.  It's impossible.  Unfortunately, I don't see a bitcoin VISA/MC card becoming a reality anytime soon except if someone with much, much better connections than me finds a way.  But I doubt VISA/MC would want it on their networks no matter what.
Great idea though!  Would love to figure that one out.
@_date: 2013-03-25 02:06:14
Interesting thought.  I'm not sure if I would want to affiliate with him though.  Would attract a lot of unwanted attention from regulators.  Any idea how to reach him though?
@_date: 2013-03-25 04:21:49
Can only send DMs to someone that follows you.  Anyways, will tweet him.  Thanks!
@_date: 2013-03-25 09:25:37
Hopefully around 0.5%.  Much lower than CC/debit.
@_date: 2013-03-24 23:27:55
I've been thinking about this one recently and believe I have the solution.  There is a way to do it without piggy-backing on VISA/MC, maintain anonymity, and have the merchant get paid in dollars as if you were using any other card.  I started building it this weekend.  (I'm a multiple time tech entrepreneur/CEO).
I'd love some feedback on what you guys would really be looking for in terms of how to use it.  Thanks!
@_date: 2013-03-25 09:11:12
That's definitely an issue.  That's why it can be settled in dollars if they prefer.  It's just another payment network.  Takes about 30 seconds to set up on their end.  Would take a lot of sales work though indeed.
Still, very few internet merchants take Bitcoin and it's still as popular as it is.  Any brick and mortar would be a big deal.
@_date: 2013-04-08 08:33:30
$1 Trillion.
@_date: 2013-05-23 04:27:58
It would be very easy for cloud wallets with payment APIs to place a hold on Bitcoin that has been "spent" without confirmations.  For instance, double spending from Coinbase is neigh impossible.  So perhaps real world merchants will only accept from these cloud wallets.
But why are you bitching?  Stop complaining and come up with a solution.  I hate whiners.
@_date: 2013-03-25 05:24:39
That would be an option as well.
@_date: 2013-03-25 09:09:53
That's a part I'm still figuring out.  Currently, Bitcoin is much like cash.  If you lose it, it's gone.  I think the card would have to be similar.
To clarify, this is a physical card only usable at brick and mortar locations.  It has no number and cannot be used online.  And the card cannot be skimmed (the magstripe is actually a dynamic crypto key).  So the only time you would have to worry is if you lose the physical card.  Again, like cash.  But you can cancel it through an app on your phone.
@_date: 2013-03-25 15:54:21
It doesn't but I'm curious about them.  I can't find any info through Google though.
@_date: 2013-04-08 08:09:29
That's very cool.  I love Arduino and that VFD is sick!
However, we need to concentrate on making Bitcoin payments faster and easier than using a credit/debit card.  Not slower and more difficult.  Just time how long this took vs. a 2 second card swipe.  Not to mention pulling out the phone, opening my wallet app, probably putting in a PIN, etc..  There's very little marginal gain here if any apart from the use of Bitcoin.
We need to, as a community, come up with a better in-person experience else we won't see BTC adopted for in-store payments in any volume.
@_date: 2013-04-23 01:30:57
Great spot in SF.  Would love to chill with you guys sometime.  Hit me up with a message.
@_date: 2013-04-08 17:47:51
I'm saying in terms of new payment technologies, they need to focus on being better, or don't even try.  I'm happy with a card as well but most people around here seem to think that phones are better when they are not.
@_date: 2013-03-25 04:29:16
Yep, that's the idea.
@_date: 2013-03-25 05:43:00
Not a technicality at all.  Just a way in which the system works.  Would probably get regulated eventually, but wouldn't for now.
Also, you'd rather see something not happen because big companies wouldn't like it?  Seems like a rather negative approach.
@_date: 2013-04-14 22:14:22
**Update:**  I managed to convince two girls to accept it, but they didn't have their phones so they couldn't set up new accounts :(  Damn.
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:44:33
I can't.  I'm just learning they did.
Just trying to be helpful...... :(

@_date: 2013-03-25 09:11:49
Local in the US at first.  Then global.  Not sure what you mean by the 2nd part.  But the merchants can always keep the payments in bitcoin if they prefer.
@_date: 2013-03-25 15:59:56
As for mobile, we haven't seen a centralized and useful UX come out of that yet.  My example is always, how do you pay with a phone at a table service restaurant?  No one is building that yet and most of the proposals suck.
A card immediately works well with everything because people understand it as do merchants and their employees.
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:44:08
Interesting.  Shame......
@_date: 2013-04-01 06:06:32
Unfortunately I believe that is still the case.  I know Coinbase is working very hard to increase their limits.
