It was the transfer fees that fucked me over
@_date: 2018-01-02 01:42:42
no shit. I was so optimistic too, since I had my economy figured out until this shit. Didn't get an alert on my phone or anything, these bills were just there, unpaid and forgotten
@_date: 2018-01-02 01:53:41
whatever, fuck coinbase anyway

Okay, how can I place an order like that? GDAX? I want to buy x amount of bitcoin for y amount of money 
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:04:19
how do I know if  its just a dip or if i should prep for a doomsday scenario? for future reference
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:00:21
chill bro
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:04:46
The question is whether or not I should change service provider alltogether. I have 90% of my shit in mycelium but the last 10 on coinbase in case I want to sell without some stupid fucking gay ass shit fee

How would one go about betting the BTC curve? Say I want to bet it will reach 19k in three days, how would I do that? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:51:27
I have x amount of btc in mycelium right now. What is my best option to transfer in and out of mycelium without the ridiculous fees? 
Also, why would you want to withdraw from your wallet??
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:00:51

@_date: 2017-12-11 08:25:41
So if I have BTC in mycelium I can’t sell it without losing some of it because of some bullshit fee?
