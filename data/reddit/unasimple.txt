Thank you to all the people who took the time to tell us it wasn't possible lol.  The only part that needs to be centralized obviously is the initial step of fiat to crypto.  Moolah.io is doing a great job of that step.  Beyond that of course crypto to crypto DAX is very feasible as there are a number of efforts underway to achieve this as txmtx indicates.  Best of luck to you and your organization.

*scratches head*
does it involve carrier pigeons for moving paper fiat?
