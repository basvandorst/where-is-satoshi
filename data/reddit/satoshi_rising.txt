dip - bitcoin price is 15k. bitcoin price drops to 12k. bitcoin then goes on to 16k. 12k is the dip
asic - application specific integrated circuit/chip -- its a unit designed spedifically for  mining one type of digital currency. You can only mine SHA-256 coins, or Scrypt coins, etc. A gpu on the other hand can mine several types of coins as long as those coins are GPU mineable. Examples of ASIC coins: bitcoin, litecoin. Examples of GPU coins: Ethereum, FeatherCoin, VertCoin.
BTC = bitcoin.

Not sure where you live in the world as to what would be available to you. Yes, coinbase is one of the few if not the only one I know of that let’s you use a credit card. Others let you send money from your bank account via ach transfer and you fund it that way. I use gemini as an alternative because coinbase cut me off over the summer because my name wasn’t the only one in the bank account and I had no way to buy in. So I had to go put cash in a bitcoin ATM. After that experience I made sure to sign up for everything I could.
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:17:14
Check out a guy on YouTube called bitsbetripping. He shows how to build rigs and what components to use. And do some google searches for key terms like mining and gpu.
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:57:09
You can't set up a coinbase account for them. They have to do it. They also need to buy with a verified fiat source attached to their name and their name only or coinbase will freeze your account. The best you could possibly do is to buy on your coinbase account and send to external wallets you set up. Unless I am misunderstanding your comment, if so, I apologize.

Segwit can handle more transactions, simply put. So it will be better than what we are experiencing now. right now, non-segwit is limited to 1mm bytes. Segwit doubles that.

buy the dips
at this stage in the game, I would not build a rig - I would just invest in coins directly. I built a rig this spring, and even that is arguable as to whether I would have done better just straight investing the money into bitcoin when it was 1700 - i'd have more than I do today. But if you have it set in your mind to mine, then there's plenty of info. Of course you know you need an asic to mine btc, you cannot do it with a gpu, but you can mine other coins and sell those coins for btc.

The problem with coinbase is you are going to pay a percentage to coinbase for the fees, and then you'll have to make 5 separate transactions, and those will also have fees - so it will take some working out to figure out how to get exactly 20.00 to each of them. You may want to just work in satoshis and buy enough to give, plus extra to cover the costs. You can buy a bit more than you need, say you want to give 100 total you can buy 200 and have plenty left over to cover the fees (hopefully).
Coinbase is going to be your fastest way, with the exception of maybe a bitcoin ATM, but I think with the fees so high, a bitcoin ATM might not transfer the money as quickly - and in either case you stand the risk of the transaction getting stuck in limbo due to the high fees right now. 
At least on coinbase you should get a set value comparative to the going rate on bitpay, or whatever they use, and they usually tell you the fee before you buy, so you can check the mempool before the transfer to see how long your transaction might take. But keep in mind that if the mempool sees significant increase after your fee is set, you could end up in limbo until the mempool drains.
I'd start by buying the amount you need and then make paper wallets or create several addresses in the wallet of your choice and send to one of them to see if its even feasible to send anything right now, and then, at least the transaction will be pending on their end when they load the wallet and they will see a balance there. You might get lucky and have it go through fairly quick. Good luck. 
Edit: Actually with a going rate of 221000 satoshis for the avg transaction, you are going to need about 140.00 or possibly more to send all 5 transactions. And this all depends on the number of bytes for each transaction - which can vary. So I'd get 250-300 just to send 100.00 worth of BTC. Doesn't sound like a good plan right now. Maybe investigate Ethereum or LTC as those might be a better way to go until the mempool settles down. 
@_date: 2018-09-01 17:35:37
First of all go fuck yourself. Next, the buys and sells move the price. Just because bitcoin is worth 1 mm does not mean everyone who owns the coin has invested a million. There’s literally not that much money in there. It doesn’t work the way you are suggesting. Go buy a bitcoin for a million moron. I’m saying if that’s the price of bitcoin and that’s what people are paying, there’s not actually that much money in the market cap. Geez. You aren’t too good in the thinking department are ya?

@_date: 2017-12-22 22:56:18
I doubt that will ever happen. They did increase the block size technically with segwit. and would have doubled that with segwit2x. But we all know that didn't go to well. You have people who can't agree so I think the best we will get is third party layers that run on top of the block chain but you never know.
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:36:54
Don’t worry someone who has a friend  from coinbase will be on here blabbing about what the new currencies will be before it happens. Your idea is silly
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:15:35
Ok good luck but just so you know, you aren't actually mining bitcoin with nicehash, you are 'renting' your gpu to someone who is mining some alt coin and you are getting paid in btc. It's not the same as mining.

Infinity right now - the going rate is 990
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:58:50
what you are missing is that the nodes take top paying transactions first. Then lower transactions. But the top paying transactions get replaced with other high fee transactions, and those get picked over the lower fees such that those lower fees never get confirmed.

Segwit should have not been soft forked.  Now we have legacy nodes and this is where the problem stems from. If everyone were forced to upgrade to segwit we wouldn’t have to worry about backwards compatibility and we wouldn’t have 200k+transactions stuck in the mempool.

Problem with buying anywhere but bitmain is you don’t get a warranty. The reseller has the warranty and I’m not sure how that works if you had an issue, but you should check to see what kind of service the company offers, because if you have to ship it to them and then they have to ship to bitmain, you will be without for quite some time
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:24:39
I don't know, you said every article. So I asked you to link one. What terms are giving you issues? I don't understand what you want from a course... And what you mean by economics - do you mean why the price is what it is? What the different parts of the transactions are? Economics is a broad term.
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:08:56
Keep trying. It will either get confirmed on its own, or you'll get it eventually.
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:46:18
The two terms are often used interchangeably, however they can be different. I would agree with the article that bitcoin is a coin. Ethereum would be considered a coin, while cryptokitties would be a token. tokens perform some function other then strictly payment, they still can perform payment but usually rely on the main blockchain's coin in some way, like ERC20 tokens use ether(gas) - you generally can't move or spend an ERC20 token without paying some coin as a fee to do so. 
Just take your time and google stuff when you don't understand or ask specific questions on forums. I googled 'coin vs token' and found this article in under a few seconds.
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:43:28
what kind of assets
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:49:36
Yep, 39 sats per byte is enough to use the accelerator. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:41:29
I have a couple transactions that I'm sure fell out of the mempool by now and those are sitting at &lt; 10 satoshi lol. And one other one &lt; 50. So those don't have a snowball's chance in hell of getting confirmed. Hopefully this attack by Ver and company will cease soon, but now I understand why  people keep forking bitcoin - its a horrible experience to actually use it.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:36:18
That’s what segwit did, it doubled the block size. What’s your point?
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:46:28
your transactions would cancel and you would not get any bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:31:23
You can't mine bitcoin on a gaming pc, but what you can do is use a mining program and get paid in btc. I assume that is what you mean. Your parts should be fine, but your profits would vary depending on that you have in that gaming pc.

The fiat money is too damn high. 
@_date: 2018-08-31 14:25:11
All it takes is one transaction to set the price. You do know the market cap is reflective of what someone paid for the asset not what everyone actually has? So if a coin is worth 1.00 and all of a sudden the price jumps to 1mm it doesn’t mean all the money in the world got sucked magically into this coin.
