You're not.
@_date: 2017-09-17 18:26:11
Trying to avoid acknowledging your mistake? Serious question.
@_date: 2017-09-17 13:34:51
Well it's not immoral in the first place, so it can't get any less so.

Wow, you are a genius! Taxes have existed since the dawn of civilisation and yet no-one has ever thought of that before...
@_date: 2017-09-17 14:09:20


Maybe I shouldn't have put that part in brackets, because you seem to have skipped over it.
@_date: 2017-09-17 14:02:08
Theft is defined as the criminal act of depriving a person of their property. Taxation cannot be theft because it is not a criminal act.
(Protip: You whining that something is a crime doesn't make it so, the law does.)

Cool. Completely irrelevant, however.
@_date: 2017-09-17 11:01:06
One would assume naivety lessens with age.
@_date: 2017-09-17 18:17:20
Perhaps you should be paying more attention, because I haven't given any argument, I've only pointed out the flaw in yours.
@_date: 2017-09-17 17:59:54
Protip: Know the definition of words if you're going to use them.

Translation: "I have no argument so I'm going to call you a troll."
@_date: 2018-12-19 18:53:58
More evidence that you don't know what the words you use mean. Maybe when you're an adult.
@_date: 2018-12-17 14:58:54
I'm acting smart by repeating your own words? Maybe next time don't talk nonsense that you can't back up.
Protip: The hacking scenes on NCIS are not a documentary.
@_date: 2018-12-16 22:16:26
So you hack me by doing everything except hacking me.
@_date: 2018-12-15 19:02:51
I'm asking you how I get hacked. You're the one that made the claim.
@_date: 2018-12-19 02:53:03
Somehow, I doubt your ballsack has ever been in someone's face.
@_date: 2018-12-21 14:19:09
Why would I want to learn how to be a girl from someone who's never touched a girl?
@_date: 2018-12-15 02:54:37
I have 19.81 BTC. Now please explain how anyone is going to 'hack' me.
@_date: 2018-12-19 11:57:25
Again, something that has never happened to you in real life.
@_date: 2018-12-17 19:29:05
What exactly are you whining about? More deflection from the fact that you don't know what the word 'hack' means.
