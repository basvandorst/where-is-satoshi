Remember that Vegeta one?

It did this last year this time as well as end of 2015. When it happened in 2015 I did sell a lot only to regret it later. It’s going to happen again around beginning of May for the first 3 weeks where it will take off.
Am sure there is data out there to refer to.
I for one has been anticipating this, I knew it was coming and am sure there are others out there who is aware of this. It is a known known if we (or at least I) refer to past performance.
Also nothing much has happened in the world of BTC it is still the same thing regardless of Futures exchanges,scams, bankruptcy etc. It is what it has always been therefore all should remain the same with an adjustment for greater adoption and interest.
And like I said...past performance.

I don’t know why am getting downvotes but anyone who has been into cryptos and especially BTC knows it dips usually this time of the year, this is when it dips the most and then recovers thereafter....like that shouldn’t be disclosed to newbies? 
Anyway it is an “investment” of some kind subject to risks and anything can happen.

Just came here to say, I'd never buy anything with my  BTC. Its for keeps forever. For as long as I can hold on to them or profit from them from speculating.

Fuck I dont understand what is going on and all I know is that the value of my BCH is decreasing and I cant tell what the future will be but I think am fucked. At what point do I pull off the plug and take losses people?
@_date: 2017-08-23 11:04:48
What does that mean for BCH?

@_date: 2018-02-06 08:54:51
We all live in democratic governments, if we want cryptos why don't we just tell them to accept it as it is what people want?
