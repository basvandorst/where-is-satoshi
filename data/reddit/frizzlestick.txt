His profits aren't the concern, though.    His taking his retirement and savings from a family that depends on him, and dumping it into BTC - is the concern.    Him gambling his family's future.
If he pulls out the amount he used to invest into BTC initially, he's still ahead of the game.   It's over double in value for him.     He'll have tons of BTC left over to "play with" - without risking his financial future.
BTC may or may not be around next week or next year or ten years from now.   Something else may come along.   It might get bad press and wither and die on the vine.   The value of a BTC might just tank.   Someone might cash out their big pile of BTCs and crash the value (hell, that's what I'd do right now if I was OP.   Put in 30k, get out 280k in a short-turnaround).   
Short answer:  Never put all your eggs in one basket.   **Never.**
As fun as BTCs are as currency, they're not legal tender - and it's legal tender that will pay for me and my family finances after retirement.    If this guy wants to turn a profit - he just did.   If he looks at BTC like stocks - he bought low, he should sell high.
The day I see a BitCoin Market on Wall Street like a Stock Market - is the day I'll consider ever telling anyone to consider using BTCs as a retirement investment tool.

Exactly this.   **Exactly this**.   Convert whatever BTCs itd be to pull out $30k USD and pay that loan back.   Then and only then can your BTC investment be considered a "fun little experiment".   Until then it's a "financial nightmare for people who depend on you".
There's absolutely no reason he shouldn't pull out enough BTC to pay back that 30k loan.  If anything for peace-of-mind.

Did you try using more than one year in your calculations?   At what point does the value of the bet skew the formula?   (ie., $1 bet vs. $200 bet, dorking up your formula) - since I'm assuming it can't be a linear calculation - at some point, your interference is going to affect the outcome.

This is a million years old - and I enjoyed your starter guide.   I did have a question as I was reading through this thread, with everyone throwing tips around.   
What determines the value weight of a bitcoin?   Like above, gave you 0.5 BTC which weighed in at $13.41 USD.
How does bitcoin handle inflation, or simple value.  What keeps 1BTC from being worth $0000.01 USD at some point?      I know in the write up there is only 21M BTCs in play, but being infinitely divisible (0.02 BTC or 0.0002 BTC) means there's an unlimited amount of BTCs to throw around.

...or doesn't find a buyer at all.   The whole crux of it, the unspoken part of it (beyond BTCs being hacked, or a run on confidence and the bottom falls out) - is that it's not legal tender, and that's what your day-to-day turns on.    
It's better to look at BTCs as a product, not a currency.  Something where there's a limited amount of, like mint baseball cards.    If there's only been X of them in play, the value can increase.   If I've been whoring a whole huge pile of them and try to walk into an auction house - I'd crash the value, even at offering time.
It's absolutely no different than using jellybeans as currency.
The day we see a Bitcoin Market up on Wall Street, or that I can go to an ATM or a Holiday gas station and give them BTCs - is the day this will work with future confidence.
Until then, it's all trading jellybeans.   Hoping that someday, Walmart will accept jellybeans as payment for goods.    The likelihood of that?  
That phrase, "Legal Tender" on the USD means *a lot*.
(I'm not knocking BTCs, I'm talking reality.  We all want to see BTCs take off, but in reality unless you have a stable, insured system of converting it to legal tender, you're just trading jellybeans)

There's a bloke I work with that plays with daytrading penny stocks.  He's not doing it to get rich (well, I suppose he secretly hopes he does) - but he's doing it to practice at Stock Market: The Game, with little risk exposure.
If things roll right, there comes a point when your weekly scratch-off investment tips into something that needs consideration because it's a bigger return than "oh golly, I just made a few dollars".   Here's hoping you get to that point.   Cheers!
