Yep. There are tons of apps available ( for android, for example). Just meet in person and make an instant transaction. Not too many people are going to know what it is, so I would include in your listing some of the popular sites for learning about btc &amp; buying some.

Logged in the other day and saw this  No transactions or anything showed this BTC in my account, and I only had ~.44btc myself on Coinbase. Why was somebody elses bitcoin available on my account? Good going Coinbase

It's very hard to determine your lucky number if you do it via blockchain or something. The best way is to manually send to the address you want with a value like .11 or something you can recognize.

When dealing with Paypal, make sure you call every single day and re-explain the story to as many people as possible. Eventually they will give you, the seller, what you want because there is a verified shipping address. The process will not be simple, but eventually you'll speak to somebody there who actually wants to help you. It took me 15-20 calls before talking to somebody willing to actually do something.

The website would work just fine, but there is a pretty awesome iOS app

I had quite the opposite problem. Got a bunch of random emails, logged into check my coinbase account and I had ~850BTC that had no logs of ever being put into my account. Needless to say, CoinBase is still trying to figure out how they got there :)
