There is a difference between nominal and real terms. Nominally if you split a dollar into a 100 pieces it will be a 100 pieces nominally. If the value of the dollar goes up or down then the value if the 100 pieces changes in real terms.

Yet it doesn't match reality. Technology is deflationary with stuff getting cheaper and cheaper. People aren't waiting forever for prices to hit the floor to finally buy. They buy as prices fall. We can also look at light production. It would take several days labor buy a crude candle that wasn't very bright and lasted several hours. If deflation as a reality we're true we would still be waiting for light prices to go down. LED light bulbs are still getting cheaper and the floor hasn't hit yet. But that is not the reality we live in. People bought more efficient brighter and longer lasting candles and then light bulbs as prices went down.

The wild West was a myth. It was pretty tame. In some places they had lower rates of crime than in modern times. The book."The not so wild West" expands in this. 
The 1929 crash was causes by artificially low interest rates.
The US government followed the doctrine of economic progress outweighs individual harm. Through this doctrine companies were shielded from lawsuits by workers. Courts would throw out workers lawsuits. With the protection of the government, companies created dangerous working conditions.

Yet under today's system undisclosed chemicals are rampant. Today I was at the store trying to figure out if a certain brand of coconut oil had trans fats or was hydrogenated. Our current system allows for trans fats to not be disclosed. Also let's look at olive oil. Olive oil is is cut with other unknown cheaper inferior oils. Yet no mention of this is made on the packaging.

Changes in half a percent can have massive effects shows that the financial system is leveraged to the gills. A small breeze can have a devistating effect on the economy.This is clearly unsustainable. We live in an era of very low interest rates. Historical rates have been closer to 15-18% not this range of 2-4%.
Obviously you want to preserve the unsustainable system that benefits the rich and screws over the middle class and those on fixed income like the elderly. Deflation isn't the monster you make it out to be.the real monster is inflation that erodes value and increases prices compounded over a period of decades. A modest inflation target of 5% yearly compounded over 10 years can have a devistating effect on savings and purchasing power.

Saying something is one thing and actually doing something is completely different. Hedge funds have been shown to have historically bad returns yet the industry is bigger than ever. Index funds have shown to outperform hedge funds but they are a small investment class. If the SP 500 play was so obvious where are the huge list of people who got rich buying and holding for decades? Your using hindsight and ignoring everything in between that happened like economic uncertainty, investor psychology, geopolitical events, big drops in the market, recessions.

In a deflationary system purchasing power increases.people can buy more goods with the same amount of money. This is opposed to the inflationary model where purchasing power erodes over time.People invest depending interest rates of savings or yields coming from different financial instruments. You ignore that while advocating an unsustainable consumption economy with disregard to savings. Hoarding money is called savings.
Savings are the foundation for capital. The amount of capital is determined by interest rates.The higher the interest rate the higher the capital available to business and consumers. Once again you completely ignore savings as capital and how that affects interest rates.
You dislike deflation and  implicitly advocate for inflation. But you claim time preference as no basis in reality.You throw out your own argument against deflation when you do that. WTF are you smoking?
The common man benefits from deflation. Higher purchasing power. That is opposed to the inflationary model that benefits the rich whose assets rise in value and their loans become cheaper.
People flip out over planned austerity measures that were never implimented or servery reduced.

The article is based on the Reuters article. Governments have seized and restricted outflows of precious metals. Laws targeted at fighting terrorism have been used on citizenry. It's not hard to infer that in times of capital crunch that the EU would use their new found powers to seize non terrorist gold. In the US this is legal already under precident set by FDR, patriot act, and civil forfeiture.

Technology is deflationary yet people buy it all the time. This idea of people holding on to their money because of possible decrease in price doesn't bear out. We are humans with different rates of satisfaction. We don't do analysis of macroeconomic factors Everytime we buy something. If the deflation monster was real we would never buy tech because it will always be cheaper.
Our current inflationary system benefits the rich. Their asset classes rise while their loans become cheaper in real terms. The middle class gets screwed with eroding purchasing year after year. Deflation raises the purchasing power of people. People can buy more stuff with the same money.
The acquisition of capital would come from interest rates from savings. Higher interest rates would encourage people to save.That savings would be loaned out as capital.

Looking back, it's easy to make that statement.in the trenches you would have no clue whether the long term rally was beginning or ending or if there was a long term rally in the first place.

You call that a terrible statement by Trump? Your stretching hard there. I can think of several technology related gaffs that Trump made. 
I'll play your game. Recently Trump said “We will stop racing to topple foreign regimes that we know nothing about, that we shouldn’t be involved with,” further stating that the US military is overstretched "because we're all over the place fighting in areas that we shouldn't be fighting in."

Yet Obama didn't do shit to reform civil forfeiture for 8 years and he is still in power. Hillary on the other hand cheerleaded the acceleration of the police state in the 90s. When she was in the Senate she was quiet about civil forfeiture. Only when she was running did she say anything.

Keep on overreaching. Hate to break it to you, most politicians speeches for decades have been written by speech writers. This includes Obama who uses teleprompters heavily.
You reach for any little thing and try to blow it up. If you want to be consistent then completely discount anything any politician including Obama says whenever they use a teleprompter.

They were cheerleading the housing bubble. They mocked those who said that there was a housing bubble. They denied that there was going to be correction. They repeated the mantra of green shoots. Repeating whatever Alan Greenspan said instead of grilling him about his contributions to the housing bubble. It's an echo chamber for pundits and analysts who keep making the wrong calls.  
Even now they are cheerleading the stock market while it makes unprecidented gains. They don't question it. Nothing's suspicious about a rally that only has a few big companies making gains while the rest of the companies have slow grow or flatline growth.

Inflation screws over the poor, those on fixed income, savers, and those trying to build wealth over generations. Even a modest 2% yearly inflation over the course of 5 years erode purchasing power by 10%. Over 10 years purchasing power is eroded by 20%. The US dollar from 1912 to now has eroded 97%. Inflation is a good thing has brought the erosion of the middle class and has created an unsustainable consumption economy.

People with debt love inflation. It devalues in real terms the amount they have to pay back. It also increases the value of the assets they bought with the debt. Due to economies of scale the rich benefit from this system. The poor and middle class meanwhile see their currency lose value year after year. The rich get richer and the poor get poorer. You need to take an economic class. Your looking through the world with the same paradigm that has created this flawed economy of oligarchs and bankers.
