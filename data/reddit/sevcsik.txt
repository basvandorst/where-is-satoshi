There's a pub around accepting BTC for years. They accept the broadcast, they don't wait for confirmation.

I suspect this video is fake.

It's called shorting :)

If someone says "bitcoins" you know they cannot be taken seriously. "BitCoins" is a bit worse.

I don't think this constant debate of Bitcoin/Bcash/Bcore etc. leads anywhere. We should start accepting the fact that there is no such thing as the "true Bitcoin' in a decentralised world, but each party can have its own version of the "truth".

That's the point of HW wallets. You can plug it in an unsafe machine, because the private keys never leave the device. If there is a malware which compromises the wallet software, you get notified because you have to confirm the transaction on the HW wallet.

Isn't that what Steem is supposed to be? I don't know how decentralised is it in practice though.

as long as you trust the manufacturer of the lock your paper wallet is behind :)

couldn't agree more. Most of the hodlers just see an investment opportunity in Bitcoin, not the revolutionary technology and the poteintal to change the society. If we keep seeing bitcoin and other cryptos as a means of hoarding money, it will be nothing but a bubble. The real value comes from the utility, and that means spending it.

Bitcoin doesn't belong to this list. It is the next evolutionary step after Uber, Facebook, etc.
