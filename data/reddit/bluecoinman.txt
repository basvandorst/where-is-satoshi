Dogecoiners would be interested in a diarrhea puddle as long as it resembled  a fat dog.

I have found that if you have to spend a lot of time explaining bitcoin to someone that someone isn't really going to get it.  
The best you can do is lay out some basics, give them a few sites to read up on, and let them go. Answer any specific questions they have.
But yea, you're not going to have some one "get it" by showing them a powerpoint slide or some shit.

Obviously, I wouldn't take anything as gospel just because I read it on reddit :)
But there are a lot of smart people here and I figure that *someone* probably has some experience with this sort of thing.

Actually, yes it does.

I sold some bitcoin at the height of the 2011 bubble to "break even" on my GPUs for mining.
I wish I still had those coins :(

I'd be curious to know the customs cost for US shipping. This is dope as fuck.

If you don't hold the private keys, you don't really own the coins.

Why are you so dedicated to being a bad person?

Bitcoin or bust. Say no to all the scam coins!

You're really not the brightest colored crayon in the box.

Litecoin is the ultimate pointless coin.  Dogecoin looks like a paradigm shift compared to litecoin.

Here's a pro tip: If it deals with altcoins you're gonna get robbed eventually.

Dogecoin is obviously the superior coin!

Only true coin!

LTC is still a scam with it's only goal to be the collapse of all Bitcoin and, thusly, the cryptocoin experiment.  You find me an intellectually honest litecoiner and I'll give you a thousand BTC.
