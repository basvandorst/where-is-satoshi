Oh you have a bitcoin mining rig?
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:02:03
What does this achieve? 
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:05:02
Well most of it is the media and the people around facebook to be honest. Even I'm trying to encourage my friends to invest just at least $20. To no luck, can't convince them
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:06:13
I can feel a crash soon.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:18:19
what do you know guys, it just got lower. I'm buying btc again. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:05:41
That's true. Invest what you can lose. It's a lot like gambling.
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:45:11
it's playing at $18600. The question is will it go down further
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:11:25
Ah yeah I did. Sad I can only put in $20
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:01:12
Huuuuh? Really? This is a technique? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:48:39
What's FUD? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:49:42
I SOLD 100% OF MY BITCOIN. THIS IS STRESSFUL HAHA
@_date: 2017-12-02 04:20:10
This is true. Pyramid schemes are the biggest scams but no one seems to bat an eye. 
 But some people are actually asking the right questions. I simply don't have answers to them. Hahah
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:41:59
Bitcoin is seriously moody. :))
@_date: 2017-12-04 05:04:39
I wanna see where this goes. Good luck man!
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:02:47
The dip was just like 5 hours then it went back up. I was hesitating to buy :((
@_date: 2019-10-24 12:15:46
lol. HODL! Putting in money now!
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:06:47
That's true. And once they know what bitcoin is, blam! new users incoming, bitcoins rising once again.
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:03:34
Well, I'm sure yep. They've lost homes to a lot of gambling with horses and cards.
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:03:03
huh. okay did not expect it to go down at 9500 again. It's a good thing I didn't buy yet
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:27:45
Trying my best to prevent myself from selling the bitcoin. Impulse selling
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:30:48
this is noted. I will try my best to stop myself from selling
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:30:26
as long it's money you can lose. Go for it!
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:41:51
So do I dip in now at $10400? What did you guys do?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:38:50
buying low and selling high is my game.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:13:34
So to I buy some or do I sell now?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:27:32
Trying my best to prevent myself from selling the bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:18:10
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. DO I SELL MY BITCOIN NOW OR HOLD ON
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:24:12
Ours isn't down yet.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:18:28
Hello 10k I missed you
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:30:33
HAHA. It's 3:30AM here and I'm looking at everything. Can't buy at the moment because banks are still closed :((
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:05:58
Well bitcoin is very volatile and people are actually having fun buying and just HODL everything whenever it dips. I myself panicked and am guilty at last night's dip. HAHA. That's why I call it a game for us people. It's a bit of a gamble to be honest.
Ah that's true. Maybe they can't really build their trust on bitcoin yet. Maybe? or are they really that scared to look into bitcoin right now?
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:19:18
well it was on a lower price 30 minutes ago
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:24:45
hopefully that's what happens
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:44:26
9200 again. it's stable.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:53:47
It was stable 10 minutes ago. lol
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:53:30
I've always got good predictions. I just don't do it. Mostly I'm right. I'm rarely wrong.  *sighs*
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:34:49
that's true. I actually computed my last Cash out. I actually lost some money. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:31:10
It's slowly going up already.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:27:00
sorry what is HODL?
