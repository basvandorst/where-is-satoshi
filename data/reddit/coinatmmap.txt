coinatmradar has been the **only** option for a long time. Our goal is to be the most accurate Bitcoin ATM Map on the internet. We do this by verifying the locations submitted to our website and only featuring operators that offer the highest quality services. We also want to make it easy for you to find and share locations. This is why we have included features like "Text Me Directions" so you can easily share directions with your friends and family. For operators, we made it easy to upload and export locations. Operators also have their own showroom page where they can upload information that is useful to their customers ([  Right now we are only tracking the Top Operators in the US but, we will be adding Canada and Europe soon.  We just launched a couple weeks ago and we will continue adding features and updating the information on our site. Check us out and let us know what you think.

Yes, there are many ways for people to purchase Bitcoin online but, all of these require you to have a bank account or credit card. Online services also take a couple days to transfer funds and to get on-boarded .  Bitcoin ATMs are the safest and most convenient way to purchase Bitcoin for Cash. There are no wait times. As soon as you finish the transaction your Bitcoin will be available in your wallet once its confirmed on the Blockchain. We believe having different options to purchase BTC makes the Bitcoin ecosystem stronger ��

coinATMmap does not operate Bitcoin ATMs. We are a directory for Bitcoin ATM locations. If you wish to host a Bitcoin ATM in your store we can help you get in contact with an operator in your area. Just got to: [

To operate a large Network of Bitcoin ATMs  across multiple states you must run an efficient operation. This means you can't cut corners when it comes to compliance, customer service, user on-boarding, maintenance, etc.  We currently follow the 9 largest because they have proven to do this.  This doesn't mean that smaller operators don't follow the same standards.  If you're a Bitcoin ATM operator and want to have your locations featured on our site please apply on our website under the "Register"  tab.

Don't worry 99.99% of Bitcoin ATMs sell Bitcoin.

We just launched a few weeks ago and currently have the Top Nine operators on our site (Organized by Machine Count).  They all differ in the coins they offer, their on-boarding procedures, their locations, and more. But all of them follow ethical practices and are compliant in the states they operate in.
