Best lifehack ever, love it!

Quickly, where is Mr. Satoshi's shrinking machine.
@_date: 2018-05-28 19:13:09
Or just money laundering.
@_date: 2018-05-25 08:27:45
But will they ever be mined or is it build like the story with The hare and the tortoise?

How do you write it, how do they, i mean BitCoin bitcoin BITCOIN...
@_date: 2018-05-28 19:44:11
Imagine how easy it is to hold a couple of million or trillions dollars in bitcoin, safe and secret compared to real money.
If we get another rise as last time Imagine what all those bitcoins owned by criminals would be worth.
I don't have any numbers, just pure speculation.

Do you know the site   Thay have many different bulletins for Product Designers, maybe there is something BTC related.
@_date: 2018-05-30 02:55:31
I've spend thousands of hours making BitCoin and one sock is all I got out of it!?
@_date: 2018-06-08 08:54:41
I love the way Michael Sonnenshein explains it in this video.
@_date: 2018-06-13 03:04:19
I say in max two months and than upwards, you?
@_date: 2018-06-12 13:28:23
Well I'm not swiss, I haven't heard about it before, I think it's fascinating, and I'm going to use the idea in many discussions.
@_date: 2018-06-12 12:37:42
I think people just don't understand BlockChain yet.
@_date: 2018-06-17 10:36:40
This is just one of many proofs that none of those rich wall street sociopaths are intelligent in any way. They are just well suited to navigate the hierarchy structures of society.
@_date: 2018-06-08 23:25:41
Strange, right... Cryptomining king goes fiat.
@_date: 2018-06-15 17:40:48
I've always wanted to design a paper money note
@_date: 2018-06-12 12:35:51
I know, but now the idea is out there. And those assholes need regulations if any.
@_date: 2018-06-18 10:54:05
I have been wondering the same. As the [difficulty increases]( all the time, so unless the bitcoin will be worth mining when the difficulty gets high enough. Who will Authenticate transactions or will it just drive the price up like the hodlers think?
@_date: 2018-06-16 09:18:23
Why are the fines so low, it's their coffee budget... 
@_date: 2018-06-04 10:58:25
Yes, that's true, and how strange is that, Google has so many small strange projects going, and as you say... Are they maybe just separated and started up outside?
@_date: 2018-06-08 18:19:47
If this becomes a success more banks will follow suit... Very interesting.
@_date: 2018-06-13 09:13:03
At least it not 50&amp; like the 1&amp; in the real world owns...
@_date: 2018-06-18 14:16:44
Thank you :)

I remember it as a series of articles I think on yayhooray or something alike, about some new fangled idea some understood but most of us just pretended to. The idea to make BitCoin with your PC, when you were not using it was appealing, it didn't take much to start and probably most people that did get their first many bitcoins couldn't use them and either sold them early on or just threw them out. i had over 14 BTC which got thrown out long time ago, when it wasn't worth the bother selling them.
But year after year it actually grew, and it grew more than anyone had thought it would and it is almost there in the public eye.
@_date: 2018-06-04 10:45:21
I await the day Google actually invent something by them selves, not even their search engine was new. 
@_date: 2018-06-08 12:06:57
I don't think you will see an upturn that big until Dec. It is said 5.500 befor it turns.

As we all know, as soon Bitcoin can be used in the sex industry, we are golden :)
@_date: 2018-06-18 13:15:23
So the difficulty correlates to the hashing power, the more mining force the higher that difficulty, and the other way around, is that rightly understood?
@_date: 2018-06-08 23:06:27
As always it came from the underground, and was such a strange beast, that the whole nerd community couldn't do anything but look, and got drawn in by promises of gold and green lands, and in this magic creation, it all held true...
@_date: 2018-06-18 14:14:49
Sorry, what whitepaper?
I didn't actually know that, so thanks... I had missed another tidbit about the halving block content from 50 to 25 to 12.5 ... So as I understand it, in the future, mining empty blocks for verification will be more profitable than mining for the last bitcoin blocks... but the empty blocks already exist but are not profitable to mine or will they come into existence later?. 
@_date: 2018-06-18 14:37:06
Ok, thanks for the link, I have read to many post and articles, I need something logical :)
@_date: 2018-06-11 11:01:58
Dammit, i also hoped my 1 dollar investment yesterday would be 1 million worth today, daddy needs a new haircut... stupid Crypto
@_date: 2018-06-12 11:42:41
For me the most essential part is this.


This would be a much needed regulation of the banking industry.

i think 5200 is the lowest, but we will see soon.
