That’s not Bitcoin, though.

\*kudos to Lisk for making a bunch of these definitions (r/

Nope. Just invalid data from the cryptocompare API (their price source).

Yeah, see, that's what I initially thought too, but that brings me to question why it would've changed from "digital payment network," to, "cash." I doubt the Wikipedia changed that much in the last few months to warrant such a change in Google search results.

Have to say, though, the Ethereum version is way more visually stimulating.

Useless; no dogecoin.

Here, take this internet cookie. ��

Also a bit confused by the fact that Google classifies Bcash as, 'Change.' Anyone have any ideas as to why Google would refer to Bitcoin as 'Cash,' and Bcash as, 'Change?'
@_date: 2018-06-16 03:22:48
I believe it was "digital payment network."

I don't think you guys understand how interest rates work.

����‍♀️ Today was the first time I heard it. I’ve heard ‘Bitcoin Core’ before, but this was the first time I’ve ever heard Bcore.

Wasn’t 2017 the massive hype year?

Think it's bills only.

Neat idea: mine Bitcoin yourself. You’re not using PayPal to trade with some stranger or using a centralized exchange to acquire bitcoin, but just paying your electricity provider for service.

This actually does exist, though. The Ti 84 CE ++, one of the most common graphing calculators, has full C++ support and, thus, full Bitcoin cold wallet support.

He literally just explained why he’s angry; you posted something unrelated to Bitcoin in the Bitcoin subreddit.
@_date: 2019-01-25 13:00:37
There are actually a few different implementations for the 84 CE ++. None of them for the 84++ can publish transactions, though (can still generate and store private keys+offline sign TX); you’d need to go for one of the more expensive models for internet connectivity.

Just stop. It was funny the first 12 times, but not anymore.
