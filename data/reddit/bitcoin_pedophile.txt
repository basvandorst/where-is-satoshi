Still a long way from 100 responses, but here is an indication of some of the results so far:
I'll probably repost the link here tomorrow for further responses

Nothing, but this isn't exactly a therapy session is it?
It's just a simple survey

It will give some indication about how Bitcoin has affected people and their personal relationships.
Personally I'm interested in seeing what proportion of people are experiencing negative symptoms, and which ones they have been experiencing.


You're going to need to be more specific brah
Also, this isn't meant to be in-depth. I deliberately designed it to be simple so as to at least get a sizable number of responses before it's downvoted into deletion by people like you. If this happens, I might just repost it a few times until I get enough responses.

Not saying you're one of them, but I'll point out that making responses designed to skew the results one way or the other are typically pretty easy to detect and set aside in analysis after the fact.
Whilst it's anonymous, you can easily identify fakes which are either all-positive or all-negative and were answered in ~20 seconds.

Bitcoin is a speculative commodity, not a currency.
But yes, any investment can affect psychological health, particularly if it's a volatile one and/or you've lost a lot of money.
This survey isn't just a joke, I'm legitimately interested in seeing how many people are experiencing these symptoms.

OMG I never realized that!!
How could I be such an ignorant fool all this time, when the answer was right under my very nose?

Well looking at what seem like valid responses (i.e. mixed, or only 2 or 3 checked answers), the response time is on average about a minute.
There's only two responses so far I'm unsure about. One is 'anxiety' + 'remained the same' with a time of 20 seconds. The other is an overwhelmingly negative one made in 29 seconds, but oddly with the 'impulsive thoughts/behaviour' unchecked.


Actually that isn't the case at all. A good number of seemingly genuine responses have skipped the personal relationships question, indicating that it has had no effect on their personal relationships.
Interestingly, while the majority of responses include one or two negative symptoms, they also tend to claim that overall Bitcoin has improved their psychological health 'for the better'.


I don't think these are particularly relevant causes, nor is it the intention of the survey to establish the causes.
I suspect it wouldn't really matter if you bought in at $1241 or $800 - obviously if you're up you're more likely to be happy, and if you're down you're going to have more negative symptoms, but the amount by which you're down or up doesn't really make much of a difference.
It's also worth noting that regardless if you're up or down, (I suspect) you're likely to be experiencing anxiety and the like anyway. Especially with the wild swings in price over the past few months, which means that if you bought in at $400+ you've been at a loss at some stage.
