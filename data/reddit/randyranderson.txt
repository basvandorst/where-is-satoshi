A good deal if I’ve ever seen one

As am I

Isnt this log linear trend breaking a bit?

I think putting your faith in high value entities is dangerous. They stand to gain as much by price drops as with price jumps. Without a change in fundamentals or public perception things aren’t going to change for the better. In fact I think the saying “no news is good news” doesn’t apply at all here. No news is actually bad news. People will inevitable give up and leave their positions for more profitable investments.

I had another engineer look at what you said and we couldn’t make sense of your calculation’s physical significance.
@_date: 2019-09-01 06:22:13
Right thanks. I think I’ve heard of him before but I’m not familiar with his work
@_date: 2018-07-05 23:28:58
But it could be argued that the supply is increasing right? Difficulty began to increase exponentially this last December around the same time as the price drop started. I think demand dropped around that time too but I think demand dropped as a result of the price dropping, which made things worse for the bitcoin market.

I’ve been really scouting the web for info but couldn’t find any solid news. I don’t subscribe to the beliefs in charts either. But I think I will focus more on development like you said. You had good advice so thank you
@_date: 2018-07-17 19:23:57
Welll this is more just a warning not to listen to them
@_date: 2019-09-01 14:54:19
Now that’s a lot of info haha it’ll take me a bit to work through that. Did you happen to have all the links available or are you a google sage?
@_date: 2019-09-02 03:41:17
Thank you haha
@_date: 2019-09-01 20:41:16
I totally agree. It was a gross simplification but I was trying to make a basic point about demand. I understand your point now and it makes sense.
@_date: 2019-09-01 14:42:37
That’s hilarious he called it that. Thanks for the input tho
@_date: 2018-07-06 00:43:36
Fair enough. I’m not sure where I’m going with this
@_date: 2019-09-01 07:00:43
Thanks. You’re right. It is very insightful
@_date: 2019-09-01 06:03:44
Interesting point but I feel like it’s comparing apples to oranges
@_date: 2019-09-01 06:16:23
Hey man don’t get defensive. I’m just trying to play the devils advocate to try to get greater perspective. It’s a learning experience for me. Reddit is a great source of info
@_date: 2019-09-01 06:31:57
Good point
@_date: 2019-09-01 06:20:12
That’s very convincing
@_date: 2019-09-01 19:22:43
I’d like to think I’m good at math considering I’m an engineer. I don’t know what you are trying to calculate but it looks like you you just divides total bitcoin transaction volume in terms of USD by the maximum amount of bitcoin.
The only other way I could think of it is you are trying to calculating the fraction of bitcoin that is being transacted each day and you’re multiplying it by the btcusd exchange rate.
These concepts are equivalent and I don’t think they mean anything significant.
@_date: 2019-09-01 05:46:16
You raise good points. My main issue with what you say however is that you assume adoption is guaranteed. Who does it benefit? I also don’t see the USA’s gov or any other stable governing body really liking bitcoin. 
Your comparison to the internet itself is worth examining in detail too. I’ll look into that.
@_date: 2019-09-01 19:32:12
I’m beginning to think you don’t understand that the statistic has no significance. For instance why are you using 21 million bitcoin? 21 million usable bitcoin don’t even exist. Many have been lost. I’ve read many different sources indicate that millions of bitcoin have been lost due to forgotten passwords and etc. 
You also explained what the values are that you use to calculate. You don’t explain what you are calculating really. Or why you manipulate those values in such a way.
@_date: 2019-09-02 03:44:05
Ah okay. I thought you were mentioning the buy/spend/sell as mentioned in the white paper and were extrapolating that equation based off your own thoughts.
@_date: 2019-09-01 14:41:09
Thanks for your input amigo

As someone else mentioned, Older Pokémon cards also have a limited supply. So sure they could increase in value with demand. But if the demand for Pokémon cards stagnates because only a certain non-growing group is interested in it, then the price might not go up anymore. 
At any moment there’s a limited number of pens in the same room as you. That doesn’t mean their value will increase over time unless Jordan Belford happens to walk into the room and he wants to sell them.
@_date: 2019-09-02 04:33:15
I didn’t read it because I thought you were only using it as a very basic jumping to go to your math. I will read it shortly however because i think this sort of talk is useful to gain insight into bitcoin. I might as well read the white paper since I’m actually interested in bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-09-01 14:52:24
I’m going to be honest, I don’t really follow where you are going with your math. Are you trying to estimate price by saying the total dollar denominated transaction volume in 24 hours divided by the total bitcoin float is  that number?
@_date: 2018-07-05 23:59:43
It doesn’t chance on a basis of roughly every two weeks but if for example mining increased significantly and the 2016 blocks were mined in a week then would you not have an increased supply? I’m not suggesting the miners control price or even that the average number of coins mined changes. I’m saying it fluctuates on a basis of every two weeks. Bitcoins price is obviously unstable and fluctuating hash rates within a two weeks period could change supply. Also I’m not denying the macroeconomic trends. But I am just suggesting that the mining rates affect on supply isn’t necessarily insignificant. Of course, this is all for the sake of discussion. Just a thought I had today
