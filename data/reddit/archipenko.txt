A user set percentage limit that prevents more than that percentage of total BTC owned being transferred. For example, I own 100 BTC and I set my limit to 60% I can only move or transfer 40 BTC and the remaining is "locked in" (unless I unlock it). This will prevent hackers emptying out accounts. At least that's the idea.

Pick your anxiety:
*Anxiety scenario 1*: You invest a few thousand in Bitcoin and lose it all. You're bummed out, you learned a lesson and most likely move on with an evolved understanding of risky investing.
*Anxiety scenario 2*: You decide not to invest a few thousand in Bitcoin and over the years it balloons to unforeseen amounts and revolutionizes trading, but you miss out on a share of the wealth.

Not to discredit your evaluation, but just because you have a highly astute technical understanding of the inner workings of the coins, doesn't mean others do. So when you think that you don't get it because of all your logical reasoning, consider that most people don't think about those things at all and simply see it as silver to Bitcoin's gold.
@_date: 2013-12-11 00:48:26
Consider a spade. You use it to dig the earth and find one speck solid gold. Did your spade just "magically produce" gold? No. It took a little bit of effort, time and man power. Now consider that you know there's a shit ton of gold out there under the Pacific ocean. You must invest a huge amount of money, effort and time to go get it. You have to buy machinery, get a team of people together and essentially *invest* into your operation in the hopes that eventually you will get to that hard to find gold and dig it up, and then you better hope that the gold you find is worth more than the money you invested, otherwise what a waste.
So anyway, your computer no more magically produces bitcoin  any more than your spade magically produces gold. It takes a lot of time, expertise, effort, money and risk.
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:44:43

This is common knowledge. It took over a week for my first few transactions to go through. Next time do your research. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 18:29:27
Let's propose that BTC is worth $1000 and LTC $250. I need to spend $100 on a product. I can either choose 0.1 BTC or 0.4 LTC. Doesn't make a difference. The mere presence of LTC means there are "more coins I can use out there" and thus the rarity of BTC diminishes and thus the price. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:04:00
Right now it looks like Litecoin. I bought some and, well, who knows? It just shot up over night ($4 to $9) but hasn't changed much today. But you have to buy BTC first to be able to by LTC.

If household names (Amazon, Ebay, Walmart, Hooters) begin accepting it along side VISA, then - IMO - we can expect bitcoin to be worth a serious amount of money.
If their adoption is slow to non-existent, then it may still be valuable but will remain a fringe, geeky odd thing that strange, geeky odd people know about and use for their odd things.

So, did Coinbase cancel my order because, 1) "my bank account fell through" (like you originally suggested) or 2) because of an influx of orders? (like you are now proposing).
These are two completely different reasons.
If they honor my ticket, I will post back - for the record - and state that they did. Guaranteed.

But shouldn't it be at 25% given there are four times as many?
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:32:05
Totally agree. The sad irony being that if BTC does go through a dramatic crash it will be perceived as unstable and therefore not as attractive to potential retailers.
@_date: 2013-11-20 00:19:36
Absolutely. It's healthy for the market to see and recognize bubbles and have periods of frenetic trading mirrored by relative stability.
@_date: 2013-11-07 18:04:08
Question: What do you mean "*as long as your bank doesn't fall through again*" How did my bank fall through in the first place when Coinbase took the money right away? The thing that fell through was Coinbase *delivering* the BTC after the agreed upon 7 days. Thoughts?
@_date: 2013-12-11 07:31:19
Right now there's not a whole lot of reasons why BTC is better other than "fuck the system" high minded rhetoric. Having my debit card transact straight away on Amazon and other sites is super easy and so is checking out at a store. In fact the problem with Bitcoin is that I have to purchase some before I can use them. Super annoying.  
However, sending money to a friend? Way easier with Bitcoin - assuming you're both already own them. Snowing money to someone in another country? Bitcoin every time. Wanna travel across borders with more than $10k. Bitcoin that shit. 
There are many conveniences. But it's not all rainbows yet. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 06:27:52
I hit cancel and sucked it up. Bummer, cos I "lost" a whole BTC. I basically thought that hitting BUY or SELL meant it just goes through like hitting buy on Amazon, but in fact it puts your offer out onto the exchange and if the price happens to fall in that second you put your offer out there then no one will buy it. Simple as that. I thought it was a glitch, but realize now that thats just the way it worked. Had I known, I'd have hit cancel straight away and re sold then.
@_date: 2013-11-07 19:04:28

The conversation legitimizes Bitcoin in the eyes of many potential investors. Publicity and reporting of the hearings in mainstream news will bring Bitcoin to the eyes of many people. Aside from a surprising "crackdown" or talk of some kind of control it will most likely be good news for BTC.  
@_date: 2013-11-12 07:49:34
What does "everyone" mean? Because if it's within the context of people who own BTC and are holding them, expecting to get rich, it implies we're all wrong. Or does it mean that because we bitcoiners are a minority - compared to the normal population - that we're right?
@_date: 2013-11-18 06:56:53

Its too volatile to be taken seriously. No merchant is going to write the price of a cup o joe on their black board because they'll have to change it every hour. The common rebuttal to this is that it will stabilize over time, but how can this be if the predictions for its future are astronomical? You can't have both. 
@_date: 2013-11-14 21:35:11
Absolutely. Assuming BTC goes where we all want it to go, it's gonna have to change. Nobody (IMO) wants to trade in weird fractions like 0.0000212 BTC. Culturally, we're just not used to it.
My guess is that along with its adoption new words will emerge such as nanoBitcoin. Or maybe we'll just call them all Satoshis?
But you know what else? I have no fucking clue. Maybe it's just fine trading in 0.0002323234 BTC. It comes with the territory. People converted to the metric system without a problem. Italians converted from the hyper-inflated Lira to the Euro.
@_date: 2013-12-31 22:02:35
Not a chance in hell. The rise from 100 to 1000 is *nothing like* a rise from 1000 to 10,000. Bitcoin could potentially see $10K one day if it is fully entrenched part of every day transactions and as secure, regulated and easy to use as VISA. But even that will take a decade. No, 2014 will likely see fluctuations between 700 and 1200 and probably won't top the ATH from 2013.

OK, good news. For me at least. Coinbase reinstated my purchase at the original price and my account is as it should be. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 01:08:58
Haha. A dime is a nickname for ten cents. You know, one *tenth* of a hundred!! The US monitary system was metricised long before the British system, fyi. All I'm saying is it is a little weird to describe money like that but I hope it catches on. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 08:08:30
I make it a point *never* to encourage people to invest because there's a high risk they'll lose their money and ill end up looking like an ass. 
I do however tell them that it's extremely volatile and that I have bought some. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 18:53:05
If Coinbase say when you sign up that "we may cancel the order if you happen to make a short term profit" then fair enough. And sure, I didn't lose and USD (except the minuscule interest on those seven days and the inconvenience). But I *did* lose part of my long term profit because I *lost* the fact that I purchased them at $206 when now I have to repurchase fewer coins for the same price. I have lost part of my long term profit. No question.

I will explain it to you but this is a really basic question which you can easily find the answer to by reading the FAQ and Googling, but it works like this:
A computer program crunches numbers all day and all night long hoping to figure out a very complex mathematical problem. Once it finds the answer, it is "rewarded" with a handful of bitcoins and then the person who ran the program can take those bitcoins and do what he wants with them.
Regarding their value; they are basically worth nothing - just like the paper that money is printed on. It's that *people* determine their value by trading them. The more people who want them, the price goes up. It's funny, people tend to go all existential when they think about bitcoins without realizing that our own currency works in equally strange and fragile ways.
Now go research ;o)

Respectively, this makes no sense in relation to my situation. I did not "buy tactically" or "time the market" or make a "strategic bet" - I bought when BTC was at $206 and it *happened to go up* like we all hope it will. Seven days ago, I did not have a time machine. I am not looking to profit short term, it was just happen-stance and frankly it looks suspicious when Coinbase cancel transfers *when they happen to make money*
I'm keeping an open mind that Coinbase will refund my money and white list me.
@_date: 2013-11-14 04:35:40
How is any of this Coinbase's fault? 
@_date: 2013-11-13 06:39:29
Here is one simple way to do it. And the way I did it.
1. Go to Coinbase, follow the instructions and purchase BTC. Wait for them to arrive in your account (aprox 7 days).
2. Then go to Blockchain, open up a Wallet and transfer ("Send") your BTC from Coinbase to your new Blockchain Wallet.
You'll find easy to follow instructions on both these sites.
I'm sure there are other (better?) ways to do it, I'm sure the community will upvote the best.
@_date: 2013-12-02 05:35:41
Reason is (afaik) those transactions can easily be reversed whereas a wire transfer cannot. Something like that.

A crash isn't necessarily bad news because it means you can now buy BTC for cheap. Many people already in, believe in it. They won't stop believing in it if it crashes down to $100, they'll most likely buy more at that price and watch it grow. The overall trend is up, despite the highs and lows.
@_date: 2013-11-18 05:13:11
Maybe Litecoin mining?
@_date: 2013-11-08 07:02:52
Sure, I guess I'll find out in about a week or so.
@_date: 2013-11-12 07:40:11
Litecoin is $4 today. Odd to think it could be $100 let alone $300. Or $0. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 08:39:32
Haha. This guy. Every similar Bitcoin post his blood pressure goes up a little. By 2040 he'll be shaking alone somewhere muttering "r r r repost"
@_date: 2013-11-26 19:28:44
Last time it hit $900 it fell all the way down to $600. Let's see what happens this time.
@_date: 2013-11-23 07:50:09
It's not volatile to USD, its volatile to.... everything! You think I can sell a beer for 1 BTC? Maybe a year ago I could. It's volatile, period.
@_date: 2013-11-07 18:47:29
Absolutely. Normal people don't use word's like "Guaranteed" and everything this poster writes, screams schill from the phrases to the upbeat bullshit.
@_date: 2013-12-06 17:15:16
Its a market. It goes up. It goes down.
@_date: 2013-11-18 07:05:04
Hold. If it crashes, buy more. Hold. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 19:36:02
I'd love to see a Litecoin chart there. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 22:32:07
It will either be worthless or worthalot.
@_date: 2013-11-26 19:41:36
Very stable. Until today. I hate to say it but if I had to guess, I'd predict a big fall at $1000. Not sure whether to join it or not.
@_date: 2013-12-11 20:29:10
The case against using the phrase would be if you don't think it has a future, not because it is being used today. It isn't, aside from a tiny minority.
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:12:19
Maybe he's a James Bond like evil mastermind and he'll resurface on the day it hits $1000 with a kill switch. All gone.
@_date: 2013-11-29 02:40:56
"During the bubble, the frenzy was wild. People were even betting on one Bitcoin being worth - yes - $100,000"
@_date: 2013-12-01 06:55:37
$1000 minimum, doubtful that low. Next week will be a big week.
@_date: 2013-11-13 04:00:26
Ah the old flip job. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 02:00:03
What about Bitcoin Black Friday? Could rise because of all the movement, could plummet because of merchant's desire to see $$$ (could do nothing because China).
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:50:49
I can't get any work done.
@_date: 2013-11-17 21:24:58
Jesus. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 09:43:36
@_date: 2013-11-18 00:39:53
You can't easily get $$$ out of Mt. Gox is why.
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:43:55
I read somewhere - I don't have a link handy - that if Bitcoin reaches the ubiquity of VISA (i.e. the same amount of money flowing through the system per day) then one BTC should be worth about $100,000. So a lot of time yet. The most important thing for Bitcoin is the rate of adoption of retailers who accept BTC as a form of payment. It needs to rise so that we can spend. Once your local coffee shop and super markets are accepting it, it will probably mean its value is quite high. If that ever happens.

At the start of your talk, give everyone (including the teacher) an envelope without saying what it is. Half way through, have them open their envelopes. It's Bitcoin. Whatever you can afford. So , print out like 25 paper wallets with 0.00125 BTC inside.
This alone will be a better lesson than anything you say. Good luck!
@_date: 2013-11-14 05:05:09
You didn't put that in your post. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 00:55:56
I'm not talking about mixing imperial and metric. I'm talking about your average chav buying knickers in marks n sparks going "nought point nought nought nought nought one two? Whossat in normal money?" And then there's millibit and microbit and uberbit and satishi and what not. It's just too complex for everyday non-geek people. We need very simple monitory units and right now Bitcoin doesn't provide this (yet). A buck, a quid, five pee, a tenner, ten cents, a fiver for a pint, five bucks for gallon of gas. Real easy right? Mono syllabic, no thought needed. With BTC's volitility, as soon as we get used to the uBTC, we're gonna have to start thinking about something new!!  
@_date: 2013-12-10 23:37:55
What's your phrase?
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:49:17
To the potato.
@_date: 2013-12-04 03:29:55
Actually, not to be a bore but us yanks metricised our money waaaaay before you did. So, welcome to the party Mr. 1971. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 22:46:35
How about use gold? 
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:10:32
Aaand, it totally happened ;o)
@_date: 2013-11-26 20:59:39
That's not cool. You know what's cool?
$1 Billion Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-15 18:32:53
I must admit, I'd be terrified of making a transfer that large (hell, even half a million USD). 
@_date: 2013-12-01 07:53:50
That'd make a lot of new millionaires.
@_date: 2013-11-30 00:51:03
Yeah, it's there under "Your current active orders" - does this mean I should basically hit Cancel? I sold when LTC was at $49 (it's highest price).
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:03:22
For one bit coin, I'll live type it for ya
@_date: 2013-11-28 21:04:43
Currency *is* bubble?

Good for them, glad someone's taking the lead. Hopefully it'll start a trend!
@_date: 2013-11-08 20:10:24
Maybe he knows something we don't? 
@_date: 2013-12-10 07:26:39
Downvoted for offering a reasonable, fair assessment of the situation. I want irrational anger!
@_date: 2013-11-07 17:31:06
I bought BTC seven days ago at $206, and it hasn't yet posted. I hope I don't get that letter too. I'll be pissed too. Sucks.
EDIT: Wow. I just checked my email and sure enough, they fucking cancelled it. 
This is insane!
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:48:39
The common advice at $10, $100, $400, $750 or $1000 is the same. Don't invest more than you can afford to lose. No matter what the price, make no mistake that investing in Bitcoin is *high risk.* So do your research, understand what it is and invest a little if you can.
