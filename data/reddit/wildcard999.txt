Yes I did read your post and you still didn't answer the question. Of course you don't really have to answer the question and I am not trying to be a dick but I don't understand the entire process like I am sure you do. The reason for the misconception of bitcoin or any cryptocurrency is no one really understands the process in how it works. I was told a while back that I had to use a company like coinbase to store my bitcoin. I then later found out about hardware wallets. My question was how to protect my bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency. Now since I don't have a hardware wallet and never used one like I am sure you have, once I transfer my bitcoin over to the wallet and cancel my coinbase account, how do I buy bitcoin if I am not using a place like coinbase. Yes, before you rip me a new ass I see your webpage with a crap ton of exchange links. Which ones are trusted? Am I just going to go to any website and drop my credit card to buy bitcoin? The reason I went with coinbase to begin with is people I know had successful transactions on coinbase. If this is to be looked at like a bank then I still don't know a place I can trust to buy bitcoin unless I continue to buy it through coinbase and then move it to the wallet. Now maybe I am missing how all this works but if cryptocurrency is going to be something that people want to use then they should have a better way of explaining how to keep your money secure. Once again I don't know hardly anything about cryptocurrency and don't claim to just asking a question.

Yikes. I was looking at an antminer that only did 450ghs and figured that would be good enough. Tahnks for the information.

Thank you for the information but the one thing I don't understand is without a company like coinbase, how the hell do I buy bitcoin or litecoin etc and move it into my hardware wallet?
