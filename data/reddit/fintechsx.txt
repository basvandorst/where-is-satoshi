I hate the people that go around tipping the absolute minimum. I've had people tip me 5 satoshis. For those who are involved with Bitcoin, it can be comical, but for newbies its a pain in the ass.

My biggest issue with coinmap is that its really outdated. Quite often when I try to go to a bitcoin accepting business, I learn that they know longer accept Bitcoin when I get to the counter. 
Too many of these businesses end up with so few bitcoin clients that they eventually lose interest.

I don't foresee them making it easy to buy Bitcoin with your Paypal account. One of Paypal's key features is that you can send a payment to anyone without doing any due diligence while being confident that you can reverse it at any time without recourse. With Bitcoin, caveat emptor applies.

Finally it seems that people are realizing that Bitcoin mining isn't the magical cash cow that they previously thought it to be.

I like green address due to 2-fa support, HD addresses, and multisig.

I think we all have to admit that 2014 has been a crappy year for the price of Bitcoin. At the start of the year, everyone was thinking that the price was going "to the moon" however now that we're settling at around $300, the dream of "moon" seems further than ever.
Does it mean that it won't happen? Of course not. But rather than constantly argue about whether or not Bitcoin is a good investment, why not focus on the other positive aspects of it other than price?

Just because you claim not to be doesn't mean that its true. Paypal claims that they don't arbitrarily freeze random user accounts without valid reason, but we know that's a lie. And the US government claims that they don't kill people unconstitutionally but that happens on a near daily basis.

The part about this that I find impressive isn't the minimal fee, but rather that a transfer of this size has absolutely no government oversight, and can be done without asking permission.
If this were done through a traditional bank, it would most likely be free, or at minimal cost. The banks like their wealthy clients, and are willing to treat them well. However, if you were to do a transfer of this size, it would likely involve a ridiculous amount of scrutiny, government reporting, government oversight, and a whole bunch of questions if things didn't add up correctly come tax time. Bitcoin frees the people from governments that have overstepped their boundaries.

Glad to see everything up and running as per usual. I was a little concerned the other day when I noticed that a whole bunch of exchanges were missing from the list. 
Love looking at Bitcoin Average to get a better sense of the global price without dealing with charts and other complications.

They aren't, and that's not their focus at this point. They're trying to grab as much market share as possible, so that if Bitcoin becomes as huge as some people think that it will become, they'll end up being the leader of the pack in a multi-trillion dollar industry.

Wall St is one of the main reasons that we need Bitcoin in the first place. I think many Bitcoiners would be happy if we could keep Wall street away!

The best protection that Cryptocurrencies could receive would be a complete absence of bills or legislation surrounding them.

Removing wallets due to not forcing users to be secure is ridiculous. Should we avoid telling people about paper wallets because they might print it out on a shared printer?

Why bring Brock Pierce into this?

I don't know why people think that this means anything. I could single handedly increase the number of transactions to the highest levels of all time if I wanted to burn enough money on fees.

A criminal.

Paypal is the poster child for horrible payment companies. If they were a bank, those in charge would be arrested for fraud. Stolen funds likely makes up a large chunk of their annual profits.

It will be interesting to see if people actually do end up boycotting this as a result. I understand why the organizers of the conference claim that they shouldn't be required to judge whether or not something is legitimate or not, especially if they are paying advertisers, in the same way that Google doesn't verify each and every one of their ads for legitimacy.
With that said, its pretty much guaranteed that GAW is a scam at this point. I'm pretty sure its illegal to promote something like this that is a known. Perhaps someone can do a citizens arrest. ;p

I don't think they were intentionally lying when they said this. Also, last I checked, it isn't Jan 10th yet.

Ben Lawsky puts on a good show, however once the actual draft is released (right before Christmas and New Years, great timing), I'm sure we'll find all sorts of sneaky little laws in place that are there simply to tax and undermine the average American.
Changing the record keeping requirements will likely just shift the record keeping from one entity to another. Cryptocurrency was designed to be unregulated and we will likely end up seeing this play out in the long run. The government will attempt to impose these laws on the public that doesn't want them, and eventually they'll be ignored, just like laws on torrenting.
