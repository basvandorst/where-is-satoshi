Yeah, but it's a loss of an percentage greater than 5%. It would've been clearer had they used &gt;5%   
A loss of -5% would've been a gain, so it's correct.

Doesn't mean politicians won't use faulty evidence. Because that never happens am I right?

Buy some more, tonight will be an exciting night.

Over 5% = 5%+

So you guys suggest buying after the auction and its crash?
@_date: 2015-11-02 23:59:37
I myself sold at 340 and now I'm waiting for the bubble to pop and I'll buy again when it's &lt;$300
@_date: 2015-11-02 23:35:27
I hope option 1 so I can start buying more coins when it's &lt;300 again

At this rate I might invest my student loans into Bitcoins (not sure if /s)
@_date: 2015-11-03 02:28:49
So why not ignore the auction if you have to buy above market price? Is it so it's from a reliable ^^^^^hue source? To get a large haul at once?
@_date: 2015-11-04 21:15:29
Good job guys, crashing the price just before the auction so it won't be as much.
@_date: 2015-11-03 00:17:45
No, but I have a gut feeling it will and this bubble won't grow that large.

I have 0.58 Bitcoin. I started last week :)
Why? Because I saw it was climbing fast and I wanted to start investing my disposable income. ^^^^^go ^^^^^china

I've only very recently started using Bitcoin and I don't get this graph. Is someone able to explain where I should look, because it seems pretty clustered to me. Thanks :)
