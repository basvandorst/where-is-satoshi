No. Your market cap is zero. If you sold one of them for $10,000, thus creating a “sold for” price, then the market cap is $100k. The difference is the last price paid for the item.

IMO, I think they’ll hold the bitcoin. This is a way for the state to acquire bitcoin without directly using tax payers money for it. They are probably hedging their bets and hoping it will increase in value from here. But that’s all speculation on my part, and I’m wrong 87% of the time.
