What kind of alts did you buy?
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:41:14
Maybe try switching your BTC for Litecoin and then transfer to Binance.
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:32:07
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:47:04
I predict nothing will happen.

You may have trouble confirming your identity on GDAX because of your age, but GL.

If each pizza is $190.

1. You'll get wrecked by Coinbase's fees.
2. You are not going to see big gains on $10.

If u have Litecoin I'll do a trade.
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:45:34
OP thinks Bitcoin transfers are reversible. Kek
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:06:27
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:25:23
I really wish it would go back down to $5600 so I could buy real quick.
@_date: 2017-11-01 15:14:21
Which altcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:02:50
I bought at $7400 and $6800 thinking that we would go back up.  Oh well, long term gains boiii
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:04:46
Not gunna lie, Litecoin is looking pretty juicy.  Maybe if it dips down to $50 then I'll buy.
@_date: 2017-11-07 06:23:42
@_date: 2017-11-01 12:50:41
If it drops to mid $5000s I'm buying.  I've been waiting for a huge dip for a while now and it keeps going up.
@_date: 2017-11-02 03:20:45
I just made a small transaction to Exodus &gt;$30 and I had a 10% fee.

Get USD through Coinbase and buy on GDAX to avoid some fees.
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:03:26
Why would you buy Bcash when it's falling?
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:01:34
Ultimately I would try to transfer USD to Coinbase and purchase Bitcoin on GDAX to avoid some fees.  However, some people aren't able to verify their identity on GDAX.  If that's the case, then purchase on Coinbase and transfer either to a paper wallet or a desktop/mobile wallet.  Some would suggest getting a hardware wallet, but with $100 of bitcoin, that wouldn't be necessary.
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:06:32
If this is the price you want to "buy the dip at" GL buddy.
@_date: 2017-11-01 15:27:01
What's your setup in terms of Pc specs?
@_date: 2017-11-06 04:40:23
Definitely will be buying more if we hit 6.5k.
@_date: 2017-11-03 03:45:56
(Future Price / Price you bought BTC for) * (Amount of $ spent on BTC)
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:23:06
Congrats, better late than never!
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:29:55
You don't lose money until you sell.
@_date: 2017-11-14 03:36:54
Transfer to GDAX for free, then send BTC to wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-01 00:22:31
I doubt it, probably not profitable with the setup he's going to have.
@_date: 2017-11-01 17:48:16
Lucky haha, for me it's far more profitable buying BTC and hodling than mining any coin in general.
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:47:16
Worth about 656 keys today.
@_date: 2017-11-08 06:04:33
This is exactly what I do.  If you buy one cent higher than $51.99 you get another $1 fee.
@_date: 2017-11-01 16:22:19
That's pretty cool, and how is your electricity cheap?
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:20:23
Nah he means HODL
@_date: 2017-11-01 16:24:07
There's no way you kept all coins tho.
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:55:15
Good for beginners, but you'll also be paying more in fees.  It's also not an ideal way to store coins long term.
@_date: 2017-10-13 20:56:54
Buy on Coinbase and transfer to paper wallet.
@_date: 2017-09-13 22:22:12
Which platform did you decide to buy on?
@_date: 2017-10-19 17:15:55
Don't you think he should transfer to a paper wallet at least before the hard fork?
@_date: 2017-09-30 18:18:10
Doesn't Coinbase have insurance if it's hacked?
