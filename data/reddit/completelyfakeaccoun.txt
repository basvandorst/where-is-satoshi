Coinbase fees, when added to bitcoin transaction fees, do not compare favorably to aggregated credit card fees for large businesses.
Plus for the b2b trades you mention to be done in bitcoin, there would have to be institutions willing to supply credit in bitcoin, a losing proposition with a deflationary currency.
Unless everyone went to cash up front, but that would require a severe revision of most business models, and would considerably slow down business growth and flexibility.

The US government regulates business being conducted in foreign currency if that business involves US stakeholders.
Your local community college probably offers an introduction to business class, I highly recommend it.

Well it makes it harder for incompetent idiots and scam artists to run an exchange, and it allows the state to protect its citizen.
The market will be safer, more stable, more resilient and more accountable. Do you not agree that this will help drive bitcoin adoption?

Well you need computers hashing all over the place, instead of just some sort of server with the judgement sitting on a hard drive somewhere, along with the thousand of pages of material a court system generates every day.
The court's seal on the documents provides proof of its integrity; it's a system that has worked well, and cost efficiently (compared to having a whole distributed network of computer doing busy work over and over just to prove a point) for hundreds of years.
You're just trying to find a use case for the block chain for the sake of using the block chain.

When you say 
A $5 donation nets us $4.55, $5 worth of bitcoin nets us $5. That makes a big difference when you're relying on mostly small donors.
Did you take into account the exchange fees to convert it back to fiat, as you will likely be required to do for accounting purposes or to spend it on program funds? What about outgoing transaction fees if you find a supplier that will accept bitcoin?
As a donor, bitcoin is less advantageous for me as I cannot write off the transaction fee on my taxes.

buttcoin.org, while satirical, has the most in-depth analysis of bitcoin from technical, social and economic standpoint. The authors are also relatively neutral third parties, so you get an unbiased standpoint.

If the sender sends the transaction without a fee, it will get processed by the miners after all the fee-included transaction have been processed. In practice, this could take days. (Bitcoin isn't instant either, I don't know where that came from; it takes 10 minutes at least to get a single confirmation if your transaction is included in the first block processed).
For tax purposes, I assume you'll emit a receipt for the amount you've received, in which case I can't write-off the transaction fee. 
Basically, you're passing on the payment processing fee unto the donor.

I'm not a regulator, and as such was under the impression that your initial recommendation to fuck off was not directly addressed to me.
The regulation does not capture transactions between parties outside of the state's jurisdiction, it cannot, as it is being enacted by the state. This is a fundamental principle of law, and I simply assumed you would know this; my apologies.

Where does BitPay get their USD anyway? How is their business model sustainable?
@_date: 2014-07-17 19:56:29
Regulations can't be applied retroactively, that's an essential element of a fair justice system.
@_date: 2014-07-18 17:13:38
So just to be clear, Coinbase accepts bitcoin then sends Dell the money, right?

41 donors means the Bitcoin community is slightly larger than your average high school class.

Rightfully so, especially when you're handling your customer's financial future. Good on you for being a conscientious actor in the business paradigm.

Why are they denominating their fee in fiat, though?
@_date: 2014-03-05 18:33:16
So there's no regulations except natural rights but there's a judicial system?
There's absolutely no internal consistency in your ideology.

The buyer has to pay the transaction fee, and the merchant will have to pay fee eventually if they want to use the bitcoins, and exchange fee if they want to convert to hard currency.
People state that bitcoin has no fee; this is a lie.
@_date: 2014-07-17 14:53:12
Why? What purpose would that serve?
@_date: 2014-02-18 18:02:45
3) Mt Gox shuts down, keeps the money and the coins, you lose everything;
4) Mt Gox opens up transactions again, price of bitcoin crashes for completely unrelated reasons, you lose everything;
5) To the moon, I guess?
@_date: 2014-03-05 17:47:03
At that point, you're using a credit card system on top of bitcoin. Considering that most people get paid in dollar, convert it to bitcoin, spend it with a merchant who will in all likelihood convert to dollars to pay suppliers...
Why bother with bitcoin?

If they're breaking the law, e.g. by sending bitcoin to NY residents without following protocol, they are not innocent. No one is supposed to be unaware of law and all that.
@_date: 2014-07-17 19:49:50
You're assuming that the general public opposes - or indeed, cares about - the regulation of bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-07-17 18:01:13
If a foreign entity breaks the law in New York State, New York will absolutely try to go after them. If a business wants to operate in a jurisdiction, it is, indeed, their duty to know and comply with the laws and regulations of that jurisdiction.
Welcome to the business world, I'd suggest starting with an intro class at your local community college.

How can anything be enforced without regulations?

Ah yes, let's get the taxpayers to pay to make the system secure, not the user of the system.
Also blah blah blah centralization.

How /dare/ NYS expect bitcoin business be operated like grown-up businesses?

Cash is also regulated, however.

This implies that natural rights are enforced. How are they enforced without a regulatory framework?

If there are no rules beyond "natural rights", who makes sure those rights are enforced? Who decides when they are broken? How are they enforced?
Whoever can exert the most violence upon the people whom they've decided have broken their "natural rights"?

I simply fail to see what benefit having the documents on the blockchain provides that a traditional document management system doesn't.
@_date: 2014-07-17 18:24:03
USA &gt; Bitcoin; I think you're betting on the wrong horse here.
@_date: 2014-07-17 18:26:39
So you're proposing that the process:
1. Make judgement;
2. Digitize record;
3. Store record in document management system;
Be expanded to include:
4. Hash document;
5. Promulgate to blockchain;
6. Have it sit there too;
7. Pay for the privilege.
I fail to see how that's a beneficial idea. "Job creation" for the sake of make-work is not beneficial to society.

Buying and selling goods and services is, basically, the definition of business.

In this use case, how would your proposal be better than the current system of centralized and recognized public records? A bitcoin-style block chain is extremely resource intensive for what it actually does, after all.
@_date: 2014-03-05 17:57:58
If there's no regulation establishing an enforcement framework, how can natural rights - or any rights, really - be enforced?

That has nothing to do with the value of the dollar; the car is worth more now because the prices offered for those cars has gone up.

You've got it backward, you'd still have $55, except that $55 would no longer buy you that video game (Assuming the price of video games hadn't actually gone done, like it did in real life.)
That's the whole point of inflation - Your money depreciates over time.
