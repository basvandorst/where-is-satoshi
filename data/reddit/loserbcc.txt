Did mycelium just tank after their ICO that they did?  Any news on that? Are the tokens even worth anything today?

Question.... How would one audit the process ?  One could just say they lost a lot of weight "lie" ... If you were going to do one for btc....how do you make it "provable"?

No worries yet ;)

When I get home -- I'll be glad to do so -- but one question -- I did a look up on a coin I had with me today -- and it has 0 transactions/no btc loaded as of yet -- is there a delay for him to load these?
