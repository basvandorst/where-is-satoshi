But the news make risk fearer investors to opt out, so they sell. Plus buyers say "something's wrong, I won't pay a coin full price".
Happens after every single bad news in the ecosystem.

A whole European Economy crashed and Bitcoin hasn't gone up, it even went down. I'm getting convinced that Bitcoin is lacking traction.

I come from Argentina. Every time a devaluation comes, people go for Dollars or Euros as they want to reduce risk ASAP, so in the short term nobody will look for BTC nor any volatile asset.

I'm definitely a newbie cryptography, Can someone explain how is that the string that Craig gave can be decoded as "Wright, it is not the same as if I sign Craig Wright, Satoshi.

" [1] *AND* it can also be founded in the signature of the genesis block (after converting back from hex)?
[1] python script:
import base64
pritnt(base64.b64decode("IFdyaWdodCwgaXQgaXMgbm90IHRoZSBzYW1lIGFzIGlmIEkgc2lnbiBDcmFpZyBXcmlnaHQsIFNh dG9zaGkuCgo= "))
b' Wright, it is not the same as if I sign Craig Wright, Satoshi.
