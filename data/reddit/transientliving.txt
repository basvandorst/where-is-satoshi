Here are some of the older ones from when I was following the controversy closely. I'm sure there have been more recently, but to be fair I haven't really been reading a whole lot lately. Suffice to say, Coinbase has proven itself to be one of the less trustworthy companies. You'd have to be a fool, or at least misinformed to keep your money with them. They are shaping up to be the PayPal of the BTC world - this is not a compliment.
   
@_date: 2014-02-10 06:29:02
Certainly, but there are two important things to consider:
1) In the event of an attack, what is the company's typical response? I can't speak for the other exchanges but we have seen that, for CB, it appears to be Olaf bumbling into and mumbling "sorry about your luck."
2) Are attacks the only thing you should be worried about? Coinbase has a tendency to fumble around, lose your BTC, forget transactions happened, etc. Hell, I had them randomly drop almost ten thousand dollars worth of BTC into my account at one point (before you ask, no, I did not keep it.). These people don't have any idea what they're doing.
@_date: 2014-02-08 03:18:25
This is... actually really cool. I've been considering investing in gold bullion for a long time. I will do some research on these guys.
Do you have personal experience with this company? Some of the less reputable online precious metal sellers have been known to do some pretty sketchy things (like send zinc bricks with a thin coating of gold), so I want to be careful.
@_date: 2014-02-08 20:35:55
That's cute, but no one is paying me, nor am I a "shill". Thanks for trying though.
@_date: 2014-02-08 16:02:03
You are absolutely wrong. It is not fraud.
According to the OP, he did not initiate the transfer.
A chargeback can be legally initiated in a number of cases, including when you did not give permission for the transaction in question.
I'd encourage you to read up on chargebacks, my friend. This is a powerful tool in our arsenal in order to keep these companies honest and less able to abscond with our fiat.
@_date: 2014-02-10 18:08:28
Stupid and ignorant people will always look to a strong centralized news source to tell them what to think. It's unfortunately the way things go in a society which is this interconnected.
However I will say that trusting a statement like this from companies like Coinbase or even BitStamp is especially foolish. They have a vested financial interest in MtGox failing.
@_date: 2014-02-08 02:35:03
I see. I really appreciate the advice - thank you. I will look into other exchanges.
@_date: 2014-02-02 05:45:46
Will do. The issue has been identified as something along the lines of  'we canned you as a merchant because we've received negative emails from customers about your business.' 
Unfortunately, it is looking like their standard operating procedure for canning a merchant that they don't like is to freeze their entire account without even giving any sort of notice. This is actually somehow even worse than PayPal's procedure, which is, well, pretty stunning.
@_date: 2014-02-10 17:57:44
Are you serious? Coinbase isn't a reputable source, if they issued any sort of statement like this I'd be more inclined to believe the opposite of what they say.
@_date: 2014-02-10 19:36:19
Initial research suggests you need a $7,000,000 surety bond if you are getting licensed in all 50 states. Assuming the states require the same (or similar) amount each, that means a single state would only require a $140,000 surety bond. This would not be a problem.
Is getting the MSB still difficult if you have the bond?
@_date: 2014-02-08 16:33:17
You've been doing nothing but rabidly defending Coinbase this entire thread, despite the fact that they are plainly in the wrong here.
We should all avoid doing business with them in the future, as our coins are quite simply not safe in their hands.
Coinbase is NOT good for Bitcoin. Their practices are unprofessional and dangerous.
@_date: 2014-02-08 02:51:19
Well, I'd rather wait months than literally never have my BTC turned back into fiat. But I will definitely take this under advisement and look into the other exchanges over Mt. Gox. Thanks for the info.
@_date: 2014-02-10 21:34:36
Does Robocoin allow you to get around MSB requirements? Is it really as simple as buying a Robocoin machine, installing it, and rolling out from there?
@_date: 2014-02-11 19:26:06
No, sorry, you cannot silence me with that kind of gradeschool argument, but nice try.
This is a forum for the discussion of bitcoin. I am discussing bitcoin and pointing people towards safer solutions, so they are less likely to get defrauded and lose their money. If you'd prefer not to have these sorts of discussions, perhaps this isn't the place for you.
I will continue to do my best to spread the word that Coinbase is not to be trusted, because I don't want them to screw over anyone else.
Just because you got lucky and supposedly had a good experience with their customer service, doesn't mean that this is the rule for everyone. 
@_date: 2014-06-07 20:23:35
I disagree that companies like this "have" to be overzealous. And even if I agreed, there are different ways of treating your customers when a situation like that arises. Coinbase has a track record of freezing customer funds in these sorts of situations, without even letting the customer know they're frozen. It's very troublesome to see such a powerhouse BTC player have more draconian, anti-customer policies than even Paypal.
I can only imagine they rushed into CB, yeah. That's the only reason I can think of anyone using them - Mangatrader clearly didn't do their homework.
@_date: 2014-02-08 15:58:30
No, but I could recommend you spend more time outside and less time trolling and spouting nonsense on the internet.
@_date: 2014-06-07 02:43:48
Agreed. Coinbase should not be allowed to advertise here. They've actually proven themselves to be a disreputable company anyway, so it's twice as bad.
@_date: 2014-02-10 06:34:33
The fact is, the customer has the power here, as well he should. To me, it appears that Coinbase has defrauding this man.
If he hasn't already, brainseating should be requesting his back perform a chargeback on that card transaction at his earliest convenience.
@_date: 2014-02-08 21:50:47
There were no "rules or regulations" broken with regards to my business. You're making some pretty wild accusations and assumptions here.
Sure, I'm relatively new to Bitcoin. That doesn't mean I deserve to be defrauded or otherwise taken advantage of.
I don't know if you actually read my posts, because I did in fact state that I already moved my coin out of Coinbase and into my private wallet.
Your insults are unwarranted and immature. I am simply a customer who experienced Coinbase's miserably incompetent and hostile customer service. If you think I am a bad businessman because I am making the public aware of the dangers of transacting with Coinbase, you and I are simply going to have a fundamental difference of opinion.
@_date: 2014-02-10 21:04:25
Fully agree with this. He/she/it spent a great deal of time shitting up my thread about my negative interaction (available at  ) with Coinbase and basically looking like a paid shill.
@_date: 2014-06-07 20:19:39
I don't know about that. I think he's just sort of a dumb guy who works for a sketchy company.
@_date: 2014-02-02 06:10:44
I had two Coinbase accounts, mainly for my own convenience because I wanted different bank accounts hooked up to two different CB accounts. It was also convenient for me to test out my merchant stuff with two separate accounts, to make sure I had integrated their PHP API properly with my site, etc.
Why would they temporarily block me from moving coins between my two Coinbase accounts, but not out of the system entirely? That doesn't make sense to me.
In any event, it seems very sketchy that all of these things happened behind the scenes with no input from, or notice to me.
@_date: 2014-06-06 03:02:46
Because Coinbase is a terrible company that's bad for Bitcoin, and lots of people on don't want them advertising here.
@_date: 2014-06-11 18:58:01
Ehh, I'm not so sure. I run a few businesses and if one of them was a dildo shop I probably wouldn't want it to be publicly associated with the others for a wide variety of reasons. It seems like a stretch to immediately call him out as a scammer for this.
@_date: 2014-06-11 06:57:33
Of course, in this situation you could at least immediately initiate an ACH chargeback against Coinbase.
@_date: 2014-02-08 04:35:18
So, hold on a minute here. Are you saying that I shouldn't have "bitched" despite the fact that the third party acted on the complaint in a borderline insane and unprofessional manner?
I am attempting to save potential Coinbase customers from this sort of thing happening to them. If you're taking issue with the fact that I'm making my grievance public, well, I don't know what to tell you - we are going to have a difference of opinion there. Transparency is HUGELY important in order to keep companies honest. It kind of shocks me that a supporter of BTC would think otherwise.
Believe me, I am not going to use Coinbase any longer. They have permanently lost me as a customer. I may sneak my coins out through them with third parties if I cannot get an exchange to do it, but that will be an absolute last resort.
The fact that Coinbase doesn't really have a major competitor is probably the only reason they can get away with this sort of behavior. It is a monopoly, in some ways.
@_date: 2014-02-08 02:20:05
BitStamp is the exchange that Coinbase uses, is it not? Why is MtGox considered to be a bad idea? BTC seems to be valued higher at that exchange.
Sorry, I am still new to this - thank you for your patience, I appreciate any information you can give me.
@_date: 2014-02-08 07:15:19
The man was defrauded and Coinbase is telling him to go pound sand rather than help resolve the problem. Personally, I am very glad that he has brought this to the public light, and I hope he resolves it with the help of his bank.
This should scare people away from Coinbase, not Bitcoin. I've read - and now experienced - far too many instances of their willful incompetence and negligence as a company.
@_date: 2014-02-09 01:47:07
We can disagree about how much I did or did not understand the details of Bitcoin, etc. Even if you assume I went in fully ignorant, I must repeat, this is not an excuse or a reason why I would deserve to be defrauded or otherwise taken advantage of by Coinbase.
Also: "losing control twice"? What do you mean by that?
"Kept causing my own problems" - I have no idea what you are talking about with this. You claim to have read my posts but I am dubious on this point, as your own post is reading like it was written by a Coinbase employee rabidly defending this company without much regard to what I'm saying.
You know, you can keep calling me a "petulant child" but at the end of the day I think most people would be upset at having over $16000 worth of assets frozen without any sort of notification, then given the runaround about the whys and wherefores of what happened. I also think that any responsible adult would bring this to the attention of the community, so that people can be warned away from the sorts of predatory and incompetent practices that Coinbase is using..
Seriously, take a step back, take a deep breath, and consider what you're saying before you start flinging pointless insults at me. I am trying to help people safeguard their money, end of story.
@_date: 2014-02-10 02:47:35
Well, I can't speak directly for anyone else, but I am a merchant and I got screwed by Coinbase. Plus, you don't know if he's going to end up holding some BTC in his wallet at some point.
Point newbies towards trusted solutions like private wallets and the exchanges. Coinbase might be easier and "convenient" but it's far more dangerous.
If a newbie gets screwed over by CB, they might get turned off to BTC forever, you know?
@_date: 2014-02-08 20:37:00
I own my own businesses. I don't "work for" anyone.
Also, if you're going to make wild and crazy accusations, you want them to at least make a little logical sense. Why would BitStamp want to get rid of Coinbase when Coinbase is in bed with them? Goofy.
@_date: 2014-05-24 14:52:35
Actually a lot of people have had issues with Coinbase, they just have a lot of employees trolling to downvote anybody who brings it up.
@_date: 2014-02-10 01:39:20
You're throwing out words like "guaranteed" pretty easily. Literally nothing is guaranteed about it. Speaking from experience, if Coinbase feels like freezing your funds for a whimsical reason, they will immediately do so and there's no "guarantee" whatsoever that you'll ever see them again.
I don't know a lot about Bitpay so maybe that is a good alternative, but I can tell you that any merchant working with Coinbase is asking for trouble down the line.
@_date: 2014-02-10 01:21:42
So how many "isolated incidents" does it take for us to understand that blindly trusting Coinbase with your coins is a fool's move?
Here are a few incidents off the top of my head, including my own story:
These people have terrible customer support and unprofessional business practices. Olaf from Coinbase actually came into one of the "account hacked" threads and basically said "your account was hacked because our security is really bad - but thanks for the money, sucker."
@_date: 2014-02-08 20:03:56
This does not work for everyone. If they think they can scam you out of enough money, you get told to go pound sand.
@_date: 2014-02-08 19:37:51
If they are able to offer a more stable, more trustworthy model with better customer service, the markup might actually be worth it.
Coinbase's reputation is going down, for the record. They've been at the center of a lot of controversies lately. Speaking as someone who got screwed over by them, I can tell you that not everyone is satisfied with them.
@_date: 2014-02-02 02:54:36
Thanks to everyone who has commented. To Coinbase's credit, I actually did receive a reply back today, a few hours after I posted this thread. However, their response has left me nonplussed. Apparently, they received some complaints about a business that I was using their merchant services for, so they made an executive decision to quietly cripple my account with no notice to me.
In the email, they said: "your bitcoin funds are not on hold and can be transferred out of your wallet as you see fit." I was able to send a bitcoin to a friend, so this much is true now - although I was unable to send any coins earlier today. 
This is actually really ironic because I got into Bitcoin for two reasons, and two reasons only:
1) To speculate.
2) To use it for merchant services, in order to get away from draconian and merchant-unfriendly processors like PayPal.
What I truly don't understand is why they took away my ability to buy and sell BTC. There was maybe 0.3 BTC in there that came from my merchant activities. Literally everything else was from my own bank accounts. The extra horrifying thing, however, is that I had to find this out by attempting to sell BTC (and being denied), rather than getting some sort of notice. What if BTC had started crashing, and I wanted to get out in a hurry? What an even nastier surprise that would have been.
At this point, I don't know what to do with my BTC. I sort of just want to turn them back into USD and forget this all happened. In any event, it looks like that I can at least send my BTC to other wallets now, so I'd be thankful any and all advice on what to do at this point. Is there anything else as straightforward and simple as Coinbase to turn BTC into USD? 
Thanks again to everyone who has replied, I really appreciate it!
@_date: 2014-02-10 19:19:29
But Coin Cafe doesn't allow you to sell BTC, does it?
@_date: 2014-02-11 23:43:10
Coinbase shills don't want to hear me warning people away from them, perhaps.
Good luck trying to silence me though, let me know how that works out for you!
@_date: 2014-02-08 05:16:55
Thank you for the advice. I will sign up and look around.
@_date: 2014-02-08 02:31:16
I will start the verification process with Bitfinex and Bitstamp.
If I really wanted to, I could just send the BTC to some friends' CB accounts and have them cash out for me, but I really don't want to give them my business after they treated me this way, nor do I really trust any of my money in their hands at this point.
Thank you for the advice. I'm glad your experience was better than mine.
@_date: 2014-02-10 07:58:45
They appear to have a more vested interest in customer service, as they are the ones facilitating the actual trading of cryptocurrencies. Also, they provide a better exchange rate.
All Coinbase does is buy coins from BitStamp and then sell them to you at marked up, predatory rates. The least they could do is treat their customers decently, but they have failed in that regard. We should be pointing newbies in the direction of something better.
@_date: 2014-02-10 21:43:53
Oops, I had you confused with someone else. Though I am pretty sure you are an alternate account for - the guy who I thought was you - so it's whatever.
In any event, you're just a troll, dude. You, in your infinite class, who replied to me in this thread:
with "Shut up faggot", then edited to say something like "Sweet dreams, pumpkin", then deleted it, thinking no one would see.
And for the record, no, I am not jordan, though I do commiserate with him insofar as we both got screwed by Coinbase (although it appears he got screwed harder than me - at least I got my BTC out.)
@_date: 2014-02-10 06:38:32
This appears to be a straight up falsehood, as it still took several days for me. Also, too bad they're incompetent. You apparently didn't train them well enough, as one of them sent me sarcastic unprofessional copy when I was trying to get a serious issue resolved.
This company is a joke.
@_date: 2014-02-08 19:38:38
False, more people than ever are coming out about having been scammed by Coinbase.
@_date: 2014-02-02 04:12:52
I will look into these, thank you!
@_date: 2014-02-08 07:25:27
Yeah, it's a smart call to stay far away from Coinbase.
@_date: 2014-02-10 03:33:53
Well, if it's true that they actually added some security layers in response to the problem, that's nice I guess - but they still dropped the ball on security in the first place, and their response to the customers that got screwed was a glorified "go pound sand."
This landlord guy is not gonna be happy if he loses several thousand dollars in BTC due to Coinbase's incompetence and subsequently gets told to go pound sand.
@_date: 2014-02-10 04:34:47
Like I said, how many "isolated incidents" does it take? Just because I posted a smattering of links doesn't mean that these are the only things that happened.
Get real, man - why are you defending a company that clearly isn't even pretending to have the best interests of its customers in mind?
@_date: 2014-06-11 07:02:53
I would initiate an ACH chargeback and therefore attempt reversal on all previous transactions you've had with CB, not just the fraudulent instant purchase that they lied to you about. Your bank has your best interests in mind, and if CB's shit security caused you to lose coins, you never really received them, did you? You have just cause to reverse any transactions where you paid for something but didn't receive it; they are considered fraudulent, so you might as well get your money back.
@_date: 2014-02-08 03:02:04
I'm talking in terms of dollars so that people have a full understanding of how much of my fiat went into getting the BTC. The price of BTC is volatile, so I feel this is important. Maybe you disagree.
Whether someone is complaining about my business or not, doesn't really give Coinbase just cause to freeze my personal, private funds, for even a second. If you think it does, I don't know what to tell you, because we're going to have a fundamental difference of opinion here.
Does this mean that if I send ten complaining emails from ten different email addresses, Coinbase should freeze the accounts of any merchant I choose? That's pretty disturbing.
@_date: 2014-02-10 06:32:38
WOW. I didn't think Coinbase could get scummier, but it did. Unbelievable.
Moral of the story: never use Coinbase if you prefer not to get stolen from.
@_date: 2014-06-11 07:09:21
Coinbase is a well-respected company? You're high, dude. Tons of negative feedback from customers shows up all the time on here. They have a history of badly screwing over their userbase, freezing funds without notice, having terrible security and losing people's bitcoins, etc.
@_date: 2014-02-08 02:23:31
I already looked into Kraken, actually. I am American, and they apparently do not work with Americans for cashing out.
@_date: 2014-02-01 23:19:26
I did find a phone number for Coinbase but when I called, it went straight to voice mail. I Googled around and it appears this number is unmonitored. Actually posted here because I read that the coinbase staff sometimes monitors this subreddit, so I'm hoping I can get my issue resolved somehow. 
@_date: 2014-06-11 06:56:39
Coinbase historically fucks over its userbase and then adds insult to injury by offering garbage "support." My favorite part is when Coinbase gets called out on this stuff on Reddit, and then one of their incompetent employees trundles in and makes really bad excuses for why their security is a joke. It'll probably happen again in this thread, just watch for Olaf desperately trying to find a way to blame this guy for CB's mistake.
@_date: 2014-02-11 00:41:59
I'm not creating a problem that doesn't exist, I literally just gave you several pertinent examples and they weren't good enough for you. 
I don't need to ask someone who has dealt with their cs, because I AM someone who has dealt with their cs. It was probably the worst experience of my life, hands down, pertaining to customer service.
@_date: 2014-06-11 07:05:20
Nah, don't bother blocking future transactions. Just keep performing reversals/chargebacks every time they try to steal money from you. They can eat chargeback fees if they want to be such a scummy company. 
@_date: 2014-02-10 04:05:00
They can "feel" as shady as they want but the fact is that these exchanges have a way better track record than Coinbase.
CB is based on the states, but has a shady track record. Just because they're under US jurisdiction doesn't mean that it's going to be particularly easy for you to sue them if they defraud you.
@_date: 2014-02-10 06:44:22
Coinbase has proven itself to be a pretty unprofessional/untrustworthy company on many occasions, I don't think Facebook should endorse them or allow them to advertise there unless they're trying to get their customer base defrauded.
@_date: 2014-02-10 21:45:42
If you're against scams, why are you constantly posting pro-Coinbase opinions everywhere despite the fact that there is evidence that they've been defrauding people?
@_date: 2014-02-08 02:43:21
"Deal with me patiently?" Please. They didn't even bother to apologize after freezing over sixteen thousand dollars of my money, and then sent me a mocking email when I said I'd be bringing my case to the public.
I couldn't tell you what the customers were complaining about, as Coinbase didn't bother to share their emails with me. Regardless, I'm not going to discuss any of my businesses here, as it's not germane.
I'm very dubious that you've sent hundreds of BTC through Coinbase, "throwaway."
@_date: 2014-06-06 02:59:36
What, so you can rip off more customers with your shoddy service and insecure systems? No thanks.
@_date: 2014-02-10 06:14:18
Well I'm not saying all exchanges are created equal. Mt. Gox has obviously had some issues lately, for instance. I am just saying that, as a general rule, the exchanges are a safer bet than Coinbase.
@_date: 2014-02-09 18:30:01
More trolling, more victim blaming. What a shame.
@_date: 2014-02-08 07:00:31
CB's customer service is a joke. Here's what you need to do to reclaim your funds:
Initiate an ACH Chargeback.
It's very simple. Go to your bank and tell them the truth - that there were transfers which were not authorized by you, and that you've attempted to get the merchant to refund you but they will not. Your bank will give you the necessary paperwork to perform an ACH chargeback, which will forcibly reclaim your funds.
Do NOT wait on this, as you only have a 60 day window from the date of the transaction. Remember that your bank has your best interests in mind, not some skeezball company in California.
@_date: 2014-02-02 05:41:16
I will keep this updated throughout the resolution process, and let everyone know the final result.
@_date: 2014-02-08 20:26:00
"Too bad, so sad" is not a proper response to a consumer getting defrauded. Ever. Period. This is Coinbase's bad and they need to make amends financially. They are refusing, but thankfully there are financial structures in place which will allow OP to perform an ACH chargeback and get his money returned.
@_date: 2014-02-02 05:49:27
I bought 99% of the Bitcoin in the account from Coinbase with my own money, so, no, it's not from nefarious purposes or sources. Considering there's no way they couldn't know this, that would not just be a mistaken assumption on their part, it would be a foolish one.
They did actually freeze my account - I attempted to transfer funds out several times today and failed. It was only after I received their email that I was given the limited freedom to move my funds out of my account. 
@_date: 2014-02-08 16:52:06
Not Gox, and not Coinbase. It's becoming apparent that your coins (or even your fiat accounts) are absolutely not safe with them.
@_date: 2014-02-10 04:46:49
Not really. Everything I've seen points towards Coinbase having really awful practices, losing the customers' coins through their own carelessness, then telling them to go pound sand. This isn't a good way to do business.
@_date: 2014-02-08 02:15:37
What do you mean by that?
@_date: 2014-02-10 06:48:00
Funny you should mention that - I already have some of my guys working on this, actually. One immediate problem is that you need an insane amount of capital to start something like this up and maintain solvency, unless you resort to dirty tricks. 
In any event, my experience with CB has lead me to believe there is a huge gap in the market for competition there, yes.
@_date: 2014-02-08 16:35:33
I think this is actually quite likely. Coinbase recently scrambled to hire a bunch of people because their customer service was so garbagey. Now their customer service is still garbagey, just slightly faster.
I think it's reasonable to assume at least one of those desperation-hires is maliciously minded. And given Coinbase's security track record, I doubt they've done much to limit these new hires' power to look at your personal data or manipulate your account.
@_date: 2014-02-08 03:11:12
Wow, calling me an asshole and a cunt? That's pretty out of line.
I was making an analogy. The thing I proposed is obviously "not okay." The point I was making was that, if customer complaints are all it takes for an account to get frozen, it would be easy for ANYONE to do that. It's an untenable situation, and maybe you should read my posts a little bit more before you get so riled up.
edit: spelling
@_date: 2014-06-07 02:39:45
Yeah, they treat their own customers like shit, you really expected them to be civil to applicants? Come on, now.
@_date: 2014-02-13 02:16:28
Yeah. Coinbase has a history of only giving a shit about issues once somebody makes a big enough deal about it publicly. Otherwise they're pretty happy to quietly screw people over for their bottom line.
@_date: 2014-02-08 16:45:16
Even if you don't do this, you still hold ultimate power on what goes in and out of your accounts.
You can very easily initiate an ACH chargeback on this stuff. Boom, money returned. Never forget this, guys! These companies can't just steal your money.
@_date: 2014-02-08 20:22:55
Who exactly would I be shilling for?
@_date: 2014-02-10 18:18:21
Sarcasm isn't a valid response. If you're trying to tell me that Coinbase is a more reputable place to do business with, than, say, BitStamp, we're just going to have a fundamental disagreement I suppose.
@_date: 2014-06-11 06:52:20
Wow, Coinbase fucking over its users yet again. Color me surprised.
Get out of the sinking ship while you can, guys.

Dumb. Security through obscurity has always been an awful practice. You really think that the "bad guys" aren't able to do their research and get some insider information? Obfuscated AML policies do nothing but fuck over regular people who are just trying to do business.

**Danger, danger.** I recommend you do your homework on this. Coinbase has a history of freezing accounts, funds, etc without warning or notice. There have been a lot of stories of coins mysteriously vanishing from their online wallets, too.
Tell him to use an actual exchange, and keep coins in a private wallet until he's ready to cash them out. Coinbase is NOT friendly to merchants. Plenty of people are already calling it PayPal 2.0.
@_date: 2014-02-08 16:10:13
Coinbase came to the thread and said "lol, sorry our security practices suck, wave goodbye to your fiat, sucker." I wouldn't exactly call that an adequate explanation.
They are at fault here.
@_date: 2014-02-08 16:47:08
No, it's more like someone stealing your debit card and buying some gold bullion with it.
A perfectly legitimate situation in which to initiate a chargeback.
@_date: 2014-02-08 16:40:11
Exactly. Just because Coinbase says something does not make it so. 
Pay no mind to CoinBitch, this person has literally done nothing but mindlessly defended Coinbase throughout this entire thread. Employee, maybe?
@_date: 2014-02-10 23:03:41
This isn't 4chan, "umad" is not a legitimate response. I will say it is cute that you are desperately invested believing that I'm angry, rather than that I just think you're an infantile troll.
@_date: 2014-02-08 06:38:19
You're not making any sense anymore, which is saying something because you weren't making much sense to begin with. I'm sorry, but I can't follow whatever it is that you're trying to say.
Spouting platitudes like "cryptocurrency is a harsh teacher" and "the market is cruel" might make you think you're making yourself look like some sort of grizzled, wizened bitcoin Gandalf, but that pap isn't a good excuse for a company to conduct itself unprofessionally and hostilely to the BTC community.
@_date: 2014-06-07 15:46:35
Given Coinbase's track record, they will cut off service if they think it makes them look bad, whether or not the enterprise is actually illegal. They are as cowardly as Paypal in this regard. I've said it before, I'll say it again: avoid Coinbase unless you feel like losing your coin or getting it frozen on a whim.
Imo, if Mangatrader is gonna accept BTC they should skip Coinbase entirely and just register at an exchange to cash their BTC out. It's only a matter of time until CB shits on them otherwise.
@_date: 2014-02-10 21:05:06
Paid shill. CoinBitch is literally making things up now.
@_date: 2014-05-24 16:28:55
I don't care about that. I care about being able to turn my BTC into fiat whenever I want, with a minimum of fuss. I'm not a criminal and I won't be treated like one. So, I will continue using Bitstamp until I see this questionnaire for myself, then I will take my business elsewhere. What you people need to realize is that as the customers we have all the power, if we just decide to use it. Don't just roll over and allow companies to take advantage of you.
@_date: 2014-02-10 21:37:18
Look at this shill shilling for Coinbase. Please, blame the victim more, makes you look awesome.
@_date: 2014-02-08 03:29:19
You're a psychotherapist who has transferred hundreds of BTC through Coinbase. Uh huh. Incidentally, I'm the queen of England.
It occurs to me that I've probably spent the last hour arguing with a troll.
Giving you the benefit of the doubt, I can only say that I am not a sociopath, I am just a man who can see the flaws in a system, and has been burned by draconian, opaque, and unprofessional conduct on the part of Coinbase.
For the record, I literally even said "that's pretty disturbing" after I said that, if this is how Coinbase is going to operate, any merchant could be totally shut down with the power of a small but vocal minority. Are you just looking for things to be incensed about, or what?
@_date: 2014-02-02 18:50:54
I understand this now, but keep in mind that I am relatively new to Bitcoin and started out using Coinbase a few months ago. I did not have a full understanding of their practices, BTC itself, etc. I am in the process of educating myself.
As of last night I have moved all of my ~20 coins into a private offline MultiBit wallet. This makes me feel better about the security of my coins (if they were willing to freeze my BTC assets with no notice, who knows if they'd also have been willing to simply seize them?), but very uncertain about how I'm going to turn them back into fiat like I wanted to; unfortunately, Coinbase still hasn't gotten back to me as to why my buy/sell is still disabled. At this point their customer service has been dismissive enough that I'd like to find an alternative, but I'm having trouble finding a good one which is available to Americans.
@_date: 2014-05-24 14:50:22
We're about as likely to get a legitimate answer to these questions as we are to get an answer out of Coinbase as to why they mark and cancel transactions as "high risk" when it conveniently makes them money.
When companies fail to provide good customer service, vote with your feet. Personally, I'll be moving my coins to BTC-E if I ever get met with Bitstamp's stupid KYC questionnaire money-trap, just like I moved my coins from Coinbase when I realized they consist of scammy incompetent garbage.
@_date: 2014-02-10 06:22:00
I've since spent a lot of time educating myself on exchanges.
I will give people advice on which services to use - or, at least, which services not to use - because I have personal experience with CB's abysmal customer service. I am a merchant who had negative experiences with Coinbase, that's what I'm trying to tell you. I wasn't hacked, Coinbase just decided to can me and freeze my funds without any sort of notice. I don't want any other merchants to have to go through that sort of headache.
@_date: 2014-02-02 05:00:22
Doing this now - thanks for the advice.
@_date: 2014-02-10 04:05:53
That's a big "if", is what I'm saying. Even if he sets his account up in that way, Coinbase's track record indicates that it won't necessarily be as smooth as you describe.
@_date: 2014-06-23 04:20:26
They froze a great deal of my money without bothering to notify me or even acknowledge what happened until I made a big deal out of it on reddit. Then they essentially told me to go fuck myself with regards to ever buying or selling BTC on their system again. I consider myself lucky to have even got my coins out.
@_date: 2014-02-10 06:17:57
Off the top of my head I cannot bring you an example of a problem someone has had in that extremely narrow situation. I doubt that most merchants do that, though.
However, as I've mentioned, I am a merchant who had issues. I was also using my account as a wallet for speculation, and my personal funds got frozen in addition to my merchant services through Coinbase being canned. This happened without any sort of notice to me.
Coinbase is Paypal 2.0. Merchants should stay away. Anyone who adopts them is asking for a world of hurt.
@_date: 2014-02-08 02:15:22
I'm not saying that literally everyone who works with Coinbase is going to be jerked around the same way I did. Only that they did this to me, and will probably do it to others in the future. You may have been one of the lucky ones.
The fact that they were willing to freeze my account without even letting me know shows that no one's money is safe in their hands, period.
@_date: 2014-06-11 19:09:03
If BMM is a pool, like ghash.io, it can easily be disrupted by a DDoS. This will eventually happen from those people who are, as you say, concerned that bitcoin would then just be another centralized payment system.
@_date: 2014-02-08 16:43:35
Yeah. If I had to wager, I'd bet on this coming from inside Coinbase somehow.
@_date: 2014-02-08 03:12:43
Will do. You guys seem pretty unanimous on this point, so I have already decided to look into other exchanges first. Thank you very much. Also, if you have any specific suggestions for exchanges to look into, I would very much appreciate it.
@_date: 2014-02-10 19:58:46
@_date: 2014-02-08 04:10:07
That's also possible. But I've seen a LOT of other people reporting negative interactions with Coinbase. Enough that I seriously doubt I am in an extreme minority here.
What happened to me was totally unacceptable and unprofessional. If they treat even ten percent of their customers this way, they deserve to go out of business.
@_date: 2014-06-07 02:33:24
While I love bitcoin, this is kind of a flimsy excuse for not having a credit card. If you're so successful with your freelancing, why not start your own LLC, and tell the banks you're employed by it? Technically true, gets around all this hassle. You're already paying self-employment taxes by being a freelancer anyway, it makes sense for tax purposes for you to classify your earnings as those of a sole proprietorship LLC.
@_date: 2014-02-10 07:54:58
I am not an alt, I am a guy who got screwed over by Coinbase. I created a reddit account so I could become more active in the BTC community, educate myself, and pass my experience on to others so they don't make the same mistake I did.
I'm new here, I didn't really realize this thread was old. Sorry.
@_date: 2014-02-10 06:39:22
Don't get too excited. He's just here as a PR drone. Their actual customer support still sucks.
@_date: 2014-02-08 16:07:23
It is, actually, entirely correct.
This is how finance already works in the traditional world.
The fact of the matter is, if someone steals my credit card, and buys a nice Louis Vuitton purse with it, I can initiate a chargeback on that quite legally. The merchant then eats the cost.
He's well within his legal rights to do this and I think it is the ethical thing to do as well. Coinbase's security practices were infantile; they did not do enough to protect his coins. This man should not have give up his fiat in order to pay for their woeful incompetence.
@_date: 2014-06-07 02:46:23
Coinbase is a bad company that has a tendency to treat its customers very poorly. A lot of people don't want them advertising on because unsuspecting newbies might get caught up and lose coins due to Coinbase's incompetence.
@_date: 2014-02-10 06:35:44
Doesn't look like it's an alt to me. You, on the other hand, look like a Coinbase employee.
@_date: 2014-02-08 15:56:35
I purchased over $16000 from Coinbase. Coinbase got some mysterious complaint about my business and immediately froze over my $16000 worth of BTC in my account, and didn't even bother to let me know.
I found out by trying to sell the BTC. When I emailed them they refused to apologize or even admit what happened, told me I could transfer my BTC out, and told me I couldn't use Coinbase any longer.
tl;dr's tl;dr is that they were happy to take my fiat but when I wanted to sell the btc back, I was told to go pound sand.
@_date: 2014-06-11 06:50:50
That's actually a very interesting point. If enough people think the same, a 50% attack could become effectively impossible because the centralized pools would just get DDoSed by the fearful public as soon as they get too large. And actually, it wouldn't even take that many people - really just one determined guy with a botnet or the money to rent one. So... like it or not, is this not inevitable? I'm actually surprised there haven't been more attacks on pools perpetrated for shits and gigs by trolls.
@_date: 2014-02-19 00:58:06
would that be a Caffè Goxiano?
@_date: 2014-02-02 02:59:04
Which seller did you switch to? I'm interested in looking for alternatives now, but I was always told that Coinbase was the easiest way to exchange BTC and USD. If there are better alternatives I definitely would like to hear about them.
@_date: 2014-02-10 18:24:41
My issue with Coinbase was partially resolved insofar as I was finally able to pull my coins into an external wallet However, they have essentially banned me from interacting with their service in any other way (such as buying/selling) for reasons I don't understand - to me, it looks like they just wanted my fiat.
However, to say I didn't lose any money isn't quite right. I was about to sell my BTC before this whole Mt. Gox crash happened. So the value of my BTC has tanked badly, when I otherwise would have gotten out mostly unscathed.
You should be worried. I don't think Coinbase is safe place to store your financial details anymore. If I were you I'd skip them entirely and get registered on an exchange.
With regards to the issue in this thread: the user probably shouldn't have withdrawn the coins, sure, but CB still acted egregiously in error. That is to say, they had a right to the BTC that he pulled, not to what was in his bank account. They initiated an unapproved transfer of money from his account, and I hope they ate a chargeback in response.
Thanks for the welcome! I appreciate it.
@_date: 2014-02-10 18:27:34
Well, that sort of exists via localbitcoins, but there are some rumblings that this is now illegal (plus, to me it always seemed like a good way to get shivved in a back alley.)
It would be nice to have something reputable in that vein, though.
@_date: 2014-02-08 07:21:25
I think that is a good place to discuss issues like this, in particular so that newer Bitcoin users know to stay away from sketchy, incompetent companies like Coinbase. These sorts of discussions and stories can lead the community to realize that companies which appear reputable are actually very dangerous to transact with.
@_date: 2014-02-10 21:38:45
I upvoted and agreed with a lot of stuff he posted, sure. We both got screwed by Coinbase. That doesn't mean I'm him, you paranoid shill.
@_date: 2014-02-10 23:05:16
I am looking for Coinbase related threads and spreading awareness about their incompetence and lack of professionalism. It isn't my fault that you're there in every single one of them, shilling for Coinbase.
@_date: 2014-02-10 21:44:49
I didn't make this thread. I literally started using reddit like eight days ago. Are you drunk?
@_date: 2014-02-08 16:38:05
Putting blind faith in one of these companies is a really bad idea. I'm sure plenty of people had faith in Mt. Gox and look what's happening to their funds.
Coinbase's actions have proven deleterious for the community, especially lately. It's companies like this that give BTC a bad name.
@_date: 2014-02-10 03:31:38
If you think that your money is "guaranteed" safe with Coinbase, I don't know what to say other than that you're simply wrong. Try calling them, I dare you - the only phone number they have immediately goes to voicemail.
These people are not safe OR trustworthy. People have lost a lot of money dealing with Coinbase.
@_date: 2014-02-08 02:21:48
As I mentioned, I am new to BTC and the only thing I've used to buy or sell BTC so far is Coinbase.
I don't understand why you seem so incensed about me mentioning Mt. Gox. Is that frowned upon here for some reason? I read it was the biggest exchange.
@_date: 2014-02-08 04:07:06
Thanks for the exchange advice.
I am still not sure why you are so incensed about this. You seem to be rabidly and blindly defending Coinbase and assuming that I somehow "messed up" rather than acknowledging that this company was in error. Here's what happened:
1) I integrated my business with my Coinbase account.
2) A disgruntled customer emailed Coinbase for whatever reason.
3) Coinbase responded by quietly freezing my account and funds with absolutely no notice to me. When I came to them, they unfroze my funds and, in so many words, told me I was banned from further transactions with them.
For some reason you seem to want to believe I'm some kind of devil man who is out to scam people. Be that as it may, you cannot argue with this:
It is totally abhorrent that they froze my funds on account of a random customer complaint.
It is doubly abhorrent that I was given no notice, and had to find out by actually attempting a sell.
This sort of thing would simply never fly in the mainstream world. Imagine if your bank or stock exchange froze your funds without any sort of notice, because someone emailed them and told them to. Not a subpoena or a lawsuit of any kind, mind you, just some random guy on the internet.
You know, even PayPal, one of the worst offenders in this sort of thing, sends you an email if your account or funds are locked for any reason. This is bush league stuff. I like Bitcoin, and I want to see it succeed. But I can tell you that BTC will never be taken seriously by the mainstream if the community gives any company, including Coinbase, a free pass for this sort of unprofessional conduct.
@_date: 2014-02-02 02:59:46
What would you say merchants should be using, then?
