That's an interesting thought, but I don't see Facebook loosing popularity any time soon. 
If (when) there will be a "Facebook v2", it will be a very slow, gradual shift to it.

Do you have a link for that?

The first step is finding a project that you're truly interested in. For the beginning, a smaller one might be easier.
Then use it for a while, and you will probably find some things that could be improved. Or just check the issue tracker.
Tell the dev(s) what you want to do, and they will probably assist you.

That's when you tell them to squash the commits. And if they don't do it, you don't merge, simple as that.

On the [deposits page]( it lists a 1% fee, which I assume goes to them.
I also think it's bad that they'll keep part of the money forever once project activity goes down. For that, there should be a way for project owners to pay out remaining balance on request.

You can't build a turing machine, because it is a theoretical concept (fundamental requirement being an *infinite* tape).
You could however check if an instruction set is turing complete. I think this would be true for your proposal, assuming it is executed on a single device (not on the blockchain).

As a developer, you can just not accept the tips. In that case, I don't see why it would be a problem.

I agree that the system isn't perfect, but personally I think it provides nice incentives.
Maybe it's just not for everyone (and I wouldn't mind if it were opt-in or opt-out).

Does anyone know about [Electrum for Android]( Last blog post is from May, is it still alive?

Your view is pretty pessimistic. The current banking system has existed for less than 100 years (in todays broken form).
Humanity has managed to get rid of slavery, absolute monarchy and lots of other bad things. I'm quite sure the current economic system won't last another 100 years.

International standards can be changed, and are not mandatory afaik.

Personally, I am happy whenever someone makes the effort to contribute to my projects. Especially because this could easily be the first of many commits.
And if reviewing takes more time than it's worth, then frankly there's something wrong in the project or the review process.

I just read up on this project, really interesting.
Has there been any new info, or even source code released?

This only means that bitcoin companies will move out of NYC/will be founded elsewhere.
Personally, I'd like to see a world where the majority of tech companies isn't based in a single country.

It could work on a per-site basis.
FIrst time you access a paid site, you get a dialog "do you want to pay to access this page". And a checkbox "don't ask for future payments on this domain".

Another point about the Trezor price:
When [Valve sold Left 4 Dead for half price, sales increased by 3000%]( So this is something you might want to try.

They are still free to use the old version under the old license.
And if their business completely relies on another company, it's really their own fault.

I don't understand the point about low-effort commits.
It is completely on the developers/maintainers to validate and merge commits. If someone makes a bad commit just to grab money, it won't be merged.
If someone does a trivial fix (string or comment change) and it gets merged, it must be useful, and maybe it wouldn't have been fixed without this incentive.

Here's an idea regarding power usage:
Could 21 create a side chain that can efficiently be mined by their chips, but not by ASICs? (maybe similar to Litecoin).
Then the devices could mine other device's microtransactions at optimal efficiency.

For Linux users: The .deb doesn't seem to add lighthouse to PATH, you'll have to run `/opt/lighthouse/lighthouse`.

If they release shitty software with obvious bugs like this, it's their fault alone.
Open source makes a difference for complicated bugs, not things that should come up in the most basic use case.

Localbitcoins is actually blocked in Germany.
But you can still use it for online transfers I'd you change your location to another country.

What you are suggesting sounds a lot like [Stack Exchange]( 
They don't seem to have a site for medicine though.

There's also [Freifunk Berlin]( and various other projects in different cities.
But I'm not aware of anything that already has the micropayments part implemented.
