Seriously, bankruptcy protection was the right move in this case, whether they have found the bulk of the BTC or not.

Do you know how this could work thought? Say most people agree to a 50% haircut - halfing liabilities and making an acqui possible (and potentially very viable for a business in the right position).
Even if 99% of people were happy with that there are still going to be big lawsuits from the remaining 1%.

I think what this comes down to is that even though Gox reborn would have very little customer loyalty (or in fact quite the opposite) an new exchange designed to proceed those who lost coin would have hundreds of thousands of customers incentivized to use and promote it.
@_date: 2014-02-26 22:40:05
I agree. It seems like there are multiple factors stopping the flow of information. Even so, I still wonder how something hasn't leaked through.
If we're correct that there was not a "theft" of 744k BTC then any news to remotely support that would be good news.

@_date: 2014-02-25 18:18:33
It seems unlikely that there won't be an acquisition.
MtGox had monthly trade volume of over 1,000,000 BTC. Average trade fee of around 0.5% on either side of the transaction (1% total) means their annualized revenue run rate was in the range of $60M+ and growing at a high rate.
Even though a buyer would lose a huge number of those customers there's still a lot of value there. Plenty of early stage high risk companies are getting bought at 5-10x revenue which would cover their losses.

LOL. If your bank ceased access to your funds then waffled for an indefinite period of time about when the funds would be available, what would you do?
Read about bankruptcy protection. Apparently the Japanese process is similar to US Chapter 11. This is how things work.

I think it's pretty clear they haven't finished auditing their logs and they still don't know exactly how and where they lost the funds.
Yet again another update that fails to reveal the root of the problem.
Only interesting thing is that they're claiming they don't know where the fiat went.

Fair enough. But I think an important take-away is that this stops (or at least delays) the big players from extracting all of the assets before any smaller depositors have a chance. It presents an opportunity for us to potentially see the books and uncover the rest of the story before the company is thrown to the sharks.

Bitcoinbuilder reflects higher than 10%. The market is also factoring in the potential time it would take to get a return. Many people will take 10 cents on the dollar now on substantial holdings over a higher expected return after months or years of legal turmoil.

Josh said from the beginning he was converting all fees to GoxBTC.
@_date: 2014-02-26 22:09:12
They'll be acquired in some capacity. I think the question is whether it's after a bankruptcy proceeding (so they can unload their debt guaranteeing no return for their customers) or not. I'm not fully familiar with how these proceedings work.
I suspect that many/most Gox customers would be willing to have their accounts take a haircut if it reduced Gox's liabilities and allowed them to be acquired and brought back up. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 06:41:38
I guess what I'm saying is if you're serious you shouldn't be waiting on the Gox records. What's the downside of starting now?
@_date: 2014-02-26 22:02:48
I agree it seems unlikely that the entire BTC deficit is from theft due to malleability.
There's an unbelievable amount of speculation going on. It also amazes me that nobody has leaked or acquired a more detailed explanation of what has happened.
@_date: 2014-02-25 01:22:32
They're making a significant income from trading fees. I almost wonder if all of these weird PR activities (twitter feed deletion etc) are an attempt to trigger buying/selling sprees. If they're short on the books they could be trying to bring their reserves up to the level where they can resume business.

One might argue that building and selling mining rigs has a much lower risk and can scale faster.
For example, you could take orders and only purchase the parts from your supplier once you've been paid for the order. You need next to zero startup capital and you recoup any investment immediately.
If you purchase a mining rig you're vulnerable to both competition/difficulty and drops in the price of the currency you're mining.

You would need co-operation from MtGox to facilitate a dividend in the event of a payout, would you not? I'm assuming the idea is that someone who is desperate for cash now can trade away part of their GOX holdings immediately and the purchaser would then be eligible for a portion of the dividend?
What I think makes this even more interesting is the rumours going around that Mark is interested in facilitating a debt for equity arrangement. If you combine the Goxcoin concept with the debt for equity concept you're essentially using the mastercoin protocol to create electronic tradable shares in MtGox. If MtGox ends up liquidated you just pay out the liquidation to the GOX holders. These shares could have functionality like dividends and shareholder voting built in. I think this is fascinating.
If we're going to modernize currency then why not equities as well?
**EDIT** I see Adam mentioned the equity aspect below already.
@_date: 2014-03-07 20:29:00
It's true. This would be the biggest problem. Gox continued to allow trading and internal transfers even when the Gox price was driven down to a fraction of REALBTC value.
Some people liquidated on BitcoinBuilder, others converted to fiat within MtGox (at a drastically lower price) because they figured they should still be able to withdraw fiat.
No matter what, there's no way to completely reverse this damage.
@_date: 2014-03-25 18:30:42
Bankruptcy protection is designed for this. It gives you the ability to delay law suits while you figure things out.
@_date: 2014-02-27 03:09:17
He took the bait real hard if he didn't know.
He also references looking at bank statements and confirming that fiat delays weren't due to a lack of funds. This doesn't really reconcile with the crisis report (which states that Gox also had a major fiat deficit).

Totally agree. I'm more hoping that lots of people will ask and they'll become aware that customers want this information. I thought it would be slightly more productive than asking how Mark lost the coins.

Absolutely nothing has been confirmed. They've said there's a "high probability" they were stolen via the vulnerability that the community thinks is least likely. One way or another they don't have access to their BTC reserves. Either they don't know how it happened or they're not telling us.
@_date: 2014-03-04 20:14:41
It's not *really* anything unexpected. The US and Canada already tax trading gains and I know at least in Canada businesses are required to charge sales tax on goods sold regardless of the form of payment (even for barter transactions).
The restriction on Banks and Securities Firms is something different, however.
@_date: 2014-02-28 20:11:30
There are a lot of steps left to come here. They've only filed for *bankruptcy protection* at this point. As far as I know, the steps are as follows:
* This will give them some breathing room while the court looks at their assets and liabilities to determine the current state of affairs
* The court will attempt to find a viable way of reviving the company including negotiating with creditors so that it can return to operation and "work off" it's liabilities and return as much value as possible to creditors
* If this fails, the company will go through formal bankruptcy proceedings in which case all of it's assets will be liquidated and the court will attempt to return some value to creditors.
* Depending on how this goes down there may be a way to be listed as a creditor such that you can get a portion of this payout (however small it may be) but there is also a chance that the big accounts spend lots of money on lawyers and get their money out before the small guys get anything.
@_date: 2014-02-28 18:51:14
They've filed for bankruptcy protection meaning they will work with the courts in an attempt to structure a plan to bring the company out of bankruptcy. This will include renegotiating with creditors (Gox Customers) which could result in a haircut.
Their estimation of liabilities is totally skewed because they're using the Gox price but their net liabilities based on their calculations aren't insurmountable.
The alternative is that they proceed through formal bankruptcy and all the small creditors get absolutely nothing.
@_date: 2014-02-26 00:43:45
I think a good question to ask is what is more likely?
Gox misplacing funds in wallets or somebody actually manning to move 744k BTC to external wallets.
Perhaps it's a combination? If the IRC logs are legit then Karpeles' wording "temporarily unavailable" seems more in line with a loss of access to the wallets.
The leaked report (which still seems fishy) also claims that they lost their BTC reserves due to a "leak" which doesn't necessarily mean theft.
@_date: 2014-02-28 04:38:59
Ha. What's worse? Stolen coins or lost private keys?
@_date: 2014-03-02 22:30:07
Unfortunately it seems like Mark is going to be guilty of something, even if it's just because he continued to accept deposits when he already knew about the lost funds.
Is the FBI not already investigating this?

Hopefully this leads to some actual details becoming available.
@_date: 2014-02-26 07:22:32
Alright you got me laughing.
@_date: 2014-02-28 20:36:54
You're definitely correct, but I think it buys time which gives us an opportunity to hopefully get the full story before liquidation happens.
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:47:42
He probably held all his coins with MtGox.
@_date: 2014-02-28 19:19:50
Do we really think the FBI would put a gag on Mark when it has resulted in danger to his life?
It certainly seems plausible except for that aspect.
@_date: 2014-02-27 17:44:44
This does present a nice "grey area" for Karpeles.
If the Feds seized the cold wallet and he's current in court to get those funds released (and can't talk about it) then it's quite a predicament.
@_date: 2014-03-03 07:07:38
I don't think they know how they lost the funds. Still lots we're not being told. I doubt we'll get the full story until they've fully audited their transaction logs.
@_date: 2014-03-04 03:42:33
Arbitrage is tough with BTC-E as you pay over 1% to get fiat into the exchange (that's the fee on their end not including what your bank and intermediaries charge). When you include trading fees on both sides and more wire transfer fees to get the fiat back you're eating the vast vast majority of the profit.
With wire transfers on either side you're also looking at an approx 5 business day cycle which is painfully slow.
Not to mention you need to wire a large sum to a rather sketchy exchange.

Nobody knows when/how they were stolen yet. The information released doesn't even make sense.
@_date: 2014-03-08 06:07:13
Not at all. Bitcoin relies on a certain amount of mining power to be successful. The required power grows only when transactions grow. If transactions grow then transaction fee revenue grows. It's a self correcting system, not a false economy.
@_date: 2014-02-27 20:09:05
I think the point is that the crisis doc said they only had 2k BTC in their hot wallet and the 744k BTC were "stolen".
It now appears that the 744k theft might be inaccurate.

@_date: 2014-03-03 04:24:34
What was Mark emailing to him?
If this is legit then I'm assuming anarchystar took a big loss and was harassing Mark &amp; the Gox team.
It bothers me that there are no more details he can provide on the missing BTC.
The massively overoptimistic interpretation of this is that Gox knows who has access to the coins and law enforcement is helping them recover the stolen property. They still are under water due to fiat liabilities but if the coins are recovered then there's a buyer willing to take over the business. Seems unlikely though.
This is the second time Mark has mentioned returning the BTC as BTC, though.
@_date: 2014-02-24 03:43:12
Almost 500 BTC already bought of that ask.
@_date: 2014-03-03 04:27:58
If there's an active investigation to recover the coins why did he not just say so?

Josh Jones @ bitcoinbuilder could become one of the greatest opportunists of the last few years collecting ~$5,000,000 worth of GOX BTC in fees (should GOX BTC end up equaling real BTC).
@_date: 2014-03-02 02:23:36
I've heard this a few times.
1-(BTC/GOXBTC) price isn't the market's estimation of the likelihood of Gox returning. Time is a HUGE factor. If you have your savings tied up in GOXBTC and you need some of it NOW vs. after 9 months of court proceedings you'll take 5 cents on the dollar.
Other people think there's a good chance they'll have value and they're willing to wait so they buy in.

From 
"Do you trade on this site yourself?
Originally I did create this site with the intention of being able to use it myself. As it got bigger though, I decided the only use I should have is to convert all the "real" BTC fees I earn into GOXBTC. The reasoning behind this is two-fold.. 1. I do think gox will be fine and it's a good investment, but also 2. if somehow they're not, I want to be in the same (sinking) boat with everybody else.
In the interest of transparency, I have currently sold earned fees of 555.8972312 "real" BTC for 2212.438497 GOXBTC (average price .25126)."

I am not sure why Goxcoins would have to be trapped because there is "no value in the exchange". If there is a debt to equity arrangement resulting in goxcoins representing equity you could trade those goxcoins immediately on the same principle as trading them in hopes of recovery via liquidation.
Gox coin could remain as a freely traded cryptotoken but it would represent an equity instead of a debt.

Although this is true, the company made a statement saying that the cause of the cease of withdrawals was purely a technical issue.

Yes with caveat that customers will not be made whole.
"Not whole" could mean anything from customers getting almost all of their funds back to getting basically nothing.
@_date: 2014-02-28 06:40:00
There's nothing to stop anyone from starting a non-profit exchange right now with this mandate keeping all proceeds until account records from Gox can be obtained. The sooner it's done (while the story is big) the more you can leverage the press for adoption.
Unfortunately I think it takes a while to jump through the banking/regulatory hoops, nevermind code up a trading platform.
