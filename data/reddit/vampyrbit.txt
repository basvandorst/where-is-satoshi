Thx! Most are, but I don't want to be locked on a US service that I would need US credit cards, ID's or something like that :)

Hey all! Going to post this here too:
I'm waiting for the price drop to begin investing in Bitcoin (not much, just buying some when I can) what's the best way right now to start if I'm not on US? I do know about paper wallets but I would like an online service I can track and trade that is international, or that would not be very wise?
Another thing, should I wait that fork that everyone is talking about to buy? I'm confused on that.

Hey I think I can ask here, I'm waiting for the price drop to begin investing in Bitcoin (not much, just buying some when I can) what's the best way right now to start if I'm not on US? I do know about paper wallets but I would like an online service I can track and trade that is international. Thanks!

Yeah. I'm hoping I can return the money when it gets high, sad thing is I can't buy the dip. Well lesson learned :|
