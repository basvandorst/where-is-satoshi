That's actually a brilliant idea, isn't it?
1)  Hack BFX for millions
2)  Offer give-away of 1000BTC to anyone who lists addy
3)  Give 1000BTC to everyone who signed up (including your own dummy accounts)
4)  Sell your own coins and get lost in the noise of everyone doing the same
5) Profit!
You'd take a hit, but be more likely to get away, wouldn't you?

1)  US Interest Rates have been [effectively zero]( for the past 8 years.  An incredibly accommodative policy which has failed to jump-start the economy, as is evidenced by FOMC's inability to increase rates for fear of popping the bubble.
2)  US Debt is at an all-time high, effectively doubling since Obama took office.  Now at a staggering [$19B]( this is partly the reason why interest rates have been so low.  The higher the interest rates, the more the government needs to pay on the debt to bond holders. 
Due to the fact that many governments are now offering negative-yielding bonds and negative interest rates (see: Japan), the US has been seen as the cleanest shirt in a pile of dirty rags.  As a result, this has produced a bubble in bonds, and has pushed the yield on these US bonds to historic lows.
3)  In order to pay for the Quantitative Easing policy, the US Federal Reserve has been on [a spending spree]( increasing the money supply by more than 400% since the great recession.  The only reason this extra money hasn't shown up in inflation, is due to the Federal Reserve's policy of paying banks interest on their [excess reserves](  The moment it becomes more profitable for banks to spend this money than to save it, inflation will hit, and hit hard.
Long story short, all of these hockey stick graphs should give anyone with a sense of self preservation pause.  High debt levels and money printing are precursors to many other hyperinflation scenarios, such as post WW1 Germany and the Republic of Zimbabwe.  
TL;DR  Weimar Republic, here we come!

Market went down, either through manipulation or just natural market forces. Those people who had borrowed BTC betting it would continue to go up (Long Positions) were forced to pay for being on the wrong side of a trade/gamble. 
Many owed more than they could afford (large loss from betting wrong), and they were forced to sell all the coins they had borrowed (Margin Called).  As a result, a flood of coins entered the market, further ~~exasperating~~ exacerbating the downward trend for a short time, resulting in a snowball effect.

Ultimately it's the hypocrisy of those allegedly involved that is the most damning.  Politicians, whose very livelihood depends on taxing their constituents, were themselves exempt from that same requirement.

Or maybe the reason he was attracting so much bitcoin business was a result of this discount.
@_date: 2018-01-05 19:22:17
I'm guessing they have quite a few addressses with very small amounts left in them (probably as change / outputs from other txs) and because the fee market has continued to (healthily) grow, those funds are no longer accessible as the tx fees would exceed the amount in the account.
They fucked up and likely now have a significant amount of coin they can't realistically access. Not good.

This is such a nice change in the "What is Bitcoin" series of videos.
More often than not, these introductions try and explain bitcoin from the digital asset angle, or mining, or something along those lines.
This video, by contrast, explains what *money* is.  Fungible, divisible, portable, immutable and then offers why Bitcoin is superior.  Particularly when talking about inflation, this is perhaps bitcoin's strongest appeal to the average person in today's economy.  A store of value!
Very well done.

A company or person puts a disclaimer on their website which says something to the effect of "I  have *not* been served with a secret government subpoena."
So if they are served with a gag order, they take down the canary (as in a canary down a mine shaft) to let others know that they have been compromised by court-order.
It's a clever way of telling people you're subpoenaed without directly stating it.

Unfunded liabilities.
Baby-boomers are going to retiring in large numbers in the next few years, and expecting pensions that are far to generous for what has been funded. A demographic winter will shift the majority from those that pay into the system to those who take out of the system.
Pensioners living on fixed income will be forced to sell stocks and bonds, leading to a precipitous fall in the markets.

Are you actually saying that hospitals change their prices depending on how badly a patient needs help?
If only there was some way to protect yourself against large expenses in time of need. Like car insurance, except for your health care.
Maybe we could can it "health insurance".
Strange idea, I know, but it could work in theory.
@_date: 2015-12-25 10:49:33
You do realize that the state is funded by taxpayers (a.k.a "the patient") right? You pay one way or another, the question is which way is cheaper?
A) Directly, from patient the healthcare provider.
B) Through a middle-man (i.e. The Government).
The first has an incentive to keep costs low to remain competitive in an open market, the second has incentive to remain inefficient to encourage larger funding from the next budget to fix its inefficiencies.

YouTube: 
Another similar video worth watching: 
@_date: 2015-12-25 10:22:53
Interesting counter-point, but I must say I disagree.
"Although redistributive policies may reduce efficiency of the system, they can also increase average quality of life."
1) Taxation is theft. Taking money from constituents by force, regardless of the benefits, is wrong since it is not a voluntary act. All arguments beyond this are moot.
2) Quality of life for whom? Of course the people receiving the benefits are quite happy with the arrangement, but what about the people whose bank accounts have been recruited for service? Look up "Distributed Costs, Concentrated Benefits" for more.
3) You gave no evidence or statistics to support this claim.
"Diminishing marginal utility limits how much the ultra-rich can appreciate their wealth."
1) What is wrong with the accumulation of wealth? Wealth can be viewed as an individual's value to society. The greater good you can provide, the greater you stand to earn as a result. This is why people like Bill Gates and Satoshi Nakamoto have amassed large fortunes. Neither of these two coerced anyone, and by exchanging their wares they have benefited society in far reaching ways, which I would argue warrants a considerable reward.
2)  Are you really suggesting that inefficiencies are an effective way to limit wealth generation? This is akin to saying "Brakes are a great way to slow down a car, even if they do catch fire from overheating now and then".
"Lastly, there are a whole lot of reasons to believe that naked capitalism is not so efficient after all / wealthy special interests corrupt political process"
This is known as regulatory capture and is evidence that a free market is not present. Government intervention and special interests limit competitive entry, and intrude in voluntary transactions where both parties would otherwise come to a mutually beneficial agreement, else they would not interact.
If you are interested in learning more, I suggest you check out r/anarchocapitalism. Bitcoin is a nice introduction to many of these ideas, but there is much to learn.

Evolutionary differences trump social principles every time.
Men are more willing to take risks, women are more averse.
@_date: 2015-12-25 07:10:37
If you think building a bridge to nowhere is going to solve our problems, think again.
The only way capital can be effectively allocated is by the free market. Government intervention in the form "work projects" merely takes the legitimate earnings of the productive and redistributes it through force by the tyranny of the majority. A politician knows no better than you or I where capital can be best applied for the improvement of society. 
On the other hand, if you allow the individual to apply funds in the way they best see fit, you have a recipe where the *risk and reward* is borne by that person alone. 
I believe Milton Friedman put it best on one of his first trips to China following the opening of the Crimson curtain.
When brought by political leaders to witness the construction of a canal by its people, he asked "Why are the men using shovels to excavate the soil instead of large earth-movers?"
A representative replied, "Well, you see, if we used large earth-movers it would put many of these men out of work."
"Oh," replied Friedman, "so it's a jobs project. I thought you were trying to build a canal. If it's jobs you want, take away their shovels and give them spoons..."

Long term proposition:  If difficulty continues to go up, is it possible that miners will no longer be able to crack the SHA-256 code in a couple of years?

@_date: 2014-11-17 01:24:03


Exactly - which is why many of us here believe Bitcoin will prove to be a counter-cycle investment vehicle.  I'll grant you that Bitcoin likely won't be viewed as a safe investment for most people, but there are many people out there who have a rudimentary understanding of this technology who may be prompted to invest when economic forces no longer allow them to sit idly on the side lines.
This is all speculation of course, but I'm willing to bet that many people will rush to BTC when there is trouble in the financial industry.  Just look at November 2013 - many people attribute the rise in value due to Chinese interest, which - while certainly true, also fails to give credit to the crisis the US was undergoing simultaneously with regards to the fiscal cliff and looming default.
But then again, I could be wrong.  Just my two bits :)

Reply to Edit:  "Power" (by my definition at least) is used in the context of "over another person".  I don't have power when I own a car (even though some times it feels that way :)  A person does have power when they can pass laws which tell others what they can or can't do, like which drugs are OK or which currencies are legal.
Power to own property is still consistent with anarchy because there is no implied hierarchical structure in effect.  The power to tell others what to do does.

Given that many of us in the Bitcoin space came here in order to avoid the inflation of fiat currency, and considering that a hyper-inflation scenario is a very real possibility in the near future for many of us - I'd like to know if any of you out there know what precipitated the collapse of the Weimar Republic and if we are approaching that point ourselves with the US's recent economic policy?

@_date: 2014-02-12 18:12:10
No different as what happens today.  If you rent a house / apartment, you are bound to the rules of the property owner.  It's their property so I have no right to initiate changes without their consent.  Of course, before I sign any kind of lease or contract with a landlord, I would make sure I can abide by and accept the terms they lay out.  
If your question was to imply that those without property have no say in the social system and how it works, it would be fair to say you would have a diminished influence on the system at large, but your opinions would still be considered.  I'll give the example with bitcoin and you can then apply it to more broad terms on your own.
For the purposes of this analogy, "bitcoin" can be considered to be synonymous with "social law".
With bitcoin, it is in the best interest of those in the community to encourage my participation.  The more members they have, the more influence they can exert which gives them a greater ability to manipulate their environment to their satisfaction.  For this reason, they will do what they can to make bitcoin more accesible/appealing to outsiders (by way of more user-friendly transactions, advantages over competing currencies, etc.).  
If I accept their attempts to lure me in, then we both win.  They have added another member to their community, and I have the advantage of participating as well with the added benefits which were previously stated.  If I choose to abstain, the community will either need to change further to win my support, or will continue on regardless.
It is a form of "natural selection" within society.  If bitcoin turns out to be flawed, the community will be abandoned for a superior one.  If bitcoin continues to succeed, those who abstain will become a diminishing minority and find their lives will become more and more difficult without the support structure that used to exist in the past.
This is a non-coercive way to implement social changes.  You can still choose to be a bigot / against-bitcoin, but as the world continues forward without you, you will quickly become an outcast.  
@_date: 2014-02-12 16:49:16
Further:  If you're wondering where these rules come from that allow property ownership in the first place in an anarchic model, these rules are developed through consensus, in exactly the same way bitcoin is.  No one  person makes the rules for bitcoin or dictates how the protocol will work, but instead we as a community (through trial and error) arrive at a consensus which is accepted by the majority of the participants.  
The same could apply with laws in general.

Anarchy means "without rulers", not "without rules".  That one letter makes a big difference.  It is a system built upon voluntary involvement.

Implement the NAP (Non-Aggression Principle).  The point you make is exactly the problem:  i.e. someone else deciding what's in my best interest. Democracy is often described as 2 wolves and a sheep voting on what to have for dinner.. :/
You don't need to *go* anywhere to implement this, just tell everyone that "what's mine is mine, and what's yours is yours, and what you do with your stuff your business.  But the moment you come on *my* property and start telling me what I can and can't do with *my* stuff, then we have a problem."

Furthermore, "for-profit-medicine" is a good thing.  No one works for free, and that 'poison' you speak of is expensive stuff.

Exactly, price per bitcoin will grow to accommodate the growing economy.
This is the problem with demand-side economists, their world-view is completely incompatible with bitcoin or any dis-inflationary currency.  Gold is also a dis-inflationary currency which backed every major currency successfully until the 1970's.  When Nixon pulled the US of the gold standard, the after effects were ridiculously high interest rates and stagflation.  Economist couldn't predict this because their way of thinking was completely backwards.

Relevant quote I came across on the CoinDesk comments page:
"Bitcoiners are like Gold-Bugs - it's always a good time to buy.  When the price is at an all time high, it's proof of concept.  When the price is low, it's a great time to buy.  When the price suddenly rises, get in fast before you miss your chance.  When the price suddenly drops, get in quick before it turns around."
I couldn't find the direct quote, so I've paraphrased.
I'm not saying I disagree with you as I'm also investing in a DCA way.  I just found it to be an interesting perspective.

I'm going to play devil's advocate here:
This is an opportunity for Core proponents to demonstrate an effective fee structure in a relatively low risk environment.
If the market is able to self-govern and people use software that allows them to set mining fees, Core can claim a bit of a victory here.
If, on the other hand, mempool continues to grow and user experience continues to slide, I would hope this points to larger blocks.
Either way, it's fascinating to see this play out without the worry of any software problems.

Thanks for the reply.  I'm still trying to wrap my head around it all.
Everyone seems so emotionally invested and everyone appears to make good points, it's hard to tell who is right especially to a non-coder such as myself.  I have to trust the experts, and when I have two of them in heated opposition it's fairly easy to just fall back on reputation (i.e. I know Gavin has been around for a long time, ergo he knows what he's doing, but it does seem like he's outnumbered).
A video debate would really help my understanding I think.  Know of anything like that?
I really appreciate what you said, and my original reply was a way of me phrasing it in terms that I don't object to.  I like the idea of everyone being able to have a node (although I don't particularly understand the significance of why this is important).  
My biggest hurdle is in the understanding of limiting blocksize for the purpose of a fee system.  If the blocksize is allowed to grow to infinity, even if fees are low, wouldn't the sheer number make up the difference when compared to a limited size?  How is the security of the system compromised here, as other have suggested?  Plus, since it is a disinflationary currency fees shouldn't have to be huge to still incentivize the miners.
And spam doesn't really bother me; if you don't pay to play, you get put at the back of the line, simple as that.  Technically speaking, even if it is spam that pays more per tx than I did and gets priority, who am I to call it spam?  
And lastly, what about Moore's law? Doesn't the network need to grow anyway with increases in network speeds and power?  I'm not saying infinity, but at least more than 1MB?

1)  ETH blockchain bloat is already becoming a serious issue in such a nascent cryptocurrency
2)  Its claim to fame as being 'Turing Complete' is being made redundant by transactional layers for bitcoin such as Rootstock
3)  It is **massively inflationary** as a currency with no upper bounds on currency limit, and thus no store of value
4)  Its underlying security model (proof-of-work / proof-of-stake) is yet to be fully established
I'm sure there are others, but even a cursory look at ETH leads me to have serious concerns.

1) Current fees to be included immediately in the blockchain are &lt;$0.05. I wouldn't say this is anything to be worried about.
2). The protocol is open source. If you believe this strongly about it, fork the code.

Wealthy or not, preferential service on the blockchain goes to who pays the most. I could be dirt poor, but if I absolutely need my transaction processed immediately, I'll pay the (now negligible) fee to make it happen.
But what if I am wealthy and running a business? My ability to pay more than my competitors indicates that I can make better use of these resources for profit than they can (in this case, that resource is time). And because I can more effectively use this resource, the economy as a whole benefits.

Dear Penthouse,
I never thought it would happen to me.
I was just a simple prairie boy, plowing the fields in the hot summer heat.  Spreading my seed.  Working for pennies, not a dime to spare.
She was exotic.  New to town, but stirring up controversy everywhere she went.  I tell you, she stirred something in me too...
I first met her at my local bank.  I was there depositing my most recent paycheck.  The teller said, "It'll be in your account in 3-5 business days, provided Farmer Johnson isn't on our blacklist."  I was stunned.  I needed that money now!  If I didn't spend it immediately, it was going to depreciate by 2% a year - if I was lucky!  That's 50% less purchasing power after 17 years!  
And what if the powers that be decide on another bail out?! They'll just fire up the printing presses to support their banker friends while the rest of us suffer under a weakening dollar.  How is that just?
 How could this happen in a First-World country in the 21st century?! 
Seeing an opportunity, she approached me.
"Hello, I'm Ms. B.  I have a feeling I can help solve your money problems.  Perhaps you'd like to come with me." 
The sultry way she spoke...the confidence in her movement.  I was smitten.
We left the bank and got in her car. It was a brand new Lamborghini Aventador. I had never seen a real one in person before, and now I was in one!  The way she handled the curves made me wonder how I'd handle hers...
We pulled up to her house.  I'd never seen such luxury before.  She motioned me inside, I had no idea what to expect.
"I have something to show you" she said as she sauntered up the stairs. I followed in a dream.
She took my hand and sat me on the bed. "I'll be right back..."
I was impatient.  "But how long?"  She winked at me and said, "Give me 10 minutes.  It'll be worth the wait."
My mind raced.  Where did she go?  What is she doing? What should I do? I could have sworn I heard the sounds of banks of computer whirring, but it was probably just my imagination...
It didn't take me long to find out!
She reappeared in the doorway, wearing nothing but a thin lace nighty. "I may be new on the block, but this isn't my first rodeo..."
She took her hands and cupped her voluptuous breasts. "I'd like you to meet my best friends.  This one is 'SHA256' and this is 'ECDSA'. I don't go anywhere without them."
A weird name for tits, but whatever, I was horny.
She pounced on me in a flash.
It was passion the likes of which I had never seen before! Our bodies intertwined in raw passion and lust.  It wasn't long until I was ready to make an input...

Gold derives it’s value from its intrinsic properties, not from its utility.
Example: Gold was used in jewelry precisely because it was valued, displayed to show status. Not the other way around. Tin doesn’t suddenly become more valuable if people start wearing it around their necks.
And when it comes to gold’s use in electronics, that is a fairly recent phenomena. If that was the source of gold’s high valuation, it would have been worthless pre-1950s.

No offence taken. I sat down and spent a few hours at it a couple years ago and got as far as opening the port (no clue what that is or what it means), and that’s pretty much what stopped me. I didn’t want to potentially open myself up to an attack vector from the outside and a bunch of warning messages popped up basically asking “are you really, really sure you want to do this?” And when it comes to my financial well being, I decided it wasn’t worth the risk.
Having a stand alone node which is plug and play makes this so much easier for me.

Yes, we are betting that this technology will become big one day.  
It’s no different than purchasing MSFT or AAPL stock in anticipation of large adoption. I believe in the product, but I’m also keen enough to recognize a profitable trend, and there is nothing wrong with that.


That’s debatable. Lately the community has been over-run with “Get-Rich-Quickers” and Lambo-kids.  Most of us come from a Libertarian background based in Austrian economics.  Current prevailing wisdom from popular economists favour Keynesianism.  It’s not that we don’t understand finance (in fact, we are keenly aware of the difficulties of money transfer in general), it’s just that we disagree with current economic models.


I’ve already purchased a number of things with Bitcoin. Online and in-person.  Perhaps you lack the vision to differentiate what *may be* from *what is*.  Certainly, this economy is small, but it’s no different than scoffing at the nascent internet in 1994 because “I don’t know anyone who has an email”.

I sure hope you weren’t expecting a coherent answer from someone who calls themselves “CptnCoke”! ;)
To answer your question, banks can make the on-ramps to bitcoin very difficult (and already do to a large extent). 
Fortunately this only affects fiat transfer. If people instead trade goods or services for bitcoin, this is bypassed entirely. Only when bitcoin is ubiquitous will this be possible, and that may take time. But just like asking someone in 1994 if they have email, while the answer today is “few” that will begin to change as more people find a use for it.

Depends on the province: You pay Federal and Provincial taxes on 50% of your gains.  Top bracket of the Federal Taxes is 33%, most other provinces vary between 11-15%. So you’re looking at between 44-49% of 50% = 22-25% of total.

"I learned everything I needed to know in Kindergarten."
So much of what passes for education these days is little more than busy-work and babysitting.
In the past, children would shadow their parents, learning life skills and possibly a trade in the process.
Those that were exceptional would either pay or use scholarships to attend higher learning.
The sad truth is that even with the wide availability of educational institutions, humanity has failed to resolve the fact that intelligence exists on a bell curve, and there is only so much schooling can do to raise the average IQ.
In the modern era, we no longer have the need for monolithic institutions to house our young while we work. There are websites like Khan's Academy and other online sources (Wiki) where the inquisitive and autodidacts among us can build our repertoire.  Ultimately it falls to the individual to determine their own success.
Manifest Destiny, and all that.
Building schools in the Third World may do a lot to help relieve colonial guilt, but at the end of the day, in many countries where the average IQ is in the mid/low 70s (a full 2 deviations below global average), there is little that can be done to improve their conditions in life.  At that level, modern armies won't even issue you a firearm because you are too dangerous to yourself and others.

Hi u/butfirstbeer ! Thanks for the warm welcome!
I’m new to this whole bitcoiny thing but I just bought £50,000 with my Coinbase App. Is that OK? I don’t really have any more that that, and I’ve already sold my car and my mattress to even get that much.
I tell all my friends and family about it. My parents even loaned me about £5000 so I could buy more. I showed them how much it has grown in the past year and they believe like I do that it will be 500K-$1M in 3-5 years. Since this is the case, should we buy more? I was even thinking about selling my house and living in a cardboard box for a while. Do you think that’s a good idea?
And what’s a wallet? I don’t really understand what bitcoin is or how it works, I just want to make money and buy a Lamborghini in a few weeks.
And how can I sell when he price goes down 0.01%?
Thanks, any help is greatly appreciated.

Or you could let entrepreneurs build businesses which evaluate the long-term effects of certain chemicals and provide guidance to consumers.  Maybe companies will seek out this business for a “stamp of approval” they can place on their products to gain interest and market share, increasing their profits.
The business gets the advantage of a good reputation and more money, and is able to offset the costs of research on the free market, while the entrepreneur has just built a new field and can watch his business grow, accountable to the consumer to ensure his reputation stays sterling.

@_date: 2017-10-25 23:18:12
Good questions.
1) It’s the same, only backed by BTC, so it has the advantage of being disinflationary.
2) Cryptographic audits of the issuing company to ensure 100% reserves. Free market would diminish unsavoury actors.
3) From the perspective of the consumer, you have all the benefits of a paper currency (including its flaws), with the added benefit of being pegged to BTC.
To reiterate, this is only something that would be useful when access to a blockchain is severely limited (as in the case of natural disasters). It’s not an ideal answer, but it’s an idea.
Personally, I really like the idea suggested by another user regarding pop-up kiosks with blockchain access via satellite offering market services. It’s a far better idea than mine.

Every time you click on "Generate New Address" a completely new Private Key / Public Address was created.

My only experience comes from Coinbase for regular coin purchases and I find them quite convenient (maybe some other traders can weigh in on Kraken or Bitstamp).  All the other exchanges that I used to buy from are now defunct, so I guess that's a sign I've been around for a while.
As for Coinbase, downtime issues aside, they are very user-friendly.  They can allow regular pre-scheduled buy times and you can connect your credit card or bank account (US only AFAIK) for ease of use.  It depends what country you're in.  If you're in Canada or the US you should find Coinbase a relatively easy service.  They take a small fee for their service (in Canada it's 3.99% for credit/debit card buys - [see website for more]( and it's fairly straight forward.  They also have litecoin and ethereum markets if that's something you're interested in.
Bitstamp, Bitfinex (careful with this one, it was hacked recently), Kraken and others are more for the professional user who knows exactly what they're doing.  You can trade on margin (borrowed funds to increase profits / losses), and a number of other features for the more technically savvy.  Even for someone like me, I find their websites quite daunting, and unless you know exactly what you're doing I'd warrant an element of caution.
As far as trying to avoid downtimes, I would say to be patient and don't rush.  It's easy to get caught up in the euphoria of a bull market where it seems everyone is making money but you - but the most tried and true way to make money over the long haul is using DCA (dollar-cost averaging) where you only purchase a little amount on a regular basis in order to isolate yourself from large market swings.  You won't make as much as going all-in in a bull (up) market, but you also won't lose as much in a bear (down)  market.
And never invest more than you can afford to lose.  We all believe in this technology, but there is still the posibility that this whole thing could go to $0, so buyer beware.

Coinbase's main problem right now in my opinion is access.  They're getting swamped with new clients and their servers are unable to hold up under the pressure.  Your coins are still there, and as long as you don't lose your password, they will continue to be there.  Coinbase keeps something like 97% of its coins in cold storage, meaning no hack will compromise more than 3% of customer deposits.
This highlights the fact that you do not control the coins - they do.  A significant feature of bitcoin is that you have the control.  But as many before have said, "if you don't control the keys, you don't control the coins."
I would say that small amounts of funds for short times are OK on a website like Coinbase, but I recommend you look into getting a hardware wallet like Ledger or Trezor for long-term storage.  Ledger has a pretty good price point on its Nano so I would recommend for someone starting out.
Coinbase gives you ease of use, and they are *probably* the best exchange out there, but that's not a guarantee.
But for the love of god, if you are going to store coins online, stay away from blockchain.info!  Nothing but bad news over there.

Trading alt-coins is a quick way to get wrecked.  During the last bubble, altcoins went into bubble territory as well, but they top quicker than BTC and fall harder.  If you already had some alts, congrats! - I'd get out soon.  If you're looking to buy, you're probably buying a top.

The best way to learn is by doing.  Set-up a wallet and play around with small amounts to see how it works before investing big.  Sadly, due to transaction fees, this may be slightly prohibitive until a scaling solution is agreed upon, but don't let that discourage you.
As far as hacking goes (or known security issues), as I mentioned bitfinex and blockchain.info are high on that list.  In terms of being shutdown, most prominent web wallets or exchanges are compliant with local regulations and authorities so that's not really an issue anymore for the big players.


I would strongly recommend against this.  Unless you have a lot of very cheap electricity and economies of scale to invest big, you will never see a return on your initial investment of mining hardware.

I've not heard anything in the bitcoin space regarding this.  I'm a free-market advocate so I have no issue with ISPs choosing to be selective with what they offer, provided I am free to choose other ISPs who more closely meet my needs.
As far as bitcoin is concerned, [this article]( does a fair assessment of the pros/cons.  Personally, I'm not worried.  A bitcoin transaction can be transmitted in such creative ways as by [paper]( using  or even by emojis!  A bitcoin transaction string can be simplified into 16 random emoji characters, sent to the network and the transaction will go through.  So it is very unlikely, if not impossible to censor bitcoin.
And no worries!  I'm here to help!

That's how big bitcoin is, it is 100x bigger than Google!](  And keep in mind, that article is a few years old now, so it's probably even less. So, no, we don't have to worry about a corporation or government co-opting the network.  
But even if a company in theory had enough computer power to take over the network, it would be in their best interest to keep it running in order to protect their own profits.  Why would you spend billions of dollars investing in the ability to take over a technology just to throw it away?  In any case, it'll never happen.
If they decide to mine and buy up bitcoin, then hurrah!  Price goes up, and will likely stay up for the aforementioned reasons.
There are already numerous competing cryptocurrencies, many being made every day, but most are worthless.  Bitcoin is the largest, first and most secure.  If you start a new coin, your network is small and then it is easy to take over (as in the Google example).  That can't happen with bitcoin.

The last thing Campbell Harvey wants is to find himself playing the role of Lawrence Summers in The Social Network, who had to adjudicate arguments between Mark Zuckerberg and the Winklevoss twins when he was president at Harvard University.
“We do not want a Facebook situation,” Professor Harvey says, explaining why students on his bitcoin course at Duke University’s Fuqua School of Business have to sign “no poaching” contracts and non-disclosure agreements.
If all goes according to plan, the course will launch nine hot start-ups, ready to take advantage of venture capital enthusiasm for the much-hyped virtual currency — and all without any cross words or legal fights.
Think of it as a “semester-long business hackathon”, Prof Harvey says, “and think of me as the VC professor. The lone requirement of the course is to propose a venture that is related somehow to the bitcoin blockchain.”
While sceptics may doubt there could be Facebook-style riches at stake, particularly since the price of a bitcoin collapsed last year, the claims being made for the technology’s revolutionary potential are only getting grander.
This is why Prof Harvey, a professor of finance, and other US academics have created courses that offer the study of the virtual currency, including the legal and economic issues that it raises and, most importantly, the technology that underlies it.
In depth
As interest in Bitcoin increases, US officials are looking into how to regulate, rather than shut down, the virtual currency
Further reading
“We are staking out some academic territory and trying to get the university’s brand associated with a new body of knowledge,” says David Yermack, the finance professor at New York University’s Stern Business School, whose MBA course, created with law school colleague Geoff Miller, finished before Christmas. “This is an entrepreneurial venture for us.”
Bitcoin was created in the wake of the financial crisis by an anonymous computer scientist keen to displace central banks, government currencies and the traditional banking system. But while the currency he created attracted high-minded libertarians and people of lower motives, such as drug dealers and money launderers, it is the technology that allows the ownership of a bitcoin to be transferred from one user to another which is generating enthusiasm among venture capital investors.
Known as the blockchain, this transfer mechanism could be expanded to move almost any financial asset, with potential applications for writing wills, selling houses or agreeing derivatives contracts.
“Most financial contracts can be put in the blockchain,” Prof Harvey says.
Some visionaries go even further. Because the blockchain is based on unique keys that validate a user’s identity, they think it could be a way to allow you to start your car, open the door to your house or send secure texts.
Both the Duke and NYU courses are interdisciplinary. At Duke, MBA and law students have been partnered up with computer science students to create up to nine mini start-up teams and, according to Prof Harvey, angel investors and venture capitalists are already offering work space and money for field trips, as they sniff around for access to potential new companies.
FT Lexicon
Bitcoin 
Bitcoin is a digital currency. Instead of printing banknotes or minting coins, a list of the registration numbers of each “coin” and who owns them is kept. People pay one another by transferring the numbers online. But the system is anonymised so although there is a register, it is extremely difficult to track who owns what. This has attracted illegal acts in the past.
Businesses have now started accepting the currency as a means of payment. A list of retailers that accept Bitcoin can be found on Coinmap.org.
Blockchain 
The blockchain is essentially a giant record book of all Bitcoin transactions. In this decentralised network, every bitcoin transfer is verified, processed and written down.
The network relies on a combination of code-breaking and crowdsourcing that has the potential to make economic interactions cheaper, faster and more secure.
The idea is to remove the need for middlemen, banks for example, to vouch for facts, such as a person’s identity or the health of their finances.
One such angel investor is Rahul Pagidipati, who looks after his family’s portfolio of investments in the healthcare industry and believes that
insurance premiums and medical records could be transferred via the blockchain.
“It is probably going to happen in a college town,” he says. “Hopefully Duke will be one of the universities from which some really cool blockchain technologies will come out over the next few years.”
The NYU course leans more heavily on the financial and legal ramifications of the core virtual currency and has been following how regulators worldwide are dealing with it.
Bitcoin has been effectively banned in some countries, such as Russia, while the US and the UK have allowed a certain amount of experimentation, even though they have pursued those using it for illegal acts.
It is this legal focus that attracted law student Eduardo Petry Veronese to the course.
“After two big legal issues, a bankruptcy and a global criminal case, I got very interested in bitcoin — just like any good lawyer should,” he says. After graduation, he hopes to get involved in bitcoin regulation in his native Brazil.
In contrast to many of his students, who see bitcoin as a new kind of gold standard and a check against inflation, Prof Yermack casts himself as a bitcoin sceptic, at least when it comes to the potential to establish a global currency outside the purview of central banks.
He says his mission is to convert enthusiasts for the currency into enthusiasts for the underlying technology.
“What we are teaching is a set of issues and technologies,” he says. “The technology cannot be reversed. Certain sectors of banking are ripe for disruption, such as international money transfer, and bitcoin may be only a first move in what could be a real change in the payments system, so we are going to stick with this.”
It is a view echoed by Prof Harvey at Duke, the idea that something important has been invented, even if no one is quite sure what it is yet.
“If you are teaching international finance, you are derelict not to give some attention to this invention,” Prof Harvey said.
“Even if it does not work out, you have got to talk about the ideas percolating out there.”

The same as it is for gold. It is (for all intents and purposes) all mined out, yet it continues to be an effective store of value.
I, for one, am not concerned and believe Bitcoin holds a great deal of long-term promise.

The argument was already provided.  To quote *"banking (specifically fractional reserve banking) is considered theft".*  
And if you're already familiar with FRB, this should require no further explanation.  For the sake of clarity, however, I'll provide it now:
The creation of currency through the FRB is akin to counterfeiting, and allows a few federally sanctioned actors to inflate the money supply.  If it is illegal when a private citizen does it, why not too when performed by a banking entity?
But this does not change the fact that your comment in no way sought clarity.  You did not ask for an explanation.  You did not provide a counter-argument.  You simply derided something you didn't understand by calling it "sketchy".
This is ad hominem.  And consequently, \

Every 4 years the rate of issuance of Bitcoin is reduced by half. At the beginning it was 50 BTC every 10 minutes, by 2011 it became 25 BTC, and so on.
It is currently being issued at 12.5 BTC every 10 minutes, with the next forecast reduction to take place in about 18 months time.
Many people here believe that a reduction in supply will naturally lead to an increase in price, assuming demand stays constant or even increases during that time.

Stay away from Ether!  The "turing-complete" phrase is a [red herring according to none other than it's founder and creator!](
Furthemore, because the code required to make it turing-complete is not as resilient as with bitcoin, it opens it up to a number of new attack vectors for hackers to exploit (see: DAO).  Besides, Rootstock for BTC offers the same feature, so it becomes redundant.
Unlimited coin issuance (unlimited inflation), blockchain bloat, a mutable blockchain (edited during the hard-fork) and significant pre-mine make ETH a ticking time-bomb!
Stay away!

*com·mu·nism (noun):*
*a political theory derived from Karl Marx, advocating class war and leading to a society in which all property is publicly owned and each person works and is paid according to their abilities and needs.*
Karl Marx describes in his Communist Manifesto, the ten steps necessary to destroy a free enterprise system and replace it with a system of omnipotent government power, so as to effect a communist socialist state. 
One of the ten planks within the Communist Manifesto is:
**Centralization of credit in the hands of the state, by means of a national bank with state capital and an exclusive monopoly.**
