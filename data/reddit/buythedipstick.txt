Binance uses Tether as a trading pair, nothing more. They do not operate with fiat. Tether is not a replacement for fiat on binance. It's simply a trading pair option and a weak one with only 1/10 the number of pairs as ETH and BTC and BNB. Stop spreading horseshit.

correct. it's a word seed.

In a sense, there is no such thing as "beyond infinity", since infinity can't be reached. In geometry however, if you go "beyond" infinity, you start coming back to your starting point from the opposite direction. Just like crossing the half-way point of a circle.
So look within the circle then. Find 12 pairs.

the rule I followed is that at least one word with a line through it has to hit a number, then find semi-logical match. 
@_date: 2018-05-21 11:35:52
yes, I missed define and stay. define paper is good.
I stuck to process of deduction based on clues. They should have provided one larger font word as a clue if there were relevant, so I assumed they're not. If they are, these clues suck.

Final theory since I've really run out of time.
Find pattern based on clues.
There are numbers 1-12 in the picture, means 12 pairs of words "think in paris". All appear in the white except 3, 5, 10, 12. White Bip words will correspond with white numbers, and orange with orange. 
If you draw lines through the words at the same angle of the words provided in the clues you get the following...
CODE EASILY ----&gt; 1 (big number one) ATTACK EARLY -----&gt; 2 (happens to go through no.2) ALMOST OPEN ----&gt; 9 (line through 9...coincidence?)
Highlighted all white bip words in green and all orange bip words in blue. Drew lines through all words except 5, those didn't go through but came close. At lease ONE word from each pair must intersect a number to get the order. Pairs probably make semi-logical sense like the clues and likely form a message in total. 
In the image...white numbers with green words, orange numbers with blue words.
Work available here:
Final effort:
01 code easily 
02 attack early 
03 like paper 
04 just course 
05 provide ability 
06 pool risk 
07 post cash 
08 agree online 
09 almost open 
10 entire race 
11 modify sign 
12 end fee 
If this helps anyone please consider some love.

I've run out of time. But I'd like to share my last theory based on the clues.
The numbers and equations are a distraction. It's a process of deduction. Remove everything that isn't the Mnemonic based on clues.
There are 12 pairs of words that linguistically "match" making 24 total. Their order is determined by the 12 numbers in the coin and words that intersect those numbers when you draw a line. Couldn't find 10 but went with it anyway. 
After coloring the only eligible words green (blue inside the BTC symbol) I started by drawing lines through the words in the clues provided. I ignored the blue words inside the BTC because none of the three clues had any words inside the BTC.
CODE EASILY ----&gt; 1 (big number one)
ATTACK EARLY -----&gt; 2 (happens to go through no.2)
ALMOST OPEN ----&gt; 9 (line throug 9...coincidence?)
After drawing lines through the words in green to find corresponding numbers sticking strictly to those rules I ended up with something like this...(note 8, 12 were interchangeable - and 10 was nowhere to be found so I guessed with remaining words) Remember think in "pairs".
1 - code easily
2 - attack early
3 - agree online (consensus?)
4 - just rely 
5 - post sign
6 - pool risk
7 - cash gap
8 - old law
9 - almost open
10 - find air (lol - there's no 10!)
11 - modify course
12 - want end (end want lol)
All those words are eligible and go through those corresponding numbers which I assumed were the order.
If anyone plugs these pairs into their python script and solves it, or just solves it based on 90% of the work I've done for you, I'd settle for 50% of the prize :). 
Here's my work:

@_date: 2018-05-22 21:05:14
not really. tried drawing lines, connected words to see patterns but nothing came up. the only eligible bip39 word is almost, which is twice referenced as a clue. "almost open" "cost almost users"
Do you think all Bip39 words are eligible or only the ones with smallest font? Trying to reduce reduce reduce. The only Bip39 words used in clues were ALL small font. Coincidence? edit: also every clue word is inside the btc circle, correct?
@_date: 2018-05-20 22:24:47
That's possible but then you'd need to find a replacement for 9. "Open" goes right through 9 and hits "almost" perpendicular. Who knows.
@_date: 2018-05-22 18:44:51
I grouped all words into 3 groups based on that. 
0 degree angled words (0)
obtuse angled words (2)
acute angled words (1)
Then followed 0 0 2 1 2 1 2 1  (x3) for 24 words.
Didn't help :)
@_date: 2018-05-21 11:22:40
True. End is actually white, but yeah, I went with what was there. Good eye.
@_date: 2018-05-20 18:38:18
assuming 24 in 12 pairs
@_date: 2018-05-19 20:12:11
I saw that. Lol
@_date: 2018-05-23 20:06:32
what is this garbage? I wouldn't pay you two doge for that.
It's 12 pairs, 24 words. The 24 in there AND 25, because it was originally 25 words, now it's "-1" back to 24. You're three days behind and a dollar short.
@_date: 2018-05-20 20:15:55
I assumed those three clues were freebies. Then looked for common pattern. Lines through numbers 1, 2, 9. See image for rest.
@_date: 2018-05-20 23:09:05
I did similar, but divide the words into two separate groups - those inside the white, and those orange. Numbers 3, 5, 10, 12 are in the orange so I assumed they correspond with words that are also in orange.
@_date: 2018-05-27 11:15:53
There are 12 numbers in the puzzle - 1-12, plus the numbers 24 and 25. 12 "think in pairs" = 24 "try +1"=25, then "-1" so back to 24. I'll bet you all 1 btc there are 24 words to this seed.
@_date: 2018-05-22 21:35:02
I just think that refers to 12 pairs = 24. It's going to be logical pairs that describe btc, the tech, the process of sending, verifying, network, speed of money, etc. into a story.
define paper provide need solve cash attack power solve problem post online grow network trust proof open code blah blah 12 pairs that tell satoshi's story. Maybe. Who knows. I've opened 10 empty wallets today :)

The value of solving this mnemonic has dropped $1200 since posted. OP, add a clue or one more BTC to make it worth our time.

If he removed it, does it still count?
@_date: 2018-05-23 12:57:11
it obviously refers to looking within the circle for the correct words.
That would make it significantly easier.
In a sense, there is no such thing as "beyond infinity", since infinity can't be reached. In geometry however, if you go "beyond" infinity, you start coming back to your starting point from the opposite direction. Just like crossing the half-way point of a circle!
@_date: 2018-05-24 12:02:21
These people sell greeting cards. There is no elliptical curve or finite field. 
Clue three - code easily, attack early is simply validating the second clue "think in pairs". There are 12 numbers plus the numbers 24 and 25. 12 pairs of words +1. Then they eliminated the 25th word hence "-1". 
You've really over thought the thing.
Nobody's donating to you.
@_date: 2018-05-23 11:03:11
wasn't bragging. each 24 word phrase that opened 10 wallets for me were stories, 12 pairs forming a coherent story about bitcoin. Can't brute force language with a machine to tell a great story.
@_date: 2018-05-20 22:26:38
Ahh, I see it. It could be that the words corresponding to 10 are also in the BTC orange - the words highlighted in blue. 
@_date: 2018-05-22 15:58:32
at this point it will either be completely great or suck horribly and make zero sense.
