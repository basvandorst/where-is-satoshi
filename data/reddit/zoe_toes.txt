As long as the bitcoin community is happy being a store of value is gonna be a bubble. The only way to consolidate the value is if the endgame is met, and it might not happen if other coins have better technology and usability. Right now we are safe because we were the first coin, and all the regular people are only aware of bitcoin and not the others. But everything dies eventually when  something superior comes along. I thought messenger was gonna be forever, fotolog, etc.  Who could possibly beat skype too right?

Don't use bitcoin to transfer to the other exchange, but ethereum.

But how do you use another coin from a bitcoin wallet.

Untill i fully understeand the benefits of a decentralized type of currency.  I rather have my 0 transfer fee, 1 second transfer speed banking account. The only thing that im aware of is that it can be used for ilegal stuff, tax evasion, etc since its not regulated. And i don't see how that's good. 
I have some bitcoin tho, but right now im just daytrading triying to come out ahead by some decimals in my respective market. Initially i just wanted to buy ADA, but these goddamn transfer fees from place to place don't make it worth.

cash is truer to Satoshi. And for those who say bitcoin is store of value, just a few days ago Andreas posted a video saying that the coins hold no value if they are not usable.
No one is to say wich one is bitcoin, only the market will tell with time, this is about decentralization and you want to control it.

just the other day cash had even more volume.

I don't know much about them U S A's, but in my country we have a free bank account for every citizen, only costing like 45 cents to withdraw from atm.  It's only "drawback" is the lack of prestige when paying with those cards because is the "peoples bank" and w/e.

Even then  it might still be terrible, as far as i understeand LN  is like a prepaid chanell, but who is going to pay whatever it is that it cost by that time to refill his prepaid bitcoincard ? only rich people. 
no college student would be able to afford bitcoin.
