You could certainly do that manually, we are offering convenience as most users do not know how to manually create an OP_RETURN transaction. We also provide a nice PDF at the end with all the relevant details.

Here's an example of a PDF generated client side using Javascript:  The "Hello World" is a message input by the user, we recommend inputting a signed message with the address used to pay.
In regards to the .exe you can scan it on virustotal or run it in a sandbox if you would like, I will look into publishing the visual studio project on github though. 
Thanks for the feedback.

Yes, fair points. As I said I will look into posting the project on git hub. 
This link should work:

4 mBTC is 0.004 BTC which is $1.20 at the current price, I don't think this is very expensive, and we also pay 50% more than the recommended fee to miners to help support the network.
Our biggest competitor charges 5mBTC.

We went for SHA3 as it is most likely future proof, it is the winner of the NIST hash function competition and the SHA-3 standard was released by NIST on August 5, 2015.
SHA3 is also not susceptible to length extension attacks which other algorithms including SHA2 are.
