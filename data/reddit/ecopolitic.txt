It's free market dynamics. Buy USD if you want controlled BS currency. OR BCH for that matter. Actually BCH is shit don't buy it. THEY HAD BUGS IN THE FORK. WTF else do you need to know smh

Stfu you shill. Maybe explain to them yon don’t need to spend 60k to get in and educate them on the shitty dev of BCH and the massive security risk they’ve created. Your IRL friends need a better friend.
