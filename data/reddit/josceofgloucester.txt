@_date: 2019-12-08 22:46:38
Great question.

Why would it be, as it stands its easier and cheaper(taking time and education into account) to use western union.

Are african union troops using bitcoin/dash/eth to send remittances home?
No they are using western union still.
@_date: 2018-03-01 12:43:47
Africa union troops there are still using western union.

^ Your brain on lolbertarianism. People overdose all the time from this "livable addiction" that in fact steals your soul. Ulbricht should have got the chair, cheaper for the taxpayer.
