Thanks Mandrik for notifying me, I've synced the local repository now, apologies for allowing this mistake to happen again.
If you look at the file package.sh  you will can see how the extension is deployed. Basically everything in the extension is just copied from the master repository at  and zipped together. I have added a git commit  &amp; push to the package script ( to prevent this happening again in future.

If you watch the progress dialog does the error appear on the first occurrence of "Waiting for participants" or at a later stage (i.e. is the error occurring on the first iteration)?

Shared Send is being depreciated. It is still active through the API for now but will likely be fully disabled within the next few days. 
Shared Coin is better from our perspective as no coins need to pass through Blockchain's control and it is therefore more in keeping with the way the client side wallet operates. Right now Shared Coin cannot provide "0% taint" however we have plans to remedy this in future. Shared coin is also free and fully open source, you can run your own server if you want to.

The issue was with how the transactions are sorted. The balance was being calculated with 9c8f1b918e6a6a2 being sorted before 46d529d722d1 (which is incorrect) despite them being ordered correctly in the json. Regardless it should be fixed now.

This commit is part of first in a series of planned updates to Shared Coin. We will be moving away from the concept of sequential iterations and the "correct" iterations will not longer be something the user is able to determine themselves.
Lots of updates coming after the holidays which will tie the changes together, at which time we will make a blog post explaining the changes that have been made and why its an improvement. Please sit tight until then.

In theory yes if you send from a single address and the input value is exactly equal to the output value then it is easy to establish a link. However in practice unless you are sending the exact balance of the wallet the shared coin client can deliberately use more inputs than necessary ensuring the input value is always different. When you don't know the exact input amount deducing the correct inputs after several iterations is extremely difficult.
Multiple outputs is certainly something we can add though.
@_date: 2014-03-12 13:18:46


Can you link the transaction. Your probably looking at the shared coin transaction that failed. Try pressing the "Recover intermediate addresses" below the shared coin send form.

I'm not sure at the moment, probably a few weeks. 
Don't think of it as a blow to privacy. With Shared coin even though the privacy provided may not be as strong for individual transactions it can provide free privacy for a larger number of users.
If the transaction is 2 months old it is unlikely we will be able to help. But you can try contacting support at

Looks like the transaction had a null previous txIndex which is incorrect because it's not a coinbase. It would show as a double spend because the "null" txIndex has already been spend by all other coinbase transactions. It's difficult to explain.

If a situation like this did occur the coins would be distributed in very small amounts (&lt; 1 BTC) gradually. Each anonymous transaction might end up 0.1 % tainted by the known coins but the final distribution would be too large for exchanges to blacklist. 
Whether this would be efficient for very large amounts I do not know because that bridge is yet to be crossed.

Taint is the term blockchain.info is using to describe the origin of funds funds received into an address. All coins are tainted in some way and It is not necessarily a bad thing. 
If someone sends you funds they have "tainted" your wallet. The vast majority of the time this won't be an issue. But there are two cases where it might be:
If you re-use addresses in a wallet it is likely each address will taint each other. This is not necessarily a bad thing but it makes it easier for anyone inclined to spot relationships between your spends. 
If your funds are "tainted" by a large quantity of known stolen coins exchanges may refuse to handle or even seize the funds when deposited. In my opinion it is wrong for exchange to police the network in this way as there will always be a way for those in the know to launder coins and it will be the novice users who end up being affected.
@_date: 2012-04-13 12:17:02
Removed the transaction from blockchain.info's database. So when using the web wallet client the transaction will no longer appear. This is automatically done after 24 hours with no confirmations but in this case I removed it manually.

THe number of clients wouldn't really have an effect on the likelyhood of your transaction being "wiped out". Really it only matters if the mining power e.g. the major pools split, you could monitor this quite simple by collecting a list of the major pools ips and making sure your client is connected to the majority of them.

Intresting. I don't really understand why Mt.Gox would go through all this trouble for just a "routine" backup. Surely it is safer to just keep track of one private key rather than hundreds of different ones (especially during a crisis like this). Looks more like laundering to me.
@_date: 2011-06-12 11:24:01

I wouldn't say I was going for the "Paypal twin", I think the target market of the site is people that use liberty reseve, pecunix, moneybookers etc. Online transactions that cannot be made using PayPal or a credit card for whatever reason. 
I'm not sure I see the need for any large corporations, bitcoin has managed without so far. For the record I would welcome chargebacks into the protocol as It would help adoption significantly (as long as regular none refundable transactions were possible as well).

I don't know how bitcoin watch collects it's data but for  I assume the first ip to submit a block is therefore the blocks owner. I then cross reference that ip to a list of known ips of the major mining pools. For various reasons method won't be 100% accurate but anyway here is the data from the last 3 days.
Basically the ip's with no description I have been unable to identify and would fall in the other category. They maybe independent miners, other pools or botnets i don't know.

I don't think dark pools are quite as sinister as you say they are, but i do agree they significantly disadvantage small investors. Mt.Gox isn't going to change it, so if you want to protest, move to another exchange. Though, until one gets enough volume, prices are generally just dictated by Mt.Gox.
@_date: 2011-08-16 19:09:07
1) It is basically akin to the inflation rate, it's the "cost" to holders of miners producing new coins. If the market cap doesn't change for a year then 31% of your coins value goes to the miners. But not quite because transaction fees are also included. 
2) Umm, no i'm just calculating 50%. Yes this is wrong. If the network is 2TH/s and I add 2TH/s, giving a total of 4TH/s, then I control 50%. So it is actually 100% current hashing power required, what do you think?
Thanks for checking it out.
@_date: 2011-06-07 13:21:25
- Dark pools do exist in existing markets 
- As far as i'm aware dark poolers cannot see other dark poolers orders. So there would either need to be some kind of secret irc chatroom where the big players collude. Mt. Gox is the only one who can see all orders, so it's more likely that he would be the one taking advantage.
- Possible, but people would have to sell to the powerful investor first which would drive the price sky high and everyone would profit. After that people could move to "bitcoinz" instead. 
A quote from Mt'gox: "Well. the market would have dropped to about .05 without darkpools.". You kind of have to wonder why?
@_date: 2011-12-21 10:07:29
Glad you like the wallet. Being able to choose the change address is high on my priority list. Before being able to generate a new address for change I want to add an archive ability, so the receive money tab doesn't become too clustered with hundreds of addresses. 
@_date: 2011-08-15 14:56:48
If just a few miners processed all transactions and collected all fees they would operate on a huge profit margin. Do you not think others will see this and want a share? More and more miners join until the profit margins are minimal. More miners = increased difficulty = more processing power = more electricity usage. Simples.
There is a minimum 0.0005 BTC fee for low priority transactions hardcoded into the client at present. The fee maybe set by the person sending however miners can refuse to process a transaction with no fees, making that transaction slower. See thread above for more discussion how miners could inflate the fees.
@_date: 2011-12-14 16:12:48
As I explained to Elsass you can add bitcoin addresses without adding the private key. The idea is that you can check your balance, transactions etc with just the public key. 
Then when you want to make a transactions you disconnect your internet, type in the private keys by hand or using a qr code (from a paper wallet backup) and sign the transaction. Then close the page and submit the transaction to a relay server e.g.  or 
Unless you packet sniff everything there is no way to be sure what a BCCAPI client might be sending to and from the server.

Because if there are higher fees there is more money available for miners to earn, which causes more miners to join looking for a share. I'm sure how to explain it any clearer.


Yes they do, all transactions can elect to have a fee attached and that is visible to the miners, it they solve a block with that transaction in it they collect the fee.

Dark pools can be filled all or partially by normal orders.  For example there could be a hidden 20,000BTC sell order sitting just below market price which gives the impression there is less supply than there actually is (or the opposite with a buy order).

@_date: 2011-09-29 17:37:04
Please help me understand open transactions. Is it p2p or does it require centralised open transaction servers?
If it is p2p then how does it solve the problem of some creating two transactions which spend the same balance then submitting it to two different servers. How is the conflict resolved? who has the correct transaction?
If it is not p2p then I assume you would send currency to a particular open transaction server which you would then have an "account" with. Even if i have a triple signed receipt how do i know the money is actually there whats to stop them just up and running with the money?
This is a genuine question not trying to flame.
@_date: 2011-08-15 15:48:51
Really it is the pool operators who decide whether or not to accept a particular transaction. Right now, if your try and send 1 BTC with 0 fees from a new address to another address it will not be processed by any major pools. You'd have to re-program your bitcoin client, pool operators can change these rules in their pool software.
* Do you accept that miners earn money from transaction fees?
* Do you accept that they have a motive to want higher transaction fees?
* Do you accept that they can possibly influence senders to pay higher transaction fees by refusing to process a transaction?
* Do you accept that mining being very profitable attracts more miners, increasing the difficulty?
* Do you accept the following. increased difficulty = more processing power = more electricity consumption?
Then that is my point transaction fees == increased electricity consumption.

Partially Yes, similar to strongcoin the wallet is javascript based so encryption and decryption are done client side, the keys are never seen by the server. Really it is just a javascript app which interacts with the api at  
You can browse the javascript code here 
Alternatively you can add a bitcoin address without adding the private key. Then if you try and make a transaction the instructions will show you how to generate the transaction offline and submit it to

Thanks for the suggestion. I have some ground work done implementing this feature already. However most double spend attacks involve the miner injecting a malicious transaction straight into their own block so it would never show in the unconfirmed list. I'll will be creating a JSON api at some point to allow merchants access to this info.

The efficiency of the hardware doesn't effect the overall energy consumption. If ASICs were 10x cheaper to run miners would be be able to afford to run 10x as many.
Same with the price of electricity, if it's cheaper then miners would just use double. This of course driver up prices for everyone. Good point about driving innovation, but it's something which hasn't happened yet.

Mt. Gox collects fees from both parties in a trade, so at least 0.65% of all bitcoins traded = 65-100 BTC / day. Not a massive amount, but still if the opportunity is their to game the system the temptation must be great. I guess thats why real currency exchanges are regulated so tightly.

At step 5 you remove the private keys so the JSON output you copy will look like this:
	"guid" : "34FGG3-2422-6c4c-772c-basada378b6b",
	"keys" : [
	{"addr" : "13uN6d3M75jKxqdpu1ZTm2VNhQRLahhYi4"},

hi, Ben from blockchain.info here. The server side code on blockchain.info isn't strictly open source, only the client side javascript code and apps are.
Some server code was available for review on a github until recently however it was out of date and wasn't really useful to anyone. Recent updates have made the code slightly more sensitive to public review, some constants and other private tokens need refactoring out before it can be made public.
I initially offered to share the updated source code with haeqon privately however due to his attitude in emails and the way he disclosed the first vulnerability he found (straight to reddit) I don't believe he would practice responsible disclosure and therefore was not given privileged access to blockchain.info's source code.

But you can't verify what code the server is really running.

Exactly, thats my point. With the client code you can verify that the server cannot steal your funds but you cannot know if the server is keeping logs. 
I'm telling you now the server is not keeping logs, but you can never verify this yourself even if the code is open source. This is why if you require strong anonymity when using mixing services you need to use multiple services from different providers.

Hi ragmondo, Ben from blockchain here. There isn't really anything we know about that transaction other than what you can see on the transaction page. 0.5 BTC was sent to 1Lvr7Gkx4jUJrfrKoJKh2ukoELH2AkWgvi and it was either made by a blockchain wallet user or submitted through our API.
1Lvr7Gkx4jUJrfrKoJKh2ukoELH2AkWgvi has been reused previously to receive other payments. I searched for it and all other addresses that have paid into it on google and for any mention in our support tickets there were no results.
Either way there is no way for us to verify who made the transaction. If he opens a ticket with his wallet information I might be able to look up the ip address that logged in last. Is the person sure they didn't send it somewhere accidentally? What device was he using (phone/pc)? Does anyone else have access to that device?

The "decoded" coinbase script on transaction pages was not being properly escaped. So theoretically you could mine a block with javascript in the coinbase and gain access to a users encrypted wallet, which in some cases may be stored in localstorage, and bruteforce it. 
For example satoshis message here:  could have contained javascript. Whether you could write any successful exploit in less than 100 characters (the maximum coinbase size) I don't know.

First let me say that the security issue posted was patched several weeks ago.
The decision to not to give the poster access to blockchain.info's server source code will not be altered. Ultimately users are entrusting us to keep their information private and secure and we therefore have to be extremely careful who we grant access to any material that could potentially cause harm to our users. Private source code has the potential for harm and while the poster may be a competent hacker I felt the vulnerability disclosure was not handled fairly to us and the communication timeframes were unreasonable. 
Having said that, the source code will likely be made public to everyone again soon. We are improving the ways security researchers can contact us and hope that any similar incidents can be avoided in future.

Yesterday a database error occurred at 5:07 PM it looks like your transaction was made almost at the same time and it is therefore possible the generated address did not make it into the most recent backup. Some MySQL devs are advising me on how to recover the missing data now.

The pairing code is purely client side and never sent over the network. 
authentication for the encrypted wallet blob requires the guid and shared key contained within the pairing code.
