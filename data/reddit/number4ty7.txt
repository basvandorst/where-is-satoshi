If you have to ask this question you should not be investing in anything.

This is reminiscent of the May day collapse in the silver market. To the moon baby!
So many going to get burned badly.

Short it?
@_date: 2017-05-25 03:16:26
I doubt that.

You understand you're buying the high?

How many other crypto currencies were there back then?

Hope you don't have too many savings.

You can live on btc? Where do you live? I can't tax or insure my car, pay my mortgage or buy food with btc and its highly unlikely I ever will. Can you even imagine the work involved for a supermarket to accept btc and alt coins? The risk they would be taking on exchange. New coins every week and others dissapearing. Never going to happen. 
And if transaction fees are high due to high transactions when less than 1% of people use them, how will it cope with the other 99%?
It's a fad. And a badly thought out one at that. Fair play to those who got in early and got here but they've made nothing if they don't get out before the inevitable demise.

I don't pay a fiver every time I go to the shop. Btc transactions are expensive. Also, btc will never replace fiat.

But nobody knows which sticks will feed their family on a daily basis. You can only do that so long until people start using something less variable.

New coins being created daily made everyone realise they have zero value. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 08:57:15
I mean new brands of coins, not debasement of btc.

Being a gold bug I just don't see the attraction. I know nothing will replace gold. No more will be minted and I can hold it in my hand without record. It's also been a store of wealth from forever.
Btc and the alts are just pure speculation on an untested idea with questionable value. It's asking to be burned unless you mined them years ago.
