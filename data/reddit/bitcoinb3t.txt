QR code is a good idea -- I just wonder how many people are going to be using it on mobile.. as well as making sure to not add anything in that might confuse them. 
@_date: 2014-08-30 04:58:41
Okay, thank you!
@_date: 2014-06-27 23:52:53
Did you receive a refund?
@_date: 2014-06-28 19:50:13
Exactly, you could do that. It's not a perfect system but if the betters know how it works it's pretty fair...
@_date: 2014-06-13 01:38:20
Any thoughts on the UI?
@_date: 2014-06-28 18:38:50
Got you!
@_date: 2014-06-24 17:33:38
Hey guys, betting has stopped currently -- we're still trying to diagnose some bugs :D
@_date: 2014-08-30 15:27:46
Best of luck on the fish ;)
@_date: 2014-06-28 18:40:09
Thank you! Appreciate it!
We sent you the btc
@_date: 2014-08-30 03:22:55
Thank you, really appreciate it!
@_date: 2014-06-28 19:48:31
We've filled up 10 people but I'll add you :D 
Make sure to bet quickly
@_date: 2014-08-30 02:51:44
Awesome, thanks for your help! Sent you the BTC.
@_date: 2014-06-28 20:11:48
The payout is proportional to how much you bet. Hopefully there's something lost in transaltion here. 
You couldn't make 10 bets of 1 satoshi -- because if there's another bet for any decent amount it would get 99.99% of the winnings... even if there are a bunch of small bets.
@_date: 2014-06-12 23:47:19
Thanks! Really appreciate it! 
@_date: 2014-06-28 20:47:28
If the game ends in a tie -- everyone who bet on 'tie' will be considered the winner. :P
@_date: 2014-08-30 03:23:16
Please use an exisiting reddit account.
@_date: 2014-08-30 03:17:51
Please use your main account, this is a brand new one :(
@_date: 2014-08-30 03:24:11
We will optimize for mobile, we're want to make sure the desktop works first before we do that though. It won't take us long.
Are you able to send a bet though?
@_date: 2014-06-28 18:35:56
Sent the bet :D
@_date: 2014-06-12 23:35:07
Would love any sort of feedback! 
@_date: 2014-06-28 19:47:47
That's valuable feedback -- we're going to add a piechart too which should hopefully clear up the transactions.
@_date: 2014-06-13 01:37:57
Awesome feedback -- we were already thinking of changing the domain
@_date: 2014-06-28 18:40:31
Sent it! Thank you!!
@_date: 2014-08-30 03:50:58
Sent you the btc - let me know how it goes :)
@_date: 2014-06-28 22:10:49
Yes about 60% didn't bet on anything -- oh well, that's the Internet for you!
@_date: 2014-06-02 20:51:20
Awesome, thank you! I'm going to try to implement this :)
@_date: 2014-08-30 03:07:49


Thank you juniorguy! 
@_date: 2014-06-24 17:27:50
@_date: 2014-08-30 07:31:40
@_date: 2014-08-30 03:02:18
Sent you the BTC! Thanks a ton in advance for your help :)
@_date: 2014-06-28 19:45:16
That's who a moderator is :P
@_date: 2014-06-24 17:22:48
Awesome! Can you let me know when you receive it :)
@_date: 2014-06-28 23:12:30
Thank you so much for helping test + your feedback!
We'll probably disable the chat for mobile (the chat service has that option built in anyway)
@_date: 2014-08-30 04:55:30
Very much appreciated tamnoswal!
@_date: 2014-08-30 03:50:35
I sent you some -- just wanting to make sure they aren't hoarded.
@_date: 2014-08-30 03:07:10
You should recive it shortly, thank you in advance!
@_date: 2014-06-27 23:52:32
hey Thomas did you receive a refund?
@_date: 2014-06-24 17:27:56
@_date: 2014-08-30 06:06:37
We'll be heading to bed for the night.. WIll check before 8:00 am tomorrow!
Thank you all who helped. 2 People so far out of 10. (WIll update)
@_date: 2014-06-28 19:49:38
Ohh that's something we don't control. But those are icons for other chatrooms. One is for the entire domain (jurybet.com) the other is specific to that page... so the actual bet.
@_date: 2014-06-28 18:41:32
Sent it to you!! 
@_date: 2014-06-19 15:43:30
Thanks! We have an update coming hopefully friday.
The integration with games will be w/ a desktop app however -- it's a little while aways.
@_date: 2014-06-28 19:41:26
Ahh I think we need to do a better job of explaining how the payouts work. Essentially you split the winnings with everyone else who voted on the winnings choice. 
@_date: 2014-08-30 04:40:44


@_date: 2014-06-02 19:30:20
Well that's a decent point but really lets assume that we don't care about the USD value during the auction... what I want to know is how to make this possible in a 'trustless' way
@_date: 2014-08-30 04:35:32
If you've made a bet - thanks!
@_date: 2014-06-28 22:55:40
Looking into the specifics right now -- will get back to you. It's probable that it's due to the transaction fee of .0005
@_date: 2014-08-30 03:28:49
Hey, I went ahead and sent you $2 worth of BTC. 
@_date: 2014-08-30 05:00:39
Thank you, piraga007.
@_date: 2014-06-28 19:42:01
Probably within the week. We'll just be doing as much UI cleanup as possible assuming all the payout stuff works perfectly. 
@_date: 2014-08-30 03:24:46
Still don't see a bet placed though :(
@_date: 2014-06-24 17:32:24


Sent it!
@_date: 2014-08-30 02:55:46
Please let us know if you have any feedback :)
@_date: 2014-06-19 14:45:05
We're trying to work on something to achieve this. Right now it's not as streamlined as it will be for videogames. The site is bitcoinb3t.com but is going to change soon.
Right now it's not integrated into videogames but it will be!
@_date: 2014-06-28 18:43:38
Betters WILL keep their winnings. This is your money now. Just hopefully help us with any feedback ;)
And actually use the money for the bet.
@_date: 2014-08-30 04:34:41
Woot thanks! ;)
@_date: 2014-06-28 22:10:04
If you could make your own custom bet - and send it there... I'll bet with you on it :D 
@_date: 2014-06-28 01:42:09
okay cool - thank you!
@_date: 2014-08-30 04:34:22
Okay, thank you. I completley understand the need for mobile. That would be 1st up to bat once we get people using the service on desktop.
@_date: 2014-08-30 15:27:31
Hey, I'll make sure to send you BTC when we start up the next bet!
@_date: 2014-08-30 03:15:09
Hey man, looks like you just made that account. Please use one that's more active. We're on a shoestring budget and I'm assuming you're just going to keep yours.
@_date: 2014-06-24 17:32:04
@_date: 2014-06-28 20:48:26
Yes the calculations are wrong -- thanks so much! Going to fix those after the bet is over :D
@_date: 2014-08-30 03:09:30
The customer service section will be up tomororw. If you have any issues please contact us here or at bitcoinb3t
@_date: 2014-06-27 23:53:38
Did you receive a refund?
@_date: 2014-06-28 18:37:10
Sent it mrpoponi!
@_date: 2014-06-24 21:13:30
Love your username! Your bitcoins will be sent back in a couple hours :P
@_date: 2014-06-24 17:31:50
@_date: 2014-06-28 19:53:48
Yeah you're right -- I think it also makes it looks more professional.
@_date: 2014-06-27 23:53:26
Did you receive a refund?
@_date: 2014-06-25 04:17:45
Hey guys, update time.
We discovered that part of the issue was some of our code was still pointing to testnet -- we're fixing that and doing more testing before we relaunch. 
Everyone's bitcoins are going to be refunded. We'll hopefully have everything back up soon and really appreciate your help in testing. We'll probably have some sort of 'hall of fame' at some point and everyone who helped today will be included!
@_date: 2014-06-28 18:37:00
Sent it!
@_date: 2014-08-30 03:08:20
@_date: 2014-06-24 21:10:50
We are probably going to have it fixed in about ~3 hours. All the bitcoins bet on the match will be given back to everyone who got them for free. 
This was to test our site and unfortunately (or fortunately) we found a show stopping bug.
@_date: 2014-08-30 03:50:46
Aweomse -- super stoked you like it!
@_date: 2014-08-30 15:26:50
I will send you BTC for the next bet! Will keep you posted.
@_date: 2014-06-28 19:43:41
That helps a ton -- probably more so than you realize!
I did use the clock to make it seem like we we're searching for you bet.. and to almost make you think "time is of the essense" but really the goal there should be to help the user know what step of the process is happening and make them feel secure.
@_date: 2014-06-28 19:45:28
Super helpful - going to clean the FAQ up
@_date: 2014-06-02 19:35:24
Right but the key here is that all the other bids need to become invalid.
@_date: 2014-06-28 21:05:00
Oh I didn't know that... I guess neither did the people that voted on tie :P
@_date: 2014-08-30 15:27:04
Thank you, we do too!
@_date: 2014-06-27 23:53:50
Did you receive a refund?
@_date: 2014-06-28 18:40:42
Thanks -- sent it your way!
@_date: 2014-06-28 22:02:07
I see what we should have done (and will do next time) is something along the lines of:
1. Uruguay Victory
2. Colombia Victory
3. Uruguay Shootout Victory
4. Colombia Shootout Victory
@_date: 2014-08-30 15:26:28
You just click on bet, and put in your public btc address. Then we generate an address for you to send your bet to!
@_date: 2014-06-24 17:31:30
Sent :D
@_date: 2014-08-30 15:25:52
I'll send you BTC when we do the next bet!
@_date: 2014-06-28 23:22:03
Hi dskloet -- it is indeed the .0005 fees that are subtracted from the winning payouts to cover transaction fees and Jurors payouts. 
We should include all payouts in one transacation as you suggested. We just wanted to get something up and running but it shouldn't be too hard to put together that custom transaction. 
@_date: 2014-06-28 20:17:23
Yes that's 3rd party. We can customize certain aspects about it though so any feedback on that is greatly appreciated!
