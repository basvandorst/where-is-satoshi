That's what they wanted - slippage. The more the better. At one point the price went from 12 to 1. They wanted to move price so they can make profit on another account. Of course there was a huge loss on the original account. But they are thieves, they don't care.

There was indeed a big spike on LTC/CNH (CNH - offshore yuan) on BTC-E last weekend. CNH markets are pretty thin on BTC-E. So the thieves apparently bought themselves some CNH, then inflated CNH with this stolen money and eventually cached their CNH for BTC or LTC.
