If you go to the beginner's subreddit you see a lot of people asking for help to buy bitcoin so that they can pay ransoms to malware authors. These people don't care about bitcoin, are not interested in trading it and do not want to jump through hoops to get verified on exchanges. They just want some bitcoin quickly so they can pay the ransom and get their files back. localbtc is ideal for them.

1. unique wallet id
2. Addresses in 1 from which you have received your compensation fees
3. IP address of the computer with the wallet. You can use a geoip database to find out the user's location.
4. Dates and times when the user is online.
These are just some of the things that your server can determine. You probably don't care about the above but there will be other actors who are interested in this information and having it all in one place makes their job easier.

You are wrong about the OVH dedicated server prices. You can get far cheaper servers at OVH france and far cheaper servers at other US hosting companies.

So you can have a fractional reserve system with bitcoin as well. Satisfied. Most of the bitcoin exchanges are running a fractional reserve. They would be stupid not to because they would be leaving money on the table.

You can do this with bit2factor.org . It doesn't use multisig. It uses BIP38 encrypted private keys. But it works like you said in that both the seller and buyer have to cooperate to allow the seller to withdraw the bitcoins to an address he has sole control over.
The problem with this sort of system is that the buyer can demand extra money after he has gotten the goods. At that point he has power over the seller and the seller will get nothing unless the buyer cooperates to release the bitcoins.
You can also look into bitrated.com where multisig is used and a  arbitrator is a party to the transaction and can help resolve disputes.

The very first miners did use bitcoin core. It has a generate coins option. But it will use your CPU for mining and that is very inefficient. These days mining is done using specialized devices called ASICs and in specialized buildings called data centers. An example from China:
You could try mining from home by buying an ASIC or two. Do the math beforehand to make sure you have a good chance of turning a profit.
edit: you can run bitcoin core on testnet with the generate coins option enabled and it will give you testnet bitcoins. Difficulty there is permanently set to 1 for quick coin generation. testnet coins have no monetary value.

Open a greenaddress.it wallet. They allow you to encrypt the mnemonic with a password to produce another 24 word mnemonic but this one requires the password to decrypt. So you can note down the encrypted mnemonic and keep the password in your head.

That seems excessive for a correspondent bank to take. Intermediary or correspondent banks do take a cut. It can be arbitrary and the sender won't have any say in it. But $900?!

The latest version has blockchain pruning so you should only need a gig or two. It will still download the entire blockchain to verify it but then delete most of it.

How would you know? You don't go asking your users why they buying or selling bitcoins.

He's referring to new blocks. 
Headers first doesn't make much difference for an electrum server because it has to have the full blockchain before it can do its job anyway.

It's going to keep declining because miners have found new efficiencies:


The high rate of monetary supply inflation is another factor.

The Chinese [have already]( rejected Gavin's idea. They have the largest exchanges and the biggest mining pools. They make all the mining hardware. What you've posted above is just FUD.
@_date: 2015-06-08 21:16:28
That's just ridiculous. There are Chinese bitcoin users. If one of them happens to stumble by here it doesn't mean it's a big conspiracy.
@_date: 2015-06-08 20:23:39
Disk space is cheap. The bigger problem is downloading 30GB of blockchain data. The most frequent complaint voiced by new bitcoin core users is that it's taking forever to sync. Invariably people tell them to use an SPV client instead.

I meant the volatility.
@_date: 2015-06-09 18:50:05
Because software development costs time and effort and the developers would like to be compensated for that.
This actually isn't even the biggest problem. The biggest problem is that your wallet is no longer anonymous. Their server tracks wallets for accounting purposes. It's called BRIT and is a system they developed. There should have been an outcry over *that* but no one cares.
@_date: 2015-06-08 13:30:28


It's rarely as simple as that and you know it. You have to verify yourself with the exchange and that will involve sending company docs to the exchange. It will take time and be a hassle. Individual accounts are actually easier to verify compared to company accounts. 
Then there is the exchange rate volatility. It's going to end up costing them more than if they just took a wire.

It's a really difficult question to answer because you haven't explained what technologies business are going to add. Every technology is different and there is no way to know whether it'll be easier to add to ripple than bitcoin.


Agile? chameleon? Can't you use clearer language? If by agile you mean flexible then ripple is run by one company and they have more power over the ripple network than anyone in bitcoin. So if they choose to they can help you out.

Nope. You made that up. Their internet is not shitty either. FYI the largest ecommerce site in the world is Chinese. It's called alibaba and it's bigger than Ebay and Amazon combined. And that's just one company. They have one of the largest social network sites in the world too. It's called qq.com. Their internet sector is very well developed.

You can also use various open source libraries to generate addresses from a bip32 extended pub key. If you tell me your language of choice I'll point out any projects I know of.

Who said anything about fractional reserve? You can have debt without fractional reserve. Soon as you keep your bitcoin with some else that becomes a debt they owe you.

It's *prevented* them from occurring.

They are waiting for the price to bottom out. 
Some can't buy because there aren't enough regulated marketplaces that sell it. 
The speculators will not buy because they are not interested in buying low. They want to buy high and sell higher i.e. buy when the price is rising.
They don't believe it is the future of money. It is still too hard to use and consumer adoption just hasn't happened.
There are technical problems too and I'm not talking max block size. The number of full nodes keeps falling and that's a very bad sign. Coin validation types are building databases of address -&gt; real world identity mappings. Soon they might start blacklisting some addresses and that will kill fungibility.

You just increase the gap limit again in future if you happen to restore from seed. Simples. Or just remember to ask for help and people will remind you.

No. Those are obsolete. These days ASIC speeds are measured in TH/s
MH/s - million hashes/second
GH/s - billion hashes/second
TH/s - Trillion hashes/second
Visit the [group buy section of bitcointalk forum]( to see what's the latest. This is the place where you get the cheapest prices but beware of scammers. Look at people's trust ratings before you do business with them. See feedback left by other users. Do your research before buying. Don't jump into quickly or you'll lose money.

The blockchain has gotten too big and it's no longer feasible to download it on a residential connection. It takes too long. 20MB blocks would be madness!
@_date: 2015-06-07 14:04:15


Because it is more convenient? It's already being done by the thousands of merchants who use payment processors like bitpay and are willing to retain part of their earnings in bitcoin. Then there are people who trade on exchanges. The bitcoin balances there are debt. Anywhere you have off-chain transactions you have debt. Changetip and localbitcoins are other examples.
@_date: 2015-06-08 13:31:46


No. Only racists are worried about that.

I know you released a lot of betas and that was the right thing to do. But IMO this is the first beta. People don't want to risk their bitcoins on beta wallets so this is the first version that will be tested in the wild with real money. Their bug reports and your bug fixes will make the wallet stable.

Creating the wallet is easy. You can do it with bitaddress.org.
Buying bitcoin is not easy. Your real question is how to do I buy $50 worth of bitcoin? It depends on where you live in the world. Since you haven't told us I'll assume it's in a developed country. You could try circle.com, localbitcoins or an exchange like bitstamp or coinbase. Exchanges are harder to get into.

Bitpay requires verification too. They start you off with a low limit. I think it's $100 per day. If you want to increase the limit you have to verify your company.

Try altcoin mining if you want to use a GPU. GPUs used for bitcoin mining haven't been profitable for well over a year now. As I said ASICs are where it's at as far as bitcoin mining goes.

Bitcoin doesn't make debt impossible. There was debt when commodity money was all people used. There was debt when fiat was backed by gold. 
There are limits to how much money banks can lend and that puts a cap on how much debt there can be.
