I'm sorry, but your cavalier attitude is exactly why people should be worried. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:27:47
No, man - someone just randomly gifted you $10,000! Quick, enter all of your personal info.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:44:25
Do not listen to these fucking people. Wait for it to hit about 210, and then sell. These people are too emotionally invested to realize that this is all just one big game and you already won.

Buying virtual currency on debt... the greed is strong

"I guess I am too old for cars now. At some point you just realize they are recycling the same shapes."
No, it has nothing to do with age, it has to do with passion. I'm sure you have plenty of hobbies/money-sinks that other people can trivialize in the exact same way you just did. Think about it.

Why do people keep comparing Gold to Bitcoins?!? Do you have any education background in economics or finance? What the fuck! You people have completely lost any critical thinking skills in this Bitcoin-fever crap.
@_date: 2013-04-09 21:38:23
A fool and his money...
@_date: 2013-11-09 23:26:56
This is terrible advice and it's a shame it was upvoted to the top. You guys are allowed to have your idealistic views but giving people fundamentally incorrect advice is just.. shitty. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:57:11
I'd say it's actually pretty simple, but it will get much better as time goes on. You can bet on it :)
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:20:35
Exactly what I was thinking as I was reading this. The problem with a website like this is if you have thousands of these loons all together backing each other up they just keep further cementing this crazy stuff in their heads.
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:43:36
In a (very, very distant) way, I'm related to all of you. Spread the wealth, comrades.
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:44:44
Huh? Who said anything about predicting one with the other? He posted this as a "warning" - meaning that it can happen to a corporation, and it is all the more likely to happen to an unregulated virtual currency with no backing. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:34:42
I don't think we'll **ever** be in a situation where every single government on the planet has banned Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:29:08
I love that the majority of the responses to this will be:
a.) Fuck you troll
b.) Bullshit, just wait!
You are oh so right, though.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:53:12
How the hell are you downvoted? People here have LOST IT
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:38:54
The reason that story caught so much fire was because it's easily relate-able for people who are smacking themselves on the forehead right now for not buying in on Bitcoins earlier. It makes all the people who are saying "Why didn't I buy bitcoins when they were $0.60!!" say "HAHA, WELL AT LEAST I'M NOT A SUCKER LIKE *THAT* GUY. (who has probably still made millions off of bitcoins considering he had 10k of them 2 years ago)"
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:06:56
Exactly. And to be perfectly honest, i'm just disappointed I don't have the capital/connections to manipulate something at such a large scale. Truly impressive. Terrifying, but impressive.
@_date: 2013-04-09 21:35:47
...lol. If only we ALL knew this, eh?
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:41:17
And so it begins. Congrats on being the first of many blogs to pick up on this story.
@_date: 2013-11-10 00:01:22
Please ban the ever-living shit out of this guy. Exploiting a crisis, excellent work!
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:32:39
I'll keep saying this again and again. As hard as it is to swallow, this isn't a great political movement. Like any other exchange, this is a game. And most of you are getting played.
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:19:00
Had no idea what you were talking about so I went to his username page. **Holy fucking shit.** That guy is the real deal. HUGE respect to him.
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:38:55
The OP is allowed to... corporation versus virtual currency FAVORS the "Bitcoin is going to tumble" argument. 
@_date: 2013-11-04 00:26:17
@_date: 2013-04-09 22:26:32
I've started reading this subreddit as of today and all it has done is further justify my perspective on this whole Bitcoin situation. You're suggesting something that any rational, intelligent investor would do, but you're mostly going to be met with "No way man, sticking with these little babies all the way to 1mil per BTC!!!!!!!!!!!!"
I saw someone earlier get called a neo-nazi for suggesting the price surge is making it more volatile...
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:40:25
Man, you know absolutely nothing about economics. :/ I honestly just pity how cocksure you are about this. What you need to realize is this whole currency exchange game isn't about what you *feel* and what you *think* is going to happen. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:54:34
Given that by the time this happens, Bitcoin loyalists will have created Bittopia, a wonderful country where statues of Bitcoins are erected on every street-corner.... no, this will not be an issue for the Bitcoin economy at all.

edit: in the time you took compiling this submission, btc dropped 300+
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:29:17
As I'm telling other people, I strongly urge you to seek out neutral investment advice by people who aren't involved in the Bitcoin phenomenon. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:34:31
Did you just compare a corporation that produces consumer goods to a virtual currency?
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:21:42
Congrats on that first cashout, LOL at the rest.
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:32:04
I am so sorry that you were too romanticized with the idea of what Bitcoin is to turn it into a smart investment. Instead, 6 months from now you'll be reflecting on your poor decision.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:42:54
So you bought Bitcoin when it was at its highest hype and speculation? Makes sense. You have no one to be mad at but yourself.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:27:12
Considering bitcoin is crashing as we speak... isn't there a more opportune time to post something like this?
@_date: 2013-04-10 06:35:26
From what I have heard, they have been honoring refunds this far. Key phrase being "from what I've heard." It is worth a shot regardless.
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:16:51
Wait a second. Are you guys seriously STILL ordering from them? What the fuck? One of the co-owners has been charged for scamming people before, and they haven't shipped a SINGLE order yet. CANCEL YOUR ORDER.
@_date: 2013-04-10 07:05:05
People are literally stalking your account waiting for your next post. This is impressive.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:33:27
The market will go crash further because of all the people who log in and panic-sell to try and get whatever value out of their Bitcoins that they can.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:57:49
Lucky? Or just smart? 
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:27:33
Just you wait, man. This is just temporary. Each bitcoin will be worth 100k/1million soon enough. I'm just biding my time and trying to avoid the thought that maybe, just maybe, I made a dumb decision not to sell and instead grow overly passionate about **VIRTUAL CURRENCY.**
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:09:22
Serious question. Do you HONESTLY believe bitcoin is going to go that high EVER? What evidence/facts/anything do you have to back that up aside from an idealistic hunch?
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:42:32
Okay, as long as you admit it's an idealistic hunch I have zero issues with you, at least you're being honest with yourself.
