Very good post.
@_date: 2018-01-05 14:06:27
Does anyone know how the price of altcoin/bitcoin pares are calculated by coinmarketcap? For example the TRX/BTC is showing over 19k right now.
@_date: 2018-01-04 06:55:44
Simple, how do you make sure your hard earned money does not decrease in value? 
If any entity can control your money, they can either do "Quantitative Easing" which gradually rip 2%~15% yearly from you, like the government do, or worse, like a mob natured company will do, just flip a switch and shut you out.
A crypto currency needs to be truly decentralized without any single point of failure, to be able to provide you that promise, that your money truly belongs to you, and nobody can touch that, nobody can create money out of thin air.

Bitcoin is not the bubble, it's the pin.
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:24:14
That would be easier to answer. I think the biggest hurdle is, will you hold even if it drops 40% in a few days? Yes I will!

Coinbase is constantly displaying "Partially Degraded Service

Hanging on, it’s actually very good for bitcoin to have some much needed time
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:55:30
So do you work for Coinbase? Or you are with Bcash?
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:09:30
Yes, I think it might just happen, not because the market need it, but because Coinbase like exchanges are controlling the market.
But they can’t turn a pile of shit into something of value. Not gonna happen, sorry.
Coinbase will cease to be relevant.

The "why" behind bitcoin and altcoins are fundamentally different. Go have yourself educated online, if you really want to know why. 
Otherwise please stop pretending and wasting your own life.

Excellent post. I’m 100% with you 
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:35:09
The market is clearly manipulated on GDAX, bots were sending tiny orders that drove down the price.

Yes, sadly. Distributed ledger technology alone is meaningless, so sad so many people interested in crypto currency can’t get it right. There’s a lot of bad actors feeding people these wrong ideas too.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:27:11
Alright, sign up for another exchange before you buy anything.

I just hope they are not canceling it again.

@_date: 2017-12-21 03:28:22
I agree most of your point. However it is absolutely critical to notice that only a few crypto is a real revolution while others are just money grab. If we can't distinguish those that support one with those that support another, it's more harmful than just being polite.

They did what they did for profit, if they don’t do it, there’s plenty of others will do it.  People hate them for a reason, and you don’t get to say things if you can’t prove otherwise.

Thanks, will check it out.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:01:40
I see your point. Perhaps it is still not a good time for those to buy in yet. Bitcoin is a little bit overextended, would be nice to grow quietly for a little longer. 
It’s also important to teach them the right rules for this game, however with so many people trying to undermine, it’s easy to get lost, this which may be the attacker’s secondary goal unfortunately.
However the overview is this, hold a day longer, there will be a better chance for bitcoin to win.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:18:54
You shouldn’t buy anything before educating yourself. Otherwise you are not helping anyone including yourself. 
A good place to start

Replacement of the current broken fiat and banking system, transferring power from centralized authority to individuals hand. Remove the boundary that holds the world back that benefit only those in power.Unleash the true potential of human kind. 
These are bitcoin’s value, and no copy cat can deliver this value with even a slight variation of its decentralized, open, censorship resistant nature. 
This is why 
Bitcoin = revolution 
BCash=trash &amp; evil.

@_date: 2017-12-21 12:34:22
I’m curious too, is it  common across the exchanges? I know GDAX supports API so you can make boys to trade, there’s also some open source bot that anyone can access.
But I just don’t know why people are constantly doing this, on both sides. Fucking annoying. Bots were used frequently to suppress bitcoin price, especially yesterday.

If you think BTC will become obsolete, dump it and buy Bcash then.
@_date: 2018-10-05 23:01:21
This is to be expected, one of the biggest threats bitcoin faces is that the state controls majority of the hash power to constantly mine empty blocks to stop every transaction.  And normal mining will be driven underground. Pooling is indeed something that will work against bitcoin.
For the bitcoin to succeed in the competition with the state, people must willingly take risks to protect bitcoin by covertly miming, pay higher fees, etc.
For those who are interested,this series of articles brilliantly explains the dynamics in different phases and challenges that bitcoin will face.
