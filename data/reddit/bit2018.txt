Omg thank you so much. I've been beating my head against the wall all day over this. Funny I'm an accountant too but they couldn't be more vague especially with Coinbases definition of a sale being a transaction which is done every time you transfer the coins. I'm just gonna write a check based on the 28 percent of the whole thing and get this whole thing out of my life. I'm in financial services I don't need the headache I'll stick to options and forex.

Ok I've bought about 5k worth over 3 years and used all of it for online gaming. Do I still owe and how much?
I just want to pay and be done with this entire thing. Never going near bitcoin again.

Not gonna lie I'm a little freaked out. I buy bitcoin to play games online but I have no way of tracking it. It's mostly been for black jack and dice but I lose all the time but find it entertaining. Ive been looking for lawyers and accountants all morning.

I have a question think you can help me out?

So wait what would I be paying taxes on. The coins I purchased or the ones I used. And what about the ones I used for online games or the ones I exchanged for doge to play online games. At this point I regret even hearing about bitcoin I just want to pay whatever I owe and discard of everything

Can I just pay them on that single transfer or is it perpetual until converted back to cash?
