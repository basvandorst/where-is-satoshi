"I want to see how this money making thing works could you send me money?"

yeah, we may see more and more of this unfortunately until bitcoins become less volatile.

You're right, hoarding is the better way to go...purchasing items with bitcoin is a poor way to go. Btw, whats ur address?..id just like to know where to send some lefty scissors and glue paste so you can play with them in the corner. :)

Volatility of any market is reactive to its utility and the speculative insight of its investors. We saw this even more when the bitcoin worth dropped from 1200 to 500 recently. Bullish investors turned bearish and cashed in their gains after the news from China. 
If there was enough actual utility behind bitcoin the price would have remained stable making silly speculation almost irrelevant. Unfortunately, the current bitcoin price is almost entirely driven up by bullish speculation. The true bitcoin worth, driven only by utility, is far lower than the current bitcoin value.
SO…everyone stop hoarding bitcoin and use it!!!!! Buy a pizza or something!!!!!
....or you may find yourself holding onto nothing at all :)
