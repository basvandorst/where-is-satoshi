Good job dude, it could have been so  easy to just steal it without anyone finding out it who did it. But instead you helped him out. A shining example of the Bitcoin community and it's users(or well, mods).

Why isn't Bitcoin triceratops real :(
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:12:36
Did a 4.2k btc transaction last month which cost 3$ and took 22 mins..so idk what you are talking about 
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:07:27
Not him, but I think it can reach and cross the price of 1 gold bar, which is currently 40k USD per bar(1kg). Since Bitcoin is being treated like gold right now, but is better than actual gold, it could easily reach 50k or higher.

It's "fly you fools". I bet you also say "I will come back" when you mention the Terminator! 
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:51:38
Yeah but all it takes is a few large places not using LN, since it's entirely optional. That would just clog up the Bitcoin network and if it happens on a large scale then Bitcoin could be clogged for weeks or forever.
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:13:41
Probably something like ripple

But eth only has 30kb blocks and is arguably more decentralised than Bitcoin.

Total global Bitcoin power consumption*.....try comparing the total global industrial power consumption of stuff like electric furnaces. It's a drop in the bucket.
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:35:49
Bitcoin consumption is nowhere close to industrial consumption that causes an increase in energy demand.

In addition to what everyone said (make a new addresses), make sure you do the trade in the parking lot of a police station.
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:40:18
Sure, but it's 85%
Secondly, coal plants don't "adjust" production every minute. They produce electricity and waste it anyway if it's not used. Which again, is a government problem, not a Bitcoin one. Those plants will exist regardless of Bitcoin and must be stopped.

As a freelancer? because fuck PayPal and western union for international transfers.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:28:36
Is it really? Germany is like fully renewables only. No coal and no bs. They can use as much electricity as much as they want.

It will be by the time people end up reading this thread. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:50:52
Testing. Plus companies like coinbase will actually have to implement it...which doesn't even support segwit yet.
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:06:58
Pointless if it isn't released as a generic med. Seems it's all just concept and marketing as well.
Can anyone correct me here? I really want this to be true. But I'm skeptical.

I don't think bcash is the solution, but dont LN transactions still need to be confirmed on the blockchain? Realistically, how many transactions are going to be made on LN only?
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:46:00
Fuck, you right, missed a zero there, it was 30$! Wtf.
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:43:58
Normally instantly fiat it, but sometimes I keep it if I don't need to use it. If I could use btc for purchases everywhere I'd just do that too. Some places offer Amazon vouchers to btc. So I guess it's somewhat usable.
@_date: 2018-05-23 12:34:38
They'll become like coinbase / a centralised wallet. Which will be necessary for business.
@_date: 2018-06-01 19:07:59
Not that guy, but Visa and Bitcoin are two different things.  Bitcoin is a currency, Visa only facilitates fund transfers. It's more like a Bitcoin node going down, since MasterCard, Rupay etc are still up.
@_date: 2017-11-07 09:14:19
Oh, I see.
@_date: 2017-11-23 15:06:34
What does it do? Hire someone to buy Bitcoin for you? Lol. Would make more sense if it was a cypto mutual fund in which experts selected and invested in cryptos which are about to boom
@_date: 2017-11-20 03:45:59
It only goes down 20% or so. What difference does it make anyway? It'll always come back up. At least since it's in the growth phase now. Buy it. Won't matter if you get it at 7k or 8k. Because when it's 16k, you are still at massive profits.
@_date: 2017-11-07 06:33:03
The attack can only work if you make a tx on the 2x chain. If you make a tx on the 2x chain that means you support it and not the original Bitcoin. So in that scenario it doesn't matter at all.
But I get it, some people like to claim alt coins and cash in. This could cause them to lose coins. So in some ways it could be considered hazardous.
The solution to this isn't technological, but rather information awareness. Someone more malicious could use replays to attack Bitcoin via some sort of pseudo phishing in the future. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 09:33:07
Apart from the usual power and control. I guess to help with thefts, stupid exchanges stealing money, consumer protection amongst a few.
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:49:23
Core never wanted 2x afaik. Only bitmain and company did.
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:44:04
For me it's not about the tech per se. It's about believing in a decentralised society over a centralised one.
@_date: 2017-11-03 12:19:22
Venezuela, Zimbabwe, KGB, CIA, money launderers, tech enthusiasts...all of these are using Bitcoin as a currency and medium of exchange.
@_date: 2017-11-07 07:10:26
Isn't mining banned in China? How are they doing it?
@_date: 2017-11-03 10:41:42
While it's true that it could crash, its not really a bubble. Its the growth phase of Bitcoin. A growth stock keeps on growing, then stops. I think Bitcoin would have a similar price chart.
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:07:20
Oh yeah my bad! I forgot that despite close association, 2x and bcash are two different things.
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:31:34
Good thing the memes on this subreddit do not determine the meme economy. It would crash in an instant.
Your beloved hodler
@_date: 2017-11-07 07:53:18
RBI doesn't legislate. They merely stated they won't be using crypto to settle their own transactions.
It won't be banned in parliament.
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:47:53
You could quite literally just store it in coinbase, which is easier than opening a bank account and coinbase can maybe start a card service with a pin. So it could still be in the form of regular debit and credit cards. 
That's if you add so many layers to make it more mainstream acceptable.
This is not very ideal in my opinion, but it's a way.

@_date: 2017-11-28 04:37:27
Actually, I love how it calls it a "tech upgrade". Bcash is not an upgrade, it's a downgrade.
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:37:54
Ya, I wonder why the scalpel factories don't perform surgeries themselves. Why do they sell it to doctors and hospitals when they can make a profit out of them?
Similarly, mining Bitcoin _does_ require some technical skills even if those seem easy for us. And we aren't the average Joe in terms of computer usage.
Second, do consider that Bitcoin is risky as hell, no investor wants that on their worry list.
@_date: 2018-11-07 17:15:53
It's in the "watch my ass" business. They don't want law enforcement crawling up them.
@_date: 2017-09-03 05:46:54
We probably will still need some places to discuss this. As users and miners run Bitcoin along with devs. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:54:12
Yep, but I'm not in it just for money. I'm in it because I'm investing in decentralisation. Bitcoins success is more important to me than my profits. I only invested what I was willing to lose.
And yeah, it'll make me a lot of money anyway, by December it should cross 5k.
@_date: 2017-10-13 05:50:08
If you sell its a loss. If you hodl you will truly gain.
Edit: you guys are retarded, this isn't a stock, this is a currency. Just use bitwage and a visa card till Bitcoin is more widely accepted as a default currency.
@_date: 2017-09-20 12:26:28
What happened with the recent forced hardfork?
@_date: 2017-09-21 05:20:34
My bad, it wasnt forced. It was a premature hardfork. I think 27 days earlier than intended.

I know it's not complete yet,but I know someone who is working on a decentralised market place called taskhive. Its still at a very early stage and plans to use bitmessage as a protocol.
If any are willing to help with the project in anyway possible,PM me.

That's true, but I think they concluded that while blockchains was innovative it did not drive "instant payments"..which is why they decided not to implement it. At least for now. Things may change with LN release.
@_date: 2017-10-26 19:23:50
If it's centralised, a database is more efficient. What's the point in making centralised blockchains? They are slower.
I'm genuinely curious if there's a benefit to centralised blockchains over database alternatives. It's easier and cheaper for visa to run its servers with their current database over switching to blockchains. 
And unlike fiat money, if crypto is stolen, its almost impossible to recover.
So the decentralisation vs centralistion aspect never was about the consumer as much as it was about it being beneficial at all.

You already have SWIFT, MT799 and other similar instruments for that.
Though the use of ripple for international settlements was nice. But ripple isn't entirely centralised.

Its different because you are printing _another_ currency. Like Disney dollars being printed when USD is main.

There's a reason why Satoshi was anonymous, because we should be able to manage without a few powerful humans controlling things. Satoshi didn't want to be in control of Bitcoin using his real persona.
Ver is grabbing that power vacuum and the system won't like it. He will get what he deserves for trying to "take control and centralise Bitcoin". Now he can fight the centralised powers in a centralised way.
