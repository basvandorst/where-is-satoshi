Coinbase tracks all transactons, based on their own lists of (good or bad ) addresses they can actually lock your abilities to buy or sell crypto on their site
This apply also if you buy ( for exaple) on coinbase then withdraw founds on your private cold wallet and then  send  founds elsewhere (bad addresses such casinos, dark web sites etc) to do something illegal

In a range between 14k~20k

Less reward  same cost, but if the demand of btc stay the same or will be more, then u will see a pump in the price compensating miner for their effort

Si, va bene, ma su coinbase ti fanno pagare un bel po' di fees e non ti conviene comprare poco alla volta, li ti conviene comprare a botte da 200 euro e si prendono 2.99€ ogni volta che lo fai
Su kraken invece puoi comprare un minimo di 0.002 btc e paghi solo 0.26% di fees su ogni acquisto( pagabili in euro) e 0.0005 ogni volta che muovi i bitcoin sul portafoglio

U should consider taking a loan to buy at least 100 btc right now to be rich in 10 years

A normal break down (resistence rejection)
It says that BTC is not ready to make a new time high, more time to accumulate
Always buy on spot, no leverage, every single day and you are ALLRIGHT

A good  thing will be if any suspect amount of btc, on exchanges will be frozen and later with every check sent back to the original owners getting involved in this absurd scam
@_date: 2019-08-02 14:21:57
10000 btc to buy one
@_date: 2019-08-19 00:47:25
Bello, apriti un account su kraken e comprato 0.002 btc al giorno senza stare a guardare al prezzo ogni volta che arrivi 0.05 prendi e scaricateli sul ledger

Make sure to buy around the 21 EMA on weekly (8900-9000) cz this will be our last  chance to see btc so cheap before the next major move
@_date: 2019-08-28 21:26:02
It was so obvious, we need this, we need a little bit more fear in the market, we need.to test the 21 EMA at 9k, maybe also a false break out towards 8.5k (and also fill the CME gap)...then when almost  everyone will be scared, bitcoin will raise again towards ATH...,(maybe jan-feb 2020)
@_date: 2019-05-09 21:38:13
Actually there is a huge resistence at 6400
We need a correction consolidating support at 5k where a lot of ppl will buy like no tomorrow pushing the price back to 6k+ for a second attempt
@_date: 2019-05-09 21:39:52
Precursor of a incoming correction
