I just created my first wallet today!  Trick or treat?

I've been making it rain at Youtube this month.  At least a couple dozen new acolytes to tipping have been born.  I quit watching comments to see what would happen unless someone messages me, but my changetip account keeps getting smaller!  I've come to the conclusion that when tipping to spread the message, quantity, quantity, quantity, is what matters.  People will do their own research about bitcoin when they are given free coins.   
Go and spread the wealth!

Please keep tracking, I started on the 3rd of November, so my sample is of a shorter period.

Awesome idea!  The two quickest ways I know to speed  adoption of a new product or idea are to incentivise its spread or to give it away for free.  This accomplishes both! 
I don't know if I'll be able to tip every day in November, or if I'll be able to give out a whole dollar ( I only have $2.85 so far ).  What I will pledge is to tip 10% of my bitcoins each day I am on Reddit in November.

Thanks!  How do i go about accepting it?

Just remember to tell those with this though process that crime has been perpetuated with every type of currency and payment system men have ever invented..................  Always has, always will.  Zero reason not to get behind bitcoin.

Thanks for sharing BitByTip!  I already shared to my Facebook to enlighten my acquaintances.  I hope to make it rain at youtube, I watch a lot of videos there and know a ton of creators that would totally embrace ChangeTip.  Keep up the good work spreading the word and the coins!

Thanks much!  My first ever bitcoin transaction!

I'm going to hit youtube hard today with tips, with a concerted effort to be one of the first few comments on each video, so hopefully the creators and viewers see the tip right after they post the video.  Maybe that way it wont get lost in the see of comments.

As would I.  At first I was bookmarking and going back and checking for responses.  That got to time consuming. My guess would be somewhere less than 25% are accepting the Bitcoin tips.  Though I expect that percentage to increase over time. I'm a total novice when it comes to posting actual content on youtube and don't check my channel daily.  I have been spreading out my tips between popular youtubers for the value in spreading bitcoin knowledge and small youtubers as a true tip for their work.

Didn't think to look there other than for current balance, stupid of me.  will check that!  have you had any encouraging or funny responces yet?
