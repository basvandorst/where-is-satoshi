I've been a fan of bitcoin for awhile but what do other aussies think about this news? I'm a big fan of using pay pass etc and have all my mates bank details on my internet banking but to me this seems like a big step in banking. I really like bitcoin but this is instant.. free.. potentially sent thought phone contacts etc.. I was never a fan of keeping all my money in my top office draw. This has me thinking to look to invest in other cryptos. discuss?
@_date: 2018-01-19 20:01:10
What i dont get is how everyone will store their money? Does everyone just leave their nano S in their top draw or safe at home and memorize their secret words? Is that really going to happen? I just dont see how realistic that is. I dont want to spread fud but what is average joe going to do?
@_date: 2018-01-31 08:57:28
yep will be a tough year for bitcoin - Decoupling from altcoins at exchanges, other tech doing what it does but better, visa blockchain.. I lost my belief that it'll ever get mainstream as a currency or store of value considering what is out there this year

you withdrawing to a german bank? some german banks don't accept withdraws from exchanges. I had this issue with commdirect and dkb. Works on N26 though!
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:27:45
Are you in the us or europe? I added some credit on thursday and had it on my account on friday and was able to buy in on the dip. Sucks it isnt consistant

Enjoying the show
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:47:59
Sounds like you're here to teach us all about bitcoin and how it is a bubble
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:17:36
not really that much at the moment i dont think.. What im thinking is it was an instant sell which ate up all the limit buys below it and also triggered a few trailing sells to compound the drop. putting it out there.. maybe 150btc initially? Someone feel free to correct me!
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:18:00
Europe aswell - who knows hey. I'm from Australia and australian banks will have instant bank transfers in january next year.. am hoping that Europe follows suit after that but am not keeping my hopes up!

A good month for bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:40:04
Yea the bank fees are BS.. if you can get a euro account its then much cheaper to transfer your pounds to it with transferwise then you can put it into the exchange with 0 fees added. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:30:33
They dont really push up the prices on gdax/bitstamp though
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:02:44
it looks like the euro exchange on gdax doesnt have much resistance in terms of sell walls etc.. but people keep buying it at such a high price (they could buy for 10-15% cheaper on bitstamp)
@_date: 2017-12-05 13:38:59
same 100btc wall has been up for the last 5 hours.. isnt going over for awhile yet

Also think it has to do with bitstamp adding it to their exchange. I was finally able to cash in my bth for btc.. Will see how the price goes once coinbase adds bch trading..

Its funny I asked about this about a week ago on their facebook and got the message: Hey Quansword,
N26's CEO made a brief remark the other day saying it was mainly a niche market and hadn't got any plans for the moment to introduce a crypto-currency function.
Guess they changed their mind!
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:27:56

The price is pretty weird.. over 1k more than the euro/btc on bitstamp and way higher than the gdax usd trade pair (15691.87 usd)
@_date: 2017-12-04 10:05:43
Please do something nice with your new found money!
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:22:21
My situation is a bit different to you, if anything it is harder for me cause I transfer from australians dollar to euros. I believe UK citizens can get euro accounts (even from their own uk banks). Transferwise uses the current exchange rate + a fee based on the size of the transfer. I transfered 5k and was charged 36aud.. pretty good compared to the banks. Then from there you get no fees paying through sepe accounts into say bitstamp. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:01:30
I did aswell.. but when it was 3000.. so what is your point?
@_date: 2018-09-30 09:06:26
exactly - for crypto to get mass adoption it will require banks with crypto loan services and the whole shabang otherwise it'll stay a fairly niche and volatile investment/use. Libertarians will be mad but atleast they can keep their coin on their hardwallets in their bunkers while watching info wars

it goes through quite a process to setup.. it doesnt let you just skip your seed word as it tests you on the seed word it gives you and wont let you continue until you get it correct.  You only need the seed if you lose the thing anyhow.. just dont lose it and memorize your seed :P
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:51:17
Looks like bitstamp uses segwit addresses as of august:
Users have to manually update their address to segwit on bitstamps website however.

Join one of the more secure exchanges to be able to change your usd or whatever to bitcoin as rm-rfmcc. P.s it can take a few days to verify your account etc and send money to it dependent on the exchange. So far bitcoins use is fairly limited but visa like credit/debit cards are becoming more popular linked to your bitcoin etc. Theres a whole bunch of info on the internet about it so have fun researching it!
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:38:56
you've replaced the finance industry by the sounds of it! Keep up the good work
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:27:03
cause people are buying bitcoin for 18k on gdax and people are only paying 15.5k on bitstamp.. they'll get back to being close to eachother soon once the crazy stops
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:24:15
yep was talking about using transferwise to first change his pounds to euros to save money, then euro to BTC from his euro account

Cash-based tournaments in games of skill are not considered gambling because the generally accepted definition of gambling involves three specific things: (1) the award of a prize, (2) paid-in consideration (meaning entrants pay to compete) and (3) an outcome determined on the basis of chance. Without all three of these elements, a cash competition is not gambling. In the case of Skillz tournaments, outcomes are not determined by chance, but are rather achieved through a player’s skill or ability, making these tournaments legal in most U.S. states.
Anyhow ln could def be implement like this similar to how nano quake has been implemented. Would have to be really deep coded into the game itself

Apple did have a good product though. They are known for their quality from their ipods etc and then took it to the next level in their iphones. Other companys had similar products or maybe products created earlier but you cant say apple didnt grow by not having a good product. It worked and it was easy. I would like bitcoin to work and be easy aswell - but at the moment it isnt

bitcoin isnt like apple though.. bitcoin is more like an applemac - its the product. It can be added to and amended but fundamentally cant change too much.

Is it better for miners to be in such big pools though? Why is 70-80% of the hashrate in only 6-7 pools? The incentive model for mining isnt working the way it should be and there should me more discussion into how to better decentralize these pools. If CZ thinks it is a possibility to call up his mining buddy and even ask the question something is wrong.
