By "selling bitcoin", I assume he means holding onto it until 2040 to wait to sell it.
There's a reason why every central bank wants to have a healthy rate of inflation where $1000 in a year buys you less things than if you were to buy now. If a currency devalues the longer you hold onto it in cash, it motivates people to spend it on things (which is productive) and invest their money into productive things (stocks, savings accounts). If a currency does more the longer you hold onto it in cash, it motivates people to hold onto it (like gold, bitcoin).
So obviously if your currency doesn't motivate people to do productive things with it, it has failed to be an effective currency, more of a speculative (no underlying asset / i.e. unpredictable) asset.
I don't have a degree in economics, this is just my understanding.

No, but the thing with this is that you pay $1-4 montly for ALL the websites you visit. And the cost is distributed among those sites. I'd say $4 a month for no ads on participating websites is a very micro payment.

Yes they do. They have the force of law in full effect behind the dollar, whereas Bitcoin by its inherent nature is not enforceable in any way.

But why would Google use a non-fiat currency that it does not control as a form of payment? I don't think they'll ever take that risk from a business standpoint... (Well, for that to happen Google Wallet would have to change - a big change indeed)

Essentially, GPL is not an "open-source" license at all. It is a way of telling most people that the source code is public but you cannot do any meaningful work with it, apart from academic research pretty much.
It is viral because once you use ANY library that is GPL, your entire closed source base, if you decide to distribute it, MUST be open sourced.
If you really want to go the FSF route, then at least choose LGPL. But NEVER GPL.

Well written PHP by a competent programmer is a bliss to look at and work with actually.

Yep, it's pretty much like the Mincraft Beta period - everything is playable, it's just that nothing's set in stone so everything can be continually improved

I... I don't think you understand even remotely how git works. Nice work on deleting the username and password from HEAD by the way.

The "moronic" part he is referring to is not AES, but how you are using a predefined key in AES to "encrypt" your data. That's like typing your password in reverse and calling it "encrypted".
Also, your attitude to criticism is appalling...

Yes. Otherwise, most people would not use it due to the expensive cost, or it faces the spam cost dilemma I mentioned.
@_date: 2015-02-14 06:54:54
Paying for a message is only a good idea if you get that money back. Sort of like a deposit. Otherwise, the price will be too cheap and the spammers can just pay the price.
Say you send a message to someone else with a price of $1. Then, that person replies to you with the same price. Both users break even, even with the expensive cost.
However, when a spammer sends a message, the recipient won't reply, therefore the spammer loses his money of $1 per message.

    /*
    * encrypt some of our users info, better than plain text. think of our reputation
    * if somehow our database gets dumped and our shit is in plain data LOLOLOLOLOL
    */
Basically, he is "encrypting" user data symmetrically with a pre-defined key so that his database can take up more space while being no more secure than having them in plaintext.

You're right. I stand corrected.

No. If a hacker has database access, it should be considered that he has full root access to the server (either through one of the MySQL exploits, or he has access to DB by already having root.)
In which case he can either 1. go to /var/www to find out the predefined key or 2. If the default predefined key is used, well...

Then what is the point of releasing this as open source? People aren't going to run this script for free and open their own exchanges when they will get nothing in return...
I suggest you release this under the MIT license, which is in fact the most permissible license. Either you enjoy coding and allow others to make derivative works in turn for their contributions, or you lock it down tight and try to sell it for money.
Don't get me wrong, this is indeed a great work. I'm just saying that you should be more "open" about open-sourcing your code.
P.S. Don't use GPL. It's a virus.
Edit: Also, you should add a LICENSE on the root of your repo to indicate your licensing terms, such as MIT, LGPL, All Rights Reserved, etc. The "Donate BTC" commit description really doesn't add confidence to the security of your code...

The problem here is that Git stores the differential of every change made, so even if you did make a new commit with the passwords removed, the password would still be in the previous commit "differences" file. You need to "git rebase" and force push to completely remove previous commit data.
