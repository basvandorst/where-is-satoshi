I don’t know why people don’t get this.  Bits gives many years for newbs to get used to.  I have know plenty of people that are looking to scam coins because they feel bitcoin is too expensive.  They need the penny stock feel to get cozied up to bitcoin.

Maybe when we out grow the satoshies/bits... and we need another decimal point... and developers want to add on more zeros in the program... then figure out a new decimal point...  I own a business... and look forward to being able to pricing my products in a whole number for a long time... no matter how the bitcoin price goes.  As long as we maintain the 100,000,000 status... I can always keep dropping the price amount...  People don't seem to mind paying 100k Yen for dinner for two in Japan... Why can't we?  
@_date: 2014-04-28 21:19:54

US inequality is hardly anything... Our poor according to the world is nothing compared to third world countries.  Our poor have cars and cell phones.   We have no kids with toothpick arms and bloated bellies from disease and malnutrition.  The only reason why the dirt poor of the world are in as bad a shape as they are... Is inflation combined with bad government that chain them to the grinding poverty that they are stuck in.  Yes bitcoin makes it more fair for them to escape bad government.  :-)  it's why I believe and want it to happen.

I am the owner of Crazy Chef Pub&amp;Grill in West Milwaukee, WI...  I have to admit that I was a little shocked today, when a Journal Sentinel Reporter called me... to inquire if I was the first restaurant in the area to accept bitcoin.  When I got the call, she said I was on Reddit, and sure enough.. here I am.  :-)  I knew it would be in the news eventually... it kinda puts a face to bitcoin in the local community.  
"Holding bitcoin" is being taken out of context...  I talk to all customers about me accepting bitcoin in exchange for goods and services.  When I tell bitcoin customers that I keep bitcoins... My intent is to make sure that the customer understands that I don't need the services of merchant service providers.  When I "keep my bitcoin..." I offer my workers an opportunity to invest in their future.  I offer them, cash or a portion of bitcoin that I receive.  I have told them, It's like a 401k... they can hedge against the inflation of the dollar.  Also, I encourage them to accept bitcoin as a tip from customers.  It's not mandatory for them to keep bitcoin... but I offer them the opportunity to cash in at the end of the night.  Honestly speaking... My workers are becoming bitcoin believers.  They understand that a $4-6 tip is insignificant in the grand scheme of things.  I have told them... I feel that it is my responsibility to make sure that they have every opportunity to obtain bitcoin... as much as possible.  So far as I can tell... they are beginning to understand the importance of transferring wealth around the world without any third party involvement.
Also, I offer my mom and pop vendors an opportunity to collect on the bitcoins that I accumulate.  All of my mom and pop vendors are interested in what I'm doing here.  My soda/beverage guy has said that he will accept bitcoin if the opportunity presents itself.  
Not to sound like a bitcoin evangelist... but I have visual cues for my customers "Bitcoin Accepted Here"  I have tons of people asking about it.  I always take the opportunity to tell them about how I can transfer wealth around the world and no one can stop me.  I even show them how to download Mycelium on their phone... and transfer a very small amount of wealth to their wallet... about .10 cents.  
I use my location as an area for bitcoin meetup's on MeetUp.com.  My business model is a bitcoin safe haven for people to trade freely as an alternative to the wild on the street.  Most people that trade at my restaurant know that they are among friends when they trade in bitcoin here.  Any customer should feel comfortable reaching out to my staff as a person to trust as they take the leap from fiat to crypto currency.  
I am almost absolutely certain that what I'm doing in my restaurant is going to be huge... as I grow... I will be sure to create a Bitcoin Merchant/Retailer night at my restaurant... to help others accept bitcoin at their business.  
It's only a matter of time till the rest of the population figures out what bitcoin owners are up to.  :-)
Thanks Reddit community for the publicity.  One step at a time.  Peace.

When Bitcoin goes back up... Or when I seem talking on his podcasts... I will always remind people that he said bitcoin was a star that broke and went supernova.  What an idiot.

@_date: 2014-11-23 13:35:54
He would be better off trying to get the exchanges to collaborate and have them label bitcoin in bits...   Price would skyrocket shortly after... Because people will want to trade in a while number of bitcoin.  Bitcoin was pennies on the dollars at one time...   Why couldn't we do the same thing?  Bits- pennies on the dollars.

Will you please  consider using bits as as a default setting in your app?  It will start to become more complicated as most others are switching over.  mBTC will be very short lived after bitcoin gets above $2000.
BitPay is switching to bits
BreadWallet defaults to bits for new users
Coinbase only allows BTC or bits in their settings.. No mBTC
ChangeTip is using bits only as a description of payouts
Off the top of my head... You're the only wallet in the popular range that is using mBTC as a default for noobs.
It would be nice if you could follow suit, for the next wave of adopters... help bring a little standardization for them.

You're arguing the name of it... I'm saying move the decimal down further so we have years of adoption and growth.  I don't really care what it's called.  So please argue how far to move the decimal point and articulate how long you think it will last... Cause microbits won't last long enough.  With 1million bits per BTC will last a few years as newbs move into the space.  Your response is?

I think they suggested that they were looking into it... and wanted feedback from the bitcoin community.  Also... Didn't know they were the ultimate say so.  LOL..  I find it funny that you guys feel the need for a decimal point to be inserted where it doesn't exist.  I especially love when no one can give a perfect explanation.  At least people who argue to call them 100,000,000 Sathoshies make way more sense.

Maybe some newbs sold thinking it was bad news... And didn't know that the draper coins had no effect.
@_date: 2014-08-30 16:46:47
I hold many bits for many years to come...  But I also buy with them... (Always replacing the ones I bought with)...   Also, increasing my position with a few more bits than the ones I traded for product.  What's wrong with that?  The more and more I hold makes less bits available and that drives the price up.  What's wrong with this concept?   Am I not allowed to save for the future?  Are you suggesting burn through my entire bit savings?
@_date: 2014-05-03 19:40:56
Exactly my point...  Much easier to just call them satoshies...   but the name doesn't matter to me... It's more about sticking a decimal point where it doesn't belong.  What ever it's called... just keep it simple and not add a decimal point.
@_date: 2014-07-29 15:17:35
Kevin,  since your going to do a bug fix... Could you please consider making your app default to bits when a person opens the app for the first time?

It's nice till bitcoin gets up above $10k a bitcoin... then the decimal will have to be moved again... why not just call them 100Mil Satoshies and be done it... gives us years of adoption... and the ability for poorer people to buy in much smaller increments as bitcoin as a whole continues to grow through the years.

Only transaction would be to put it on the blockchain...  Say someone was a libertarian and didn't believe in going and applying for a license but wanted a decentralized contract where both digitally sign the contract as apposed to sending the document has across the blockchain to show proof of existence.

You must be bothered by the way other people live.  Instead of being creative and recognizing that you can eliminate the spam aspect by putting the word private at the end of it... You would rather control others on how much they give.  You fail to recognize that once you influence ideological limitations... You open Pandora's box for others to subject you to their ideological views that you may not agree with.  You are more of a centralized person... Where most of us probably prefer the decentralized world... Because we're sick and tired of the legacy systems ruining creativity and intuition... Because we have to live by their set of rules.  Why are you even into bitcoin?  Why not stick with old school ways and use fiat?

Coinbase is really the only way to buy bitcoin from a business in the USA.  Coinbase doesn't require a credit card either...  They allow you to receive smaller purchases of BTC faster if you have a credit card on file.  If not Coinbase you're stuck with paying more for bitcoin from the craigslist version of localbitcoins.com.  If you have the mycelium wallet... I think they let you do a craigslist version of it too...   But keep in mind your buying from people who bought theirs on Coinbase... So, you're paying more than what Coinbase would sell it for.  You're kinda stuck with Coinbase like the rest of us till more competitors open up.   Any reason why you're afraid of Coinbase?

And kept at it all the way up to 800...   And played chill till it came back down...   So, now that it's on sale... I feel compelled to buy every pay check as well.  I will continue to buy every paycheck till it reaches 2000...  I keep telling myself... Not everyone can own a whole bitcoin... And as long as I can keep saving up "whole bitcoins"  I will always buy.   HODL BROTHER!  KEEP HODLING AS LONG AS YOU CAN!  :-)

I also like the fact that it defaults to bits when the user opens it.  It makes the most sense that the masses adopt to something that gives them a few years before they need to worry about the decimal point.  mBTC is so short sited and is only a fix for today… may tomorrow… but if bitcoin gets above $10k in the next year or two the mBTC types will be crying again.

Even copy and pasted the link "If you're a Chase Bank customer, you're probably feeling powerless right now as your private information is being sold all over the Internet"  and added the comment "Bitcoin User Not Affected"  and friends and family yawn it away with no response.   I would get it if they avoided the topic with me if I was trying to sell it to them and cramming it down their throats like some of the Tupperware, MaryKay, Avon, Norwex peoples of the world, that chases away your friends faster than a zombie in hot pursuit.  I drop the information at their door step on a consistent basis and they yawn it away... That's the worst part... Cause I want my friends to be apart of the early history too.  They are going to call me on my SAT phone in the Caribbean asking if they can borrow a couple of bits to come visit me.  That's sad.  :-(

You ignore the bigger question... if you think bitcoin is going to continue in price... you're going to be faced with the same problem in just a few months.  Most people on this thread think it's going to be $10k in a year or so... you invite a short term problem... when you could just go with a longer term problem solving solution.  If bitcoin does spike like most people think... What's your solution next year?  Most people don't answer this question... Just answer it for next year.  Entertain me with a solution for next year.

THANKS!  This technology isn't my normal thing… Since I discovered bitcoin it's opened my eyes so much on how things work on the internet.  I thought I knew a lot about the internet and software… but never really got into the verifying aspect.  I know exactly what I have to do now… (thanks to you).
One more question if I may…  I have a MAC.. (don't want to keep pestering you) Unless you know of something similar to HashSlash for MAC… I'd greatly appreciate it.  Or, if you feel you've done enough… maybe a link to a forum that deals with this?  That would be most helpful.

I think most believe that bitcoin will be in the $10k area soon.  I hate that people are trying to push milibits... I really like to have the option to view BTC in Satoshies.  Let the user end choose to see it in BTC, mBTC, or sBTC.  I own a restaurant and sell a Bitcoin Burger with a branding of the bitcoin logo on the bun.  I have it posted that I sell it for 2,000,000 sBTC.  If bitcoin gets up to $10K plus... then it will be easier to just say the burger is 200,000 satoshies... if it gets up to $20k a bitcoin... then I only ask for 100,000 sBTC.  People want to see milibits cause it makes it easier for new adopters to feel like they are getting a whole value of something vs a fraction of a value in bitcoin.  In reality... a bitcoin is a bitcoin from 1 to 21mil... a satoshi is a satoshi from 1 to 100mil of them.  I believe that most people will prefer it called a satoshi in the next few years.  I say go with it... and let people have the option to view it that way.   That's my 2 satoshies.  Just sayin
@_date: 2014-08-30 18:29:15
You still didn't answer my two questions.  Do you agree that bits would give room for plenty of growth?  Isn't it simpler just to have one unit of measure vs multiple?  Please answer both questions.
@_date: 2014-05-03 17:50:35
It's nice till bitcoin gets up above $10k a bitcoin... then the decimal will have to be moved again... why not just call them 100Mil Satoshies and be done it... gives us years of adoption... and the ability for poorer people to buy in much smaller increments as bitcoin as a whole continues to grow through the years.
@_date: 2014-04-28 20:57:15
This small business has a big chance of accepting bitcoin.  Contacted them several times about it... but they said they haven't heard of anyone accepting it... I stole most of the language from an amazon petition because it was written so well.

I wonder how the Japanese deal with such large inflationary numbers...  A nice Dinner party of 4 can cost 20,000 YEN.  ZIMBABWE IS UP TO 100trill dollar bills.  How do other cultures finger it out?  The first pizza bought in BTC was 100,000 BTC.  The buyer and seller of this pizza were able to figure this out with no problem why can't others?  The world is bigger than your economy that you live in...   
It's harder for people to deal with numbers that start to go below .00?  Under your scheme...  If BTC gets to $10,000USD...   your pricing will go sub .000?   You're arguing for the now... And bits allows adoption for many years to come.  What's more important?  Changing the scheme in another year again because your decimal point was too high, confusing the hell out of a larger mass of the population?  Or getting everyone on the same pricing plan early so we don't have to confuse the larger masses?    BTC is small right now on the local level and no one is pricing in BTC right now...  But when it grows way more expensive we will obtain pricing in BTC...  By then... No one will be talking about mBTC... The will be talking bits or maybe even satoshies.  Besides...  I like owning a couple million bits in my cold storage.  I even carry a few hundred thousand bits in my hot wallet.  Who sounds more rich?   That's my two bits.   :-)
@_date: 2014-05-06 06:08:32
Why not just call them 100,000,000 satoshies... and it gives everyone a few years to adopt into it... before you have to punt the decimal further down the road... better to get it right now while it's still early.

@_date: 2014-05-02 21:04:26
We should team up and create a movement to call them satoshies.. Bitcoin is a bitcoin from 1 to 21mil... why can't they be Satoshies from 1 to a 100mil?
@_date: 2014-12-29 02:36:41
Actually... This was discussed a while back...  The correct answer is... There will never be more than 21 trillion bits ever created.  We have to have solidarity on this one for the wave of adoption when it happens.  Noobs will push the price sky high when they realize bits are very cheap.  Just Sayin  :-)

I own Crazy Chef Pub&amp;Grill in Milwaukee, WI.  I accept Bitcoin.  the vast majority of my business is $30 to $90 bar and food tabs.  I only have 2 or 3 customers a week that pay in bitcoin... the vast majority find me on coinmap.org (greatest place to advertise your location to the bitcoin community).  Anyways, that 2 or 3 customers are only a fraction of my business. I'm a believer in bitcoin and I'm a holder.  Looking at the current price, my customers got a deal the last two weeks.  I wonder if I will get any customers while it's down.  I think that's a good thing.  Kinda like looking at market volume... Price goes down, not as many are willing to let their bitcoins go.  If he was that afraid of bitcoin volatility... tell him to not stash his bitcoins and use the third party merchants like coinbase or bitpay.  I tell everyone that I'm a believer and when the few pay in bitcoin... I treat it like my 401k...  I think bitcoin is the safest risky asset you can own.  Either way... He just has to make a choice that fits him... hold or cash in with the 3rd party merchant that will insulate them from the volatility.

13 comments and you're down to 0 votes... And heres why.  Changetip offers micro transactional payments.  Never been done before... And now the future holds this... content providers can now charge a penny for providing content.   You are short changing yourself in this future concept.  You are stuck with the fact that you're getting cheap tips... My argument to you would be... Why don't you come up with interesting content and charge 10million people a penny to watch/read your content that has gone viral?  The other side of this is...  Just because you want more money... Why do we have to live by your arbitrary limit of 50 cents?  Because it feels better to you?  Everything else feels like spam?  Did you know that you can add the word "private" at the end of the tip and it won't spam the thread with bot script?   Maybe you should complain that people in the Bitcoin thread should use "private" cause we already know what Bitcoin is... And when you tip on a non Bitcoin thread... Make sure everyone sees the tip script... So they can dig into it and join us here.  
Besides... How can I angry tip someone and tell them to keep their 2 satoshies to themselves when you arbitrarily got the price so hi?  There is a reason for micro transactional payments... Don't limit others ability to be creative because you can't see the forest through the tree line.

You're making a mountain out of a mole hill...  No one is arguing if it's a good way or not.  Question was... Is it possible...   Answer is yes.  I had even added that you could use multiple sides of a finger to generate a public key.  Quit trying to make more out of the discussion.  I don't think the guy is even going to do it. Sounded more like he wanted to know... "Is it possible?"  Answer is yes.
@_date: 2014-05-06 17:38:14
The counter argument....  When bitcoin first started... Someone paid 100,000 BTC for a pizza... no one even cared about the decimal point in that purchase.  I say just call them 100mil Satoshies... and watch it grow faster than we are prepared for.  I think we agree that bitcoin will be in the $10k range within the next 2 years.  (I think earlier)  we probably agree that bitcoin will be in the 20k-40k range before 3 to 5 years before now.  (I think way higher)  But if we see it that high in the first few years... If bitcoin were $50,000 when it starts to slow in growth (keeping in mind that I think it will be way higher before it starts to slow down)  a cup of coffee $3 at starbucks would be 6,000.  $70 dinner for two would be 140k Satoshies.  Simple and easy to understand.  Keep in mind that $70 in yen is a little more than 7000YEN.  If $50K a BTC is the slow down point for bitcoin I Can't think of a better place for the slow down to start happening for deflation.  If it gets up to the 200,000 range for bitcoin like some people think it will... We still have room before we need to start worrying about kicking the decimal point further down the road.
Do you think there is potential for bitcoin to be higher than 200,000 a bitcoin in the next 10years?

I disagree...  Bitcoin is a deflationary Currency...  Which means the purchase power will always go down.  If you're going to run into the decimal sooner than later… You're going to have to punt the ball further down the field in the near future.  If you look at the Japanese yen… dinner for to make cost 30,000 yen.... ( no decimal point)   A cup of coffee in Zimbabwe would cost you $1 trillion Zimbabwe.  If bitcoin goes parabolic over the next 5 to 10 years… My way makes it easier for adopters for a long time to come… I think that my decimal point might not be far enough.

Now where in your comment does it explain keeping it simple for mass adoption.  Bits is simple for many years.  I'm looking to the future vs right now.  If all of us called them bits right now...  Do you agree that we would have a branding theme that will last for a few years to come?  Isn't it simpler that way instead of all these nicknames that you suggest?

I know... right?  Beauty for us... bitcoin is deflationary and it will only be a short time till we start paying less bitcoins as more people adapt.  That's why it's crucial to make sure we don't add a decimal point.

Why do you want to stick a decimal point where it doesn't belong?  When bitcoin first started... it was a bitcoin from 1 to 21mil...  Why not Satoshies from 1 to 100Mil??

200 bits just cause bits is awesome @_date: 2014-12-26 23:29:51
I up voted cause I like the day dreamer conversations.  I'll be happy if we break 10k a bitcoin...   But I think very long term they are worth more than a 100k a bitcoin.  Even if it reached the same market cap as Apple stock... It would command a price above $30k a coin.  That's not hard to believe for a beginner global currency.  Just sayin.

I'm SO glad to hear this!!!!  You would probably be crying just as equal if you would have gotten stolen from too!   How many people got scammed from their bitcoins because they didn't have 2FA.   You should keep your fiat in a bank where you can have your money bubble wrapped and safe from the world.
@_date: 2014-12-09 02:47:57
Out of curiosity... Are they refunding you in fiat or bitcoin?  I'm going to ask everyone that posts a similar story.  I hope it's not fiat... Would make me suspicious... Cause if you have bitcoins on there... I would make sure they send over all the bitcoins.  
@_date: 2014-10-16 14:18:30
I disagree.. As a cop who knows a little about finger prints...  When your finger prints are entered into AFIS... It is digitally created numbers that are very large for a seed.  Each finger could be a bank  :-)  so could the palm, side of a palm, the base below your thumb.. The very tips of your fingers, the sides. Your nipple could be used... lots of entropy there.  If it's a good idea or not...  That's for the individual to decide.  I have thought of this too... But who would know if a stranger used the side of his or pinky to create an address?  What happens if you severely burn and mar a critical finger?  
@_date: 2014-05-03 16:42:23
Call them satoshies in honor of the creator... and make it 100Mil..  don't try to add a decimal where it doesn't exist... it just confuses the hell out of new adopters.

200 bits for you caring to complain about bits not being a standard... Ignoring in the fact that everyone is tipping in bits   @_date: 2014-08-30 12:09:37
So, if bitcoin gets up to $10k a bitcoin in the near future...  Will you still be satisfied that you have larger groups of newbs complaining that the price is too high?  Or will you complain to change it again and confuse the hell out of more people? Don't you think that if we all accepted bits as a new standard then we would have years of adaption?  The first pizza was bought with a 100,000 bitcoin...  Buyer and seller understood this high number.  Why can't future newbs with bits?

I wouldn't pay attention to bitcoinbabby22...   He's had bitcoin stolen... But he implies he's still in it... "Since 2010"  hmmmm if it's so risky... Why is he still into bitcoin?
It's very safe to hold a small sum in a hot wallet because if you're hacked... No big loss.  Plus not many people are complaining that their mobile wallets are getting hacked.  If you can come to the conclusion that a hot wallet is fairly safe to use for small sums... It's easy to make the next connection that your bulk savings put into properly done cold storage is really really safe.   Anything large sum should be put into cold storage.
Only threads I see about bitcoins being stolen is from a computer, brain wallet, or password hacked on an exchange.
@_date: 2014-05-03 20:03:37

It's nice till bitcoin gets up above $10k a bitcoin... then the decimal will have to be moved again... why not just call them 100Mil Satoshies and be done it... gives us years of adoption... and the ability for poorer people to buy in much smaller increments as bitcoin as a whole continues to grow through the years.

I know... but due process of law is in order.  She is probably wrong... but we have rule of law where elected officials such as judges that decide this.  If IRS feels like there is a violation... they should go through the courts and get obtain it that way. Don't know if you're from the USA... but in the Bill of Rights 4th Amendment... The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, **against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation,** and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized."

Give the other 7billion people to get caught up to speed on what bitcoin is.  Press release should be any day now.  The CEO won't stand for this kind of price drop...  Maybe the price will spike when he responds how he's going to get around the bit license regulations coming down the pipeline.

Very excited to see this!!!  I will for sure bookmark your website for future bitcoin shopping.  I agree with the other comment...  Bitpay and Coinbase will convert the bitcoin's, we pay you, into cash....   For way less than credit card fees.   I think it's free up to a million dollars in sales and anything after that is only 1% compared to the 3% in credit card sales fees.   Also... Bitcoiners like to see this recognition of savings....  Some merchants knock off the 1-2% in saving that you don't have to pay the credit card processors.  And... There are no charge backs...   Meaning I can't buy from you and claim I didn't get the product and revers the transaction like credit cards can.   It's like giving you actual cash.

$10 I will triple this amount if you do these three things.... And I'm sure bitcoiners will give even more if you do the following:
Save all your receipts of what you bought for you and your kid.
Go to the local news station with your receipts and share your story about these strangers started giving you bitcoin and converted it to food for you and your kid. The local media love heart throb stories and anything to do with bitcoin. If the media poo poos you... Let me know... I have a few connections.
Share a video link on r/Bitcoin to share your story.... So we know we didn't give in vain.
Good luck to you and your family this holiday season... Beans, rice and vitamin life... I've been there.... Dropping a tear as I type cause I know how you must feel.

This topic is about the psychology of too expensive....  You're talking about what name is best....  Whereas  I don't care if it's called bits, micros, or kilos.... I'm saying psychologically a decimal placed further down the road is best.  If you don't want to call them bits I get it...  So back to the question... Don't you think it should be pushed further doen than mBTC, kBtC or (can't do the little u for bits on my ipad)... (whatever the hell you want to call them doesn't matter).  Stand up for something you think is better instead of playing semantics.

Bitcoin is small right now… beginning stages.  Yes, right now it feels weird… BUT…If you believe bitcoin is going parabolic in the next year or two… it doesn't matter.  I, like other people, believe bitcoin will be $10K in the next year… maybe two.  I'm also a believer that bitcoin will be $100k sooner than most people think it will.  Let's pretend that bitcoin is 100K in the nest 4 to 5 years…  
That should mean a $3 USD cup of coffee would be 3,000 sBTC
Right now… If you bought dinner for two in YEN… lets say $70 today.. that would be 7,133 YEN… a new computer for $2,000USD would be 203,828 YEN…  
It's nothing new… 100 Trillion Zimbabwe Dollar… They seem to do just fine with that large of a number… Also in the late 20's the Germans had 100Mil Deutsch Marks… High denominations is no big deal because if something cost 100,500 Satoshies… they would probably ask for 100.5K Satoshies.  If it was 1,500,000 Satoshies they would probably ask for 1.5Mil sBTC  Or, in your case for the 140,000 Satoshies… they would probably ask for 140k sBTC.  
Your argument is invalid because you are only looking at it from a US currency perspective.  You're more worried about today and the next day… I'm looking at the entire ecosystem beyond the now.  Cause, if I'm right… and it grows bigger than the unconscionable… people like you will be at the same drawing board way earlier.
Most people never respond why my point just doesn't work… I anticipate your response.  But I will probably never get reply.  I guess I'm just looking for someone to prove me wrong or drag me to the other side with a more intelligent argument.
@_date: 2014-06-18 22:34:48
Not everyone agrees with millibits, microbits, bits... Etc....   Everyone seems to understand and agree 100million  satoshies = 1 bitcoin...  Why not just stick with Satoshies and we will have years of consensus before we run into the decimal point problem again???

Here is a wow factor for you...  I work for city government.  Large cities have their own gas pumps.   Back in the day... City vehicles had a gas swipe card and the employee had a swipe ID.   Cards were similar to a credit card... But we're created by the city and were generic looking.  About 6yrs ago... They got away from issuing the cards...  And found a vender to put an NFC reader ring on the nozzle and a nfc chip at the base of the opening of the gas tank.  This way the employee doesn't have to swipe the vehicle card and their employee card.  Just drive up and pump the gas... No questions asked.  The technology already exists.  No one has designed it for bitcoin yet.

@_date: 2014-07-30 04:01:26
I don't have a problem with it... I understood it right away.  I wanted to just call them satoshies... But bits seems to be winning over... And a default just means that newbies over the next few years (way larger of a community than us will probably be calling them bits because it's a default they started with... Like the bitcoins we started with.  Be happy you're going to be on your own island dealing with .000???00  you're total old school.  Hehe  when I was a kid...  Our grandpa still called the fridge an icebox...  I guess he just never cared to realize that we didn't have to go to the market for ice anymore... Just plugged it in.

I would totally pay in bitcoin... I just meant can you pick some up in cash... but I still pay you in bitcoin.  I own a restaurant and take bitcoin.  I have one vender that i've been able to convince to take bitcoin.... the rest take cash.  I'd rather spend the bitcoins that I receive from my customers on other venders.  (minus a little for me and my savings)

That's funny... I didn't know Bitpay was in charge of naming them bits...  why would you put a decimal point where it doesn't exist?  Another year from now... maybe two... people are going to want to move the decimal point down another notch or two again... why not just call them satoshies and make the new decimal point 8 decimal points down?  1btc = 100,000,000 satoshies... gives us extra time for mass adaption for the next few years... don't you agree?  Why limit yourself to a decimal point that is coming up in a few years?  
@_date: 2014-07-25 16:58:19
So you're saying that answering the universal question of… "Where can I spend my bitcoins?" will not encourage further adoption?  I think this article is only looking in the now.  Yes, I agree that places to spend your money is being dropped back into the exchanges… but it only means that merchants are getting caught up with the few users out there in the world and maybe merchants are getting ahead of the users.  What happens when the users get caught up to and outpaces the merchants?  The shockingly limited thought process to some of these articles is getting to me sometimes.

Right now bitcoin is inflationary... But long term very much deflationary.  Most agree that bitcoin market cap will easily command a $10,000 bitcoin in the very near future.  In fact if bitcoin reached the same market cap as apple... (Not hard to believe that) it would easily be 30,000 a coin....   If this is all easily obtainable in a few years... Even if $10,000 is in the next year or so... Your decimal placed to high up will be an issue all over again.  Why do you have such a stink about moving it a little further doen the road?  Gives plenty of time for newbs to adapt.

I have bought whole bitcoins all over the map....  Starting at 200... most at 400... Some at 600.  I really started to slow down at 600.  Bought a few at 800 but not much.   Rode it all the way up to 1200...  Bought a little bit at 800 then 600 again.... Now I'm sitting here thinking about throwing the rest of what I have in soon.  I'll probably average at 500.  I wouldn't sweat it if you're in for long term like me.  
@_date: 2014-10-07 00:39:12
Quick question for you... From what I understand... When I log into secure websites... My actual password is not visible to the website because when I type in a password it's sent to the secure website encrypted in some kind of hash format...  Like a signature to a Bitcoin node that confirms that I signed it,.. But the node doesn't know my private key because the broadcast ='s my public key and that's how everyone knows it's a legit signature.  Am I kinda close?  What I really want to know... If this is correct... If I use a hot wallet for casual use depositing and spending... If I spend too many times... Could someone calculate my private key?  Eventually I'm guessing that many programs will start using new private keys for every transaction... Cause we are just not there yet.
@_date: 2014-05-12 19:38:49

When I see people make the comment "hold" I usually come to the self conclusion that they are mostly like me where they use their bits as a currency, increasing their positions as time moves forward.  As long as more and more people are moving into the space..., that's all that matters.  :-)

Requires a 3rd party and payment to third party.  The way I'm describing it doesn't require a 3rd party to facilitate the transaction... I'm really looking at this as an angle for a Poor Man's Contract... So someone in the future can create a generic document get signatures and avoid costly fees that go with attorneys, notary... Etc  just the people involved....  Maybe even a marriage and a third person sign as a witness.

Just make sure you correct people when they talk about how many bitcoins are going to be produced...  And make sure you say "there will only be 21trillion bits ever minted... Enough for the whole world to share.  Right now... You can pick up 200bits for about a whole dollar."
@_date: 2014-12-13 13:51:37
Let me brainstorm incentives on why I got into bitcoin...
-No third party can freeze my account
-No third party can confiscate from my account
-I don't have to give my personal information to transact
-I don't have to worry about my personal information being stolen
-Its voluntary and not forced like fiat by my government
-I don't have to worry about receiving a counterfeit bitcoin
-Accepted more and more each day on a GLOBAL level unlike local fiat
-Eventually, I probably won't have to worry about conversion rate
Seriously... Do I need to continue any more on the benefits?  I can... Or maybe I'll start a new thread and ask people to brainstorm on what the benefits of bitcoin are for users...
I saved my favorite for last...  
-The dirt poor of the world can transact on the same global economic status as the industrialized nations... Over night!

I bought some last year at 400, 600, &amp; 800.....  thought I was done buying as it kept going up.... but since it's been going down... bought a little more at 600, 500, 440.....  I came to the conclusion that I will keep buying till it's up to 3000...  by then I will have bought as much as I can afford to loose.  If it's up to 3000... I'm pretty well off by that point and don't have a need to purchase any more.  Then I hold for the next 5 years or so... and only buying more only to replace what I burn when I buy stuff with it.  I will be frugal with my bitcoin but want to contribute to the community by funneling my salary into merchants as they come online.  That way I'm not burning through my bitcoins for the next 5 years or so.  I'll always be happy to work while it goes parabolic over this time frame.  No matter how many bubbles happen.  :-)

@_date: 2014-08-05 19:29:12
Thanks… I'm aware of the proofofexistence link and I would just use my MAC that already creates a hash… You did open my eyes to an idea of dividing the hash into three… (just not sure that's what I'm looking to do).  
I really need a system that has a standard where I can enter a hash and it generates a send to multisig address.  
Although… I really liked your outside of the box thinking and send me your public key cause it was a good idea that really got me thinking.
Back to your idea…
So, you're saying that all three addresses make up the multisig address?  Do the three people use the private key of their addresses to authorize the withdrawal from it?  What program would the three use to spend from it.
Reason why I want to do it my way…  I should probably describe it as a Poor Man's Contract.  I get proof of existence that the contract exists when it's deposited into by 2 or more parties.  Then I have proof that both parties agreed to the document when both parties authorized pulling the satoshies they deposited from it.
Oh, and don't forget to send your public key.  :-)

Every paycheck I buy a little at a time... I'm all over the map.  Be like me... Today's price doesn't matter.. don't try to be greedy and buy at the lowest price.  Once you start buying a little every paycheck... It really removes the emotion of trying to buy the lowest amount.  I've been doing for almost 2 years.. and I'll keep doing it for 3 or 4 more years.  Trust me, I'm from the internet.. this plan works.  :-)

If I was blockchain.info.. I would be extatic that people came to my website.  Besides... if someone doesn't know what the "real" blockchain is... chances are it doesn't matter.  Cause if they knew what the real blockchain is... They wouldn't be googling it.  When I first heard of bitcoin and read about "blockchain" I found their website and saw all the transactions happening.  Seeing this website increased my awareness that transactions are happening around the world and they were an outlet to see it happening.  I kept digging and my growth lead me to understand that the website is not blockchain.info.  I saw them as a stepping stool beyond bitcoin.org.  They provide an eye opening website on how the blockchain works.... and this is good for people.  I'm sure when people catch on to what the blockchain is...  they will change the dynamics of their website into something profitable related to blockchain.  By then... more people will know the difference.

There are other exchanges in the US...  but you take on major risk the smaller the company.  Coinbase received 20mill in venture capital... And a small company doesn't get that kind of money from vc's unless they have been thoroughly vetted by the investors.  When they got that kind of funding... It's easier and more reassuring that they will be around for awhile and not run off with your money.

Well, maybe you know something that I don't...  Is Bitcoin creation not deflating every 4 or so years?  Does the creation stop in 120 years or so?  Are people not losing private keys?  
What gives on trying to get technical in a casual conversation?  Arbitrary arguments go nowhere.  If you're going to get technical on this... I will have to correct you by saying your labeling the "price" is inflationary... Is an incorrect statement.  The price is not inflationary.  The price has to deal with the supply and demand in the market place.  Or, should I just overlook you misuse of the statement, cause you were speaking casually to the topic like I was?

Bits are going to be worth a dollar someday... Why would I care if someone gives me 200 bits to use in the future? @_date: 2014-12-17 14:27:34
You are correct!  That actually makes it sound like a global currency by today's standards and measurements.
@_date: 2014-05-02 19:23:32
WTF?  Never seen that before.
@_date: 2014-01-24 17:27:04
So many possibilities… For sure it will be fun to watch.  
@_date: 2014-11-19 04:42:51
It's this worthless shill coin that no one uses.  hehe
@_date: 2014-07-25 19:22:20
He probably doesn't want your green peace of $hi7 car you democrat agenda pusher...   He can buy my truck for the right price if he's willing to pay a reasonable sum in bitcoin.  
@_date: 2017-02-17 14:16:27
Tooooo funny!!!! �� 
@_date: 2015-05-03 15:15:23
This is cheaper and more durable... 
@_date: 2014-09-25 14:49:51
Where do I find this number?
@_date: 2015-05-21 21:30:30
You should take down this post before your shamed for not knowing that tomorrow is bitcoin pizza day!!!
@_date: 2015-05-21 14:10:13
I did... he got back to me later in the day... just not sure if I should download from his personal dropbox account.  I have a dummy laptop that never touches the internet.  I might upload it to that.  
Here is the message with the link he sent me.  If you want to play around with it.  :-)  Let me know if any bitcoins get stolen.  hehe








@_date: 2014-10-25 15:08:44
.00000001 &lt;--- I'm right here  :-)
@_date: 2014-08-05 16:27:46
Not available in my country.  :-(
@_date: 2015-05-13 14:38:42
I still think we are in the middle of the innovator stage.  Companies are still coming out with concept programs... Making way for the early adopters.  
@_date: 2015-05-19 20:49:56
Not saying that... Just saying we should always keep an eye on the enemy.  History is riddled with David and Goliath moments.
@_date: 2015-05-24 04:24:11
@_date: 2014-12-16 15:11:08
Bitcoin implementation into Explore allowing micro payments on content providers websites like Time Magazine?  What was the reason for hash tagging    ?
@_date: 2015-05-03 15:33:36
You can drill a small hole in it... and they also make a coin... and you can drill a hole in that like I did with mine.  :-)
@_date: 2015-05-19 17:53:01
Thanks for this!  It's exactly what the doctor ordered!  
Since you're probably an expert... Any need to worry about people knowing my salt? Connected to the Internet while I do it?  I'm assuming not really cause the RNG in the entropy creates the randomness from more than 1 random way.... As I understand it... Salt is another "personal" layer of randomness.  Is it important to seek out keeping the salt secret?
Second part would be... How do I verify that my salt is being used?  Do you know if that is explained step by step anywhere?
I don't trust my friends and family to deal with bitcoin safely till the bitcoin ecosystem matures enough for them to make their own confident decisions.  I'm trying to make it so I'm the go to guy for them to stop by, plug it into their printer, quick and easy.
Thanks for the help!
@_date: 2014-10-04 17:43:54
I'm in it for both the money and the change.  I'm depressed that people (friends and family) who don't get bitcoin yet, aren't trying to figure it out fast enough.   Why they are lazy to investigate it and come to a self evident conclusion how powerful bitcoin is beyond me.  But hey... Bitcoin is on sale  and the inside joke is we're all rich, the rest of the world just doesn't know it yet.  :-)
@_date: 2014-04-15 19:59:58
"It's a rich man's world"  Love that song!  Great... now it's going to be stuck in my head for the remainder of the day.
@_date: 2015-05-05 19:52:47
[I fart in your general direction.]( Is that what French smell like?  :-)
@_date: 2014-09-29 15:08:08
Tina, do you have a link on when the bit license is supposed to come out?  I thought I remember seeing a video of SuperNintendo Lawsky saying later the year... Maybe early next year.  He almost seems to cautious.. Maybe dragging this out longer than he needs too.  Regulations of how people transact in bitcoin is only as complicated as you want to make it.  IMHO  :-)
@_date: 2014-04-23 16:37:17
lol... agreed!
@_date: 2015-05-24 04:45:02
The website is getting the hug of death cause it's real popular right now.  Just keep trying if you get lag.
@_date: 2015-05-22 20:59:54
I know!  Right?
@_date: 2015-05-21 23:41:15
Yes... And at time of post... OP posted before midnight in his time zone.  OP was called out for not being correct.
@_date: 2015-01-27 06:19:56
It makes it a really great savings plan for the poor who do not have access to higher end investments like people with jobs.  Think of it as money for the poor that will help them have better access to investment all on their own without having to pay people to invest it for them.  
@_date: 2015-01-26 06:39:49
I'm luvin it too!  :-)
@_date: 2015-01-07 13:39:51
You have no idea what you're talking about... Why not down vote and move on.
@_date: 2015-01-07 04:18:44
I do too... But not family.  
@_date: 2015-01-07 06:01:33
I can risk the 300 bucks.  Nothing ventured, nothing gained.  
@_date: 2015-01-10 21:53:21
David Seamen... The great spokesman for bitcoin and was crying/claiming that bitcoin was all over because of the bear whale a few months back.  Then he pumps and dumps other alt coins.  I don't know how this guy gets any time of day...  maybe this is why he goes to Coast to Coast show.
@_date: 2015-01-07 17:55:42
Keep your 2 bits to yourself @_date: 2015-01-07 05:23:57
How do you jump to the conclusion that I'm selling?  I really don't think that my meager encouragement with family will ever influence the market.  How long have you been into bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-01-09 01:55:50
I figured this would be the statement cause it makes sense when you think it out.  Bitcoin runs outside of Space Time Continuum.  :-)
@_date: 2015-01-07 04:54:52
I'm a little more shocked that some of our fellow bitcoiners are a little shy about sharing their beliefs.  Maybe it's cause I'm a libertarian... and got into it for ideological reasons.  I'm just not that shy about it.  I understand when some people over preach to their friends... but they seem more worried that I sound like nut job vs an incorrect argument.  What was my incorrect statement they want to argue?  I rest my case.  :-)
@_date: 2015-01-20 04:14:36
Actually....  We are moving away from saying 21million bitcoins...  We are switching the phrase to... "There will never be more than 21 trillion bits ever created."  Now there is enough for everyone to go around.  :-)
@_date: 2015-01-08 00:26:42
I guess you're not that bullish if you haven't set up receiving bitcoin tips yet.  :-(
@_date: 2015-05-19 18:39:52
I thought this company was going bankrupt.. Or something about the CEO dying... Or the government shut them down after illegally selling centralized coins to the wrong person!  
@_date: 2015-01-07 04:17:58
Is it insane to encourage a family member to buy a whole Bitcoin for under $300?  Lol... I guess I am.  Guilty as charged.
@_date: 2015-01-26 03:28:26
Do you have a link to back that?  Wouldn't you be better off saying it's going to be something cheesy?  
@_date: 2015-01-26 02:52:27
That was funny
@_date: 2015-01-07 13:43:12
Those are good laying it on thick ones.  :-)
@_date: 2015-01-30 12:41:46
Why you?  Why are you being asked to explain it?
@_date: 2015-01-26 03:02:42
It would if the customers were being told "that will be 146k bits."  
@_date: 2015-01-10 05:03:16
Actually it's 21 trillion  bits that will be created into existence.   We are moving away from the bitcoin denomination.
@_date: 2015-01-08 16:36:25
I'm all for this... But my gut feeling is telling me that it will be taken down.  :-(  how long till someone says it's a beginners tool for kids gambling.  Damn people and their morality subjected on others.  
@_date: 2015-05-19 19:22:03
You throw the dagger in the sand when the line has been crossed.
@_date: 2015-01-26 03:34:26
Do you know hoe stupid that sounds...  Why hugs?  Who hugs who?  Can you imagine the implications of physical touching of customers with employees.   ???  Where do you get something stupid like hugs from?
@_date: 2017-02-28 02:01:39
Yes.. but the people can still buy their bitcoin in this scenario... and poo poo the government and their silliness.  
@_date: 2015-01-26 05:21:09
Someone just posted a reminder article from two months ago about McDonald's and bitcoin.  Something about McDonald's looking into making the payment easier for customers.  Good read.
@_date: 2015-01-26 02:37:03
It would if the clerk said that will be 145,000 bits.  Just sayin
@_date: 2015-01-07 06:05:56
You have to remember... every family is different.  As I said before... I don't say the same things to friends and strangers.  Close family... I don't have a problem with them knowing what I'm up to.  I'm probably a little more faithful than most... but that isn't a crime.  Is there something about the protocol that people are saying is bad?  Outside of that... I don't play into the day to day politics of the price.  I don't really care about it.
@_date: 2015-01-07 05:15:25
I edited grammer... stupid iphone jumps around... maybe it's my insane mind that jumps ahead of texting thumbs sometimes.
@_date: 2015-05-19 20:48:35
Yes... And stab them in the back with it!
@_date: 2017-02-28 02:18:52
Lol... agreed!
@_date: 2014-08-20 03:45:44
More and more new people are moving into the space... Better they get accustomed to bits.  It's only a matter of time till bitcoin is higher than $10k... And all you mBTC fans will be crying to change it.  Just stick with bits... The masses will thank you when they learn what bitcoin is. 
@_date: 2015-01-07 05:19:01
It is what it is.  :-(
@_date: 2015-01-12 03:12:12
This is my point as well.  Thanks for wording it before I got back to respond.
@_date: 2015-01-10 04:38:51
I think it would be a split... Like... Get paid 5% bitcoin as an investment... And 95% standard pay.
@_date: 2015-01-07 05:31:07
Could you please explain how a one time response was laying it on thick? The gist of the message was... Keep doing your homework on bitcoin and its going to be huge. Wouldn't laying it on thick consist of deep Libertarian beliefs, Inflation, being a doomsday prepper for the great financial collapse, the FED, anything bad governement. 
@_date: 2015-01-07 06:21:18
I know... agreed.  It's a late night... and I like to test the waters with shills every once in a while... see where they go.
@_date: 2015-01-08 05:05:40
A lot of your comments on other threads are just complaining... Nothing much constructive.  And a lot of your comments are on why don't you just hang out there with your shill friends.   You're not offering anything intellectual on reddit.  like I said... All your comments are just complaining.  Why even bother here?
@_date: 2015-01-27 06:26:24
You're probably right... But dont forget.. This was two months ago... And look at the quote from the CEO...
@_date: 2015-01-07 05:41:21
PYRAMID SCHEME... Requires me to solicit sucker to go through me to obtain product from me, they solicit more suckers to go through them to get my product,  The second group of suckers are solicited to do the same and they can be like me. All of their investments lead to me.
PONZI SCHEME... Requires me to solicit sucker to give me their money cause I got this really great secret investment... I tell them they doubled their investment.  I then solicit them to get other suckers to invest more into my secret investment and they can do even better on their return.  As more suckers buy in... I solicit them to keep funneling more money into my secret investment... again all money leads to me.
The gist of the message was... Keep doing your homework on bitcoin and it's going to be huge.  How does this equate to a ponzi or pyramid scheme?
@_date: 2015-01-07 05:13:10
LOL... Mostly messages that I saw come in... but never clicked on.  I wish I was that popular too.
@_date: 2014-08-06 17:06:03
I recommend bread wallet...  It is very simple and easy to use for someone who is just a beginner.  Got parents and grandparents to use it and practice buying on the internet.  That's how easy it is for them.
@_date: 2015-01-23 17:07:51
This person should not be on the internet unsupervised.
@_date: 2015-01-07 05:54:11
Oh... and for the small sum of $300 or less... absolutely, bitcoin is worth waiting to see what happens.
@_date: 2015-01-07 04:20:11
Some people don't get my sarcasm.
@_date: 2015-01-26 03:54:35
What would they comment on?
@_date: 2015-01-27 06:23:54
This was only two months ago...
@_date: 2015-01-07 05:42:33
And why would that be bad?  Do you think something is wrong with bitcoin?  (seriously confused or not getting the point)
@_date: 2015-05-19 19:11:22
I know... They are the enemy... That's why the dagger has been thrown.
@_date: 2015-01-07 04:56:28
Do you think it's bad for someone to throw $300 in for a whole bitcoin? Or encourage a loved one to do it?
@_date: 2015-01-26 03:51:25
If it is bitcoin... It will only be accepted at **randomly** participating locations.  :-)
@_date: 2015-01-24 15:38:08
Curious to know what happened to the private keys.  Hehe
@_date: 2015-01-26 04:53:38
Not pissy... Conductive reasoning... Hugs compared to bitcoin.  Which one is more possible?
@_date: 2015-01-26 05:31:20
I love this part of the article...
McDonald’s CEO Don Thompson said:
“We did a major test in Australia to look at the actual global application what we call the global app, which is built upon our new-path technology system and allows us to continue to add on different applications to support various needs from pay and order to other things such as music. That global app will be launched in 2015 ” he added.
@_date: 2015-01-26 03:55:26
I haven't seen that in forever!
@_date: 2015-01-07 05:52:31
Hey... Prof Bitcorn said $10
@_date: 2015-01-26 03:15:40
At my restaurant... Once Ina while... I would joking say the price of bitcoin in bits... And people laughed at it... Awkwardly the same response.    I'm sure it's something else... But wouldn't this be wow factor if it happened?
@_date: 2015-01-07 05:47:04
Cause it's family... and i've done my homework... and it's worth the risk of buying one whole bitcoin.  Encouraged them to challenge me.  I don't live my life bubble wrapping myself from the loss of $300 on what seems like an investment of this magnitude.  Your risk might be a lot less... please don't confuse this as a life savings guide.  
@_date: 2015-01-07 04:06:16
I agree... I would refrain from wild prediction conversations with friends and strangers... But family... I have no problem with the wild side if it gets them to buy a whole bitcoin or two.  It's too important to pass up a small amount of cash for the next 5 years.  She is too conservative for bitcoin... And will probably buy after the next two or three bubbles.  :-(
@_date: 2015-01-07 13:44:32
How can you straight forward call bitcoin a ponzi scheme??
@_date: 2015-01-07 06:21:56
Actually... Powerball is too risky for me.  hehe.  
@_date: 2015-01-19 23:54:16
On YouTube it's called SmarterEveryDay
@_date: 2015-01-26 03:00:34
Can you confirm that it's "hugs"  where did you get that from?
@_date: 2015-01-26 04:55:46
On iOS... Not to sure about that one...   Bread just takes the cake in noob and ease of use.   I like the randomness send address feature the best.  Creates random security from the get go.
@_date: 2015-01-26 04:52:33
You're a noob... What do you know?
@_date: 2015-01-26 03:31:09
Either way... We have had a couple of big hitters in the online space.... Wouldn't it be interesting to see a heavy hitter in the brick and mortar area of businesses?  It's a software push for them at their restaurants on their digital screen...  Someone smaller like Chipotle might have a harder time... Registers are not networked.
@_date: 2015-01-07 05:51:46
Yeah... were not in the same mindset about what bitcoin is.  Not on the same page or topic for sure.  You're talking one thing... I'm just looking out for a family member on a small investment, worthwhile risk.
@_date: 2015-01-07 13:42:02
Who cares what the prices is?  It isn't a life savings.  For me too... It's about the potential of what it has to offer.
@_date: 2015-01-08 16:28:53
Friends and family are always keeping tabs with me in the bitcoin story.. I make it interesting enough.  Unfortunately not many have bought... But I blame laziness to set up an account  to buy it.
@_date: 2015-01-12 03:16:03
No... a few million people used it before this video was even produced.  Also.. the guys sister was married to a bitcoiner as well.  Theoretically... she would be a black person before Ronald.  Your headline starts to fall apart already.  Please delete the topic.  It's not true based on mathematics of demographics involved.  I have earlier videos of black people using it... and you have no way to substantiate that Ronald was into bitcoin before this video was posted.  We can go in circles on this topic all you want.. but very ignorant headline.
@_date: 2015-01-07 05:52:09
That's my favorite line... like that?
@_date: 2015-01-07 14:58:27
You should stop while you're ahead... Go read about a Ponzi scheme and come back with a factual argument on a pyramid scheme... And how it applies to bitcoin.  Until you are better read on the topic... Please down vote and move on.
@_date: 2016-01-23 19:44:16
Thanks!  That was fast!
@_date: 2015-01-07 04:09:17
It's funny you say that... Cause I also tell them "the best part about my sales pitch... I'm not selling you any."  That always throws them for a loop.  But I always talk about how it's different than the Norwex, Tupperware, Avon, Mary Kay's of the world.  
@_date: 2015-01-12 02:36:09
Please change this... this is not the first black person to use bitcoin.  
@_date: 2015-01-07 15:52:52
All your past posts are negative and you mostly hang out on buttcoin...  Why don't you quit being a shill and move on?
@_date: 2015-05-20 15:06:43
Yeah.... And how much is the fine compared to how much they stole.  Notice that anywhere in the mainstream news?
@_date: 2015-01-07 04:12:48
Yep...  CDC for short if that gets you thinking about it a little more.  Hehe
@_date: 2015-01-07 06:01:25
I'm not that kind of gambler.  Only buy a little here and there ever pay check.  If bitstamp goes down crash and burn... I'll probably buy a little more.  Don't know what that has to do with bitcoin the protocol... It would probably make the price go down... and i'm buying long term.
@_date: 2015-01-07 05:10:52
That's for them to figure out... I can only take the horse to the water... I can't make them drink it.  
Don't worry about it... The best way to help people figure out bitcoin... is be there to answer those types of questions when they ask.  I only tell them that I know something that they don't and if they want to challenge me, I'm all ears and able to answer those questions.  Keep in mind... last time I talked about it with her was last August.  That's a long time... and yet she hasn't bought.  :-(
@_date: 2015-01-20 00:02:23
I love this sarcasm... I thought I was the only one here that had the same kind of humor.  Thanks for the chuckle.  Hehe  
@_date: 2015-01-27 06:17:02
It's 21 trillion bits for everyone to pass around.  
21,000,000 bitcoins + 6 zeros =
21,000,000,000,000.  00 &lt;-Satoshies  :-)
Tr   B     M   Th   H
We basically say that there will never be more than 21 trillions bits ever mined!  :-)
@_date: 2015-01-09 15:32:23
Amicable.... As in... It wasn't working together and it was just best to go your own ways?  
@_date: 2014-10-21 23:15:05
I really do like breadwallet... Its my favorite to use.  Airbitz offers a little higher end user concept.  I don't expect it to be perfect just yet.  I like the concept of using bluetooth technology to transfer...  but I like that I can I can access from multiple devices... without having to give up my private keys to them.
@_date: 2015-01-26 02:49:17
@_date: 2015-01-07 13:46:42
She would still be positive if she bought when I told her almost 2years ago.  And she thinks bitcoin got hacked.  Long term holder... Not a day trader.  
@_date: 2015-01-26 04:01:33
Thanks... I'm luving it.  :-)
@_date: 2015-05-25 02:06:09
I was just posting what other people found.  I just found it interesting.  
Given the creator could change the algorithm at any given time...  But couldn't he post the algorithm and have it be open sourced.  Then the average Bitcoiner could find a random page of text, sha256 the text in the page to create a private key, and finally book mark the page as a brain wallet, with a hand written note....  Then escape any country, Cross any border of the world and No border agent could ever figure out what it means... Cause it's a book mark to something that only the op knows.  
Granted this is relying on the creator supplying the algorithm of the library of babble... But mind boggling how this could be used.
@_date: 2017-02-11 03:45:08
It didn't say adopt.... it used the word "embrace."
@_date: 2014-10-20 17:51:56
Yeah... I can buy a bunch of bits on coinbase on my iphone... pretty fast.  :-)
@_date: 2014-11-02 19:52:18
They started QE1, when they removed it... Markets went unstable and then they tried QE2.... Then QE3...   Most gold and bitcoin bugs believe that the markets are dependent on printing money to keep the markets alive.  Wall Street is doing awesome but Main Street has been sucking a lemon since the markets collapsed...  The bugs believe it's a zombie economy, with manipulated growth from constant QE.  QE was sold to the public as an Emergency Measure....   When most markets collapse, it lasts a few months, maybe up to 2 years... So, the 4trillion dollar questions are... How bad is the economy if we've been printing for 6years? You should then ask yourself... What does it mean for bitcoin when they do start QE4?  :-)
(Going off on a tangent) When, after 6,7,8??? yrs do people wake up and say... "It never used to be like this."  Who wants to be in the markets when that comes to fruition?  GO BITCOIN!!!
@_date: 2015-01-31 06:46:41
I agree.
@_date: 2015-05-21 21:28:42
It's not the 22nd yet!!!  
@_date: 2014-07-31 17:47:02
Lol... I don't know... I found it on the internet... So, it must be real.  Hehe
@_date: 2015-01-26 05:23:11
This is going to bug me all the way to the Super Bowl!  If it happens or not... It's fun to think about.  :-)  Good find!
@_date: 2015-01-19 19:22:09
I love his videos too!!!
@_date: 2015-01-07 05:48:48
Meh.. I've got time to kill tonight.  I think it's more curiosity to see where it goes.  I like this kind of stuff.  Keeps me on my toes. 
@_date: 2015-01-07 06:41:09
I knew what was going on... Think about it this way... Why did I get so many comments on how bad bitcoin is all at once?  One simple post... and all the responses seemed off the beaten path.

I was looking for a how to... with step by step... But even what you said didn't make sense.  Just reading what little I found on their website says to put it in the setting.txt file.
Anyways.. Looking for a play by play manual that explains what I'm about to do and what practices are best while I do it... And why I would do it one way over another.  
I'll explain it this way... I shoot firearms all the time and teach people how to shoot.  If someone came to me and said I want to shoot a gun... I couldn't just say put a bullet in the chamber and pull the trigger.  Id show them what lever to press to open it, and to make sure that the gun was pointed in a safe direction.  I'd talk about knowing their surroundings, paying extra attention to what was beyond the target they were aiming at in case they missed.
So, yes! I know how to put the thing in the USB port... And I know how to type and use a mouse.  I might even know a few old school language commands for creating a website.  But you can't be serious when you say just put it in the config file.  It doesn't answer any of my inquisitive and cautious mindset questions.  More specifically and not limited to these questions...
Disconnect Internet from computer when doing this? 
Is it recommended to use something like tails? 
Definitions for hexadecimal?  Examples of it written into the text file.
I've already read the link you provided... But it isn't a step by step for dummies.

You must be kind of new to bitcoin… many of the exchanges have already allowed bits as an option.  Some of the wallets already default into bits as a nomenclature for smaller denominations of bitcoin.   You should probably do a little research before you start calling people stupid.

Notice how you skip over what established communities have done and present no alternative option that would be superior.  Your opinion may make you feel as though it is stupid...  but one thing is for sure... people will gravitate toward the simplest and more natural route.... regardless of your thoughts on what is perfect.  You should google the meme called user experience vs design.  It might teach you a few things about life.

@_date: 2015-04-08 02:34:00
I understand perfectly...  Here in the USA they talk about inequality increasing all the time... Yet the average poor person has 1.2 cars, 2 color tvs, cable&amp;winter net, free healthcare, larger square foot homes than middle class of the rest of the world...  On and on it goes.... Yet they want what the next guy has... This is a timeless argument.  If you want to deal with inequality directly... You need to deal with government that rich people pay off to give them a better deal.  Technology needs to move forward without hesitation or second thought... Cause the sooner a technology can make a break through, the sooner the poor can have it.  Like I said, it's some complete goof trying to give himself a soapbox to stand on and feel good about something while grand standing about technology causing the disparity.  If he was smart... He would encourage the growth of bitcoin to anyone, rich or poor... Cause it evens the playing field for everyone.  Bitcoin will most likely happen in poorer countries that have bad monetary policy compared to here... Most likely causing a paradigm shift where the rich have little bitcoin and the poor have the majority.

This guy has no clue on what he is talking about.  People have and other people do not have.... Has been a debate for the centuries.  But this guy simply ignores how much technology has helped the poor.  I'm 40 yrs old... I grew up watching the news covering famine with little bloated belly kids with toothpick arms.  You seriously have to ask someone in my age category or older... When is the last time you heard of a famine?  Cause they know the true meaning to how much trickle down technology has helped them in just the last few decades.   
WithIn the next few years... There will be more smart phones than humans in the world.  Is it hard for anyone to imagine that the dirt poor of the world will have access to this technology, in the very near future?  Also... It's been said many times... The poor will probably adopt to Bitcoin faster than the industrialized nations because the poor need it more than us.  Just blew a hole in his argument right there.  So, I ask.... Is this guy just grand standing how much he cares about the poor to a large group of people, so he can feel better about life? He can't be serious on this topic.
I'm sorry for sounding obnoxious, but this mans ignorance irks me.... Cause it's all politically motivated with political correctness about the poor.

The vast majority of his videos have been with almost always women and it seems like he interviews them to show off that he does "independent journalism." Since this was pointed out the other day… He seems to now be doing "independent journalism."  His last two videos have been on Bitcoin.… Where as in the past when the great bear whale happened a few months ago… He was a manic-depressive saying that he didn't think Bitcoin would ever come back.

I agree... I would add that quality wallets really never came along until a year ago... In my book we are only a year and a half in.  The first 2-3 years was people creating a foundation for bitcoin to be functional.  The last 2-3 years have been early startups figuring out connections with others to get started... It's only been a little more than a year for quality wallets to be on all devices.  (Don't forget that wallets were banned until almost a year ago).  I think we have a foundation and we are just about to start the mass adoption phase.  Plus a few hiccups along the way.

No... I have no problem with people in secret societies... It's a fundamental right and I commented on this question earlier.  What I don't like is Bruce Fenton being a person in the lime light talking about openness and transparency of bitcoin... And now pushing his secret society agenda.  They exist for two opposite reasons.  As a libertarian who supports his right to be apart of this type of society... I strongly support anyone questioning people who join some types of societies.  
@_date: 2017-05-09 21:28:46
I agree... I think that mBTC is going to be very short lived.  It almost seems like we have to think of the next price floor as logarithmic.... meaning we are in $1-$1,000... now it's going to be $1,000-$1,000,000

TL;DR:  this is a video about a guy who is preaching Marxism… He does not cover how people have died at the hands of Marxism from starvation and despair.  It's mostly propaganda.

Oh... I misread the statement.  I forgot about SSSS on bitaddress.org. 
@_date: 2015-03-20 19:16:09
I agree... also... from this angle... aren't they acting more like the FED... creating something out of nothing in return for more of your money or bitcoins?  It's a Fiat system all around.  As bitcoin slows down in creation and more people adopt... price can only go up log term.  Why get stuck in some monetary trap?
@_date: 2015-03-20 12:01:26
I agree the fed can keep printing....  I also think QE is explained better this way...
QE is like the a satellite orbiting the earth.... The satellite is technically falling to earth, but earth is moving out of its way faster than the satellite can crash into it.  
Earth moving = FED printing money
Satellite = The People
Gravity = The Free Market

Food for thought… If Bitcoin gets listed as an ETF on the NASDAQ… I wonder if it could potentially raise the value of the NASDAQ exponentially and make it out pace the other exchanges… Given Bitcoin taking off.  :-)  
Full disclosure… I've never been formally trained in the markets. :-(  this should not be taken as fact… Because I do not know if ETFs are used to calculate exchanges.  it's probably only calculated by business growth.  anyways… It was a fun thought. :-)

If they would have covered the Why of Bitcoin... It would appeal to older generations for sure.  
@_date: 2015-03-27 16:30:22
Yes... But how do the unaware know that they are making a critical mistake?  Also, he openly admitted that he didn't get it fully and that it looked like the tulip mania cause of the way people are investing.  It doesn't appear that he is calling it a tulip mania other than that it feels like similar to it.  There is a distinguishable difference to claiming something feels like it and being cautious.
@_date: 2015-03-05 12:15:59

I don't think you're keeping it realistic... the man only posts dirt on what he gets a hold of.  If 911 was a real inside job... it will make its way out into the open.  Until then... i wouldn't put all expectations into one man that has nothing to do with 911.

Is it me?  Or is David Seaman kind of a creeper?  Claims to be a journalist... But he seems to use his podcast to show off to women he interviews.  On a side note... in early days he pumped a lot of alt coins.  Nothing serious about what this guy does.  Oh, that's right... He also had his manic depression when Bitcoin dropped during the bear whale episode, a few months back... Claiming that he didn't think Bitcoin would ever recover.  Or, at least hinted at it... I'd have to go back to see what it was that he fully said, but without exaggeration, It was something close to that.  It's just creepy.

I'm not disagreeing with you about 911... I'm disagreeing with putting responsibility on Julian Assange to be your guy for answers.  Correct me if I'm wrong... but you whole reason for your initial comment was that you were disgruntled that he disagrees with you about 911.  I couldn't really care what he thinks about it... cause he has nothing to do with 911.  He wasn't president, working for the FBI, or an engineer that researched how the buildings fell.  My point is... it doesn't matter what he thinks.  Keep your emotions about what Assange thinks about 911 into context.  He's just some guy that leaks information when he gets the dirt on government institutions.  Who really cares what he thinks about 911?

You could say the converse... What happens when people want bitcoin more than gold?  Gold is hard to figure out for most people and hard to transact in.  I don't load up with gold and silver when I travel abroad.  Not many people know how to acid test for counterfeit gold and bitcoin is more trustworthy in this regard.  I don't think many people own gold.  Mostly a little bit of Hewlett here and there.  What happens to the price when when major institutions hold bitcoin and people use it to transact?  If say there is a larger possibility for the converse.  :-)

The person asked if I could justify if they were... The poster had obviously seen the video... And in the video the person describes how they only allow men into its society which is a secret society for this reason.  Also, I provided a "Let Me google that for you" which describes in detail their secret society.  I was only asked to clarify that they were... Not provide quality if that's your beef.  You seem to think there is a better way to describe how much of a secret society they are...  Please go into detail and be very descriptive on how secret they really are.

What's interesting... It doesn't cover that almost all users seem to be satisfied with their internet as is.  So, what problem is this solving?  
Secondly... Why not let technology solve this problem?  "Out of necessity comes invention."  Now that the government is involved... The watchmen of the Internet will want to increase their authority.. Cause that's what government does.  Understanding that we all don't think the same... Who's saying that the next political power in control isn't going to manipulate the law the way it wasn't intended? We have seen this over and over throughout history.

**Monetary Theory** suggests that different monetary policies can benefit nations depending on their unique set of resources and limitations. It is based on core ideas about how factors like the size of the money supply, price levels and benchmark interest rates affect the economy.

It would be awesome if it was a sB  the lower case "s" tied into the bitcoin symbol.  that would be super awesome.

I'm totally looking for a symbol to add to my menu in my restaurant… If you like my video… (it's only a rough draft before I make a better one)… Let's team up.  Did anyone come up with a graphic yet?  I was going to come up with a video called… "They're called Satashies, Damn IT"  I just need to shorten up the video to get the point across… maybe strengthen my point of view a little better.

@_date: 2013-12-27 17:32:30
It's more about people like me… I say I take bitcoin at my restaurant… news media comes in and does interviews… it's free advertising.  I want my customers to start thinking in bitcoin.  As it gets more expensive… it will stabilize.  When it gets to that point… I want my customers to be clear on the cost… vs changing the decimal place.  Did you see the part about the Capital Gains tax part?  I think most will want to come and spend their investment money on food and drinks… or what ever they wish.  It's too easy for the IRS to monitor their profits when they convert it to cash.
@_date: 2013-12-27 20:54:22
Because it varies for the day… I give a 25% off for using bitcoin… I have about 1 or two people a day right now.  Mostly… I just want to increase awareness… So, Lets say… I have a happy hour… I do 400k sBTC.  I'll actually do it up on a chalk board in the fashion Domestics @ 400k sB (and the B is in the shape of the bitcoin emblem)  That's about $2.88 a beer right now.  It's actually been pretty mellow right now… and I find that I can keep it at that price range for the whole happy hour.  I set the price at the beginning of the special… and even if it goes up or down… it's like thinking about a nick to a dime in changed value based on fluctuation.  
I guess the point is… when I do my numbers for the business… software related… it's just easier for me to calling it one unit vs something else.  I have to keep the books straight… and changing around the decimal point doesn't work for me.
You would be surprised how much work goes into accounting applying this concept.
@_date: 2013-12-29 22:50:51
I scribbled a few thoughts on my dry erase board... Want me to email it to you?  When I redo my video... If I can find that one symbol that works... We could be a trend setters... I have in mind a bunch of videos that cover so many topics for why satoshies are the answer.
