You’re basing this over a 5 day period ??? In 5 months he will be pissed he didn’t ... you dodged a blank pal

Depends what alts you have in your portfolio; if you diversify wisely you’ll always sleep soundly...

Baking power? Squeeze me? Welcome to the party, pal! OK I get it man. Yes the recent ATH for BTC was lofty indeed, so you whispered words of advice. That’s cool dude. You saw the market continue to correct. I just don’t think he dodged a bullet...
does it really matter if it’s @ 20k or 15k or 11.5k, where it currently sits? 
Sure, now is a good time to buy unless you FUD your way through life. But you can also wait forever. You can analyze forever. You can give and listen to good or bad advice forever, You can do nothing forever. Meanwhile, it goes up, it goes down - but it appreciates over time... so why not get in while you can, just stay away from those ATHs when adding to your stack.
