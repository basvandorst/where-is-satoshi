You're correct. I still use gdax to buy ethereum (now maybe BCH) from my bank acct,  then immediately transfer to binance to do all my trading

If it's not a stock (I agree), and the price doesn't matter (I somewhat agree), what is it then? It must surely have some utility then, no?

Then what? In your scenario eventually the only people who have BTC are hodlers who refuse to sell. Sure, the occasional BTC that does get sold will go for ridiculous amounts of money, but what good is that? It will become [this]( Don't get me wrong. I hold BTC as well as several other cryptos, but the end game is for it to be a usable currency and do away with government-backed fiat currency, not a status symbol.

You could also get BTC privately. Sell some shit on Craigslist and ask for btc or have someone you trust buy it for you and pay them cash

You don't have to do any verification on binance as long as you're not planning on withdrawing more than 2btc worth a day
*They don't have a fiat onramp though (so I still use coinbase/gdax for this purpose)

On what planet are you OK with spending $1.50 to send $3?

This is best ELI5 I've ever read. Not even being sarcastic

Sure,  I'll accept BTC as payment for any of the number of things I have listed on Craigslist or OfferUp. Buyer pays the fee,  and doesn't receive item until payment clears. LOL
