It's strange that they use the BTC ticker for Bcash when everyone else uses BTC for bitcoin and BCH for Bcash. It's part of the 'subversion' this post is referencing. There is an intentional campaign to deceive/mislead individuals into thinking that Bcash is actually Bitcoin.

Thanks, this clears things up :)

Depends how much you have. 
More than $3000? Get a hardware wallet imo. 
Also worth looking a desktop wallet as a less-secure but cheaper alternative. I've never used one, but I've heard good things about Electrum. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:13:43
Yeah well, I think you should set some goals for yourself. Decide on a strategy that works best for you. 
Are you looking to earn a certain dollar amount? 
Are you looking to earn a certain percentage?
Do you just want to get some money in and see what happens?
Do you just want to be part of the space and come along for the ride?
I can't tell you how long you should stay in for, it depends on what you're comfortable with. 
Lets say you have 500$ sitting around and you want to invest it. If you think bitcoin will continue to go up over the long term, a good strategy could be to put 100$ in every 2 weeks. After 2.5 months you'll have a 500$ investment, and then you can keep an eye on the price and figure out if/when to get out. 
Maybe your strategy could be to double your initial investment (turn that 500$ into 1000$) and then pull the original 500$ out so you make up your investment, and now you'll have 500$ invested that you didn't have before.

@_date: 2017-12-06 17:21:12
I mean, maybe, but this line 


is ridiculous. The story is *plausible* and easily explainable by 'lucky and stupid'. Not only that, but we *know* that there was a ton of fear around the Bcash scenario and that *many* btc holders switched over.
Not to mention that this is just a story. He's not asking for donations or something. What motivations would OP have for lying? This is already an anti-Bcash sub.
 Occam's razor. 'The story is real' is, in my opinion, the more likely explanation.
@_date: 2017-12-27 11:24:43
I'm not sure what you mean by this. You can think of it as the miners just getting some extra btc added to their wallets. It's the same as you or I having btc in our wallets.
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:47:13
I don't know about this news specifically, but...
"Difficulty" refers to how hard it is to mine a block. Greater difficulty = more time/energy required to mine. Mining is the process of assembling a big list (block) of transactions and trying to get them approved on the blockchain, so if the difficulty increases, it means more energy is required to process transactions. 
Bitcoin is already pretty bad for transactions right now. It costs like 20$ in network fees to make a single transaction because there are so many more requests being made than the miners can process. So...
Altcoins, and specifically Bcash, advertise themselves as solutions to this problem. 
When the problem gets worse, the solutions seem even more desirable, hence the Bcash pump. 
However... Roger Ver is absolute scum and I would never touch Bcash for even one second.
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:38:48
Hmm I think you're not understanding exactly how investing works. 
The idea is with 100$ you'll buy 0.007 btc or so today. 
In 6 months from now, that 0.007 btc will hypothetically be worth 300$. 
At that time, you'll sell your investment and receive 300$ for it, meaning 200$ profit. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:02:58

Hey, Canadian here. The best way I've found is to use QuadrigaCX to cash out. 
Send your coins from coinbase -&gt; quadriga, sell your coins for CAD on quadriga, then withdraw CAD via bank wire or etransfer. It's very easy.

Nope. It would have been irresponsible of me to recommend my family invest in something they didn't understand/believe in. 
Perhaps I should have encouraged them to take a *good* look at the technology, but I'm not sure how I could have done that without acknowledging that in the end it really is just a gamble.
@_date: 2017-12-27 11:00:06
Fees go to the miners. 
A miner's job is primarily to gather a bunch of transactions (a block) and put them on the blockchain. But blocks aren't big enough to fit all of the transactions happening at a given time, so the miners have to pick and choose which transactions to include in their blocks. 
So as a user, you can provide an incentive for the miners to include your transaction in their block. That's what a transaction fee is. It's essentially a tip/bonus for the miners so they are incentivized to process your transactions as quick as possible. 
You may or may not know that the bitcoin reward halves every 4 years. At first it was 50btc per block, then 25btc per block, and now it's currently 12.5btc per block. Eventually, as the reward keeps halving, there will be a very small reward per block and the miners will rely on transaction fees to earn a majority of their income.
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:59:30
Personally I would just put the 100$ in and wait for 6 months, and reevaluate then :) 
100$ isn't a game changing investment, so as long as you'll still be able to pay rent this month I say just put it in and wait for it to become 300$.

Don't take this personally, but I don't think you should invest in *anything* until you understand the basics of investing, which you clearly do not.
Yes it's wrong. The price of one bitcoin is currently $14,900 USD. You should be capable of figuring out how much bitcoin you can buy with $100 :p 
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:23:13
I'll interpret your question as 'What happens if the mempool doesn't clear soon?'. 
No problem, we'll give the technology some more time to move smoothly into mass adoption. The scaling issue is one that's been around for some time, and while there is new pressure on bitcoin to accelerate its dev timeline, it's important not to jump to a mediocre solution. 
Bitcoin is a robust giant. It'll get there. And in case you're a Bcasher (the tone of your question gives it away, of course), Bcash disappears the minute Bitcoin's mempool clears.
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:06:17
It's about 14.5k right now, so $100 now would become $300 at around 45k.

Don't take this the wrong way, but these designs are doing some fundamental things wrong. 
With A, B, and C the square corners of the rectangles don't match the round design of the circle bitcoin logo. 
With D and E, the serif "I" doesn't match the sans-serif font used in the Bitcoin logo, and the size of the "I" is disproportionate.  
Using solid black is also a mistake, for all of the designs. Even the text in the Bitcoin logos for D and E isn't black - it's an off black, specifically

I'm on my laptop right now so it's tough for me to tell, but there looks to be a sell wall of about 150btc at $7000, yeah. It's big but not huge. Also, a lot of the sells you'll see in the order book are put up by bots, who then move their positions when the market fluctuates. These bots are the same reason you might see huge orders (60-300btc) pop in and out of the order book.

Good straw man, but one of the biggest reasons people are attracted to cryptocurrencies is to get away from a 'rigged game'. BCH seems like a very rigged game to many of us.

Tether is used to trade all cryptos because of its 'backing' by the USD. For all intents and purposes, it acts like a cryptocurrency version of the USD, thus the name 'Tether' as in 'Tethered' to the US dollar. 
If the crypto version of the USD goes down then it (could) seem like the whole crypto market is going down, so people thought "better safe than sorry" and sold to fiat.

100% agree with the second part, but I wouldn't really characterize what's been happening as resistance. 
There was resistance at 8pm EST on the 13th, but since then we've just consolidated around 5575, which makes me think that people are just being cautious at that price level. Now that nothing bad has happened people are dipping their toes back in and I think we'll see a good rise for the next few weeks :)

What I said was: Roger Ver (his reputation, character, past actions) is a liability to BCH. 
Surely you can see the difference between that and "the morality of your leader determines who comes out on top every time". 
You added in morality. You implied determinism. You reduced it to absolutes.
How you think it was intellectually honest to spin my argument of "Roger Ver is a liability" to "success is always determined by morality" is beyond me.

Entirely different contexts. "Bitcoin was criticized and it survived" is a really bad, low resolution argument that you can't use to dismiss criticism in general. 
The criticisms against BCH aren't criticisms against *the idea of cryptocurrencies* like the criticisms you're referring to. They're criticisms about a verify specific coin for specific reasons.

Look up a 'bitcoin mining basics' video. You don't 'mine' individual transactions, you 'mine' blocks. 
So sure you could build blocks out of just your transactions, but the chance that you'll successfully mine those blocks with the equipment you have is almost zero.

@_date: 2019-05-08 06:12:52
No, each coin cannot be individually traced. Your intuition is correct - if they could be traced then how would fractions work?
The only thing you can trace are amounts.
If you spend 5 btc in a few different transactions, all people will see is, say, "1 btc went here, 2 btc went here, 0.5 btc went here, 1.5 btc went here". If you follow the amounts it's *like* tracing the btc, and often you can reason about the 'origins' of certain 'coins' based on the amounts transferred.
