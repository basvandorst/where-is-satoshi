I personally don't think so. First off, to do these micro payments one first needs to put his or her funds into a channel (something like a checking account) which requires an actual on chain transaction, thus requires miners. Then all minor transaction can simply happen there. In my eyes these are all the transactions that don't need to be duplicated on a global ledger. Also these are the transactions that we currently don't see directly on chain either (thus miners are not really missing out here). Then for bigger transactions I imagine people would still prefer on chain transactions without dealing with opening an closing a lightning channel, which will again still require miners. 
Tldr; smaller transactions that currently don't really exist will happen in a lightning channel, which will still require some miners input. Bigger transactions will keep happening on chain directly.
Just my 2 cents though!

I think it's quite hard to do a non-custodial lightning wallet on an iOS device. Since on iOS they are quite restrictive with scheduling background tasks. The only way afaik to properly do this is to send a push notification to the iOS device once in a while, but (unless you run your own server) doing that is of course not really non-custodial. 
Maybe get an android phone? :D
-- also: please correct me if I'm wrong! ;)

Feel free to checkout my app! 
If you buy an watch running Android Wear 2.0 you can add your portfolio to any watch face using the complication feature :).
PS. Apple watch version is also in the works!

I believe Andreas mentions something that might solve this issue in his book. It would require a little bit of input from you every x years but it would be completely non custodial. Basically you send the Bitcoin to a multi sig wallet/contract that is spendable by 2 private keys, one owned by you and the other by the person you want to leave your Bitcoin to. With one catch: their address is time locked so it's not spendable for another X years. Before the x years expire you would simply transfer the funds to basically the same multi sig contract but you reset the time lock with another X years.
I'm probably using the wrong terms here, so please dive into Andreas Antonopoulos book on Bitcoin for a much better explanation but hopefully the basic concept is clear :).

Might be a bit of a hassle but you could try doing it through an Android emulator on your PC (e.g. genymotion)

Why would you think that xD, or are you just trolling? With all these smartwatches running apps these days this is definitely possible. Shameless promo but I for example built a similar app for Android Wear a while ago:  so I'd say this looks very legit! More on topic: very awesome, love the 'brand name' wordplay especially :D

You don't happen to own a smartwatch running Android Wear by any chance?

Built this a couple of days ago, for Android Wear 2.0 watches specifically. Planning to add some more features/currencies to it at some point! It is paid though but I have to find a way to invest in BTC somehow! ;)

Completely understand! YouTube video should be in the play store listing but otherwise find it here!

No alarm support yet, but I've been building an android wear watchface to do just that as well :D.
