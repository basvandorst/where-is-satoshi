My friend, I see that you are new to this game. If you are based in the US, please be aware that any trade from an asset to fiat will register as a taxable event. Please do consider that and calculate any profits or losses with the tax rate in mind.

i don't believe this. how?!
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:07:15
just like how your home country can get nuked any time if certain things happened. don't be silly and dismiss that possibility! you should have your things packed and be ready to move any minute now.

A fork is equivalent to an alt. The process of building the infrastructure, a development team, some traction, a cult (if you will) is the same. Now that hedging is an option for Bitcoin miners, they have a safety net and more confidence and hence, less incentive to mine an alt. Until the day alts officially have a market for futures trading, it still carries the same risk as mining Bitoin pre-CME.

99.9%? Are you on drugs my friend?
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:08:29
The fundamentals now versus the time it was 8-9k are different.
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:05:25
You’re absolutely correct. Futures trading creates stability and ultimately predictable income for the miner. The risk of now mining a fork or even an alt is greater than ever.

great read. thanks for sharing
@_date: 2014-02-26 17:57:53
So you started off by stating Bitcoin is a scam without any knowledge of its real, practical uses. Nice.

Bitcoin is a covert operation launched by the Russian Government to devalue the US dollar, leading to an inevitable future global financial world war that will eventually collapse all first world countries, allowing Putin to seize the world's largest banks. Spearheaded by the most elite minds of the KGB, the Bitcoin project is a highly complex weaponization of financial, social, and technological tools that will enslave citizens to the blockchain. There's a reason Trump, a puppet of Russia, has not expressed any contrarian position to Bitcoin. With him as USA's leader again after the next election cycle, expect Bitcoin's value to skyrocket and slowly take over the dollar. Then and there is when Satoshi Nakomoto (Mother Russia) will awaken and make micro transactions that can send tidal waves to the global financial system.

Yes they do. You’re an idiot. Keep bag holding your worthless crypto portfolio that’s probably down 90% from last year.

The price of a Bitcoin, Litecoin, stock is based on perception, or one's willingness to sell at a specific price. Based on this fundamental aspect, zero-sum game principles, or "Cold maths" do not apply to cryptocurrency. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:06:11


You do realize the dot-com bubble was approximately 1.5 Trillion right? Bitcoin is nowhere near that. In fact, the entire crypto market is just around ~$300B.
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:14:18
You read it out of context. Gambling with crypto is not as risky as gambling at a casino. However, to hedge against your own assets at this magnitude (your own home) should be classified within the likes of gambling at a casino; i.e., putting all your eggs in one basket.
@_date: 2019-10-03 11:44:40
Those buying Bitcoin today expect a 10x return in a few months so they can dump onto the greater fool? What a joke.
@_date: 2019-10-03 20:30:02
Fucking lol.
The value in holding a bluechip stock is the dividends it pays. Are people really this ignorant?

So someone who presumably, for the last 40 years, has contributed to a low risk, long term investment portfolio, decided it was okay to risk everything (with the the knowledge of early withdrawal penalties) for a "cryptoasset" that hasn't been proven to provide any real life value?
You're a fucking god damn right that isn't believable. This isn't a matter of conforming to views -- it's common sense. You practically would be a fucking idiot if you actually believe this laughable anecdote.
@_date: 2018-03-30 19:46:01
Ah a Bitcoin skeptic’s wet dream. Quit your bullshit.

your advice to 'live a little' is besides the point. the market behaves the way it does for a reason and because you are an outlier, it does not mean the market should behave or think the same way you do

My advice is take the job. Please do not rely on bitcoin ever taking over real money.
