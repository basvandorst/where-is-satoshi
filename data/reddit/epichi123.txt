Yeah hopefully they do that. Although imo, Bitcoin isn't ready for Mass adoption yet. Don't get me wrong, I definitely support the use of crypto. But until it's at least as fast as a credit card to process a transaction, it's fixing one problem (centralization) and introducing another (transaction time). Even if it took only a minute to confirm a transaction, that's a minute of just waiting to see if the payment goes through. And I'm not shilling Bitcoin Cash either, because neither BTC nor bch are ready.

Ok sorry my bad. How would a decentralized version of such a system work?
@_date: 2018-06-24 07:40:32
This is what Google is for
@_date: 2018-06-28 09:07:56
How would it work if it was decentralized?
Also what do you mean not even a blockchain?
@_date: 2018-06-03 19:56:10
What are these services?
@_date: 2018-06-03 19:50:13
It is much too soon
@_date: 2018-06-12 14:36:47
This is actually really awesome! I hope ln succeeds. But just saying, there are cryptos like nano that have no fees at all

Definitely looks interesting

Just looked into FuzeX, and if they can pull it off it'll be amazing
@_date: 2018-03-23 00:46:34
And it's only for EUR? No support for either USD or CAD?
@_date: 2018-03-23 00:44:24
How long does it take to convert some BTC and load it into the card?
@_date: 2018-03-23 00:45:12
Is the shift card the only option for real-time conversion?
@_date: 2018-03-23 07:43:48
Ok that could work fairly well then. But it'd be a pain to go through the process of loading the card every time I want to make a purchase.
@_date: 2018-03-23 01:24:34
Ok thanks
@_date: 2018-03-23 01:06:32
Ah ok gotcha. Does it require any identity verification, such as submitting a government issued ID? As far as I can tell, the only requirement is to submit name, phone, email, address, and date of birth?

Check out hitfilm express, it's fairly decent free editing software
@_date: 2018-07-22 00:33:31
Is it really that significant of a raise in usage of internet, storage, etc?
@_date: 2019-09-01 04:17:20
It's not the size of your holdings that matter, but how you use it
@_date: 2018-07-22 00:29:39
Well there is, it would increase fees and raise the maximum tps would it not?
