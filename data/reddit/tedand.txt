Bitcoin is the second option, is called "Bitcoin Core" and has a black logo...
@_date: 2018-05-14 07:54:51
This is great news indeed. I believe it is huge SEO wise, as there are now 2 back-links less toward this site from a page strongly associated to bitcoin.
I am glad I contributed a little with my previous posts.
@_date: 2018-05-04 17:49:14
they just removed it! Looks like this post was usefull. hope it holds this time.
@_date: 2018-05-28 08:18:05
Is it not whatever, not only this post creates a duplicate, it also gives credit to the guy who ripped off the original post.

To illustrate my point, a user just asked on /btc where to buy BTC. He was advised to buy BCH instead.. It is just sad at this point.  /btc/comments/8mlhzo/need_advice_on_safest_ways_to_buy_btc/
@_date: 2018-05-04 17:46:11
We did it guys, thank you very much for sharing the message. It appears they removed the link. There is still one to remove indeed: "Message Board 2" goes to forum.bitcoin dot com
@_date: 2018-05-14 07:47:07
The bcash vehicles are probably slower to reflect the fact that there should be 32 lanes (after the hard fork). Since there is still only 8 lanes, the author chose to make the vehicle 4 times slower. probably?
@_date: 2018-05-04 14:24:51
I was not aware they removed the link in the past. The fact they put it back proves they are participating in the disgusting marketing campaign led by Roger Ver and Co. This is hurting Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies as a whole. I will never use CMC again and will label it as a fraudulent website until they fix this. (please don't write links towards bitcoin dot crom or cmc dot com, it will improve their page rank in search engines).
@_date: 2018-05-28 13:59:54
I know. Still, it is now nothing but a bitcoin cash chill forum, so they should rebrand everything or move somewhere else.

I'm good with this post being the most popular on r/bitcoin as long as the top comment gives credit to the original author. Guys please upvote comments that link to barneytheboi's tweet

Yes same deceptive methods than bitocin dot com website: attracting people who think this is a bitcoin's site then brainwhash them that bcash is bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-05-28 08:29:46
The sub logo is also a Bitcoin logo. And in the sidebar it says "Bitcoin" everywhere, not "Bitcoin Cash"...

Keep giving Bitcoin visibility! Love your work
@_date: 2018-06-12 07:48:13
The point is banks and governments can very easily destroy bitcoin's adoption by suppressing the price, while getting rich in the process (which is just the cherry on the cake for them, because they can print all the fiat they want).

Yeah, I should have changed the title for the reddit post. I am not the author of the medium article for info. I posted because I think it is an important matter for the future of Bitcoin.

By routting one single lightning torch, he can make 8750 sats. Y'alls node have 0.25% routing fees + 1sat. That is the highest I have seen yet.
@_date: 2019-02-19 21:38:53
Yall's is the first place some people go when they set up their node. So they open a direct channel despite the high routing fees that this node applies.

THat's in part why I replied "nice troll" and (get downvoted).
Also how can the op be so "new to this" and understand that bacsh is a totally different crypton since it is sold as a Bitcoin v2 on bitcoin dot con. I find it suspicious
@_date: 2019-01-10 07:25:47
Nice troll

8% fees is huge, but wire transfers are so slow, it can take 3 days on week-ends. Bitcoin price can move more than 8% during that time.
@_date: 2019-09-29 19:16:36
price will tank either way

Are there other options already for buying with visa and mastercard, worldwide? If this is the first, very bullish IMO
@_date: 2019-09-30 06:59:19
@_date: 2018-04-26 10:11:59
To be fair, they are actually offering both options: BCH and BTC, in that order. New people wondering what the hell is "core" and "cash", will click on the information link and will get served the misleading arguments that Bitcoin "core" cannot send worldwide transactions, and that "cash" is actually the newest, better working version of Bitcoin. This is BS.

Thank you for your proposition and recommendation. Isn't there some SEO efforts we can collectively do to push a more legitimate page as well?

You may have missed my point here. I am the one signalling the practices of bitcion ,com website with this thread. I am not excusing their methods in any way! I was just adding a precision to my post title, in anticipation to possible reactions.

One year ago we were in euphoria phase, scammers were impatient and screamed that LN would not come soon enough. LN would not work. Here we are now, Roger.
