BTC-E (through metatrader4 app), Okcoin, 796, BitVC, BTCchina - use any of these exchanges and you can enter a short or long and even use leveraged trading. Bit mind you that anytime these exchanges can follow the path of Gox.

he's a PR representative of Bitfinex
@_date: 2016-08-07 13:39:48
I think he meant bitcoin as an ecosystem, in which case he's right.
@_date: 2016-08-08 08:06:18
I think people are overly optimistic when they think a company can just issue shares like that. I think legal action against bfx is inevitable, and that even if no one files any complaint, this is going to be from regulators.
@_date: 2015-06-05 20:03:21
They also own shitload of decent bitcoin domain names. I think they're in for the long haul.

In crypto this is called pulling a max keiser :D :D

Yup, same here. My doctor told me that I might be able to use FIAT for a couple more years, but most probably not any longer.

"and only close them when i've made profit"
Are you being serious here?!
@_date: 2014-09-17 11:27:54
The more miners would join the strike, the more it would get profitable for those who stay. So the answers is no. In case all miners would stop mining, yes the network would freeze, but then you could again start mining on your CPU as the difficulty would drop to zero.
@_date: 2014-09-29 17:42:54
That's like offering a Huawei to someone waiting for an iPhone :D

Both of these technologies are about the third world I guess, they have no way of using itunes, netllix and stuff, so they just use torrents because it works flawlessly all around the globe.
@_date: 2014-05-15 10:29:13
This isn't about storing bitcoins anywhere, this is about converting them to fiat and storing the money in fiat, so I'm not sure what use would there be for multisig wallets.
@_date: 2014-12-13 22:56:44
umm, you can do this already by backing up your seed, in Mycelium for instance. When you lose your phone you just restore the wallet from the seed..

You know what? This is actually like really going to moon. I mean look at us, it takes a year to prepare everything and then it's just a matter of couple of blinks (well, not literally) and you're heading back down. Some missions even fail. I guess 2014 bubble is Apollo 13 so far. Or is it? :)

This is why some altcoins are integrating Kimoto well diff retargetting. Not because of the strike risk but simply for the case of the network beimg suddwnly abandoned.
@_date: 2014-12-28 15:05:38
I see, well then it makes sense. But what about the 'access to local storage' permission? I know it's most probably legit but as someone mentioned here in the comments a lot of people will nope right out of there.

For those who are curious I guess we're here:

I'm buying through localbitcoins online, i actually never used it with cash, also i don't know where you live but here in eastern europe the premium is around 3% because of competition.

@_date: 2014-09-08 19:17:31
To buy something on eBay with bitcoin obviously? What's so hard to understand. Not everybody hates Paypal, I've never had an issue, hundreds of payments to china, usa, europe and not a single bloody issue. I'm sorry you have bad experiences but you're a minority.

This. If bitcoin really is that great as we envision it to be, Apple will sooner or later pull the ban, because that's what huge corporations usually don't do - refusing profit from ideological reasons. That will happen at the time Apple will see drop of smartphone and tablet sales in comparison with competition. Or even sooner.

I still don't understand the hate for Paypal anyway, they're good in what they do - being an escrow service for international trade. I got my money saved by paypal more than couple of times, which wouldn't be possible with bitcoin(only with 3rd party escrow).

@_date: 2015-01-28 10:30:34
Trustless. Well, it isn't. Even trezor isn't completely trustless in the end. Unless you check the particular PCB and microchip that is shipped to you there's still a chance that there's some form of hidden backdoor. You have to up your security paranoia filter one level haha
@_date: 2015-01-13 15:33:37
Yeah, wouldn't it be for traders people would buy it up immediately to 100k$ a bitcoin.

@_date: 2015-04-09 18:12:11
This is trully an echo chamber here. Paypal is escrow service for buyers/sellers not a remittance tool. That's why they have such fees. Where's the equivalent escrow for bitcoin?

Nice, hi there. First impressions? I've bounced of the login screen and than of the empty directory, but It's quite late here, will give it a second look. 
@_date: 2015-04-08 14:50:45
But ease of use is not a superficial layer at all. I think that fancy UI's is exactly what bitcoin ecosystem needs right now. Yeah, I use Mycelium myself, I only wanted to know whether there's anything else better looking.
@_date: 2015-03-29 11:22:18

Do you really think global economy can work without reputation system/escrow/mediator? For some things you simply have to have a middle man. I'm not defending this particular site, but this stance in general which seems to be widely dismissed by bitcoin community.
@_date: 2015-03-22 11:30:06
I'd say it's definitely more difficult to get rid off (without losing %).
@_date: 2015-03-28 20:57:12
I love how you jumped to making conclusions. Getting 50% in bitcoin doesn't have to equal investing 50% in bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-03-27 13:14:22
Trezor is basically a cold wallet that has the advantage that you can even send your coins securely. With Mycelium entropy you still have to redeem the paper wallet at some point so there's a chance of the device being compromised - but to be honest we're talking super paranoia here.
@_date: 2015-03-06 10:06:40
I personally didn't. Trezor is secure by design, not thanks to a security chip.
@_date: 2015-03-10 09:32:00
so you would actually would have to want to? Sense it makes not. 
@_date: 2015-03-17 22:02:37
Because there's no demand whatsoever?
@_date: 2015-03-29 18:15:31
Yeah, it's true, but if they manage to change the UI design of the rest i'll be more than happy.
@_date: 2015-03-19 18:19:43
Those automated systems ain't gonna program themselves (well at least until some point). Anyway there will be huge increase in demand for other services. It's as if Ford's breakthroughs in mass production destroyed jobs in the long run.

You don't necessarily have to buy it, I for one get half of my salary in bitcoin. The time will come.
@_date: 2015-03-12 09:22:55
it's the same shit in the end, payments are reversible
@_date: 2015-03-20 18:51:42
a) I don't think we are able to predict complexity of systems that are going to be developed, so there just might be need for exponentialy more even good programmers
b)all I'm saying that there might popup number of various services which we simply cannot forsee
c)so the ratio of employed people is lower than 100 years ago because of machines?
d)i'm not a pesimist, i only think that peple were never ever much successful in predicting future, perhaps we will live in society with basic income but i don't think it can be so easily decided to be the best solution
@_date: 2015-03-22 14:16:19
Oh, nevermind, I didn't understand the title and thought it was against bitrated and jumped to making conclusions.
@_date: 2015-03-24 13:03:20
Mycelium Entropy is just for printing out paper wallets, you can recover them to another wallet like Mycelium for android. Trezor on the other hand is a full wallet allowing you to receive and send transactions.
@_date: 2017-07-26 16:18:04
Contact your bank and tell them you're suspecting that you sent money to an illegal institution, they might be able to reverse it but it takes quite a lot of time and maybe it's already too late...
@_date: 2015-03-12 16:30:04
wow, really? In Czech Republic wire transfers reverse if you sneeze improperly.
@_date: 2015-03-29 18:17:36
Perhaps they worked on it since then, for me it was instant. I even went like "oh wait, that it?"
@_date: 2015-02-15 14:55:37
what kind of cold wallet is it if it can be hacked, geebus
@_date: 2015-03-27 16:11:04
Cool, i get 50% in bitcoin.

@_date: 2015-02-05 11:08:00
Yes, the other option would be to remember the seed, but I wouldn't recommend that.
You can also go for some sort of multisig, so for instance one key would be stored at your parent's/etc. house while the other would be with you.
There should be more options for multisig soon i think. A lot of wallets is working on these solutions.
