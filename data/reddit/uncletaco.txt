I've created a riddle for each word in my mnemonic and stored the solution in a safe box at my bank. Upon my death I'll will that box to my grandchildren who'll follow the clues and learn each word of the mnemonic. Hopefully they'll recover my wallet as well as learn some things about me in the process that will let them know that Pa-paw may have been an asshole, but he loved them.
