The block wasn't mined with our reference software but we're reaching out to pools to see how we can help. 
We always advise to merge mine on Testnet before going in production and have pools successfully creating RSK merge mined blocks for a year now.
We're thankful to pools and miners supporting RSK and will put all our resources to help them avoid this errors in the future.

I think different security models will appeal to different audiences. Regarding the token used as fuel is not that relevant as both platforms have a dynamic pricing model for contract execution. In terms of functionality both platforms will offer similar features.

RSK has been running in Beta since January 3rd 2018. The hashing power has been steadily growing since then recently reaching 20% of the hashing power of the Bitcoin Network: [stats.rsk.com]( The whitelisting to create smartBitcoins is there to protect the community until the network is properly tested and security is hardened. Once that process is finished the whitelisting will be removed and the network will move out of Beta. Everything aside the peg is fully open and the whole platform is open source.

RSK does not increase Bitcoin's surface of attack in anyway. It is a second layer (separate Blockchain) on top of Bitcoin that is secure by the Bitcoin Network via merge mining and uses bitcoin as currency via a 2way peg.

The form is to get whitelisted / get smartBitcoins while the Mainnet is in Beta after it goes out of Beta you will be able to freely create smartBitcoins. Everything else is already free and open sourced.

The cost per transaction in RSK is 0.8 cents USD (less than a cent).
You can calculate that by multiplying the basic transaction costs (21000 gas), by current minimum gas price (0.0000000000593 wei per gas [stats.rsk.co]( ), and then multiplying that by the current price of Bitcoin (\~6440 USD/BTC). 
I think that's cheap enough for most use cases. This is possible thanks to the fact that RSK creates an additional revenue stream for miners without creating any additional cost.

Kudos to you Greg! We need clear rules not prohibition.
Big hug,

Would be great to have an English version or subtitles.

This can be achieved with pegs to other blockchains and multi currency P2P exchanges on the Rootstock side
@_date: 2016-06-27 15:43:58
This is exactly how it works
@_date: 2016-06-27 15:47:55
There is no direct correlation between the initial funding of BTC and the release, as long as you have the amount of RTC in your power you can release them partially or in total at any time

Excellent lets keep in touch.

Phase 1 is based on the federation, Phase 2 is based on trust minimized 2way peg with Drivechain. We already wrote and coded Drivechain BIP so it's only a matter of getting it on the Bitcoin roadmap.

The idea behind Rootstock is to provide Smart Contract capabilities in an alternative economic incentive and security environment then Ethereum does. Is not about functionality but about how the contract execution is secured and what incentives receive those who secure it plus leveraging on Bitcoin network effects. There are other people working on scaling Bitcoin. I personally think that although scaling Bitcoin is important is not its goal to become THE payment network but THE store of value as you state.

The rootcoins are actual bitcoins locked in a wallet on the Bitcoin blockchain that is why there is not proprietary token and therefore no crowdsale although I love those things :)
@_date: 2015-10-19 17:20:45
Thank you for your summary, very useful :)
@_date: 2015-10-07 22:08:23
I wouldn't say is better, is different. In terms of programming capabilities both are the same. In terms of security and user base in Ethereum you relay on what the Ethereum community has and will build and in RootStock you depend on the Bitcoin ecosystem. Both will live side by side.
@_date: 2015-10-14 05:53:05
I agree is not about killing Ethereum, is about creating an alternative smart contracts platform with a different security model and economic incentives plus leveraging from Bitcoin network effect (both on the user base and the supporting industry)

Dear sjalq we have two solutions for different stages of maturity / usage of Rootstock and those combined will provide a secure environment until SPV proofs are implemented what we guess will happen within the next couple years. 
We are not looking for the perfect theoretical solution but for something that is good enough to make things happen. Many projects in the past failed trying to do [too much]( while simpler ones [succeeded]( we don't want to fall under the former category.
@_date: 2015-10-07 22:01:31
You are right this is a challenging project indeed and the team has been working in many aspects of it for over two years now.
@_date: 2015-10-19 16:59:06
Thank you BurnXCP, I absolutely agree that reputation is not enough and we are working hard to make sure that once we launch our platform is rock solid and includes the perspective of all the stakeholders in the Bitcoin ecosystem. 
@_date: 2015-10-14 05:38:00
Hi Adam! You are correct there are lots of improvements over Ethereum aside the obvious replacement of ether as fuel to run the contracts. We are building on the shoulders of giants and really appreciate all the work that you, Blockstream and Ethereum have done. Our philosophy is to share and contribute in anyway we can to foster the Blockchain ecosystem as a whole. Hope to be up to the task!

The website was not intended to communicate how the platform works what is properly explained on the white paper we shared with Nick Szabo and a few select others. The blog author make some pretty accurate assumptions about the inner workings of Rootstock that clarify the apparent conflicts.
For your nickname and comments I can see you are a big fan of Counterparty so I will seize the opportunity to state that Rootstock does not aim to be a threat to Counterparty or any other Smart Contract / Asset Tokenisation platform. 
We are trying to provide alternatives and solutions to some specific problems that are difficult to solve today like having thin clients for user issued assets which is one constrain for coloured coins. 
Depending on the scenario this might not be crucial therefore current platforms can offer a perfectly viable solution.
@_date: 2015-10-07 21:58:43
You are right on the spot, of course SPV proof is the way to go but until then a federated peg will suffice while incentives are not too high.
@_date: 2015-10-07 22:00:32
The VM is backwards compatible with Ethereum and you are right on the federated 2wp.
@_date: 2015-10-08 11:34:33
A well designed sidechain enables SPV clients to actually work with user issued assets something not possible when colouring bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-10-07 22:04:49
This brings full smart contracts capabilities to the Bitcoin network. Ethereum flexibility + Bitcoin security and network effect. The possibility of running business logic on a trust-less network are endless from creating a p2p financial system to running affinity programs.
