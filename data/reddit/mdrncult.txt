I see. 
Not financial advice, but If i were doing something similar I personally would loan more than what bitcoin is currently priced at with the intention of selling off during appreciation period to pay off interest and monthly payments. Sell off in order to eventually hold 1BTC

Just average out
@_date: 2019-07-12 19:27:41
Multiple dealerships accept bitcoin
Multiple stores that sell clothes and other goods and services accept bitcoin 
He’s just gonna lose. Make sure you rub it in later on.

That’s not a terrible attitude for how early we are in this journey...other investments I wouldn’t advise hahaha. 
I’m not gonna lie man...shits really tough sometimes. I just try not to look at it on these types of weeks

Appreciate your $10+ billion sell off for all of us who bought the dip 
You’ve done a great and noble deed
@_date: 2019-07-16 00:38:51
I can’t tell if it’s a buy or sell, but I know he doesn’t know the difference either
@_date: 2019-07-14 17:23:23
@_date: 2019-07-16 10:32:41
Yeah, you’re only gonna make the difference between total value and how much you invested. It’s a scam ��
@_date: 2019-07-30 22:12:12
This math is creative
@_date: 2019-07-16 23:10:23
I’m down like $15k ....and I’m not really in a position where that’s nothing to sneeze at. 
I still buy on all the big dips.

You’re better off doing a credit card with that crazy interest
@_date: 2019-07-26 00:40:24
Thanks for the nose dive
@_date: 2019-07-19 10:48:00
400k bitcoin is very realistic
@_date: 2019-07-19 16:46:58
This is actually one the funniest videos relating to crypto
@_date: 2019-07-19 16:41:47
It’s not worth proving a “no” to a “yes” 
You invest, you secure your bag. Let them miss the ride.
@_date: 2019-07-27 14:58:46
This is exactly why bitcoin isn’t far greater than the legacy system (first generation crypto). It’s still going to need a physical person with a physical contract. 
Third gen crypto’s will be able to create smart contracts to borrow, add on interest, crest guidelines and payment timelines and such.

@_date: 2019-07-12 19:37:29
Absolutely bat shit
@_date: 2019-07-27 15:02:16
It’s going to happen soon...always when the news talks about crypto....there’s a delayed turn to the downside. Over hype will always cause selling
@_date: 2019-07-24 21:21:48
Technically....you’re not converting that BTC to USD before transaction. 
Fine line...but eventually you’ll have to pay taxes once they write strict regulation (US)

The human still has to physically run on the big hamster wheel. So AI wouldn’t really help too much 
Could be a cool thing to download and install though.

No, it’s best if no one uses it
@_date: 2019-11-14 18:59:48
@_date: 2019-08-01 10:41:59
Remember when bitcoin was at $3500 USD and now we are floating above $9500? 
Perspective. We are in a bull market, it’s just not wild and exciting yet.
@_date: 2019-08-06 10:42:09
@_date: 2019-08-14 08:35:55
That’s all I do. Not only bitcoin though.

I called the CEO and he let me use his

I’d argue that the “biggest problem” is not the people who are participating in crypto, regardless of the intention
@_date: 2019-08-08 16:20:05
He’s not able to prove it...

I’ve seen this algo work in person, it works. Even ask the guy who made it, I ran into him at a bar once. Legit dude
@_date: 2019-09-26 14:05:59
I hope so
@_date: 2019-09-12 23:49:16
I’ll donate

Time to buy....
