Are you from the UK? Have you been paying attention to British politics VERY closely for the past 2 years while this idiot has been in charge? I wouldn't trust a word that comes out of her mouth. She went on for weeks that she would never announce a snap GE because it would destabilise the country, then guess what? She did EXACTLY that!

Just goes to show, it's not just media that manipulates shit, Google does too - I can point you to numerous things where she is nowhere near considering taking action against cryptos. Govt have been researching it for quite some time here, and the BoE has been doing work with numerous crypto companies, along with hoarding BTC since 2014....

Not when i'm specifically searching for a BBC article from 2014 with the headline including "Bank of England", "Bitcoin" and "hoarding"....

You've kind of just contradicted yourself comparing blockchain to apps - apps grow like wildfire because scalable infrastructure is there to cope..... blockchains do not have scalable infrastructure yet, and the knowledge behind keeping a blockchain secure is probably one hell of a lot more complicated than creating the internet....

Like the internet then...

Isn't the whole point of Bitcoin that it isn't regulated?
