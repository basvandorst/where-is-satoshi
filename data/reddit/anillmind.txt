Why is this on @_date: 2014-09-07 23:40:47
How? The internet provided a means of near instant communications with people all across the world, bitcoin is a currency. I'm not bashing bitcoin, I love it. I just don't see how its as big of an invention as the internet is. That's a bit pretentious IMO.

..how did bitcoin change the world the same way the internet did? 
@_date: 2014-09-05 16:27:59
I've heard WAY too many people ask me, "Wait, isn't bitcoin like illegal or something?"

It was a joke, and I'm a guy.

Okay but how does that change the world the way the internet did? That's like comparing the invention of the wheel to the invention of the newest, coolest looking tire.

I'm pretty sure 99% of drug transactions are still processed through fiat as well, just like everything fucking else. 3/10 attempt at karma whoring

1) Install vnsati
2) Install LAMP/LEMP
3) Inside your document root, place an index.php file like "&lt;?php $img = shell_exec("vnsati -s -i eth0 -o ./log.jpg"); ?&gt; &lt;img src="./log.jpg"&gt;"
4) Visit the URL
