This is just a proof of concept for an idea that we have been playing around with for using Bitcoin to vote for various aspects of life, a move towards something like consumer participative democracy.

You can expect a lot more Bitcoin innovations from Stellenbosch, South Africa in the near future. A lot of very talented people, including the FireID team, are working on a range of projects.

What would the implications be when moving Bitcoin in and out of the US? Does this imply import/export duties? And what about Bitcoin tipping? Would that be considered gifts, and what would the implications be?

A lot has happened since then, but from the synopsis the book seems to be about the history of Bitcoin. Therefore it would probably be a good way to get up to date on the 2009-2016 history of the community. If you weren't along for the ride since the beginning, it might be a good idea to read it for some background info on what is happening at the moment. The problem with looking for a book to get you up to date is that the industry is moving faster than anyone can write. 
I would recommend diving into some of Andreas Antonopoulos' videos on YouTube, especially the Q&amp;A ones. Community members ask the most relevant questions at any given time, and he has a great way of giving understandable and succinct answers. This gives you a nice TLDR of the community Zeitgeist at any point in time.

With the hefty entrance fee of R1,350 (US$117) it makes sense to hold it there. So much for being inclusive.
