There are tons of reporting requirements when doing cash transactions.  These apply if you are exchanging currency, buying diamonds, selling money orders or doing almost any other activity that will aid in washing funds.  He had tons of lawyers, was well aware of this, and was in charge of compliance for fuck sakes..  The fact these were being used for drugs was just icing on the cake.  He was violating the law well before that.

I don't understand what one has to do with the other.  Do they think if bitcoin takes off there won't be a banking system?  Its just a currency, people are still going to want loans for stuff and people will still want to invest the money they have into something.  If they want to take the stance that jews control all banking or whatever, bitcoin adoption would just mean they start controlling that too no?

non bit coiner here.  can you explain why?  I always understood the ultimate goal was to bring bitcoin more to every day life while maintaining the anonymility and decentralized nature.
If I am a retailer and you come in my shop to buy something, and I have no way to track you down later, your payment would have to be confirmed in seconds no?  same if you use an atm.  
if bitcoin ever moves off just a way to pay for some internet things it would seem highly likelly the vast majority of transactions would need near instant authentication to me.  Am I missing something?
