After you finish calling the suicide hotline, your next call should be to the national council on problem gambling at 1-800-522-4700 so you don't put yourself in this situation again.

I fail to see what this has to do with Bitcoin. This wouldn't be good for mining and it doesn't provide any extra security for storing your wallet.

It is a good thing that he didn't make the company legal because then you would be looking at jail time for doing what you did.  Your rep deserves to take a hit because of this stunt, however the community will probably make excuses for you.

Like I said they are not professionally ran so they are frequently down for long periods of maintenance. No conspiracy.

I believe that was just a BS explanation because if he told the truth then the shares he was trying to sell would have been worthless. 
| I knew Nefario was a terrible businessman and that his plans were stupid (which is why I was selling), but I didn't know he was this stupid. I wish I would have sold for 0.06 when I had the chance.

Many bitcoin operations are ran by people who have little to no experience running a business and often run it part time because they need to work a real job to pay the bills. It is no surprise that these businesses fail. There is no evidence that the government is shutting down bitcoin web sites.

Was it ever disclosed that the manager of the fund was a full time (college?) student with a part time job? How can people be so stupid as to invest hundreds and thousands of bitcoin with amateurs and scammers? The general public is not going to want anything to do with bitcoin as long as the bitcoin community keeps enabling this stuff.

It was a huge red flag when theymos tried to dump all of his shares in GLBSE on the 24th. Anyone who saw his post and kept any money in GLBSE or anything listed on GLBSE is stupid.
The whole Bitcoin security market is going to be a house of cards until a professional gets involved. There are too many amateurs and part-timers pretending to be experts. Also, the Bitcoin community has to start calling out these amateurs and part-timers to kept them accountable.  I can't believe there are people in that thread still making excuses for nefario. What a bunch of sycophants.

or he might also abuse his privileged access.
