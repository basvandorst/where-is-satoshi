I would be too scared shitless of making a mistake to move it all in one lump.

Is that going to allow them to place PayPal-style restrictions on what we can buy, though...?

Makes sense.

This so much. I agonized over it at 10k thinking it was going to correct but went ahead and pulled the trigger.
Now I’ve got a little more to invest and I’m agonizing again.

Since it seems impossible to log in to Coinbase and sell whenever there’s a big ATH... 
If I set a limit order to sell at a certain price, say 25k, will it execute even if Coinbase is inaccessible?
Don’t worry, just some. I’m still planning on hodling most of it.

Serious question that I still don’t understand. 
If there’s a finite amount of Bitcoin to be mined, and bitcoins are easily lost by people (hard drive failure, not backing up things, etc.), then why would the price of Bitcoin not just keep going up as the supply of Bitcoin shrinks?

Dumb gdax question maybe one of you can answer...
If I sell BTC at gdax, does the USD go straight to my bank account or does it go to my gdax account as a balance until I actually withdraw it?

Thank you. 
I really, *really* hate everyone saying this is just the same as all the times before. We don’t know that. All the other major crashes, BTC was still a useable currency. Right now it really isn’t and doesn’t look to be anytime soon. 
Not saying it *won’t* recover like all the times before (it very well may), but anyone who says it *definitely* will is not basing that on sound logic.
