Hello all.
Happy New year!
I have a simple question.
What will happen when the last block is mined?
@_date: 2018-01-09 21:43:08
I think you might be onto something here. Apparently the demand for BTC here in Australia is extremely high, in fact, upon further checking it appears the Australian exchanges all have very similar buy/sell prices. 
It is well known here in Aus the demand for BTC has exploded, there are banners on Coinspot and Cointree with similar "due to extremely high demand, application processes and ID verification may take days to complete"
I actually saw Coinspot has a two week minimum wait at the moment due to the demand. And that's just for verification of ID!

Great reply. And Cudos for "bitcoinia".

Hmm it's all very interesting, I'd like to see more about this, is it possible the entire crypto market can be manipulated this easily?
@_date: 2018-01-09 22:36:44
Oh thanks for this, I'm considering signing up to a number of Australian exchanges in order to 'chase' the best possible buy price. Even a small % of saving adds up long-term.

Why would they shut down, do they not still take fees for the TX it self?

Very good point, it's why I linked this article, I had a feeling it would spark a decent discussion.
This is also why I put "economists" in quotation marks. Because although these people are experts in there field of study (We can't deny that). 
Are they experts in crypto? My answer would be no, they are not. And sadly it appears most do very little research before writing an article.

Hey guys! Happy New Year all.
I have a pretty simple question (I'm guessing the answer won't be so sinple)
I am Australian, and I have recently signed up to an Australian BTC exchange.
I was going to purchase some bitcoin, like every time I make a purchase, I check the global markets for a medium price.
The global market showed the average price was approx 19k AUD, although on Cointree (the exchange I have signed up to) the BTC buy/sell price is 22/23k AUD.
Can anyone explain how the price can be 2-4k higher than the global medium?

I never once said my opinion of this article. Which in fact, I believe the "economists" who wrote it. Lack knowledge around cryptocurrency in general. 
Take your pitchfork someplace else mate. Friendly discussion zone here.
I linked this article purely for discussion.
And I'll finish this with your line, "good luck bud"

At the time of linking this article. It is currently the top and highest trending article for the day on the ABC website here in Australia. 
I have no affiliation with the ABC or any other news outlet. 
Maybe instead of downvoting and commenting with useless posts like "fud" or "lol" 
It would be nice to hear some thought out discussion from people here. 
Tell us why it's FUD, give us your insight.

Mr Satoshi, tear down this wall!

I'm a relatively new bitcoin user and I'd like to move my balance off the exchange I've been using, and into a more secure wallet.
Can anyone here recommend a safe and secure wallet for an android user or my pc?
I've been storing some of my coins on a paper wallet, do most wallets offer the option of "sweeping paper wallet"?
@_date: 2017-12-09 10:29:12
These kind of posts are really helpful to people like me who are new, and want to explore, and understand (or attempt to) the crypto-currency world.
Thank you.

Is this problem wide spread here in Australia?
Other than Twitter posts and those few sentences from Coinspot, I can't find any official statements from banks about freezing accounts.
I am with Cointree and have had no issues at all.
Buying or selling.
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:53:41
It's really disappointing, how can a transaction fee of almost 100% of the funds your transferring be real? 
I've sent a support ticket to Coinbsse, I'm not expecting to be refunded the fee amount.
But I would like to hear how they are justifying this. 
Edit: from some of the comments and a little research I've done. It seems best to avoid small transactions at the moment as the traffic/demand is high.

As a new user.
This post was very helpful.
I have now added 2 factor authentication.
I also told a few friends about this, and they also added the extra security (some of them didn't even know what 2 factor authentication was).

Thanks! I have purchased a ledger nano S hardware wallet, I'd just like to use something in between while I wait for shipping.
Thanks again, much appreciated.

This was fantastic, I walked into the meal room yesterday and it was on the news, a couple of guys said "don't they have security in there mines?" 
The lack of understanding or any sort of general knowledge regarding bitcoin or other cryptocurrency for that matter, is just becoming funny now.

I have purchased BTC from Cointree using Poli payment system. 
The payment went through as per normal with the 1-2 day transfer period depending on banks.
I'll update this comment if an issue arrises.

Hello all,
I am a new user of bitcoin, and as a gift I sent some to a relative for Christmas, I sent through $42 AUD of Bitcoin, and was charged a further $40 fee for transfer.
I sent the bitcoin from Coinbase exchange android App (I don't store coins on exchanges, so to anyone thinking, chill out.)
My question to the more experienced bitcoin users is, is this a normal fee price? Even at the moment with the fees etc being high?
Or is this Coinbase ripping me off? 
Edit: I have sent Bitcoin to my wallet from Coinbase before, and I was not charge anywhere near that percentage of fee. 
It's worried me now because how can I transfer funds from an exchange if the fee will basically bankrupt my account? 
This isn't a dig at bitcoin either, I'm a big believer of digital currency. Just seeking some information.

Just a question relating to 'ease of use' I hear people talking about how fantastic digital currency is because it's decentralised, unregulated and easy to use etc.
I've recently attempted to sign up at cointree and coinspot because they are both Australian.
I have to leave coinbase because transfer and purchase fees are extremely high. And sadly, being Australian, my purchase cap is maxed at $250 per week, even with a verified account! 
Upon creating accounts through cointree and coinspot, I was met with a rather interesting 'brick wall'.
Both these sites require you to verify an account before purchasing digital currency, that's fine, but here comes my questions of 'ease of use'.
The websites/exchanges require you to provide, photo ID or Passport ID, and a legal declaration, that being a hand written statement on a piece of paper, taking a photo of yourself holding said paper declaration, and then sending all this to people who you don't know. 
Not being regulated is fantastic, right?
And to finish all this, i was told it would take up to 2 weeks to verify my account.
Now, for a relatively patient person as my self, this process was a little frustrating, I've worked jobs where I've handled thousands of dollars in cash per night, and did not have produce such stringent requests for 'ID verification'.
I understand this is revolving around Australia's anti money laundering and terrorism funding laws. Which is also fine.
But as a relatively new 'investor'.
This entire process has soured my opinion of digital currency.
Does anyone think that in the future this process of purchasing and trading (or hopefully being able to one day actually use a digital currency like BTC to purchase goods/services) will become easier? 
And do people think it's appropriate to trust these sort of exchanges and unregulated services with highly private information?
