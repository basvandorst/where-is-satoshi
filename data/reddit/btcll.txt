Unfortunately rating systems are easily gamed through Sybil attacks.
The Bitsquare approach is to require a registration fee. Regardless of what checks are done, there is always going to be some risk for the user. Those risks can be managed in a variety of ways. I'm looking forward to more thought/discussion around this as the bitcoin community has been burnt so many times here (can anyone say Mt. Gox???).

If you think the concept of Bitsquare (decentralized p2p bitcoin to national currency exchange) has merit then I encourage you to give Bitsquare a go, despite it being Java. I'm sorry if it sounded like I was suggesting you switch to Java in general terms.
What are your main reservations about Bitsquare using Java?

That's great to hear! The Bitsquare WAN Party starts in 30 minutes if you want to join us and do a test trade. All the info is here:

This reminds me of what Satoshi said about Wikileaks using Bitcoin. Just because these purposes that are being attacked by corporations can use Bitcoin doesn't mean it will be a good thing for Bitcoin when they use it.

I can't believe that they allow all the data to come off the card unencrypted so easily. The banks really need to life their game!!!
@_date: 2014-12-09 04:58:08
I pretty much agree with though. The Trezor is so expensive for what it is. Part of what makes Bitcoin great is that you can do it with pen and paper if you wanted to. If the answer to security is a $100~ device then too bad for the developing world where "insignificant amounts of money" could represent their life savings :( 
@_date: 2014-12-09 05:11:51
Can't wait for us to have proper decentralized exchanges too. I'm part of  and stories like this just re-enforce the importance of getting away from centralized models ASAP.

Hi - what Operating System are you on? If you have time to drop past our IRC Channel  on Freenode then we can do our best to guide you through the process :)
We are having a Bitsquare WAN Party (group testing session) on Saturday @ 5PM (GMT+1) if you want to join. Developers will be there to answer questions and you will also get a chance to experience trading with the other people who turn up for the party:

Let me ask someone more familiar with Windows than I am to take a look at this thread for you. Given different time zones it might take a little while for you to hear from them.
Looking at it though (and I'm not a Windows user) I think the path might need to be in quotes, something like:


For your router you would fill in one row as:


























Sorry I can't be more help! Will email this thread and hopefully you'll hear more on this soon :)

Java has come a long way since the early days. Give it a go sometime and see what you think :)

Does this video help?
@_date: 2014-12-20 05:05:22
"The only methods that arent reversible are cash deposit and cash-in-mail."
The methods available vary from country to country, as does the ease of reversal. For example, some European and African countries have very robust mobile payment methods which cannot be charged back. Or trading Bitcoins for altcoins would also remove this risk. High risk methods where chargebacks are easy will not be supported, such as PayPal. 
Part of the Bitsquare system is that a hash of each persons bank details is stored. This is designed so that if a person were to act dishonestly they could be banned based on the hash of their bank details. Yes, if they were to create multiple bank accounts they could perpetuate the fraud, but while creating 2 or 3 bank accounts might be possible it is hard to imagine someone making thousands of bank accounts. The greater risk is likely to be from people stealing the bank details of members of the public and turning their funds into bitcoins via Bitsquare. 
These are all risks that Bitsquare is working to mitigate. Wish us luck! If you have good ideas for how to mitigate them further please let us know :)
@_date: 2014-12-20 04:55:00
If only that was the only bug :-P
@_date: 2014-12-20 09:35:13
I would like to see this implemented with some kind of alert/indication to the user of what is about to take place. It's not really good enough just to let random sites take our money with a 402 request when our plugin is installed. Waaaaay too much room for fraud. Even just an alert that said something like, "You will be billed X BTC in 15 seconds" and then it counts down to 0, the charge is taken and the content displayed...
I wouldn't object to a domain by domain setting though where people could allow a single domain to charge them though. Or maybe you could pre-authorize an amount per domain? I would be quite happy to pre-authorize 0.01 BTC to a domain and get an alert/pay-wall when my limit is reached. 
Have you given much thought to the blockchain spam this would generate if a single person were to go through a website and browse 30~50 articles, with each generating a micro payment?
@_date: 2014-12-12 18:34:37
has already answered this pretty well, but there is also a lot of benefit for those involved in being able to trade national currency with bitcoins without relying on a centralized exchange. That's what I'm most excited about!

Discussing the concept broadly we have this video here too:
But we don't yet have a video going deep into the mechanisms behind each part of the transaction. It is on our todo list, but not recorded just yet.

Full disclosure: I'm on the Bitsquare team.
@_date: 2015-01-18 05:10:13
I'm more concerned it could be something setup by law enforcement than something setup to scam people of their bitcoins like Mt.Gox turned out to be. 
I'm involved in several Bitcoin startups and people from the ShapeShift team have contacted each of them separately asking to integrate their services into the payment methods.  It would just be *such* an easy honey pot for LE to setup to significantly de-anonomize transactions in and out of various crypto currencies. 
@_date: 2015-01-18 16:05:14
Have you seen Bitsquare, the decentralized bitcoin exchange?

Thankyou! 
@_date: 2015-01-17 19:18:20
THIS! These sort of things go viral on Facebook all the time. The laptop that got stolen with an unsubmitted Phd, or photos of a loved one who has since died... Put the emphasis on something with sentimental value, offer a generous reward and start putting posters up in your neighbourhood!

The world wide web wasn't great this soon after it launched either. Give it time buddy :) keep complaining and let's hope competent people are able to enter the space and find a good way to solve these problems!
@_date: 2015-01-13 06:25:03
It's probably more correct to say you implemented an API than you implemented "Bitcoins". Many of these points would change if you used a separate API, like Blockchain.info, or ran your own copy of bitcoind. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 17:55:59
I don't know how many hosting providers would allow bitcoind to run on shared hosting. Hopefully zero. The idea of a bitcoind wallet.dat on a shared hosting account scares me!!!
@_date: 2015-01-18 15:37:36
This is great! Could you share how hard you found it to implement into your invoicing process? Are you using a unique deposit address for every invoice? And do you leave it to the client to work out the exchange rate for themselves...?
@_date: 2015-01-26 04:52:41
Thanks for the extra info! Is the ruling, assuming there is one, going to be made public?
@_date: 2015-01-05 10:39:25
The sooner we have decentralised exchanges, the better!

@_date: 2015-01-18 13:23:41
Really...? 
@_date: 2015-01-26 02:11:22
The speed is limited by the Bitcoin network (time taken for confirms to be received so like 10~30min) and the speed of the national currency transfer method chosen. So in some cases when trading with someone with a near instant payment method (I.E. Same bank to same bank) the trade might be complete within an hour. But if sending international bank wires it might take as long as 5~ business days for the national currency to be received. 
It depends mostly on the payment mechanism for the national currency.
@_date: 2015-01-26 03:10:18
It's standard practice to generate a unique deposit address per payment. This means that over or under payment by an incoming transaction is possible to reconcile as each deposit address is unique to a single invoice. Alternatively, it would be okay to create a unique deposit address per customer and then you could apply incoming funds as a payment towards their account, depending on how you set up the backend. 
I've seen systems that rely on a single bitcoin wallet for all incoming payments and they differentiate by giving customers a unique deposit amount. If the customer gets the deposit amount even slightly wrong though it becomes very difficult to work out who the payment came from on a high traffic website.
None of these problems seem like a big deal with a web shop doing 3~ sales a day. But they all become deal breakers pretty fast when your transaction volume rises. Hence my questions about how it will scale.
@_date: 2015-01-26 04:03:38
I appreciate it creates unique addresses each time and they're created within the same wallet. But my knowledge/experience with bitcoinj (and confirmed by the documentation) is that it can't scale large due to the way the transactions are stored by bitcoinj :-(
@_date: 2014-12-16 14:04:09
Please fix bitcoind for us!
@_date: 2015-01-05 10:56:20
If it's properly decentralised there would be no one bank account for the exchange. It would be direct into the bank account of someone who is selling Bitcoins to you :-)
@_date: 2015-01-26 02:24:29
I think baron requires a full bitcoind node. Bitcoind requires 30GB+ as it is a full node but Bitcoinj doesn't hold the full blockchain so it has a much smaller footprint. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 01:59:15
Have you given thought to how this will scale? My understanding of bitcoinj is that it is okay for monitoring a few wallets but once you have hundreds or thousands of wallets it becomes so slow that it is unusable. Do you plan to have a unique wallet for every invoice or set it up some other way?
@_date: 2015-01-26 04:16:15
I wish they could provide more details about how this works. I hope the answer doesn't end up being that they push the GST liability onto their customers. If there were an easy way around the GST then why haven't the other Australian exchanges found it? :-(
@_date: 2015-01-17 18:55:37
Governments are so trustworthy... Of course they can be trusted with back doors to our encryption. Their security clearances haven't ever been given to people who do the wrong thing before, right? /s
How can this possibly end well?!?
@_date: 2015-01-18 16:49:53
Thanks for the explanation! Have $0.10 on me :)
@_date: 2015-01-18 15:33:28
It's similar in Australia. That damn $5/month payment for a bank account :-( But saving $270/year is not such a huge incentive at the end of the day for most people when the learning curve is so steep :(
@_date: 2015-01-18 11:52:38
Pretty sure when you screw the scale on the y-axis that much you can show anything :-P 
@_date: 2015-01-13 15:33:01
Speaking as someone who has worked extensively with bitcoind directly, and from time-to-time with the blockchain.info API, many of these issues would be resolved. Let me reply to them one by one:


bitcoind can be put into testnet mode with a small tweak to one config file. Simply run bitcoind with the -testnet flag to use the testnet (or put testnet=1 in the bitcoin.conf file). 


This can be handled by monitoring when transactions are received and reach the required number of confirmations. If the amount is lower/higher than expected then action can be taken (i.e. request further payment if they underpaid or ask for an address to send a refund to if they over payed). It is trivial to ask customers for an address you can use to refund their bitcoins to in the event of a refund or their order not being processed. 


This is entirely dependent on Coinbase and the amount of currency risk the merchant is willing to accept. 


This can be handled with terms and conditions specific to payments via Bitcoin. The merchant can be explicit about whether their refund will be the BTC equivalent or the national currency equivalent. This is a typical challenge when dealing with currency, just like if you buy a product in British Pounds using a USD Credit Card - your refund will be in GBP and might equal more or less USD when it hits your credit card statement.


It's easy to generate a unique Bitcoin deposit address per invoice (or customer). There is almost no cost to generating a bitcoin deposit address (growth in wallet.dat file size I guess?). 


That's correct - you must wait for the Bitcoin network to become aware of the transaction. You can put logic into your web interface though to wait until the payment hits the Bitcoin network if you like though and have it automatically advance when payment is detected.


If your system requests a refund bitcoin address at time of checkout their overpayment can be automatically refunded. See my answer to point  above :)


It's possible to integrate Bitcoin payment buttons into the UI without confusing people. It's like when PayPal first became available and people weren't familiar with it yet... they just ignored the PayPal option and followed the Visa/Mastercard/Amex option. As more people became aware of PayPal then more people paid through that option. The same is likely to be true for Bitcoin.


Most affiliate marketing systems that integrate with a shopping cart can also be integrated with a script that automatically checks for received payments. This is possible to solve by putting the code execution into the Bitcoin payment checking script rather than into the client's browser window.


This can be resolved with my answer to point  :)
@_date: 2015-01-16 12:54:49
Thanks for giving me such a good laugh! 
@_date: 2015-01-19 13:46:45
If you did crowd funding to cover your costs for making this then I would contribute! 
@_date: 2015-01-17 19:01:20
It is true if your clients are domestic. That equation changes though if you're clients are offshore. Bank details are an expensive way to receive funds when the money crosses an imaginary line for some reason.
@_date: 2015-01-18 12:00:15
Or you're unable to easily get banking/credit card facilities... Or you're collecting micro-payments from people in disparate countries... Or a bunch of other use cases :-P
@_date: 2015-01-13 15:36:26
You handle it by requesting a refund address from the customer at the time of their order. If it's happening on a very regular basis then you can setup a system to check for over-payments and refund them to the appropriate refund address when they're detected.
@_date: 2015-01-14 06:23:35
That's all part of a technology maturing... look at what you can do with tools when it comes to integrating with PayPal in 2015.... then think about what you could do to integrate PayPal in 2002... 
Bitcoin has come so far since it first launched. It's exciting that there are still challenges as they represent big opportunities to those who can solve them well :)
@_date: 2015-01-17 19:03:10
Check out Armory. It is a great application and can be used fully offline for most functions :-)

Brilliant! Please let us know if "Joe" replies! :-D
@_date: 2015-01-26 15:05:22
Take a look at the Blockchain.info API. I believe it will do what you're looking for with unique addresses and the final destination for the funds doesn't need to be a blockchain.info wallet either :)
@_date: 2015-01-18 17:35:45
I think the German Government has classed Bitcoin as money. Localbitcoins wasn't fulfilling the local requirements for what they were doing with "money".

Just the headline we want :
"Bitcoin Powers Child Slavery in 2015"
@_date: 2015-01-13 17:36:50
I couldn't agree more.
There are things I hate about bitcoind though. Primarily the hard drive space it consumes. It's such a huge requirement for a startup website.
@_date: 2015-01-26 02:00:17
It sounds like the way around them is not to integrate with fiat currency.
@_date: 2015-01-18 08:06:00
That guy has too much time on his hands :-P
@_date: 2015-01-18 07:42:53
Correct. There's talk of people using them to mix coins though. For example, Bitcoin to Dogecoin and back to Bitcoin and now there is no blockchain link back to the original Bitcoins... Though if the transactions were watched with data from within Shapeshift then that benefit disappears. It would be trivial for someone with the Shapeshift data to link back to the original Bitcoins, potentially purchased from an exchange that holds your identity documents...
@_date: 2015-01-18 03:48:35
There are a lot of people in the world who work for dollars an hour. Their invoice might be $50 or $150~ for a project. Bank fees suck for payments that small. But yes, the bank fees are no issue once your payment gets to a certain size. 
@_date: 2014-12-20 05:11:23
The greatest challenge between where we are now and this becoming a reality is a rock solid way to do the KYC and AML checks for bitcoin deposits/withdrawals. 
Where it is especially difficult is proving the source of funds from an AML perspective. When sites like Pokerstars receive money from a bank account there is so much they can assume on the KYC/AML side. 
If anyone has good ideas on how these challenges could be solved then please let me know!
@_date: 2015-01-17 18:59:36
Because subcontractors aren't always in the same country and international wire transfers often attract nasty fees ;)
@_date: 2015-01-16 09:16:26
It will be very interesting to see where this goes. I think companies like PayPal think they will gain a lot if Bitcoin is seen as a financial instrument. A bit like what seems to be happening with Localbitcoins in Germany :-(
@_date: 2015-01-26 05:13:16
Just been doing some reading. If it is a private ruling then it is specific only to the person/entity that applied for the tax ruling. So I guess their competitors will either need to apply for their own private ruling or continue with their method of charging GST in the meantime. But you're right. From what I've read it sounds like if Coin Loft has misinterpreted the ruling and the GST becomes payable than it is their problem, not the customers.
@_date: 2015-01-05 12:22:56
AML Compliance becomes important at higher volumes. Individuals trading with individuals aren't subjected to the same rules/scrutiny as exchanges dealing with millions of transactions a year.
@_date: 2015-01-18 04:06:39
Does anyone know much about the team behind Shapeshift? It has been so well promoted that it makes me wonder where they're getting their funding from... The conspiracy theoriest in me wonders if it is someone with something to gain from being able to link transactions from people trying to mix their coins by switching from one coin to another... Am I the only one worried about this?
@_date: 2015-01-26 02:52:44
To quote from the Bitcoinj documentation:
"The Wallet code doesn’t scale, at all. All transactions that were ever relevant to the wallet are loaded into memory, all the time, and re-written every time the wallet is saved. This results in a simple on-disk format accessible to many kinds of apps, but has poor performance for heavy users. In time we’ll probably switch to a log structured wallet file format to solve this."
I've not heard whether they have switched to the log structured wallet file format yet or not.
@_date: 2015-02-07 10:08:15
It means that a single centralized service, blockchain.info and the associated blockchain.info website/wallet/mobile app/etc, will be unavailable. You can still make transactions and view the blockchain with other services while blockchain.info is offline.
