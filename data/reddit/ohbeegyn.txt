Every jump like we saw earlier today will be met by intense selling pressure. That’s what being in a downward channel does.

This reminds me of when I first started investing.

This is not how you dollar cost average. You do not dollar cost average a falling knife. You dollar cost average through scheduled purchases over a long period of time with the underlying idea that you cannot time the market.

SMA100 at 10.6k. Not surprising to see a bounce off 10000. 
SMA200 at $7k. Would not be surprised to see it hit that soon.

As I said yesterday...
“If you clear $15.7k, I'd look at $16.4k for the next resistance level. It's still in the midst of retracing the ATH to Friday's low move. Don't be fooled here.“
Failed at first attempt. I would not buy here until you clear that.

There is nothing positive about the technicals right now. Stop buying in the middle of a massive correction, thinking you’re buying a minor dip.

Nobody should be buying and holding something this volatile unless you are prepared to literally lose your entire investment. You guys missed a clear as day head and shoulders pattern that ended when ~$15.7k broke to the downside. Your next intact support level after $13.1k isn't until $9k.
The complaints about manipulation are unbelievable. You're playing in an unregulated market. Don't risk money here that you cannot risk losing.

Yes to both questions. I would caution people though that whenever you realize gains, be prepared to pay taxes on them, e.g. don’t assume you’re going to subsequently have realized capital losses to offset your gains as you did in this example.

Playing with house money isn't a term that investors use. It's a term that gamblers use. You think anybody still holding AAPL from the late 90s makes statements like this? Of course not.
Be smart. Don't be greedy. Take profits every now and then. Nobody ever went broke that way.

My recommendation is to stop trying to catch falling knives. Wait until a lower low in comparison to Friday’s bottom is established before taking a chance. You’re not there yet.
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:27:17
Maybe. You’re not out of your downward channel yet, so you should be preparing for more down not hoping for a new ATH.
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:47:02
After this week'd low, your next real support level is $9k. Be prepared to ask yourself what you'd do if it hit that. Below $9k you're looking at $5.6k, and probably a test of the SMA200, which I think is a little under $5k. 
This is what happens when you parabolically go up. Good luck.
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:41:25
Just take it level by level. 
SMA50 held on the first test this morning. Next support level would be $10.8k. After that, you’re looking at ~$9k, which is near where the SMA100 is. 
Have a game plan going forward. Don’t be emotional. If you owned at $19k, you had an opportunity to sell when it sliced through the SMA10, or SMA20, or when it was rejected at its first test of the SMA10.

Just saw the market cap of bitcoin is still $64 billion. For reference, the market cap of Target is $35 billion. The market cap of Tesla is $56 billion. Bitcoin has a ways to fall still.

It’s not about the money. It’s not about the money.
Yet the most popular threads at any given point, and the top 11 threads of all time in this subreddit focus on the price of Bitcoin. 
Group think is dangerous, and I’m sure it’s wiped some of you out. Even if this is irrational movement, the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent. That is the number one rule of investing.

Did you mean bear flag? Even then, what time period are you looking at? Flags need poles followed by consolidation.
