You think I should buy now. Or wait for it go down more?
@_date: 2019-11-24 22:35:14
Good point
@_date: 2019-11-24 20:56:53
Will there be ever be an exit point or more of a period when it stabilizes in the near future, If so the question becomes at what point will it stabilize. It’s strange because like a company’s stock or a country’s currency, bitcoin can’t go out of business or can’t default.

1.5-2 years?? What about with the 2020 halvening
@_date: 2019-11-24 21:23:32
With so many people in the world? Will it ever reach that point. There’s always probably going to be someone or some number of people willing to accept it right

Coinbase good app to buy then send btc

In these uncertain times buying slowly is the best tactic you could do. You don’t want to miss out on these prices if we never see under 4K again, but you don’t want to be penniless in the case that it drops further down. Im going to start buying when we see close to $3,000 again

i use Gemini to purchase usually because of low fees, but Coinbase Pro has little to no fees when purchasing.
And for cashing out, I would try and ATM, or just use coinbase.

Give it a few more weeks and see where price is. Your safest bet is to start buying weekly, you will average out pretty good by the time the bear market is done. Not financial advice*
@_date: 2018-11-26 02:50:05
Last year around September time. I remember prices being so volatile that I thought i could make so much money by trading it. Simple lesson here- HODL. Don’t try to trade unless you’re a professional

You will pushed out when price drops sub $2k. Bye bye! 
@_date: 2019-01-12 13:00:07
That's the price based on the average amount it was exchanged for in the most recent transcations. 
This theory, is not 100% accurate but it offers a different perspective as it computes the value based on the number of transactions happening as well as supply metrics.
@_date: 2018-11-26 17:35:13
In my opinion this bear market will continue for a couple more months, mid 2019 we could start seeing recovery 
@_date: 2018-11-26 21:43:07
Long enough to buy at $3k. ����

Easy to set up coinbase pro, definitely go that route. And a bitcoin ATM. Try to find one in your area and check it out
@_date: 2018-11-24 18:40:58
I agree. The wallet address is way too complicated for mass adoption, too many people think its too confusing. We need a way to make it easy for people to buy and sell goods with crypto
@_date: 2018-11-30 16:48:24
Thats what i like to hear!

The price will drop so much your mental barrier will be non existent. It will make you not want to even invest.

Much more % drop to go. Hold on! The higher the price/surge, the greater the correction

Ur gonna be pretty bummed when we drop -3K. You couldve bought 100 if you waited a couple more weeks

[Coinbase Effect is in full reverse compared to the past.](
When Coinbase first added BTC it jumped from $10 to $1000 within a year. Ether went from $12 to $400. The Coinbase Effect is dead we might see the market bleed more based on what happend with the last few coins.
Now everything is bleeding.

Well if you have zero confidence in this month, don’t take this as financial advice but SELL. Sell and buy when no one is buying, which will most likely be around 2K. If you don’t want to sell it all and play it safe, sell at least half so if we drop lower than you bought you could at least have the power to buy more and not be mad at yourself.

at 4 cents per Kilowatt, which is cheap electricity, the break-even price is around $2,000. It is very hard to get prices for electricity under 3 cents, so if we go under $2K expect a complete decrease in the difficulty to mine due to a massive flood of miners being unprofitable and shutting down.
@_date: 2018-12-06 22:58:04

Also I am very curious about next recession as well, either crypto will rise above or its just going to follow the downtrend of the whole world. I predict next economic down turn to happen within next 2 years, i predict bitcoin will reach all time high before start of recession and during its correction recession will begin.
