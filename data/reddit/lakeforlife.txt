Nothing's making me. Just my personal decision.  Waiting to see how things shake out. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 15:52:40
I think OP is looking for an actual rebuttal to the issue addressed in the post. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 05:09:31
Don't forget, we also have a satellite now.

^this guy gets it^
@_date: 2017-08-03 14:42:41
Yeah I suppose that makes sense. For some reason I had the notion that the BCH was inside of my Bitcoin.  Kinda silly now that I think about it lol. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:52:47
Yes, that is one of the things it is used for. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:21:45

@_date: 2017-08-18 23:14:30
Nope, not at all. I believe in the free market making the correct choice given adequate time to do so, which is why I hodl both coins. I was just pointing out that the way you were guiding the dialogue made it seem like you had an agenda to push. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:10:33
Nope. There was only one Internet. Just like there's only one Bitcoin.

Isn't it rule 34? Or am I missing something?

No real substance here. The whole article is just a rant about how "All this Bitcoin Stuff is Fake".

It's almost as if everyone who owns BTC is selling their BCH whilst certain invested players are buying to prop up the price. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 18:53:59
Heh, great news. I've been meaning to have my face removed...
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:18:41
Those are infrastructure examples, things that made the Internet better, not alternatives or competing technologies.  Those things to the Internet are as Segwit is to Bitcoin.

They would have to simultaneously EMP the entire world to destroy the ledger. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:28:21
I acknowledge that, which is why I hedge, but Bitcoin has my heart.  I first started buying for philosophical reasons and I still believe in those reasons. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 14:51:46
I mean, there's been at least a dozen posts about it the last few days.

@_date: 2017-08-23 01:59:15
Lol not yet. But I did encourage all of my employees to get into Bitcoin last January. Only one of them actually did and needless to say he does not regret it : )
@_date: 2017-08-30 01:53:07
Yep, it's not a good look. We don't need to behave the same way in retribution. 
BCH had a rough day today, and I was really disappointed by some of the trolly "kick 'em when they're down" posts over there which I can only assume came from some of the users in this community. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 13:07:58
Lol, you're delusional. The post you're referencing was an honest question, and if it was any kind of FUD, it was against the other coin.
As far as this post, I really can't imagine what agenda it is you suppose I'm pushing. Are you accusing me of being paid by the "decency lobby"?
I can skim your history, too, btw. What I see is a one week old account used exclusively for trolling. If you need to be uncool to people and make accusations at least be a man and stand behind them with your main account. Don't be a coward.

@_date: 2017-08-17 00:17:48
What the hell is your problem?  Read your OP, read your above rant and ask yourself how anyone could make sense of whatever it is you're trying to get across. Smh...
@_date: 2017-08-06 01:48:47
Kind of a dick move. I actually saw that post and had it pegged BS by the title alone. Yeah, they're dumb for believing you but it's easy to trick desperate people. 
A lot of people lost a lot of money, mostly because they were mislead. Not really cool to kick them when they're down.

It doesn't expressly say so in the white papers, but it's what many of us infer from them.  Calling it mischievous is fair, but human progress is rarely achieved without some sort of mischief. 
Anytime an entrenched system is threatened by a mischievous (new) idea, it will use its power and influence to suppress the new construct, especially if the new system is better and has the likely hood of disrupting the current one.

I've been hounding the online booking service I use for my business to start supporting Bitcoin payments. They said they would let me know if/when they decided to introduce a Bitcoin client but I get the feeling they were just humoring me. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 19:47:32
NSFW maybe?
@_date: 2017-08-19 00:03:02


This, by the way, is what's known as a "straw man argument".  
@_date: 2017-08-03 14:24:57
To clarify: Can I still get my BCH from my pre-fork BTC if I add post-fork BTC to the same wallet?

Heh, we live in a very dualistic paradigm. Happens with everything, especially on Reddit.

Lol I just read through the rest of the thread. Looks like I wasn't the only one who got that impression.

Why is "redditor for one day" posting this two week old article while the price is nose diving?
@_date: 2017-09-03 15:51:17
The point is you can buy fewer and fewer amounts of goods and services with your currency as time goes on. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 04:25:09
You realize you didn't even argue your own point, right?  
All you did was condescendingly guess at the underlying psychology of a random internet person and then gave us the definition of currency. In no way did you present evidence that "money" is not created and inflated through the fractional reserve banking system. 
THAT "money" is not created through labor, but through what is basically a "futures" wager on the prospects of the individual's ability to repay the debt.  
Please check out the infographic left by this other kind redditor if you are interested about learning more.  It's worth the wait.  
@_date: 2017-09-15 02:12:07
I agree with OP. In fact, the reason I originally became interested in Bitcoin is that I truly detest the fact that a large portion of my tax money goes towards inflicting violence on other human beings. I want nothing to do with that.

Taking control of currency with a transparent, immutable ledger would be a huge step towards impeding state violence. Of course there will still be taxes, but organizations like certain intelligence outfits will have a much harder time funding their black projects with drug money.

@_date: 2017-07-12 18:14:32
Thanks for posting this. 
He's right that this "psychological hang-up" is a huge issue to overcome, in fact, it would seem that the propaganda, public relations, and the like of our current paradigm are aimed to undermine and discourage any of these ideas.

It will keep happening until we reach mainstream adoption and the moon. 
Price volatility can be very lucrative. When an entity can confidently effect the swings of the market... Well, that's easy money.

It's a shame that alt coins ever existed. I think you're right but I hope these pretenders haven't tarnished BTC's image too badly.

While I can relate to that sentiment, we won't be going to the moon without the goodwill of a large portion of the world population. 
Enemies of Bitcoin will be attacking it's image, in fact, one could argue that they already are. Like it or not, PR is and will continue to be important for BTC's future success.
