It's not crippled. It's just an exchange. When the dust settles The Exchange that suits the people will come out on top. Right now everybody is transitioning to different exchanges at the moment.

I know everybody worships Bitcoin because it's the original but that doesn't mean that newer coins with better technology have not come out, on top of that anybody who's new to the crypto game realize Bitcoin is probably the slowest profit margin of all the

You have no idea what you're talking about. Maybe you should try sucking your mom's clit.

Cool, stick it up your ass.

How about we just use bitstamp, Gemini, or a host of other exchanges that have been found more reputable. It's nobody's job to get coin vases shit in order, that's their job not ours. When they see 90% of their customer base leave that's when they might get their shit together.
 
 Calling and crying is what victims and cry babies do. I don't know why these posts get up voted
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:50:24
It's hard to feel sorry for dumb people. Who tries to move a hundred k at this time?
@_date: 2018-01-20 21:44:00
Bitstamp has a garbage interface.
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:50:00
Who in their right mind would try to move a hundred K during such a volatile time in the market especially when the biggest exchange is volatile?
 
 I laugh at these stories all day. Let me guess you kept all of your money on coinbase and in tried to move it out in one transaction? LMFAO

This is the kind of nonsensical bullshit I'm talking about. Just because Bitcoin has good technology doesn't mean people should invest everything they have into it.

Since 2014 the value of Bitcoin has gone up TEN TIMES it's original value.
As the dollar fades (As peter schiff predicted) - and the news, media, governments and administration continue to ignore and manipulate currency to keep the rich in the top 1% - Bitcoin has no other alternative but to rise. 
It is imperative. 
For the sake of human survival and evolution, there is no avoiding it.
Just like, how a brand new cell phone with camera, blue tooth, wi-fi, internet, and 3g capabilities used to cost $400-1,000 in 2012..
... You can essentially get a phone like that now for FREE by filling out a few forms and stating your income. There is a reason why 50% of millentials still live with their parents ages 18-30.
The US dollar is not holding up.
It will fail.
Bitcoin has already gone up 10 x's it's original value.
Any cent you make, put it in bitcoin.
