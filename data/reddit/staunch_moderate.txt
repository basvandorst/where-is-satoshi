As someone else said, he was making the same statements that the common person unfamiliar with the technology would make. That’s the shit my parents/grandparents say because they actually are ignorant to the whole thing. I don’t think he was trying to undermine crypto, i think he was setting the stage for a good explanation of what’s happening.

Just double checking, but if my BTC was on coinbase at the time i just don’t get that, right? I was so new to the whole thing that i didn’t realize just how easy it was to move and left it all there :’(

I’m still here, and still confused!

The enemies were always those in power. Don’t let them fool you.

Please tell us more.

If everything I’ve invested into crypto became worthless tomorrow it would have been worth the ride knowing some real good came from it all. Maybe one day we’ll all be able to give back to something we care about. Thanks dude.

Got a new iPhone. Haven’t used authenticator in a while so i forgot about it when switching to the new one. Did i lose access to any accounts that require it?

That doesn’t seem too bad. Might take a little time but that’s much better than not having access to it at all

Could someone give an easy explanation of how to move funds? Bitfinex uses the term API key but coinbase uses Bitcoin Address. Are these the same thing? I’m so paranoid I’m going to send all my money to the wrong address and fuck myself.

Buying citizenship for St Kitts is minimum $250k though, so not really reasonable for most of us... yet.

Shut up and take my money. 
Seriously though, i guess in my head the property had to be purchased in full so $400k seemed absurd. But I am in my mid 20’s and haven’t bought anything more than a cheap car so you put it all in perspective for me. How difficult was that whole process?

It's still another obstacle in making people feel comfortable in Bitcoin
