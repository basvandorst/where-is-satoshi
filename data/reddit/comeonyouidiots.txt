But regulated by majority is a total fallacy in bitcoin. If it wasn't, the Mt Gox situation would have never happened. It seems possible but nobody is doing it and until then I'm scared shitless to use digital currency. Shouldn't we know exactly where and when the mt Gox money went? Isn't that the sales pitch the advocates are giving? Well I don't see people getting their money back unlike paper currency which, although inflationary, is insured.

Since we're talking about capitalism...how much Is the prize? :)
I'm a libertarian however I feel that this issue is really a matter of gun rights. And as for abroad, where we don't have jurisdiction without a national military having a base, the countries might not allow us to carry weapons to protect ourselves. A major, major purpose of the military is in securing trade routes so that the world can trade without any hiccups. If all countries allowed guns I'd say we wouldn't need this, however let's say you have an American company working in the middle east harvesting oil or some other dangerous area with a valuable commodity. If those corporations could arm themselves I'd think the free markets would sort everything out. However, since many countries make self protection difficult (especially on a large scale that a commodity company would need) we need the military to provide the defense of these trade routes and such. We have basically bullied or negotiated a way to have major military installments near every world trade route because countries don't allow corporations to protect themselves and they either trust or allow our military to do it. The problem with eliminating the military is an economic one and when global trade freezes because neither a military or a private entity is their to provide protection when a mass robbery or something like that happens, shit is going to hit the fan. The world can't afford to have hostage negotiations on trade routes! If every country would allow gun ownership then I think we would hardly need a military, but they don't and we need to do business with the world and as it stands, that requires our military to secure trade routes. That's how I see it.

I'm more skeptical of bitcoin than almost anyone here. But saying it isn't producing anything is wrong. It's just like paypal in a sense, it's a service (intended to be) and provide value for the flexibility, privacy,  security it offers.  I don't see the benefits but I know what the market thinks of it.

Good for you for cashing out and not getting suckered in. Obviously you leave some in but at least get back what you originally invested. Congrats on a well placed bet.
@_date: 2014-02-04 21:05:26
Well that's a hell of an investment seeing as you're up a few hundred thousand dollars. You sir, have some balls. Have you at least sold off some and took profits to insure against a loss?
@_date: 2014-02-15 06:34:13
Using futures, sure. But the forex markets suck for any retail trader.

I misspoke and meant US dollars. But still, that risk is far less than a bitcoin shop defaulting because they have no protection whatsoever.
@_date: 2014-03-05 23:36:31
And right now, that's a huge pain in the ass compared to credit card fees for 99% of transactions.

I think even less than 1 BTC is plenty for just testing the waters. Glad to hear you made a fortune and are spending it (what sounds like) responsibly. Hats off to you.

Does anyone have a clue how they are going to divvy up the "shares"? Karma, length of use...?
@_date: 2014-03-06 02:25:41
Exactly my point. The community regulation is failing because until they find the coins, IF they find them, investors are left with nothing. I'd call that a failure.
@_date: 2014-02-04 06:48:04
I'm not at all saying you're wrong but do you have the balls to put your money where your mouth is? I've been thinking about picking up some doge coin and I'm just curious.
@_date: 2014-03-07 07:28:24
Fear of the dollar would irrationally lead you to hold bitcoin as if it were safer. Hypocritical much?

Honestly I have no clue how Reddit has such a relatively low valuation. I think most tech valuations are a bit insane but based on the number of loyal users and branding opportunities this site has, you with think it would be much higher than, say, snapchat... Then again the bankers probably took one look at the owners "no endorsement, no app, no ads" agenda and said these fuckers are nuts, they have a gold mine on their hand and they're sitting out front eating cheetos instead of digging. I'm very surprised no one has come along to buy Reddit at that price and turn it into a cash cow. The owners probably wouldn't sell it, anyways. 
Don't give me your deep analytical valuations or insight about snapchat, I've heard it all. But Reddit could be making so much more money than it is, that it's not even funny.

You do realize that bitcoins are being used as an investment tool much more than currency, right? People are holding on instead of using them, look at the trading volume decline over the last year. Youre one of the tiny minority that are using them as intended, as currency.
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:17:56
I think you may be biased, but everyone is in some areas. Theyre doing the 12 days of bitcoin on Bloomberg tv right now. Trust me that it is dominated by investors at the moment. Thats why it got so high, so fast. Its usefulness didnt explode, its profitability did.

Inflation kills this idea. Sorry to burst your bubble. His fortune, left in cash in a brain wallet wouldnt be worth anywhere near what it is now in 50 years or more.
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:22:20
I disagree with that monetary analysis, but Im not gonna argue about something thatll never happen. His money is all going to charity already.
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:39:23
Better than a cash "brain wallet", on the upside

Well, the numbers are growing because there's been a huge price move. You get a lot of people wanting to sell out of fear, and a lot wanting to buy on what they think is cheap. Relatively none of the activity spike has been currency related. There's a few places that are starting to accept it, but probably more that are blocking it (foreign countries) and even the ones taking it haven't seen much business, they're just kind of setting up in case spending in BTC ramps up so they don't miss out. 
Source: None. But every time the stock market makes a big move the trading volumes shoots up like crazy, and bitcoin is behaving in an exactly identical way. I trade stocks/options and the resemblance to BTC is painfully obvious to me. It behaves like an asset, not a currency. Which makes me think it is an asset. Look at all the comments, they're all investors! Oh I hope BTC goes higher or ouch that last dip hurt! None of this thread is about people actually using the currency.

Adding to that, this is what you get when a bunch of clueless people start investing in the hottest new thing. It takes a completely emotional stance and reasoning gets thrown to the curb. Im not saying bitcoin is useless but it has some absolutely huge obstacles to overcome and avoid. This is all just a gamble. Nobody can predict the future of something so complex.
