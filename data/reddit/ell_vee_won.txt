Sushi coma
@_date: 2014-12-05 04:09:40
Aaaanndd I'm gone.
@_date: 2014-12-04 06:15:38
Wait an hour -__- lol. It locks up when we try to spam bad links while searching for the correct digit. 
@_date: 2014-12-04 07:06:50
Not me! You snuck it in there on me
@_date: 2014-12-03 23:57:20
Fun stuff!
@_date: 2014-12-04 06:22:19
It certainly does! I'm only trying a couple letters every couple minutes to try and avoid being blocked again (would be the third time today haha)
@_date: 2014-12-04 06:40:09
Ah! Gotcha. I was getting there eventually! Just didn't wanna get blocked out.
@_date: 2014-12-04 23:08:20
I'm still in the game! Care sharing what letters you tried? I've tried a bunch but still going
@_date: 2014-12-04 00:04:55
Hmmm, well poo.
@_date: 2014-12-04 22:44:22
My plan to start at the last first always backfires... it was the first... sigh
@_date: 2014-12-05 03:51:28
No thieving my internet monies! :-)
@_date: 2014-12-05 04:13:04
Nicely done! Even if I dislike you a teensy "bit" for snagging that before me :-)
@_date: 2014-12-03 20:00:34
Thank you so much! I actually plan on doing just that. Perhaps some udon, too. I can't resist those noodles
@_date: 2014-12-04 07:24:48
Evil, evil person! :-)
@_date: 2014-12-03 19:06:57
I missed the first two by mere seconds! The third will be mine!
Edit: Sigh. Maybe the fourth. 
@_date: 2014-12-04 00:10:02
Yea, I already served my hour of punishment. It ended right in time for all this fun that started back up
@_date: 2014-12-04 06:12:31
Ahhh! Should've noticed only 7 digits following the dash. Now to try and figure it out without locking myself out of changetip again..
@_date: 2014-12-04 23:17:33
Well if you want to try, we already have a large number ruled out. Someone tried A-U, I added in 0-9, so your chances would be fairly decent before getting blocked..
Edit: nevermind, looks like got it
@_date: 2014-12-05 03:42:45
Exactly what I was thinking
@_date: 2014-12-06 07:28:37
Have you gone to the changetip site and gotten yourself all linked and everything?
@_date: 2014-12-04 07:42:45
Got it! I think.. Will update with amount if I was successful
@_date: 2014-12-04 00:23:31
Reminds me of [this.](
@_date: 2014-12-04 07:11:10
Sneaky :-) Mobile makes it easy to see the link when you go to reply to the comment tho.
@_date: 2014-12-03 22:02:14
I'm still here! Had to wait out my changetip time limit. Still trying to be first on one of these tips
@_date: 2014-12-04 07:05:36
Got it! I'll start waiting a couple minutes to let others play. I don't wanna be a bit hog.
@_date: 2014-12-03 19:13:15
Every time I stop to comment you post a new one lol
@_date: 2014-12-04 21:13:16
Ready to go!
@_date: 2014-12-04 07:00:43
Let the fun begin! (continue?)
@_date: 2014-12-04 07:48:56
Missing H=, or H stays the same?
@_date: 2014-12-03 22:55:53
Glad everything turned out alright in the end, other than losing 25 minutes of your day. 
@_date: 2014-12-04 04:56:38
That's it! This thread is never getting closed out. I will continue to monitor for the chance of more digital deliciousness
@_date: 2014-12-04 07:38:26
The tension is killing me!
@_date: 2014-12-03 23:50:05
I'm good at these scavenging ones, on the other hand! Two is enough, though. I'll leave any others for fellow scavengers
@_date: 2014-12-03 19:57:49
On the plus side, the number of people watching has skyrocketed from 8 to 14! 
Edit: Make that 19! We're making waves here, people. :-)
@_date: 2014-12-04 06:25:48
For anyone else, I've already tried aAdDbBfFxXvVzZnNmMsSeE
@_date: 2014-12-03 19:08:55
No :-( not giving up tho! 
@_date: 2014-12-04 07:32:13
@_date: 2014-12-04 06:07:07
@_date: 2014-12-05 04:19:15
Thanks! You didn't have to do that!
@_date: 2014-12-04 22:52:35
Ahh gotcha. Well glad someone got it because I would've just stopped when I saw it had been collected!
@_date: 2014-12-05 04:08:24
Too much pressure!! I've probably got 5ish fails left. I wish I'd have known not to try 0-9 at the same time as @_date: 2014-12-05 05:49:43
Ahh gotcha. I missed that when I was scanning the results from each. 
@_date: 2014-12-05 03:47:34
Dis? Remember I'm new to bitcoin, so don't make fun if this isn't it haha
@_date: 2014-12-03 19:16:35
4 seconds after the post and it's already gone. This is now personal. Down goes the mobile and out comes the laptop. 
@_date: 2014-12-06 07:28:01
Sigh. Work got in the way of my bit hunting fun tonight :-/ I'll keep an eye out for more though!
@_date: 2014-12-05 04:11:34
No, thank you! This was a ton of fun and everyone involved was great! Especially the awesome donors. :-)
@_date: 2014-12-03 19:52:32
Sushi sounds great! Now if only there was a way for someone to send me "one sushi" haha :-) 
@_date: 2014-12-04 07:23:49
Keep them coming!
@_date: 2014-12-03 23:40:52
Haha I've been here since link  and have yet to succeed on one of his, but alas, I shall not be deterred!
@_date: 2014-12-04 06:36:47
What was the letter?
@_date: 2014-12-04 00:17:34
Nicely done.
@_date: 2014-12-05 04:10:24
Guess all three of us are now waiting on that 1 hour countdown to race each other yet again haha
@_date: 2014-12-04 07:09:13
That would actually be pretty cool. I'm gonna try to resist unless it's a particularly tricky and fun looking puzzle, then I might not be able to resist
@_date: 2014-12-04 07:58:18
Not sure if I did, though. Hasn't shown up yet
@_date: 2014-12-03 20:11:48
29.5 bits. A little something to help you get started :-)
@_date: 2014-12-03 23:36:59
For what it's worth, I'm still here trying to be the first on one of your giveaways simply for the excitement of being the first to the link!
@_date: 2014-12-04 07:28:10
Yay! It was E. 
@_date: 2014-12-05 03:24:09
Nicely done! These fast ones are not my poor laptop's strength. I'll stick to the thinkers
@_date: 2014-12-03 22:31:41
Yay! Got it, thanks!
@_date: 2014-12-04 00:35:21
This is only my second day on the whole bitcoin scene, and I have to say that this is one of the most friendly, awesome communities that I've come across. Glad I stumbled upon it!
@_date: 2014-12-04 06:41:36
Welcome back!
@_date: 2014-12-05 03:18:06
:-) Thank you! I enjoy these scavenger hunts the most out of all of the puzzles
@_date: 2014-12-04 23:09:01
And the second I say that, I'm blocked....
@_date: 2014-12-04 00:06:13
Is the Earth round?
@_date: 2014-12-04 00:19:12
I'm with I just can't stop trying to win
@_date: 2014-12-04 07:55:30
You were missing the H = C, unless we were to infer that from h = c
@_date: 2014-12-04 22:45:41
Don't worry, we're here for you.
@_date: 2014-12-04 22:40:51
I knew I should've kept an eye on this thread! I had a feeling you wouldn't be able to hold out till 7, OP, but I decided to wait patiently and check back then haha. Good thing I came back :-)
@_date: 2014-12-06 17:44:37
Then here ya go! 50 bits @_date: 2014-12-06 07:21:12
Haha definitely went the longest! Very sneaky to just hide it in there with very little warning :-) 
@_date: 2014-12-06 07:15:38
Hey!! I resemble that remark!
@_date: 2014-12-06 07:33:58
Hopefully you start late enough for me to play! I'll be working till about 10pm Eastern, but I'll try to get home as quickly as possible to be able to participate
@_date: 2014-12-04 08:01:57
Thank you so much! Between you and you guys definitely gave us a lot of fun and made my day! I'll poke back in around 7 tomorrow if you'll be back! 
@_date: 2014-12-04 07:29:29
These people are fast! Sheesh lol
@_date: 2014-12-04 00:58:42
Argh! My plan was to start from the end of the alphabet and work backwards in hopes that those of you who started at the beginning would take longer to reach the letter (which I hoped would fall in the second half of the alphabet)
@_date: 2014-12-03 19:55:18
This is true. More exposure for can never be a bad thing!
@_date: 2014-12-04 06:47:50
Haha thats rough! I'm probably close from guessing all those other letters
@_date: 2014-12-04 06:10:30
I'm here! Just have been focused trying to crack this cipher over on for some fun and bits. It's frustrating
@_date: 2014-12-05 03:26:26
Holy crap, I got a quickdraw
@_date: 2014-12-04 23:39:21
So using this method, is there no way to tell if you hit the correct letter while moving through the letter progression? Or is that small save line the confirmation?
@_date: 2014-12-05 03:22:20
Hope everything gets better! You've given a bunch of people a very good time!
@_date: 2014-12-03 19:41:09
What this has succeeded in doing is convincing me that I actually do need a new laptop :-) I shall not give up hope, tho! 
@_date: 2014-12-04 00:04:20
Good luck on your hunt, as well!
@_date: 2014-12-04 23:15:58
It must be 20, because that's right around where I got blocked. I was varying the timing tho, anywhere from right away to 20ish seconds. It would seem timing doesn't impact as much as number of failed attempts does. 
@_date: 2014-12-05 03:27:57
Mac here too! No F5, but definitely lots of Command+R haha
@_date: 2014-12-03 20:06:29
One less F5er now. Changetip says I've failed too many times and need to come back in an hour haha. Still was a lot of fun! OP rocks!
@_date: 2014-12-04 01:00:14
Also, Arrow is about to come on!
@_date: 2014-12-03 19:49:55
is a great sub, the only problem is that it is a much smaller community. I don't think it would have the number of users participating to do such a rapid giveaway. 
@_date: 2014-12-05 03:07:05
Cake :-)
Also, thank you!
@_date: 2014-12-03 22:04:42
That's very kind of you! Thanks! :-)
@_date: 2014-12-05 03:32:28
Does holding the iPad in one hand with my laptop ready to click make me a cheater? 
Anyway, next few are not mine. Need some others to win and get excited about the hunt for internet monies!
@_date: 2014-12-05 04:06:31
Not 0-9 either. 
@_date: 2014-12-04 02:36:42
May your bitcoin fountain never dry up!
@_date: 2014-12-05 18:52:00
Sweet! Thank you, as well! 
@_date: 2014-12-03 23:59:50
*F5ing intensifies*
@_date: 2014-12-04 22:49:16
hmmm very interesting, the first URL also points to a tip that says it was collected
@_date: 2014-12-04 07:57:26
Ah, fair enough. Some of the ones in the old thread that the other random puzzle people were posting only had the letters swapping one way. I should've still tried it this way since it's logically correct
@_date: 2014-12-05 05:47:24
Yes indeed :-) Thank you. 
@_date: 2014-12-04 06:23:31
What kind of limits are they placing on your tipping?
@_date: 2014-12-04 00:55:47
I tried :-( unfortunately it ran me over my changetip limit so now won't ever know what letter it was! 
@_date: 2014-12-04 06:46:09
Got it! Thank you!
@_date: 2014-12-04 00:02:39
Woo! I think I finally got one of yours! Waiting on it to show up :-)
@_date: 2014-12-06 07:23:49
Well if it helps you sleep, it's all yours! :-) 500 bits @_date: 2014-12-05 03:43:41
lol "just you two" I'm feeling the love!
@_date: 2015-02-08 07:24:31
Love finding these threads! You are so generous!
