I think the problem is in order to "convert" you have to send your BTC to someone which incurs the fee you're trying to avoid.

Pro tip: Just ignore the ideological fringe ignoramuses. It's a lot less stressful to stay out of the mud they live in. The far right in the US literally has been arguing that not everyone needs health insurance, some would rather just not have it and not pay for it. I asked a few on Twitter what should happen if a middle class person without health insurance gets cancer—should the tay payer save her or should she die?—and not a single one responded to me. That's how thoughtful their arguments are.

That's cute. A quick trip to the ER would be north of $1k if you're uninsured.

I meant "so smart" with respect to his comment that he was beating the market easily but fund managers were too dumb to invest like he does. He's like a guy saying he's so smart at black jack he knows the cards before they're dealt. If someone says that, and it's not from their $100M yacht, I think it's safe to say they're an idiot.

Right. One of those libertarian laissez faire positions that sounds good in theory but is a mess in practice.
Anybody that wants should be allowed to start a private equity company, go to the financially illiterate members of society, and sell them a bunch of garbage for profit. You know, get rich quick investment schemes. We don't need any laws against that. Everyone should just be a savvy investor. How novel! 
The accredited investor laws are pretty stupid because people should be able to take some accredited investor certification process and waive them. But they are what they are and they're slowly moving them to be better. And just don't be a pussy and be able to afford it, I'm an accredited investor. Why isn't someone as smart as you one?
But I'm glad you're "smarter" than fund managers. Maybe you should become one? Outperform the market? Become a billionaire? Or just keep lobbing half baked ideas out on the internet and then go stroke your ego. Either plan sounds good.

I'm not some deluded cheerleader about cryptocurrency, I think it's highly speculative, I only hold 1% of my portfolio in it, but Jesus Christ that article is stupid. Why would you write about something you don't understand at all? I should write a Forbes article on what it's like being a 3 year old girl growing up in Afghanistan.
If he even understand the basic concepts, like what a blockchain is (duh!), he'd understand how stupid, "someone could hack the &lt;linked list of hash pointers&gt;", is. And then he cites hacked exchanges as proof! Lol. But then states after being hacked they can pass off their forged coins. THAT'S NOT WHAT HACKING AN EXCHANGE MEANS. 
This is modern day journalism. Write some link baity article about shit you don't understand at all, rinse, and repeat.

All evidence to the contrary.
Saying you're smarter than all fund managers but not smart enough to have any money is pretty pathetic. 
Me? Middle class family, shared a bedroom with 2 siblings growing up, public schools, athletic and engineering scholarship to a top university, climbed up tech industry, make $320k/yr, spend $60k/yr, have $1.6M in the bank, in my early 30s. 
But please educate me more on how smart you are and how nobody will hand you any money. The system is holding you down! In America. In 2017. How pathetic.

I literally have multiple friends who are ibankers and 400% over 8 years in private capital is literally so wrong it hurts me. They regularly lose huge sums of money on private equity moves, they tire up investor money sometimes for 3+ years in illiquid form, and will even *demand* investors give them more money, lots more money, to finish a deal. And their returns are not 400% over 8 years. That's ridiculous. They outperform public markets by a few percent typically. Please introduce me to whoever you know that has a private equity firm that crushes 400% over 8 years. I have money for them. Ever Bernie Madoff didn't touch those numbers and he was running a fucking racket.


I see, you're just a 22 year old who knows more than those stupid fund managers. I have 10 years on you, am an accredited investor, but don't participate in the big boy private equity games. I stick to publicly traded assets. I hope you get there quickly and see what it's really like. You're going to be disappointed. Hopefully we all make a gagillion dollar with cryptocurrency and I hope you don't lose it all chasing 400% returns.

it takes 5 days to verify the funds. But once you've funded you can trade between crypto and USD instantly as much as you want.
I bet you can use a credit card to instantly fund your cash account but I bet there are some steep fees.

from what I've seen on twitter institutional investors, eg: hedge funds, are throwing money at it right now.

this is one of those oversimplified libertarian views. There are predators who will prey on the financially ignorant before and without these laws. They're always a bit clumsy and seem like bullshit but saying everyone is an adult and need to protect themselves is pretty stupid. A libertarian once argued we don't need police, people can hire their own security. You're saying we don't need an SEC, let people sell whatever shit products they want.
I get that it's clumsy to tell some 30 year old he can't invest $100 into some high risk investment. But they're already working on updating those laws, and you can get into high risk investments by joining a managed fund where a professional makes that decision for now. There are reasons to have laws against letting some poor family throw their life savings into a venture capital investment. It's better for society to have police and SEC and other groups protect the weak. 


It's really not.

I agree that the current qualifications to be an accredited investor are bad. I said above people should be able to take a financial test or course to waive the restrictions. 
But you weren't replying to that. You were calling me a trust fund douchebag because I think the parent commentor who said fund managers are too stupid to beat the market like him is a deluded moron—I said if he can really beat the market he should become a fund manager and then a billionaire. 
I stand by my comments. He's deluded. And if he really was so smart he could beat the market he *could* become a billionaire. It wouldn't even be hard with a 20 year timeline.
And I don't have a trust fund. Whether I'm a dbag is a matter of opinion.

anybody that takes a risky position in a bull market outperforms "the market". And you'll one day find out that taking a risky position in a bear market underperforms the market. Crazy, huh? 
I don't understand your point though. The laws allowed you to amass great wealth. But you're not wealthy enough to be an accredited investor? And the laws are holding you down? The same laws that let you invest in crypto. Hmmmm.
I love the crypto folks who think 400% returns over 8 years is bad. WTF are you talking about? You think you're entitled to an awful lot. Lol. I worked for 4 years at Starbucks! Where's my god damn yacht?!
