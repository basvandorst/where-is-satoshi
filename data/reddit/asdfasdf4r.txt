Vertcoin started fair because much more people are mining it right from the start. There is not a single address holding 10.000 or more coins afaik.
@_date: 2014-01-09 22:23:54
Once payout from PoW blocks stops, Peercoin is left with 1% inflationary rate which many think is a healthy rate. I am quite sure Peercoin is already producing less new coins a day then Bitcoin or Litecoin, but don't quote me on that. Better to check for yourself.

I am thinking about exchanging a major part of my BTC holding to PPC because of this issue... But I'm struggling to make that decision.

I think this is the problem right here with PoS implementation into Bitcoin.
Also, it is not about making all Cryptos the same. The differences between coins is what makes it interesting imho.
@_date: 2014-01-30 12:43:23
Thats awesome! Congrats Bitcoin, thanks reddit.

@_date: 2014-01-09 19:30:52


Ripple and NXT suck because they are *instamined*, all the currency is available at the beginning and then **the core developers/people sell their coins**.
Peercoin on the other hand generated coins in a PoW and PoS hybrid approach, so at first PoW mining was the way to go. This solved the problem of NXT and Ripple, as the coins where not generated at the same time by few people.

I think it would be pretty obvious that you are just guessing if you're throwing around various names, places and pet names.

Better store them in an offline wallet.
Look up *MultiBit*       
It's an easy and more secure way of storing your Bitcoins.

I just checked the graph now and wanted to ask if this is another DDoS attack? 
I'm fairly new to this and want to understand the market better.
Regarding the article; Are the attackers still earning money from this? Considering that the bitcoins they use for the microtransactions are already their own, the only costs they have would be the renting of a botnet. Or do I miss something here?

But with the current price increase, people also tend to hold onto their coins a lot more.
What most of us don't see though is that we can pay with Bitcoin and just rebuy those spent Bitcoin. This way it is like using fiat but we also support Bitcoin. :)

You are right! The problem is this is not good for Bitcoins security.
@_date: 2013-12-05 08:35:41
I always wonder if one could modify cgminer to only submit shares below the current network difficulty, but keep a found block for yourself to cash in the whole block.
Anybody thought about this security issue?

Okay, I think I misunderstood something. I thought that p2pool is a simple mining pool without accounts which can be utilized with cgminer.
I assume this is partly wrong?

I really have no idea. But in my perception 1000 is OK and 10000 is to high for now.
Your opinion can of course vary from mine. Bitcoin is still very young and everyone has another opinion on it.

Symmetrically encryptions don't use public / private keypairs.
They use the same password for decryption and encryption.
@_date: 2013-12-12 15:12:57
I understand what you mean and agree with you fully.
My opinion on this issue is that most powerful entities (i.e. banks) are to arrogant to realize or acknowledge that crypto currencies are a mayor thread to their business model. Maybe once they attempt a direct attack, it'll already be to late.
@_date: 2013-11-06 16:16:33
Hm their loss. I also try to tell close friends or family members to just put 50$ into bitcoin and hold for 5 years, but most of them aren't paying attention. Oh well.

One Bitcoin is $1000 now. So in reverse $1 is 0.001 BTC.
We have to come up with a new annotation as numbers that small are annoying to work with.
Nobody lost $999, BTC was on a steady increase over the last months.

But why *buy* most of the coins for millions of dollars, when you render your bought coins useless? You can only lose a lot of money this way.
