Exactly this, it makes sense

Well this isn't bankruptcy yet, Bitfinex seems to feel it won't be needed. I hope they make it work. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 01:27:34
BTC was all that was stolen. In regards to fairness it would be unfair to the people who currently aren't victims. Why should Bitfinex create mores victims than the hacker already created?

I had a dream my brother punched me in the dick. So I punched him back in his dick. And then the T800 good Terminator from T2 came and broke up the fight. It was highly stressful.

Core devs are just a dozen talented devs... in a world of 7+ billion people. The other teams aren't monkeys. All ideas should have been openly discussed and allowed to live or die by their own merits. Not this highly damaged crushing/demonizing of all opinions moderators don't agree with. It has fractured Bitcoins community.
The Core devs, the 'monkeys' would all be part of multiple DECENTRALIZED teams. They heart of Bitcoin is supposed to be decentralized. Right now it is extremely centralized.

Exactly, it is shameful what has happened. All ideas should have been open for full discussion on all forums. Let the ideas own strengths determine whether they live or die... not censorship of half the opinions.

Core and Blockstream are funded by the establishment. AXA, biggest banks in the world. The community was disrupted when this forum and bitcointalk were suddenly turned into closed discussion worshipers one kind of thinking, one team, one option. Roger has reacted to that. He started nothing.

Satoshi's idea was a shitty idea. Bitcoin was also shit until the current devs congregated around it. Bitcoin only works and is awesome because of the current Core team. No team on the planet of 7+ billion people will ever do better. If they die Bitcoin will die.

But you did imply that I or other people wanted a compromised, incorrect Bitcoin. When I say we need compromise, I mean the opposite of partisan extremism that has come from all sides but you twisted that into 'compromised bitcoin' Telling...

I really wish everyone would just meet in the middle. Core devs are brilliant people and I love their innovative ideas. But also really like Satoshi's p2p cash original vision that the Classic people tout as their main motivation. I want sidechains, segwit,  I also want gradual blocksize increases. Woe is me.

It is worth noting it appears she was/is in a relationship... or at least was dating Johnny Dilley of Blockstream at some point. Look at her Vine he's all over it, and a bit in her Instagram too. Not exactly unbiased if they are together...
Whether you agree with 2mb or not... Gavin has been very important contributing to Bitcoin. Dismissing him with this vitriol just because of an engineering disagreement isn't cool.

What corporations are pushing Classic? Is this opposite world? Blockstream is the only obvious corporation involved between the Classic and Core camps. There are outside corporations that have shown support for both though. Also... Core's primary goal is to use Bitcoin as a settlement layer. They have expressly stated this which is cool since I'd rather them doing it than R3 and Etherium. I just lean towards 'why not both?' 
@_date: 2016-02-10 13:50:38
I'm looking for reasonable compromise, which really thus far only one side has budged and shifted at all. 
@_date: 2016-02-10 16:09:21
The hash shall decide. The glorious hash. I just want the fighting over. Both teams have brilliant people that can work together. We just need compromise and balance which has been sorely lacking!

Yes, redesigning Bitcoin since the moment they came along. Satoshi planned big blocks, this is undeniable. If you feel he was wrong, that is one thing, but to say people who want decentralized devs to keep following the original and proven path are destroying and redesigning is another. Devs like B.U. aren't trying to turn Bitcoin into a settlement layer like Core has currently been doing. That is a redesign. 
@_date: 2016-10-17 15:51:32
Consensus is only agreeing with Core! Only ever! Other people who don't agree aren't part of consensus!

From someone in BTC since May 2011... I don't really disagree with much of the sentiment. The blind absolute faith on this sub is astonishing. The complacency is quite something. The complete rejection of all critique, self analysis/criticism only leads to bad places. I don't own any altcoins but Ethereum's rise has been quite something and it isn't based on nothing like all the others, it is out innovating bitcoin. And the slowness of Bitcoin development is ruining its first mover advantage. Sucks...
@_date: 2016-10-12 12:13:27
Oh, yes, this is exactly how it should work! Our centralized Core gods tried to push a change and those decentralized infidels are challenging it! I agree, as does anyone that understand Bitcoin that Bitcoin is about centralization!

Bitcoin has been functioning as it always has since 2009. It managed to get so many people on board in its original state that its price climbed all the way to $1200 plus... that IS the proven path. It has now hit the 1mb limit Satoshi planned to increase. So lets do that. It is ridiculous engineering to completely rip something to shreds after so much success and turn it into something else. Bitcoin should be Bitcoin... not Core's settlement layer. Try again.

Another old timer, it feels like a completely different community now. Saw huge gains since then... but after MtGox all this crap came... didn't expect it. I'd also be happy if ETH died and BTC exploded upwards as the dream always was.  I never had doubts until the last year or so. Satoshi's was a big blocker, that WAS the original vision, but no one seems to care anymore, since Core says it is better to complete redesign the whole thing... Thus the genius that created all this would be completely SHIT on by a community that is too comfy with what they are used to. Upgrades planned by Satoshi Nakamoto are considered now rebellious treason.  Incredible.

No one has been paid anything yet. Only claims have been accepted or rejected.

Ah yes, I was just letting you know no one else has received any funds yet. It seems you figured out what was up after the weird email. =)
