NOTE: If your goal with tor is to browse anonymously (or even pseudo anonymously) complex browsers like firefox can be dangerous because there behavior is fairly unpredictable and they lend a lot of trust and control to the remote end. It's fine for evading some filter like this but if you thought you might be actively attacked or investigated you should be using the absolute simplest user agent possible that accomplishes your goals.

Ok I went and read the documentation. Not only does it usually end up on their servers, but an alternate implementation (used on an app by app basis) has the app author include their public key to encrypt the users credit card information which is then decrypted on the author's servers.  
So it's actually much worse then I was saying.

This seems to be part of an unfortunate culture on the modern internet (I think (although I might remember incorrectly )ironically pushed by the mayor of new york back in 2006 over child pornography)  
The idea that you can't just build information munching tools, the idea that you must police your users... it flies directly in the face of the philosophy of many small sharp tools that do exactly what you tell them.  
If New York were not such a massive hub, I'd vote to blacklist them over stupidity like this.

Where I live the absolute best internet you can get costs $70 a month and gets you a 20GB allowance (though it doesn't count between 12:00 and 5:00 so you can schedule cron jobs around then for free). It also has an average ~800ms rtt. This is what happens when municipalities start subsidizing carriers.

Yeah, that was more for anyone else coming along and reading this. The whole bundling of firefox with tor irks me a LOT because of this.

Of all the people, github can hand you a line to copy/paste to your crontab for this. We already have tools for automatically repeating things, it's not something bitcoin really needs, or something most users want.

@_date: 2014-09-09 14:00:01
Sure, but bitcoin is a /lot/ harder to steal since  
1 the secret number used to spend them is chosen randomly  
2 you don't give the secret number to anyone, ever  
With credit cards  
1 the secret numbers are generated in series  
2 you give the secret number to anyone you want to send money to, in some cases you even give it over the phone (or fax) completely unencrypted.  
So in general you keep it from happening in the first place.  
Also, since you can't have a negative bitcoin balance (unlike credit cards which are always zero or negitive) you can put your bitcoins in multiple wallets and limit the damage caused by one being compromised just like credit cards.

Bitcoin isn't inherently secure. It's as secure as the user makes and gives you the freedom to just rig things or to do crazy stuff to make it insanely hard to steel. It's not about being secure it's about the freedom to choose.

Or to have the phone read the one dimensional bar code (it would have to use a unique inventory number though, not just a upc) on the product, have the user pay through apple, then have apple's servers communicate with the in store system so it won't throw the alarm when you leave carrying the product and it's rfid tag. I believe apple did this (or something similar) for a while in their own stores. Why have a POS at all? this way you have fewer people to employ and more floor space for merchandise and less bottle necking.

"bits" is a very bad unit IMO:   
Firstly there is already a "bit" unit defined by Claude Shannon when he invented information theory and is used as a fundamental unit for measuring information. Here you not only have a name collision, but a name collision with something already used to measure properties of bitcoin.   
Secondly we already have si prefixes, those have completely obvious meaning and bits don't. I've been asked to pay "so many bits" before and it's very confusing and, in the end you have to go and hunt down the correct definition for the unit.   
Thirdly: what are you going to do when the price changes to some other number? bits was defined for the price in late 2013, it's currently much more convenient to use mBTC (2 to 1 for USD) and it's probably going to change again. This is what si prefixes are there for, stop fucking around with the vocabulary and just use the standards.  
I think the unit "bits" should be treated as a form of slang because it's ambiguous, and seldom used outside of the group of people subscribed to this subreddit.  
If it's really a serious problem use either scientific notation (completely unambiguous and gets rid of all the zeros) or satoshis (which gets rid of fractions) or some combination of the two (satoshis with scientific notation sounds rather nice actually.)

This is probably a little OT but I'd like to remind everyone that most of us are far more likely to lose our wallets by over securing them then by being attacked (except with deterministically generated wallets based on short pass phrases).  
I've lost my PGP keys because of this before and almost lost half my bitcoins.  I would highly recommend making a completely unencrypted backup on something offline and keeping that somewhere you trust (probably near where you sleep).

Mail and news are from bell-labs/ATT (perhaps you could make arguments about FCC ties there...), the web is from CERN (Brittan). The NIST built the main backbone but that's very old now and not that big a deal any more. DARPA's original network used 5bit address and only allowed 32 Hosts to be connected at any given time, the modern internet standards come from the IETF and have for a very long time. The IETF is completely independent from any national government and is just a group of volunteer engineers discussing the standards on open mailing lists and occasionally meeting in person.  
The only things the USG has control over are ICANN and the FCC. The FCC (mostly due to social inertia, in the US no one on the federal level is supposed to be able to do this) can regulate what American services can/can't transmit/receive. ICANN controls (surprise) America's names (.com .net .us .gov etc) and numbers (IP subnets assigned to the US). So in theory non American citizens can use non American services on the internet without worrying about American regulation.  In practice most service are American anyway...

I meant compared to credit cards and other payment methods currently bitcoin requires at least 10-20 minutes in order to prevent double spend attacks. I've been told there are theoretical ways around that, but no one has implemented them (to my knowledge)

I'm under the impression that 0.0.0.0/8 is used to refer to hosts on the local network (typically during initialization). Some OSes may actually try to route that which may open you to various kinds of attacks.

No, they use part15 (ISM) frequencies, which where actually designed for things like microwave ovens and so the FCC expects a bunch of noise on the channels and doesn't care what you put on them if you're actually broadcasting.  
These are probably using MURS or FRS instead. It would be nice if the FCC allocated a general purpose, citizen usable, long range vhf store and forward band for things like this though...  
EDIT: If you need something like this /right now/ a cheep android and cheap vhf ham radio transceiver (ala baofang or so) and a ham license will let you transmit to APRS which is somewhat mesh like (it has store and forward anyway)
