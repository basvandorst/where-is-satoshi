The R3CEV downvoting bots are at full steam lately. The clueless moronic newbies who want "MUH BIGGER BLOCK" also help.
@_date: 2016-01-18 18:50:35
There's no debate about Segwit being a better idea than hard forking to gain 1MB of block size, we are dealing with 2+2=4 type of shit here.
@_date: 2016-01-18 19:11:30
There's just no point in defending a hard fork to get 1 extra MB when we have SegWit.
Yes it's more complex, but it's way less risky. And SegWit has been tested enough now for it to be the objectively superior option.
Risking a HF for this = as dumb as it gets.
@_date: 2016-01-17 22:55:06
Yeah, it's like "Let's pretend a business can be sustainable forever while delivering free meals without no tradeoffs!"
This is exactly how your average bigblockstard looks like.

"Oh it's just impossible that something that clearly goes against the banks and governments interests is being attacked".
Fucking normalfags.

You are implying that I post in Reddit in the first place, and that I don't want to use my "real nickname", you conspiracy theorist! Assume good faith.

If I was a Core dev, I would also quit, I would keep developing Core but I would NOT release anything, guaranteeing that the Classic leeches don't keep copy-pasting all my work with the excuse of "muh open source". Once the talentless Classic dev team ruin it, the Core devs would come to fix the mess, regaining consensus, and demonstrating who deserves to run Bitcoin.
Of course, im assuming that there would be something left to fix after the Classic idiots ruin it.
@_date: 2016-01-18 01:26:18
You still don't get it. We need "THE CORE" of Bitcoin to remain as node-decentralized-friendly as possible, therefore, there's no fucking argument that can be pro-hardfork to raise the blocksize in a post-SegWit environment. Had Peter Wiulle never had the moment of inspiration to come up with SegWit? Then a HF increase to 2MB would be reasonable, but have we SegWit now. PW literally saved our ass, so we don't need to HF, but you still want to HF. WHY.
There's just no argument if your top priority is decentralized nodes which anyone that wants Bitcoin to remain censorship-resistant should have as 
@_date: 2016-01-18 19:07:26
I agree, we must stick to core, and we must stick to 1MB. If we didn't had SegWit, I would be pro-2MB, but we have SegWit, so risking a hard fork to get 1 extra MB on the block size is legit DUMB and it undermines all the hard work of Peter Wiulle which it's what could save us from an unnecessary hard fork before we deploy the Lightning Network.
@_date: 2016-01-18 19:03:55
Why would they help leeches that copy-paste your shit then change a single valuable that goes against Bitcoin's best interests? (decentralization of nodes).
Classic is already dead as soon as the talent on Core dev says "enough". Then, you'll have your 2MB, your low price BTC as Core devs resign, and your insecure BTC as nodes keep decreasing.

Big blockers can't even read in context. Just leave, it's over for you here.

"Assume good faith."
Are you guys fucking kidding me?
Again: &gt;We are going towards a cashless society, do you think governments, banks, and "TPTB" would like that an alternative economy outside of their control exists?
They know this, and they don't like this. You are delusional if you don't think Bitcoin isn't going to be under constant attack, and this is exactly how an attack looks like. Get some perspective.
This is a WAR. Get real.
@_date: 2016-01-18 02:04:20
Scalable means that Bitcoin can grow while 1 average person can run 1 node.
1 person = 1 node or death, that's that.
You can start scaling it up without having this into consideration, but guess what, that's fucking Paypal 2.0. 
@_date: 2016-01-18 18:51:37
There's nothing rational about wanting to hardfork when we have SegWit.
@_date: 2016-01-18 18:52:20
This is exactly how a big blocker that gets hard pressed to still keep defending their stance looks like.
@_date: 2016-01-18 01:56:52
Again, there's no need to hard fork now thanks to SegWit.
And ultimately, Bitcoin will never scale to worldwide levels without LN. All protocols solidify for security's sake. Just like TCP/IP, layers are built on top. You are delusional if you think Bitcoin will survive periodical hard forks in order to increase the block size so you get to pay less fees for your frappuccinos.
You want free shit, security and decentralization all in one, it doesn't roll that way buddy. And the funny thing is, fees are so insanely cheap compared to alternatives that I can't believe we are risking a HF just so save some cents of a dollar. Un-fucking-beliable.

Keywords: decentralisation of main chain access
Why, why, why, do you want "decentralisation of main chain access" (keyword for, please don't make me pay a couple more cents of a dollar for my transaction) as a tradeoff for loss of nodes.
Why not just use Paypal? Again, please THINK.
There's no fucking point in using Bitcoin if nodes aren't decentralized, and decentralized means your average user being able to run a node.

No, you can't have both buddy, you can't cook the cake and eat it.
Running a node is a pain in the ass already for average people, shit takes a lot of ram, shit's slow to download, they are improving it with genius shit like "secp256k1" which will make Core 0.12 boot a ton times faster, they are adding noob-friendly Tor support in the next version too, they are trying to make it easy and privacy friendly in an environment while we ALREADY have a low count for nodes, but you want to doble the blocksize guaranteeing that people running a node now with modest resources get pissed off and say well fuck it, im not running this anymore, and we go from 5000 nodes to less.
Please think if losing a single node is worth it in order to pay a couple less cents of a dollar for dumb shit.
@_date: 2016-01-18 18:54:13
Of course it is, it's ENOUGH to keep dealing with the transaction volume without being exposed to the dumb risk of a hard fork while we deploy actual scalable solutions such as LN.
Pick a better hobby, you are lost here.
