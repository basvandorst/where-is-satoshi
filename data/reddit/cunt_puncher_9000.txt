The guy wants to keep 100% of it in BTC, I'm just trying to get him to pull out enough to start a sensible savings plan.
If it were me, I'd pull out $100,000 and leave $50,000 in BTC but I'm not OP.

Yeah, I feel you.  I sold 10 of my 20 @ ~650.  Not too chuffed that the price went up since then since I've only put in $2000 to start (so I locked in a +200% return and still have 10BTC riding).
Pretty conservative - I could have left it all in, but I'm happy to take a profit and be done with that.  BTC is now 2.5% of my portfolio (was 5%) with the rest being vanguard mutual funds.
Who knows what BTC will do - but I'm happy to still be along for the ride AND to have made a profit.  Going on a vacation this summer with the money I made :)

You're defining 1 BTC as some sort of milestone that you want to fit to.  


I'm not putting 100 anywhere.  It's just SI units.  1 satoshi, 1K satoshi, etc.  You're getting that 100 because you're trying to keep using BTC.
If you remove the desire to think about 1 BTC in terms of Satoshi then there is no problem.  And that's my point entirely.  We're not moving from BTC -&gt; Satoshi so that we can still think in terms of BTC.

A satoshi is a satoshi.  It has value - if you think about it, 1BTC is no less arbitrary, it's just where the decimal point is.
And in terms of learning curve, we're talking about making sure that it's easy for everyone who hasn't yet learned (or has not learned much) about bitcoin.  For them, there is no reason to maintain the historically significant 1BTC = 100000000 satoshi.

You need to diversify, nigga.
Take out $5500 and put it into a Roth IRA (if you don't have that maxxed out already) and keep a 3-6 month rainy day fund easily accessible.  I'd also keep enough cash on hand to fund next year's Roth IRA to the max.
So yeah, I'd take out $20k and keep that as a reserve.  BTC could be worth $0 next week and you'll feel much worse about a 100% loss rather than missing a 30% gain.

By your definition of theft though, any contract I enter in wherein I agree to pay someone for a good or service could be considered theft.
If I agree to pay you $5/hour to build me a road - you're taking my property (the $5 per hour) which belongs to me with the intention of permanently depriving me of it.
You've entered a social contract wherein you've agreed to pay a portion of your earnings for the betterment of society by the funding of schools, libraries, etc.
But come on - how **selfish** is it to not want to pay for things that you use.  You think those roads are free?  And if you're not earning that much, you're not paying that much in tax yet you still get an equal benefit to someone who is paying a lot of tax.  
Fact of the matter is - you've already benefitted enormously from other people paying tax.  You not wanting to pay your fair share is ridiculous.
When you say things like "remote uninhabited island" that says it all right there - you want all the goodies that come with taxes.  You want the roads, you want the infrastructure.  You just don't want to pay for it.

Honest question, if you have more money that you're willing to buy BTC  with, what stopped you from buying BTC with it earlier?
@_date: 2013-11-12 07:05:20
Depends on what you mean by crash, if you mean 30% - yeah that's possible.  TBH I work in tech and it scares me to see the TWTR IPO.  For a company with no profit to be valued that high is scary because it seems to be 2000 all over again.
The thing is though, if Bitcoin went to 0, no one will care.  If the dow went to 0, you'd have a lot bigger problems than not having money.  People would be fighting in the streets and bullets would become a precious commodity.  If the banking system as we knew it failed, it would be absolute chaos.

Can be.  Hydrogen gas can be generated by separating hydrogen from oxygen in water by passing an electric current through the water.  Typically a platinum plate will be used and hydrogen will bubble off of the cathode.
That hydrogen can then be used to create power, either mechanical or electrical.  There are hydrogen fuel cells to power electronics or even hydrogen cars using more traditional engines (IIRC BMW had a Hydrogen powered 7 series).
But it's possible to use electricity to "generate" electricity, although you do lose efficiency at each step.  The trade off is that you can on-board hydrogen much more quickly than charging a traditional battery, so the trade off of energy loss vs time gained is worthwhile.

There are cars that you can lease for $99 a month, heck you can lease a Subaru Impreza for $159 a month.  That's a great car for that price, especially if you're like me and likely to move often.  The harder thing to quantify is that I can either pay $15,000 cash for a car now, or pay $2500 down and $159 a month and invest the rest of the money.  If I earn a modest 5% return on my investment, you'd make --- edit: okay I just ran some actual numbers
[5% intrest rate](
[7% intrest rate](
So these are assuming a 36 month lease with $2500 down on what would be a $15000 car that you could otherwise buy outright with cash.  If you lease you can actually do TWO 6 year leases and have $400 or $1260 left over after the end of the two 3 year lease cycles BUT you have no car.
The alternative is to spend the cash outright and buy the car at $15,000 and have a car at the end of 6 years.  If you want to drive a new car every 3 years, picking a **cheap** lease is not a bad option.  Don't go get a $500 a month lease though.  That's not very wise.
But yeah, assuming that after 6 years your $15,000 car is worth ~$3,000 then you're not out a huge amount of money by leasing.  Depending on what you paid to maintain your aging car that could shift, but I'm assuming you'd also pay more in insurance for the leased vehicle.
So if you'd rather OWN your car, buy it.  If you'd rather get new cars periodically, lease.  Just choose a sensible lease option.

Right, but - let me rephrase.
I'm just as liable to the type of attack you're suggesting (keylogger, etc) with a single wallet.dat file in existance.  My questions is, say that I had a backup of my encrypted wallet.dat file somewhere and a person got hold of it how s --- oooh, so you're saying if they had a copy of the wallet AND THEN They stole my password.
@_date: 2013-12-06 08:46:41
To make you feel better though - if you didn't sell / lose them then, would you sell them now?
I ask because what if the value was 1,000x what it is today in 4 years.
Okay so if you said YES you would sell them now, would you kick yourself in 4 years?  Cause that's basically the same as selling 4 years ago and kicking yourself now.
And if you said NO what would happen if they were worth 0 in 4 years.  Would you kick yourself for not selling now.  Of course.  That's the same as having sold 4 years ago if bitcoin was worth 0 today.
So what I'm saying is - you only really lost what the value was on the day you lost it.  I remember reformatting a hard drive and thinking, shit there are 10 LTC on there that I just lost.  Well they're worth $20 now ( in total, not per coin) and I CAN re-buy those if I want to.  I didn't.  Now they're worth $400ish.
But I'm out $20 in my mind, not $400.  I could have bought $20 of LTC to make that $400 today if I wanted to replace those LTC but I didn't.  And by that same logic any coins lost / stolen / wasted are just the same.  It's the value at the time it was lost.  Because $20 of LTC at the time it was lost was still just $20.  If $20 of LTC was actually WORTH $400 then EVERY $20 bill in my pocket was $400 that I 'wasted' by not buying coins.
So yeah.  You lost some coins, but I think you're seeing it right.  You lost the value on the day that it was lost.  After all, losing 10BTC today would be losing $10k regardless if BTC was $10/BTC tomorrow or $100k/BTC.
@_date: 2013-11-12 17:15:43
I know that it might happen, yes.  But I've taken to a lifestyle which I can afford even if there is a crash*.  I have enough of a 'rainy day fund' to survive even if I were laid off for a few months.  I don't mortgage no a house I can barely afford.  I drive my dependable, yet old WRX which I love, and I don't spend my money on shit I don't need... usually.  I do love motorcycles and travelling :)
Furthermore, I'm continually investing, so any dips and bulges in the market will be dollar cost averaged out.  Trying to *time* the market is a fool's errand.  As I get older and can no longer tolerate such fluctuations, I'll shift my assets increasingly into more stable vehicles such as bonds, and ultimately a portion into cash as I near retirement.
\* by crash I mean like 2000 or 2008 again, not the stock market going to 0.  What I'm saying is that if the stock market went to 0, cash itself would be useless.  Banks would be closed, stores would be closed, etc.  This would *never* be allowed to happen and only crazy doomsday preppers worry about it.

I'm a sensible 20 something who is saving for retirement slowly, but surely.  I have a portfolio of low expense ratio mutual funds and a small, but sensible portion in bitcoin, roughly 5%.
The stock market has been doing very well recently, This year I'm seeing near 20% returns on my mutual funds and 370% on BTC.  I'm happy with what has happened so far and I can afford to lose 5% of my net worth should things collapse entirely for some reason.

@_date: 2013-12-02 04:54:03

I treat bitcoin as any other item in my portfolio.  Right now, I have a mix of mutual funds as well as bitcoin, with about 5% of my portfolio in bitcoin*.  The way I treat any of my investments is to dollar cost average - to just say that I want to allocate X amount of money per unit time to this investment.  So if I want to put in $10000 / year into VTSAX, I'll do it each month at $10k/12 per month.
No reason to treat bitcoin any differently.  It's funny hearing people talk about oh, I don't want to buy X (stock) right now because it's too expensive per share.  What do you mean, expensive per share?  If it moves by 10% it moves by 10%.  The cost per share is MEANINGLESS.  Now, thinking something is *overvalued* is a different story.
Thus is you believe that bitcoin/anything else is going to move up (aka it's not overvalued) then it doesn't matter what the price per share/bitcoin is.  10% is 10%.  But if you feel that in the short term that there may be fluctuations, then you can do what I mentioned in the above - dollar cost averaging.  That way if it goes down slightly, you're going to have an opportunity to buy at that lower price, making your average better.  If it goes up, then you'll have already secured some at the lowest price while you continue to add.
Note that this only really makes sense for people like me who are thinking very long term.  I'm looking to continue to add to my bitcoin in slow increments.  What will the price do in the short term?  I don't know and frankly I don't care.  I just believe that in the long term that it will be a viable currency and a useful investment.
\* I do plan to use my bitcoin to buy things as well, it's just never come up so far.

I'm sure they figured out that if they adopt BTC that they'll get a bunch of free publicity and goodwill.
Plus, their target market probably coincides very nicely with most of BTC using population.
@_date: 2013-11-26 03:23:21
By that logic every dollar you spent on coffee instead of BTC was worth $xxx
@_date: 2013-10-31 04:14:24
Wait, I'm confused.  So I have a wallet.dat file.  But if I lost that but had my public and private keys I could still recover my monies?
@_date: 2013-11-28 08:29:16
Pay back +1% of the BTC withdrawn.  Don't think of it in USD terms.
@_date: 2013-08-28 05:13:46
@_date: 2013-11-07 05:33:05
Yes, but when you think about it that way, every time you decided not to buy $30 of BTC was just as bad as what you did.
It's a currency and it was worth $30 at the time.  No two ways about it really.

Yeah you're using their equipment and electricity.  Putting that kind of load on the servers and generating all that heat is not cool.  Not to mention downloading and running a networked program on company servers.
You really do deserve to be fired for that.

You've basically discovered what "shorting" is when you hear it in investment terms.  If you borrowed bitcoin from your friend and agreed to pay him back in 1 &lt;time_unit&gt; - you're betting that the price for you to buy that &lt;investment&gt; **then** will cost less than it does now, essentially free money for you.
However, when you buy a &lt;investment&gt; you can only lose how much you put in.  Shorting exposes you to theoretically infinite loss so be careful.
@_date: 2013-11-26 03:48:23
Yeah I'd agree with you there.
@_date: 2013-11-12 18:18:59
I guess what my point was is that if the USD / USG were to fail, there are bigger problems than having money.  Also, BTC would be hard to use because I doubt the internet would be working.
If you seriously think that the USD / USG will fail, I'd go buy some guns.
@_date: 2013-11-24 21:13:23
It has everything to do with being theft or not.  By living in the US you are agreeing to give your money in the form of taxes for the betterment of society.
Like I said, if you disagree - no one is forcing you to stay.  You're free to leave the US.
How IS taxation theft?  Because you don't want to pay it?  Then don't live here.
@_date: 2013-11-07 05:38:47
There is always someone buying BTC at the highest it has ever been.  Think about it.
When bitcoin was $1, somoene was a fool to pay the highest price.  Same when it was $2, $4, $8, $16, etc.
It's where you think it might go in the long haul that counts.  After all, people here are bemoaning not buying it at $4, but that was the highest it ever was at that time!  Same as now..
@_date: 2013-10-08 06:53:08
Can I ask why?
I'm assuming that it drives up rental costs even farther than they already are (which is insane) as you're essentially competing with hotel prices?
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:32:58
For motorcycles the same sort of thing can happen.  People use a steering damper - essentially a shock mounted to your steering mechanism - to keep it from wildly oscillating in a positive feedback loop:
I wonder if something similar could be done for the trucks of a longboard?
@_date: 2013-11-07 05:44:18
So then question.  Would you sell it all now?  Seriously, answer that.
Because otherwise you just have unrealized gains.  Paper gains.  And it could all go *poof in disappear if BTC were to collapse.
Or would you hold it and risk the potential of gains vs the potential of decline?
You're saying I wish I was smart enough to buy then, BUT would you have been smart enough to sell now?  Is now the best time?  Will it go up 100x more and you'd be MAD about selling now?
What if you sold it all at $50?
Not only are you asking for hindsight to have BOUGHT it, you're also depending on having the foresight to know when to SELL it.  
@_date: 2013-11-26 03:25:02
I agree with you BUT to play the devil's advocate:
Can't really have your cake and eat it too.
If you want decentralized and no government oversight then that's a risk you take.

At a certain point, it'll be more profitable in terms of hashes/dollar to try to generate the private key for that account.
@_date: 2013-10-25 09:46:07
For reference: 200* 200 = $40,000
@_date: 2013-06-12 06:43:54
Well, it will always be profitable to people with free electricity and cheap hardware.  But the transaction fees collected + the thinning of the herd (miners quitting) will make it profitable for some.
The difficulty will adjust and all will be okay.
@_date: 2013-11-11 20:35:05
Ha, fair enough - sorry for being dense.  Though in my defense, you see the (if I didn't sell my BTC earlier they'd be worth xxx).  For all of those posts, my reply is still valid.

@_date: 2013-11-26 03:05:48
Yeah I know - I think I need to keep $100 in there as the min balance but you need to have SOME liquid funds to pay for things.  Most of my money is in mutual funds (20% return this year, not bad - though I hardly expect next year to go as well).
My credit card bill is about ~$1000 a month so I keep about $1500-2000 easily accessible.  The rest goes to Vanguard.
And, of course, I have some bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-14 03:19:02
Yeah I've made about the same, though from a smaller principle.  I can cash out, but per rule  I didn't invest more than I'm willing to lose so no harm seeing where things go.
@_date: 2013-11-21 06:38:28
Everyone here that is suggesting mBTC or uBTC is missing the point entirely.
We're not (proposing) switching to Satoshi/mBTC/uBTC so that we can continue to think in BTC - we're switching our complete way of quoting and thinking about the currency.  No longer will people talk about how many BTC they have, but rather how many satoshis.  The price will be $___ USD / satoshi and you'll buy goods and services quoted by satoshi.
There is no point to maintain easy conversion to BTC because the *only* people that would want to do that are early adopters who could easily do that anyway.
If everyone quotes things in &lt;some new unit&gt; there is NO NEED to maintain easy convergence to BTC.
People arguing that we should use something smaller than a Satoshi are debating which unit would be best suited, and that's fine.  That debate is welcome.  I'm just saying that if you're arguing for mBTC or uBTC you're only doing that because it's what you're used to, not what's best for moving forward.
@_date: 2013-11-19 06:00:25
Sure, but yeah it sounds like you're looking at it the right way.  You lost $80 of currency.
I mean the follow up question is - IF you had that, would you sell it all now?  Otherwise it isn't $15,000 USD it's just BTC.
If Yes -&gt; would you feel bad about the price being $10,000 / BTC in a year?
If No -&gt; would you feel bad about the price being $10/ BTC in a year?
If Anything in between, both options are applicable.

Just as a counterpoint, I've had no issues with them.  Sorry for the hassle, op.

He had the option to buy those coins on the date that the laptop was thrown out.  As did all of us.  He lost the value of those coins on that date.
To imply that he lost any more than that is to imply that we all lost by not buying coins on that day.  Missed opportunity is a better word, but if you could predict the future there are better returns that could have been had than on BTC alone.
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:37:16
Why not just put in a buy order and go to bed?

I'm using Mt. Gox currently, but I've also used CampBX as well.  
Just buy BTC from wherever and then transfer them to whatever exchange you prefer that allows you to place a limit order (meaning, you set the price to buy|sell at.  A market order is give me whatever the price is now - though, you have to account for volume as well and you may pay a different amount).
I've already made my desired return on BTC so I cashed out via coinbase last week, received the confirmed deposit in my bank account a few days ago.  I left 1 BTC and some cash to play around with, mostly just for fun.  I set up buy orders if the price dips between 300 and 600 in a bell curve and I can just leave that there and forget about it.
I'm not sure if those buy orders will ever get hit, but I wouldn't be surprised if they do.  
@_date: 2013-11-26 02:02:54
Yeah sorry for being so harsh, but it's not a good idea.  
@_date: 2013-10-31 04:24:51
Yep, I put 2k into bitcoin and have ~56k in mutual funds.  Just about what you're saying.  I don't want to lose those BTC, but shit I've seen my mutual funds go down $600 on one day and up $1000 the next.  Losing 2k in bitcoin isn't the end of the world and I plan to hold these basically forever so I'm in it for the long haul.
@_date: 2013-11-05 06:50:08

I say we just embrace the fact that people have no idea what bitcoin is and just call it "credits" in the same way that every futuristic movie uses "credits". 
Just have 1 credit be 1 satoshi or whatever.

Thanks - yeah I saw that CampBX is going to allow personal checks when you fully verify with them (which I assume means sending in my SSN, semen sample, and first born child).
