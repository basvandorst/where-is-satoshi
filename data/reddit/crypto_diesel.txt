Only if it happens now. Very shortly new exchanges will be out that will free altcoins from Bitcoins death grip... Then Bitcoin can crash all on its own, and you'll be able to sink with your glorious Captain Satoshi - just like on the titanic! ������
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:02:48
If this is a true crash - we've still got a loooooooong way to go yet on this bear run! 
@_date: 2018-10-10 11:32:18
I think most here miss the point.... Bitcoin most likely was created by the same families who founded the banking system... How else will they usher us into accepting a cashless society where all money is digital, and thus far more easily controlled by them and the government's they own?!

Wow... a 6 day old reddit account. Good little troll! ��
@_date: 2019-01-03 14:57:57
Fair enough... But none of that really works better than the "stable coins". Satoshi could have simply made the price of bitcoin stable if he wanted it to truly free the unbanked or be used as a true currency. Instead, it looks more like a scam that has benefited the whales and black markets more than anyone else. There is no getting away from that fact. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:27:11
What proof do we even have that any of this is connected to Mt Gx or their lawyer? It's all just FUD... and a great cover story to help push the price down even further. Look out below!!! 
@_date: 2018-02-08 00:15:22
Errrrrr.... are you even watching the charts right now???
@_date: 2019-01-02 21:58:03
So what about holding tether or USDC on an exchange like Binance, would the keys still apply, or is it different for stablecoins?
@_date: 2018-02-08 00:27:55
Did you even read the article? They created yet another token out of thin air. This time claiming it's backed by euros. If they don't have all the dollars they claim to, how have they all of a sudden got 87m euros? 
@_date: 2019-01-03 13:48:47
So Bitcoin was supposed to have been created to help us move away from centralised money supply to a decentralised digital currency. After ten years... Bitcoin still is in no position to be used as a decentralised currency. Seems more like digital gold to me, but that's not what Satoshi intended right? 
@_date: 2018-02-06 18:00:18
Korea most definitely is out the game now. Also, since when have Koreans been known for being rich? The Koreans weren't even buying all that much crypto... It was the rich Chinese using Korean exchanges. That's one big reason why China is so strict on crypto's now, they don't want Chinese money flooding into Korea anymore. The Korean government is totally corrupt. They are allowing the crash to happen, and most likely aiding it... then will buy the real bottom - and hold for 5 years. Then again - there is no reason for Bitcoin to ever go back to its ATH. The tech and the coin is garbage compared to newer crypto's. Rarely in history has the first big mover in a new market gone on to become the market leader inside 10 years. Think MySpace, AOL, Betamax, and so on. Bitcoin has seen its glory days. After this bloodbath people will be very careful about going anywhere near it again in Future. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 15:47:30
Errr.... whilst the price of Bitcoin is STILL going down??? 
@_date: 2018-02-09 10:49:17
You call a few days of slow growth a recovery? I'm not upset by any means, I'm just a 10 year forex trader as well as ftse stock investor. I day trade the volatility on Bitcoin so it matters not to me which way it moves, I just know it will move more than forex. 
From an investor level, i fully appreciate why stock investors won't touch crypto's with a barge pole in regards to their main portfolios. They may well take a gamble with some throw away money, but they sure as heck won't be selling their stock portfolios to move to Bitcoin as a safe haven. You'd have to be totally insane to think that would happen!
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:12:17
Did you buy the other 3 dips as well? The first dip you'd have lost 45%, then if you bought again you'd have lost another 45%... and then 3rd dip you'd have lost 35%. How confident are you that you won't lose another 30-40% on the next dip? You're either very brave, or very stupid! 
@_date: 2018-02-06 09:35:14
Bitcoin was pure speculation. Without a tried and tested lightening network, or much lower fees - it never had any real useage case. It never was and never will be digital gold. RiP Bitcoin! 
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:58:14
Why such a specific number? I'd say the chances of that happening are about the same as Bitcoin hitting $53,294 in the next few days :-)
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:18:27
A video showing slaves on a ship which is destined for destruction - quite a good comparison! And we all know what happened to the Roman empire right? 
It's not brave to HODL, and those who sold since December are the only WINNERS here! HODL'ing is the coward response. It's equal to burying your head in the sand when things start to go bad around you! 
You were brave to buy into an EXTREMELY volatile crypto asset... the BRAVE thing to do right now would be to get out whilst you're still ahead, or cut your losses if you don't want to see your blockfolio stay red for the next 12 months! 
If you are that confident in Bitcoin, and you truly know how to read the markets - then you should see that we're clearly in a crash, and the price is clearly going further south. Better to cash out now and buy back in when the dust settles. That's if Bitcoin still has any reputation left by the end of this crash... I personally see FAR more potential in other altcoins that have FAR superior cryptocoins for use as everyday currencies. 
Best of luck either way... only the brave will survive this crash - you just need to decide if it's braver to cling on to a sinking ship, or to get out whilst you still have a lot of life left in you! 
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:45:31
In that case I'd say it's a lot more concerning that a relatively small amount of coins is able to influence the price so drastically in a short period of time! Proves that larger institutions / mining companies or anyone with a large amount of wealth can manipulate the price of Bitcoin to their liking with ease. 
Perhaps this is just one big cover story to deflect away from wall street manipulating the price for their futures contracts??? Do we genuinely know the wallet connected to mt gox? All seems like a load of hearsay to me
@_date: 2018-02-09 13:01:41
Well, true, it is definitely the most volatile in history. The dotcom scam was close though! 
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:50:00
Depends on how long you carry on holding for... We only have ourselves to blame really if you got in during the last bull cycle. Pure greed has fuelled this crypto bubble. Many of us could have gotten out early with much higher profits if we hadn't been so greedy. I sold for 60% less than i could have gotten just 5 weeks ago - but at least I'm not at a total loss. I've made more than I'd have gotten leaving my money in a bank, and for that I'm very grateful.
The whole speak of "HODL" during what is clearly a crash is the worst advice possible to someone who's risking more than they can afford to lose. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 19:28:20
Cryptocurrencies aren't currently regulated. The media is HEAVILY influenced by whoever will pay them the most money. This is all one big ponzi scheme right now, and most of us realise it. The only winners are those who get in and out at the right times to profit. Everyone else is just hodl'ing on, praying the price will rise up again to the ATH. 
The tech will eventually be put to good (legal) use - and will become widely utilised within finance and industry. I've no doubt about that. Right now though this is just one giant casino - the market manipulators will make sure they bleed this cash cow dry to the bone before they hand it over to the regulators!
@_date: 2018-02-06 09:32:44
Haha. An even simpler rule is never to buy high! You can preach to the dumb investors in crypto, but the smart ones are long gone! I cashed out my gains a while back and have been laughing at the HODL preachers ever since. 
On a serious note - for those who did buy high - many may need the cash sooner than later if there's a recession heading our way. In that case they are wiser to cut their losses now rather than be left holding $1k Bitcoins! 
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:23:52
To truly understand the tech you pretty much need to have a developer background. Outside of that you can have a basic understanding, which is still better than taking a pure punt just because your friends or the media tell you to. 
What I find funny is that you suggested most of the hodlrs understand the tech. In my opinion, most of them have an extremely limited understanding of what the blockchain is, never mind things like segwit or the lightening network. Most came to Bitcoin simply because they saw it going up and wanted to get in on the ride. Most are in the red now - and that's the only the reason the majority hodl. Only a very small percentage of Bitcoin holders will truly believe in the tech, understand blockchain deeply, and thus see a bright future for Bitcoin. 
And if you are one of those, you would see all the flaws in Bitcoin. 
Also - how many here hold Bitcoin and use it for what it was intended for - as a currency? Hardly anyone does that - they all just hold it hoping to one day sell it for a profit. That's not what Bitcoin was supposed to exist for -  but that's exactly why the majority of the people bought Bitcoin in the last 12 months. 
Bitcoin is a pure speculative asset to 95% of holders. Plain and simple. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 09:00:20
From what I'm reading... they are trying to blame the Bitcoin crash on the reason why there is uncertainty in the stock markets! Lol.

Paid shill. No doubt! High on all the cocaine he's been spending his shill funds on! ��
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:11:22
He's definitely making some very valid points. At least Amazon were doing something viable and worthwhile during the dotcom crash. What's Bitcoin doing? All the in-fighting between the various forked communities hasn't helped it's reputation. We also have a big mess over whether or not the lightening network will even work as promised - and even if it does, there are still other altcoins that are far better at being a real digital currency than Bitcoin. 
Bitcoin is not digital gold, far from it. This crypto has no more value than the old Betamax video player that's sitting in my loft. In fact, at least my Betamax video player is sought after as a collectable item now! :-) 
@_date: 2018-03-07 21:46:38

@_date: 2018-02-06 14:07:11
I think your headline is wrong... this is your last chance to SELL before Bitcoin crashes below $5000! 
How many dips have we had in the past 6 weeks??? Are your pockets that deep that you can afford to buy each one? Good luck to you if that's the case. Otherwise I'm just sitting here watching the whales pump up the price a bit more so they can dump again when the SEC have finished their crypto briefing! 
@_date: 2018-02-09 09:03:43
Oh my god... are you blind?! Bitcoin is still going down! Do you honestly believe that mainstream investors who think a 4% drop in their stock is a catastrophe, will move their money over to one of the most volatile asset classes we've seen in decades???!!!
Dream on!
The stock market if anything will bring Bitcoin down even faster. And mark my words - they are already trying to use the Bitcoin crash as a scapegoat for reasoning behind why the stock market is in decline!!!
Watch out below!!!
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:13:45
Most understand the tech? Haha... so you're all developers? 
@_date: 2018-02-07 18:37:53


So you've waited 8 years already... how much longer does the tech behind Bitcoin need to mature? 
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:11:55
You mean when will we lambos? ����
@_date: 2018-02-06 12:11:11
ICO's (majority of which are fraudulent plain and simple) have screwed up Ethereum. That will crash and burn very badly! 
Greed has screwed up Bitcoin. Never forget - you are speculators, pure and simple. You aren't investors. Bitcoin is not some new hot technology anymore - there are plenty of altcoins around now that have FAR greater potential than Bitcoin for mainstream adoption. 
$1000 was the peak of the first big speculative push. That was the height of what it was perceived to be worth just a little over 12 months ago. Bitcoin hasn't moved on since then... so don't be so surprised to see the price of Bitcoin fall back down to the mean of $1000 again. In fact, why should it even be worth $1000? Back in 2016, we didn't have really strong alternatives to Bitcoin. Now we do... so when the markets finally do show some sign of recovery, there is no guarantees that smart money will stay in Bitcoin. 
Bitcoin holders are becoming extremely bitter now. All because you weren't able to buy the lambos you were promised! You've all been played for fools by the big investors - who have been cashing out ever since late December. They all want you to "Buy the dip" because then they can carry on selling their bags without crashing the price even faster. 
You had the balls to get into bitcoin ... a speculative asset that is extremely volatile, and has been proven to crash hard in the past. Do you now have the balls to get out whilst you are still ahead, or at least cut your losses? If not - you could end up holding onto your red blockfolio balances for a lot longer than you think! 
Best of luck! 
@_date: 2018-02-07 22:15:49
Haha. The momentum is slowing already. People aren't going to be so gullible this time around. I see a long long road back up to the ATH this year!
@_date: 2018-02-06 09:28:44
Bitcoin just lost over 60%... and you think investors who are worried about a 5% drop will go to Bitcoin? What are you smoking?! Gold is where they will always go... same as most of the Bitcoin whales too. The only ones left holding big Bitcoin bags will be the bitter HODL'ers or the greedy folk wanting bigger gains so they can buy their lambos!
@_date: 2018-02-08 00:19:48
Tether will totally crash the entire crypto market if it's not stopped fast. They have just artificially pumped it back up again... just like mt Gox was doing prior to their collapse. This is not Good!
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:47:48
The big whales can afford to artificially stem the losses. Also, they need to slow down the rate they are selling so as to be sure people are actually buying... after all - they do need someone to sell to in order to cash out. But at the end of the day - there is a lot more selling going on than buying, and hence it's a bear market - with no sign of an imminent recovery. The 2014 crash wasn't even this bad, and that took 3 years to get back to it's previous ATH! 
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:19:14
Where did you get the figure from? And bitcoin is a pure SPECULATIVE instrument right now. It doesn't hold value beyond what someone is prepared to pay for it. The only reason people wanted to buy bitcoin at $20,000 is because they were conned into believing that it would go up to $100,000 or beyond! Those people have now been burned very badly, and the FOMO is totally gone from the retail investors. Who's going to buy Bitcoin on the way down? Who's going to prop it up? The only people willing to do that are the ones who already hold Bitcoin and think they are getting cheap coins by buying the dip. Well how many dips can you buy? We've had 3 big dips already - anyone who bought those is already deep in the red. I don't think there are many people left willing to save Bitcoin from going all the way down to $1000 or lower. 
Good luck though!
@_date: 2018-02-06 09:25:15
Because gains are gains. We may not see the price come back to the current level for many months. People are just cashing out as they foresee worse times coming. The only ones shouting HODL are either greedy as they want bigger profits, or bitter as they didn't cash out soon enough and are now in the red. 
HODL all you like... Just don't shoot people who are smart enough to leave a sinking ship and jump into life boats!
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:31:33
I've witnessed soooooo many TA "Experts" claiming Bitcoin was going to carry on going up all through December, despite it being obvious to most that it was falling. They thought it was just a small retrace before going on to reach new ATH's. Those same idiots then thought $6k was the absolute bottom, and that we are now in a Bull market. They change their predictions almost daily, simply going with whatever the market manipulators are doing. TA DOES NOT WORK in a heavily manipulated (and unregulated) market like cryptos. It barely works at all in traditional markets - which is why most of the very best traders in the large hedge funds will ROFL at all the geeks studying the charts! 
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:43:15
HAHAHA, don't make me laugh! 
How can they suggest this, whilst also saying it's infecting the wider financial system???
ECB is not your friend - they want to control Bitcoin completely. I mean, it's already been proven that Bitcoin is FAR from decentralised. It will be extremely easy for them and the FED to regulate / tax. Sad to say - Bitcoin is not your key to financial / political / banking freedom, and in my opinion, it never was. Satoshi most likely was a cover for some government agency operation. That's the only real reason why they'd stay anonymous. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:25:32
None of the previous corrections happened around a time of major upset looming in the stock markets or global economy. Who's going to honestly buy Bitcoin whilst it's going down? Not the institutional investors who are already exiting stocks and shares for metals, that's for sure. Not the "dumb" investors - they only want to buy in during the hype, they don't buy FUD. And it won't be the whales either... they will only buy back in if they are sure the institutional investors and dumb money will come flooding back in. With the stock markets in turmoil - whales would be stupid themselves to count on Bitcoin to rise back up so fast this year. 
My advice is to buckle into Fiat or Metals until all the dust settles. The whales and big bag holders have already taken the first lifeboats... only the foolish will be left clinging onto a sinking ship. Alternatively, if the ship doesn't truly sink - it will be like getting a life vest and being forced to swim 100 miles to shore... when you could have got off earlier on a nice comfy lifeboat if only you'd looked up. :-)
@_date: 2018-02-06 18:16:12
That's a nice utopian view to have. Now tell me why governments and banks will adopt Bitcoin rather than their own centrally controlled digital asset? And then explain exactly how banks and governments are simply going to roll over and admit defeat? And if you get that far - explain how you know for certain that Bitcoin was not created by either a government agency, or one of the elite banking families? You think Bitcoin is decentralised? How much power do the mining companies hold over bitcoin? You diehard Bitcoin HODL'ers really need to wake up from you lambo daydream!
@_date: 2018-02-06 10:01:04
Can't argue with that. Crypto won't go away. Only thing is do people really want to buy only to see their returns go red in the first few days? The big investors with lots of disposable cash will happily do so when they feel the timing is right. The average Joe investors won't touch crypto's right now. No chance!
@_date: 2018-02-21 15:43:55

@_date: 2018-02-08 18:00:20
Basically some "expert" blaming the stock market tumble on uninformed idiots. That's exactly what they were blaming the cryptocurrency crash on as well! 
Thing is, just like in cryptocurrency - the majority of shares in the major companies are all owned by a small amount of people. Prices can be manipulated, just like cryptos - just over much longer periods of time. Looks to me like a well orchestrated global recession is on the horizon... you'll need to HODL onto more than your bitcoins if that happens! 
@_date: 2018-02-06 21:23:36
Spoken like a true voice of reason! These fools who go on about believing in the tech and purpose behind Bitcoin as if it's the new mesiah! In reality, there are other altcoins out there that are FAR better than Bitcoin on every way imaginable. If they support the vision behind Bitcoin, then why not go all in on one of the other coins? My answer is that they don't know $hit about how the blockchain really works and wouldn't know a good whitepaper If it slapped them in the face! They bought Bitcoin because they hoped to get rich. Plain and simple. End of. 
@_date: 2018-12-12 17:30:27
I get what you mean about politicians. I don't trust them whatsoever. But sadly bitcoin, Ethereum and all PoW coins are centralized. The whole decentralized scam was invented to get all the government hating peeps on board - and now they can be far more easily tracked! ��
Time for you to learn a thing or two about how bitcoin really works ...
@_date: 2018-12-12 17:09:07
Why so sure? What makes you think the banks will give up their control so easily? And what makes you think bitcoin is even decentralized? As of now, it isn't. 
@_date: 2018-12-13 02:13:29
Fair points... Although the flaw in your argument is the very "inventor" of Bitcoin... Mr Satoshi himself... For he ultimately holds the key to bitcoin's vulnerability. He could have created a back door, or could initiate his own 51% attack. He is a ghost, a fictional character - certainly not a real person in my opinion. Could be the CIA for all we know... What better way to track a new wave of criminals than to have them use bitcoin. And yes, whilst there are things like Monero now - back in the days of silk road who know just how much intel the CIA was able to gain through the use of bitcoin and the dark web??? 
There are many things we don't truly know about bitcoin - and because of that, mainstream financial institutions as well as commerce in general will never come on board with it. They have had ten years now - it would have happened by now if that's what was always intended for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-12-12 15:50:16
Haha... And how sure are you bitcoin won't be worthless in a few years? It's a lottery ticket right now. It may pay out in the future, but odds are against it unless some major changes happen. The only reason the price increases so much last year was manipulation. It had nothing to do with FOMO or the public. 
@_date: 2018-12-12 15:33:12
Bitcoin certainly does NOT tick all the boxes as a store of value. Try telling that to anyone who bought it 12 months ago! No one uses bitcoin as it was intended - which is as a currency. It's not out of the grips of governments either, and will have to be regulated before it has any chance of going mainstream. Bitcoin was just an experiment, nothing more nothing less. Satoshi is just codename. Wake up and smell the coffee. 
@_date: 2018-12-12 17:23:56
Why is it not decentralized? Simple... It is controlled by the mining companies, who in turn are controlled by the government's of the countries they reside in. Plenty more reasons, which you will find out here if you wish to learn...
@_date: 2018-12-12 18:20:04
That's pretty obvious .. the exchanges first and foremost. Then the miners, as they are creating the coins and ultimately have the power to hack / doublespend from only a very small group of them colluding together.

It's not stable however... And unless it's regulated, no one will ever trust it. So it may be seen as a store of value some day, but only by a very tiny minority of the global population for now. 
@_date: 2018-12-19 17:46:20
This is EXACTLY what the neigh sayers were chatting about 12 months ago with the altcoin bull run. There is no such thing as bull traps really in crypto, it's all totally manipulated so standard trading rules don't apply here. If the whales want a nice big fat Christmas dinner for them and all their friends, then this current run will carry on through into next week!!!! And the media will only add fuel to it - no way will they let this all go to waste so soon!
@_date: 2018-12-12 17:37:20
The user's don't control anything. Good luck organising the users of bitcoin and moving them onto another one. They are all free thinking individuals, who get won over by the marketing / FOMO hype they read either on here or see in the mainstream media.

@_date: 2018-12-20 11:46:55
