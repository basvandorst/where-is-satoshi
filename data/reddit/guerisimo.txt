It may be worth looking into alt coins but I would treat btc as a small portion of a diversified portfolio of investments, personally.  You’ve already missed the real money.

I did too, but not every child is as stoked on swimming or a strong swimmer.  People aren’t made to swim.  It’s scary.

Well, let’s start with the fact that he definitely doesn’t understand the consequences of a strong dollar, particularly concerning for someone trying to promote domestic manufacturing.

You know, in the movie this is a sarcastic clap.

What do you want BoA to do?  They get hit with huge fines for being involved in money laundering, and Bitcoin is huge for money laundering.

Because if I buy $100 now and it drops 10% tomorrow I'll feel like a jackass.
I have day trading accounts, but I haven't gotten into crypto yet.  I will at some point.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:49:06
If it doesn’t drop, in the next 2 months I probably just wont buy in ����‍♂️
Too afraid of buying high and selling low.

I cant just go buy a new hockey jersey on ebay from my favorite dude.  He takes CD and USD.  I’ll believe when he takes USD.

My great grandfather was a miner; if I dig up his corpse will there be Dogecoin?
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:26:27
Yeah I get what you're saying.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but currently you get a coin if you're the next to place a block in the chain in addition to the fees, correct?
I get the incentive for mining between fees and coins.
I am curious, through, when an entity like IBM (or really any private enterprise) is working with blockchain, how does a block get added to the chain?  I feel like it'd be absurd to waste CPU power trying to find more blocks, so what's going on there?  Is it just the creation of a chain with an immutable ledger?  If so, why should anyone trust/distrust it?

When I say "day trading" what I actually mean is long positions on blue chips [(and like $150 worth of penny stocks) that happen to be on Robin Hood] and also emerging markets and tech start-up mutual funds (through USAA's brokerage).
I'm not the YOLO AMD MARGIN CALL type of guy.

Of course I look like an idiot when I play it conservative and yall reap 10% rewards, but I can't know that that's going to happen, and I can't intellectually get behind a currency that will have 21 million units in 100 years and is currently worth $10k per coin.
Maybe I'm playing it way, way too conservative, but far more people go broke betting on a "sure thing" than go broke playing it conservative.

I just dont believe that given how hard it is to spend bitcoinf

So even now, there are fees for solving the next block?

Buy high sell low is my enemy.  I can't tell where this is going, but it's a shitty investment to buy a currency at its peak value no matter what school of throught you subscribe to.


This could most certainly be the case.  I don't believe it will be, but I'm getting nearly 10% returns of my current investments so I'm not keen to bail on them.


I just feel like this is a great way to end up buying high and selling low.  I know yall have serious faith in Bitcoin, but I don't.  I do believe decentralized currency is the wave of the future, but I don't think that future is here just yet.
I get what you're saying though.  And I hope you've made a killing off buying into BTC and made me look like a fool for doubting.  I love it when people prove me wrong, because then I've learned something.
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:37:07


I get that.  I'm completely familiar with how bitcoin works, even beyond just "accounts" and "ledgers."  I even get that for each new transactions you need inputs etc.
I also know how the block chain works (though I'm not 100% on why anybody trying to compute the next block would want to include some random person's transaction).


I'll look this up, but can you give me an ELI5?  Is related to how coins are programmable?
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:20:16
Sorry.  Probably should buy high sell low
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:56:46


Yeah, not seeing how these are different


As far as this makes sense, this exactly what someone who would suck Satoshi's dick would say.  


But yall seem to be saying to go all in on BTC, or at least decentralized currencies generally.  I'm all about a diversified portfolio.
I'm a realist when it comes to investor.  Things can't go up forever, and if I'm going to get in while it's high; I'm doing to get in while it's at a valley in terms of its high values.


I'm seriously expecting a drop that will bring it below $1/coin.  I know that's an unpopular opinion here.  I think blockchain is revolutionary.  I think at some point the US will abandon the USD as the reserve currency.  But before that all happens, I think people are going to realize that there are relatively few goods or services you can buy with Bitcoin (it's relatively illiquid all things considered).  I think that will stop it from being much more valuable than it is.
I think that at some point, decentralized, blockchain currencies will take over the world.  Probably this century.  But I'm not going to put my faith (or my IRA) in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:40:29
Im not made of decentralized currencies
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:23:24


I’d like to get in on Bitcoin but this is exactly what is stopping me from buying in.  Well, that and I’m waiting for the price to drop a little again.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:20:54
I dont buy high.  This isnt @_date: 2018-03-12 03:42:36

Good luck dealing with BSA.
@_date: 2018-02-03 20:27:43
How the fuck do you think these companies are supposed to perform BSA compliance and expand their own capabilities in an industry growing this quickly?
Grow up and learn how to invest reasonably.
