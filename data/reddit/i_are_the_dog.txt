He lost because he was a criminal. Also, He has a hell of a ride to the bottom and then starts doing conventions. I work in that industry and it's big bucks.

What's that smell? 
It's me. A stinky trader. Evangelical HODLers aren't helping BTC.
@_date: 2019-03-29 01:20:56
Very apt description. 
I can never resist calling myself a stinky trader though.

There's nothing you can do that's better for your financial future than investing. Invest in BTC as your high-risk. But also look into buying real stock. Your portfolio should be varied. You're young, so I would avoid "dividend Kings" or "champions". Go medium and medium high risk. Look into emerging markets. Read read read and....read.

Noones seen that report but Trump and his BJ buddy Barr. Patience, young Padawan.

How do you do a reminder in Reddit?
@_date: 2018-11-25 21:43:03

@_date: 2018-07-12 12:23:11
What does it mean?
@_date: 2019-09-27 03:10:23
Go back to r/TD with your bullshit.

But the vision
Of 2018's pain, still remains

TIL I learned my dream car is trivial.
@_date: 2019-05-15 00:27:34
Buy 5$ at a time. I know it will take a long time to reach my goal. Worth it
Also, never disclose you have a bunch of BTC.
@_date: 2019-05-14 01:02:13
How do you do the remind-me Reddit bot again?
