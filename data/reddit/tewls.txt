Trollers gonna troll.  The questions were very straightforward and if anything I saw leading questions against classic, not for it.

name one way it could be _more_ efficient.  Bitcoin has specialized hardware and multiple markets with millions traded daily.

believe it or not something doesn't have to sustain itself to be useful.  If services like this cease to exist, truly profitable services will take a hit and thus those services will be incentivized to build services like this.

what are you asking me?  Bitgo is just one off the top of my head and coinkite was one.  Are you implying these things don't exist or something?

Addresses can be single use, they don't have to be.  Also, single use address doesn't prevent this setup in any meaningful way that I can tell.  It would be trivial to make a callback to the wallet owner for a new address on each new payment.

In many states open carry doesn't require a permit. No idea about masks though I would assume it's not illegal

Actually I'm an idiot who misread gitians website and then misread it again in haste because you pissed me off.
You know, it's a lot more helpful for everyone if you just try and educate people instead of being a prick about stuff.
For those wondering, gitian distributes binaries, not actual source code.

if people respond emotionally instead of logically like you've just done - there's literally no way to stop rumors and damaging reputation.

you realize what "worst" means, right?
@_date: 2016-05-07 21:05:01
I didn't realize I had misstated something.  I'm sure in your next post you'll correct my mistake instead of just making rude presumptions.

I can do that.  Gitian allows you to download a verified source for bitcoin - allowing literally anyone and everyone to get the source and modify it to meet their needs.  You don't need commit access to alter bitcoins source.

Cool, neither was the person you replied too.  No one has claimed anything.  Things were given as possibilities and it's absolutely possible Gavin was doing some underhanded shit.  Anyone in a position of power has the ability and motive to do underhanded shit.  Do I think Gavin is being shady?  No, I find it very unlikely, but I'd be a fool to leave possibilities off the table of consideration just because it might trigger someone to fly off the handle emotionally on reddit.
