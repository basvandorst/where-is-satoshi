hm yeah, what's going on with that? not that I mind :p
@_date: 2014-02-27 17:36:42
source? this doesn't look like a DDoS attack at all :)
I did notice my deposit didn't arrive a few hours before they went offline yesterday. so I figured, maybe it's technical problems which they are now fixing. at least I hope so :P would hate to see them go down permanently!

please god no :(

I'm using encryption techniques too (salted sha-256 hashes for the passwords, for example) and I think I'm a pretty trustworthy bitcointalk user myself, as well as an experienced dev :)
@_date: 2013-06-13 19:53:43
That's it :)
(I'm quite sure though that I will make a lot more money by trying to get my site to be widely known as a quality service, than by scamming people!)
@_date: 2013-06-13 18:55:29
Because I'm a super innocent and cool guy! But seriously, there's little I can do to convince people of my trustworthiness.. I guess this is an issue with any site though!
@_date: 2013-06-13 19:04:45
Why couldn't the qcl.me devs just replace the encrypted addresses with their own encrypted addresses? You'd still have to trust them..
@_date: 2013-06-28 15:12:33
Yeah, but that would get a bit too convoluted.. I do have different addresses for both albums though :)
@_date: 2013-12-17 16:10:15
and a little less known, but I've used it a few times and seems to work fine:  (advantage is you can sometimes buy cheaper btc there via bitstamp)
@_date: 2013-06-28 03:35:27
Comments/criticism also more than welcome :)
@_date: 2013-06-28 04:34:09
Thanks! :D
I shall try to debug that firefox thing tomorrow.. Not sure how much I can do though (it's some javascript player plugin) :)
@_date: 2013-12-08 04:54:58
or rather, the opposite of this.
@_date: 2013-06-13 19:32:42
Haha, I wish I had 200 btc! If I did, I wouldn't have to ask for donations ;)
How do you know that reddit devs have the technical skills to ensure that they aren't hacked and your password doesn't get stolen? In the end, everything is made by people, and trust in them has to be built over time.
(Funny how all my posts keep getting downvoted. I've done my best to create a useful service and all I get is criticism? *any* site that gets some private data (like passwords) from you can abuse them. Including reddit, imgur, wth, even stuff like google mail.)

As a dutchie, I can confirm all this :) I recently got some beers delivered to me through thuisbezorgd.nl using 'sixpack beer service' with btc, worked great :D hmmmm beerrrrr
@_date: 2013-06-13 20:45:02
- support for more cointypes than most of those, probably
- sexy, clean interface. (matter of taste, though, obviously)
@_date: 2013-06-28 14:36:48
Haha that's correct.. how did you know :p
@_date: 2013-06-13 20:47:57
what's that, did he get hacked? or was he a scammer? i'd never dare to set up an exchange, way too risky for me :)
@_date: 2013-06-28 14:26:47
Also a very good idea, added to todo :)
@_date: 2013-06-28 14:55:06
I have 2 more albums, but the first one is from ~2000 and kinda amateurish, and the latest one from a few years ago is a bit chaotic - there's a lot of different styles on it. May consider adding that one anyway later on :)
I don't think a lot of people on soundcloud use bitcoins yet but when I'm in a less lazy state I shall add my addy anyway, you never know! :D
@_date: 2013-06-29 03:47:17
Thanks for the person who donated me 3.1337 bitcents on both my albums! :D Now that's stylish!
@_date: 2013-06-14 15:28:12
Your faith in qcl.me's encryption techniques is as cute as it is naive :p
