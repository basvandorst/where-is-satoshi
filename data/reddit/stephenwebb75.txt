Probably because so many users get banned despite being crypto advocates
@_date: 2017-02-09 16:51:13
Their posts on this sub get deleted/"modded to prevent spamming"
@_date: 2017-02-13 07:25:18
Yeah! Especially when the 10 accepted $70+ million from financial firms to make commits on an open source project... Super more cypherpunk!!

Well I'm glad that's settled. Alright, well then, let's call it a return to a blocksize determined by transaction demand, just like how bitcoin has functioned for its entire existence up until we ran into the 1mb blocklimit. That way users don't have to pay 30sat/byte while off chain transactions continue to develop. Market based solutions are generally more effective than arbitrary limits enforced by leadership tied to business models reliant on off chain transactions. Being cornered into a solution by deliberating enforcing such limits don't jive well with many other community members, so I (among others) consider the eventual removal of this arbitrary method of governing blocksize a significant step in scaling, even if it doesn't allow 6000 transactions/second

The same emergent consensus was in effect until we ran into the 1mb limit that was implemented for an entirely different reason

I admire your encouragement of further research, but you're not offering much to dispel this "myth". I actually have been looking for a concrete link to better illuminate this distinction, and admittedly haven't found it in my 10mins of search. Perhaps spam limit was a less than effective descriptor, DDOS filter? The only information I'm finding refers to the discussion of the blocksize limit being added in 2010 to prevent a malicious miner from creating a 20tb blocks to clog nodes 
@_date: 2017-03-19 16:16:49
Blocks were sized based on transaction volume. I'll admit emergent consensus usually refers to setting the limit, but same idea. Miners made blocks according to transaction demand, not an arbitrary spam limit that its author intended to change down the road

It finally seems to be ending

Bitfinex just announced a coming ~"early coin split position"~ (as I'm going to vaguely callout of memory) this morning(? maybe yesterday). Kind of a tall order for the required conditions to be met and paid out, but another prediction markets is exciting
@_date: 2017-03-07 01:31:07
How would you define brigading? Do you mean people supporting BU? Because as my first post in this thread suggests: comments offering BU any support as a scaling option were previously removed
@_date: 2017-03-19 16:23:38
As a current frequent user, I would disagree on it being harmful
@_date: 2017-03-18 21:45:58
I'm not sure I understand your use of "attack", conflict of interest among the participants involved in the game theorized protocol? Because a hash vote for a software implementation sounds like essential bitcoin operation to me. Solution: "Fork off the chain if you don't like it" as is don't follow their fork?
@_date: 2017-03-06 23:17:05
Which community is brigading over here? The former members of this sub whose posts were systematically removed? Who's you guys? I've been on this sub for years 
Edit: wrong who's
@_date: 2017-03-18 16:35:12
So discussion of changing the blocksize was publicly prohibited from this sub as a suggestion of altcoin discussion, but changing PoW isn't?? Am I crazy to think this would necessitate a drastic hardfork? Where you at This sub gets more hilarious by the day. I'm sure such drastic measures wouldn't affect bitcoin's share of the market cap (/s)
@_date: 2017-03-15 15:35:35
Miners don't run nodes. Miners running a BU client instead of core's client isn't a simple toggle
Edit:subject clarification
@_date: 2017-03-19 16:22:14
I don't have a date(mobile + lazy), but the limit was emplaced years before 1mb was even close to being reached. Satoshi is often quoted too for mentioning removing it later when network became robust. Much more detail to read on it than I can recall
@_date: 2017-03-19 18:18:32
I'll agree there's limitless game theoretical implications for a change in finding consensus on max block size, but there isn't a status quo for this space, and leaving block size to the political machinations of github commit access and client warring holds an immensity of shift to the game theory on its own. I prefer this defined governance mechanism over dancing around 1mb in fear of overstepping an arbitrary threshold

Careful with the answers you get from here,  the world of open source crypto has been under constant siege of power grabs. Especially the original bitcoin github repository and focal places of communication. Those who've been around long enough would point out all the propaganda aligned with the core team whom also have close relations with the strict moderation of this sub (and manage bitcoin.org not .com) This post is particularly in regards to an upgrade the creator wrote about as a necessary later change that the current holder of the core team reigns disagree with
@_date: 2017-10-06 15:43:52
I only indicate that the narrative allowed in this sub is heavily moderated
@_date: 2015-04-24 20:13:47
I'm not offering a specific source on that "billions", just supposed to vaguely represent the varied approximations of the size of the industry. Even with an expectation of the technology's imminent demise, the space is saturated with money and time spent developing its adoption.
@_date: 2017-10-06 17:14:57
It sounds like you're lumping me in with an "opposing force" you've personally compiled. I'm as organic of a crypto follower as you get. Subscribed to r/bitcoin when Gavin and Mike Hearn were still involved. I mentioned r/btc because that sub doesn't moderate the dialogue, which I abhor to witness here.
Have I wronged you internet friend? I want bitcoin or the best open source medium of decentralized peer to peer exchange to come to widespread use across the globe, I would hope we can find common ground there.
I'm not involved in any organized efforts like a "dragon's den" campaign, or "on Ver's payroll". I think it's hilarious to suggest that Ver and Jihan coordinate, or even agree on much.
The vitriol woven into your post is toxic for the crypto ecosystem, I'd ask you engage in discourse with more civility

The New York Times just claimed an overall market value of around $2 billion, im on my phone so I'm having a hard time linking it, but check out the article talking about development in Argentina near the end.

"Failed for so long"
What precisely are you comparing bitcoin with? You're going to have to define your versions of "failed" and "so long" to clarify this for me. Billions of dollars invested in a protocol introduced by a anonymous paper within the past seven years doesn't quite line up with that kind of claim. 
@_date: 2016-05-19 18:02:53
Still an open source environment, who says they invented it?
I don't have a strong opinion on either side, I just felt this post felt relevant and from an under-represented line of thought for this sub

Arguably there's a variety of strategies relating to tax reporting and the choice to participate in other industry specific taxes. IE buying across state borders or online to dodge state specific sales taxes, or dealing under the table noncommercially
