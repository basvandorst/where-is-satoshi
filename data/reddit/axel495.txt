"trading" digital currency lmao
this digital currency "trading" is just gambling. I only use btc for transactions and  I always avoid holding btc and try to spend them as quickly as possible due to its volatility.

market cap is established by fundamentals. 
holders and speculators are nothing but cockroaches. they disperse easily. they help increasing liquidity, but when the underlying is garbage, they will flee nevertheless. 
it is fucking pathetic whenever I come to this sub, only to see front page full of these retarded gamblers' self-help thread. all these "hold forever never sell" threads. So sick of these retards.
And I am from fucking wallstreetbets sub. This speaks volumes to just how retarded the folks here are.

being able to buy coffee is where real value of currency is.
right now even BTC is only 1% market cap of GOLD. It's a long way to go.
When average joe can spend crpto like cash, it's the real threat to central banking and government control. 
The vast vast majority of transactions in this world is small transactions like grocery shopping. BTC will never become mainstream without such capability, and BTC is doomed because it's technology is never built on that, it has no scability.
That's why Dash will change the game. It's instant and low fees, all those values promised by bitcoin, but now lost.

This kind of mentality is exactly why bitcoin will never become mainstream. Digital cash my ass. You can spend cash at local Walmart and farmer's market. Can you do it with bitcoin? Covering up bitcoin's total failure by arguing it's digital "cash" is laughable and pathetic.

just because a currency is traded doesn't mean it has to be unstable, you little retarded fuck. 
A $100 USD note 10 years ago would still worth like at least $90 today in purchasing power. Bitcoin? A 10% move would be fucking intra-day fluctuation. No fucking retail business likes that. The fact btc was $3000 not too long ago and now barely holding $2000 speaks volumes.
Fucktards holding btc back by supporting shits like "segwit".
fuck bitcoin. full of fucking retarded cancers who know nothing about basic economics.

Volatility is a huge factor on why bitcoin is not widely adopted.
It's funny seeing all these retards on this sub speculating on bitcoin. All these "hold the line NEVER EVER SELL" threads all betting on bitcoin increases on value hugely in the near future.
They don't understand the value of a currency is not that it's always going up, but stability. 
But hey, this sub is full of these retarded fucktards.
Segwit will not resolve bitcoin problem. 2mb block is still ridiculously small. 
Bitcoin's historical purpose (by introducting digital currency) is complete. It's a failure coming forward, and need to be replaced by something much better.

litecoin is not fast enough. 2.5 minutes block time will not buy you any coffee. Grocery transactions need to be instant. 
Dash is the real future. It's instant and also has way more privacy than bitcoin and litecoin.
Monero is even better at privacy but it has scaling issues and higher fees and time than Dash. But it's superb privacy is king and will be widely adoped by dark net.
Basically the future is Monera (as gold, asset that hold value) + Dash (as silver, you pay stuffs including food and drinks with it). BTC and litecoin gonna be less and less popular and eventually phased out.
