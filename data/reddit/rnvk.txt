The hardware is more polished on KeepKey then Trezor, it would be much harder to replace the guts on an Evil Maid Attack.

Not opposed to blocksize increase, just don't think 20 is where we should go. Which btw, is most of the consensus on the mailing list.

Hi, from Coinkite here. Just curious, did you ever [contact support]( 
1. [Yes, it's free.]( We only limit the amount of wallets per account. You can sweep unlimited amounts into multisig.
2. Correct. What's the use case? it's not written in stone.
3. [Our site is very fast on Tor]( we test this constantly. It's probably your circuit, have you tried changing it? Are you using VPN/SOCKS on top of onion? Just remember though, Tor is slower than clear net. 
@_date: 2015-12-02 20:41:54
Yes, but only to addresses related to Coinkite wallets, including watch-only, multisig or standard.
@_date: 2015-12-20 14:54:12

I do, last two years. I give preference to business that take bitcoin and for everything I use my Amex then pay it using spendbt.com. The only thing I need fiat for that doesn't take Amex is hydro and isurance, I just exchange for those.
There are a lot of people like me in Toronto.
@_date: 2015-06-23 02:48:22
I haven't tried either, but you already can auto forward bitcoin from Coinkite to any address. Some do that with coinlocks.
@_date: 2015-06-16 00:22:01
If you want to just get going, checkout this [Python bitcoin API]( also available via pip. If you want to get more into doing it all yourself I suggest taking a look at Pycoin.

Here is the easiest possible way

Few ideas:
- create a bip38 paper wallet and laminate.
- create a [multisig wallet and backup the keys.](
- get a [ledger wallet]( (30EUR)

You can do that with Coinkite sms  and watch only

Why is Coinkite not listed as a real wallet? It's as real as it gets you can own your private keys, and even generate them offline. And much more uptime and better support than some of the alternatives. 
@_date: 2015-06-23 22:53:57
The OP literally talks about Coinkite, so the link I was to help you understand where you maybe myopic. What's not cool is you not painting the whole picture. If you actually took the time to understand what Coinkite offers you wouldn't be so fast to dismiss it. Please read all the [FAQs]( or ask questions, we have to answer them.
Coinkite has being in business for over 2 years, championing privacy, offering what ever is possible to make bitcoin safe and easy. And ultimately gives multiple options to users to make their own decisions on convenience/security.
Ps: we literally have a choice box the explains the security concerns about each way of creating the keys for multisig.

Cool tees, the MineBitcoin is awesome!
Just need bitcoin payment option on the actual checkout :P
@_date: 2015-06-08 16:12:21
Support is important to us :)
1. Create a [multisig wallet]( then when you [sweep set]( that as the target.
2. I will add a note to discuss internally about maybe adding this option. 
3. We would love to troubleshoot this, It's possible you are tripping our defences. It would be of great help if you emailed us support when you have a chance so that we can diagnose that.

Here is an extremely easy one to add to the site 
@_date: 2015-06-02 20:46:24
Take a look at [Coinkite]( it can do [watch-only and sweeps]( [multisig, multisig with multiple users, up to m-of-15 with option for any/all keys be generated offline]( [multisig with ledgers]( good support, lots of features, notifications and great API.

On that note, avoid Authy too, putting 2FA online defeats it's purpose.
@_date: 2015-06-04 18:49:22
There should be, I think there was a site called btcescrow or something like that. Also, a few of our users setup a [coinkite multisig 2-of-3 wallet]( and invited the buyer/seller and an arbitrator. Then on a co-sign page (leaks no user info) users can agree/sign transactions, I think it's easier if the seller initiates.

You can do that with Coinkite, via email, sms or pick up link. It's cool because they don't need to already have a wallet, it's essentially a link with a PIN. And if they already do they can redeem to any address. Here is the SMS example, it's the same for email 
@_date: 2015-06-30 13:34:37
Yes, you can use with any of your wallets. It leverages the fact that both our [simple]( or [multisig wallets](  are BIP32 and just generates new addresses without needed the private keys! You can also [automatically forward the a %]( to a different bitcoin address.
@_date: 2015-06-07 13:56:14
Not true, if you use Coinkite's multisig you are safe from all those scenarios.  Read more here

Already there. From the button edit page, just leave the amount empty.

They certainly can. But this generates an invoice with new addresses for each customer, automatically calculates the exchange rate, and sends a payment confirmation to the site's shopping cart system.

No it's impossible to go fractional reserve in our technical design, as all transactions are blockchain transactions, and they are all auditable by the users, coins are all in separate keys. Imagine a hosted version of blockchain.info wallet.
@_date: 2014-12-15 18:33:25
Correct, but the [offline key generator is]( and you can also use any other generator of you choice. 
**Then you don't have to upload the private key, only the the xpubkey eliminating trust.**

Yes, if they pay with Coinkite's card, its instant, if they pay with other wallets you have the option of how many confirmations you prefer. It also display's a list of open transactions on screen.

You can fork it, and make it work with any other API.
@_date: 2014-01-08 15:37:05
There is nothing wrong with phone wallets, but most people want ease-of-use and support. They don't want to deal with security, backup and availability.
With Coinkite all your coins are available 24/7 from all devices. Unlike other web wallets, funds are allocated and verifiable in the blockchain — we can't re-invest it.
It's a web wallet, so it enables us to offer a whole bunch of other features, such as send by email, vouchers, notifications, access to our payment terminals and debit card, and more...
We also offer Litecoin support.

But Square is inherently flawed, mag strips are unsafe and are consider higher risk transactions. Very easy to skim, in most places outside north america chip and pin is the norm.

No there is no IOU, and no need for the terminal on the other end. All it does is facilitate secure bitcoin but/sell via paper wallets, vouchers, etc... 
It operates the bitcoin way, there is no lock in for the consumer.

**No lock in** was very important to the "Bitcoin Way" that Coinkite committed to, you can **automatically forward the funds to any Bitcoin Address.** (Off course you have to have a Coinkite account to use the API)

That's why we have the **onion address**. It's goes around cloud flare, unfortunately all Bitcoin websites need heavy duty anti DDOS protection.

If the user uses Coinkite cards it can be done with zero confirmations. Also, retailers can choose how many confirmations they would like for standard QR transactions. It immediately shows on the network, for low value items the risk is very low.

Sure, just always remember someone could be in the middle if you don't have a trusted SSL tunnel.
@_date: 2014-10-29 20:56:40
Yes, there is no perfect solution. 
@_date: 2014-10-08 20:26:13
Trezor requires a USB/Web bridge, is not that simple. 
You could ask them to plug Coinkite's API into mytrezor.com
1. You could import individual private keys into Coinkite 
2. or watch the trezor's bitcoin address to get notifications. 
3. soon sign multi-sig transactions.
@_date: 2014-11-29 22:06:13
Different purposes; there are many reasons why you would want to use Tor (onion), including privacy. Another issue with HTTPS is that you have to trust a CA.
You should never use onion addresses that were not distributed wrapped in a signature, like this:
    -----BEGIN BITCOIN SIGNED MESSAGE-----
    
    -----BEGIN SIGNATURE-----
    1GPWzXfpN9ht3g7KsSu8eTB92Na5Wpmu7g
    H14Bs/jfRs3mTFKiBAj2yWkqWKGPJwW82I2Po/wWN/dsFXZApXLq7M5ioRrkEP0MMPsjGb3knIQXaO6FN+rdRu0=
    -----END BITCOIN SIGNED MESSAGE-----
@_date: 2014-11-27 15:08:11
Just use [**multi-signature with keys generated offline**]( then you up the game.
A good way to start:
1. Multisig-Signature
2. Generate the majority of the keys offline.
3. 2FA (Google Authenticator, don't use something like Authy) 
4. Set limits and Notifications

We only started pre-ordering the second option a few days ago, and previously many retailer bought the exchange. Both are selling, different people different needs :)

Coinkite supports exactly that, you can create a new Multisig address where each party controls 1 key
@_date: 2014-02-19 15:39:53
Yes, we are not a free wallet and holding large amounts costs in security and support.
In regards to the 50%, that's not correct, please check the pricing page, we made it more clear.
@_date: 2014-08-06 16:24:22
Yes you can send it however you want, you do need a Coinkite account to create a API key.
@_date: 2014-11-18 17:49:24
I think you can help answer this one.
@_date: 2014-11-18 19:34:09
1. There are **no limits** on funds deposited on multisig. 
2. Yes, our API wrappers and other open source projects are here **
@_date: 2014-11-29 21:51:03
Different things. 
1. VPN basically by-passes your ISP. I.e.: bypasses your employer firewall, who may be blocking Tor traffic.
2. Onion addresses create a secure connection between you and the web server with no third party CA certificate authority). I.e.: bypasses a CDN like cloud-flare who theoretically could be doing MITM to your https.
Both are very useful and serve different purposes.

We (Coinkite) will have more information soon, for now I've setup this subscription list 
@_date: 2014-12-09 18:41:02
We would like to point out that we don’t consider wise to hold private keys in the browser’s cookies, bookmarks, or “local storage”. There are just too many untrustable browser extensions, and it’s hard to know what Javascript you are running. Our approach uses more conventional, and very simple files, so that you can get your head around where the sensitive data resides. By  publishing standalone (single file) helper tools, we support using isolated computers for signing and key management purposes.
A standing problem with encryption software is how do you know they are actually encrypting your data with your key? It’s not possible to tell one type of high-entropy data apart from another. Our answer to this problem is open standards, and leveraging the installed base of OpenSSL CLI programs already out there. By supporting OpenSSL AES-CBC-256 compatible encryption, we can create files that you can verify yourself are encrypted with the algorithm we say they are.
We do not store the passphrase protecting this HSM key. You’ll need the passphrase to authorize transactions, and if you forget that passphrase, the key will be useless. We offer an on-screen password hint which can be helpful, but there is no means to reset or recover this passphrase.
**You don't have to trust us, you can generate your own BIP32 extended private key by whatever means meet your privacy expectations. Upload only the BIP32 public key (xpub) into Coinkite.** (or use this tool we provide 
You can read more here 
@_date: 2014-12-08 15:49:31
Thanks doe adding, just a note we are not a Bank, you can control your own private keys with Multisignature, you don't even need to give us more than the xpubkey (extended public key).
@_date: 2014-08-06 19:40:40
Nice catch, fixed. Caching might take time to update.
@_date: 2014-07-18 13:07:06
It means the application is watching the blockchain for payment confirmation and will give a call back to which ever system is integrated with it.
@_date: 2014-12-09 23:26:08
@_date: 2014-12-09 19:16:53
**We don't trust the browser.**
If you don't trust us, you can just upload your own xpub key, this way there is nothing under our control :)
@_date: 2014-12-07 21:44:58
It's on the todo list. We do support "bitcoin:" URLs, we also have a Web QR scanner, if not good enough there is a field for you to paste any type of bitcoin transaction.
@_date: 2014-01-03 17:42:56
Nothing wrong with Electrum, great app. But it is not online available from any device for you, doesn't support multiple currencies, doesn't let you send money by email, etc...
We are not a bank, your funds are allocated on a private key generated for you inside our HSM.
There are many good free services out there. However, if you want a service that can push the technology and offer great support, you need money to pay for it.
Coinkite offer incredible support, is pushing the tech further with the most advanced BIP32 web wallet, doesn't sell your information, doesn't display ads and doesn't re-invest user's money. We respect user's privacy so much, that we don't even use Google Analytics on internal pages.
@_date: 2014-01-24 23:19:42
From Coinkite here, 
All internal Coinkite transactions are blockchain transactions, 
we are nothing like the other wallets, please read our FAQs. 
You can actually download a CSV with all transactions on your account and verify on blockchain explorer.
Our system talks to any other wallet to send and receive.
We provide, easy of use, security, support and hardware. I think there is some value there.

Take phone out of the pocket &gt; pin &gt; unlock &gt; open app wallet &gt;pin &gt; unlock &gt; tap receive &gt; display address.
Card take wallet out &gt; display card.
My dream is not to have to deal with a phone to be able to buy things in brick and mortar. As you can tell i really like Chip+PIN for physical world. For online, we will be launching some easy solutions attached to your web wallet very soon!
PS: Debit card networks are not setup to deal with bitcoin in the bitcoin way. Meaning they can debit a an account, but they can transact in the blockchain at all. Out terminals are very different, they even generate new BIP32 addresses for each payment.
@_date: 2014-03-14 13:08:49
These are not web servers, they are machines that only talk to the web server and only sign transactions. Keys never see the light of day.

    - WIF format (Wallet Import Format) — recommended.
    - Hexadecimal, Base64 or Base6 (dice rolls)  of the secret exponent.
    - BIP38 Encrypted private keys. You’ll need to know the passphrase of course.
- Watch Only Address Support
    - Also as a multiple keys in one total.

We (Coinkite) are not an exchange, but still trusted with user funds and we believe it should all be transparent. Also, user's funds are allocated and segregated to their own BIP32 HD keys.
On Coinkite you can download a report, you can just verify against the blockchain.

This terminal is aimed at brick and mortar exchanges, which have different needs and higher purchasing power than retailers. It allows them to run btc sales without trusting their employees with full access to the wallet, paper trail, accounting, etc... 
What makes the machines so expensive is the QR laser scanner and free GPRS already included.
The good news is that it's catching on, hundreds sold, specially in South Asia for remittance.

Just to clarify 3 things.
1. We use a completely open protocol: Bitcoin. There is no lock in with the funds, in fact we make easy and automated to move them out if you so choose.
2. We are selling, and have avoided VC funding because we are profitable. 
3. Our customers love our services and products. Because we have a sustainable business model (not free), we offer superior support and technology. We even have competitors who use our technology ;)

Sorry if the FAQ was not clear, 
You can generate your private key offline and only upload the public key. this way even if Coinkite goes away you still have access to your bitcoins. 
This post explains it better

Yes, it's all done in the *bitcoin way* you can forward funds to any bitcoin address. 
Right now there is no scheduler though, but that's a great idea, we will definitely add to the todo list.
We are also looking into implementing the "Payment protocol" which is being defined to support
payments and recurring payments.

Not much, transactions are public on the blockchain. And with tor we wouldn't know your IP.

No. 
Coinkite doesn't offer any exchange, the merchant can forward coins to an exchange of their liking automatically if he/she desires. 
Customer funds/wallets are in allocated keys for each user (No IOU). And terminals use the keys owned by the user/merchant. All internal transactions are blockchain transactions, including vouchers, sms, email sends, within the customer's keys and the receiver keys and vice-versa.
Since the beginning, we've retained a one of the largest law firms in Canada and keep a tab on it.

No fiat exposure to protect our users, this is how we chose to make our system.

If you mean coins, from the wallet or pulled from an exchange via API.
@_date: 2014-07-09 16:47:03
We are actually not competitors in most of our services, we offer wallets, debit cards, Points of Sale/Exchange Machines and Vault as a Service. Bitpay does conversion to fiat for many of our customers.
And yes, at this point cooperation if to the benefit of all of us. Better Bitcoin products/services means more adoption, which means more business :)

Hi Klazzik, 
From Coinkite here. 
1. Translation is a massive undertaking, and messes up with adding new features fast as they need to be translated as well. For now google translate does the job, yes i know it's not ideal. But we are adding new features on a daily base, so until the we slow down, native translation will take a back sit.
2. We don't offer online merchant tools, but will this year. In regards to verification, we don't require it as we don't convert funds into Fiat, we do provide you with an Auto Forward feature that would make your life very easy. You need to understand, that most companies that offer fiat conversion, require verification because of financial AML/KYC laws, it's not up to them. If you want privacy and Bitcoin to grow, stop converting it, and start convincing your suppliers to accept crypto.

"It" means that the integration can be done with Coinkite's wallet API and no need for the physically terminal, many are even using the API with their ATMs made by other manufactures. Large POS manufactures are not interested in Bitcoin at this point. 
Another reason why this terminals are selling a lot is because they can be used as ATMs, they print vouchers and paper wallets.

Tor explicitly adds hops in the middle, that means if you are not extremely careful with the https  certificate it could be more easily spoofed by a rogue node.

Yes, exactly the onus is on them, there is no point in paying this POS companies to integrate since there are hundreds of thousands of them spread over multiple countries. They have to be replaced by better and more forward solutions. Why don't you pay for a large player in Atlanta to integrate your favorite Bitcoin solution? I will answer that for you; because there is no business model to recover the cost there without downstreaming it to the merchant in fees.

We don't generally show Beta code to the public at Coinkite. 
That said, it's still a good idea to deposit a small amount, withdraw it all, and work up to larger amounts **because you will be handling the keys partly on your own.** 
As for trezor, we haven't investigated much, but we think it's likely easy to generate the xpubkeys, but impossible or very hard to sign the actual proposed transactions. That makes it useless for this purpose.

They offer a good service, but they are MSBs which come with come obligations.
Coinkite has a very complete API.

Great post.

That's great! More apps only make the bitcoin ecosystem better. Check out [this api]( it might make it easier to start, there are also a few open source examples there.

It's always a balance of Ease-of-use vs Security, different people need different solutions.

Those are great devices but you can't use them on the phone. have a payment page, auto forward funds, get notifications, send bitcoin via SMS/email, private key sweep, multi-user multi-signature etc... 
There is a lot that can be done with a web wallet. I think both Hardware and Software wallets have a place. BTW, is working on integrating H.W1 on Coinkite

Both questions; only for the terminal owner.

The new ‘Starter’ plan has unlimited balance on multisig. So just login, create a new multisig account and deposit there and it's free :)
@_date: 2014-11-27 15:58:34
thx :)
@_date: 2014-12-09 17:34:46
**100% free** now. Hot-wallets have limits and Multisig accounts are unlimited deposit!
@_date: 2014-10-30 16:47:18
Keys should be generated offline.
@_date: 2014-01-28 16:19:12
You don't need to do it, but the fact that is available is key. This mean that your funds are where Coinkite says it is. 
@_date: 2014-08-05 13:50:32
Merchants can [pay $30/mo and have **unlimited free transactions**.]( You'd be surprised how fast new merchants are buying this terminals.
There is a cost to developing and maintaining this technology, **including FREE international GSM out of the box.**
@_date: 2014-12-15 17:21:06
Not sure about the rest, but all transaction signing at [Coinkite]( uses determistic K value (&amp; therefore R) per [RFC6979]( 
And, afik is the only Bitcoin company that uses HSMs to generate and sign secp256k1. 
Use open standards!
@_date: 2014-08-06 18:30:20
They don't need the link, you can give the voucher number only. Email us connect at coinkite dot com and we can discuss/track your idea, it will get lost here.

Sorry, i missed this question.
We built the system in a way, that if the merchant doesn't make the terminal public we can only tell the country – Some that have lots; Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, Holand, UK, Jersey, Germany, Canada, Japan, China, Philippines, India, Sweden, France, Italy, New Zealand and Russia.

@_date: 2014-01-03 18:30:26
Welcome to Coinkite!
Our node is fast, so we know pretty quickly about unconfirmed transactions, you can see them in the account history.
We will let you order them very soon, just check the box.
As per third party using the payment network, it's very likely that will happen, but it will take sometime.
@_date: 2014-11-26 19:56:15
Using multi-signature with keys generated offline is one of the most secure things you can do.

Thanks, we actually sell more to retailers these days, they want an easy, familiar and robust way of accepting Bitcoin. 
They all tell us that tablets are great in principle, but fail miserably with the retail hardware abuse. 
Also, if the customer uses a Coinkite card instead of their phone to pay, they can't trust 0 confirmations and complete.
We are already working on some other features in terms of m-of-n and escrow. Right now we are focused on what retailer really need.

Ben (owner) was the one who setup the terminal.
@_date: 2014-02-13 15:27:21
Very much, there is logic to make sure you need Manager PIN/Card for some operations, if stolen can be turned off, coins are on coinkite.com, not on the terminal.

It's nice to have the card because then you don't need the phone.

Coinkite does not convert, and encourages it's merchants to operate in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-12-09 19:13:52
All he said! 
And thank you. 
To others; the best way to sleep at night is to trust only the crypto, generate your own BIP32 extended private key by whatever means meet your privacy/security expectations. 
Then upload only the BIP32 public key (xpub) into Coinkite. 
We provide a open source tool  which you can audit. These are open standards, there are many other key generation options out there that would work with our setup.
PS: please let us know any other improvements we can make.

1. Yes, its up to the retailer how much risk he wants. For a coffee shop selling 2 bucks coffee there isn't much risk, for more expensive they can wait longer.

Cool, will check it out soon.

- Up to 15, it could also be 1-of-1 where the key is not even in Coinkite's control. 
- Many companies use Coinkite, giving each staff 1 key, so that with a minimum of for example two people signing funds can get out. This way you can have easy access to a single wallet used by for example 15 people. 
- You could also give keys to different computers for API automation. Endless possibilities :) 
- Coinkite has public co-sign pages, so that multiple parties don't need a Coinkite account.
- You don't have to worry anymore about trust

You could repurpose this open source code 
@_date: 2014-12-10 20:44:24
Most of your asks are possible, but it would require some changes to the original code. Email us at support at coikite dot com. I'm not sure we can do all of them soon as we are super busy, but we might be able to point you in the right direction.

We pay for the miner's fee at Coinkite.

Our (Coinkite) customer Stoney Creek Roaster tweeted this video today :)
here is their profile 
@_date: 2014-11-27 15:55:02
Hi, have you tried the new Coinkite Multisig implementation? [M-of-15 and option for generating keys completly offline]( eliminating the need for trust.
@_date: 2014-02-28 19:19:56
Cool, if you have any issues, just email support we answer pretty quick within business hours.
@_date: 2014-08-05 13:36:00
Actually, [Coinkite's terminals]( can handle transactions from and to any other wallet. 
Integration can be done with the [Coinkite's API](
This post assumes that that those companies want to make integration happen easily.
Another reason why this terminals are selling a lot is because they can be used as ATMs, they print vouchers and paper wallets.
@_date: 2014-04-29 18:34:29
Great idea. Something to consider for the next round of updates to this feature.
@_date: 2014-10-13 15:20:06
Here is $5 bucks worth for you to play with, pm me for the PIN.

1. There are a few different ways. The easiest is to generate one with the Coinkite offline generator  or you can upload your own bip32 HD public keys (xpubkey). 
2. Yes, but it is still a prototype  The guys from are working on making it easier.
@_date: 2014-12-09 19:38:24


We are not charging you anything.
@_date: 2014-10-02 20:21:41
It's is a great product, I agree. But the problem is; you need a computer you own with you in order to use it. 
PS: I have one: 
@_date: 2014-03-10 22:03:02
Coinkite does that :)
@_date: 2014-11-18 16:44:02
I think you will be please with today's announcement :)
@_date: 2014-10-21 18:13:59

You have to get your own licenses. 
@_date: 2014-10-01 20:47:47
Force of habit. 
@_date: 2014-01-11 19:36:03
You can pay with any other wallet, the terminal can print a bitcoin address on the bill. It can also scan QRs.
@_date: 2014-12-15 17:09:57
In regards to Coinkite:
- Always used the right spec. "RFC6979" and, afik is the only Bitcoin company that uses HSMs to generate and sign secp256k1
- You don't need to get email to confirm transaction
- You don't need to share your private keys, you have an options to generate them yourself, offline and only upload the public keys.

Rodolfo from Coinkite here, part of my background is UX that's one of the reasons why Coinkite is so damn easy to use for a BIP 32 wallet. And there is a ton more to come.
@_date: 2014-12-17 20:22:38
Take a look at this one  
@_date: 2014-11-18 14:44:50
Happy to answer any questions!
@_date: 2014-02-21 16:29:34
Yes, our wallet is already BIP32.
@_date: 2014-12-10 20:06:22
The reason why multisig is so nice is because you can spread risk, meaning you don't have a single point of failure.
You can do it yourself with something OpenSource like Coinbin or use a service like Coinkite, which also let's you upload your own private keys and/or backup. [Read more here](

Do you have a monthly account? If you do it's on the mail.
@_date: 2014-11-18 15:35:36
We are using P2SH and multisig transactions the same as everyone else, and we tried to interop with others, but it's not easy. They problems are discussed [in the FAQ]( Key generation is open and interop with brainwallet and bip32.org
We've added this to help you with that.


















@_date: 2014-12-16 16:59:45
If you haven't shared the key with Coinkite, then you would have to sign the transaction offline. This post should help clarify 
@_date: 2014-06-26 14:18:13
Thanks! We are trying to make a fun event for people to work on projects they been wanting to do. This will be a friendly event, and projects will be judged on technical merits not on business viability.

Hi yes, just add the addresses as watch only on Coinkite.com the. Use the API to display it.
@_date: 2014-01-09 16:31:29
The using for free is the least of our worries, your second point is spot on.

Let us know when you do, happy to let others know :)
@_date: 2014-02-18 21:10:52
Apps are the the solution for retail, touch devices are not robust enough for a lot of cases, don't have a printer and cannot be easily shared with staff.

Another alternative is [Coinkite's Bitcoin API]( and the free/open [Obelisk server](
Unlike Coinbase and Bitpay, Coinkite doesn't exchange to fiat so No KYC/AML and more privacy.
[Then all the other functions]( like BIP32 HD wallets, etc... 
@_date: 2014-11-18 19:53:40
I don't know the particulars of Copay, but a lot of the prominent wallets don't offer key generation offline and we think thats bad.
@_date: 2014-07-18 20:40:44
No, if you have a paid plan transactions are free.
@_date: 2014-04-08 15:14:30
The private keys would never go through a websession. Also, they never leave the HSMs 
@_date: 2014-03-13 16:51:55
In order to send bitcoins by email you need server side capabilities, so no way around creating an account.

I'm not defending his rate, but I think the issue here is cost recovery. Running a B&amp;M business simply has more costs, so the fees may need to be higher.
@_date: 2014-08-03 21:16:14
Coinkite will offer this soon.
@_date: 2014-04-08 14:53:21
Funds on Coinkite are held in allocated private keys with full liquidity, yes some level of trust is required in order to have some convenience. But this system is very different than just holding all the coins in one large pool. Please read 
@_date: 2014-11-25 21:34:35
This looks fantastic! 
@_date: 2014-04-21 18:25:01
Yes you could use your phone, but there are many advantages to this.
1. Printer: Many location you are mandated by law to provide paper receipts.
2. Training staff and access to your phone. 
3. This has Global GSM and is a single purpose device, can't be stolen for anything else.
4. Lot's of business logic on the back
    - fine tuning buy/sell markup
    - prints paper wallets
    - prints vouchers
    - handles multiple currencies
    - QR scanner
    - Reads Coinkite cards with Zero Confimations
    - etc...
5. It's strong and robust, wont break when it fall for the 10th time on the floor.
The list goes on, check out 
@_date: 2014-12-16 18:36:37
Just choose 2-of-3 and select "Simple" or "HSM+Password" for each, it shouldn't take more than 1 min.

Coinkite is not locking you in, you can create all keys offline, and take them else where if you like. PS: Coinb.in is a fine project, looking forward to their HD support, then you will be able to use it with Coinkite too.

We are a crypto only company, so we decided to deal with EMV and all the bag of hurt that is. The cards only work on our terminals and have a QR code on the back to receive. They are a great way to gift bitcoin to someone of if there are lots of locations with our terminals in your city. 
@_date: 2014-11-07 20:03:33
It is the first time I agree with you. Would be very hard to secure that brand (domains, etc...)
@_date: 2014-08-05 13:42:44
Not necessarily; the cards allow you to receive money with no electronic device and also allow you to [authenticate with no need for a phone]( It's not a winner takes all case, there is room for multiple solutions. Coinkite itself [doesn't require you to use the cards.](
@_date: 2014-12-12 05:54:39
Happy to, but they need to support the same depth of HD multsig and signing. 
You can already generate your own private keys offline and upload only the xpubkey with this tool  or anything similar
On a similar note, the guys from Ledger already started a prototype  @_date: 2014-06-04 12:48:38
The easy and obvious workaround is using a web wallet
(servers handling the transactions, Coinkite.com, Blockchain.info, etc...) 
your identity wont be exposed.
PS: yes, they could find out which web wallet, but not who you are.

2. We are adding a feature in a couple weeks to auto forward funds to any Bitcoin Address, including BitPay.
3. We already have 2FA on the website, and have plans for it on the terminal.

You actually need to give printed receipts in most situations, there is tip issue, then you have to give your smartphone to you staff if you walk out, then you need to also train them.

You are correct, but **we offer a backup download of raw data (includes all extended public keys).**

- yes, also, the guys from and ledger already have a command line tool and are working on a GUI.
- each Multisig account is its own wallet, you can generate new receiving addresses.
- yes, but not selling your information to advertisers and providing real privacy has a price. You can create more than one user ;)
- yeah, it's a pretty cool feature, it also works as payment urls!!

1. We purposely don't handle the Fiat, we have the logic in place to do the Buy/Sell, but you have to have a cash register, a EMV debit machine of your choice, or a setup like a MoneyMart. We also have a auto funds forward feature coming, so that you can send to any exchange.
2. We will make an announcement soon about Alts Roadmap and Requirements

I'm trying to put together a list of other wallets that also offer a direct onion address. 
People should only use address where I can see I signed onion address on the official non obscured page. But at the end of the days it's their choice.

For web wallets Coinkite is only one using HSMs.
@_date: 2015-05-11 03:52:03
You can have multisig with only you owning the keys. Meaning you don't need anyone to co-sign. 
@_date: 2014-08-06 21:07:04
If you use our onion address the connection is encrypted between you and coinkite.

Would love to see an open source page for people to sell files. After you pay with Bitcoin you get an encryption key to open the file.
Check out [**Coinkite's API**]( it can make it a lot easier to acomplish that, there are even some open source examples you can run on google AppEngine to bootstrap.
@_date: 2014-02-19 15:38:22
That's not correct, please check the pricing page, we made it more clear.
@_date: 2015-05-26 13:43:35
That's **not true**, you can use Coinkite free with multisig, no deposit limit. 
Yes, people can upgrade and help support a company that offers a good product, good support, no ADs, real privacy, some of the best security (over 2 years in business with no incidents, at all), more features than anyone, SMS, Payment Pages, Vouchers, Terminals, up to m-of-15, ledger integration, offline key generation, Bitcoin HSMs, quality API, onion access, contribute back to OpenSource, etc... Crazy huh!
@_date: 2015-05-15 02:01:53
I think you already know, start accepting and suggest integrating in client's websites :)

No, then the bad guy would still have half of the possible codes, with this approach, there never full codes in either half. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 19:25:38
You are correct.
However, the storing keys on cards is not secure.
The POSes can accept payment from any other wallet, I don't see an issue. 
And you can use Coinkite's web wallet with any other competitor's POS

Hello, I'm from Coinkite, I wont get into the merits of the post above. I do however feel compelled to explain how our security is next level.

Only if the user is propagating the transaction himself, using [tor for web wallets]( does not expose you to this attack.

You can do both with Coinkite, have the keys offline and/or have it hold the keys for you for remote signing.

You can do something like that with the [Coinkite API]( or use this [other Open Source]( project to generate new payment addresses with live quotes.
@_date: 2015-05-19 18:21:38
Yes, we are using a very high quality provider (better API). The cost effective way is to use the cheaper guys and multiple of them, each for a specific region where they are better.
@_date: 2015-05-28 19:16:18
You are right, I just zoomed in, it seems the terminal operator didn't place the pin on the correct address.

You can do that with [coinkite]( Either by using it as a wallet or just watching wallet addresses.
@_date: 2014-12-08 14:30:49
We wouldn't have access to the funds, since we don't have the private key.

Many have moved their hot wallets to Coinkite Trustless Multisig HSMs, including companies like Conapult. Coinkite have been providing bitcoin security to 1K+ startups for over 2 years with no incidents, hence the lack of coverage.

Coinkite is not a Bitpay competitor, is a Web Wallet, Debit Cards and Point of Sale provider. It does not convert Fiat, for that is can auto forward to an exchange like Bitpay, Coinbase, Bitstamp, etc...

It takes around 5 sec for a QR receipt and 15-20 sec for the card. We still haven't optimized, It will substantially drop soon.

I know, alot of them send them to Coinkite Wallets.
@_date: 2014-12-16 22:27:45
We want to encourage people to use multisig and learn to control their coins. There is no regulation to comply in canada at the moment in regards to holding Bitcoins. The hot wallet is based on private keys, generated in the HSM and assigned to each user, all transactions are blockchain transactions. Not a IOU system like some sites.

We are looking into it. I think it might be unconfirmed "change" and the fact that is small. 
In regards to 2FA, as soon as the user deposits over 1BTC we send an email with a reminder and links to all the extra security options. I do take your point, I will look into making it more obvious.

- Option for multi-user multisig
- Send bitcoin to SMS/Email/Link-Voucher
- Tor with Onion address
- Auto bitcoin forwarding and splitting
- Private key import/sweep
- Notifications

Hi Guys, this is a hackathon demo of [Coinkite's API]( [please report any bugs]( it's still new.
- Blog post about it 
Note: It behaves just like a pay phone, so deposits can only be used on the same number, for a new one, new payment is needed. We plan on making this open source.
**Now have fun, call your loved ones almost anywhere in the world, with Bitcoin with no account needed!!**
- UPDATE 1: Will be back in a few seconds, stupid Google App Engine quota reached. :/
- UPDATE 2: Back now, report any issues.
- UPDATE 3: More data in, calls are cheaper now. This is still a very expensive provider to make this cheap calls. It could be changed later when we FOSS it to multiple local telcos.

Which competitor do you work for? 
- What is misleading about the privacy policy? It's extremely clear: 
- Multisig is not default because beginners deposit only a few mBits and we don't want to confuse with more. When a user deposits more they get an email reminding them about all the better security options.
- Javascript is the way it is to handle phishing attempts.

Hi (cc we support mutliple setups of multisig. You can definetly setup wallets on our system that require no third party trust, including us.
from 1-of-1 up to M-of-15, keys can be any/all generated outside our system or even be Ledgers
- Read more here 
- API here  (supports tor too)
With the co-sign API you should be able to do all you need for this project without having to trust us. If you want to get fancier you can even do escrow.
Stepping out, but If you have more questions ping us on support easier to do back and forth that way. 
@_date: 2015-05-20 22:55:39
Not yet (that I know of), we (Coinkite) have been talking to a few other players to see if we can make it happen. For now we offer a [co-sign API.]( That's what Coinapult is using now.
@_date: 2015-05-19 15:31:47
Yes, not cost optimized. The provider doesn't have a good pre-call quote, and calls to the same country can vary in order of magnitude. For now this is for fun, like a bitcoin payphone. We will open source it, you will be able to for and tweak prices.
Just a note, you just made a call to a different country, from the browser with no user registration paying with Bitcoin. Still pretty cool in my books :P
@_date: 2014-02-13 18:26:42
Not at this point, maybe in the future.
@_date: 2014-12-06 05:05:36
What pr? It as never sent out to the press.
We have being swamped and haven't had a chance to organize one.
Have you though about just building something with our API?
Let's me know,
@_date: 2014-01-21 16:26:58
Maybe I post a lot about Coinkite because I'm one of the Founders :)
 
@_date: 2015-05-20 23:26:20
They really have to comply or they go to jail, laws around MSBs are not a joke. 
But there are [alternatives!]( We chose not to deal with fiat to avoid becoming an MSB. 
Over [1.5K devs using our API and growing.](
@_date: 2015-05-02 13:09:27
Not if you use the Co-Sign stuff, then you can generate the keys offline, up to m-of-15. You can even use a Ledger Nano as key holder.
@_date: 2014-11-15 05:20:00
That's only for price, there is the other 99%. Wallet API, Blockchain transaction searches, etc...
@_date: 2015-05-10 13:41:57
Since you decided to post all this issues, I think the least you can do is discuss them and disclose the competition or conflict of interest. You didn't address any of my other responses either. This to me just seems like an empty attack. 
@_date: 2015-05-04 18:04:29
Coinapult uses [Coinkite API and Multsig Plafoform]( to secure funds now.
@_date: 2015-05-11 17:46:12
This is essentially mesh-net
@_date: 2014-12-11 04:35:33
There are other options that offer wallet services over tor.
@_date: 2014-08-06 17:36:07
You use Coinkite over Tor to send the sms.
@_date: 2014-12-24 17:05:57
Thanks for the vote of confidence. Our mission has always been to create the services that we would like to use ourselves. Unfortunately, I cannot discuss legal opinions here – I hope someone else answers this for you.
@_date: 2014-05-09 21:45:18
We are shipping since November, number of locations growing. 
@_date: 2015-05-29 16:23:24
For only $0.60 you can make an international call without a phone just using the browser!
The number is in California, Dorian's area code :P. You are in Canada right? So it's an international call. Also, if you went to pay-phone you'd pay much more than that. Unfortunately, this can't be a "budget" service due to telcos, but it's very useful for other purposes, like when you don't use your phone.
@_date: 2015-05-19 15:47:24
You don't need to use it. We are open sourcing it, you could make the calls free if you like.
@_date: 2014-08-06 15:07:32
You should have it by now
@_date: 2014-11-19 01:34:33
Some are very large transactions (Bytes), we are still working on making the fees better. You can actually see those fees are not coming to us.
@_date: 2014-01-08 22:38:18
You dont need to have the card to use Coinkite. That's just a plus.
@_date: 2014-11-07 22:57:24
I don't think you understand how Coinkite works and the necessity of some services needing access to private keys for high availability background processes. 
On the other hand I understand and also favor decentralized services, hence our announcement coming this month. 
Stay tunned :)
@_date: 2015-05-02 00:08:33
You should use Multisig 
@_date: 2015-05-10 16:32:29
If you are certain you can generate and encrypt keys safely, that would be acceptable. The issue is, you won't know if you made a mistake. You could use [this offline generating tool]( uses OpenSSL to prove the keys were encrypted the way it's claimed. You can choose to upload the keys. Disclosure, I work there. Happy to answer any questions.
@_date: 2015-05-19 16:35:44
Please be careful, the IP and destination phone number are not Anon.  Maybe someone could fork it and use other telco providers.
@_date: 2014-09-17 02:28:24
Needs a more polished UI :)

We now know it is. Amazing thing is, there is clear interest as its going up again. 
@_date: 2014-09-17 02:59:42
And here 
@_date: 2015-05-10 16:19:18
- Don't upload the file to those cloud services, if you missed something your wallet could be compromised.
- Don't use phones for real amounts of bitcoin. If you want to go that route, but a cheap pc.
- Avoid single points of failure, like single keys.
- I keep mine in Multisig with part [offline generated keys](
- Would be a lot safer to use [Multisig with Hardware wallets](
- What ever you do, use tiny amounts to test sending out a few times before you put in the total.
@_date: 2015-05-14 04:04:44
I have something similar for one of my wallets, some guys I know are doing 3 of 10 for their 10 employees. It's not exactly what the OP wants but it's close. You can do 4 of 5 or up m of 15 on Coinkite, you can also generate any/all offline or Ledgers and only share the xpub. [Here is more in depth write up of this implementation](
@_date: 2015-05-14 20:19:04
At least in Canada (prob the same in the US) there is only a Profit/Loss at realization. That means, if the coins are still sitting in your wallet (one that you legally own, regardless if there is another custodian), the loss/profit doesn't count. It's only realized at the time it changes hands or is exchanged for another currency, including crypto. See accounting help, they always save you money.
@_date: 2015-05-14 22:59:33
I think the realization event was when you took ownership, what ever it was worth at that time.
@_date: 2015-05-19 16:04:20
More data in, price a tad lower now.
@_date: 2015-05-27 15:05:34
You could just export and [re-import/sweep the private key]( into another [multisig wallet](
@_date: 2014-12-28 17:24:18
Yes, you have the option to own the private keys without ever sharing them.

Good stuff!

It's ludicrous that I need to share my personal information for small donations not even been in the US or American.

Check out [this alternative]( amazing uptime.
@_date: 2015-05-15 19:01:49
Nice to hear, we had to restart one of our web servers last night for an update, was painful to restart the clock after 242 days uptime.
@_date: 2015-05-19 16:33:24
It can be done much cheaper if you spend the time adding a different telco supplier per region. FOSSing it soon.
@_date: 2015-05-11 04:59:11
The other key can be a hardware wallet (ie Ledger) or even a different App. Nothing is perfect, but having more than one point of failure only makes it better.
@_date: 2015-05-19 18:17:28
Thanks! 
@_date: 2015-05-23 15:51:44
2 min ago walking down the street on Kensington market in Toronto, a guy saw my t-shirt and said "hey, nice t-shirt, I have some bitcoins too. How much are they now? What happened to mtgox"

Coinkite Multisig
@_date: 2015-05-22 11:49:35
Yup, It is the only sane way to manage funds with high availability. I sent them an email about using [our HSMs with multisig]( for those hot wallets...
@_date: 2015-05-17 22:47:18
Ok, but someone needs to track the addresses and UTXOs.
@_date: 2014-09-18 20:24:36
Different logic; a lot of large merchants use Coinkite then automatically forward the the percentage they want to convert to exchanges and auto sell there.
@_date: 2014-01-11 17:09:09
Coinkite is based of Toronto!
@_date: 2014-12-07 20:11:26
We've missed that on the last changes, it is confusing. The story is, for hot wallets no private keys export, for **multisig you can upload your own xpubkey.** both are BIP32 HD. 
So if you want control, but keep it simple, create a 1-of-1 and you are set. 
here are some of the options:

@_date: 2015-05-22 14:47:56
It's an optional tool, off by default. It's all in the terms of service, the burden is on the caller to inform the other party not in the service provider. The user could record with a mic recorder too, even if we don't offer the Mp3 button. We also give them a voice reminder to inform the other party before the call is connected.
@_date: 2015-05-15 17:08:01
We offer very different services than BitPay, we are not in the business of fiat conversion (we actually refer customers to them for that) and we do much more than checkouts (although we [have an FOSS version](
Besides privacy, uptime and amazing support, we offer a ton of unique features: Co-Sign Multisig API with up to m-of-15, option for any/all keys to be generated Offline, HSM, HSM+Password, Invite other users, etc.... Punub push notifications, webhooks. Send coins to SMS/Email/PickupLink, Multiple wallets under the same user with different rules. Fine grained API security features. Great web UI for funds management.

Yes, any amount. That's just to help you get organized or share a link with a pre filled amt.
Not at this time, we plan on adding more display options, but because most of our users hold a lot, they prefer that display.
I think so. Just take a look at the notifications page

It will have to get tested through the courts, but my personal opinion is that only will apply to IOU wallets and exchanges.

That sucks. I know wont help now but next time try the Coinkite [private key sweep/import]( then put it in [multisig](

Did you contact support?? support @ coinkite dot com
Coinkite has a no questions ask refund policy for this kind of stuff, If you contact support you get a refund.
Why the need to throw away account, what kind of reaction do you expect for something like this? 
Sound like you are trying to smear.
**Coinkite offers 100% FREE Multi-Signature account** and have no limits for deposits in that account type. You can just create it and move the balance there. All this info is clear under Pricing.
1. To get a new address you just go to "Receive", the 2nd option. And its all there.
2. I don't understand why you need to set a change address, thats not something we offer.
3. You can't setup miner's fee the system calculates automatically so transactions don't get stuck.
@_date: 2015-05-26 14:15:51
I'm a fan myself of many of those. And yes, some of those things can be done using them, most of them don't offer multiple features we do. [Many people see value in what we offer]( free market is a beautiful thing. 
@_date: 2015-05-08 15:40:20
Not true about Coinkite, we have incredible [privacy policies]( and our [monetization]( is based on honest and old-school business models; charge money for premium features.
@_date: 2015-05-08 16:53:05
It's definitely on the list!

You are right, I just finished watching the video.
@_date: 2014-12-17 05:09:59

Don't claim something that is not true or I will call you out on it.

It's open source, fork it and just use a different company's [API]( or run your own Obelisk. Some coding will be required.

Congrats guys.
@_date: 2014-12-24 17:33:28
We are not in that business for that reason – exchanges should not be wallets and vice-versa. Buy bitcoin face-to-face P2P and you don't need a service.

I'd love to one day get there, the main problem is that most merchants simply don't care about the tech, they care about simplicity and their bottom line.
@_date: 2015-05-27 21:11:57
There is no need for payment processing if they don't need conversion. It's nice to have a wallet/API to handle new payment addresses with high availability, multisig, or a [payment page]( but It's bitcoin, you can do it all yourself.

@_date: 2015-05-28 19:59:19
You can send it to multisig addresses. But yes, there is no magic, if you want fully trustless you need to run your own server/code, needs high availability to watch and split the transactions, you could use [BitKit API]( to do that too. 
Coinkite has been in business for over 2yr with no incidents. Also, transactions coming in will be automatically split and forwarded, that means the trust only happens momentarily and per transaction, they can then go to a [internal or external multsig address]( that coinkite controls the minority or none of the keys. 
@_date: 2015-05-19 22:14:41
Unfortunately no easy answer as some wallets (the IOU types) may not broadcast the transaction for a few minutes. That could cause the user to not top-up in time.

Besides not knowing what they do to your info, none, this was a proof of concept project. 
@_date: 2015-05-06 17:03:44
- there was a lot of discussed here  
- and we wrote a blog post: 
I will let the folks from Ledger (talk about their wallet. 
With Coinkite+Ledger you can do [Multi-signature]( exponentially increasing security. Another interesting aspect is that you can use multiple ledger for the same wallet, have multiple users sharing the same wallet and use a mix of key sources, up to m-of-15.
You also get to take advantage of sending money via SMS/Email/Link-Pickup, Payment Pages, Notifications, Tor and everything else Coinkite offers.
From the post, some of the Advantages:
- Hold the co-signing key in a dedicated Ledger Nano device.
- Private key never leaves the hardware wallet.
- Mix with other keys stored on Coinkite ("Co-signed by Coinkite") and/or offline (ie. 'cold').
- SMS, Email and on-line notifications of each transaction, at each step of the way.
- Privacy: Coinkite broadcasts the transactions for you.
- More easily receive Bitcoin: request money via link, email and SMS
- More easily send Bitcoin: you can  send Bitcoin via SMS/Email or Link
- Multi-user, invite a second user to hold the other keys; either in their Ledger or otherwise.
- Have a [bitcoin payment page]( for your Ledger
@_date: 2015-05-01 18:31:31
You can follow the example of Coinfest and use Coinkite multisig wallet then display the transactions on a page.
See here 
@_date: 2014-07-15 18:13:34
Coinkite customers have a long list of features that are not available on Coinbase including **Auditable Account**, **Immediate Transactions** for **any amount**, **Funds Forwarding**, **Privacy**, etc... The customer demographic is more towards large depositors and businesses interested in paying for someone else to handle security and high quality support. It is a very different technical design based on BIP32.

All of our DBs are encrypted by row, our web workers need to be signed by the HSMs. A very tight closed loop.
And many companies have moved their hot wallets to Coinkite Trustless Multisig HSMs, including companies like Conapult. Coinkite have been providing bitcoin security to 1K+ startups for over 2 years with no incidents, hence the lack of coverage.

Sweep that key in a [Multisig Offline wallet]( then split into multiple wallets of different technologies/locations. After you have the BTC well distributed start selling/exchanging for other assets each individual smaller wallet.

~~I think you are miss informed,~~ 
Coinkite is the only Multi-signature wallet that gives you the option to generate any/all keys offline  and also offers a dead man switch for the [standard hotwallet](
@_date: 2015-05-28 17:35:15
Yes, you can use this [Coinkite's automated splitting and forwarding solution]( With that you can split and forward to any number of percentages (as long as it adds up to 100%) and multiple addresses, including to multisig.
@_date: 2016-03-10 23:39:54
Once it's running network wide, yes it should solve the problem. But even if we re-enable it, 0-conf is not Bitcoin, you can never fully trust those inputs, no matter how amazing your ~~snake oil~~ statistical algo.
what's your scenario here? If you are selling digital good, you could still release the item, for physical things they wont ship for a few hrs, for in person things you can just wait or wait judgement, etc... Let me know what you are trying to do, we might have a solution for you.
@_date: 2015-01-06 03:17:55
I'm actually very disappointed at that write up, there is a lot of inaccurate info about coinkite.
@_date: 2015-01-06 05:23:46
Well they said Coinkite doesn't offer co-signing, which is inaccurate. It's actually the only one that offers both co-signing by multiple users and anonymously with the co-sign page. You can read more about it here in this post 
@_date: 2015-01-10 15:48:47

You can do that with Coinkite. Just go to the Receive menu and send a payment request link by email, they will have the QR and URI. Example:

Great post, check out [this open source checkout]( with a timer and option to run in testnet too.
@_date: 2015-05-15 21:48:30
Sorry, still trying to figure out the right language :/
Simple is meant to function as Coinkite to Co-sign, that means it's a key we can access to be a Co-Signer for you, a custodian of that key. Hot wallet is essentially a key generated in the HSM that we have access to, it's mostly used as a fast access account (less overhead than multisig).
If you'd like for us to have no access then use HSM+Password or Offline Key ([our tool]( can encrypt and back it up for you)
- Quick explanation of each key:  
- This is a good read, explains everything: 
@_date: 2015-05-17 21:35:04
You could use [Coinkite's API]( If I'm not wrong you can submit the xpub key as a 1 of 1 Multisig account and use the API to generate and check news addresses. And with this API use this [checkout open source project](

You do get a notification event for incoming broadcasted transactions, those can be used to trigger your "shopping cart". We just don't let you build a new transaction with unconfirmed inputs.

- [Coinkite]( has both online web **wallet with multisig** and an **offline tool to generate private keys** that you can keep secret. 
- Also very important to read about security by yourself, **education** is how you keep your bitcoins away from bad guys.

@_date: 2016-03-10 22:31:10
We disabled it during the large network attacks. This is bad for the network and we don't want to let our users build bad transactions. Once the root of the issue is resolved we will resume the 0-conf feature.

Not sure on the reasons, but yes, you need WebRTC and I think most mobile browsers don't have it.
@_date: 2015-05-27 21:31:53
Those are the advantages, but the beauty of open networks is that you can do it all yourself. If you want to outsource the security, more features, email notifications, etc... use a wallet, if you don't need anything extra, use a simple address.

1. Yes, BTU price would likely go to bottom.
2. You have to have a wallet that understands there are two chains and that per first use of a coin (UTXOs) will initially create two separate transactions. Lots of risk.

Apple sand boxes apps and iOS is closed source.
But at the end of the day, all phones are exposed to some Base Band attacks due to carrier access to that. 
There is no winning. Phones are not secure devices. 
If you are concern about state actors use paper. If you are concern about shitty companies selling your data (and incompetently opening backdoors), I prefer Apple over Google things. If you are concern about hackers use iOS, Android pristine or a BlackPhone

@_date: 2019-11-27 18:20:34
Two different modes means 2 different cases, 2 different PCBs, etc... then we need to maintain two inventories. 
In the future we will look at different screen size, but that’s much further away and we would stick to one model of Coldcard. :)
@_date: 2019-11-15 14:36:29
No, it's a bearer asset. Physical possession is ownership. Neither party knows the private key until it is physically unsealed.
@_date: 2017-03-03 15:56:37
Yes, works just fine with ANY OS. It mimics a FAT file system with no need to install any software!

Trezor 1 has many issues and seems end of life inventory surplus use to be sold at 100+.
Trezor T is 165 USD. Trezor doesn’t have an SE and is physically insecure, on top of the unfixable issues with their MCU.  Ledger has an SE but same story price wise and closed source.
The restock is not due to funding is unexpected higher demand and slow chip supplier. We’ve put an order of chips for the second batch months ago.

It’s in the Coldcard backup menu.
@_date: 2019-11-27 18:58:50
The ones we sell are for backup, here is the description: Industrial Grade MicroSD for secure Coldcard backups. True SLC design w/ wear-leveling &amp; block mgmt. Environmental tested (bend / torque / salt spray / solar radiation) and harsh temperatures: -40°C to +85°C.
Standard cards are not rated for backup and suffer from a high rate of bit rot and other physical degradation issues. But they are fine for PSBT transfers.
@_date: 2016-06-07 21:55:51
No, that would not be safe. The firmware is securely "burned in". 
This is the firmware for the second batch.

We made this graphic of Dorian back when the Newsweek article first came out and made bunch of stickers back then.  We had not really given it much thought since, and just thought it was a generic/meme/image these days.
However, you are right that we shouldn't be using his image to promote our products, and creating any confusion about an endorsement or similar.
We have removed his [image from the Sticker Mule site]( and all web sites we control. We will stop including the stickers in new Opendime shipments.
We will reach out to Dorian to set this right.
Thanks to the community for brining this to our attention

Sure, but who prints the private key on the bill?
@_date: 2017-08-22 14:54:37
It's just like cash/gold, you trade online ease for in person off-chain privacy and speed. Bitcoin needs many different solutions for different people. For example, off-chain transactions give bitcoin unlimited scalability, 
@_date: 2016-11-02 19:54:05
 Finally! 
@_date: 2017-08-26 12:47:57
Sauce != source. Assuming you meant the later. 
Open money. Bitcoin is used as the underlining store of value. It's open to anyone to use, no censorship. No central authority, once you have the Opendime we don't control the wallet, only you do. And so on.
@_date: 2017-08-16 17:38:54
Exactly! the transaction is already made, one way data for balance checking is all you need!
@_date: 2016-12-12 16:51:09
There is a lot in between significant amount and insignificant amount. It's not single use, it's multi off-chain spend and single on-chain spend. Among other reasons like easy of use, app-less, etc... You can amortize the cost in multiple physical exchanges. And/or justify the premium on privacy and convenience. It's like using a *flash drive* with money that can't be robbed by a dirty computer. 
Some things you just need to try for yourself. The plug-and-play UX is incredible. Thousands of years in inherent natural feel of physically giving something to another human is just there.
@_date: 2016-11-02 17:22:48
There is a bug on unit configuration. I can't change from bits to full Bitcoin.

Eventually yes, quality components specialized in security are expensive. If the bitcoin economy/community get another order of magnitude bigger we can take advantage of other consumer electronics economies of scale :)

@_date: 2016-12-13 01:59:58
Ledger has a great UI and uses a secure micro.
@_date: 2016-12-12 17:51:53
I take your point (I read the thread in original form). It is OD's early days, with more efficiencies from economies of scale it maybe more viable to have a small display. It all comes down to cost, somewhere it's gotta give. 
V1 sold out, we took the feedback (including more languages) and made V1.1 in a much bigger production run, which we now have fumes, almost sold out. 
We feel that with v2 (coming) we will have good balance of features vs/cost to sell a even bigger production run. V3 will probably go a step further. The key is to keep iterating to test the market. It's all new, there is nothing like this in the market to find reference points.
What truly fascinates me is all the use cases I have no idea. We really measure on repeat buys which are often 3-4x qty of the users first purchase.

@_date: 2016-12-12 17:59:49
I think you were taking his v1 literally when it was a subjective assertion. To me his point is, this concept *essence* is there and we shouldn't feature creep it–which I agree. But that doesn't mean we can't improve it. 
As a side note, cost effective displays are not secure, could be cheated/replaced. Each new feature can introduce an new attack vector that would have to be worked out. 
@_date: 2017-01-04 18:44:51

There is no such thing is 100% FOSS hardware. The firmware of this device is 100% Open Source. 100% of the parts are available for you to buy, build yourself and validate it if you want. None of the closed source hardware crypto Accelerators are used for Bitcoin operations. You can also add your own entropy with the dice feature. Might be worth listening to the [Livera podcast Coldcard episode.](

@_date: 2019-08-29 15:47:32
Creating a backdoor for resetting the hardware opens you up for more attack vectors. With this simpler approach you only have one way in and out. If don't have the key, the secret is safe. You can use the seed backup to restore in new hardware. But that device is lockdown.
@_date: 2019-08-25 02:44:25

TVS diode array (ESD protection) 
@_date: 2016-12-23 15:20:46
Opendime isn't flash memory and does have some ESD protection. It's always good to be skeptical, though. 
@_date: 2019-08-30 16:00:55
Yes. You can use the seed backup. Some ppl prefer to have that very hard to access and a few encrypted backups a bit more available in SDs.
@_date: 2019-08-29 17:07:02
Yes. Or MicroSD
@_date: 2019-10-11 12:45:04
We just did a big round of that for Mk2 with the new Mk3 Firmware, they share it. But yes, support for older versions will slowly deteriorate. Because its so early in this technology, it's important to prioritize security improvements with newer models than the small loss of a cheap device. Also, this is about your life savings, most ppl spend much more than this a year in bank fees.
@_date: 2019-08-30 10:55:49
Yes, any card smaller than 32GB. Just don’t advise using normal cards for backup.
@_date: 2016-12-12 15:50:26
I'm very fortunate to make a living doing something I love, working in a ton of products and coming to bitcoin in the early days. 
I can't even imagine the frustration you have in your life to waist so much time coming here to just troll. It must suck to be you. But it gets better buddy, first step is to stop being a dick. Then put pants on, and brave the world :)

As a everyday actual wallet, I recommend Ledger.
@_date: 2016-12-12 15:25:53
People thought no one would ever be able to have one of these in their pockets, let alone have access to all human knowledge.
But as Beautyon_ put it, you are right. Computers are too heavy, they will never catch on.

KISS: create a copay multisig wallet, export a backup with very strong password. Print and also put on SD card and store somewhere safe.
If you want are to be more secure/complex, look into split key storage. 
@_date: 2016-12-12 14:58:42
If you are putting it at the bank, make sure the seeds are encrypted.

@_date: 2016-12-09 22:38:49
There is no "seal" per say. When the micro is connected to power the first time with the trace broken it changes it's internal state permanently. So even if you re-solder the trace you can't change the micro.
@_date: 2019-08-29 15:39:01
No, that's the idea.
@_date: 2016-12-27 17:18:10
Was not designed as such, but you could use it as a secure priv-key generator, specially if you break the seal and make a paper backup. 
@_date: 2019-08-29 22:50:36
And yet, offer physical security where Trezor doesn’t. And is open source.

@_date: 2019-10-17 17:55:04
I don't think you understand hardware. 
Again, what is your attack idea? What are you trying to accomplish? This is just straw-man. When a device uses publicly available parts and is this simple, there is nothing to "hide". An attacker would go after the MCU and/or SE and the bus, there is nothing else to attack.
@_date: 2019-08-30 10:57:02
Not that simple. You can probably demonstrate it’s doing what you want. Ie using the Dice roll feature to generate your seed.
@_date: 2019-10-21 17:57:49
Yes. Keep it simple :)
@_date: 2019-10-17 16:41:32
There are only two parts that mater, the MCU (STM32L496RGT6) and the SE (ATECC608A). 
Both are described here in the white paper ( 
The PCB passives have no consequence and you can just take the board and measure their values yourself. 
This means the parts are listed publicly. I don't understand what your goal is.
Regardless, all parts Coldcard use are available from any parts supplier to anyone.

Just a note on the NFC, which we have prototyped too. Only one-way can be done w/o companion app and can be cost effective. One way means unverifiable, and easily forged w/ 5 cent sticker.

The case is sand blasted, so its not perfectly clear. Looks kinda blurry on pictures. here is a close up

Electrum is a super complex beast, supports a ton of formats and is actually used by many other wallets as the recovery tool.

that's is an indication of where the secure element is. If you want to dispose it, it's ideal to destroy the device. More info here

That’s a good start. I plan on adding Electrum info soon. Just need to find the time to document it.
@_date: 2019-08-29 15:49:03
Yes, PSBTs could become multi megabyte for more complex transactions. So QRs in smaller screen are a no go. QRs are still good for deposit addresses, specially with bech32!
@_date: 2019-10-16 13:29:27
Start to ship pre-orders next week, in order of purchase.
@_date: 2019-10-15 19:52:57
1. We will never build a web interface, that's insanely bad.
2. You can use the device air gapped with MicroSDs to transport PSBT files from Electrum, Wasabi, BlueWallet and Bitcoin Core HWI (soon UI)
3. Alternatively you can use Coldcard via USB with Electrum, Wasabi, BlueWallet and Bitcoin Core HWI (soon UI) like you would with any of the other common HWs.
Ping support in regards to review units :)
@_date: 2019-08-30 21:16:40
Yes. It’s Air Gapped. Hard to beat that. USB stack is a mess.
@_date: 2019-10-15 23:00:25
Thanks for the interest, but no.
@_date: 2019-10-17 14:11:17
Thanks. Back log should be resolved by end of next week, maybe the one after. But, orders are picking up and you may be pushed again.
@_date: 2019-10-17 21:57:20
We will share the schematic soon.

Not a big concern as the keypad was designed form a lot of pressing. But, keypad scrambling feature is on the road map.

All the info needed for attackers (which we do interact with alot) is available on there. Every attacker we have interacted so far were satisfied with this information for them to keep pen testing. 
I take no issue with someone asking, but fresh not liking the answer doesn't make it wrong.

Sorry :/
It was just the tweet text.

You are free to have your opinion, Bitcoin is a voluntary system. People can develop their wallets however they want. The reason why I made this site is because they are not documenting their recovery process.

I wouldn’t use a Trezor either, it’s just a MCU. Hence the attacks every other year. Like the ROM dump.
I must note I’m one of the guys behind Coldcard, bias opinion I guess.
@_date: 2019-02-23 17:37:38
So right now is just a plain MCU?
@_date: 2015-08-12 13:31:01
You should definitely try Coinkite's [multisig wallet]( specially with the [offline tool]( up to m-of-15 and any/all keys can be generated offline. Then you get a whole bunch more features, notifications, forwarding, pay buttons, auditing, etc...
@_date: 2015-08-24 01:54:30
There are alternatives, [here is one](

@_date: 2015-08-05 16:54:09
True, Coinkite is good, can be run trustless with [keys generated offline and transactions signed offline]( and so is Electrum. I could be biased, but I think Coinkite stands on it's own and like many who participate here, I don't see the point of stating my affiliation on every post. And, I added a good alternative.
@_date: 2015-08-12 13:22:54
[Coinkite]( has good support and uptime, multi-signature, up to m-of-15, any/all keys can be generated offline, and lots and lots of features!
You should also try Electrum for desktop, and Schilbacs Bitcoin wallet for Android.
@_date: 2015-08-26 18:43:54
A few other places would be, reaching out to a dev shop like [Coinfabrik]( or going to some [meet-ups](

Not if the user doesn't want. **They can just use [multisig]( where they can own all keys and Coinkite doesn't hold their funds** :)
The button/checkout will just generate a new payment address from that.

It's a page with tor address signed. 
@_date: 2019-10-17 16:42:36
Probably different derivation. Wasabi uses very deep derivation specs for mixing and IIRC Electrum default is only 100 addresses.
@_date: 2015-08-08 12:53:33
Use [multidig]( for long term storage

Sorry, that’s not secure. You are trying to plug something not designed to hold real secrets. But I think that your plan is this to be a small amounts only on the go wallet, so I guess it’s ok for that.
@_date: 2015-08-28 15:19:00
No, you can just buy and send straight to an exchange that can deposit pesos in her bank account. If you want to hold some bitcoin than yes, keep them in a multisig wallet. Coinkite is great, but i'm bias I work there :)

There are lot's of Bitcoin startups building amazing new things. 
Just off the top of my mind:
- Purse (discounted amazon)
- Bitcoindial (anon phonecalls)
- Stremium (streaming service)
- Changetip (tipping online)
- Coinkite [Me] (bitcoin platform with multsig, merchant services and no ID requirements)
- Augur (prediction market)
- OneName (blockchain Identity)
- Lawnmower (helping you save a little)
- etc...
@_date: 2015-08-11 19:26:11
There is no major re-design required, all you need is to add an extra button/option "Pay with Bitcoin" and that link would send the user to pay on Coinkite's payment page. You shopping cart just needs to add the amount required to the url. Which shopping cart are you using?
@_date: 2015-08-12 17:26:48
Credit cards are a different product, they offer credit (buy without having money) that's not what bitcoin offers.
@_date: 2015-08-05 17:35:59

Any combination of:
- Ledgers
- [Coinkite Offline Tool Kit](
- HSM backed up (key escrow)
- Coinkite Co-Signer
- Coinkite User
- Anon User
- Etc...
We don't put any restrictions as long as the other key parties can talk the same spec. 
[This is worth the read](
@_date: 2015-07-02 12:30:09
Yes, [multisig done right]( Up to m-of-15, any/all keys can be generated offline, keys can be a Ledger, notifications, and lots more!

They need a [donation button]( instead of a single address.

The bootloader runs from the internal flash of the micro. It's locked down and has control over the boot process and keeps the first 32k of flash secret. 508 is fast. it's the bootrom that prevents quick access. we call it a bootrom but it's internal to micro, first 32k.
if you break the bootrom (not easy) then yes, you can brute-force the 508, but with 8-digit or more pins (which we recommend) would take months
main micro has an internal firewall, which is a bus snoop, and that protects bootrom area
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:43:11
Instant anon transactions.

0,

You can do that with Coinkite's [Pay Button and Checkout]( and the return URL, to customize price you can use JTW Tokens. You can then forward the payments to different bitcoin addresses via API. Another solution is this [Open Source checkout]( you could customize to fit your needs.
@_date: 2015-07-06 22:47:08
You don't need an email to create a Coinkite account it's optional :) 
It's probably in your spam folder, or blocked by yahoo backed ISP provided emails.
@_date: 2015-07-28 01:15:25
Coinkite would not know who the user is, you don't need to share any information. 
@_date: 2015-07-15 21:27:42

You should try, Coinkite has a lot of features;
- Mutlsig HD (good read [here]( 
- [up to m of 15]( 
- [any/all keys can be generated offline.](
- [sign transactions offline](
- [private key backup/escrow (encrypted pre-upload, provable with OpenSSL)](
- [Multisig Co-sign pages]( where parties don't have to have a Coinkite account, Anon.
- Multi-user multisig (invite by email or let them post add their xpub anonymously)
- options for Coinkite to co-sign, where it generates a custodian HSM key just for your wallet. 
- [compatible with Ledger Wallet](
- [Private keys sweep/import](
- [Watch only wallets](
- [Bitcoin Splitting and Forwarding](
- Notifications for everything (SMS/eMail/Push)

This thing looks great!
Curious, does it support Coinkite multisig in ledger style or some other way to co-sign transactions?
@_date: 2015-08-07 12:42:05
No verification required on Coinkite.
@_date: 2015-07-27 20:54:13
Use a [BIP32 HD address for your donation button]( much better privacy.
@_date: 2015-07-21 21:26:09
@_date: 2015-08-12 13:06:55
You can just put one of these buttons, takes a minute 
With this one you can generate the keys offline or even use a Ledger.
[Here is a demo of the page that generates the new HD addresses](
You can also [dynamically customize that payment page via JWT tokens](
If you want to get fancy and make your own payment pages then you can just use [this API to request a new HD address](

Not yet because Opendimes are not upgradable and SegWit is new. For that reason the lowest common denominator is preferred.
@_date: 2015-07-22 02:55:06
We didn't build this integration. This is a user's idea, Coinkite's multisig platform is flexible, you can control the keys however you like. About 100,000 bitcoins go through our system every month, and thousands of devs use our API, so I'm not sure where the waste is?

A lot of unintentional straw man on your list.
- You forgot to mention  for the alternatives.
-  
   &gt; The bootloader runs from the internal flash of the micro. It's locked down and has control over the boot process and keeps the first 32k of flash secret. 508 is fast. it's the bootrom that prevents quick access. we call it a bootrom but it's internal to micro, first 32k. if you break the bootrom (not easy) then yes, you can brute-force the 508, but with 8-digit or more pins (which we recommend) would take months main micro has an internal firewall, which is a bus snoop, and that protects bootrom area
- You should check the firmware before having some many strong opinions, It is next level security compared with the competition.

If you are worried about private keys, Coinkite's button works with multsig, so you don't have to trust it. Also it doesn't require any personal information. You could use this other [open source]( (but requires an 3rd party API). 
The issue is, some one needs to write and host the code:)
@_date: 2015-07-23 22:46:57
You could add this [easy pay button]( or customize via [API.](
@_date: 2015-07-21 15:51:44
Yes, it's unpleasant, but we survived. 
When I started using BBSes from Brazil, it would take 20-40min to download an image. This things tend to work themselves out, we as a community will arrive at a consensus at to what the solution has to be. 
IMHO we should be focusing on adoption not be so worried about txn speed. Yes, it's nice when it's fast, but even being slow is a monumental paradigm change, I can send 100K across the pond without permission from my bank.
@_date: 2015-07-16 21:38:03
I think we will need incremental increase, I support even 8, but way down the road. 
As much as block size is todays issue, the biggest thing I want to see is a better consensus mechanisms so that we don't get to an impasse like this again. It will always be messy, but we need to keep moving.
@_date: 2016-02-18 13:23:14

Put simply, imagine that the person paying you received a transaction from someone else. Now imagine the customer wallet is crappy and builds a new transaction to pay you with unconfirmed inputs from the previous transaction. This is not great, but should confirm. Now imagine one or more inputs from the previous transaction get mutated, that would make the second transaction invalid. Some info about malleability here

It's not meant as long term cold storage. 
But the micro is fairly resilient and even if the board is broken. The main micro can be desoldered. And once powered on it will know it's unsealed and will spill out the private key  and the paper here 
@_date: 2019-04-02 14:07:21
Info here 
It's a Bitcoin hardware wallet, so it signs transactions and can be used offline. 
* NO specialized software required. It accepts standard PSBT transaction (BIP 174) stored on an MicroSD card. NO companion 'app' on your computer, works with the major wallets already (Electrum, and more to come).
* It's cheap! Simple packaging, plain design, no fancy boxes, no redundant cables.
* It's ultrasecure! Real crypto security chip. Your private key is stored in a dedicated security chip, not the main micro's flash.
* Easy back-up! MicroSD card slot for backup and data storage. This allows truly offline signing, by transferring the unsigned/signed transactions on sneakernet.
* Open source software design runs Micropython and you can change it.

- In the video the device cover was removed, impossible to tell if the device was not tampered with.
- Without the cover, ESD could have shorten the circuit and unseal the device.
- When unsealed, no money was lost as the key is available for sweeping.
- If the device is not being able to be read by the USB, you can prob it with a scope and the private key would be printed on the serial port. But he wouldn't know that without contacting support. 
- The user didn't contact support for help or information 
If his motivations were really recovering or finding the truth he would first have contacted support and try to sort that out before making public fuss. If his considerations were true, he would have published them after.

You still haven't answered, if is so cheap why don't you send support a pre paid label?
If you made a mistake on the shipping address or missed delivery why others have to bare the burden?
@_date: 2017-09-19 02:53:09
If there is a problem with the address you set to ship, why should others bare the burden when your local post system was not able to deliver? 
UPS would never quote 7 bucks for Canada =&gt; USA, that's just impossible. If that's true, then just arrange with support to use your pre-paid shipping label.
BTW, Thousands have received their Opendimes all over the word and and pretty much every US state without as any issues.

Also, we don't restock or resell returned devices, we are a real security company, we destroy them. There is no financial gain by keeping a returned unit.

We do standard bitcoin HD multisig and you get a backup of everything (keys you generated offline are your responsibility unless they are backup in our system (which you encrypt before uploading)), so ideally any implementation should be able to deal with it. 
But in any case, we offer an implementation ourselves. For that we made a Python script and plan on making a easier to use solution soon.
@_date: 2015-04-21 23:43:43

**Not correct.** We give you a multisig backup bundle when you create the wallet. You can use that to push transactions, also, if you have a key majority you don't even need that.
@_date: 2015-04-14 20:27:25
That's exactly what Coinkite offers, you can get new addresses for each new transaction with the same multisg private keys. We are Multisig HD :)
@_date: 2015-04-02 18:53:20
That's not my suggestion, you cannot spend with xPubs. 
You can however try to derive the privkey.
I suggest you do some more reading before putting money in P2SH manually.

Coinkite is not a bank, no IOUs. [All transactions are on the blockchain, and you can create any/all keys offline!]( We actually offer much more privacy than the others but the OP didn't bother to read further.

*Disclaimer: I work for a multisig wallet, Coinkite. That's where I keep my coins. Regardless who you use, make sure you don't have a single point of failure, as loss can also happen. For large amounts, I suggest a mult-signature setup where the majority quorum of keys is generated offline. [Our info here](

Hi Saffron, 
You are already have a Nym on Coinkite, wonder if you ever setup the [Multisig account]( 
The system is HD (Hierarchical Deterministic). After login, just click on the blue button "Multisig Vault" and that will get you through it. 
Takes just a few seconds to get it done.
If you need other alternatives, checkout Ellectrum, its fully open source and decentralized.

Is the idea of having more than one private key per wallet. For example, you could setup in a way we're you need 2 signatures out of 2 keys, to transfer. Bitcoin supports up to 15 keys per p2sh address (Multisig wallet). We wrote a post about it [here](

It's is pretty cool using more than one on the same wallet, it's exponentially safer. 
Then you can do even fancier things, like another person holding the other one; multi user scenario. Maybe CEO/CFO each have one and other employees use standard Coinkite key. So that an employee can have access to expense account but one of the execs needs to also sign.

**Tl;dr:** You can now use your [Ledger Nano]( with [Coinkite multisig wallets!]( Ledger Nano is a USB hardware wallet, which securely holds your private keys and now can be *easily* used to co-sign proposed shared Coinkite transactions.
- Original [Announcement discussion](
- Original [Announcement post](
- You can use up to 15 keys! 
- That could be in any/all combinations; Ledgers, Coinkite HSM, HSM + Password, Offline generated keys, etc...
- Any of the keys that are external (including ledger) can be added Anonymously via Co-sign Page
- This is a multi-user environment, so each user could have multiple Ledgers signing a shared wallet
- More [info about the multi-sig setup here](
What Advantages Does This Setup Have?
- Hold the co-signing key in a dedicated Ledger Nano device.
- Private key never leaves the hardware wallet.
- Mix with other keys stored on Coinkite ("Co-signed by Coinkite") and/or offline (ie. 'cold').
- SMS, Email and on-line notifications of each transaction, at each step of the way.
- Privacy: Coinkite broadcasts the transactions for you.
- More easily receive Bitcoin: request money via link, email and SMS
- More easily send Bitcoin: you can  send Bitcoin via SMS/Email or Link
- Multi-user, invite a second user to hold the other keys; either in their Ledger or otherwise.
- Have a [bitcoin payment page]( for your Ledger

Thanks for sharing this, some very interesting points. 
In Canada we have Interac or Visa debit, both have fees and are regulated, so bitcoin makes sense. 
In Brazil there is billpay everywhere, If I recall, they now ask for IDs to pay. 
Most countries/regions have very different ways in which payment rails work. The trend to most is extra regulation and more fees. 
But the biggest selling point of Bitcoin in this aspect is being the International Currency, because it can't really be controlled.

It works great on the phone as the site pop ups the camera to read QR codes.
@_date: 2015-04-17 03:39:33
Check out [Coinkite]( Multisig, good support, privacy, easy to use!
Ps: I work there, ask any questions.

Web: Not when you use [multisig and generate the keys offline.](
@_date: 2015-04-27 15:22:00
Can't see why not. You can upload your own extended public keys generated how ever you want. The only challenge, is you will need to use our Co-sign API to sign the parts that are not held by Coinkite. You can now also use Ledger Nanos as keys in our Multisig. 
@_date: 2016-09-14 22:43:37
Nope,

Great job Francis! Gold for you.
@_date: 2015-04-28 12:29:12
We are communication with them, but I if I recall the issue is the Trezor doesn't support Multisig yet.
@_date: 2015-04-07 05:16:47
Coinkite is not like any other Bitcoin web wallet, you can [generate keys offline, have up to 15 keys]( automatically forward funds, use with Tor, have payment pages, good support, API over tor, the list goes on.
@_date: 2015-09-03 21:55:35
- About 50% of all wallets on Coinkite are funded 
- Coinkite is not IOU, so all transactions would have Bitcoin Days Destroyed
- A huge part of Coinkite's volume comes from Bitcoin companies/exchanges/processors using it as their operational wallets, long term storage and API for their applications.

Thanks. Re: subscription, open to ideas. 
@_date: 2015-09-16 17:54:23
Coinkite is not just a wallet, the platform offers a lot of advance and complex features (that scale) to enable other startups to not have to handle bitcoin, things like smart UTXO management, multiple output transactions, custom fees, key escrow, custody, part custody, no custody and cold storage tools for customers to integrate in trustless setup, no AWS (premium servers not in the US), HSMs, and the list goes on. 
Another caveat, many customers from other services (and some competitors) use multiple wallet services to spreading their inventory, but not necessarily publicizing it.
@_date: 2015-04-24 17:37:47
Yes! The Ledger held key doesn't even need to be a Coinkite users. It can be completely anonymous using the Co-sign Page.
@_date: 2015-09-18 14:25:54
Coinkite doesn't have to know anything, real privacy. It is not a financial company, just a technology provider. Because our Wallet system processes the transactions we get to know the numbers, but not much more.
@_date: 2015-09-16 18:50:59

Coinkite follows the Ontario Privacy Act, which is very reasonable. It also does not require any personal information unless there is shipping of any products, then it needs to know your mailing address and share that with the shipping company.

Because we offer a great wallet and checkout on top of the API infrastructure, the use is very much spread between all categories, merchants, business, institutions, startups and the most use goes to our API. A lot of startups and exchanges are using our API to not have to handle Bitcoin anymore. There is a nice breakdown of the platform here

@_date: 2015-04-28 15:01:04
Great, let them know you are interested! I've had a few exchanges, but they need to code part of the integration on their end. Ledger did most of the work on integrating *open extended public key export* and *signing of multisig* standards on *their* chrome extensions. We just made sure Coinkite was talking to it. Our system is incredibly *standard*, all we need is the other system to agree on a sub-key path and sign transactions :)

Most institutional funds are not able to hold the bearer assets, they instead invest on someone else's pile. 
@_date: 2015-09-23 13:24:58
Looks like this on the UI 
- Minium (min): Pay the minimum fee. This is the best choice for most transactions where speed is not a concern.
- 2x/3x/5x Minium: Pay twice / three-times / five-times the minimum fee. This should get your transaction into the blockchain faster. At peak times, we’ve seen 2x be the entry price at times.
- 5/10/50 basis points of the amount: Pay a few basis points (0.05%, 0.1% or 0.5%) of the amount of the transfer. If you’re transferring 100’s of thousands of USD-equivalent amounts, the cost of miner’s fees are probably not important to you. If you choose one of these percent choices, we will still cap the fee at 500x the minimum. So in most cases, because the transaction amount is thousands of times bigger than the fee, all those choices amount to the same “super fast” option (500x). However, for very small transactions, the percentage is still useful for limiting the relative cost of the fee.

The best and easiest way is always to create an account and poke around. We are a Bitcoin wallet, that's easy to use, secure and offers a ton of advanced features. On top of that, we made almost all of our features available to developers via API so they can build their app with our infrastructure :)
From 
This API provides simple and powerful REST integrations for adding bitcoin functions into your business / application.
You can focus on building your app, not infrastructure. With a Multi-Signature, HSM-based vault, we can deliver incredible advantages over other solutions and completely avoid human error in daily operations.
Wallet API
- Multiple "wallets" under the same Coinkite account
- Send and request bitcoin by email, SMS or bitcoin address
- Generate unlimited public keys (HD BIP32)
- Check balances and receive notifications
- Create vouchers and pickup links
- Create paper wallets (with private key published)
- Import and sweep private keys
- Non-technical team members can use the same wallets via web GUI
Multisig Co-Sign API
- Multiple wallets under the same account
- Customize up to m-of-15 key holder combinations
- Generate unlimited public keys (Multisig HD)
- Safely back-up client-side encrypted private keys into Coinkite
- Options! HSM, HSM+Password, Offline Key Generation, Invite other users, etc...
- Create P2SH payment addresses, [withdraw via M-of-N multisig.](
- Coinkite can act as Co-signer
Terminal API
- Terminal location data
- Terminal exchange rate data (personalized)
- Push your own exchange rate
- Control &amp; Monitoring your units
- Manage staff permissions
- Remotely print and reprint receipts
- Create paper wallets (with private key published)
- Custom receipts, banners, QRs, footers, hashes and more

First, its not a "format", it's just bread and butter key signing. We released an open source python version, and is a safer way to make the user prove they own the xpub key they are trying to use.
@_date: 2015-03-31 15:03:24
I feel like you/I are splitting hairs :)
The thing is we made product choices that afford us not requiring to know you, or even your email.
I think your assumption is that this great cartoon is only about exchanging, and I don't see it that way. The issue I have is companies knowing who you are + tracking your bitcoin transactions – and thats how I see in this picture.
It seems we agree about everything we just have a different angle on what is the main focus on this image, which is perfectly ok.
@_date: 2015-10-07 19:52:40

@_date: 2015-10-02 03:16:05
Coinkite's answer to that is, use our **.onion** address  works for the [API too]( Say what ever you want about Tor IP privacy, but if you are using .onion's you have a nice end-to-end encrypted connection. 
BTW, Coinkite doesn't have any servers in the US and you can use Ledger with multisig, their local browser app can be a sanity check for the bitcoin address.
Unfortunately all bitcoin companies are under constant DDOS.

Dust attacks are not new, we've experienced a ton of it specially a few months ago. Your system shouldn't go down because you have some unconfirmed transactions.

HD Wallets allow you to create new bitcoin addresses for each transaction and still keep the same private key. This is great for privacy because people would need all your addresses to know how much do you have. :)

Multisig addresses are P2SH (Pay to Script), it starts with a "3" instead of the "1". You can use block explorers to see the amounts deposit on it, but there are limits to how much information is public. [Read more here](

It's great to see multiple implementations (Coinkite + Bitcore) working together.

@_date: 2015-10-02 05:42:48
Nope. 
First, Coinkite can't run with customer's funds, they hold most of the keys with multisig. 
Second, no customer funds were lost, this is an issue for most users accepting zero confirmation. We thought it be a good idea to put a public warning out to prevent people form losing money.

If people used Localbitcoin, Localtrader, forums, etc... to buy BTC, they can guarantee their privacy much easier. If they do choose  easier exchanges like Coinbase and Circle, then they still can use many anonymizing methods, then move the coins to services that care about their privacy or offline.

@_date: 2015-10-26 17:57:39
Yes, the service still needs to be used to broadcast, but you can have any/all private keys generated yourself, offline and never exposed to the service. Then even use tor to send the offline signed part to Coinkite. You can also download a CSV with all UTXOs, that plus the private keys is all you need to transact without Coinkite at all.  
PS: Another good feature is the ability of encrypting the keys offline and backing them up in escrow.
@_date: 2015-10-06 00:46:47
Here is a good read on multisig and offline keys 
Coinkite does up to 15 keys in any combination, any/all keys can be offline and backup on escrow. Good support, co-sign pages, notification, multiple users with different keys, Coinkite can be a co-signer. And lots of features.
@_date: 2015-02-11 18:54:48
You could SMS him a bitcoin address. 
@_date: 2015-02-09 22:35:12
Would love to see if you guys can make it work with the [Coinkite API]( it can both do live feedback and you can have it in multisig. I'd be happy to feature the code on our blog.
@_date: 2015-03-19 23:18:11
I should also note that you can export a json backup of the xpubs from the bottom of the account details page on the site.

Would love to, but in order to divert development time from other features to this, we need to see more than a hand full of people interested in this specific feature.

No, they can load the HD P2SH keys somewhere else. We believe in choice, offer multiple ways of handling the coins. We show exactly what risks they are exposed to for each option.

Hi, you can use [Coinkite, very powerful wallet API, push notifications and co-sining for multisig.](
@_date: 2015-03-19 21:38:58
For that scenario yes, Coinkite does have a anon [Co-Sign page]( but you can't change P2SHs when they are setup, so yes a new "wallet/P2SH" would need to be setup for each new participants. There are some cool escrow features coming.
@_date: 2015-10-03 05:09:48
@_date: 2015-10-22 18:51:17
You could do that with Coinkite,  and send it to any bitcoin address or to a multisig wallet that you control the keys.
@_date: 2015-02-24 14:03:35
Coinkite is also compatible
@_date: 2015-02-11 03:38:09
They are using discourse.org, nice platform.
@_date: 2015-03-19 21:54:20
I'm not familiar with electrum's multisig setup, if they are doing things in the same specs shouldn't be a problem. But HD Multisig can get hairy, that's why to keep it simple and not have to trust us, we built the [offline tool]( We also built a open source python co-signing program 
@_date: 2015-02-02 02:44:09
1) yes, just use Coinkite [with multi-signature](
2-3) again, not practical issues, this things work themselves out. Protocol will be changed as the need arises. Over simplifying; not concern about 51% attacks, it would plummet bitcoin price before the attackers could sell the coins. 
@_date: 2015-02-18 04:14:01
You can always buy bitcoin in person. That's the beauty of bitcoin, no one has control over it.

Electrum works great, use multisig. 
@_date: 2015-02-01 21:59:28
1. Use a wallet instead of worrying about security (ie. [Coinkite](
2. Non issue, can be scaled up as demand comes.
3. Meh, non (practical) issue. 
@_date: 2015-02-21 04:56:06
Yes. Some thoughts on that:
- You don't really need that, just create a 2 of 2 inviting the other party to hold one of the keys. That would accomplish the same as your proposed 2/3 with 1 destroyed. We already support 2/2.
- We do have some cool escrow features in our labs, once they are more developed we will let the community know.
@_date: 2015-02-02 00:23:51
Nothing down on our end, no support calls from them either. Terminal is up.

That's exactly how it works. There is no way for the manufacturer to know the user's supplied entropy.

A think a paragraph about single use bearer bond under "Securing your bitcoins" because Opendime is a storage device would be appropriate. It's also interesting to note that it's a secure way of generating a private key even on a compromised computer.

- Our hardware point-of-sale terminals operate just like debit and credit card payment terminals, and they allow you to accept Bitcoins &amp; Litecoins.
- We supply Bitcoin debit cards so your customers don't even need a phone, tablet or computer to use digital currencies.
- We support multiple cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Litecoin, Testnet and more coming).
- And we offer much more!
PS: the whole motive for us to create the online wallet was the fact that me and Peter didn't like or felt comfortable with any of the current web wallets. They were either not secure enough, funds not fully available or a trap in case we forgot the password. We think we found the right balance.

I deleted my post because u/dochex can explain more accurately.
@_date: 2013-11-12 23:41:09
I already started taking donations in the name of redcross, but we could setup a separate page for FR33Aid. If you can connect us with someone from there to get them an account would be great!.

For the 10th time, this is wrong. See my other answers in this thread.

It is indeed a great thing.

No, but maybe one day we will open source it.

They don't have the key to be able to sign a message with the correct answer.
@_date: 2017-06-21 16:02:23
This is not a real attack vector, because the [manufacturer doesn't create/know the private keys]( 
@_date: 2017-06-21 15:06:12
first pass:
- [Opendime]( is a small USB stick that allows you to spend Bitcoin by physically passing it along multiple times, so it's anonymous and tangible like a dollar bill. One of the advantages is the private key is generated on the device itself, so even if the computer is compromised it is still secure.  It's very simple to use,  no app installation required.  To initiate it,  load it or check the balance, simply connect to a USB port. To redeem the Bitcoin in it, you need to unseal it and sweep the private key like a paper wallet.

When we tell merchants:
* Zero to very small fees
* No charge backs
* Instant deposit to their accounts
They get the point.

Thanks Jamie!
@_date: 2013-11-03 17:25:12
I got tired of dealing with offline wallets, we built Coinkite.com, a full reserve online wallet like blockchain.info but with more features and support, I moved all my coins there. We provide a way for you to keep a copy of the private key. 
We also let you create multiple accounts with the same email or no email at all, this way even if you get caught with a key logger or something, you don't have everything on the same place.
It's a paid service, if you want an invite let me know.
@_date: 2013-11-04 16:27:40
@_date: 2013-12-31 18:04:38
Nothing. However, that would be a crime.

This is to Red Cross Canada, they are getting matched donations form the Gov.
@_date: 2013-11-01 05:01:36
You are certainly entitled to your opinion. I'd suggest you get out and chat with different retailers about their hardware preference, you'd be amazed with the abuse this things take on a daily base. This machine also has a serial port/api that already works with 99% of registers and POS out there. 
@_date: 2017-06-21 19:03:18

New post coming up here 
**UPDATE**: 
We are updating to let you know we have already collected over 5 BTC for the people of the Philippines, and growing fast! In the next 48 hours we will be donating all the proceeds directly to the Red Cross Canada, with this and all donations up until december 9th being matched dollar for dollar by the Government of Canada. After the 9th, please donate directly to the Red Cross.
**UPDATE**  
We are chatting with a Red Cross Canada Analyst who just setup an account on our site. We will make their account free for ever as soon as their emails are all verified and TOTP is setup. Within the next 48hrs the funds will be transferred to their Private Key. Will make sure everything is 100% transparent.
**UPDATE**  Statement from Canadian Red Cross:
 
“CoinKite is raising funds on behalf of the Canadian Red Cross for those affected by Typhoon Haiyan. They have generously agreed to waive all fees associated with these donations so that the Red Cross can put all of the money to good use helping those in need. Thank you for your support!” – Teilo Moore, Analyst and Corporate Relations Coordinator 
The original reddit thread: 
Here is our official blog post!
bonus: the Government of Canada is matching all these donations, so your bitcoins will work twice as hard for the victims.

Neat. Do you have an API?

No. These pub keys refer to private keys on the server, and the ship has only a serial number, no secrets on the card.
@_date: 2013-09-06 13:01:15
Insanely lower fees, no charge backs and taxation at the exchange point only.
There is no way to legally do the above for the near future, those guys are not letting BTC in. When it's possible we will be happy to do it.

@_date: 2013-09-06 05:13:59
Yes, but we will be rolling out our own debit machines, very much like Moneris, with the addition to QR Code readers. They are GSM and international. Retailer will have very good incentive to use them... As soon as they are ready for pre order we will release more info.
@_date: 2013-10-28 21:27:22
Appreciate the point, will change on the post. Can't change the reddit post title though.

Odd, I use a username not my card anymore, give your bank a ring. 
@_date: 2013-11-04 19:15:22
1. We do not deal with Fiat, at all!
2. Our POS works with any other wallet
3. If the US becomes hostile towards ฿, the world is a big place.
@_date: 2013-10-25 21:50:39
Thanks, it means a lot.

I'd personally trust a Opendime over a windows machine any day. But I'm bias I made them.
@_date: 2013-11-29 19:58:39
No. Does not work in the way you are thinking. It calls the HQ to do all the functions.

You should post on coinforum.ca some French Speaking Canadians there :)
@_date: 2017-06-21 15:22:12
- 1 &amp; 2 The key is [generated using entropy from the user]( so if that was the case the manufacturer has no way of knowing the private keys.
- 3 the [device can sign a message to prove it's authenticity](

@_date: 2013-10-20 02:17:38
@_date: 2013-10-20 02:28:09
We have a different business model.
- Paid service
- All your coins are allocated and auditable in the block chain
- We pay the miner's fee as well.
- The POS is a big deal
There are more reasons, you will figure finds out as you use the system. 
We are not competing, they are the free option.
@_date: 2013-11-24 17:15:53
Could you add  to the web wallet list? 
@_date: 2013-10-29 15:39:57
Well if you don't have an account with us like every other wallet we need to wait for a few confirmations, that's just how Bitcoin works.
@_date: 2013-10-25 16:44:17
Just use the Feedback and Bug buttons to let us know of anything.
@_date: 2013-10-09 16:44:06
Not sure what you mean, we do have a per transaction option.
@_date: 2013-12-13 05:00:31
Not at this point, we are mailing it free to "Standard" and "Business" membership types.
@_date: 2013-11-05 00:46:34

No. We do very easily integrate with services like BitPay. We made a conscious choice to not have any exposure to Fiat to be able to be a world product.

Take a chance and read our faq, we are actually doing everything the bitcoin way. Our terminal can accept payments from any other wallets. Our fees cover support and development.
@_date: 2013-10-28 18:59:04
Well, you only do that once, it's the price of security.
@_date: 2013-12-13 05:51:28
Terminals are Wifi+GPRS combo, we will ship with a SIM card and pay the bill for now.
@_date: 2013-09-06 05:19:51
No, all of our transactions happen on the block chain for transparency. However, if we have both sides as our users we can validate it instantly. 
We are making the wallet that we wanted for ourselves!
@_date: 2013-11-30 04:01:08
Because we cannot secure it. There is no protectionism, it's all still bitcoin, any device can send bitcoin to your Coinkite account.
@_date: 2013-11-15 13:08:36
Q1 2014, we might ship a few before.
@_date: 2013-10-08 21:15:34
We have 500 of them, because they are so transparent we can't print the pubkey QR codes on the back. Maybe we will give them away at store level for free since they can still be used with the machine.
What 1 of the boxes looks like:
 
Can do some cool things with light:
@_date: 2013-11-05 22:06:19
Yeah, nothing we can do there. 
Take our lead, start charging your clients in Bitcoin. This way, why would you need an exchange? :)
@_date: 2013-11-04 23:20:56
Yes, it's an international product.
@_date: 2013-10-12 13:38:58
Depending on the spot on the line, week or two.
@_date: 2013-11-26 01:58:54
We are a paid service, the terminal will be zero transaction fees. We are building a business, it costs money to provide a good service.
The standard account is only around 9 bucks a month or 120/year.
@_date: 2013-11-12 16:56:56
This is an international product, it's basically impossible to compare to every bank in the world.
What would you like to know?
@_date: 2013-11-04 19:39:52
I understand, we are trying to make it as good as possible for the user, but unfortunately under the lack of legislation around bitcoin we have to put in some precautions.
Our system is full reserve, you can audit your funds on the blockchain every second if you'd like. Under the Advance tab, we provide a download button for a CSV with all your transactions. We also let you have your private key for a fee.
@_date: 2013-12-17 19:06:54
Thank you
@_date: 2013-10-28 18:01:38
We will need an address to ship the card, but we don't even require email to create an account for you. But we are very clear, we do comply with Canadian law.

Thanks, there is a lot to do! 
Glad to see mainstream interested, people are hungry for fair financial instruments.
@_date: 2013-11-25 18:32:22
I keep all my coins at Coinkite.com, we use HSMs and custom bitcoin/litecoin wallet code (BIPS0032) to keep things safe. All the funds are full-reserve in your own private key, none of this all into a massive pool of coins bull$hit. And anyone that has been using the service knows how the uptime is awesome. We receive less than 1 ticket per thousand user per day, and those are only for forgotten passwords or silly things.

@_date: 2013-10-07 16:15:31
That's what I call service!
@_date: 2013-12-13 14:07:22
It's zero transaction fees for the paid accounts, a lot of people don't have issues with paying for services that provide value, things like good support cost money.

You can buy .4 BTC at the moment.

Yes, we host your wallet. But in BIP 32 fashion under your own private key that we generate.
This can also accept payments from ANY other wallet!

It's obvious, you have not bothered to read the actual tech spec.

Thank You All for The Help, G'night For Now.
@_date: 2013-10-28 21:44:09
Give it a try you will understand the benefits.
@_date: 2013-11-04 16:32:42
We are going to have the lowest fee of them all. stay tuned.
@_date: 2013-11-29 15:02:50
Just sign up for an invite on the site and you will get it in a few min. we are expediting them today.
@_date: 2013-11-20 00:13:58
There is a sense of camaraderie here, quite like this one.
@_date: 2013-11-24 06:34:48
We do go above and beyond, but i will definitely add those to the list of possible optional features.
@_date: 2013-11-05 01:36:24
No, that's only for withdraw from the "mini" account. If you use the card at the POS that's waved.
@_date: 2013-12-31 18:44:31
Thank you, that means a lot.
@_date: 2013-11-13 00:07:28
Hey +interested in the above?
@_date: 2013-10-01 14:01:10
We will start pre-ordering our rugged PCI-compliant hardware later this month!
Some more info on this link and more info later this month.
@_date: 2013-12-18 03:21:45
We already have a ton of pre-orders.

@_date: 2013-10-29 12:32:20
No, if you are selling your coins you choose the exchange rate. Just like when you buy in person at a satoshi square.
@_date: 2013-10-20 03:25:53
Should have redirected, go to "/welcome"
@_date: 2013-12-17 19:11:37
On that, one advantage is that we have quite a few companies worldwide who already train and install POS interested or already ordering.
@_date: 2013-11-30 04:00:02
No, we are not integrating with the fiat financial system it's too much legislation hassle and each country is different.
@_date: 2013-11-29 20:53:11
Ok you have the gift! Thank you, I will use that next time.
@_date: 2013-11-29 23:16:26
We are working on automating it.
0 transaction fees.
Retailers can set their own exchange rates.

@_date: 2013-05-08 16:01:08
Gah... another bootstrap site.. at least change the colours of the links, that's just lazy.
@_date: 2013-10-28 17:04:12
Very hard, at least at this stage. All this features make the POS a bit more expensive to manufacture. We will make it easy for you to make a profit on the spread.
@_date: 2013-11-05 05:10:35
There is no magic, can't have it all. 
We will allow merchants to set amount of confirmations if they choose to do so.
@_date: 2013-12-31 20:05:22
Awesome, It's just a couple block away from Coinkite's office!
@_date: 2013-10-24 00:38:26
what do you mean by an app?
@_date: 2013-12-31 18:33:28
It's unfortunate for them, I don't believe that would be the case for most. I've converted Red Cross Canada :)
@_date: 2013-12-18 03:01:25
No need to go online, they can check it with the terminal.
@_date: 2013-11-12 14:55:28
Awesome! Thanks.
@_date: 2013-11-24 05:53:51
It would be cost prohibitive.
@_date: 2013-10-20 01:33:33
was pushing an update.
looking over the exceptions... give me a couple min.
@_date: 2013-09-23 14:00:28
I can't edit it anymore. :(
@_date: 2013-11-29 16:21:02
Our POS supports NFC, but it is inherently insecure and with bitcoins there is no reversing. We decided to not do that for now.
@_date: 2018-12-28 21:19:21
can you add Coldcard's response there too? 
@_date: 2013-11-05 02:11:16

In the next 48 hours we will send whatever we have collected.
and the remainder will be dealt with before the 9th, please donate directly after the 9th.
@_date: 2013-09-20 22:19:51
That is for our own smart card network, it will enable you to access your funds in locations with our debit terminals, which will we start doing pre-orders very soon. It also has a pubkey on the back, making it easy for you to get paid by a friends.
We will make it very easy for you to deposit funds through 3rd Exchange APIs.
Yes, its an HD wallet. We only transact through the blockchain including for internal transfers, this way you can always audit your funds.
More technical info next week.

Your missing the fact that the Private keys sit inside an HSM they never have seen the light of day.

With that spelling would have been :)
@_date: 2013-11-13 15:31:47
I don't know if you noticed that my original post was yesterday before anyone had offered to do anything. And it was just a reddit post. I'm happy more people are helping now, but why are you bashing this?
On top of that, this was not a campaign on Coinkite at all, It's a personal thing. I only posted on the blog for legitimacy.
@_date: 2013-09-06 22:26:36
Like Amex? I have one, no one takes it anymore.
You still can do any transaction just like every other wallet out there, more securely of course.
I get your point, things take time.

Bitcoin provides other benefits.

Sorry dude, it's way too much work, I have real work to do. It's not that hard to prevent spam, and PHPbb is ancient. I find it ironic that i was never allow to post and yet had to change my password due to their wholes. I was actually going to comment on this OSX Native wallet post, make some Coinkite announcements and other things there. I dont know any other place that has this much barriers of entry. 
Maybe in the future I will try again, for now best of luck to them.

You don't have BTC anywhere else??? 
It's crazy to keep money in exchanges, they go down all the time.
At least use the promo code to create an account, so you have a place to keep your BTCs safe and liquid.

LOL, no, shipping on Q1, where did you see that?
@_date: 2013-11-04 16:57:38
Which fees you peak of?
1. If you have our cards = no fees
2. If you have your own wallet = no fees
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:17:34
No worries, many people don't.

The "evil manufacturer" would be robing itself. Most users would only deposit on Opendimes they initiated themselves. It would also be the end of the business, because it will be public it was defrauding users.

Just to be clear, we are a full-reserve BIP32 wallet system, all your coins are in a key assigned to you. Unlike other wallets we can't play with your money. It literally makes no difference if you have 0000.1 or 1000 Bitcoin in your account to us. Lot's more info here

* You can activate/deactivate/change-pin on your web wallet
* Yes

It's not an QuickBT issue, its Desjardins that doesn't want to be part of interac online, you should let your bank know.

I never claimed that this is the solution for all businesses. But there is a massive market for this form factor. And on top of that we have built a Tier 1 web wallet and debit cards to support it.

Big QR code or Bitcoin Address

We built a system that is currency agnostic, we believe in the future of Cryptocurrencies. Litecoin is the second most used, so why not support it?

Glad you liked, our fees are reasonable if you are looking for an independent company that can pay its bills without selling your information or playing with your funds on the exchange :)
We are in for the long term, the first Cryptobank! 
Note: fees were set before this massive BTC spike, if it keeps trending up we will match it down.

Besides the POS we offer "Banking" where you coins are safe, auditable and easy to spend.
We would love to work with current large POS vendors too. 
@_date: 2013-05-18 20:10:17
We've put it online now 
@_date: 2013-12-31 18:24:41
Yes, we are a paid service because we can't play with your money, don't sell your information and don't display ads. If you are on the monthly plan there are no fees, you could send a thousands of bitcoin transactions and not get charged more than the 10 bucks a month. 
That also pays for great immediate support, which all the other free wallets lack. 
To be fair, we don't charge the first time the "Mini/Saver" account holder takes the money out we create an invoice, if they do like the service and keep using they get charged. 
We have a satisfaction guarantee policy, 14 day money back if you don't like the service. Also free for most charities and some non-profits, they can apply under pricing details.

Same as above, we are taking way too much traffic. Have a sip of coffee wait a few min and refresh.
@_date: 2013-11-04 22:28:58
@_date: 2013-10-07 23:18:13
I give up, not even posting on the newbies works... places with that kind of barriers, are not inclusive and don't deserve traffic.
@_date: 2013-11-13 23:16:40
Two more things, the Cards also have your pub address on the back with a QR code and the Terminals send/receive payments to any other wallet service.
@_date: 2013-05-15 13:17:01
I'm not sure, it was just posted on HN.
@_date: 2013-10-15 13:41:49
I thought it was the car company too.
@_date: 2013-11-04 23:49:52
This is not a simple computer, its an HSM, in a secure location. Just like banks do.
Yes, you can have a copy of your private key, we charge to discourage it. Because once the key has seen the light of day on your computer we can guarantee its integrity anymore. 
@_date: 2013-11-05 15:05:18
Its an international product, no Fiat.
@_date: 2013-10-20 01:40:28
@_date: 2013-12-16 17:45:35
Yes, referral program is coming, stay tuned.
@_date: 2013-10-12 22:11:43
Can't talk about the chip model :)
@_date: 2013-12-17 20:51:54
We designed our system's the Bitcoin way, anyone can transact in and out with addresses. 
@_date: 2013-05-19 18:14:21
We are back up.
@_date: 2013-10-16 16:41:45
We had some improvements and posted on the forum.
@_date: 2013-10-24 00:48:13
Works on your phone browser. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 14:58:39
Did you get it?
@_date: 2013-11-29 03:11:16
You can deactivate/cancel the account if you are going to use it.
I can do it for you, email support.
@_date: 2013-11-05 00:34:12
@_date: 2013-09-06 12:49:22
Not at this time, we are making it easy for the retailer to accept Bitcoins, so there won't be any necessity to use Fiat at the affiliate locations.
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:16:08
Probably early next year.
@_date: 2013-11-06 06:11:12
Good stuff.
@_date: 2013-10-21 16:35:25
We did sent a whole bunch, lots more coming later today.
and we did this session Sat 
@_date: 2013-12-31 17:31:49
Give it a go, it will help show them the value. I'm sure it will make them come around to displaying the logo and officially accepting.
@_date: 2013-10-23 18:26:18
@_date: 2013-10-01 03:44:27
I will be speaking at the bitcoin summit it will be fun. But it is a different kind of event, not a meetup.
@_date: 2013-11-04 20:50:28
Invite sent.
@_date: 2013-10-16 18:32:04
Not at the moment.
@_date: 2013-10-11 18:21:46
LOL... there is always someone.
@_date: 2013-10-21 14:01:16
Its for small quantities, it would cost too much to reverse it, would not be worth it.
@_date: 2013-10-04 23:23:42
Good point
@_date: 2013-11-13 21:38:09
Noted. I was made aware in a comment bellow.

Yes! GPRS (GSM) + Wifi.
@_date: 2013-11-04 14:53:47
Thanks! You guys have been a great partner.
@_date: 2013-12-30 01:38:20
Nice! Right now we are only shipping cards to paid accounts and non-profits. 
As soon as the self ordering system is ready for the Mini/Saver accounts you will get an email.
@_date: 2013-11-04 18:05:50
@_date: 2013-11-05 17:49:17
That's the title of the actual article. It's bad for Coinkite because we are actually international. I sent an errata to the publication, still haven't heard back.
@_date: 2013-12-17 17:56:26
You are right, I could have been nicer, 
but unlike most companies we are not robots. 
Will be nicer next time :)
@_date: 2013-11-29 17:41:34
You get it on your welcome email.
@_date: 2013-09-25 00:38:38
Also sign up for an invite at coinkite.com, we will be opening up in a few weeks.
@_date: 2013-11-23 20:26:32
It's an international product, we will ship anywhere. We built our own network. We will try to make it as cheap as possible, but will be more than what it is today.
@_date: 2013-11-23 20:07:32
Yes, we would discount more but can't tell how the BTC price will hold the next few days. Send a support ticket if you are still having issues i will take it from there.
@_date: 2013-10-28 14:14:38
We do not operate with Fiat, we have a 100% above board business and we intend comply with any legislation Canada may add to this space.
@_date: 2013-11-29 18:57:00
Thank you, but Jason will put it to better use.

We will have this prices soon
@_date: 2013-10-28 14:10:18
Here, watch me embarrass myself for 30min so you can see the vision we have 
@_date: 2013-09-06 15:12:16
We would love to, but at the current state of Bitcoin acceptance by the incumbent transaction networks would be unlikely.
@_date: 2013-11-01 03:28:24
You get it.
@_date: 2013-10-20 01:52:47
@_date: 2013-09-06 15:28:05
Because it's an easier interface. 
"Debit" has nothing to do with "Credit" or  "Currencies" in general. It's just a machine that takes a authorized amount and give to the merchant.
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:10:37
It's a thermal printer :)
@_date: 2013-11-30 04:12:11
For Canada we could push to any of the exchanges of your choice. QuickBT is also working on a merchant solution.
@_date: 2013-10-28 18:59:31
@_date: 2013-10-21 13:16:59
We are sending a few more later today. Will make sure you get one.
@_date: 2013-11-29 14:35:30
Doesn't matter, it's not like debit/credit cards this has real web support, including option for 2FA!
@_date: 2013-12-13 13:11:57
Early next year. And a few trial units next week.
@_date: 2013-11-13 16:10:21

You can easily cancel your Card only, we are also working on 2FA for debit cards.
@_date: 2013-10-28 16:48:11
All power to you. Let us know when if works out, we will be happy to have our cards work on it.
@_date: 2013-11-29 20:40:19
@_date: 2013-10-16 18:33:15
You mean you want to buy 100USD worth of Bitcoins, it's an exchange operation. Some retailer maybe choose to sell you their BTCs and those could be deposited on your account instantly.

No for that reason, it's redeemable on our site. We are still figuring out the right way to print a secure private key,
@_date: 2013-12-21 16:43:22
It was surprisingly good, the second guy that is stationed in US really understood and explained well.
@_date: 2013-10-08 22:36:03
We will be revealing the Hardware price sometime before the end of the month. Hint, its very competitive.

We are giving away 100mBTC for show off the feature. Check it out 
@_date: 2013-10-28 13:02:50
We thought of it, you can print that QR :)
This type of display doesn't have enough resolution for that.
@_date: 2013-11-04 16:54:29
Thank you! Use Coinkite and keep the feedback coming :)
@_date: 2013-11-13 15:12:34
We went as far as Full-reserve with Coinkite, but insuring accounts would make the service way too expensive. Maybe one day.
@_date: 2013-12-17 18:41:10
This is a "Bitcoin community" video preview, we will make realife demos at some point.
@_date: 2013-10-21 22:09:33
Hang in there, they are coming. 
@_date: 2013-10-28 14:12:57
We will have more material soon. But what's fascinating is when people we show this to hold it in their hands, they immediately understand. They already have an EMV machine that puts money in their account after the consumer pays them. We are doing the same, and will integrate with the exchange of choice to make their live even simpler.
@_date: 2013-10-17 12:28:22
This one is slightly transparent. But is not like the other one.
@_date: 2013-09-20 21:36:18
You have a point.
We are releasing all the info early next week.
@_date: 2013-10-21 14:13:29

@_date: 2013-11-05 19:33:06
What is CC and PP? 
@_date: 2013-10-28 21:47:52
No, we work on the blockchain and unlike some other tools out there we allow you to transact very easy with any others.
We are making a safe and transparent place for you to keep your coins, there are many that don't want to deal with personal wallets. We built the wallet we wanted for ourselves.

Would be awesome if you guys automated 
Charity donations, by maintaining a charity list. 
Something like
"+donate all SeansOutpost"
"+donate all random"
"+donate all spread"
instead of 
"+$2usd verify"

It's a personal campaign by me. 
Posted on Coinkite's blog for legitimacy.

@_date: 2013-09-06 14:21:16
"If You're Not Paying for It; You're the Product"
1. Yes, Minimal, we need to pay bills and run a business.
2. Prices will be released soon.
3. Yes, many new security features, FAQs will be published soon.
4. Prices will be released soon. We are self funded, we need to pay for inventory.
*edited for spelling :)
@_date: 2013-11-04 18:55:13
We are building our own network. This cards will allow you to use Bitcoins on our POS without a need for a computer or phone. They also can be used as a payment receiver with the PubKey on the back.
@_date: 2013-10-28 13:30:22
@_date: 2013-10-16 18:37:06
Yes, but they come from their Coinkite account, so it's in their interest to sell you and make a cut on the spread.
Think long term. Other companies will make it easier for you to get bitcoins, we will make it easy for you to spend them.
@_date: 2013-10-30 17:37:30
Thanks for the mention (from Coinkite) 
We are happy to support Cryptocurrencies that reach critical mass.
@_date: 2013-10-12 00:02:35
Thats the same standard chip you find in your bank card. 
We could do RFID but increases cost.
@_date: 2013-09-06 05:10:32
Yes, you will just pay with your BTCs either with the Coinkite Card (accounts denominated in BTC or LTC) easy and instant because is within our network or from any other source (electrum, phone wallet, etc...).
We are working on making it as easy as possible for retailers, I can't expand much more at this point.
@_date: 2013-10-17 04:39:05
Developer I'd assume?
@_date: 2013-11-04 19:08:34

@_date: 2013-11-29 16:44:13
That truly means a lot.
@_date: 2013-10-11 17:51:10
We are starting our own network — Simple as that.
Yeah, that's a big plan.
@_date: 2013-10-29 13:00:12
@_date: 2013-09-27 15:08:43
We will start sending invites slowly in next month, right now only few have access to our site.
TL;DR It's coming soon. :)
@_date: 2013-11-23 20:03:24
I had some issues like that in the past. I became tired of using cold storage for checking account money (few $K) and so did my co-founder, that's why we build the online banking part of Coinkite — Ended up using it for all I have.
@_date: 2013-11-29 14:34:20
We list the open transactions the on machine and let them choose how many confirmations.
They can also re-scan the receipt. 
If the user have a Coinkite account we can do 0 confirmations.
@_date: 2013-12-31 14:57:33
Don't just as ask! 
Start sending Bitcoin with Coinkite Send to Emails to those that don't accept yet! 
They will see all these coins piling up on their inbox and will feel the need to redeem. 
Once they get their feet wet, it gets easier!
I.e.: 
@_date: 2013-10-10 13:29:39
Very cool. 
@_date: 2013-11-04 18:40:27
It's already happening!
(I'm from Coinkite, Toronto)
@_date: 2013-09-24 21:07:31
We don't have something with those words, just added to the list to be updated!
Thanks for the feedback (keep it coming)
@_date: 2013-12-22 23:09:13
One per account, that's all you need. 
@_date: 2013-10-01 12:43:15
We enable Customers and Merchants to transact in bitcoin on both online and physical mediums — just as you would do it with online banking and debit card.
Check out our FAQs, coinkite.com/faq
@_date: 2013-10-16 16:15:38
- That is correct. 
- The inverse is also possible, anyone with no card can pay BTCs to the retailer that has our machines.
- If you have a card and an account with us, you can print invoices and and a lot of other stuff at the retailer's machine
- If you have a paid account you get the card for free*
- We are working on a Affiliate program for the POSes too, a lot of demand.
- We also offer "Bitcoin Online Banking", we like to think that it provides more than a standard wallet, including LTC support.
*for now and shipping maybe extra depending where you are.
@_date: 2013-11-12 17:45:57
I've just talked to them on the phone, while they figure out with the finance department if they can accept in ฿ as opposed to USD I'm creating them an free account on Coinkite.
@_date: 2013-10-29 12:33:57
The machine is NFC capable, but we decided the NFC is not safe enough for BTC. It's the same reason why EMV only allow small amounts on NFC.
@_date: 2013-12-17 21:48:36
If both parties are on Coinkite we can do instant. This feature will be coming early next year. 
@_date: 2013-09-25 00:37:21
We will slowly let people in, no set numbers.
You will be able to buy through a third party wish we will integrate as seamless as possible. 
@_date: 2013-09-06 17:57:50
I think you are missing our point, there is a lot of people outside north america on slow networks with dumb phones.
Also, on that flow they need to already have wallets and a basic understanding of bitcoin — everyone understands debit cards.
We want something robust and scalable, our machines can be dropped in the middle of the desert, if they have GSM signal they can exchange. These machines also support manual transactions by typing pubkey or QR codes and most importantly handle security.
By the way, our cards have the pubkey on the back, very easy to receive payments from others having a phone.
It's a turn key solution.
@_date: 2013-12-13 01:34:42
We operate worldwide.
@_date: 2013-09-16 18:14:44
You could do escrow with a third party.
@_date: 2013-11-29 13:38:37
* The paid wallet service already has thousands of users.
* Because we charge we can offer real support, noticed no one complaining on reddit about us?
* This terminals can accept payment from any wallet, they are a Bitcoin solution. (e.g.: Coinbase, Android Wallet, Anything!)
* Zero transactions fees and integrates with registers.
* Zero fees for card usage on the user end.
* We are a real business, making a profit to make even more products. 
* As we scale prices will drop.

We are an open and transparent independent business based in Toronto, Canada. We take security seriously and believe in great support. We have business continuity plans and we have mechanisms in place in case we go way. 
Unlike other wallets we keep your money allocated in a private key assigned to you (residing in an HSM) which we give you encrypted. We do that so that we can guarantee that the transactions are yours, but in the event of us having to close doors, we can broadcast a key, this way even if we don't exist anymore you can still get your funds.
We already have thousands of users, but because our system actually works, you don't hear much complaints on reddit. We also issue refunds within the trial period.
If you want more info about the security and architecture:  and general faq here 
We also care about privacy, and follow the Personal Information Protection Policy 
At the end of the day, the only way for you to understand what we are about is giving it a try, put as much as you feel comfortable.

1. It is compatible with any wallet than you can scan a QR code. I've spoken with them briefly, we are not sure yet about their cards.
2. No, insure at this moment would make it prohibitively expensive. We do have other security solutions, including a dead man switch in case we go away you can still get you money. 
3. Not closed to the idea, but not at this moment.
@_date: 2013-11-05 00:08:00

Have a link?
@_date: 2013-10-17 04:14:15
Sent you guys an email :)
@_date: 2013-11-22 16:49:53
Yes, we looked into it at Coinkite, the insurance was too expensive. We would have to charge you too much and would make the memberships not worth it.
@_date: 2013-09-30 17:42:34
cool, will x-post
@_date: 2013-10-20 01:59:14
@_date: 2013-10-07 20:13:16
I will look again, if its a lot of trouble I will pass. Coinforum.ca is a lot friendlier to newbies.
@_date: 2013-12-30 00:19:59
You are missing **
@_date: 2013-12-13 17:11:51
No, they have to have our terminal. Which allows for for them to receive from you with our card or any other wallet (phone, coinbase, blockchain.info, etc...)
It's all here 
@_date: 2013-11-28 18:51:34
That's exactly why we didn't just make the Poin-of-Sale Terminal, we needed a secure web wallet to keep coins safe and accessible.
@_date: 2013-10-20 02:53:42
Appreciate the note, Bitcoin/Money-instruments make things more complicated.
Let us know how you like the site. And by the way, interac for small amounts through QuickBt works great!
@_date: 2013-11-04 16:36:52
Our pleasure!
@_date: 2013-10-20 01:11:11
@_date: 2013-10-16 18:34:13
We go further, this is just a bank card, a bitcoin bank card. We offer the whole backing infrastructure too.
@_date: 2013-11-04 22:03:26
Why is it so hard to believe its actually really cheap if you pay for the whole year, basically a latte per month.
@_date: 2013-10-12 13:05:19
@_date: 2013-12-31 15:40:48
You can cancel it anytime before it get's redeemed because you have the PIN.
@_date: 2013-11-04 19:40:15
@_date: 2013-10-07 16:53:15
This is getting interesting.
@_date: 2013-12-04 19:33:06
Not necessarily, you can pay from your Coinbase account.
@_date: 2013-11-07 17:47:24
Thanks for the vote of confidence on Coinkite.
Let us know how we can make things more clear and we will.
@_date: 2013-11-29 17:28:03
We are still working on the pricing. will be cheaper for paid accounts.
@_date: 2013-11-29 16:40:14
Even cooler, each person on the table can send their portion to the same pub key, when total is reached it shows as paid!
@_date: 2013-10-28 19:50:36
Sorry, I misread your message. 
We need to support empty accounts, takes a toll. 
I do get your point, we might change that in the future. This is good feedback.
@_date: 2013-09-19 03:49:18
You mean "blockchain.info", not "blockchain" these are very different things.
@_date: 2013-10-23 23:58:29
We are in for the long run :)
@_date: 2013-10-07 20:03:29
Yeah, i couldn't find the rules.
@_date: 2013-10-29 12:55:52
Yes, merchant can accept bitcoins from anyone.
@_date: 2013-11-12 21:59:25
Thanks, Tell everyone to keep upvoting this thread
@_date: 2013-11-23 20:01:56
If you get a machine we send one with it.
They will be ready soon, should be shipping in a couple weeks.
Some lucky ppl already have it.
@_date: 2013-10-01 12:40:19
Thanks! i will check if tumblr supports it.

Awesome! Looking forward to having you as a customer.
Message if you have any questions.
@_date: 2013-12-13 00:08:50
You are correct, i sent extra for his classmates.
@_date: 2013-11-01 15:51:20
QuickBT is a great partner, thanks for the Coinkite shout out.
PS: If you need an invite just say it here. 
@_date: 2013-10-21 16:04:19
Ask the bank. 
@_date: 2013-10-29 04:06:00
Well, there is nothing we can do about that, besides tell you that we will make money from it not on it, so our incentive is to ship.
@_date: 2013-12-05 05:38:40
It was awesome, 50 ppl surrounding us! Didn't get a chance to do a video. Will make something soon.
@_date: 2013-10-28 13:58:12
We are in for the long term. 
Start seeing how the world will be a few years from now, and start building stuff for then or we will never get there.
We already have huge interest from actual retailer, not the BTC community :)
@_date: 2013-12-13 14:59:11
The invites go out, just request one.
@_date: 2013-10-20 01:15:01

Phones break with the amount of usage retails has. They can also be stolen because of the multiple purposes. You'd be surprised at the stuff you hear about retailer hardwarez
@_date: 2013-12-30 01:39:11
Got it!

Hackerne.ws Discussion 
@_date: 2013-10-29 14:59:58
NO, they can accept bitcoins from anywhere, the bitcoin way. They will have a pub address.
@_date: 2013-11-04 16:40:28
Card transactions will not have fees.
And yes we are the paid option. 
We are trying to build a real business, with revenue.
PS: you don't have to transfer to Coinkite first, our POS can take the payment from any wallet!
@_date: 2013-09-06 12:30:00

@_date: 2013-10-28 20:38:26
Check out the card Cavirtex has for that.

Small team. Too much stuff to do, the writing suffers.
@_date: 2013-11-12 17:48:54
It's very easy to say "Why can't someone...", I went and did it. Either do it or stop complaining. 
@_date: 2013-10-28 19:10:34
Please, do send me a better version.
@_date: 2013-12-17 20:24:56
Exactly. We already have web QR code reader code almost ready, so a mobile web version will be out likely sooner.
@_date: 2013-10-07 15:39:06
Still waiting for it's arrival. 
I'm a bigger fan of the medium :)
Are you in T.O.?
You could drop by for a sampling.

@_date: 2013-11-05 00:48:52
On the way Sir.
@_date: 2013-11-05 05:13:07
* The terminal is just an interface to our infrastructure, so it goes to your account on Coinkite.
* No, but we will have extra safeguards.
* The price and features are here 
@_date: 2013-10-01 03:43:50
Well it will be the first, and so far the ppl coming are actually building things. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 19:36:23
It's just a Saturday flash sale. Enjoy :) 
@_date: 2013-12-17 20:27:50
There are many other advantages on the card not containing it, the main one, if you lose the card you don't lose your money.
@_date: 2013-10-08 23:17:18
Good you point that out, Coinkite is a full-reserve, you can audit your fund.

@_date: 2013-10-20 22:32:51
PM me your email, I will send you the invite.
@_date: 2013-10-21 19:37:33
Is coming soon. We had a backlog.
@_date: 2013-09-06 14:33:20
We can beat that. Also, remember, the rest of the world pays a lot more!
@_date: 2013-11-04 17:38:42
1. You may take your money out the first time. We create a dept, if you did like your service and bring money back in again you get charged that. 
2. If you have a paid account you don't pay any % fees.
3. If you have that account and use it to pay retailer we charge you nothing.
@_date: 2013-09-16 18:56:43
And here in Canada. 
@_date: 2013-11-04 17:35:22
@_date: 2013-12-17 16:42:03
1. This terminal has a secure connection to coinkite.com where transactions are processed.
2. Yes, we will support all that is requested, as long as there is enough interest and an exchange reference point.
@_date: 2013-10-08 11:35:42
Fair enough, I don't mean to bash it, just very annoyed by it.
@_date: 2013-10-25 16:29:11
@_date: 2013-10-20 01:35:56
Thanks man, account is yours to keep from now on. 
Lots of updates and new features coming!
You can now buy btc with debit for low quantities if you are canadian.
We can talk about what the features hold just yet, for now just a nice secure place to keep your btcs and an awesome hardware terminal shipping soon :)
@_date: 2013-10-21 14:48:04
If you are a saver, use the "mini" account on Coinkite and there is no monthly fee.
@_date: 2013-11-04 19:35:43
Until it is legislated there is nothing else we can do.
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:03:24
Back at 1.1, will go up if the exchange rate keeps on going down.
@_date: 2013-10-20 01:31:44
try again in 1min
@_date: 2013-11-04 18:05:55
@_date: 2013-11-04 16:39:02
1. No Sir, our POS accept Bitcoin from any wallet!
2. You don't even need an email to have an account on our system
3. The cards will be available to people who don't even own a computer.

Like most BTC posts, it will likely get flagged there.
@_date: 2013-11-13 17:51:21
We started with .2 and are putting the time to promote this.
It's something i started myself first then got the Team on it.
@_date: 2013-12-13 03:15:38
BTW: If you are up for it, I can ship your terminal earlier. Firmware still in trial, so we will be constantly asking you to pull updates.
@_date: 2013-11-05 05:13:55
On the way.
@_date: 2013-10-20 01:10:32

I don't get it either.

@_date: 2013-10-16 21:30:10
We are just making the system we wanted for ourselves.
@_date: 2013-12-22 18:02:49
The terminals will appear here as they start been shipped early next year. There are a few testing units coming out sooner!

Donate directly to them 
@_date: 2013-09-13 00:08:09

@_date: 2013-11-29 14:18:42
Yes you can embed amount. 
It generates a new pub key receiving address each time tied to your original private key.
It reads QR codes too!
@_date: 2013-11-12 19:35:38
Good point, next time I will try to make it multi charity. I'm a big fan of givewell.
@_date: 2013-12-17 17:54:17
Insurance is still too expensive to repass to you, but we are investigating options. Stay tuned.
@_date: 2013-10-21 14:21:30
Let the guys from QuickBT know, my gut says it's CIBC not letting them. I might wrong, if that's the problem, change banks :)
@_date: 2013-10-04 03:08:08
Too much traffic coming in, try a different txn.
like this one 
@_date: 2013-12-01 04:58:03
It's not open source.
@_date: 2013-11-30 03:58:34
We would automatically push your coins to Bit Pay or other similar services. So you have a choice.
@_date: 2013-05-18 20:12:11
We've just took the wall off, enjoy :)
@_date: 2013-10-23 18:31:40
@_date: 2013-09-06 15:29:37
Agreed, but its the same for Fiat and yet mobile phone payments never took-off outside Asia.
It's not a winner takes all market. There is room for many mediums of transaction.
@_date: 2013-10-08 22:03:04
SmartCard just like a bank card, we will be rolling out our own debit POS machines.
@_date: 2013-10-04 20:35:08
PS: I looked here spendbitcoins.com and didnt find anything.
@_date: 2013-10-29 12:59:27
1. Retailer can buy/sell from his account
2. You can use both stand alone or hookup with the register.
@_date: 2013-10-20 01:19:40
Uppercase is not allowed.
@_date: 2013-11-29 23:17:04
These are AES 256 encrypted, it's safe.
@_date: 2013-11-04 15:57:04
Some day maybe, right now the focus is on making all this grow.
For now use the service, and keep the feedback coming!

The retailers card will have a QR Pubkey that doesn't need to be printed. You don't need a Coinkite account to pay the retailer that has our terminal. It is not centralized, people can use any wallet they want. The advantage of using our wallet is convenience, speed and security.

Most services are not doing things the **Bitcoin way**. They are trying to force accounting practices on too bitcoin. For example any service that puts them all into **one large bitcoin pool is only issuing you a bitcoin debt** like a bank would, all sitting in a large bucket waiting to be spilled over. 
Coinkite creates an address for you and allocate it to you.
@_date: 2013-10-02 13:22:11
Some sheets came with the cuts correct and some with the same exact page with it cuts wrong.

We heard you, check out the back of our cards: 
Pubkey and QR for your account :)
@_date: 2013-12-17 20:17:08
Yes, I have. It's actually pretty common for merchants to have more than one. And in restaurants and other larger places they have multiple units.
@_date: 2013-11-29 14:17:29
This machine supports both push and pull, this is not your standard debit machine.
@_date: 2013-11-29 20:03:51
No, we missed the change on the FAQ.

Thanks for the interest, we are only sending cards to monthly and yearly memberships at the moment, they get it free. For the Mini/Saver accounts we will sell the cards later on.
EDIT: I've updated the text under accounts/cards to make it more clear, it will be on the next update.
@_date: 2013-10-21 14:00:13
Really, I got my in the mail but never activated.
I don't think it should make any difference since its all through online banking on the interac network.
Did you tell the guys from QuickBT?

He is entitled to his opinion. 
It would have been way easier for us to make an app for retailer to use on their phones and tablets. But after talking to many of them about their issues with "soft touch" we decided to make this PCI certified hardware POS work with Bitcoin and Litecoin
(I'm from Coinkite)
@_date: 2013-11-04 22:21:42
Thanks for the feedback, let us know how you like the website.
@_date: 2013-12-13 15:46:39
You can use your _debit_ card to _debit_ your bitcoin/litcoin account at the point of purchase, you can also print bitcoin vouchers.
@_date: 2013-10-19 18:03:57
Which country?
@_date: 2013-10-23 16:58:29
They need solid, reliable hardware.
We are pre-ordering our PCI Compliant Hardware Terminals! They are just like the stuff any payment processor use, but our special sauce makes it transact with Bitcoin/Litecoin (
Also working on a marketing package to help you.
@_date: 2013-12-17 18:38:29
It already has that function, you can turn on the "exchange" feature if your country allows you to. It lets you do cash in hand transactions.
@_date: 2013-10-16 16:41:10
LOL... its taking a pounding.
@_date: 2013-12-13 14:12:56
It's Bitcoin, you can't prevent ppl from paying into a pubkey.
@_date: 2013-10-24 00:38:02
For the paid accounts, one is on the house. 
Shipping will be free for Canada and Most of US, if we can figure out a better deal we will try to make shipping world-wide free too.
@_date: 2013-09-27 22:38:37

Our site works on tablets, you can create payment requests, we actually have iOS development background, in time we might make an iOS App.
@_date: 2013-10-28 20:01:18
Unlike other sites, we don't pass secrets through this specific API. This specific implementation is safe. For the next level of integration and other things we have a REST implementation. 
We have a lot in the pipeline!

Yes, love how easy it is. 
We integrate right into Coinkite.
@_date: 2013-11-23 20:20:57
I hear you, its quite cool to take my Coinkite card out of the wallet and show to ppl, they are amazed when they take a pic of the pub key on the back to pay me a beer.

It will be supported on day 1 to transact on the POS, however due to physical space, only have ฿ pubkey on the back.
@_date: 2013-09-24 20:45:33
We want to enable Customers and Merchants to transact in Bitcoin on both online and physical mediums, just like you do with online banking and debit card. 
Which part is not clear and i will try to explain in a different way?

That's why I reposted :)

Hello, I'm from Coinkite. I will not discuss Andreas product as I have not used. 
I wanted to address one thing, we are not a bank, we are a cryptobank which is a very different thing, the coins are in your own key. And unlike most other web wallets, we don't put all coins together.
This is an explanation how our system works:
Coinkite is internally based on BIP32 Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallets residing in a Hardware Secure Module (HSM). Each new member receives a "welcome email" which contains the "xpubkey" (extended public key) for their deposits, and an encrypted copy of the corresponding xprivkey. The xpubkey (used for both Litecoin and Bitcoin) can be used by the account owner to see all public keys associated with their account (both past and future). Combined with the "audit" feature, you can fetch a list of all UTXO (unspent transaction outputs) associated with your account and verify the public key's subpath from the given xpubkey. Similarly, you can check the UTXO is correctly stored on the blockchain by checking it's amount at a third party data service..
In the event of the closure or other failure of the business, we will publicize the symmetric key protecting the xprivkey values that have been distributed to members. With that key, each user can recover their own funds by re-generating the private keys for each UTXO.
We understand the inherent risk of trusting a third party with the private keys for your bitcoins, and we feel this application of BIP32 helps to address these concerns should the business disappear. We consider this system to be "full-reserve" since the users are in a position to verify that their funds are not being used for any other purpose than safe-keeping, while on deposit at Coinkite.

Funny. Make it what you will.
@_date: 2013-09-06 05:02:21
There is room for many types of transaction devices. 
We will have something more robust that retailers already have experience using.
@_date: 2013-04-25 19:34:14
Wow, another one
@_date: 2013-10-04 02:52:57
A historical moment.
@_date: 2013-12-17 15:36:01
It's coming, this is just a preview :)
@_date: 2013-11-04 16:29:05
LOL... Sent.
@_date: 2013-09-06 04:38:01
Almost correct, merchants will receive BTC... BTC end to end :)
@_date: 2013-11-29 16:41:16
Because the billions of dollars invested in registers and POS all over the world, they need stuff that connects to their systems.
@_date: 2013-12-22 20:09:47
No charge backs, these are Bitcoin transactions themselves. 
You can disable or change the PIN of the card online.
@_date: 2013-12-17 17:53:35
We will be adding more options and zero transaction fees for most.

Our machines will let you pay Bitcoin &lt;&gt; Bitcoin straight to the retailer.

FinCEN is an American institution, our product is global, in most other countries where it's legal the merchant can turn on the "Exchange" functionality.
@_date: 2013-11-29 14:22:22
That's pretty funny. 
But, it's a big world out there, these talk to existing registers and POS. On top of that, it does a ton more, it can even print bitcoin vouchers.

No price yet, we are sending to the people that have the monthly paid membership for free. Soon the bottom tier will be able to pay/order.
