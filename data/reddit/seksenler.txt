No, fees are still high with btc. Can we do that with bch? Ohh wait a minute. BCH will .uck people already.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:09:06
move your coins to wallet first like exodus, then to another exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:40:44
It will be buy one get one soon.
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:30:49
They just want the name for creating confusion/misunderstanding to collect $$ from BTC buyers. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:31:42
Fork them motherforkers!

If you believe people still buy coffee with cryptos, you need to read more. Crypto is not about buying coffee anymore. Unfortunately it became something else.

“If you buy something like bitcoin or some cryptocurrency, you don’t really have anything that has produced anything,” said Buffett, 87. “You’re just hoping the next guy pays more.” 
Thats exactly how the stocks, real estate or any type of economy works. He knows this. He just does not like when money moves from stocks to crypto. You are a good guy buffet but you are just another wall street guy! Thanks for the advice.
@_date: 2019-06-27 06:50:17
Sure, another gambling site for  BTC Awareness.
@_date: 2019-06-21 02:06:59
Exodus for me.
@_date: 2019-06-16 03:11:39
If BTC hits 10K, I can afford what the little guy has :)
@_date: 2019-06-07 01:12:11
Money is gone! However, it is not easy to steal from 2 way protection. Do you remember anything at all to get an idea how they stole it? Could be someone you know or near your phone. Just thinking!
@_date: 2019-06-11 06:49:50
Remember Lee from Litecoin?
@_date: 2019-06-21 20:44:19
We see these begging/asking for $/btc a lot recently. I wonder if this ever works? Do people really except that someone out of blue will give another 2.1btc? Seriously?
@_date: 2019-06-21 01:58:40
10k is a big milestone, this will be interesting! Watching it all night!
@_date: 2019-06-16 03:09:18
Please dont!!!
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:40:24
Agreed! This guy bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-02-26 18:59:51
That’s a lot of BTC! Hold on to your chair if Thailand starts selling.  
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:16:08
5 billion is a lot of money to everyone even buffet. Hundreds of pro-traders work for him. They could not tell stock market crashing after ATH for a month? I understand you like the guy but... 
@_date: 2017-09-23 03:23:41
Yes, I am hodling my $$ until November! Sold my BTCs above 4k. I do not feel comfortable with daytrading since price is going down - too risky for me. Hodl, hodl :)
@_date: 2017-09-23 03:56:55
This guy knows ! This is my strategy - wait to buy at 5k and above to be sure! Read the post above twice!
@_date: 2017-09-23 06:33:47
Please read the article entirely. “Amazon will probably follow the others” does not mean the same thing you are claiming.

You are just new, thats all
@_date: 2017-09-23 05:03:40
People spending all of their money to buy  btc, people using credit cards to buy btc, people re-mortgaging their houses, selling their cars, asking for a loan from family and friends and more...  Hope this helps .. 
@_date: 2017-09-22 13:22:00
What else is left :)
@_date: 2017-09-13 18:07:37
As a business, when you charge a customer in bitcoin, the API allows for exchange at the most possible current rate. Or you can update manually. Currently only small amount of your sales will be coming through BTC based sales since most people prefer hodling.
As a business owner, you will still have the same amount of the bitcoin as long as you keep your BTCs. Therefore, the up and downs for BTC will not affect your income as long as you keep your BTCs. It will be under your decision when to convert your BTC to $$.
Once and if BTC goes mainstream, the up and downs will slow down - no different than $$$. 
@_date: 2017-09-23 03:46:41
If it goes back to 500 from almost 5000, trust me it will be zero very quickly!
@_date: 2017-09-23 04:17:27
Search for keyword “November” in “Bitcoin”sub and see how many results with different topics you get :)

We might see another drop with the possibility of China banning miners. We have a long way before reaching 5k. Hang in there and hodl.
@_date: 2017-09-28 21:03:14
I agree.
@_date: 2017-09-23 05:08:45
They are the real hodlers :)
@_date: 2017-09-08 14:13:29
Very smart of you! 
@_date: 2017-09-23 04:45:26
I know why you don’t care and you know why I care.
@_date: 2017-09-28 20:59:03
Fridays are always exciting! I thought we might see some sharp moves starting tomorrow.
@_date: 2017-09-23 03:29:08
This is a very true statement!
@_date: 2017-09-24 23:14:05
4900 to 3500 after the FUD. Sure Charlie, I believe in your analysis.
@_date: 2017-09-20 05:18:32
I honestly think that in the long term BTC would benefit if China bans miners, gets out of the picture once for all. However, in the short term, BTC would crash very hard because most of the active miners are in China. We will see, right.
@_date: 2018-03-02 18:56:56
Fuck him! His internet explorer caused a lot of deaths since 90s.

Your btc might become btg only without replay protection.  No double dipping.
@_date: 2017-09-23 06:20:25
More customers, more sales, more $$$. This is the reason why business accept credit cards, paypal, etc in addition to cash. 
@_date: 2017-09-23 05:21:59
Please tell me you actually google translated the english version that you wrote to Chinese first and posted backwords here.
@_date: 2017-09-23 21:12:21
I wish it worked simple like that. I really do. Look at last two weeks, btc was almost touching 5k but china and some smart people came in and cleaned up with by 1/3. Some people went all in before getting close to 5k, now will have to hold for a long time.  
@_date: 2017-09-13 18:22:21
Your mistake was to buy BTC on credit, but this is understandable since it was very appealing couple of days ago. You would be making another mistake if you sell it now and accept your losses. 
Try to cover your credit by cutting your other expenses and hold on to your BTC until the time you feel like selling. Again, people here simply trying to tell you that you should not be investing on credit even though it is appealing. Credit card companies would not give you credit if they were sure 100% that BTC would make them richer. 
@_date: 2017-09-22 13:23:08
and I promised China that I will tweet about my meeting. 
@_date: 2017-09-23 06:00:54
I feel for you, hang in there and keep hodling - wishing for the best!
@_date: 2017-09-08 13:41:13
Time to HODL - BUY! I was waiting for this, just bought another coin. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 20:40:10
I like this!
@_date: 2017-09-23 06:44:01
Calm down you freak. Revolution has nothing to do with putting all of you money in something that is still developing. I want btc to succeed as well but people need to be careful. Thats all I am saying.
@_date: 2017-09-08 13:59:22
Maybe we went too fast, still dropping:)
@_date: 2017-09-28 20:58:01
China will close down its operations by Sept. 30 as Chinese authorities crack down on cryptocurrencies. I think we will see some positive or negative moves starting tomorrow.
@_date: 2017-10-17 03:05:38
This! I think OP is here just to bitch! Kraken offered help above, he screams back fuck this fuck that. People are trying to help, finds excuses. He is willing to risk 2000 but cannot afford 25. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:13:14
The only reason he is badmouthing crytpo is because he does not like money from stocks flowing into crypto. There is no other reason. Yes, fuck him. 
@_date: 2017-09-23 05:44:19
Did not even try :)
@_date: 2017-09-28 21:45:41
I totally agree! Excited for both up and down!
@_date: 2017-09-23 03:27:32
What is the breaking news here? Everybody in this sub has bern aware of this - see btc prices for reference.
@_date: 2017-09-28 20:37:06
Both or either?
@_date: 2017-09-23 03:38:56
If you bought btc, no matter what people say, you will check prices, this is completely normal. There is no way i am putting some $$ for investment and not check what is going on for a month. I dont believe there is anyone with bitcoin not checking prices daily/hourly.
@_date: 2018-02-06 13:46:15
Buffet lost billions in stocks during last three days. E is already being fucked.
@_date: 2017-09-26 02:37:09
Currently, there is a certain number of btc holders with certain amount of buying power. Buying coffee with btc instead of $ creates exposure and movement. Other people see, and hear about it, they ask about it, they get involved and they also buy as well. If everyone holds it, the value diminishes. Think gold, nobody uses them in transactions, only holders.
Regardless of what you are paying with, you are paying the same amount of money (in $$) so you are not losing any value. 
@_date: 2017-09-23 03:30:53
We were on a break!! (Reference from friends)
@_date: 2017-09-23 03:40:35
People with BTC are trying too hard today! Now fake tweets. Mods, please...
@_date: 2017-09-23 21:05:27
“Moon”, “huge wealth”, “pussy”: typical words for typical stupid. Your  reading comprehension needs improvement too. Read one more time what I am trying to say in the original post. Invest what you can afford to loose. Why is it hard for you to get it? Why are you trying to get people to put ALL IN? Ohh we know why. Anyway, I am a btc buyer/holder, just a careful one. Best wishes. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 18:09:15
We are not alone :) hodl, It will get better soon. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 12:55:08
Yes, eliminating the going back and forth part would make this a wonderful application!
@_date: 2017-09-23 04:33:01
Sure genius! The more you are in, the more desperate posts you send like the one above in order to get more people to buy to increase the value of btc.

@_date: 2017-09-20 05:13:52
Yes, you are right. Today we received lots of unofficial news posts here regarding this ban. I think this why the BTC slowly going down ...
@_date: 2017-09-20 04:45:29
Tough days are waiting for bitcoin. There is also a possibility of China banning miners as well. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 19:23:31

Download blockfolio app and enter your coin valued manually. Prices will not be exact, but you can check at anytime without risk of opening your wallet. 
@_date: 2019-05-18 09:19:31
Can you please explain how can someone buy his own coins at a cheaper price?
@_date: 2019-05-15 03:56:57
Yes this guy is awesome!
