At some point, I expect facebook to nosedive in the same way MySpace did.  I haven't used facebook in over 2 years.

Already getting bitcoin related spam.  Won't be long until every other spammer picks it up.  Unfortunately it appears one of my email accounts was a throwaway, and the other was my "shopping" email account....

I've seen many videos of various people predicting that gold and silver trade would be heavily restricted as we near a collapse of the dollar.  If I didn't just lose my fill-time revenue stream, I would buy more, but unfortunately i need liquidity.
I trade silver coins (junk U.S. silver coins mostly) periodically, so this could affect me. 
EDIT: I just skimmed over the article.  I might be misinterpreting this (been drinking a little) but it appears that this legislation forces companies to deliver within 28 days.

My theory is that it was either perpetuated by a bank or a government....  it was inevitable that the bitcoin community would come under attack sooner or later. My guess is we'll see another major attack within the next week.

And they (presumably it is TradeHill) have been spamming my inbox using the hacked MtGox database of emails.

Not to sound too much of a conspiracy theorist, but anyone think this is a move by either the government or banks?  First it was the $500k news last week, and now this.

I'm actually trying to sell some BTC that I mined about 2 years ago, but I might take a similar route.
@_date: 2013-04-09 16:12:55
Yea, I saw there were a lot of sites, I just wasn't sure what was safe, reliable, etc - since I've only superficially watched bitcoin the last 2 years.

What's your recommendations, specifically for sale in US / USD?

After the security problems and email leak, I haven't touched MtGox since.  Admittedly, I haven't been active, but the first thing I did upon coming back was ask for what the latest/best exchanges were.
Ended up selling several bitcoin at around $260-per right before the crash.

or collateral.

You are correct.
"Crime" is an abstracted concept which describes a collection of behaviors, typically where one person initiates some form of harm or violation against another.
What would be more technically correct is to say "Money laundering has no victim, therefore I do not consider money laundering a crime."

I'm afraid bitfloor has it. :/

If there is a crime in this scenario (using Throwahoymatie's definition), it would not be the money laundering.
Assisting a known criminal in relation to the crime might potentially be considered criminal actions.  For example a bank-robbery getaway driver may not have physically stolen the money, however he was complicit in the activity of stealing the money.
