I'd like to have transferable tokens that are backed and redeemable for cash from the government. Being able to use say a USD backed token in the same way you can use bitcoin now would open up a whole new world of possibilities like decentralised exchanges that get around the problem of having a centralised fiat gateway.
Not that I think this is likely anytime soon, but it would be nice to have in addition to bitcoin and other currencies.

How about the blockchain evidence that lines up perfectly with those chats? Ross was in control of those coins.

@_date: 2015-06-04 15:30:43
I think the only way we get close to that is if there's some sort of token that is backed by actual fiat. You'd still have to trust the token issuer though so ideally something like the US government would be the one issuing a USD cryptocurrency that's redeemable at banks and such. With something like that we could use it on real decentralised exchanges like InstantDEX.
Highly doubt we're going to see any thing like that by the US government anytime soon. So we'd have to trust private companies issuing USD tokens, which isn't great and doesn't really get us much more decentralised than what we have now.

Only a very small percentage of early adopters are long term holders. Bitcoin was just a toy for a long time. Things started getting serious when it hit USD parity. But even then, for a long time anyone who would have predicted that BTC would go over $1000 or even $100 any time soon would have been met with much eye rolling.
Even getting back in to the teens after crashing from $32 to $2 was kind of a big deal.

I don't think there are *that* many people who think Bitcoin has much of a chance in the consumer payments niche. Even Bitpay has pivoted away from that model. Between the stable local currency part like you mention and other instruments like credit cards offering a ton of benefits for consumers, it's just not a market that people should be focusing on at all imo.

If the stress test is just sending a bunch of transactions below the minimum fee, is it really a good stress test? It's not worthless, it tests that specific type of congestion.

On topic though, it's pretty clear to me that Bitcoin's future in its current form is not consumer payments. I feel a lot of energy has been wasted on the persuit of this niche where the competitors clearly offer superior alternatives already.
The sooner everyone moves on from that dream the better imo. There's still lots of potential for Bitcoin, but it's just not built for retail.

I'd imagine they still have to pay taxes in Finland so they probably have a business account that they use for fiat. Plus their domain can be seized which would be detrimental to their business. They would still be able register new domains like the Pirate Bay does though.
If they were willing to operate somewhere else that's a little more disconnected from the west like BTC-e does, then they might be ok. 
But as soon as they start to have trouble with the US gov I'd predict they would do the same thing that they've done to German customers, block access based on geolocation.

@_date: 2015-06-04 15:49:42
Yes I understand that. I'm saying that there's no known way to deal with fiat in a decentralised manner, but the closest we could ever get is a token issued and backed by a country such as the US that controls its own currency. Otherwise having fiat representing crypto tokens backed by some third party doesn't really change much about the situation we have now where we need to trust an exchange to hold our money. 
A middle ground might be something like a large bank or other high market cap company issuing tokens backed by fiat though. Not as good as a government backed tokens, but much better than us trusting a handful of relatively small exchanges with little to no accountability.

Take a look at what has happened to the online gambling industry for US customers for a taste of their power. Not one single company is or was located in the US, but all but a few ballsy companies do not offer their services to anyone with a US IP. They can seize many different types of domains, including .com. And now gambling companies also actively do KYC/AML stuff, so it's quite difficult for a US person to participate even if they really wanted to via VPN or similar.
Some states have some legalized alternatives I think. But all the major players worldwide have been shut out of the US since last decade. The US really does have international reach it seems.
This is actually one of the areas that Bitcoin could really gain some market share in though. So there's a positive side for us. There's probably lots of Americans who would love to be able to gamble again and Bitcoin is one of the only realistic ways they can do that as far as I can tell.

What do you mean they failed to produce evidence that it happened? They presented the chat logs and the correlated transactions on the blockchain for hundreds of thousands of dollars.
In this case that evidence gets rolled in to the 'continuing criminal enterprise' charge and the judge must consider things like that when deciding the sentencing. And she mentioned that she had no doubt it was Ross who commissioned the murders. The CCE charge is informally known as 'The Kingpin Statute'. Check out this: 
Life is too harsh for Ross imo, but being charged with that is no joke. There are even guidelines for the death penalty there.

I think it's a very poor choice of words to call such a thing an altcoin, considering the community has used that term to refer to separate blockchains with their own genesis block since 2011.

I wasn't aware that Feathercoin forked off from Litcoin's blockchain. That doesn't make a lot of sense to me considering Feathercoin has faster blocks and a different coin emission schedule.
Not to mention Litecoin had a bit of a fast mine at the start and doesn't exactly have the best distribution. I'd be pretty shocked if they actually forked off from the established Litecoin chain. Not saying it's not true but I think it would only make sense if a bunch of Litecoin whales got together back then and decided they wanted to try double their money by doing this.

That's the legal concept yeah, but on a personal level one can look at the evidence and make their own conclusion.


If the evidence is presented and the jury finds someone guilty of this specific charge then it seems the law allows the judge to consider the evidence and sentence based on what they are convinced happened. The judge said during sentencing that she was certain that Ross ordered the murders, and I guess given that she chose the sentence based on these guidelines:  
I think it would been better if they had included the murder charges though, but it seems they use this law as a sort of catch all for people that are able to get charged with it. 
I do think life is too harsh in this case. Although it also sounds like she could have given him the death penalty according to the law there, not sure.

Personally I'm super bearish on Bitcoin as a consumer payments technology. I think it has virtually no chance in that arena. 
That being said, for the merchant the fact that payments in bitcoin cannot be charged back offers some amount of value. How much value is going to depend on a lot of different factors like what type of business it is. Also, theoretically accepting bitcoin for payment could cost less compared to something like credit cards depending on what sort of fee structure they have with their payment processor. I say theoretically because there's a lot of hidden cost with accepting bitcoin in many forms such as time and hassle. It really depends on many factors. For example if Walmart decided to accept bitcoin the training, handling, accounting, legal requirements ect costs would amount to many millions of dollars almost certainly. But for a Bitcoin enthusiast who runs their own store and already knows how to use and store Bitcoin, or is already set up through something like Bitpay, the costs can sometimes be minimal.
@_date: 2015-06-22 11:05:58

Good post, but I think you're really overestimating the power of the Chinese miners. It's the American companies like Coinbase and Circle who really have the most sway imo.

And they will be forced to mine on the chain with the highest demand to maximize their profits.
@_date: 2015-06-04 20:01:05
The logs were stored locally on the laptop. And since it was Ross' personal encrypted computer the idea that someone else could have been posing as DPR in chats as well as having control of the private keys to that 9 figure USD bitcoin stash seems pretty far fetched. Also there's no mention of him handing over SR in his diary or the logs and you would think that handing over what was on track to be a billion dollar operation might have been mentioned at least once.
The only plausible idea that I've heard is that the government faked the chats somehow. But that would imply a massive conspiracy on multiple levels. And doesn't explain the bitcoin transactions.

Many people are afraid that Bitcoin will be caught with its pants down with only 1MB blocks should another high demand bubble period set in.

Eh, considering how much gets burned on mining everyday it's kind of hard to argue against this point in particular. Decentralisation comes at a cost.

Surprised that more people don't talk about this possibility. A superior currency could use sidechaining to bootstrap itself to a point where it no longer benefits from being pegged to Bitcoin and then fork off intending to surpass Bitcoin. Almost like a Trojan Horse(in the classical sense, not malware).
I don't mean to imply that sidechains are bad or anything, I actually find the idea that this could happen really exciting because I have zero faith in Bitcoin itself evolving from a technical perspective(with that view being solidified now during the past couple months). If this is the best chance for cryptocurrency evolution then I'm all for it.

I thought I learned on here that many companies can get a far better rate than 3%. And the user of course doesn't pay those fees. If anything they get a nice amount of points or cash back rewards depending on their card.
And the theft thing is a bit silly considering as a consumer you're fully insured against theft/fraud. One phone call and a signature gets that sorted out. 
I feel like this sub had sort of accepted the fact that Bitcoin alone wasn't going to take over the consumer payments world a few months ago. Now with all the blocksize drama we're starting to get a lot of 2013esque 'Bitcoin is the next Visa' ideas again it seems.

If they admitted that Ross started SR, and we know that he has been recording everything in his journal, and if he supposedly handed over SR to another DPR, why would there be no mention or indication of this at all?
What are they even implying exactly? That another DPR was the person using his own personal laptop and that they were the one who ordered all the hits?
If another person was supposedly DPR(Mark Karpeles? LOL), did Ross hand off SR's nine figure USD bitcoin wallet? Was it sent to someone else at some point? Wouldn't they point that out?
Why were the chat logs and interpersonal relationships with people involved with SR so consistent over time? How could something as large as the passing of something on track to be a billion dollar operation have not a single discussion or mention?
Why did things recorded in Ross' journal line up with things happening in his life?

You can't actually be serious with this post...
Out of everything you listed the only advantage that Bitcoin offers for people is the p2p microtransaction aspect. But that's just moving the goal posts anyway since that's not typically considered a consumer related service. Many countries banking banking systems offer free instant p2p transactions anyway. Not sure if many of them would let people send 10 cents though, there might be a small minimum. But it's irrelevant anyway. Bitcoin's value comes from it's decentralisation.
I'm quite confident that most of the sane people on this sub would agree with me that credit cards in general offer a superior experience for consumers right now in 2015.

I know that they understand what's happening, but to call alternative implementations of the Bitcoin protocol that are intended to continue the actual Bitcoin blockchain altcoins is a poor choice of words. Yes, in a vacuum calling such a thing an altcoin sounds reasonable, but considering we've been using the term altcoin to describe chains with an entirely separate genesis block since 2011, it only serves to confuse people who won't be able to immediately make the distinction. And that's a lot of users, as we can already see how many people seem to be confused in this thread alone.

I remember reading the judges letter she wrote regarding that and she said that the defense didn't do enough to convince her that they were experts in their fields. Personally I would have preferred that they were allowed to testify as I'm curious about what the defense had in mind there. Not sure what they could have possibly said through regarding Bitcoin that would change anything. Maybe they would have spoke about the misconception that Bitcoin is anonymous? That's all I can think of off the top of my head.
In this case though the logs on Ross' computer wasn't online information free to change, and you can't change the Bitcoin blockchain either.

But I'd also caution against using such provocative imagery if Greece isn't in that sort of cultural mindset, as it could do more harm than good by associating Bitcoin with an ideology that many people might reject.
Also, I know it's originally a flower bouquet in the picture. If anything it might be better to keep the flowers and place the Bitcoin logo elsewhere.

Anyway you measure it, it's the same. Adding units smaller than satoshis doesn't change the absolute value. If every single wallet stopped measuring in BTC and started to use bits instead, nothing would change.
If someone were to make it so that instead of the block reward halving next year, it stayed at 25 BTC for the next 20 years, that would be adding and increasing the supply.

I don't necessarily support Gavin's ideas, but calling BitcoinXT an altcoin seems like they don't understand what it is.
New rhetoric proclaiming that any other implementation of the Bitcoin protocol other than Bitcoin Core that's intended to be used on the Bitcoin blockchain is an altcoin is *really bad*. 
Whether or not we ever fork to a separate implementation is irrelevant. But having people create and maintain alternative *Bitcoin* implementations like Conformal does with btcd is actually a good thing for decentralisation.

It wasn't just "for coding". The biggest charge was the continuing criminal enterprise charge which when sentenced takes in to consideration the murders for hire that were presented as evidence in the trial.

True. And every one is absolutely sure of the fact that the 21 million BTC or the coin emission schedule will never be changed under any circumstances. But really that's only a projection of their own wishes. Many things could happen in the future. One possible example is if the block reward gets low enough that miners start shutting off and the network weakens, the idea that something like a flat 1% coin emission to incentivize mining is something that could actually happen. Lots of people will be outraged at the idea of  course, but if the economic majority supports the change then it's going to happen.

I think if the US really wanted to kill Bitcoin they would make a secret deal with China for the PRC government to go in and secure control of all the mining pools/farms. Gag or imprison all the workers so they can't warn anyone of what's happening until its too late.

Litecoin has potential but I'm under the impression that the community is happy with the state of the project and have no plans to innovate on top of it. I thought there was a quote floating around from someone influential within Litecoin saying something a long the lines of "Litecoin is a finished project".

The thing is too that by my back of the envelope calculation, if the financial services industry decides to use coloured coins or something similar on top of Bitcoin, the amount of demand directly generated by  that is minimal. If transactions only cost a few cents each it would take a very large amount of these transactions to really make any sort of non marginal difference in demand. And we already know that Bitcoin isn't suited for any type of highspeed trading or anything, and it's more of a settlement network/ledger. So even millions of transactions of coloured coins amounts to less BTC than is even produced in one day from mining inflation.

Creating jobs isn't the primary goal though, it's supposed to be a result of stimulating the economy. QE worked well enough to get the US out of recession and back on track in terms of GDP growth. So the Fed does its job, but I don't think creating jobs is in their mandate. That's up to the politicians to enact policy that makes sure that economic growth gets spread out more.
Everyone here loves to shit on the Fed, but from what I can tell it's one of the only establishments that seem to do a decent job with meeting its goals. There is so much wrong in the US government that I feel people are wasting their discontent on the parts that actually work instead of the parts that don't, like congress.

Politics of Bitcoin is the main reason I think alts in general have a much better than zero chance of making a dent in Bitcoin's market cap.
Ideally the total crypto market cap would just grow and every good technology would just share in the gains from increased market share. But in reality it looks like the market will have more internal competition than it seemed like in 2013(pretty much zero chance then).

I wish we could just drop this conspiracy theory already. In my opinion(and I'm sure I'm not alone here), after reading his posts for years, it would be totally out of character for gmaxwell to be secretly plotting to keep block sizes small for his own personal gain. It's a pretty ridiculous accusation really.
The other members of Blockstream haven't been as publicly active as he has over the years, so I can't say I have a particularly strong read on any of them. But I'm also pretty sure that he wouldn't associate with a group of people that were intending to manipulate Bitcoin in this way.
His opinions are just that, without some hidden agenda. Not to mention nothing about Bitcoin having bigger blocks makes any of the main features that sidechains are likely to provide any less important. Sidechains were supposed to give Bitcoin users access to all the features that alts provide like anonymity/privacy, faster transactions, smart contracts, decentralised asset exchanges and such. Nothing about the blocksize has any bearing on the potential utility of sidechains.

Okay, but as far as identifying as libertarian or similar philosophy Europe in general is pretty far left. People like to say that the American left is closer to the European right.
Also, just because they hate the Euro doesn't necessarily mean they hate fiat overall. From what I've seen a lot of the anti-Euro sentiment is from people who wish to have their old local currency back, not abolish it all together.
Either way, personally I don't see Bitcoin as a 'bitcoin vs fiat' thing and I don't really think they're really directly comparable or incompatible. Gold is a better comparison imo.

Bitcoin is absolutely not banned in Thailand. And Thailand isn't 'poverty stricken', unless you think people living outside of what some might consider 'western standards' is living in poverty. 
There are *some* people in poverty obviously, as there are in almost every country in the world. But it's also a country that has less than one percent unemployment and functions much closer to what many people might consider capitalism for regular people. I.e. no one's stopping you from making a comfortable living by selling something on the street, or walking around and providing a service for people, unlike tightly regulated western nations. 
Few countries exist where I'd be confident to say that if someone is able bodied and poor they're probably just lazy, but Thailand is one of those. I wouldn't even begin to think that for a western nation.

It's just the US mostly which oddly lags technically in some important areas like banking and internet service. It's weird from a foreign perspective to see the US so far head in certain things while often so behind in other basic areas. I assume it's just political bs holding certain areas back, since obviously it's not a lack of technology.

Redandwhite told Ross that Tony76 had 3 roommates and Ross was apparently fine with them all being killed so he could get to Tony. And Tony wasn't blackmailing anyone. He was just a thief.
So even if you say FrendlyChemist wasn't innocent, or Tony, there's still those 3 roommates.

So when everyone says 'why use a blockchain, what they need is a database', HyperLedger is trying to provide that database tech and protocol in which multiple participants can form a consensus.
I guess it's easy to say 'all you need is a database!', but someone still has to go out an design that system to be used. Maybe it will be like Git, but for finance.
The fact that they're not trying to be 'blockchain technology' actually makes them seem a bit more legitimate in my mind, lol.

If you think about it, it's probably inevitable that something like that will happen. Maybe not in the next 5 years, but considering how difficult Bitcoin is to change and the type of advancements we might see 10, 20, even 30 years down the road, it seems like the most plausible exit plan for Bitcoin.
It could be a situation where people are able to burn their Bitcoin in exchange for the new alt over a period of time too, so anyone who chooses to won't lose any value.
It will probably be pretty obvious at some point if some sidechain is where the vast majority of economic activity is and Bitcoin was stagnating. I don't think there's much to worry about waking up one day with a big surprise message that you have to move all your BTC holdings on to this newly detached former sidechain. The signs will probably be there well in advance.

I'm not sure, but from what I understand NXT has transparent forging where it's already determined who is going to forge the next block. Would it be possible just to hold off your trade until you can see that the next block will be forged by an address known to play fair with market orders? Which is probably &gt;99% (if not 100%) of them for now, but that's just a guess and in the future if things continue to grow I don't discount the possibility of some bad actors attempting to exploit in that manner.
Their economic clustering thing might also be something that can mitigate exploits like that in some way, but their PoS system seems quite a bit different than the standard older style that I don't fully understand how it works yet. Maybe someone here who knows more about it can comment.
I feel like decentalised exchanges are going to be one of the most important aspects of the crypto economy in the future, so I think it's really important that something like this is mitigated. My initial feelings are that even if it's not a completely solved problem, it won't be bad enough to completely overshadow the value of decentralised exchanges, but I could be wrong on that.
What about Ethereum too? Anyone knowledgeable about how they plan to deal with such issues?

Some people were. There were still a lot of people who were interested in Bitcoin and thought that it would grow over time, but not explode like it did. Also, statists and anti-statists alike sold way early or never bought significant amounts. Amir sold a bunch of coins around $10 or something. Really the opinion that BTC was going to be worth over $100 shortly was much less common than you're making it out to be. Especially after witnessing the $32 to $2 bubble it was extremely easy to justify a sell off during a big surge.

If more than one DPR existed, why are all the logs on Ross' computer as well as events that correspond to things happening in Ross' life at the time? How could he log everything, but leave zero indication that this ever happened? Why would all the financial dealings come from the bitcoins he was controlling? Why did he order multiple fake IDs with Ross' face on them if it was another person? How did this other person live a life that mirrors Ross' life?
People saying that the logs were faked probably have a stronger argument imo, although both have a probability that's virtually zero for all intents and purposes.

$100 was pretty wild. Definitely didn't expect that to happen so quickly.
Lots of people in this sub had just gotten rich and were throwing money around like crazy. Largest tip I saw was worth $5000 at the time.
The ultra high numbers don't really make a lot of sense considering the demand needed to offset the monetary base inflation via mining. At least in the short term anyway. After a few halvings either the network will become a lot weaker from lowered incentive to mine, or the price will be high enough that mining 3.125 BTC per block still equals a similar amount of value to when the block reward was double that. It's possible, not sure how likely it is but it will be interesting to see how it works out. 
Lots of big question marks for the future, as I doubt fees will be sufficient. Meaning the price of BTC really *has* to go up quite a bit or else the security of the blockchain will decay. Which isn't exactly an attractive proposition for investors.

You don't see the value in being able to buy crypto tokens at somewhere like a bank that are backed by USD? It would solve virtually every non protocol related problem we have with Bitcoin now. You wouldn't need Coinbase, Circle, or anything like that. You could simply buy the USD tokens and exchange them for BTC on a truly decentralised exchange. It would eliminate the need for middle men. Right now any time you get in or out of BTC you're trusting both the middle man and implicitly the government(by using their fiat). By having what is effectively cash in crypto token format you get direct access to Bitcoin without having to trust anyone but the government you already implicitly trust(or have no alternative at least) by using their fiat.
It doesn't have to be a blockchain or anything, but ideally it would be work in a similar way to Bitcoin where only you control the private keys and the ledger is immutable(has to be, otherwise its useless). It would be centralised digital cash which would be a huge boon to Bitcoin access by making it more accessible.
I don't expect something like this to happen anytime soon(if ever), but it would be great. No more Goxing or centralised exchanges necessary. 
They'll probably do something like this at some point, but make it shitty somehow and not useful. But if it was done right it would be good.

Is it cheaper though? I'd imagine that during a high demand period spreads on BTC in Greece might go very high. I remember seeing some absolutely insanely expensive BTC for sale in Argentina a little while back.
If Greeks have a good cheap way to buy BTC then that's good though.

Can't imagine a foreigner waltzing in to a country that likely has regulations and placing a bunch of ATMs is going to go over well.

Finding a Greek citizen to partner with would probably be a less risky alternative too.

Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if they did actually have the resources to track every individual selling BTC publicly in the US. How many people could there really be at this point? 1000?
Plus just because they track public sellers doesn't mean they necessarily audit each one.
The warning signs have been clear as day for a little while now. The federal government is absolutely targeting Bitcoin sellers who aren't registered MSBs. This is the first I've heard specifically of the IRS being involved, but it's not surprising. And I would never underestimate the IRS personally.

Yes, as I said in my post I don't think Bitcoin has any chance of success in consumer payments. Credit cards are vastly superior for consumers as I've mentioned on here many times over the years.
The theoretical value of not having charge backs would come from some industry that as a high enough rate of credit card fraud that it impacts their bottom line in a significant way. Perhaps something like selling Steam keys, or something similar that the company can't get back once they're redeemed. I don't know, it would be a very specific niche that could potentially benefit from Bitcoin in this respect.

The only solution to that that I can think of is changing the algorithm on a fixed schedule with some sort of random attributes that can be generated. Like once a year the algorithm changes and the developers run a provably fair random number generator that modifies the algorithm in such a way that the ASIC manufacturers have to design new chips based on these new specifications. Finding a wide enough range of properties for the algorithm and an time interval frequent enough for algorithm change could make it so that it's not profitable to fabricate ASICs for mining any longer. Leaving general purpose CPUs and GPUs with the advantage of being able to mine the algorithms.
Now that might not make sense on a technical level for a few different reasons like there not really being too many properties that you can just randomly assign in that way. Or it simply being too risky to change algorithms that way. I don't know, it's just a thought.
Another option would be just to have a set of algorithms that can be used, and choose one of those at random at whatever interval disincentivizes chip fabbing again just like the first option. You could have say 15 algorithms from a pool, say ones that were analyzed by NIST for their SHA3 competition. The downside to this is that its possible people could just create 15 different ASICs, one for every possible choice. Not sure how practical that would be, but over a long enough time we could probably expect that to happen. But in that case older algorithms could always be removed from the pool and replaced by new ones.
We know that there's no such thing as an ASIC proof algorithm, but reaching some sort of equilibrium between Bitcoin and ASIC makers where it's not profitable for them to make them could help decentralise Bitcoin.
It wouldn't be a 100% fix since along with economies of scale with ASICs the other centralising force is cheap power, which is localized in only a few specific areas where government subsidies allow usage at a fraction of the cost of standard electricity. It could help re-decentalise Bitcoin quite a bit though if it was possible.

If more than one DPR existed, why are all the logs on Ross' computer as well as events that correspond to things happening in Ross' life at the time? How could he log everything, but leave zero indication that this ever happened? Why would all the financial dealings come from the bitcoins he was controlling? Why did he order multiple fake IDs with Ross' face on them if it was another person? How did this other person live a life that mirrors Ross' life?
People saying that the logs were faked probably have a stronger argument imo, although both have a probability that's virtually zero for all intents and purposes.

I don't think the person who wrote that CNN article realizes that there are two separate indictments. The NY prosecutors can't drop the Maryland charges just like that.
The five murder for hire charges get considered under the continuing criminal enterprise charge, which is why they presented that evidence and why the judge gave such a harsh sentence(too harsh imo).
I doubt they'll end up trying him in Maryland, but it would be better if they do.

This is the latest in a history of misleading people about the nature of Bitcoin. 
For a long time back in 2011 Bitcoin was often sold as being anonymous too.
It was also often presented as an amazing system for micropayments. Which it of course is not. That point was really driven home to me when at one point it was costing me ~25 cents per transaction using Electrum. Then I had to manually go in the Electrum code just to set the fee down to the so called minimum of 0.0001, which was still around 12-13 cents at one point.

I don't really have a side here, but this is interesting. Hadn't really thought about the fact that a big part of this debate is actually about catering to China's needs. And that you're probably right about the market adapting to whatever the conditions end up being.
China does have something like like 60% of the hashrate though, so if we're forced to cater to their needs perhaps we should be thinking of doing the opposite and finding ways to help promote the decentralisation of mining.

I'm not a fan of Litecoin, but if people actually started using it and the investors and infrastructure could make money off it, they probably will.
Unlike the truly innovative alt cryptos that have built everything from scratch, Litecoin has the one advantage that it's completely backwards compatible with Bitcoin. So the amount of effort it takes to use and integrate Litecoin is minimal.
If people do choose to move over to another crypto, I do hope they choose something better than Litecoin though.

I don't think calling the Lead Developer of Bitcoin Core's opinions 'FUD' is very productive personally. 
I really dislike the term 'FUD' as it's something I see scammy altcoins constantly use as defense when someone is criticizing them, and they want to just deflect it without addressing any of the issues.
Funnily enough, it was Gavin who brought usage of the term 'FUD' in to Bitcoin if I remember correctly.

In places like Zimbabwe it's quite bad as everyone knows, but in the US it's pretty transparent that there is a target inflation rate and the real inflation rate is not a secret. I don't see how that's fundamentally dishonest, the fact that the dollar is meant to inflate at a small rate over time is common knowledge and a stated goal. It's not like the government forces you to keep all of your money in non interest bearing accounts. One of the main points of targeted inflation is to incentivize investment as opposed to just holding money.

Except that there seem to be multiple companies attempting to deliver a blockchain-without-bitcoin product to all these people jumping on the 'blockchain technology' bandwagon.

Well so far there hasn't been anything worse than the Great Depression. Of course anything could happen in the future, but most economists would like to think that it's much easier to avoid that type of outcome with the knowledge and tools that are available today. Some probably think that their actions in the 2008 crisis directly prevented it from reaching depression levels.

They do an execellent job of maintaining Bitcoin and adding minor improvements. But Bitcoin itself is never going to be on the cutting edge of cryptocurrency technology.

Mining tends towards centralisation in general. The large farm operations have pushed out many people who can't complete with them.
Sure if BTC shot up to 10k right now lots of people would be turning on their machines that are currently obsolete. But the more efficient miners will always push out marginal miners over time. 
But for a perfect example of how mining tends towards centralistion, we can look at that new super chip KnC developed that they aren't selling to the public. They'll continue to be a major player for a while with their new tech and geographically advantageous position.
A lot of the biggest miners now aren't even pools, but actual mega farms. Two of the biggest miners now are showing as operating separately on the pie chart, but actually share the exact same location in China. Split it up like that and it looks better. Not to mention how much 'unknown' has grown over the years. Mining Sybil attacks are trivial and we'll never really know how much hash power is really under the control of a single party.

Extensive changes. Monero and BBR use ring signatures for anonymous transactions. NXT has a fully PoS system with zero inflation and a decentralised asset exchange among other things. Bitshares has bitassets like BitUSD that are supposed to be pegged to whatever they represent and they invented delegated PoS. Ethereum has all kinds of crazy things going on like 12 second blocks with an innovative way to do that and all kinds of smart contract crap as well. NEM invented PoI or proof of importance which I know nothing about other than it's supposed to measure each node's contribution to the network or something. 
Much more than that too. There's tons of great projects out there with lots of good developers and smart people building new technology. None of these things are based off of Bitcoin in anyway other than the fact that they are cryptocurrencies that use blockchains.

See, the problem is that for regular people, they come across one of these Bitcoin ATMs and get greeted by those high fees. Or their friend tells them about how they felt like it was a rip off. None of these people are going to be purchasing BTC on Bitfinex any time soon.
People have been saying for what seems like a couple of years now that competition will bring those ATM charges down substantially. But it doesn't really seem to be happening, and I've mentioned before that it's quite possible they're doing more harm than good by driving away more potential demand than they actually generate. That's not even considering some of the AML/KYC stuff that they apparently are forced to implement. No one likes that.

I don't think that many people really believe that Bitcoin is going to be replacing fiat currencies all over the world. So it 'working' is kind of hard to measure. I think some countries are seeing steadily increasing figures on sites like localbitcoins showing that there is growing interest in BTC in some places.

Well, there are lots of crazy things said on the internet. But this cases was quite specific in making threats against a US judge. It's not really that crazy that they would go after those people. 
We already know they would do the same thing if it were threats against the president. And probably congress as well. So not *too* surprising that the judiciary also receives similar treatment.

But I imagine it as a net economic gain personally. I see what you're saying, but I also think that if something came along that dethroned Bitcoin it would only happen if this new contender was filling a market need that Bitcoin couldn't handle. And by doing that the overall market would be expanded by this new technology meeting the demands of the expanded market.
It would only really happen if there truly was something that could really take crypto to a new height. I'd bet that almost everyone here would be able to see it for what it was if that ever happened. I'm certainly not talking about something like Litecoin taking over or anything. It would have to be something that really solved some problems. If Bitcoin stagnated technologically and there was real market demand out there for something that could handle the global economy, eventually something is likely to fill that need.

The early adopters are angry because they were always told it would be super easy to scale Bitcoin. And then yeah there seem to be a good amount of people who appear to have bought in late 2013/2014 at a much higher price and are underwater and they're waiting for another bubble to at least get themselves back to even. Not that they're all just going to sell, but there are a lot of unhappy people who aren't satisfied with the lack of growth and want to see results asap.

A big issue for ring sigs is that it's an even bigger issue for the scaling question. I doubt a blockchain that uses ring sigs could ever be the primary ledger. Probably more likely that there's some new public blockchain tech that's specifically made for scaling,  and then a secondary private chain that uses ring sigs for anonymity.

They raised a ton of USD from VCs, but haven't necessarily directly bought any bitcoin with the money.

By hold them back I mean value wise. Like people believe that their currency would do better as a free floating currency not pegged to the value of BTC. Say there was a robust PoS system in the future that the sidechain used and there was no need to rely on merge mining with BTC or something like that.
@_date: 2015-06-07 19:22:35
I'm not an expert on the tech, but it can vary according to how many mixins you choose to use on your transaction. Zero would be a transparent transaction that's probably of a similar size to a Bitcoin one, but I've also heard of one coin that uses a default of 24 mixins for their transactions, so I'd guess for that chain transactions are ~24 times bigger.
I know it weakens the whole anonymity of the chain when people do zero mixin transactions so I think most chains will eventually enforce a minimum of like 3 or something.
I think they have to have varied enforced minium fees that vary based on tx size too since spamming massive transactions with the maximum number of mixins is an obvious way to bloat the blockchain.

They have a responsibility to their pocketbook as well. And if they value the amount of money they make from mining it's in their best interest not to be going over 50% or even remotely close to that.

I'm not super concerned either, but I do think it's something that people should consider at least.
People spending all this generated wealth on all these new merchants that convert BTC to USD is another good point. I normally thought of it more as people buying BTC to spend the BTC at Dell or whatever and then Dell cashing it out to USD and the whole thing being a wash. But that's probably not the cast most of the time. And that explains the lack of enthusiasm shown by the market in the last couple of months with regards to all the big merchant adoptions.

Not really. When it comes down to it miners will follow whatever rules the economic majority decides are the right ones. They can mine on a different chain if they want, but we'll see how long they'll keep that up when their monthly power bill comes in.

It's still white collar crime. There's a whole world out there where they can enjoy their spoils. As soon as they can get the chance to legally leave the country, even if they owe millions in damages, why aren't they just going to live abroad indefinitely and not pay it back? They have millions in BTC to sustain them unfortuantely. If this were in dollars(and part of it is, so that's good) the government would have all the power. But in this case they're pretty powerless to get a hold of that money.
They could always waterboard them though. ;)

They're saying here though that the encryption itself is one where "virtually" the only way to decrypt it though is the users own key. Also, this applies to locally stored data and not icloud data so someone would need to access the local data on the phone and encrypt it.

Yes, that's bad in a different way. Both Bitcoin and credit cards are very poor for privacy. 
With Bitcoin my anyone can see how much I have in an address I've sent money from and also see what other addresses have been sent to as well. Multiple people in this thread have claimed privacy as a feature for Bitcoin and I feel that's misleading and certainly not a feature. 
Also, if I could spend Bitcoin anonymously by giving Coinbase or someone similar access to all of that information I would and I feel that it would be an improvement over the current situation. 
Perhaps the Bitcoin devs will implement anonymity in the future. This is very unlikely but one can hope.

The average cost of including each transaction in a block is $30 per transaction? Is this because of the fact that each additional transaction that's included in a block increases the probability of an orphan?

I can't imagine them giving any sort of insurance other than a token amount in case of loss. That is unless you paid for insurance based on a specific value that you claim the contents of your box are worth. Like if I said these envelopes are worth $100,000, they might offer to insure that value for some percentage of that perhaps.
Hopefully it's not actually worth insuring since it *should* be safe. You never know though, fire, theft(unlikely I'd guess since real life isn't like Ocean's 11), flood damage ect.

All these billionaires investing their dollars in bitcoin related companies, but not putting any apparent significant stake in bitcoin it's self.
I assume they see this as the less risky approach. It's interesting that we don't see many extremely high net worth individuals come out and endorse bitcoin by claiming they've bought $x million worth. Obviously some will have privacy concerns, but lots of them are public figures who's investments are followed anyway. It would seem to be in their best interest to publicly endorse bitcoin if they hold it, since that message is a positive one that will cause others to follow.
Maybe we'll see more of this in the future. It's a high risk, high reward investment. But the risk is minimal compared to the amount of money some of these people have.

Probably going to have to send that alt to another exchange to cash it back in to bitcoin if you want to play it safe.
Poloniex is a good one. Avoid Cryptsy imo.
BTC-e might work if you're doing this with LTC. But probably better to do it with something like Monero and Poloniex gets a lot of volume for Monero.

I remember when the foundation was created it was sold as "just a way to pay Gavin". Which would be fine if that's all it turned out to be. But that obviously hasn't been the case.

Luckily for us we have lots of choices as far as cryptocurrencies that provide privacy. We'll see how much the market actually cares based on the successes and failures of these alternatives.
Bitcoin hasn't had privacy as a mandate at all thus far anyway. That's why there are multiple coins and multiple implementations that now offer that as a primary feature. 
I only use bitcoin at the moment. But it's nice to know I have options.
@_date: 2014-12-26 19:25:36
I don't necessarily think that some our our current systems are inherently bad in theory, but what I think is important is giving people choice. Same way I can just switch my Electrum server. Sure, it's "centralised" but you're not locked in to anything and you're free to choose.

User base can grow but demand has to be created too. People need to be buying more than is supplied to the price to increase. We need to work on providing some actual value and genuinely good use cases to people.
@_date: 2015-06-26 11:16:33
Yeah, but 1997 had a lot to do with Thailand's massive over extension of credit and overbuilding leading to default. It was inevitable, just needed a trigger. 
Is there a similar situation going on now that could be triggered by this?
But in general Asia is in a much stronger economic situation than it was 20 years ago so probably a lot less likely for something like this to happen right now. I know there's a bunch of ghost towns in China and such, but nothing seems to have come out of that since real estate is one of the few things that Chinese can legally invest in.

Maybe we like to use BTC to buy stuff because we're all Bitcoin enthusiasts. But how to you get other people to use it as well if they end up spending more money than they would have otherwise using their credit card, or even cash(the spread buying BTC)?
Honest question, not meant to be an attack against Bitcoin. I use BTC daily. But these days I'm pretty tapped out in regards to how I can convince other people that it's worth using. "You control your own money" and "Freedom" seem to be non starters.

Yes. But as a whole Bitcoin is going to be used as a tool to extract information about people and their spending habits. We're already seeing that happen now with Coinbase.
An individual privacy enthusiast might be able to use tools that help protect their individual privacy, but overall Bitcoin is going to be a net-loss for privacy.

@_date: 2014-08-14 12:02:11
Yes, the market is incredibly over reactive. It's fueled by speculation of course. The mere whisper of a few million dollars in BTC being sold off and everyone sells in an attempt to buy back cheaper. It's just a big game and unfortunately the people who hope to one day have Bitcoin as a functioning currency that people can use on a daily basis are the ones who lose out.

Hmm, I can't really see it. Maybe I'm wrong but I'd guess his ideas to fix the financial system would be much different than bitcoin.

I've been discovering that the only thing that the vast, vast majority of bitcoiners care about is the price of bitcoin.

You're wrong. Adoption drives demand. As the Bitcoin economy grows the utility of Bitcoin grows as well. Having Bitcoin as nothing but a token that people save ends up being a game of greater fool.
Bitcoin is supposed to be a currency. Currencies get spent. If it's useful for people and adds value to their lives there will be demand. And demand drives price.

Just tell them that there's over $1 million worth of BTC created everyday and it's likely that most of that gets sold off on the markets. And it's difficult to sustain that much demand. 
That might not be the only reason it's down but it's a pretty legit explanation that people can probably understand. Just say the money supply is inflating at ~10% per year. Sustaining four figure prices takes many millions of dollars per day coming in.

12 seconds is *probably* low enough that you could effectively accept it at zero seconds and it will be confirmed before the customer has left the premises.
I'm trying to picture it in my head of someone going in to 7/11 buying some cigarettes and leaving and driving away in less than 12 seconds and I'm not really seeing it. Not to mention that no one would ever do an attack for such an amount. Unconfirmed transactions work fine here in a microtransaction sense I think.
So for probably 99% of transactions it should effectively be the same as a zero second confirmation. But for the 1% where a customer could abscond, waiting an average of 12 seconds seems very reasonable.
And for the really large transactions like buying a car or a house, of course both buyer and seller will understand the importance of waiting for n confirmations before closing the deal.
We can hope that Bitcoin will also be able to take advantage of these improvements in cryptocurrency technology over time too.

Thailand isn't really a huge remittance country compared to somewhere like the Philippines. 
Thailand has the lowest unemployment rate in the world last time I checked. Less than 1% if I remember correctly.

The innovation of the blockchain came long before Bitcoin itself. The decentralised Bitcoin blockchain is its own specific innovation but the immutable blockchain concept isn't something that inherently has to be decentralised I don't think. Centralised ledger itself isn't exactly the same as a distributed blockchain that can be independently verified. Even control of the blockchain itself is centralised.

That sounds alright in theory, but imagine the millions of dollars that it would cost to support such a feature and the headache of having people being hacked or scammed.
I just can't imagine there ever being enough incentive for them to implement something like this. Paypal maybe, as that's the business they're in anyway. But for any other type of company to implement a bitcoin wallet sounds like it would be much more trouble than its worth.

Well then there's an issue. If he didn't put in those years of work for free then we have a big problem. If he's planning on selling or even moving some of those BTC then Bitcoin is never going to be able to establish itself in capital markets. It's just too much of a risk.
FWIW I don't think Satoshi plans to do anything with his coins.

Kind of, but it really depends on how you look at it. If you're one of the people who are expecting Bitcoin to replace the financial system than maybe. But if you view Bitcoin as just another alternative option like gold is, then it's not really a bad thing if banks stored Bitcoin.
Personally I think it would really need to be considered an asset along side other commodities with financial services such as banks offering services in Bitcoin if it's really going to gain any sort of mainstream adoption. 
@_date: 2014-07-17 15:12:30

That's fine with me if that's how he chooses to frame it, i.e. "I was young and impressionable" ect. But he's just been choosing to ignore it thus far.
I just find the whole situation a bit strange. I'm not accusing him of anything specific, or even trying to imply he's done anything other than just make some really, really poor decisions. And I think the public would probably appreciate a little more disclosure considering the situation.
edit: According to Wikipedia he would have been 21 at the time he was arrested in Spain. So it would be a long time to mature and think over the type of people you would want to keep company with. Again, I'm not on some anti-Brock witchhunt, but I think if I were him I'd try to address that issue.

Bitcoin only becomes price deflationary if and only if demand outstrips supply though. So there has to be sufficient use cases for that to happen. Otherwise it's just inflationary as the money supply inflates. Currenly inflating around 10% p/a right now :(.
We need to work harder at making it better. We can't just wait for things to happen imo.

It might just be that humans tend to organize themselves in similar patterns over time. 
Mining is already in corporate hands. As the Bitcoin Foundation has been as well.
Maybe what people want is anarcho-socialism, but what we end up getting is anarcho-capitalsm. Which I'm sure is fine with some people. I don't think it's likely that Bitcoin will organize itself in any other way because the incentives are aligned with the corporate path.

25 cents sounds awfully low. Maybe you should do a 'pay what you'd like' thing instead. Hopefully you'd average more than 25 cents per d/l. Even setting the price at $0.99 has to yield a higher return than a quarter(maybe I'm wrong though, it would be cool if you could a/b test that).
@_date: 2014-12-01 14:34:41
Well it costs somewhere in the range of a million dollars a day on average to mine the BTC that are created. Different miners have different costs though so that's just a rough estimate.
But to send BTC peer to peer it currently costs 0.0001-0.0002 BTC depending on your wallet's default fee. 0.0001 is the minimum though.
@_date: 2014-09-29 21:21:42

There seems to be a lot of people who have an agenda against PoS. Really everyone(other than people who have invested millions in mining I guess) should be promoting research in the area. Maybe we are a year or two away from a fully robust PoS system, but the reward is definitely worth the effort.

The current political situation of Bitcoin development does not bode well for the future. They're strictly playing defence.
This is what gives other technologies a huge advantage going forward. They can afford to really compete with Bitcoin on a technical and usability level while Bitcoin developers will never consider turning their project in to something that's meant to compete in an open market.
This isn't a problem now. But it almost certainly will be eventually. Unless things drastically change that is.

Regular people who don't use crypto now? 
If they think Bitcoin is too volitile they can use Bitshares' bitUSD, or NuBits which are both cryptos that are pegged to the USD. 
If they use cloud storage at all like dropbox or google drive, Storj is gearing up to offer significantly cheaper per byte decentralised, redundant, encrypted storage to everyone.
NXT and Counterparty have smart contacts and decentralised asset exchanges. Now it might be a bit of a stretch to think that regular people would care, but years down the road it's possible that it works out to be an alternative market with a lower barrier to entry for both companies and investors. Swarm also allows people to crowdfund new compaies via crypto and gain equity.
SuperNET is bringing all of the new technologies and features to people in a singular HTML5 GUI targeted for mass adoption and ease of use. Instead of all of these features being spread out across multiple currencies, SuperNET links everything through a decentralised network layer(including Bitcoin). With a 6 figure marketing budget it's probably the best hope at getting new people using crypto(outside of one other yet to be released project that I know of). 
There is of course lots of other tech around the alt scene, but a lot of it is targeted at business, or anonymity and such and thus not really the 'regular people' market.

I definitely see your point and agree that he might not see it as a positive gesture.

I doubt that as everyone in Bitcoin now but the most stubborn people will be able to witness first hand such a major transition. And considering how easy it is to swap your BTC for whatever comes next, if anything all the people now that missed out on being early adopters will be happy to get their chance to be one on the new technology. It's not going to happen overnight, I think it will be plainly obvious if Bitcoin is in the process of being overtaken, and the capital flow will be in favour of anyone holding BTC as they'll be able to convert them on the spot.
That is of course if that ever happens. But if anything, everyone here except the biggest BTC whales and earliest adopters should be hoping for that day. As it will only be people outside of crypto who end up being the early majority/late majority adopters.

That would be a one way path for revenue though. People pay to get on the road, but you don't give them back their money when they get off. 
Bitcoin as a fiat intermediary/payment system works both ways, people buy it, use it, and then generally it's sold for fiat.
Demand has to be larger than supply, and that's not easy at a high price with constant inflation via mining.

Really? 
The top twenty(or even the top 50 really, but there are ~10 coins that aren't so good) here minus  and  don't even know what these are, might be a misleading marketcap) are all much different than Bitcoin and innovative in their own way. 
Doge/LTC are the most similar to BTC, but at least in 2011 LTC was interesting and offered a real alternative implementation. And Doge built it's own adoption/community. Now you could argue that Bitcoin could serve the Doge and LTC communities, but other than that most alts these days are significant improvements on Bitcoin, but lack the network effect that makes Bitcoin  
There seems to be some sort of myth that still exists in the Bitcoin community that alts are all just clones of Bitcoin and don't actually offer anything different, but anyone who looks in to the modern alt scene quickly finds that's not the case at all.
@_date: 2014-11-04 21:15:22

Mining is done by finding the correct SHA256 hash, not by verifying transactions. The transactions are included in the block at the discretion of the miner who solved it. They can include all of them, or none of them and there are no penalties.

Lets be honest here. Bitcoin obviously provides an environment that attracts criminals. I've been following Bitcoin for many years now and even without doing some sort of quantitative study I think it's safe to say that due to the incentives involved and lack of recourse there is always going to be more scamming on average than with fiat.
Just because it's true doesn't invalidate Bitcoin though. That's the price of freedom. You have to protect yourself and help protect others in the market if you want it to thrive.

Yeah, I agree in general but if I were to attempt this strategy I'm basing it on the assumption that I will be able to recognize another bitcoin mania starting. So I'd be pulling out of the short and holding a neutral position until I was confident enough that we were in mania mode before going long. Not saying this is a foolproof strategy or anything. I think I'd have a reasonable chance at making it work after following Bitcoin since 2010 and witnessing all of the ups and downs first hand.
Short term is essentially random yes, but if the long term downward pressure on BTC holds with the sporatic bubbles that we see continues to hold, then it's quite possible someone who can recognize a bitcoin mania can make money. 
Actually it's not that different than many peoples strategy of just buying BTC during bubbles is, except in this case you're actively shorting it most of the time.

With the current political situation of Bitcoin development it seems that it's almost inevitable that another currency will over take Bitcoin *eventually*. Who knows when that will actually be, maybe 5, 10, 20 years or more. 
Either that or a real strong team steps up to fork bitcoin, but that seems like it would be extremely difficult and not the path of least resistance.
If we see a major political shift in Bitcoin then Bitcoin could easily hold its position. But that's not going to happen anytime soon.

Because these are the type of people that can potentially bring bitcoin to the next level. There's still tons of innovation left for bitcoin and MIT students are precisely the type of people who are capable of creating great things.
Even for the students who have no direct interest in contributing to bitcoin directly, the fact that they'll have first hand knowledge of bitcoin could have big benefits. Some of these people are going to be the technical leaders of tomorrow and this could be the difference between them supporting and understanding it or being apathetic and ignorant of it.

That's true. If someone in the Philippines could go to the local market and buy their groceries and such with Bitcoin it would have a much better value proposition.

Because I generally don't expect the core dev team to make any major changes to the protocol. And if they do it will take a very long time for people to sort it out politically.
Where as the altcoin community(while rife with scams and idiots as well) is incredibly competitive and agile and are constantly writing new code(from scratch, not forking bitcoin) and implementing innovative tech. The motivation and economic incentives line up well there for developers. While in bitcoin the dev team only has incentive to push through major changes if they see it as absolutely necessary. They aren't competing with anyone. and even if there were real competitors, I don't think the bitcoin foundations mandate will ever be to compete and protect bitcoin's market share. Which is fine, they're not a business. 
Plus bitcoin is so far ahead that it doesn't matter at this point what new tech altcoins come out with. But even 5% of the crypto market is huge for them.

It's actually an entirely new protocol that uses UDP instead of TCP/IP and the network never knows your IP at all. It was designed by jl777 for BitcoinDark, but it's going to be available to use on SuperNET so you won't necessarily have to use BTCD if you don't want to. Whitepaper is mostly complete and will probably released as soon as the math guy finishes up that part of it.
Aside from that there's also a lot of interesting implications with the protocol for anonymous messaging and serving data/web stuff.

The only person currently working on the protocol is Gavin for political reasons and he's doing his thing trying to solve basic problems that Bitcoin faces. He already has his work cut out for him for the next few years and he's doing a fine job protecting Bitcoin's stability too. 
edit: I chose my words poorly there. I wanted to convey the message that I wasn't some investor in Ether trying to talk down Bitcoin for the sake of it. But what I actually think is Etherum *might* be a disaster for investors. The model is uncharted and different. Who knows. And in a technical sense they are incredibly ambitious and have a lot of problems to solve. I'd like to see them succeed at what they set out to do but it will be difficult when the bar is set so high. Either way they will definitely produce a lot of value for everyone in terms of technology and furthering knowledge.

I used to read the bitcoin/buttcoin thread on something awful back when btc was worth a few dollars. Quite a few of the regulars in that thread were making hundreds(if not thousands of coins) from scams. People were much more trusting and naive a few years ago. If any them held their btc or sold them any time in the last year or so they would be doing quite well financially.
Bitcoin has always offered some pretty ridiculous incompetency which makes it an easy target. I don't really blame them, it's pretty hilarious. But on the other hand I really wonder if they had the foresight to hold some of those ill gotten gains they had.

Well the change could introduce something that renders his mining profitability zero or lowers it quite a bit. Something like PoS or perhaps a change to the way pools work. Maybe something that kills pools all together. Then you have all the pool ops wanting to keep all the money they make on fees as an incentive.

Despite that, for the vast majority of people that's exactly what it is. Most peoples interest in bitcoin stems from them wanting to make money investing in it, whether we like to admit that or not.

For most people it's all about the promise of getting out of the economic system and gaining value. It's just the truth.

To build a project free from the political issues surrounding Bitcoin development. To have the freedom to improve the core at a rate faster than what currently goes on in Bitcoin. Lots of things can theoretically be added to Bitcoin but likely never will be.
Sidechains might be interesting if they can solve some of the issues with incentives. If sidechains can work well enough that might limit a lot of alts that don't build their own separate economy and public adoption distinct from Bitcoin. If their selling point is tech and the tech gets put on a sidechain that can be used by people with BTC then it's likely the only ones remaining will be ones that build their own independent communities and create their own demand.

Sure, I'd love it if we could pay the devs enough to live off of it. But I was just saying what I would think would happen if push came to shove and Electrum users couldn't get enough cash together.
As you know the vast majority of people contributing to F/OSS are doing it on their spare time for free. As time goes on more and more people are realising the value in paying people to contribute, but when it comes down to it most of the time people are going to keep a project alive just for the love of it. That is if they feel it's worth it. And Electrum in my opinion is one that is, and I'm assuming there are lots of people who share that opinion. Maybe I'm wrong, I hope not though.

Yeah, that's all just electricity and such with the million a day.
The actual protocol enforces a minimum fee of 0.0001 BTC per transaction I think. You can try to manually send a transaction without a fee but I think it generally just gets ignored by the network.
@_date: 2014-09-18 14:33:55
Yeah, that's a reasonable point.
@_date: 2014-12-13 12:40:46
Yes. It's not all or nothing. Simply calling things 'centralised' or 'decentralised' often simplifies a complex issue that can't always be described so easily and still be accurate.
@_date: 2014-12-30 15:00:59
Yes, after the fact people will realize that their hashing power has been used to attack the network but they would still be able to execute an attack. 
And it's not in their financial interest to do so of course, I know that. If it was we probably wouldn't be having this discussion at all as it likely would have happened already.
My main concern is just the trust factor. The more decentralised mining is, the closer Bitcoin gets to Satoshi's original intention of a trustless currency. It's a spectrum, right now it's better than it was earlier this year. Hopefully it will continue to get better over time.

The difference here is that people investing in Ether are expecting to see a return on their investment.
And even though many people will directly benefit from Darkwallet, I don't think people see the direct economic benefit.

Yes, there's currently no incentive for consumer adoption. Merchant adoption is a fairly easy sell though. But unless something comes along to change that I don't think there's any clear path to consumer adoption with Bitcoin. Better to realize the weaknesses and focus on the strengths instead.

I know that the market cap of Bitcoin has to correlate with the amount of money moved through the network. Your analogy of it operating like a road is flawed however.
The price has to rise by demand outstripping supply. Getting Bitcoin's market cap and liquidity up is not easy with Bitcoin's rate of money supply inflation. 
People will have to develop solid uses cases and grow the actual Bitcoin economy to sustain higher prices.

You're not wrong, but then again a lot of people who follow Bitcoin aren't the type of crazies you encounter on here. Not everyone is irresponsibly pushing Bitcoin on everyone they know.

I think there will probably be another bubble, but tbh I have no idea what is going to drive it or where the demand is going to come. Especially given how far Bitcoin has come and how well known it is already. Maybe a China part 2 or something. Who knows. 
I'd be fine with the last bubble being the 'big one' anyway. Too much focus on Bitcoin as a get rich quick scheme in this community.
Where do you think the hundreds of millions of dollars of demand will come from to drive another bubble?

What about deflation as a psychological motivator for buyers? Just knowing that it's inflationary rather than deflationary would be a disincentive for a lot of people I would think. 
For a government controlled central bank I can see why they want inflation, but for a decentralised currency I don't see the point.

Many people expect there not to be a bubble with LTC again unless bitcoin goes to the moon. In which case all altcoins are going to shoot up anyway.
If people who bought scrypt ASICs have to pump their own money into buying LTC and holding the coins they mined then it's just going to be s very short term band-aid until the house of cards comes down.

There are lots of people who hold very large amounts of BTC. More rich individuals than there are rich cold wallets for a service I would bet. By a long shot. 10 million BTC was mined a little while ago by a very small community and that BTC was also sold at a very low price. The wealth is not spread out at all. 2009-2012 early adopters accumulated some pretty large balances. Just look at the emission curve.

I very much agree with the above poster. Be careful with Bitcoin, the Bitcoin economy itself is still growing and is quite a lot smaller than most realize at this point. It's extremely hard to fund developers in general and it's always been a constant struggle. Even for the core devs.
@_date: 2014-06-20 16:28:03
You still have to trust a pool to do just that.
So you're placing trust in a single actor. Meaning there is one central point of failure(temporary failure maybe, we would have to see how it worked out).
That's not a trustless decentralised system.
That's accepting the fact that the actor you are trusting is most likely rational.

It shouldn't really. If you benefit from buying a superior product the inflationary or deflationary aspect of whatever currency you're using should factor in to the decision. Whatever provides you with more utility wins.
I think the above train of through is a bit of a stretch.
edit: I don't think people understand my comment. Obviously you'd rather spend the inflationary money. But the claim was that people who use inflationary money are incentived to buy cheap poorly made products due to inflation. Which doesn't follow.

Dear Kronenbourg,
Recently I purchased 6 cans of Kronenbourg lager from my local shop. I drank 4 of them, and gave one to my mum to drink as we had a game of scrabble and had cheese and biscuits. After winning scrabble, I played a bit of poker online (busted someone for 300BB's with 45s after I called his UTG raise from the SB!), I went to bed, and in the morning I felt quite ill, and this carried on throughout the day. After returning home my mother also said she felt ill.
I am a long time drinker of Kronenbourg, it's my favourite lager. I'm a bit worried about the cans of lager I bought, and was quite dissapointed by my purchase of what I usually consider a great quality drink.

He's not wrong technically. But he should have made clear that at this point it's pretty much impossible that enough people would ever support such a thing.
@_date: 2014-11-09 10:17:41
But do you agree that it would be an improvement? It's not an all nothing proposition.
Personally I don't think bitcoin has any future in anything but a fringe retail payment method at best (edit: unless there's some off the chain third party service that can provide sufficient value to consumers). But I don't understand the mass resistance from the community in what appears to me to be a slam dunk improvement. I could be wrong, but the only downside appears to be more orphans. 
@_date: 2014-10-30 09:29:59
It's just happened to be a headline that was available that day. Don't read in to it too much. I highly doubt Satoshi intended it to be the 'crazy bait' that it seems to have turned out to be. Especially considering the lengths that Satoshi went to keep his persona apolitical. I think that was one of his only major slip ups in that regard.

I think realistically there's not much to worry about. But I don't think people are being intellectually honest when they tell people bitcoin is a trustless currency.
@_date: 2014-12-27 20:41:55
Really though, Bitcoin is already successful. It's been around for 6 years now. I guess it's always going to suffer from new speculators eagerly awaiting another bubble, but from any other view point it's already made it. It's out there, it's used by lots of large companies, it's easy to buy and sell(compared to before, not perfect yet), it's gone from fractions of a penny to hundreds of dollars and a multibillion dollar market cap.
Nothing else really has to happen now. It's already here and is a useful tool for some people. Or even just a fun hobby. Things will continue to develop but I think people should let go of this constant moving the goal posts of success. Ask anyone before 2013 if Bitcoin in its current state would be a massive success and they'd surely agree.
If people just dropped the get rich quick scheme overtones and the pump mentality the community would be a thousand times healthier and would probably attract a lot more interest from normal people.

If all they're using is coinjoin for anonymity then the prevailing opinion from what I've seen is that it doesn't really provide much anonymity.
Darkcoin came out with coinjoin as it's 'killer app' and it caught on briefly before basically being demolished by people finding holes in that particular implementation.
I don't know if Darkwallet is doing the same thing, but last I checked all they had at this point was coinjoin. That was a while ago though and perhaps they've made more progress. Hopefully they have.

Bitcoin is vastly overrated for remittances. It's currently not one of the value propositions that Bitcoin offers people. That is unless someone gets paid in Bitcoin and the other person receiving the money can just spend it directly on goods without getting hit by the BTC spread. Right now Bitcoin remittances are not great because people get double dipped by the spread going in and out. 
This guy seems pretty sharp and shows that the big players aren't as stupid as many people here seem to assume. This title is really bad.
People need to work on building up the internal Bitcoin economy more. Bitcoin as just an intermediary for fiat limits its potential to something like a digital gold. But if people really start building economies around Bitcoin it might just work.
@_date: 2014-09-28 14:51:19
I'd never heard anyone put it that way before. There's somewhat of a point buried there I guess. If you think about it, it is more like 'payment processor adoption' rather than Bitcoin adoption.
It's still a good thing for Bitcoin. Anything that encourages any sort of adoption is good.
@_date: 2014-12-28 19:11:13
Some companies might be able to move quickly to avoid regulation and maybe shave a small amount off to avoid dinosaurs like WU. But I expect it's unlikely to really be a major player in the remittance market in the long term. It theoretically shouldn't be able to out compete a centralized entity in a regulated market. I can't imagine that governments are just going to give a company a free pass on whatever barriers to entry exist for fiat based remittance companies in the long run.
There's also quite a few newer remittance companies that look like they'll already be able to beat Bitcoin and WU. But perhaps there's some short term money to be made from companies targeting single markets like the Philippines where a lot of people might not be aware of all the options, or just used to going to a B&amp;M WU store.
I agree with you that people here greatly overestimate the value proposition of Bitcoin in everyday legal commerce for sure too. And I think there will be more use cases that come up over time too, but long term I don't think remittances are going to be a major factor for Bitcoin success.
@_date: 2014-08-24 21:54:20
How do you figure it's deflationary at this point? The money supply is still increasing and will continue to increase for a long time. Also, how do you figure the rate of adoption has an effect on the money supply?
Thinking about it now, I think I'm thinking of inflation in terms of money supply and you're thinking deflationary as in price going up relative to the dollar, is that correct?
@_date: 2014-08-07 17:23:24
Yes, I think this is the best a company can do in the current environment I think. Gox used to operate that way for a while but they ended up changing it if I remember correctly.

Seems pretty unlikely for the US to do a UIGEA style ban on Bitcoin like they did then for poker related payment processors.
Individual banks exercising their right to refuse service to Bitcoin users is likely and seems to be happening now. But for something to happen at the legislation level would take time I think.
As I don't believe any laws are currently being broken, a surprise domain seizure attack on Bitcoin exchanges similar to the one launched on various poker sites also seems unlikely as I don't think there would be much legal standing for them to do that. But of course you never know with the US, and I can certainly understand your apprehensions.
@_date: 2014-12-29 19:10:49

Well the code is open source and in python so it's easier to read than say Bitcoin Core or whatever. I'm personally pretty confident that it's secure and I put my money where my mouth is and use Electrum exclusively.

The culture of Bitcoin creates a barrier that many people don't want to be associated with regardless of how revolutionary the technology is.
I don't know if we're ever going to be able to overcome it, but I truly think that and bitcointalk do more harm than good by a long shot.
@_date: 2014-11-02 19:25:03
It sounds good, but with the current spreads what's the advantage of business using Bitcoin to deal with their b2b payments?
For large scale transactions wire fees are actually very tiny. Normally around $30 I think, which is horrible for regular people sending a few hundred dollars, but when you're transferring a million it's basically free.
I would like to see some more uses for Bitcoin but a lot of them that I can see are limited by the in and out slippage when moving money.
@_date: 2014-12-19 13:54:31
It's not stolen. It's widely known that there is a small inflation target. People who wish to avoid losing their money to inflation invest it in instruments that they believe can outpace the targeted inflation.

There's no point in paying him if he's not personally convinced it's an issue. I don't think paying him 25 BTC is going to change his mind. He needs to have a public conversation where he defends his viewpoint(and possibly changes it as well).

Yeah, I personally really dislike the money supply inflation in Bitcoin. To be honest I feel that a lot of people have been deceived over the years by people calling Bitcoin a deflationary currency. 
Bitcoin is still great technology, but running the numbers makes me think twice about buying more. Maybe after the next halving in 2016.

~10% yearly money supply inflation anyone?
The next mining reward halving can't come sooner imo.
One big difference with now versus a couple of years ago is that these new massive mining commemorates worth hundreds of millions of dollars  *have* to unload coins on the market to cover their seven figure electricity bills. Where as before regular people mined and could either hold all their coins mined, or sell of a small amount to cover their relatively tiny home utility bill.

Bitcoin ATMs generally offer the highest fees in the industry though so it's likely to just magnify the spread issue.

I don't think any one ever seriously considered Litecoin a threat to Bitcoin. A coin with little to no active development based on old Bitcoin 8.x.x and no plans to update it along with a completely apathetic community.
I'm sure it will 'survive' in its downward spiral for a few more years unless someone who gives a damn decides to recruit some people to actually make something out of that quarter billion dollar market cap.

I guess in that case you're not actively speculating since you're not buying the BTC.

Before lots of people could afford to mine and hold. A lot of people had a few hundred dollars a month of disposable income that they could invest in to their hobby. Now these companies literally have seven figure electricity bills every month that must be paid. It really is a totally different ball game now. And I've been observing Bitcoin for a similar time as you have and I think the situation is drastically different now then it was then.
Unless of course someone chimes in with evidence that all these big pools are mining to hold and have cash financing from other sources. And that allows them to pay their costs with out selling their mined BTC.  I doubt that's the case, but I could be wrong of course.
@_date: 2014-03-04 19:51:30

That's why I've been so interested in the idea of shorting BTC recently. I'm not a trader and I don't do it, but the nature of BTC and it's money supply inflation and miners selling those coins makes some downward pressure. And of course the market gets excited sometimes and we get big bubbles, but going short most of the time and then switching over to long during bitcoinmania's is probably how a lot of people are making money out of this.
@_date: 2014-12-22 08:59:40
I think I might agree with your post if this were a different situation but Electrum is actually a pretty good user experience. Not good enough for mass adoption yet, but it's what I would recommend to most people interested in Bitcoin. 
Not having the seed that they explicitly tell you to write down and losing your password is kind of a major fuck up.

That is a lot of demand that's needed to sustain the price.
Perhaps Bitcoin will continue to grow in adoption but at a lower, more sustainable price? The lower price doesn't make it any less useful as far as I can tell.

I'm paying $0.13 and sometimes $0.26 cents if the transaction is enough kb everyday with Electrum. It doesn't seem to accept any less. (0.0002 base fee, +0.0002 per extra kb or whatever)
The fees are out of control in my opinion. Not so much for myself, but the other 4 billion people on the planet who the fees would actually matter to.

I've been observing Bitcoin since before it was worth a dollar and there are a lot of people who have publicly held large amounts of Bitcoin. Lots of things are possible, but it's reasonable likely that the wealth in Bitcoin is incredibly concentrated. Some people take an interest in to researching such things: 
It's probably got more spread out over 2013 though. But even just counting up a few known people who've acknowledged their large holdings plus satoshi's million already makes anyone claiming otherwise unlikely to be true.
@_date: 2014-07-24 19:20:52

Anything can happen really. We could see sustained growth like we have historically through bubbles. We could stagnate as we've been doing recently. There could be some really great services that come out and increase demand constantly and we hover around $2000 or something. Long shot things like countries deciding to keep BTC reserves could mean BTC goes up a lot. Some negative things could happen and we go back under $100(but not to $0). 
@_date: 2014-12-30 10:09:11

I only ever heard the number 750k and 850k thrown around. This is the first time I've seen 950k. If that's correct I guess it's good that they still have 200k(assuming they plan to give it back to their customers).
Why did they claim to only have the 2k btc that was left in the hot wallet in that document or whatever?
@_date: 2014-12-30 16:23:28
Maybe in 2009.
It was the invention of pooled mining by slush in late 2010 that started the push towards mining concentration. At one point Deepbit was ~50% and so was BTCGuild.
The issue was that Satoshi didn't forsee pooled mining. If someone can figure out a way to help spread it out or if people would just use P2Pool things would be a lot better. It has been getting better since Ghash last hit 50% though.

Even waiting for one confirmation can be a very long time. On average it's 10 minutes, but it's often over 30 minutes and sometimes over an hour.
As a merchant you pretty much have to go with a centralised payment processor like Coinbase or Bitpay to offer a reasonable checkout experience for customers.
The rep probably knows about the wait and that's why they'd rather people use Paypal or whatever. Bitcoin as a point of sale tech hasn't really evolved to the point that it can compete with people using their credit cards.
@_date: 2014-12-12 09:26:41
Honestly, I'm getting the feeling you're really over reacting. And despite being someone who bases their life around cryptocurrency I fail to see how this is anything but an argument for using banks. Mistakes happen in crypto and people lose it all. Mistakes happen in Bank of America and a bunch of paperwork and phone calls happen and no one loses anything but time.
I can feel your outrage seething through the screen, but really who cares? No one was going to lose any money here in the end. You could have attempted to steal someone elses money and perhaps someone else in your shoes would have, but only the bank would be out of pocket for that in the end. 
@_date: 2014-10-21 08:23:50

I'm guessing they're 'fine' with that in theory as it's not really up to them how people use the technology and it's just open source software.

@_date: 2014-11-29 16:34:50
The thing is that Bitcoin in it's current state can't offer a cheaper service in the majority of cases due to people getting charged on the spread twice. And even now there are companies competing in the space to offer cheaper alternatives like xoom and transferwise. Everyone just assumes that Western Union is the only game out there, but the market is still maturing now with the economic development of much of the world still in progress. 
Bitcoin has a very long way to go if it's really going to be able to compete in this space. And unless people get paid in Bitcoin and can receive Bitcoin and spend at least some of it, it's not as much as a slam dunk as people on this sub make it out to be.
@_date: 2014-08-07 17:24:55
You're probably right as much as people would resist admitting it.
@_date: 2014-10-18 13:57:28
Actually yeah, I think I chose my words poorly there. It is flatter than other fiat based organizations but that's also why I think it could be a bit slower to adapt. As soon as there is a solution I imagine a bank or something similar will decide to get as many people working on it as necessary to implement the changes as soon as they can.
Bitcoin is a little slower and deliberate I think. And yeah I definitely agree that people in Bitcoin will want to protect themselves. But from my observations forming a consensus in this community is quite the process. Not saying that's a bad thing at all. It's pretty much the whole point of Bitcoin, but speed is not one of it's advantages.

Yes, but unless one of the current core devs or major contributors is already a government agent, it's going to take quite a while for someone to reach a position where they're able to slip in code that can cause critical vulnerabilities.
I'm not saying you're wrong. I think you're right actually. I just think that it's somewhat difficult, but certainly not impossible. And if the NSA decided they wanted to do something like this they would probably be able to achieve it. Could have already happened. But personally I doubt it. Maybe I'm just being naive though.
I also think open source can be quite risky due to the fact that everyone expects someone else to do the hard work and check everything. It's not easy.
@_date: 2014-12-18 20:13:56


That's actually something that unfortunately gets put forth as true to new users when it's not true. Bitcoin's money supply inflates at a predictable rate. And it's price deflationary if and only if demand out paces supply. Which of course is never guaranteed. 
I feel like a lot of people have been mislead by people constantly stating Bitcoin is deflationary full stop.

Yeah, the 'market' seems to be a bit of a moron when it comes to anything to do with Bitcoin. 
Realsolid is one of the most famous Bitcoin scammers of all time dating back to 2011, yet he's able to operate a Bitcoin exchange openly and consistently steal from customers. 
Today it's "we're going to 'destroy' all the coins soon". 
Yesterday it was "we 'lost' 350 million doge because we didn't update our wallets and guess what? we're passing the losses directly on to you, our valued customers.":

@_date: 2014-09-30 16:52:10
I don't think that's really controversial at this point to be honest. You pretty much explained it yourself in your post, yeah, anything could be used as a currency. But you can't send anything over a global, secure, decetnralised network. The value in Bitcoin is it's utility.
The more controversial thing that seems to be the issue these days is that most people seem to be realizing that Bitcoin is really having a hard time finding many use cases where its objectively better than existing solutions. The problem is that a centralized system that can out compete others in a market will almost always be more efficient unfortunately. People really want to be able to buy things with Bitcoin but it really doesn't make sense to buy Bitcoin and pay a 1-8% spread when you can get ~4% cash back and fraud protection using your credit card. 
I guess the hope for us at this point is that people in the world who don't have credit cards might start to use Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-12-15 11:18:03
2014 has been the best yaer for Bitcoin by far. It's really been quite good.
From a top down view it's great for Bitcoin that Gox out of the picture, not considering the unfortunate personal losses suffered by people(which hopefully get refunded at least partially).
And since Gox it's been non-stop adoption and acceptance from all over. All the indicators of adoption are increasing from what I can tell too.

Dogecoin is/was pretty huge. Imagine where it would have been had they left the standard deflationary structure in tact.
How much demand would there have to be for it to increase in value with it's current mining rate? Has the community considered changing it back? Maybe they could have a second coming of Doge.

The standard transaction fee hasn't been 0.0005 for a while now. If it stayed that way at one point it would have cost around 60 cents to send BTC.

Pretty much zero chance someone like 7-11 is going to be accepting on chain payments that are going to be required to be included in a block for them to complete their transaction. 
If they were to accept Bitcoin they would almost certainly be using a 3rd party processor like Bitpay or Coinbase and the transaction would appear to be instant to them.

Guys, RealSolid is one of the most prolific Bitcoin scammers of all time. How is it possible that he's openly running a service where people actually deposit money?

Yeah, I've been trying to come up with a good answer to the big 'Why?' myself for a while. It's not that easy when many countries now offer free instant p2p banking payments via their mobile apps and websites.
It really comes down to freedom. If the idea of controlling your own money doesn't appeal to someone then it's going to be difficult to get them interested unless you can show them a direct benefit to using Bitcoin.

Gox's inability to write code(apparently) caused the current downturn. The fact that one actor can cause losses for others who have no involvement just makes me think(edit: not saying it doesn't happen outside of bitcoin of course). Erik talks about (presumably recent bail outs in America) socializing the losses, but in Bitcoin everyone loses in the short term anyway.
Just made me think, that's all. I don't pretend to have any answers, but it's amazing how something like this can give you different perspectives. 
Gox was never a good company, and they don't 'deserve' a bail out or anything. But they do have a massive short term effect on bitcoin. In the long run it's irrelevant, and in five years or hopefully less this will just be a footnote in the history of bitcoin.

It's not going to be easy for Bitcoin to compete on remittances. Everyone was just thinking about the fact that Western Union kind of sucks, but forgetting that they aren't the only option. 
We're going through a transition period now where people are trying to discover what Bitcoin's value propositions are. So far a lot of the things some people have been assuming Bitcoin to be clearly superior at like consumer payments and remittances are turning out to be out competed.
Bitcoin's real value advantage is that it's truly out of reach from financial regulators and allows people to do things they wouldn't otherwise bea ble to do like issue shares in their business and such. The freedom of Bitcoin is the selling point. 
As Peter Todd has said, Bitcoin is not going to be able to out compete centralized finance in these areas. Even if it does gain short term edges, there's too much at stake here and people aren't stupid.

I don't think you understand what a smart contract is.
I've been following Bitcoin since it hit parity with the USD, and I've seen and followed a massive amount of scams. I've never been scammed though. And if I were to ever decide to partake in some sort of arrangement that made use of a smart contract from NXT, or Ethereum, or Counterparty or whatever 2.0 crypto provided it, I wouldn't get scammed because the code would decide the outcome, not some person that you would have to trust with your money.
@_date: 2014-08-14 11:58:00


That doesn't seem logical to me. As you say so your self(or at least imply), Bitcoin isn't going to be upgrading anything anytime soon. Everyone who follows the development of Bitcoin can gather that by looking at the current political situation. Bitcoin's can go down for any number of reasons as you know, and it doesn't necessarily imply that the crypto space is less appealing.
I don't see any problem with holding some Bitcoin, but I hope you're not seriously using the price of Bitcoin as some sort of barometer to dictate the usefulness of your boundary pushing project. It's your project's money, but personally with that amount of money and such a large project I'd consider more diversification. I agree with the Bitcoin being digital gold analogy but it still seems very risky to put all your eggs in one basket like that.
@_date: 2014-09-24 15:28:53

How much value do you think would be destroyed? In a theoretically efficient market, wouldn't the total value just move over to the new currency?
And couldn't there even be more demand created during this time? If this exodus from Bitcoin due to a state sponsored attack was to an alternative that was more resistant or even immune from such attacks, it could add even more confidence to cryptocurrency as a store of value.
This is all theoretical of course and I have no idea how it would actually go down, but I could see it being a good thing as well.

Yes, more or less I would say. Having an entity mining over half the blocks really does defeat the purpose of Bitcoin.

There are lots of currencies that aren't based off the Bitcoin Core and they all get relentlessly downvoted here. As well as the ones that are based on it and changed significantly.
Even technologies that aren't altcoins themselves but have any whisper of an association get downvoted too.
Two threads recently with in the last day or so I've seen it happen even. Someone mentioned they were developing an atomic chain transfer tech and it was downvoted. And then someone was asking about a decentralised betting platform like Open Baazar was for markets and the same thing happened. 
I can assure you that the general reaction here to anything that's not Bitcoin is incredibly cold from all but a small minority. Peter Todd and Greg Maxwell seem to go out of their way to look into new techs though so it's not everyone.

It suffers from a similar problem as the 'mining BTC in your smartphone idea' in that they're going against the tide of efficiency in scale. Cloud data centers, Bitcoin mining farms, similar ideas, more efficient than consumer general purpose CPUs. Cheaper electricity than consumer rates(by far in many cases), heat issues, limited class of problems that benefit from parallel processing.
To me, Storj's idea is more interesting than this. Hard drive space is something we tend to have in abundance, doesn't draw much additional power at all compared to processing, and getting paid for unused space sounds like a pretty good idea on the surface of it. Maybe they should go to Silicon Valley...

I've been following Bitcoin for around four years now and there's no way that this true. There have been a massive amount of failures and scams that had absolutely no government intervention at all.

I think you're right if you view it from the perspective that they should be selling Bitcoin, or just the idea of it. But I'm not sure if that's what should be done full stop without any consideration of the implications. Bitcoin isn't for everyone and there is a lot involved with using Bitcoin.

I agree that everything has been extremely underwhelming so far. Circle and Paypal were supposed to be huge deals back in 2014 and they've had little to no consequence from what I can tell.
At this point I think it's pretty much down to Wall St. buying in big via some ETFs or similar vehicle and BTC being used as another speculative toy by the finance world, or some sort of major financial disaster which is probably extremely unlikely.
I think BTC was extremely over bought in 2013 with all these things that were supposed to happen in the future being priced in at the time. Just getting back to a level where demand will be able to sustain million dollar ++ money supply inflation via mining is going to take a miracle. It could happen, but it really seems like most of the money has already gone in to BTC by now and there's not exactly a big untapped market of potential investors out there. Other than perhaps the institutional investors like I mentioned before, but that's a huge maybe. 
@_date: 2015-05-01 15:42:31
Not sure about Circle's policy, but if you do this on Coinbase you should expect them to close your account and not do business with you any longer.

Theoretically yes, they could do a 'hard fork' and make confirmations faster. But it's unlikely to ever happen. A 1 minute on average confirmation target is also 1/10th as secure as a 10 minute one because it only takes 1/10th of the same mining power on average. 
Personally I think they should lower it because 1 or 2 minutes is still very secure on a network as powerful as Bitcoin is. But I'm 99% sure that we will never see it changed in Bitcoin itself. All the alternatives to Bitcoin that have come out though all use fast confirmations anywhere from 24 seconds to two minutes.

Another post on here suggested Blockstream is also pursuing Lightning, so that could be one group. It would be better if at least one other group was working on it too I think. Maybe use Lighthouse to fund it. 
Not sure what the situation of the people who created Lightning is though, whether or not they're able to work on it now or have other obligations. But if they need funding I really hope that some of the bigger companies in the space will assist in that regard.

It is an unfortunately true situation. Lots of talk and little commerce in many cases.
One of the issues is that even people who love Bitcoin and hold it have little incentive to spend it, since they'd just have to go and purchase more of it after(and pay a spread as well). 
Personally I try to spend BTC wherever I can. But I just keep small amounts and try to use it as a daily use currency when I can. Not as an investment. But I think most people here are in as an investment rather than a currency. So I don't feel the need to 'top up' right after I buy something. BTC just comes and goes when it's convenient for me.

Right, but the problem is that there's no guarantee that demand outweighs supply. I think calling it a deflationary currency is misleading to many people.
Dollars for example are only inflationary because the money supply is intentionally increased to attempt to keep them at a fixed rate of inflation.
Calling it a fixed supply currency sounds much more intellectually honest to me. I think a lot of people have been confused and mislead by this rhetoric to be honest. Of course its their responsibility to understand their own investments, but still.

Would no cap mean no potential back log of transactions as long as miners include all the transactions?

Not if we change to scrypt. I don't know if you follow alts at all but there is a fairly mature scrypt ASIC industry quietly going on with some decent hashpower.

Why? In what way does this add any more than minimal demand for Bitcoin? Transaction fees and a few Satoshis for coloured coins or something(depending on how they do it).
I agree that it's a net positive and won't hurt. But it's probably closer to neutral value when looking at it from a demand for BTC perspective.

If they're just sending dollars around to people, why bother with this part? And how are the individual devices ever going to get even a single dollar in value available to spend? Say they use some sort of coloured coin and 1 satoshi equals one penny, in order to issue that value to the user of the device the user would still have to either earn or load that amount of value with 21 Inc first. edit: Or they would give them away or something. Issuing a coloured coin backed by dollars could be interesting, but it still doesn't make sense with the mining part.

In the same way Bitcoin is inflationary. The money supply continuously inflates. Right now at around 10% p/a.
Bitcoin is price deflationary if and only if demand outstrips supply and the price increases over time. So I don't understand why so many people say that Bitcoin is inherently deflationary.

Relative to expectations at the time I think you're right about these things for the most part. Except the COIN ETF, we have to see how that works out first. It has taken forever, but it should come eventually.
I think part of the problem is that Bitcoin is already kind of mainstream. At least as mainstream as it's going to get. Progress from 2010-2013 was good. It's just that a lot of people here got swept up in the hysteria and got in near the top.

My current theory is that when they formed in 2013 this was their idea, and it sounded reasonable at the time before the exponential increase in difficulty.

No. I'm scoffing at the idea of someone tipping two cents in value to someone unsolicited. Unless someone specifically asks for some coins tipping such a small amount of value is just silly.

I remember that, but still it's generally accepted on Bitcointalk among people developing anon tech that coinjoin isn't sufficient anonymity. 
I'd actually like to see the issue brought up again and debated because it's almost universally maligned and any new alt that comes out with just coinjoin is ridiculed at this point. Not that it wasn't a great innovation for the time of course. 
If coinjoin can be made to be anonymous I hope someone can demonstrate that to all the people who dismiss it. Life would be much simpler if coinjoin was the answer to anonymity.

Ok, so them automatically spiting the blocks they find and including those payout transactions in the block sounds like it makes sense.
Mining zero fee transactions for those people could work seeing as how unconfirmed transactions in the pennies aren't going to be double spent and can probably be treated the same as confirmed. So waiting a number of hours before 21's mining pool finds a block to have the transaction included could be acceptable. Although attackers might find some angles there, perhaps 21 will have away to mitigate that.
Block size problems that we're all currently debating about seem very relevant to all of this though as well.

Bitcoin the currency really is becoming a second class citizen these days. It has to exist, but only needs to hold enough value to provide incentive for a minimum viable amount of mining to secure the network. And I'd even go as far as saying we're probably over-secured right now with the network as strong as it is(maybe not though, you never have enough security).
This is actually pretty unexpected. I've been following forever and I can't think of anyone predicting a future where the blockchain itself would become so pervasive(maybe I'm missing someone though), but the currency just another statistic to stay within a range of safe values to continue to secure the network.
People have predicted the blockchain being used in all these interesting ways of course, but the context was always in addition to Bitcoin's bitcoin being the main event. There's a very distinct lack of interest or even disdain for bitcoin the currency, all while everyone celebrates the blockchain. I can't say that I don't understand why, it's the same arguments that people have used forever, and some of them have merit. But it's just really interesting to see it play out this way.

The economics of how the sidechains are going to work haven't been fully mapped out yet.
I understand how sidechains are supposed to work via 2 way sequestered Bitcoins if that's what you're asking me. There's still a lot of different ways things can work out in addition to that. Whether they'll be merged mined, or PoS or whatever distributed consensus system people come up with eventually.
If there's a superior sidechain and for whatever reason people felt it being attached to the value of Bitcoin was holding it back, I haven't been told any reason why this sidechain doesn't have the ability to fork off and detach itself. The financial motivation could be there at some point and Bitcoin could just be dead weight adding nothing.

Yeah, the misleading new people has been a problem with Bitcoin for a long time. Hopefully it gets better as time goes on.
One specific thing that's been a constant is telling everyone that Bitcoin is deflationary despite the current ~10% monetary base inflation and zero guarantee that it is price deflationary. It's not inherently deflationary at all really. If demand outstrips supply over a long period the result *can* be a price deflationary currency, but I've found too many people who've gotten the wrong impression about how it actually works. Better to make it clear that when viewed in certain time frames like 2009-2013 demand outstripped supply and the result was a price deflationary currency. But sustaining high prices or exceeding them requires significant demand and should be considered and understood by anyone considering purchasing BTC as an investment.
@_date: 2014-10-16 20:32:05

Users will follow exchanges, as buying and selling BTC for fiat is the most critical part of the Bitcoin economy. At least for the foreseeable future it is. BTC only has value if you can exchange it for something else. And even though there are quite a few merchants that accept BTC, virtually all of them rely on either Coinbase or Bitpay to convert to fiat instantly. So if that option isn't available on the other chain I'd imagine the places you could spend BTC would very quickly dry up, leaving only one option for people: use the chain that the exchanges are on.

You would probably be surprised. Also, while SV is undoubtedly the best place, lots of metropolitan areas have startup scenes and incubators/accelerates, angels, and VCs.
A good idea and the technical skill to develop it is like gold. The business/making profit is kind of an afterthought. Part of the VCs job is to assist in providing resources for all of the business stuff. Users and growth are what they look for after the idea is built, and for that you would generally hire a 'growth hacker', not do it yourself. Especially if your the primary tech person in the startup.
All this VC money flowing around might just be another tech bubble or something(or not, who knows), but it's definitely out there.

There are probably a few people who have made a comfortable living in 2014 shorting bitcoin, so I wouldn't completely disregard the notion. Generally it's pretty clear when a new Bitcoin mania is starting, so getting out of the short and going long might not be the worst trading strategy in the world if you're sharp enough to pull it off. 
The constant downward pressure from 10% yearly money supply inflation via mining makes it something to consider at least. I would never just ignore a potentially profitable strategy just because I personally *like* Bitcoin.

Well if we're using the example of mining then mining the block with the proper hash could be the trigger to payout from a pool of money set a side for that purpose. I don't know any specifics but with Lighthouse for example as far as I know the failure to fund by the project deadline results in it returning all funds to the funders. As long as there's some objective metric(s) that the script/smart contract can use to execute itself it sounds like there's some potential there for things like that to work. People could be paid out in crypto tokens backed/redeemable for USD via the hypothetical financial conglomerate that OmniEdge mentioned in the post you replied to before mine.
I know very little about Ethereum, but I think their primary focus is on this type of stuff. And I guess that's why IBM decided to fork it for whatever blockchain technology they're developing.
It kind of looks like there will be a lot of different options in the future for some of this blockchain tech that people keep talking about. And it's even easier to do if it's groups of companies working together who don't necessarily care about maximizing decentralisation or anything, just making whatever they need distributed enough to provide them with utility*. 
*edit: I don't really know what that utility is yet though. But lots of people seem to think that blockchains are going to be useful for businesses in the future.

The uses of the blockchain that I'm seeing so far from things like coloured coins to Factom like data validation don't appear to necessarily require anything but microtransactions. More fees are always good of course, but I don't see the tools themselves generating any real demand through economic activity with BTC. Maybe I'm missing something, but even if all these things are successful, millions of microtransactions that are primarily a transaction carrying data to be stored on the chain doesn't add up to the same demand generated by say even one company deciding to convert their fiat to BTC to pay employees.
Improving Bitcoin's image though all this acceptance might lead to some indirect demand elsewhere though.
@_date: 2015-05-25 20:32:48
Yeah, I mean it's not technically free or anything. But transaction fees are so minimal that It would take hundreds of millions of transactions for them to add any sort of viable demand. The direct economic impact is minimal. 
Now someone could invent some killer app that uses the blockchain and also creates real demand for Bitcoin as well, that's possible for sure. But I'm thinking now more about the apps that we know about now like Factom, and all these bankers who are excited about 'blockchain technology' but have no interest in bitcoin the currency.
edit: Also, useful apps can give some positive promotion value for bitcoin too, so don't get me wrong, they're likely going to be a benefit in some cases at least.

@_date: 2014-11-09 10:04:56
Wouldn't the simple solution to this be to increase the target block time? One confirmation on a network the size of Bitcoin is extremely safe at this point for any reasonably sized transaction. Even at 2 minute confirms at one fifth of the security as a 10 minute confirm, it would be cost prohibitive to attack for all but the largest transactions. And of course waiting an hour or more for a very large transaction is reasonable. But not a $50 dollar one even a small percentage of the time.
People have always dismissed this suggestion. But I feel that the cost of miners' orphans really pales in comparison to the gains from actual use for real businesses such as OP's business.

3 billion is kind of a lot when you consider it takes almost a million dollars a day to offset the monetary base inflation from mining rewards. It could easily surpass that and go much higher, but it's self limiting for a while until the inflation tapers off. Like if it were ten times higher tomorrow, and we were looking at around 10 million dollars per day in new BTC created, meeting that demand is going to require an absolute paradigm shift. Wall St. is probably our best bet though, so the outlook is better now than it was a year ago I'd say.

Original investors invested 5 million. Then we hear that they close a 116 million dollar round. Now they're saying 'significantly more'.
I realize that the primary way VCs make money is by pawning these things off to the greater fool for their exits. But this is just a whole new level. I desperately hope I'm wrong here, but just the fact that they would release this blog post from which one can assume that these are the talking points that they've been pitching with to continue to raise funding, really makes me question what's going on here. 
Now people are saying that the mining isn't really the point and it's more about devices being agents using game theory to negotiate, as well as DAOs and such. If so, why are they pushing this mining angle at all? Without some new critical piece of information, such as they've make some technological breakthrough in SHA256 ASICs or something, I just don't understand how these ideas have raised and continue to raise significant capital.
Especially considering general purpose CPUs that are already in phones can do small amounts of PoW for verification purposes, no need for an ASIC. And I also fail to see how software alone can't meet the needs of some of their ideas. Mining this way simply isn't a good way to acquire BTC.
I hope there's something I'm missing completely here because I'm just confused now more than anything.

They could just send people BTC when they activate the chip.
Or just become a MSB like Coinbase. They can afford it.
@_date: 2015-05-19 22:46:18
The bitcoin earned by these chips still has to be sent from the pool to the device anyway. Transactions cost 10k satoshis divided by the number of recipients they can fit in to one, and the network current enforces a minimum of ~546 satoshis per transaction anyway.
All of the math so far indicates that the amount of power that a consumer would use here would be converted to bitcoin at a rate far lower than any amount that could seriously be used for commerce.
Everyone here already knows that Bitcoin mining has evolved in to an ultra competitive field with mining clusters being built around the world in extreme conditions, maximizing power subsidies and natural cooling. This is the competition that you face for your share of 3600 BTC per day.
Mining is not the interesting part of Bitcoin anymore. I don't get it.

Considering we had Senator Chuck Schumer publicly speaking out about Silk Road back in 2011 there was definitely a lot of heat on it even back then.
Also, the book Kingpin had already come out detailing how serious the US LE branches are about infiltrating and busting hidden services/proto-darkmarets. It was a pretty good read back then too.
So while it's easy for me to say that I would have been extra cautious, still I think I would have been. I've never even *visited* SR because I didn't think it was worth the risk, despite supporting the general idea on a philosophical level and being very interested in seeing how the market functioned.
I understand that people trusted each other and such, but reading this guys story and then seeing Ross' journal really highlights a severe lack of caution considering how high the stakes were.

Unless transaction fees grow to be larger, all these 'blockchain technology' projects piggybacking on Bitcoin don't really add much value to the Bitcoin economy.
With all the interest in 'blockchain technology' these days it almost seems like Bitcoin will be more successful as a technology rather than a currency. All Bitcoin has to do to continue to provide utility for piggybacking technologies is just maintain a minimum level of security to where attacks are costly enough to disincentivize attackers. Not sure what price point that is, but right now the network is extremely secure, and the minimum viable security level to make the blockchain attractive is probably a lot less than what it is now.
I kind of hope I'm wrong for my own selfish reasons, but on the other hand I'd still be pleased to see the blockchain succeed as a technology even if it doesn't help Bitcoin succeed as a currency.

It's not really a democracy but maybe more like a plutocracy. The big players, the big gateways, the devs all need to make some choices. The chain that follows the money will be the winner.
The community are also customers of the big gateways, and also I'd like to think that the devs are open to listening to the community at large.

@_date: 2015-05-19 16:39:08
That would make sense to me if they weren't producing literally fractions of a cent. You're not going to be doing any commerce with a few satoshis. 
Not to mention that the mining pool has to send them their payment anyway(!). And that costs 10,000 satoshis, divided by the number of recipients they can fit in to one transaction. And the network itself enforces a minimum of ~600 satoshis per transaction anyway.
Bitcoin has never been great at microtransactions below say ~~$5-10~~(edit: when the price was higher, $2-3 is more accurate now) due to the fee, which is intended to eventually become the primary way of compensating miners to secure the network anyway. None of these things that they've outlined make sense in the context of Bitcoin.

Coinbase is a private company though and you have the freedom to send your bitcoin to somewhere else before using it in a way that Coinbase doesn't allow.
If Bitcoin = Coinbase and this was it, then we might as well just abandon it. But they're just one fiat gateway.
And companies like Mastercard and Paypal have totally blocked or shut down accounts over the years for similar things. Banks do it too. Lots of reports on here about accounts getting shut down simply for using Bitcoin, let alone using it for anything illegal or questionable according to them.
Just because me and you know that Gwern is an innocent guy and not some drug kingpin or anything doesn't mean that all these other companies are going to know, or even care.

Not sure how Circle does things, but Coinbase is really strict. Since I can't think of any resent complaint from someone using Circle and getting their account closed I'd assume they are more lenient, but I could be wrong.
They won't take your money or anything I don't think if they do close an account. So it's not the end of the world or anything since hopefully there are lots of good options for people to buy BTC in the US.
Also, it's not really their fault. Apparently they have no choice but to do this to comply with whatever the government is telling them they need to do to continue to operate without problems.
@_date: 2015-05-21 13:39:56
I was going to say that I'm amazed that such a thing doesn't exist, since it seems like it would be a great way to make money by offering miners lower variance. But then I thought that there's no real way to verify someone's hashing unless you're accepting their hashes on their behalf. The estimated hashrates can be gamed by solving a block or two and then stopping your hash, you'll still show up as part of the estimation for a while before you get averaged out. Unless it's done a different way and I'm wrong by assuming the estimation is done by the amount of solved blocks by each relayer.
Still would work though if it was offered by a pool that could verify the fact that you're contributing hashing.

This is the part that really gets me too: Who gives a shit about what the state charges him with or not? The fact the people are using the state's procedures as a defense really takes the cake. The evidence was already presented in the trial as part of the charges for running a criminal enterprise, and the judge used that evidence as justification for giving him a life sentence. I don't even agree with the sentence, but whether or not he has another trial in Maryland for the other murder for hire charges doesn't really matter. Like him being guilty of those are going to change one single person's opinion on whether or not it was him.
The fact of the matter is we have the chat logs. And not only do we have the chat logs, but we have the **blockchain evidence** of him sending the money for the murders. What scenario exists where it wasn't him? How could the chats be fabricated *and* the person who fabricated them also had the private keys to the Silk Road coins and was able to send the transactions that correspond with the chats? 
At the very least I'd accept people choosing not to have an opinion on it. It's still evasive, but it's not a direct contradiction to their philosophy. Instead people are seizing this opportunity to use Ross as a martyr, but all it's doing is completely discrediting the whole movement in my opinion.

How is this any different than their mining pool sending the machines the proceeds of mining? It seems many people have made this point under the assumption that the Bitcoin itself when mined just appears on the chip directly(not saying that you mean this, but it's come up a few times over the last few days). They might direct the coinbase transaction to a bunch of miners and split it up, but I don't see how that transaction is any different than another one. If they're worried about money transmitter laws it shouldn't be any different then if they were simply sending people BTC on their phone that has a hardware wallet and no ASIC(which seems to make much more sense).

I don't know. My initial thoughts are that the miners would raise the price of transaction fees until they maximized their income while still allowing the apps to operate profitably.
They could do that now too, but for now I think most people agree that keeping transaction fess as low as possible is best for growth. Especially since right now it's all real people transacting and not apps(yet anyway).

I don't know, things can certainly improve at any moment. But imagine someone in 2013 saying that in 2015 Bitcoin will be embraced by everyone from the NYSE, NASDAQ, Goldman Sachs to the government of Honduras, but the price is going to be floating around $230. People would call you a troll of the highest order.
What's amazing is just how much optimism was priced in to the market in 2013. As a supporter but also somewhat of a skeptic, Bitcoin has had an incredible amount of good things happen in 2014 and 2015, more acceptance than I would have predicted personally. But it still seems the market is just having its expectations met thus far.
@_date: 2015-05-23 22:05:47
Maybe. But reading the things they've released so far almost makes it sound like they're talking about something that's not Bitcoin.

Defining microstransactions as what size? ~$1 and under is very expensive percentage wise at any reasonable price point for BTC. 
$10 and up is where the fees really start to compare favourably with other value transfer methods. That's ignoring any costs related to the market spreads or fees though.
In general I'd say that microtransactions aren't a strong point for bitcoin imo, and that it's really good for large value transfers when looking at a purely BTC -&gt; BTC transaction(no fiat exchanging which can throw the numbers off). 
@_date: 2015-05-21 13:49:06

Unfortunately I guess the government considers the drug charges and criminal enterprise charge a higher priority.

Hmm, maybe. But there's been a ton of GAW believers actively buying under the impression that GAW was actually going to buy back their XPY at $20. As crazy as that sounds it seems people have actually poured millions in to this scam.
Josh himself might have been pushing up the price as well, but I'm not sure it would have been necessary. But we'll never know for sure unless the SEC or something gets in there and gets records somehow which is probably unlikely.

They must, as a transaction fee market would absolutely demolish their plans if I'm understanding correctly. Even if they manage to group multiple outputs under single transactions, if transaction fees become the primary compensation method for miners they are in trouble, as they seem to be betting it all on Bitcoin being good for microtransactions. Which is interesting seeing as how it's never really been considered a strong point of Bitcoin.

So where do you draw the line then?
Would you still support it if it was sponsored by Mt. Gox? Bitcoin Savings and Trust? Moolah?
We don't have regulation to protect people. This is the market regulating itself by punishing bad actors and the people who help support their scams. I'm surprised that you of all people with your views are against a market based solution to the problem.
How much damage is GAW/Paycoin/Paybase going to end up doing to cryptocurrency? More than whatever damage gets done by people boycotting a single conference?
Also it's apparent you don't have a grasp on the magnitude of the scam going on. Which is fine, no one has time to follow all the scams in cryptocurrency. No one believes that Paycoin poses a threat to Bitcoin in a competitive sense. But there are a lot of people getting burned right now who are living in a cult-like bubble orchestrated by Josh Garza.

And yeah that part about the whole thing coming apart if the price goes down x% is pretty bad. Probably the biggest issue I've read about and enough to keep a lot of people away I'd guess.

Perhaps, but it's still obviously a vastly better consumer experience. You're barking up the wrong tree if you think Bitcoin can compete here. Bitcoin has a lot of potential, but consumer payments is one of the least likely niches that it can fill imo.

Sure there's an advantage for the business. But I think they're saying why would the person above use BTC over their credit card. What's the incentive?

@_date: 2015-01-22 15:51:07


 I don't really see it that way personally. Digital cash is more or less existent already, it's just not implemented fully yet. Bitcoin is a separate asset all together. I don't really see Bitcoin as a competitor in the consumer payments space anyway.

@_date: 2015-01-21 08:13:48
You realize that GAW was selling 'hashlets' that were supposed to be scrypt cloud miners, but there has never been evidence of any actual hashing coming from them? In fact there is direct evidence from the hashrates of LTC and other scrypt coins that there was never any significant hashing added at all. Not even remotely close to the numbers they claimed based on the amount of hashlets sold. It was a clear Ponzi scam from the start and people's money from the Ponzi has been rolled in to Paycoin and 'hashstakers'/prime controllers.
Taking money from GAW is very much equivalent to someone taking money from Pirateat40 when he was running his Ponzi in 2012. Both have all the obvious signs of a Ponzi, yet they make grand claims that aren't directly falsifiable, just like Pirateat40 did. All evidence points to wrong doing, but without opening their books or visiting their facility no one is going to be able to prove 100% that they sold fake hashing. Even though the idea that they were actually selling lifetime hashing contracts that automatically upgrade hardware as time goes on was ridiculous. But in order for them to gain any trust from the community at all the onus is on them to prove their claims are genuine. Yet of course they've consistently lied and failed to do so.
The Paycoin lies and deceit are well documented, but it seems most people are missing the bigger picture here with the GAW scam. It's much bigger than most people here seem to realize.

@_date: 2015-05-15 07:51:59


That's not necessarily true in a world where different technologies can provide different utility, and things can be abstracted over. There's no reason to think that we won't end up using things where Bitcoin itself is just a cog in the works and most people won't even know or care that Bitcoin is involved.
Also, there's lots of places in the world where both the US dollar and the local currency is accepted. The local currencies aren't going to replace the USD, but they still exist.
@_date: 2015-01-31 15:52:23


Yes, they control the money supply and set the interest rate.
 


~~That's a minority opinion.~~ edit: You mean the natural lowering of costs from efficiency, yeah. I misread this part and thought you meant something else.
There's costs and benefits, and deflation is thought to have a higher cost than benefit when considering economic growth. I don't pretend to have all the answers but I doubt that having a few percent deflation offers a better platform for economic growth than keeping a small inflation rate. Promoting lending and avoiding liquidity crunches by balancing the money supply clearly works well. If you think deflation offers better incentives for economic growth that's fine, but as I'm sure you know modern economic thought disagrees with you.
I think there are lots of problems in modern society, but vast economic growth is one of the things that seem to have gone right. And it gets replicated over and over again in countries that achieve economic development. How that growth gets distributed and how it benefits society is another matter though.

Having followed Bitcoin closely since I saw it hit parity with the USD i agree with you 100%. It's already successful beyond most peoples wildest expectations.
The only people crying now are the new wave of speculators that have come just to try make a buck off it. It would be nice if the community could segregate the pumpers and get rich quick people. I think it taints the community both internally as well as how Bitcoin is perceived by the public.

Accountants and auditors perhaps? Maybe the central bank as well in some countries? Not sure how it works everywhere. I know in the EU there was some stress testing that was done to banks which necessarily implies to me at least that their records and claims would have to be scrutinized.
Also, if a bank failed and it turned out that records were being deliberately forged or changed, wouldn't there be some criminal charges?
And then the Fed itself is apparently reasonably transparent: 
@_date: 2015-05-22 21:27:12
This isn't necessary at all I don't think. 
Adam Back already invented PoW/Hashcash for exactly this reason. You don't need to spend satoshis. Using hashcash as it was originally intended is enough to fulfill the same result without having to bother with the added unnecessary layer of a blockchain. Any modern device that can send an email has the ability to do some micro amount of PoW.
So considering this has been invented and possible from the 90s I don't think it's going to catch on for email. Instead it turned out that Adam's invention directly lead to Bitcoin mining interestingly enough. 
@_date: 2015-01-28 12:43:40
I guess you never know 100% with anything, including your Linux box you use to make a cold wallet(not that it's likely at all that Linux has a backdoor). But at least here it's pretty unlikely as Satoshi Labs is a real company with real people behind it. Hell, the founder(or one of them at least) invented the mining pool(for better or worse... :P).

I did a similar thing in either 2010 or very early 2011, not sure which. I went to the old bitcoin.org site back when it was just a white page with some text and a download link. At the time I had some sensitive work related things on my computer and I was very fearful of any sort of downloads due to malware, so I passed on downloading it and just followed the forums instead. 
Probably could have CPU mined back then too at 50 BTC a block. :/
But realistically I know I wouldn't have held it over 5 years. So it doesn't bother me too much.

Not really. If anything he did a good job of not muddying up the waters too much with political garbage.
A lot of people like to believe that he implied some sort of anarchistic leanings with his posts, but really it's quite a stretch. He might have personal held sympathetic views towards that area, but he definitely went out of his way to stay pretty neutral. 
The genesis block news event is the closest thing, and really bank bailouts are a wide ranging topic and don't necessarily imply anything. 
@_date: 2015-01-18 08:50:55


Both. 
But he was scamming long before Paycoin with fake scrypt hashing contracts called 'hashlets'. Paycoin is just the continuation of the ponzi so he could roll over all the money he owes people in to a new scam that will eventually fail. He's probably deluded enough to think he has a chance at working out though.

To be honest since I started following Bitcoin I've gained a lot more respect than I previously had for many government programs and systems. I also know some people who've completely changed their political beliefs based on their experiences with Bitcoin and its community(away from anarchist leanings).
There is a ton wrong with lots of western society's laws and such still, but really the financial system(minus any bad actors that try to game it) is probably one of the more sound parts of modern society it seems.

That's a good list, but bitcointalk allows a certain level of freedom to users and doesn't get paid by GAW for their sig campaign.

Wasteful depending on how you look at it. But yeah it's fine if and only if it's truly the only way to come to a distributed consensus. Which doesn't really look to be the case these days, but the jury is still out.
If we get stuck with mining, so be it. But I really think there should be a greater community effort to support research in to alternatives. And I especially think that people should drop the arrogant and dismissive attitude(not you) towards exploring other systems.

Surprised that no one else makes this connection. Most governments aren't nearly as centralised as people make them out to be. Not saying that they're trustless, or fully decentralised. But the ideas are not on opposite ends of the spectrum as many people seem to believe.
It's especially funny that the bleeding edge distributed consensus tech now in cryptocurrency is Bitshares' Delegated Proof of Stake. Where stake holders vote in 101 delegates to sign blocks and such. Not saying that's necessarily a bad system or anything(but I read lots of criticism so I'm not sure what to make of it yet), but it's interesting that things have evolved that way. It's also interesting most of the latest tech strives to create an actual deflationary currency rather than the self limiting inflating emission schedule of Bitcoin.

So I wonder when all the people that have been 100% sure that the USD is going to hyperinflate some time in the last 6 years are finally going to admit that they were wrong? 
Might be some good reasons to use Bitcoin, but this is one of the sillier arguments for it I think. The probability of this happening in the next 5-10 years has to be extremely low.
If hyperinflation had a reasonable probability of happening then perhaps Bitcoin might be a good choice to hedge against it, but as it stands it's so unlikely to happen that you might as well not consider that specific scenario when analyzing it.

The one sending Bitcoin has to buy BTC first at a cost, then the family also has to sell that BTC at a cost. We're very far away from that being a viable method.

Like for example if there was a way to slow emission to make it more inline with current demand people would be losing a lot less money. Not that it needs to be done by a central authority necessarily of course. Ideally it would be done by an objective decentralised process.
That or just make it an actual deflationary currency that doesn't constantly incentivize newly created coins to be sold. Pretty sure people would rather go down with the ship though out of spite than come to any sort of consensus that would potentially help add value and stability.

Yeah these are good things. Although the lack of incentive for nodes is not great. But I doubt that will be much of an issue as nodes are necessary and even if people have run them with no compensation it's a no brainier for someone who holds a signifigant amount of BTC.
I'd be worried though if there was a long term downtrend in full nodes though.
But those positive attributes don't directly affect demand for BTC. So while they're a fundamental part of the technology, they're not really a financial fundamental.
Normally when talking about the fundamentals of an investment you're looking at the numbers. And I don't really see too many that I'd consider good. 
One fundamental that I left out was the total amount of transactions. That could be a good one depending on how many of them a legitimate commerce vs artificial stat inflation. Long term trend of growing legitmate transactions would be a good fundamental.

GAW has been a running a Ponzi for a while now through fake cloud mining contracts like their 'hashlets'. 
Paycoin is just the next stage in the Ponzi. People who were invested in GAW are getting rolled over in to Paycoin as a way to keep the scam going.
If Paycoin was a standalone coin it would just be a regular scam, but GAW had been scamming already for most of 2014. Which is why it's quite worrying that all of these Bitcoin media outlets and the Miami conference have been taking money from GAW. It's not a new scam, it's been around a while now.

But even though there have been a lot of scams, some of those millions have ended up in the hands of competent people working on real projects. So it's not a total loss.

Step one: Pump the price as much as possible as soon as the difficulty chages.
Step two: Deploy as much hash power has you can get via actual hardware or rentals. Approach major miners and offer them a higher ROI than they are currently getting mining, enough that they can turn on unprofitable machines again.
Step three: After the ~2 weeks of high hashrate and price pumping the difficulty will raise. As it does you shut off all your hardware, stop all rentals and dump every BTC you have to attempt to drive the market as low as possible.
Step four: Between the high difficulty and now lowered price mining won't be profitable for some miners so they'll turn off their hardware. You also turn off all your hardware so the network's hash rate is now significantly dropped.
Optional step five: Create a SHA256 alt that is supported by your buywalls that's significantly more profitable to mine than BTC. Miners mine and sell this liquid coin instead of BTC making the blocks even slower.
Result: Depending on how high you pushed the difficulty and how many miners the dump pushed out of profitability blocks will be solved much slower than 10 minutes on average. Since retargets happen every 21xx blocks the next retarget could take an extremely long time depending on how low the hashrate gets.
A well executed attack his way could be much more damaging than a simple 50% attack to double spend. And the cost could be significantly cheaper. But the more money you spend the more effective the attack will be.

It's only really opposed to the most extreme central controlling ideologies. The issue that I have is that many people in the community take this fact and extrapolate it to mean that Bitcoin necessarily is a tool for the opposite political extreme.

Someone can be disinterested in Bitcoin and still see the value in exploiting the properties of its blockchain to build upon.
Pretty good overview of how Bitcoin can also work for people who might not really have a good grasp of it yet. But I also think there's going to be a sizable amount of people who simply reject Bitcoin as a currency, but use one of the many apps that are being built on Bitcoin's blockchain. They'll just see it as a common resource that provides them utility with a low cost, that being transaction fees mostly plus any middle man fees that might be involved. 
Bitcoiners will secure the blockchain above some minimum viable amount, and some others will just take a free ride on it.

In this case it was fairly easy to fix it and go back. But in the future(and in other cryptocurrenies where it has happened for example) if anything like this ever happens again it will likely be a huge point of contention. It's very easy to fix things via a rollback, but some people believe that should never ever happen. A huge 'game over' style exploit like this is pretty easy to agree with, but other situations can be more tricky.

Bitcoin can exist in an economy with a government controlled currency. It's not a one or the other thing. You say I'm making things up, but you're the one insisting that Bitcoin necessarily entails a specific political ideology. I'm not claiming anything other than Bitcoin being politically neutral.
You think the design choices were made solely because of political reasons, if I were to speculate I'd say the were made because of economic ones. Primarily designing the emission curve to provide incentive to miners and restricting supply over time to promote growth. There's nothing inherently political about a decentralised system that conforms to a known algorithm.
It's also irrelevant whether or not Satoshi himself was motivated by political ideology when he created Bitcoin. Based on his writings I think he specifically avoided trying to brand Bitcoin as a political project. By your logic if I were to create a decentralised, deflationary limited supply cryptocurrency today my design choices would be motivated by a specific political ideology. When in reality those properties can be desirable to many different political ideologies. And there's nothing inherent about cryptocurrency that makes it incompatible with the state, or makes it incompatible in a system that also has government issued currency. 
Your logic seems to be that Bitcoin has properties that make it desirable for people who subscribe to anarchistic political ideologies, therefore Bitcoin is inherently a political tool to promote that agenda. What I'm saying is those same properties are desirable for a whole spectrum of political beliefs, not necessarily as a singular currency, but as an positive addition to an economy. Decentralisation has nothing that necessitates the rejection of the state.
All that's happened is that Bitcoin has been co-opted by a large amount of people with a specific political agenda who also happen to be the most vocal. Over time there's been more and more vocal resistance developing by people who feel that the rhetoric is being dominated by that group. No one is going to chance anyone's mind, but I'd expect to see more people speaking out about it and perhaps some segregation of the community based on political belief, or desire for Bitcoin to be apolitical.

It's almost certainly more expensive. It's mostly a myth that Bitcoin solves foreign exchange and transfer issues.

Massive due diligence failure here. And that's being generous and assuming that Moe and others actually weren't aware of what GAW's business model was.

That would require ~416 tps at the standard fee of 0.0001.
Also, most(?) people now seem to think that for any reasonable transaction volume we're going to have to look for off chain solutions.
@_date: 2015-05-23 21:17:08
Mainly because they decided to keep all of the tokens from what I understand. Ripple Labs controls all the XRP for the most part, so in that sense it's centralised at least.
Would a similar project without an inherent token work? For transaction fees fractions of the transfer would be taken instead. Like if I send $1, could the fee be automatically taken out of that? Like $0.005 or something?

What's more important, miners losing a small(?) amount of revenue due to increased probability of 'orphan' blocks, or the superior user experience of being able to accept a transaction at a fraction of the time?
One 2 minute block would be as 20% secure as one 10 minute block, but one 10 minute block on our current network is extremely secure. 
One 2 minute block at 20% would be sufficiently secure for lots and lots of transactions. And I'm sure we've all experienced waiting an hour for a *single* confirmation. While one hour is pretty rare, half an hour is far too common to provide a good user experience. 
One shorter confirm also eliminates a while category of double spend attacks on unconfirmed transactions.
If there are any other considerations other than miner's 'orphan' rates I'd be curious to read them.

Also, your local buying power doesn't necessarily drop when your local currency loses value against another pair. It's not really a cut and dry process.

So the question is why are so many people here married to the idea that mining is the only way to run a cryptocurrency? It's incredibly wasteful.
I'm not going to say I have all the answers. But the complete and utter dismissal by many Bitcoiners of even considering other options is crazy imo.
Why don't more people support research towards other methods of finding a distributed consensus? Even if only to acknowledge that the benefits from a method that doesn't waste millions if not billions of dollars would be a huge benefit.
But even the mention of researching such things here is met with bitter dismissal and vitriol.

A bank wire with whatever bank offers the best fx spread will likely be better. I'd guess you could find a bank offering a wire at something like $30 flat fee and 1-2% spread of the exchange. Almost certainly better than you trying to move 100k from CAD to BTC and then out again in to USD. 100k of slippage + BTC spreads x 2 is not a great value proposition at all.
USD to USD might be a lot better if you can use an exchange with high liquidity and a low spread, but I highly doubt it with CAD to USD.

For the purpose of example and not meant to be morbid on purpose, Jeff Garzik has mentioned that he has something like ~350 BTC. If he were hit by a bus tommorow(hopefully not) it's pretty clear that Bitcoin would lose much more value than what it gains from having his coins unaccessable.

All that was paid for with ill-gotten gains from a scam that's been running for many months now. If hashtalk is any reflection of reality people are maxing their credit cards and going in to overdraft for this thing. It can be hard to have sympathy for all the people that are in the GAW cult, but it doesn't change the fact that this thing is draining millions upon millions of dollars out of the crypto economy. 
Just because people should ideally be aware of the risks with any investment, doesn't make it right to accept that money.
While some people might have had a good time over the weekend thanks to some of Josh's money, the long term economic damage is going to be greater than any perceived gains from that little social event.
The fact that you can others can still frame it this way really illustrates a major issue when it comes to 'self-regulation'. GAW has built its self up on the back of a large part of the Bitcoin media and now events such as this. It seems that people are willing to forego the greater health of Bitcoin to seek short term financial gains. 'The market' is supposed to incentivize rationality, but clearly there's a massive disconnect between what is supposed to happen and what the current reality is in this community.
Hopefully by supporting good actors like Coinfire, speaking out, and not financially supporting people in this community who perpetuate everything that's been wrong with it over the last 6 years, we can slowly move to a market based solution where bad actors eventually see their short term gains wiped out by the long term rejection of their services.

There's only two full anonymity solutions that I know of now that cover both the network level anonymity and the blockchain level anonymity:
XMR(ring signatures) with I2P integration(network level, TOR is not considered sufficient at this point for strong anon).
And BBR(ring signatures + unlinkable inputs) used with SuperNET to take advantage of BTCD's Teleport/Telepathy technology which enables transactions to be sent with no identifying information(IP ect.). Teleport also has a few other features beside network level anonymity that help protect against sybil, mantissa and other deanonymization attacks.
Also Bitcoin will likely be able to be used with SuperNET to use Teleport/Telepathy which should significantly increase privacy for Bitcoin users, but no ring signatures of course. Actually I'm surprised that there doesn't seem to be much anticipation yet among Bitcoiners as it should be a huge improvement to privacy for Bitcoin users should they choose to take advantage of the technology. This effectively offers Bitcoin users a result similar to sidechains without the two way pegging, using inter-blockchain technology

In terms of single users owning less than Satoshi owns? There are probably quite a few of them that have small marketcaps, but XMR and NXT are unlikely to have any single person holding that amount. Especially after all the liquidity over the past while. They both may have had people owning such high amounts at the start but it doesn't appear that anyone holds more than 8% at this point. Just like in BTC it doesn't appear that anyone other than Satoshi holds more than 8% now either.
Distribution improves over time for a lot of currencies that are relatively liquid(for alts at least), especially when the big holders use their funds to pay for things like development and such. One problem with Bitcoin is that Satoshi's coins have just been sitting there forever and no one knows what's going to happen with them. So it adds a lot of uncertainty. If he was spending them from the beginning and cashing out and distributing them in a transparent manner it would remove a lot of that uncertainty. It's a huge unknown that hangs over BTC. Even if we don't think he'll ever touch them or spend them, how do you convince an investment bank that? Or a government who wants to add BTC to their reserves?
Bitcoin distribution is not great, but it's not bad either. But things could get a lot better. If another really liquid currency begins to catch on and large holders liquidate some of their holdings it could easily end up with a much better distribution than BTC.

The difficulty changed last time and now the average block is around 8 mins due to increased hashing power. If this happened every time it seems he would be correct. Difficulty adjustments can not see the future.

Has there been any talk and/or preplanning about this? Hard forks are kind of a big deal and right now difficulty being stuck too high seems like it's by far the biggest threat to Bitcoin.
Having some sort of formal plan seems necessary. There's a lot of variables here. Like what average block time is enough for people to consider a hard fork. And what would the difficulty be set back to. It would be a pretty scary situation to actually need to have manual intervention to fix the network.

I've gone over this in other posts, but I personally don't expect Bitcoin to be able to compete long term in the modern remittance market.
Beat WU in the short term in certain markets while Bitcoin based remittance companies fly under the regulation radar? Possibly. It wouldn't make sense for Bitcoin to win the long run though, as Peter Todd and others have observed, decentalisation has a cost. And theoretically centralized finance should out compete in the long run.
Euro &gt; BTC, BTC &gt; Peso for example inherently has the disadvantage of having to eat the spread twice. It might work for a little against dinosaurs like WU. But over time I can't really see it winning.

The real test will come when Lighthouse is released and people have the chance to put their money where their mouth is and fund projects.
To be honest I'm expecting to see very little financial support distributed via Lighthouse. I'm basing this on my experience and perception of the community over the years and my observations on how little donation funding most projects get(save for a few big whales like Oliver Janssen who are very generous). But I will be pleasantly surprised if I turn out to be wrong and money does in fact flow to people building interesting things.

You wouldn't get 25 BTC every 10 minutes, you'd probably get 25BTC every x amount of years given the difficulty. 
The network being stuck at high difficulty is a very real danger that few people seem to acknowledge. Especially if an attacker with resources decided to exasperate the effect by pushing up the difficulty by renting significant hash and then pulling it. And then adding insult to injury by dumping some BTC on the market as soon as the high difficulty kicked in.

I'm under the impression that mixing in general is a dead-end for anonymity. Better than nothing, sure. But mostly a false sense of security.

It's not changing the subject to point out that people weren't buying yachts, castles, and Ferraris with BTC before. The reason they were buying them in the last couple of years is simply because they now had the money to do so. Bitcoin at 13 dollars functioned just fine as a currency. I don't think it's going to go down to 13, as there's likely more than enough demand to keep it above that. But people wanting to buy high price tag luxury items is a result of BTC's high price, and not the cause or even something that adds any demand at all. No one is ever going to convert fiat to BTC specifically to buy a luxury item. There's no incentive to do that right now at all, and I doubt that's going to change any time soon. Even with a discount, the spread, the slippage, the hassle is not working in Bitcoin's favour.

On the bright side Bitcoin's lack of privacy might draw some interest from big companies that eat that stuff up like Google and Amazon.
@_date: 2015-01-05 17:55:50
Exchanges are pretty much the only privacy we get though in terms of mixing our coins through a trusted party. There might be mixing services out there or whatever, but exchanges generally do the job with less risk.
It's fine if people want to use a transparent exchange, but I also imagine there will still be lots of demand for the standard setup we have now. 
Bitcoin is so public and transparent already that it makes me uneasy about taking away the one in and out transaction where I can't reliably be tracked by anyone but the exchange themselves.
With purchase points tracking already like Coinbase and Circle, this trend towards zero privacy worries me a lot. And a lot of smart people seem to dismiss coinjoin as any sort of strong privacy. It might be 'good enough' though, I'm not really sure yet.

Yeah, banks take their fees in other ways when they can. But it's not like you're going to stop using bank accounts any time soon. So as long as you have a bank account then taking advantage of any free services they offer is a benefit.
For me I have two accounts with two separate banks opened right now and they both have annual fees of ~$7. So the free transfers aren't free when looking at it from a birds eye view, but since I'd have the accounts regardless of whether I get free transfers or not, I'm effectively getting them for free anyway since I'd be paying the annual fee regardless simply to have a bank account.

It looks like this is a nine figure scam, so it's a pretty big deal. Apparently centralisation was one of their selling points over Bitcoin. LOL.

As far as I know there are two ways you can measure deflation, either via the monetary base or through the price. Bitcoin's monetary base is currently inflating at around 10% per year. Ok, so we can define it as inflationary in terms of the monetary base for a long period of time until the block rewards stop. 
As for price deflationary, Bitcoin *could* be called price deflationary if judged from the genesis block. But in terms of being inherently price deflationary, there's noting to guarentee that at all. Bitcoin is only price deflationary if and only if supply outstrips demand. And while that could happen, nothing inherent to Bitcoin guarantees that.
So unless you want to enlighten me on another definition of deflation it appears to me that Bitcoin can't accurately be called deflationary without a very explicit footnote or something. It could end up being price deflationary over a period of time, but again, that's not sufficient to label something deflationary from what I can tell.

They increase the money supply to match the growth of the economy and lend the money out to continue to sustain liquidity. If they didn't do that the incentive to lend money to promote growth would go down. Price deflation also can result in less spending as again there's less incentive to spend your money as it is appreciating in value as you hold it. In the short term this might sound good, but all those factors working together create a feedback effect which should result in reduced growth. So while yes increases in productivity create price deflation, not balancing it out by increasing the money supply can lead to slowed growth.

Yes, but you'll never gain enough BTC to any sort of actual commerce at all. What do you gain by having this chip in your router?
Lets assume for a moment that there is a compelling reason for your router to use bitcoin. Why this chip and not just a firmware upgrade?
One might say that the chip enables 21 Inc to siphon off 75% of your microscopic rewards from mining. But if a firmware upgrade can achieve the same function(the compelling use case, not the actual mining) with bitcoin that your getting from mining, someone will just create and open source firmware where you can load a few cents on to the wallet in the router provided by the firmware.
There's no theoretical compelling use case for Bitcoin that requires that you mine a few satoshis. It just doesn't make sense any way you look at it. And I've been trying to, but the more I think about it, the absurd it gets. 
I would love for someone from 21 Inc to come on here and tell us we're all wrong, because I haven't been this confused in a long time. I also respect Balaji and A16Z in general, so I'm still giving them the benefit of the doubt as much as I can.

Yeah, the exchangecan definitely track you through multiple channels. I mean more like only the exchange will be able track you through the blockchain. And the guy that you met up with to buy BTC from localbitcoins who looked shady won't be able to follow your coins.
It's not even remotely private really, but it's a step up from having all of your transactions connected and shown on the blockchain imo. Hopefully in the future there will be more tools to help make Bitcoin more private, because it fails miserably in that regard so far.

In the US turning USD in the BTC you might get 0-2%. But turning most local currencies in to BTC generally costs *significantly* more than that. But even so with the US example, yes, for now someone remitting money home from the US via a company that deals with BTC might be cheaper. But the main reason that might be true is that the BTC remittance company is currently unregulated and doesn't have to pay any costs related to that. 
If these Bitcoin remittance companies some how are able to stay unregulated, then that might be an edge the can exploit. But the chances of existing companies and governments turning a blind eye forever seems unlikely.
I think quick movers opening BTC remittance companies might be able to make some quick money if they can grab a portion of the market and offer a cheaper alternative. But long term I wouldn't bet on it personally. Especially with companies seemingly offering pretty good rates that are better than WU like:

I think Karpeles is an idiot though, or at least he's on the autistic spectrum which doesn't make him an idiot, but it makes him different and harder to compare. Or he's intentionally trying to play off the image of an idiot to lower suspicion.

I don't think that's good at all. I highly doubt it's the low targeted inflation that is causing inequity though and I think it's even less likely that setting it to zero or below would somehow fix inequity. Perhaps there will come a time when it will make economic sense to target a zero inflation rate, but I doubt that time is now.

Same argument could be made about Bitcoin miners though could it not? How do you prove that discus fish doesn't have most of that 20% unknown hash or whatever as well? I don't think that's the case but it would be trivial for a mining company to split up their blocks found by IP.
I don't think there's any solution to Sybil attacks anyway though. None that I know of at least. Too easy to make a new IP or whatever.

Open up your banking app on your phone and send your friend the 30 euros you owe him for drinks last night. Instantly and free.
I'm sure there are still quite a few countries that don't have this yet. But all the ones I have any connection to all do. And I'd be curious to know which countries banking systems don't offer that yet. Worst I've seen so far is a ~$0.50 flat fee for transfers between certain banks or something like that. But most of the time I've seen them it's been free.

But the effects aren't felt right away locally as peoples purchasing power doesn't change on a daily basis or anything. And in terms of wealth management people are diversified or hedged against that volatility anyway. No one is going to keep all their wealth sitting in straight Euros or especially something like Rubles.
And the value of fiat dropping also has some positive economic effects that come back over time like increased exports and multinationals coming and creating jobs and such.

Like I said in another reply here, they're a net benefit for sure, and I agree they add value. My main point is that the amount of direct demand they add of their own given the way they appear to function now is minimal at best. None of these technologies that I know thus far require much more than a few transaction fees to do what they do.
It's good for the image of Bitcoin to be seen as a useful technology. It's just that demand for the currency itself seems to be a separate issue altogether than demand for Bitcoin as a technology. Which is fine, but I'd imagine if you told someone in 2013 that in 2015 Goldman Sachs, NYSE, and NASDAQ are all going to be backing Bitcoin for its technology but the price was going to be steady at around $230 they would probably call you a buttcoin troll.
@_date: 2015-05-31 09:20:47
In the long term maybe, but in the short term they'll follow the chain that they want to follow.
If a hard fork happens and the miners on the old chain happen to get luckier and solve more blocks that doesn't mean that the exchanges are just going to abandon their intended upgrade. As long as there's an economic consensus on a chain then they'll stay on that one.

I have done research. You're the first person I've seen make such strong claims regarding anonymity and Bitcoin. Even people like Greg Maxwell and Andrew Poelstra are spending their time evaluating and developing Bitcoin compatible sidechained anonymity tech( You seem to be implying that Bitcoin in it's current state can reach a strong level of anonymity but as far as people smarter than myself are concerned current anon tech/methods used in Bitcoin such as mixing, using a third party exchange cross blockchain, stealth addresses ect are not sufficient. If the current tools are sufficient why is all this research and development going on? I'm not claiming to have the answers, but you seem to be.
@_date: 2015-01-07 11:42:45
Well, there's multisig for one. But even without that someone did some calculations that the EV of keeping multiple wallets as separate failure points was actually than the EV of keeping a single one assuming the same probability of failure for each wallet. Not sure how that worked exactly, but I think the gist of it was that the more wallets you have the more likely at least one will fail assuming the same probability of loss/failure on each. 
Either way though, a properly stored private key and cold wallet should be one of the safest ways to store value in the world. Especially if it's using BIP38.

Exactly. A lot of altcoins are fully backwards compatible with Bitcoin tech now anyway. People say that the all the infrastructure build for Bitcoin protects it but fail to mention that this infrastructure isn't Bitcoin exclusive.
And even for the ones that aren't Bitcoin compatible, coding the backend to work with another technology isn't going to be a barrier if it's profitable to do so.
People should try to try to take a more objective look at the situation.

Yeah, early adopters have unloaded on people the last couple of years and bought lots of toys. That can't last forever with out insanely high sustained demand. The point is that if BTC goes back down again people still in BTC won't have that kind of wealth anymore. Other than Satoshi and maybe a couple of whales.

Same reason you want to hold Bitcoin but without miners continuing to dump millions of dollars worth of BTC on the market.

I agree that it's not going away, but what also isn't going away is the monetary base inflation we see from mining. So we would need to clear that hurdle to have any hope of sustaining any sort of real rise in price. The higher the price the more that works against us too. It's almost self-limiting actually.

It will decrease temporarily at least until the difficulty changes. And if 99% did leave then that would be the end of Bitcoin as we know it at least. Since blocks would take days and waiting for up to ~2000 blocks could take years.
If 99% slowly and orderly left over a long period difficulty could catch up and there would be less of a problem.

@_date: 2015-01-14 16:54:51
Sounds reasonable. 
I think there might be some unexploited use case for unregulated gambling/gaming sites that have trouble moving money around. But the big problem there is that the type of customers they want gambling generally aren't the same type that's interested in Bitcoin. Maybe in Asian markets if they could buy BTC at a local shop like they do prepaid phone cards or something. Only worry is that if governments catch on to what its being used for it would be really easy to clamp down. All it would take is one news report about how people are gambling illegally by buying these cards at convenience stores and you can imagine that they would quickly do something about it.
Other than that and being a hobby/gamble itself I agree that there's been no solid use cases that have been revealed yet.
Scary thing too is that it sucks at privacy and anonymity making it a poor choice for a dark market currency. And people have developed and continue develop much better systems that would be superior. Whether or not people will actually care about privacy is another matter, who knows really.
@_date: 2015-01-31 13:33:06
More interesting question would be what countries in Europe and Asia don't have that? I bring this up a lot on this sub and so far the only people who have said that their banking system doesn't offer this are Americans and then one person from Denmark. Now I'm sure there's likely some more that don't offer it, and some that charge a small fee or whatever for instant transfers. I'm honestly curious which other countries don't have this yet. Ones I'm familiar with like Singapore, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, UK, Canada all do and I'm sure it doesn't just stop there. Think most countries in Europe have them at this point too.

@_date: 2015-01-30 10:44:20
They mean that they think the price will constantly go up because the monetary base inflation rate halves roughly every four years. In reality Bitcoin is price deflationary if and only if demand outstrips supply. And of course there is absolutely nothing to guarantee that whatsoever.
Bitcoin is monetary base inflationary through mining when viewed in any reasonable time frame.

@_date: 2015-01-13 08:01:34
Not really. The lower the price the less useful it gets due to the market being able to be moved easier. One dollar BTC would mean that there's only a ~12 or 13 million dollar market cap, which is smaller than a lot of alts that have super thin markets. 
Unless some 3rd party decided to peg it at a dollar or something and support the market that way, but that's obviously not going to happen.

Pretty sure he had up to 500,000 at one point in a wallet. For a while the whole thing was transparent. Some of that was paid back to people who got out in time though. The SEC mentioned him losing 200,000 BTC and ending up with $150,000. So it might have been 300,000 BTC paid back and 200,000 BTC stolen.

@_date: 2015-05-09 14:04:15
Because it's just such a large amount of BTC that as soon as it started moving many people would panic. I think a lot of people consider that money effectively dead and outside of the economy. It would be like if the next block mined 1,000,000 BTC instead of 25, just the idea of that kind of increase in effective supply would cause people to completely recalculate what they think the fair value for BTC is.
Maybe if there was some warning and a clear plan communicated to the community of exactly what he plans to do with his coins before he moves them, then maybe.

I thought for high value employees like coders and such having things like food available actually pays off in productivity? As well as potentially attracting quality people that have their choice of company to work for.
None of those things listed suggest wasting money to me anyway. Food, drinks, and snacks?

Back in the day when I was running BitcoinQT and leaving it running and minimized or whatever, was that counting as a node on the network automatically (assuming the blockchain was fully downloaded)? Or would I have had to specifically toggle an option to act as a node? I know I used to be able to toggle 'generate coins', which necessitates being a node, but other than that I don't remember any specifics.

Bitcoin wasn't really designed for this type of usage as far as I can tell. 
I mean, maybe we'll figure it out and come to a consensus that's going to enable scaling, but that's turning out to be easier said than done. And it seems there's *a lot* of assumption by industry backed by many millions of dollars that solving this problem is inevitable. Maybe it is, but there's also a lot of people who don't share in the vision that Bitcoin's blockchain is meant to handle massive amounts of data and/or transactions.
In all seriousness, maybe 21 Inc and other interested parties should set aside some money to fund some research in to solving this issue. It seems the future of their business(and others) depend on Bitcoin evolving beyond what it is today.

Decentralisation in general aligns with virtually every modern western political ideology that's not communism or fascist whether some people realise or not. Anarachists don't get to claim that one as their own just because they are the most extreme form of it.
Bitcoin can be whatever people want it to be. Just because it's meant to be decentralised doesn't automatically mean it's inherently anarchistic. 
And a lot of the criticism is related to the question of whether Bitcoin is better than or can replace fiat. It does lack many of the qualities that fiat lacks and it's really an entirely new different class of asset with nothing that it can be compared with.
@_date: 2015-01-16 10:10:21

All bullshit of course, but Pirate loved to egg them on since all the secrecy and speculation helped him. He would also talk about moving the market a lot in IRC(which was very likely the case considering the amount of BTC he had).

Out of all the scenarios I'd expect this one to be pretty unlikely considering all the millions of dollars and highly intelligent motivated people working on alternative digital currencies.

Pretty exciting time to be alive if you ask me.
@_date: 2015-01-14 20:28:58
Recent research suggests otherwise though. I don't think it falls nearly as short as people seem to think. It's like Polestra's informal write up about PoS made everyone just throw up their hands and say 'that's it, it's over', when in reality the debate is just beginning.

The thing is that to me the fundamentals seem weak as hell. I don't know what 'fundamentals' people are talking about when they say this but to me I think of the ~10% PA monetary base inflation that means the higher in price it goes the more millions it takes to sustain. 
Another fundamental might be a vibrant economy full of people using Bitcoin in their day to day lives. But really that hasn't happened yet. And the community is tiny really.

There's decentralised asset exchanges like NXT's AE, and decentralised asset issuers like Counterparty too.
Not sure if Counterparty has a decentralised exchange built in or not, I know you can trade their tokens on centralised exchanges though and it's been popular with good projects like Storj and Swarm.
Then there's the NXT Multigateway which is distributed and uses multisig, but technically not 100% decentralised even though it's a big step up.
Bitshares probably has some stuff too but I'm not too familiar with their tech yet.

People involved with GAW and Paycoin have no way of knowing what's going on due to the cult-like information censorship that goes on there. 
This scam is large enough(Paycoin's market cap was almost 200 million) to have residual negative effects on Bitcoin.
Lots of Bitcoin companies have been supporting the scam for a while now and it's important that people know who the bad actors are in the space. 
There's no crypto-police out there so it's important for the community to self-police and get the right information out to people to help mitigate the damage done by scams like this. 
TL;DR it's probably one of the largest scams in crypto history, not quite Gox level, but big enough to really matter.

@_date: 2015-01-15 11:41:48
But in this case the hoarders need to provide a constant supply of fiat to meet the demand of BTC that's being produced. And the higher the price goes the more fiat it takes to sustain the price. So while speculative demand might be able to sustain a certain price level, over the long run I'd say it's much more likely Bitcoin would grow via an actual, non-speculative based economy with real life use cases for BTC. Not just playing the greater fool game.
With USD people have incentives to spend it. So far there hasn't yet been very many solid incentives for people to buy BTC to use it. But that might change as things continue to develop. Just sitting on it and hoping enough people speculate on it to meet the ~10% monetary inflation that's going on right now seems like a worse plan than trying to create actual economic value out of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-01-16 15:08:59
There isn't. The risk is that BTS crashes and the margin that backs the bitUSD gets called. Still a risk, but at least it's a decentralised crypto risk.
@_date: 2015-01-01 18:06:47
Considering the potential tax implications and the cost of having accountants and lawyers look in to the implications of that I highly doubt it. 
Not to mention the costs involved with training people to properly secure the BTC to hold.
Bitcoin has a pretty huge overhead cost associated with it when used for any other fuction than a USD payment provider. That doesn't mean it's useless, but people should also acknowledge that and think of ways to help mitigate those costs as they are another barrier to adoption. As much as I'm not a fan of (bad)regulation, it's likely that regulation will lower that overhead quite a bit for business.
If they did do that though I would be impressed. I guess Microsoft can afford it so maybe they do.
@_date: 2015-01-06 18:27:23

If all of that hardware is there and now under the control of a centralised party like the Chinese government it would be difficult to match that level of hash power I think. There are a lot of miners outside China, but one of the big issues is that I think most if not all of the ASICs and boards are manufactured there. Although I'm not sure on that, but from what I've seen they all seem to come from China.
If the Chinese government just shut it all down, that wouldn't be that big of a deal, other than lowering the security of the blockchain. But if they actually took it over and used it that would be pretty bad. That's a big if of course, and I definitely don't think it's likely at all that something like that is going to happen anytime soon.

@_date: 2015-05-21 10:36:40
Yesterday when we were discussing 21's revealed ideas, I was making a criticism about how the ratio between consumer mined coins and the 10k satoshi fee as well as the miner enforced ~547 satoshi minimum seem at odds with their plans. But someone pointed out to me that they'll be able mine their own blocks that can include no minimum size and no transaction fee to transactions broadcasted from their chips. 
That makes sense to me. But if we're talking incentives, then that now establishes a clear incentive for 21 Inc themselves to mine as many blocks as possible, so that they can include all their customers microtransactions at no cost. The higher their hashrate, the quicker they will solve blocks on average, which would also confirm all of their chip broadcasted transactions faster as well.
I do believe that Balaji understands the core philosophy of what makes Bitcoin work. But he's just one person who has to answer to board members and investors. If we ever reach a point that 21 Inc has to make a choice between profits and and upholding decentralisation it will be quite interesting to see how that unfolds. They would want to maximize their take, while mining as high of a percentage of blocks as possible without mining so many that it causes a proportional loss in the BTC exchange value to offset profits. But what percentage is that? We don't know, but people might end up being pretty comfortable with a company like 21 Inc holding a dominating position. We don't really know how it will work out. They and their associates have the money to influence the only consensus that matters though in the end, the economic consensus.

Wow, Bitcoin has a much better value proposition for Americans if that's the case then. It's often hard to give people a good reason why they should use Bitcoin in a country that already has a good p2p system, but without one it's a much easier sell. (This is actually good news :P)

I think some Bitcoin remittance companies that focus on local markets like the Phillipines might be able to make some money for a few years while there's a gap in the market or something. But long term there is next to no chance I think that Bitcoin can compete with a centralised company on cost. That is unless by some miracle Bitcoin becomes the most widely used and liquid currency in the world, in which case it would work fine for that.

Hmm, In my mind that was more of the normal ebb and flow of Bitcoin. I'm thinking more of when the media really picks it up and tons of new people come in to Bitcoin and the price skyrockets quickly similar to the way it did in 2011 and twice in 2013.

I think it's common knowledge that the economic consensus is the one that really matters. The fiat gateways like Circle and Coinbase really have the strongest say about which blockchain they prefer. As long as their chosen blockchain has a minimum amount of mining going on, making the cost of attacking high enough that it disincentivizes would be attackers, then their choice is the one that matters.
We could have a fork that adds some incredible features and improves Bitcoin tremendously, but if the fork has no big fiat gateway supporters, then it's DOA. Buying and selling BTC is obviously the most important part of sustaining the economy.

Demand for BTC is necessary. Restricting supply is only part of the equation. 
If no one uses BTC, and there's no reason for services to be built around it, then there's no demand.
And without demand there's no liquidity, no utility. Bitcoin just becomes a game of greater fool between 'hoarders'.

It's more like they mean, 'Bitcoin *as a currency* bad, Bitcoin's blockchain(that happens to be the most secure blockchain around right now) good. 
There's some minimum viable level of blockchain security that needs to be met in order for it to make sense to use a blockchain as a ledger. It seems lots of people don't see the value in using Bitcoin as a currency, but see the value in exploiting its blockchain to build technology on top of. If it's not Bitcoin, it will just be something else that meets the risk vs reward security criteria for attackers.
It's almost like a free rider problem*. Bitcoin's blockchain is like a public good that can be used by anyone with an extremely low cost of entry(literally pennies per transaction).
Now we've reached an interesting point where the wider world is seeing all kinds of utility and value in blockchain technology(which will mean Bitcoin's blockchain at least for now since it's the strongest), but no value in Bitcoin as a currency. Bitcoin only has to hold *some* value, enough for there to be an incentive for people to be mining it at a reasonable rate to keep attacks expensive enough. So we're still stuck with the same problem of bitcoin the currency having very few real world use cases that offer value over alternatives. Or more precisely, Bitcoin in amounts greater than transaction fees doesn't offer much utility or value yet.
I think the best chance for increased interest in bitcoin the currency is if those bitcoin ETFs become a speculative toy for Wall St. to add to their collection. Other than that people really need to think of a way to really get an internal, closed loop bitcoin economy going generating real value and offering good use cases for the currency over traditional methods.
\* It's not really a *problem*, but people definitely seem to be annoyed at how hot 'blockchain technology' is now while demand for BTC has faltered since 2013.
@_date: 2015-05-25 07:08:42


Yeah, that's one of the biggest advantages we have. We can frictionlessly move billions in value wherever it needs to be. No need to fear the future if you're already here and agile.


Most people I respect dismiss it due to the lead dev deceptively 'instamining' two million coins(around 33% of the supply?) in the first two days while launching it early and not making a windows wallet available.
I don't see any point in trying to make it work. And even if it were the best anonymity tech(which I'm under the impression it's not), this would be a prime example of when a fork would benefit everyone and clean the slate.
That and since it's based on Bitcoin Core, the tools could be added to Bitcoin itself.

I don't think too many people would have predicted that demand for the blockchain itself would over shadow demand for the currency. Many people here seem to think the two are intertwined, but they're not really. That could change in the future somehow though.
You're right that there just hasn't been much demand for bitcoin generated by consumers or business. But a lot of the infrastructure being built now seems to be aimed at taking advantage of the utility of the blockchain. And that's not bad at all, but I still think it's surprising at just how in love with 'blockchain technology' everyone is.

I'm sure there will be a number of companies who comply with the Bitlicence, they just have to be well funded.
Maybe the Bitlicence is going to do damage to some, but I highly doubt it was written in the spirit of stopping Bitcoin.

But if BTC is 10x then fees are also going to be 10x unless they scale them back. They already kind of had to do this when we were over $1000. And it was a problem for a while when wallets like Electrum were forcing people to pay 0.0002 each tx which was around $0.25 when I was complaining about it. 
Higher fees will limit the transactions. It should theoretically work out to some equilibrium eventually though.

This has been a huge problem over the years for Bitcoin. Even now a large number of people in the community feel deceived over the dismissive attitude over the ability for Bitcoin to scale.

What are your thoughts on the economics of being a Lightning hub(are they called hubs?)? I've read on here that it takes an enormous amount of money to run one and that money has to be locked up. Any decent volume requires an equal amount of money in holding? This might be a misconception, I'm not sure.
@_date: 2015-08-23 19:27:33
Yes, I do understand that part. I just think that Bitcoin having a high or rising price is a necessary condition to them having any sort of profitable exit with these Bitcoin based companies. Which adds another variable to their profitability equation which isn't easy to overcome.
The VC funds being specifically intended for VC alone is a good point. They would probably have to take some extraordinary measures to use fund money for something outside VC. Maybe something like a spin off hedge fund seeded with VC money with full agreement from partners and investors. 
The ROI being lower investing in Bitcoin compared to what they would make from exits on successful Bitcoin companies is correct, but I think in order to actually make that ROI Bitcoin itself will have to grow in value. So I think ideally they would just become more selective in funding better Bitcoin projects, while using all the surplus capital that they appear to be wasting on poor ideas to accumulate BTC(assuming they could figure out a way to do this).

Yeah. But any math I've seen on how fees contribute to the network has been abysmal based on the lowish fees we see today. A million transactions with fees really doesn't exactly offer miners *that* much. And combine the the fact that they can load up a very large amount of transaction outputs in one transaction like faucets do, and consider the fact that blockchain bloat is a continued issue, it doesn't look good.
If anything this whole blockchain-as-a-database thing is looking more like a tragedy of the commons situation if it's really exploited to its full potential.
And that's not even considering point about all the extra potential value coming on without the related security increases that result from direct price raise in the actual BTC token.

Okay, but my main point is that research continues in to both Peercoin and NXT. The initial whitepapers are just a start. Blackcoin I don't know about.


In terms of sybil resistance with PoW having the most, in theory DPoS should have some amount of resistance since the idea behind it is that stakeholders are voting in delegates who produce some measurable output of value to the system. Meaning the should be some cost to obtaining multiple delegate positions under a single entities control. It's much more subjective in that way than PoW though, yes. And it's probably the biggest issue that I've seen raised so far based on my limited reading. Like I said before I'm not particularly familiar with Bitshares in general though.


I put that there as a way to acknowledge that there might be some good criticism that I haven't seen. And that I'm more than happy to see some arguments against it.
If anything my main disappointment comes from the general lack of criticism on the continued research. I'm not making any claims at all the a fully robust PoS system exists, but I'm not convinced that it's impossible. 
Clearly there's still a lot of research being done in the area by qualified people:  
How many people other than Vitalik are actively reviewing and criticizing? Poelstra almost did take the time to, but wasn't able to align his schedule to meet with Chepurnoy. I wish more people would criticize the Consensus Research group's work and any other research being done in the area. Just them doing things like trying to establish formal definitions for things like the NaS attack and PoS systems is a good step forward for future debate and research. I'd be quite happy if qualified people would come and tear down their research completely and I'm disappointed that I don't see more of that.
I'm not an expert, but I do want to see more research and debate between experts so things can continue to move forward.

I've read on here a few times that lack of regulatory guidance has made some companies wearing of dealing with Bitcoin.

I'm not an anti-Blockstream person at all, but I have to admit I've found this behavior extremely puzzling. I definitely wouldn't have expected a reaction like this. Warning about what would happen with a consensus break down on one hand, while doing the things you mention on the other that appear to be done with the intention of inciting a break down in consensus.

This isn't my experience in the SEA region *at all*. Banking system is pretty modern and I see all kinds of resources for SMEs. If someone has more direct experience with SME resources contradicting what I'm saying I'm more than happy to concede that. But most people(especially Americans) are shocked at how much better banking is in SEA.
What they should be doing is traveling to the US to wake up the banks there to get with this centuries banking system of instant, free(often, not always), domestic(and sometimes inter region Maylasia &lt;-&gt; Singapore for example) interbank transfers.
edit: UK is one of the places with an advanced banking system though too. Free instant interbank transfers are standard. So it could be better than SEA's systems, but with Singapore being the financial center and such I really can't see them being too far ahead. Unless they're talking about going to Myanmar, Cambodia, and Laos specifically.

I don't know if there is any connection to social contract theory in philosophy. I'm saying that there are many people in the Bitcoin community who believe that there is some sort of social contract that governs what changes should and shouldn't be made to the Bitcoin protocol. The 'social contract' is mentioned quite often by people as something that defines Bitcoin. The most common element being that there can only ever be 21 million BTC and changing that number at any point would break the imagined social contact that many believe exists.

I mean, kushti is soon to be a PhD computer scientist if he's not already, and him and his group are making the claim backed up by their research and simulation that long range attacks like the one Peter mentioned in the video aren't possible in the system they've defined.
That's a pretty big claim and should have some pretty major implications on future research if true. I'm not making any claims of its truth either way.

There are at least a couple projects working on atomic transfers between blockchains. And I believe CIYAM has already succeeded with the first inter-blockchain atomic transfer. Although when CIYAM himself had a conversation with Gavin about it Gavin expressed concern over what would happen if there was a blockchain reorg. So I don't think it's on the agenda to be added to Bitcoin any time soon.
Another project too:

That is very true that the darknet markets provide a real use case and real demand. But I remember reading a study that examined what the price of BTC would be if it was only used for darknet stuff, ignoring other economic activity, and it was not very high at all.
Would love to see some updated analysis of how much demand the darknet markets contribute now. I think it's still a small minority of the overall economic activity. With speculation almost certainly being the large majority at this point. 
@_date: 2015-08-21 19:55:58
I'm not positive, but I know they have a token issued so you probably do.
Is that a deal breaker for you? I don't see anything inherently wrong with it personally. I can imagine myself sending a few bucks in BTC through shapeshift or something to purchase some storage space. Or maybe they'll offer a service that you send BTC to and it directly autoconverts it for you and  you don't even have to take an additional step. Things like the fluid movement between different assets are one of the best advantages of cryptocurrency imo. With sidechains and other systems like atomic inter-blockchain transfers on the horizon this type of exchange that goes on behind the scenes is likely to become standard for all kinds of services and tech. Bitcoin itself is never going to offer any of these specialized services, but it can certainly be exchanged in to whatever is needed to take advantage of them.

It wouldn't be the cheapest option on the planet. I assume you must live in the US because in many countries in Europe and Asia people get free instant p2p domestic transfers, and it's becoming more common now to expand that to free instant p2p transfers between countries in the region.
For international transfers it might have some niche if you can find low spread options on both ends of the transfer to change money back to fiat. But that barely exists now, maybe between the US and the UK or something. But even for big transfers a wire transfer with a $30 fee is going to beat out BTC since the higher the transfer goes the more you lose on the spread.

I see the logic in that stance, but I also think that quite a lot is resting on LN working out. Not only working out, but working out in time and hoping some alternative doesn't come down and swoop up a lot of commerce in the meantime.

If you have a dynamic IP turn off your modem for 10 seconds and then turn it back on and you'll probably get assigned a different IP. Dynamic IPs are pretty common in my experience so there's a decent chance this is what you have unless you specifically pay for a static IP(which is possible).

Yes, I would predict that would be the case too. But I also think that he wouldn't merge it if both Jeff and Gavin opposed it. I could be wrong here of course, and like you said also, I don't want to put words in this mouth. But that's my impression thus far anyway.

Yes, makes it kind of hard to sell someone who already uses a banking app on their device. Especially when their bank offers free transfers. Which isn't always the case, but surprisingly common in my experience. And if not free it's pretty cheap.

Many people have been explicitly told over the years that it would be trivial to scale Bitcoin when the time comes.

That sounds more like something that would happen if there was a robust PoS system[1] rather than the current one. I don't see how your scenario results in everyone suddenly wanting to buy mining equipment and pushing the cost of 50% of the hashrate in to the trillions. But that math sounds plausible at least if we're talking about the government trying to buy 50% of the total supply of a currency itself.

So many bad Bitcoin startups have been funded that I can't imagine why they just didn't put most of that money directly in to Bitcoin, and save the funding for the cream of the crop. I know they like to play the numbers game, and it only takes a few hits to come out on top. But Bitcoin is different, the price of Bitcoin directly affects the economic activity as well as the robustness of its security. I don't think approaching it in the same way they approach the standard startup to IPO exit is necessarily optimal. It seems they were really bullish on Bitcoin in general, but all you really need to do to get exposed to Bitcoin is buy some, and the act of buying them also creates a positive feedback loop by increasing demand, which in turn increases demand since there's a limited supply.
Someone might say, 'how do you know they haven't put a similar amount of money directly in to BTC?'. And I can't say for sure that they haven't of course, but on the other hand I highly doubt Silicon Valley has pumped over a billion dollars in to BTC. I think they probably should have though. And I'm not saying this as someone who's underwater on BTC and just looking to pass the buck(I'm not). I honestly think that Bitcoin relies on a significant amount of buying and holding for it to reach any further levels of success. There's been a lot of effort wasted in the last couple of years in my opinion trying to fit Bitcoin in to every space, including those where it holds little to no inherent advantage.

The first part of your sentence makes sense to me, but doesn't really jive with the second part about him selling it for $600. Since it implies that he recognizes the value and is happy to wait till it doubles to cash out. 
If he immediately sold it because he think's there's a good chance the whole thing is a scam and it might be worthless any minute, then yeah.

That would be interesting. I've gotten the impression over time that Circle hasn't been too happy with Bitcoin or the community itself(probably rightfully so too).

It would almost be like a hedge for Circle, since they're already fully on the Bitcoin train, so if it didn't work out they'd only lose whatever they put in to making their own project.

That's not true despite the sub being filled with a large amount of crazy people often drowning everyone else out.
Out of curiosity, does also ban discussion on gold or other PMs? If so then I think banning cryptocurrency discussion is kind of consistent with that, since they're some what similar investments and both attract a lot of crazy people. The downside to that is there is still a lot of new research being done in the cryptocurrency field that might be relevant that also gets ignored like pegged assets, decentralised asset exchanges and things like that. But all out ban is the easier way.

Yeah, I mostly agree and don't think they're going to see much ROI anytime soon either unless there's some kind of event that creates a lot of demand for Bitcoin. If they were able to use the fund money to buy BTC(which I understand they can't just do in most cases) it *might* give them a chance to make some profitable exits. If they had known that one of the only chances for them to make a decent ROI was to support the BTC price themselves they might have just passed all together, but I can't think of too many ways that they're going to make their money back short of lightning striking BTC again like it did in 2013. 
I don't want to sound too negative, I think BTC still has a chance of getting another bubble on its own, but I don't think any of these companies are going to be what makes something like that happen, and I know the VCs won't even blink and just move on to the next fad. But I really do think(even if it's entirely unrealistic and never going to happen) that if a few big SV people got together, even privately, to make some sort of last ditch effort, they could probably create enough momentum to allow them to get a decent exit with some of those companies.

If I had to choose one of the proposed options so far I'd just choose Garzik's 2mb compromise and then wait a year to see how LN works out. Hopefully it does and that would be the last hard fork for any block size related issue. 4mb would be probably be alright too. One year from now we'll just have so much more knowledge and data, and it should be easier to make a decision on whether or not large block increases will be needed or not.
I do think that if it starts to regularly cost more than $0.25 to get a transaction included in a timely manner then there will be some people deciding to use an alternative chain for smaller transactions. But it's probably not going to happen right away, there's still a good amount of room left on blocks so that fees should stay around what they are now for a little while I think.

Might have to move away from SHA256 too if the Chinese government co-opted all that hardware for themselves to use against the network.

All evidence seems to point to the contrary so far. What people are talking about simply has little to nothing to do with Bitcoin. Bitcoin has inspired many derivative ideas, but these resulting ideas are so different than Bitcoin itself that they're not in the same category.
Liquidity is irrelevant in most of these cases as there's generally no need for any sort of token or currency. And security should be equivalent to how well each agent in the distributed consensus mechanism can secure their keys. And despite the amount of loss we've seen with people losing their BTC over the years, I personally believe that the signing on a cold machine paradigm is extremely secure and given even minimum attention to reasonable practices should result in a secure blockchain without the need to worry about outside attacks on other aspects of the system.

I pretty much agree with everything here except the idea that the Blockstream employees/founders are somehow choosing Blockstream over more lucrative alternatives. Now we don't know any details at all about their individual deals with Blockstream, but keep in mind that they're founders to a startup that has a first round of 21 million in funding. That alone is pretty huge. Their immediate compensation packages must be fairly substantial to begin with. And then they've mentioned that they have longer term bitcoin denominated compensation as well. And then we have to consider that it's very likely that they also have equity as well.
I don't think it will be particularly hard for the company to generate revenue from consulting with their roster. If that's the path they choose in the short term. And even if they don't, the technology that they're working on now is still so speculative and chock full of potential that there are probably tons of VCs that are knocking on their door wanting to get in for further rounds of funding. Look at how much money has been thrown at 21 Inc.
So the only notion that I disagree with here in terms of Blockstream is the idea that these people are somehow passing up greater, more lucrative opportunities to work at Blockstream. I don't believe that at all. Considering who they are, this is *the* financial opportunity for them. A company that specializes in exactly what they've been focusing their lives on for the last n years. And a company that has all the right financing and connections to really capitalize on those skills. It probably just so happens that what they actually want to work on is also what offers them the highest earning potential.
I should add that what I'm talking about here isn't meant to imply at all that they are shaping their opinions on the block size issue around what they think will be profitable for them. I don't think that at all. I just think Blockstream as a company has lots of growth potential either way. And that the block size issue is pretty inconsequential to their profitability potential unless it causes some of the Blockstreamers to just quit cryptocurrency altogether.

They could fork it if they have consensus between the participants to fork it. Just like we could with Bitcoin. The point is distributed consensus among participants. 
Yes, there wouldn't be any value transferred in the system. But the result of the consensus would dictate who settles what with whom off chain.
The private keys should easily be secured using the same paradigm we use to secure our Bitcoin keys. Offline devices used to sign. It should be extremely secure given any level of basic competency.

Well with someone like Wikipedia there could be a few different reasons. They apparently need peoples information for some reporting requirement, ie your name and such. And when you donate Bitcoin people unsurprisingly don't want to put their info down so that could often result in two scenarios: first one being the person simply gives up and doesn't donate which would show up on their stats, or the other thing could be them putting blatantly fake information which someone who handles their reporting might take issue with because they believe that it could cause them problems.
Also a more simple explanation is that the cost/reward ratio of handling Bitcoin wasn't paying off(maybe not this if they used Bitpay or something and just converted to USD). Or perhaps they A/B test donations with and without Bitcoin and they found it was higher without. Just saying I'm not surprised because there could be a whole slew of reasons for them to drop it, not that I want them to drop it or anything. But the trying to cover it up thing is really weird and I don't get that part at all.

If I had to choose one proposal I'd choose your BIP102. I don't know why that hasn't gotten much attention. A year from now we can reevaluate the landscape with regard to how things like LN and sidechains have worked out. Maybe there won't even need to be another fork. But if it's clear that the blocksize will need to be raised then there should be much less contention at that point since there will be so much more data to go off of.

The technology would be the trustless trading of the tokens that cannot be seized. That is not the same as a centralised exchange, and I think it's clearly a step up. Even if fiat gateways are necessary. And there are a lot of different ways it could go depending on how different companies want to set it up. If the tokens could be treated like cash then it would be even better. I know there's already some companies in the Bitcoin space trying to do this. Tether is one that I've heard of, I don't know the details of how they handle their fiat denominated tokens though.

I don't think it's possible to both require industrial strength electricity(to put it mildly) and keep free of government involvement in a country with a government like China.
I think the reality is that right now everything rests at the whims of Chinese government. They could easily decide to co-opt that hash power for their own purposes if they saw fit. So far they don't seem to have much incentive to notice or care much about the Bitcoin network. But give them the slightest reason to, and they could easily control the majority of hash power on the network. And not simply in the theoretical way that's always existed of 'any state could spend hundreds of millions of dollars building farms to attack Bitcoin', but in a more realistic scenario since they literally already have the hash power working within their borders. They may only be communist in name, but I wouldn't doubt they'd nationalize something like mining if they thought they had something to gain from doing so.
I'm not saying this is necessarily likely to happen any time soon, but it's probably one of the most understated issues in all of Bitcoin. The only response I can think of  if the Chinese government made a move would be to hard fork to a new PoW algo as soon as possible. Hopefully that doesn't have to happen though. And I don't think trying to fight them head on by scaling up mining outside of China is a fight that could be won.

Yes, you could also classify a blockchain as a database too probably. But you can use the blockchain as Bitcoin as implemented it in ways other than just Bitcoin. It's the distributed consensus, distributed data, cryptographically secure signing of blocks, and immutability(debatable depending on the implementation) that is driving people to think of new applications using a blockchain, or something can provide similar characteristics. The blockchain just happens to exist now in an easily usable and forkable form to experiment with.

I'm thinking that the community won't accept it, but people who aren't in the community might accept other blockchains that are presented to them from 'trusted' sources. So part of the reason why I think that it won't necessarily be a bad thing is that all these alternatives might just end up introducing people to the concept in general, and add rather than take away value/users. Pretty vague, but there's so many different ways that all of this is going to unfold that it's definitely going to be interesting to see how it all plays out.

Yes as I said an n of m scheme would be used over PoW since there's no point. They can trust each other and still desire a distributed consensus, no? Blockchains exist now that can provide that, other systems that don't use the blockchain data structure will likely be built or are already built.

They might have underestimated the difficulty expansion in 2013 though too. I know many people who did and didn't think that it would scale so steeply. China came on the scene and demolished the competition for the most part save for a few.

How is it logical to apply a term that's already been defined and commonly known to represent cryptocurrencies with their own genesis blocks? People are trying to redefine the word, widening its definition and trying to make it a general term for a range of situations. 
XT would be more accurately called something like a Bitcoin candidate. If it doesn't get accepted you could call it a rejected Bitcoin candidate. And if it gets accepted then it just becomes Bitcoin. At no point is the intention behind XT to become anything resembling the established meaning of the word altcoin. 
Someone might take XT and make their own genesis block. That would be an altcoin. Wouldn't be surprised if someone's already done this.

It's not supposed to be trustless. Imagine 10 banks who already trust each other all share a distributed ledger or perhaps blockchain if that ends up the best idea. Blocks are signed with an n of m scheme. Used for distributed consensus on data only, no token or currency necessary.

Being able to control your own private keys that correspond to fiat is a step forward imo. Using this type of tech people should be able to build decentralised exchanges, which would be a step up from what we deal with now. Yes, when it comes down to it fiat will always rely on a gateway to be redeemed, but being able to hold your own private keys to those tokens rather than say Mt.Gox holding them is a clear step forward I think.

It is interesting that theoretically some outside influence could probably do a good job of halting any sort of progress. Not that I think this is happening here and now, but the general idea of no contentious hard forks, even if the logic behind it is sound, also gives a clear path of attack.
I'm not sure if Wlad would merge something with 1 out of 5 strongly opposed to the change. But I'm guessing he wouldn't merge something with 2 of 5 strongly opposed. I could be wrong here though of course. But if that's true then out of all the different attacks on Bitcoin ones like that which exploit social angles rather than the technical ones are probably pretty effective. And I'm not even necessarily thinking government here either, putting someone under duress is not exactly out of reach for a sufficiently motivated party. 
Just things to think about for the future. Not an issue for now, but there are a lot of questions about how exactly this whole thing should function going forward. When it comes down to it Bitcoin can always be forked, but I could see some group who didn't have Bitcoin's best interests at heart attempting to slow it down or derail its progress this way. And that's not at all meant to be a reference to Blockstream in case you're wondering, I think they're the opposite of that.

Well, they were a disaster for decentralistion and Satoshi didn't foresee them originally. They were totally inevitable though. And we've had a lot of problems or close calls with big mining pools so far(deepbit, BTCGuild(handled well), ghash.io). Not that those situations came close to killing Bitcoin or anything, but it made it painfully clear that mining tends toward centralistion unless measures are taken.
If mining pools weren't possible it would be a big victory for decentralistion, but that's not realistic I guess.

BIP 101, Bitcoin Improvement Plan 101 which specifies changes to the Bitcoin protocol meant to be used on the Bitcoin blockchain is somehow an altcoin? That's just being intellectually dishonest and deceptive. You and I both know that the term altcoin has a specific meaning that's been established in this community since 2011. This is not an altcoin, period. Using that term to try to justify deletions is unbelievably underhanded.
I don't have a side in this debate, and if anything I tend towards conservative options. But this censorship is beyond anything I could have ever imagined.
Sipa's proposed BIP also specifies a block size increase: 
Is that also considered an altcoin under this new policy?
You have to see how ridiculous this is. I mean the ability for the protocol to change over time is absolutely a fundamental part of what Bitcoin is. Whether or not this specific change is good, or will even get close to the amount of support necessary is irrelevant really. How can you possibly justify this sort of censorship?

Satoshi's genius with Bitcoin wasn't inventing all the individual parts. Each element was an already established technology. Now that Bitcoin is 6 years old and has proven itself reliable and stable people start to get inspired and think of new applications for similar technology.
Putting together distributed consensus, distributed data, cryptographically secure signing, and immutability(arguable depending on implementation) appears to offer people in the financial services industry utility. From what I'm told the banking industry to this day still has significant reliance on COBOL based mainframe systems.

Yes, with Bitcoin's delayed adjustment algorithm it's a pretty big potential danger if there was ever a reason for a lot of hashpower to drop out. Not really worried about it, but it's probably something a lot of people don't consider. If the difficulty was adjusted high and then a large hashrate drop occurred it could be hours between blocks and months between the next difficulty adjustment. 
It has happened in the altcoin world a lot. No one can viably run Bitcoin's 2 week adjustment algo since hashrate moves around so much. They'll just end up with a stuck blockchain. Luckily for Bitcoin no one has anything else to mine SHA256 that would be much more profitable than mining Bitcoin itself though.

If I'm supposed to defer to the experts on this issue then it appears that Bitcoin simply doesn't scale. Despite constant assurances over the last 4 years that it does in fact scale.
I don't know what to think, and still don't have a 'side'. But I don't feel that people who think that if this is the reality of Bitcoin, it just isn't worth it, are crazy or anything. This would mean everything for Bitcoin's future now rides on sidechains and/or Lightning. Personally I'm fine with moving to other technologies, and I know that's not a popular opinion here, but if this is the reality then the odds that Bitcoin gets usurped are far higher than they were a few months ago.
That new technology that takes over might very well be a Bitcoin sidechain while it incubates though. Assuming that all works out as expected. Mining is already semi-centralised in China now anyway, so while Bitcoin may be the most secure in a vacuum in terms of cost of attack, it's probably more vulnerable to government take down then even some altcoins. Which is kind of sad actually.
Meh, I don't know how to feel. Kind of disappointed on one hand that this is supposedly the technical reality, and kind of wouldn't mind seeing the world burn with bigger blocks taking over just to see how it actually plays out from a technical perspective. If mining further centralised in China I'm not even sure it would effectively change anything since they already have ~60% apparently, ie more than the required 50% needed. And the Chinese government is no joke. Luckily they aren't too concerned with Bitcoin right now it seems. But is there even any chance at all Bitcoin mining gets re-decentralised? What scenario exists where the Chinese become less competitive ?

I wonder if we're already past the point of no return with mining already. The number that keeps being thrown around is 60% of hashing being in China now, which with their government is not a very good position to be in.
Not sure how realistic it will be to see that trend reverse any time soon. It's possible of course, but I think there are only a few non-Chinese mining farms that really have the potential to take back their share. And competing with China on costs is a tall order.

I'd say any 2009 address that mined 50 BTC and still has it sitting there would be pretty good evidence. Not 100%, but signing a 2009 address with 50 BTC that were mined and never moved is something very few people in this world can do. It would definitely narrow it down a lot at the very least.

There are people who believe that without an adequate block reward the network security will regress leaving Bitcoin more and more vulnerable over time. A lot of this has to do with the calculations on fee-only income for miners looking bleak unless fees and transaction numbers are both very high. So some small perpetual block reward as incentive is not an unheard of position. 
Not saying that's my personal position. But don't be surprised if you hear it coming up more and more over years. I have read some reasonable arguments, but the 21 is a sacred number to many people so it's going to be even more contentious than this block size stuff. If by consensus you mean a majority of people right now are committed to the 21 cap then yes I definitely agree with that. This other debate isn't going to start until 2020 at the earliest, since only then will the block rewards start getting really small, and if the price isn't high enough and miners pull back then people will use something like that as evidence for change.

Their idea of the best parts of Bitcoin doesn't include the currency itself though.
It's possible that we'll see some organizations issuing digital currency or even centralised/distributed crypocurrency at some point. But I think so far most of the hype is around tokenless permissioned distributed ledgers.
And of course there's gotta be some marketing execs noticing that making a big fuss about this stuff gets press coverage too. So yeah, to some extent there's probably some wanting to stay relevant and portray a progressive image. But I also think there's some substance and potential behind a lot of these ideas.

Bitcoin does have big inflation in both price since 2013 and also the 9% monetary base inflation as you said. But when they talk about Brazil's inflation hitting 12 year highs they're almost certainly referring to price inflation rather than how much their central bank is expanding their money supply. Not that their central bank isn't inflating their money supply, they must be, but it's a totally separate measurement.

You don't care because you're fridge doesn't really have any money like it would if it was using bitcoin. It just has access to your Amazon account from which it can order you things if you allow it to.
Yes, if there are situations where two devices have to do some sort trustless negotiation then maybe Bitcoin will be good for that. I'm not sure how much demand there will be for that. I do think there will be a lot of demand for your fridge ordering you more milk or eggs without you having to go to the store though. And that's most likely just going to use accounts that already have credit cards attached to them imo.
At least that's the way I'm seeing it go. This is all just speculation of course.
@_date: 2015-08-06 12:02:23
Yes, but you don't need to necessarily use PoW to reach consensus. Distributed consensus by a group of banks signing off on blocks via some sort of n of m scheme could work. It's just different than Bitcoin and not really comparable. No inherent reason that a blockchain couldn't be used for alternative purposes. Perhaps some of the fintech companies will come up with better implementations soon and the blockchain will have only served its purpose to spark peoples imagination and get them thinking about improving their old systems.
Nothing individually about the blockhain is new, but Bitcoin's application of it is making people consider novel ways to use it. Someone could fork Git and implement it as something similar. Maybe someone will do that, but for now people are experimenting with the blockchain since it exists in a usable form and takes little effort to fork and modify.

If you start to run the numbers on transaction fees you'll notice that unless they're putting an astronomical amount of transactions on the blockchain(which is a whole other can of worms as we know), even millions of transactions really add very little economic benefit. That is unless our fee structure changes somehow. But doing that also makes the blockchain as a database thing less attractive.

@_date: 2015-08-06 14:40:41
I'm sure there are other ways of doing it other than in blocks. But it's exactly like you said, bundle up the data and write it to the database.  Blocks just seem like a convenient way to put that data in a package and have the required number of people sign off on it to acknowledge its validity. Like a distributed time stamping system. Again, I'm not saying that using a blockchain is the only or even the best way to do this stuff necessarily. But it's a valid method as I see it.
The companies that can improve upon the blockchain and offer better, more efficient systems will likely make a ton of money. I'm guessing it was a problem that they didn't think they had until they saw the potential for distributed consensus through observing Bitcoin. The American interbank transferring system is like a fossil from the last century with people having to wait days for money to clear. If banks decide to get together and start using better technology to reduce that settlement time then that can only be a good thing, whether it's a blockchain or not. 
@_date: 2015-08-13 15:34:57
Why not though? If some legitimately better technology comes our way wouldn't that be a good thing? And as a Bitcoiner you'd be first in line to actually be an early adopter. There's nothing to stop you from turning your BTC in to another cryptocurrency, while as we know turning fiat in to crypto is sometimes quite difficult depending on where you are and other factors. Bitcoin might just be the first step towards something greater, we don't really know yet but at least we have the freedom to decide.

Yes, that's the common response, and I agree that Git contains the desired characteristics as I was saying in the other thread I linked. But it would still need to be forked and customized. No PoW needed for these purposed for either repurposed blockchain or repurposed Git.
I'm not sure but signing off on blocks rather than mining them with PoW sounds very similar to how I think DelegatedPoS works now. They could probably just fork one of those projects. 
@_date: 2015-07-17 15:21:36
It's not a solution, but think of how much more information we'll have next year to really take a better look at what needs to happen for Bitcoin scaling in the future. If Lightning is looking promising and Sidechains are working well, there might not need to be another hard fork at all. And if none of the promised solutions materialized, then the debate will be much more focused on the nitty gritty technical details rather than hypothetical solutions.

Without PoW a blockchain is just a blockchain. With Bitcoin as a mining incentive and PoW Bitcoin is just Bitcoin.
The two concepts are not inseparable at all, they just happen to be completely different systems that share very little in common other than using a common data structure. There are many different ways you could configure a system to work to different levels of specification while using a blockchain without PoW. They just wouldn't bare any resemblance to Bitcoin itself.

Right now with fiat, it might not be ready. But fiat redeemable crypto tokens should be more prevalent in the future. There are people coming at it from different angles, some psudocentralised solutions, and maybe even a little interest from established banks and such. Nothing certain yet though.
Until someone could spend a fiat token iteslf somewhere there will always have to be a fiat gateway if you want real cash. But having crypto fiat tokens that you can control yourself should be a good first step up from what we have now and good progress towards decentralised exchanges.
Ideally you would never have to store your keys with anyone but your self to use an exchange.
@_date: 2015-08-20 14:20:27
No one specific company, but having to go fiat -&gt; BTC and then BTC -&gt; fiat again having to eat the spread twice makes it hard. Even in a specialized remittance channel like US to the Philippines like we see that one company doing with Bitcoin today they still only barely beat out companies like transferwise, xoom, and even WU. That's including the fact that buying BTC in the US through something like Circle or Coinbase is probably going to be on of the lowest spread options. But sending remittance from somewhere other than the US where you have to buy BTC on Localbitcoins or something similar is going to result in a much wider spread and probably won't be able to compete on price.
If Bitcoin became extremely liquid all over the world, or people could just receive BTC and not have to convert it to fiat, and just be able to pay their rent and buy their groceries with it, then it would be much more viable. That might happen eventually, so it's possible.
Also, for now, or at least for the next little while companies that provide Bitcoin remittance services are flying under the radar and avoiding regulation which helps them keep costs down. But over time if their companies continue growing and they get the attention of local governments, I don't see any reason why they wouldn't also try to regulate these Bitcoin remittance companies. 
I think it's possible that companies can probably make some money now focusing on a specific remittance market like they do now with like Hong Kong -&gt; Philippines, but in the long term I don't think they'll be able to compete since that market is just getting more competitive.

You sure about that? North America internet in general is known as being pretty shitty in terms of upload and download bandwidth. Google Fiber is very slowly trying to change that though. And Americans often have great ping since they are geographically close to major datacenters and such. But consumer and even commercial internet in many cases is far below many countries in Asia for example. China gets held back because of the Great Firewall from what I understand. But other major centers are tend to be ahead of the curve.
It doesn't really matter. But some of the blocksize debate has focused on North Americans hobbyists not being able to run nodes like they can now because of the lack of proper service due to what I understand to be psudo-monopolies all over the US. Canada is also known to have similar if not worse issues with a cartel of two or three companies and government regulatory barriers.

All this 'blockchain tech' is not nearly as innovative as Bitcoin was at all from my point of view. And if you view going back to trusted institutions as square one, then yes that's pretty much exactly what most of this 'blockchain tech' will end up as. The main issue is that banks and other financial services companies trust each other already(for now anyway) so in their minds including trusted parties makes sense to them. I think for them they see that there is potential to build something that's better than whatever they're currently using to come to consensus on who owes who what amount of fiat. 
Also, I mention on here often that from what I understand the banking industry in some places still heavily relies on COBOL mainframe type systems. So while this seems boring to us compared to Bitcoin's innovation, it might seem interesting to bankers stuck in the last century. 
As far as immutability goes, it's debatable depending on how you want to define it, but if n of m banks agreed to roll back to an earlier block and build off that one they could do it if enough block signers agreed. Theoretically the same thing could happen in Bitcoin though, and it did once in 2010. But realistically I think there's close to zero chance that there will ever be consensus in Bitcoin for any sort of roll back.

The transactions would essentially only be data storage with no value transferred on chain. In the multiple banks example it would just be a distributed ledger that they could use to make off chain fiat settlements more transparent and possibly improve auditability.

I'm with you 100% on this one based on my thoughts of what a realistic IoT will look like.
I'm thinking it will end up more like your credit card funding your Amazon account, who in turn will provide a lot of the infrastructure for the IoT adding modules or software on things like your fridge and washing machine. Automatic deliveries based on your own preferences.
Plus the security of a credit card means you never have any funds at risk since you're not liable for fraud. Rather not have BTC on a bunch of different devices with varying levels of security. You could say that all the technical infrastructure will be secure and provided by someone like Amazon, and I'd say sure, use your BTC with them if you want(assuming they eventually accept it, which they probably will *eventually*). But an Amazon credit card where I can't lose money and get 5% cash back might be pretty hard to beat unless you're just using BTC for the novelty of it or something.

I too think Bitcoin is going to survive too no matter what the specifications of the hard fork will be, or if there's even one at all. But, if NASDAQ is going to need to need a large number of on chain transactions then there are some outcomes here that will severely impede that. 
For all I know they don't need a large amount of transactions at all to do what they are planning and it's irrelevant what happens. But if blocks stay smaller and a fee market develops that could make the project economically unfeasible if they do in fact rely on frequent write access to the blockchain. Not just theirs, but all the projects that are expecting to use Bitcoin's blockchain as a decentralised database. Although I'm sure some might see that as a good thing as it would result in less blockchain bloat.

Sure, that's inevitably going to happen for some. But like Bitcoin it's nice to have the option to control your own money. Even if it means that sometimes you're responsible for losing it.
I've yet to lose any significant amount of Bitcoin, so I might have a biased view. And it's been painful to watch many smart people lose a lot of money over the years as well. But I still think that having the choice to do what you want with your own money is worth it.

Maybe distributed data and consensus seems insubstantial to us since we've been living it for years with Bitcoin. There seems to be a lot of interest in the idea though, maybe they've been stagnant. 
I would think that someone who could code up a decent prototype that achieves a similar thing could probably go get funded if they can find the right partners to handle the other aspects of the business. Look at what kind of stuff gets funded in Bitcoin. And this area is apparently either already bigger or on pace to eclipse Bitcoin VC funding wise. Or maybe just approach one of the existing companies and sell them your product. I'm not going to say I know for sure, but I'm not so sure you need to be a finance celebrity to compete in fintech.

Why is that necessarily true? What stops a successful sidechain from exceeding Bitcoin in security? I could see the argument that if a sidechain reached that point it would no longer have incentive to stay linked to Bitcoin as a sidehcain through the 2 way peg, and it would most likely fork off and that the 2 way peg would now effectively become a 1 way burn of BTC.
There could lots of innovative ways to secure sidechains in the future. Maybe I'm missing something but I don't see what stops them from outgrowing Bitcoin in the long run. If anything, I thought sidechains would actually be more of an incubator to foster superior cryptocurrency technology. Protect it when its young and weak, but hopefully it will one day fly and leave the nest. It solves one of the biggest issues that non-sidechain altcoins face, which is the fact that the vast majority of alts have laughably weak security compared to Bitcoin. But with sidechains alts can piggyback on Bitcoin's immense security for as long as there is incentive to do so.

@_date: 2015-08-31 13:48:38
Bitcoin doesn't make sense for remittance in almost all current cases. Unless there is a company serving a specific remittance channel where both ends have access to low cost, low spread fiat to BTC and vice versa. And that's quite rare with Localbitcoins spreads around the world being often considerable. If your sending from the US it helps, since you'll have access to buy from Coinbase and Circle. But the receiver also needs a low cost and liquid way to receive their fiat. And there are not too many options to do that in a low cost manner in many of the countries that the beneficiaries of global remittance.
It's probably possible in the short term for a company to offer a service to people in a major remittance corridor(like US to Philippines, Hong Kong to Philippines) that competes with existing services on price. But even if they do a good job of marketing and lure people away from established brands, it's highly unlikely that they'll evade things such as regulation over the long run, and that will add costs making it harder to stay competitive.
And despite what most people here seem to believe, there is downward pressure on the pricing of global remittance services now due to increased competition over the last 10-15 years. Over the long run Bitcoin remittance should only really work if people are earning BTC directly and are able to send it to someone who can spend it directly without converting it to fiat at a cost. It's possible that could happen, but some sort of major paradigm shift would have to happen, and Bitcoin as we know it would have to be transformed in to something that's far safer and far easier to use than it is now. Maybe it that will happen at some point, who knows.

Has anyone floated the idea of 4mb and then just reevaluate after a year? If in one year things like sidechains and lightning are still vapour then a bigger, long term solution can be decided.
Nothing special about the number being 4mb, but it sounds like a good compromise. The biggest issue now is that there are lot of ideas out there, but no one knows for sure if they're going to materialize or not. A small bump in the blocksize could make the difference between Bitcoin handling further adoption versus falling on its face. And we should have a much better view of exactly where all this future tech will be in a years time.
If everything works out there might not even be a need for another hard fork after the year is up too.

What about the fact that so many countries already offer free(or nearly) free instant p2p interbank transfers? The trend is that Bitcoin won't be able to complete in that area in the long run as the banking system continues to modernize in more and more countries. The US is one of the only major countries that still lags behind in this area, and I think it gives a lot of people a false impression that Bitcoin is offering a superior p2p payments system for the world, when in reality it's alright, but not likely to compete with centralised finance in that regard. 
Not to mention that there is a very significant and powerful section of the user base sees Bitcoin's future as a fairly high fee settlement network.
The value in Bitcoin comes from it's decentralisation and its freedom. Consumer payments, p2p payments, remittance are all dead ends in my opinion for the most part. Competing in those niches will be extremely difficult and long run dominance is very unlikely. 
I'm constantly surprised how often I need to bring up that pretty much every country other than the US already has a fairly modern banking system where you can instantly send free interbank p2p transfers. Canada, the UK, many European countries, all over Asia ect.

Everyone agrees that there are probably alternative or better ways to implement something similar. But so far it seems all the fintech interest in blockchains comes at least partially due to the fact that it's an existing easily adaptable open source technology that actually exists today.
If you can implement something vastly superior with similar characteristics in a SQL database I suggest you drop everything you're doing now and start doing that because there's literally millions of dollars waiting to be thrown at you. And I'm not being snarky or sarcastic, I don't think you're necessary wrong at all. Just that there's a huge demand from banks and financial services companies for these things now. And don't forget that there's still banks that rely on COBOL even today. So it's not that surprising that there might be some interest.

A lot of the sales pitch of Bitcoin over the years and leading up in to today is low fees. But there seems to be a significant group of people that see the future of Bitcoin as one with necessarily much higher fees. Both in the short-medium term and the longer term when miners are expected to get the majority of their compensation from fees.
I wonder how high fees will have to be for Bitcoin to no longer be considered a low fee solution. Bank wires are around $30 normally, but a lot of countries also have free instant p2p interbank transfers. So the range there is quite high. I'm not saying it will necessarily be a bad thing if that's the way Bitcoin becomes successful, but a lot of people expected it to complete on costs for things like slightly higher than micro-transactions and such. Maybe it's not such a bad thing though, since any country with reasonably modern banking already has the instant cheap p2p thing down already. I don't know, it will be interesting to see how it goes, as Bitcoin is kind of at a crossroads now.
@_date: 2015-07-16 22:05:51
I'd still be a bit worried about the backlash from someone using 0 conf appropiately for a low value transaction feeling betrayed if they ever got double spent. Now no one who understands Bitcoin should ever feel that way if it happened to them, but I'm not sure that too many of the tens of thousands of merchants that we've been told have been introduced to Bitcoin actually understand it on any meaningful level. One of the main selling points to vendors was the whole 'no chargebacks' thing. Which is true of course with the standard disclaimer about confirmations and such, but I'm not so sure many merchants are aware of the difference. The issue that I'm afraid of is not that they'll lose a lot of money from Bitcoin fraud, that's pretty unlikely as they should become aware of it quickly if it happens, but that they'll feel like they were lied to about Bitcoin. A few angry merchants(even if it's for a few bucks and they're mad just over the principle of it) that feel that they've been ripped off could be a big set back if something like that went viral in mainstream media. It could cause a lot of misinformation to be spread about Bitcoin.
If you, or others can provide services that mitigate the whole 0 conf attack angle, then that's great and I hope it works out. I just bring this up to highlight that the financial damage from successful double spends could end up causing the whole Bitcoin economy much more damage than just the loss suffered by the victim. 0 confs even today might add enough utility to Bitcoin that any concerns I've raised are overshadowed by the benefits of 0 confs too. I don't know, it's a complicated issue with a lot of different ways to look at it I think.

No, it's irresponsible for them to let their hash get so high. BTCGuild did it right. With a single entity blatantly over 50% it really starts to defeat the purpose of a decentralised currency.
They were well run from a 'get as much hash power as possible' standpoint, but not raising fees or doing something similar as they approach 50% should theoretically do more economic damage to Bitcoin than whatever their short term gain is.
The reality is that the mining situation just isn't very good. And it's probably worse now than it was even with Ghash being irresponsible. Too much physical hash power in China is worse than a pool getting ~40% imo.

Since NASDAQ is a global operation they could use a non-token, public but permissioned blockchain, cryptographically secured and distributed around the world(edited*). I'd bet that would be a step up for them anyway if they're seriously considering using Coloured Coins.(edit: not meant to be a negative comment about CC, just that clearly they have interest in the technology in general and seem to have determined a need for it)
As much as I love Bitcoin, I don't see the logic in an organization like NASDAQ needing to do these things on the Bitcoin blockchain itself. Maybe if this scaling drama gets settled next year and solutions are found and debates are settled. I see the value in fully decentralising something like this, but it also comes at a cost of being reliant on what is naturally a decentralised system that's out of their control.
edit: I changed this: ~~with the same cryptography that Bitcoin uses~~. I just thinking along the lines of using SHA2 (or even SHA3 if that's the latest standard), not meant to imply that it would use the whole Bitcoin cryptosystem including the PoW part.

I was wondering why no one had just proposed a simple change to somewhere to between 2-5 MB so we get a bit of a cushion to see whether or not things like Lightning succeed next year.
The only downside to this is that a hard fork will have to be done. But if it's really uncontroversial then succeeding at something that might be considered a test run hard fork in case more drastic changes need to me made down the line would be a big positive and lessen the uncertainty around hard forks.

Yes, not only that but almost everywhere else in the West and Asia(and probably many more regions) also has a banking system that isn't 15 years behind like the one in the US is. Free instant p2p interbank domestic transfers are ubiquitous all over the world. Some times individual banks will add small fees, but free is quite common in multiple countries in my experience.
@_date: 2015-07-20 17:35:31




For now that's the only answer though. It sucks, and we don't have to like it, but it's the reality. There are some services now that you can outsource to and they'll use their network monitoring algos to watch for double spends. And some of them will guarantee them, sort of like insurance I think.
I've been suggesting the devs take a serious look at lowering the block interval as well when they do the block size hard fork. Even 5 minutes would be a great quality of life improvement. And if there are technical reasons why 5 minutes is a poor choice, then explore &gt;5 but &lt;10. Might as well take advantage of the hard fork and make some improvements as long as the trade offs are worth it.

What they should do then is have very specific instructions for each country on how to buy and use Bitcoin.
Actually what would be good for this type of situation is a reverse Bitpay thing where people could use their credit card with a third party who instantly converts fiat to BTC and sends BTC to Backpage. I know with credit card fraud that's not very feasible, but it would be nice.

Because it only costs a bit less than a million a day to sustain around this range. $50k would be closer to 200 million a day. That's a lot of demand that needs to be met. Yes, the inflation decreases over time but for as long as there is inflation Bitcoin is self-limiting in this way.

Fed is actually fairly transparent:

If the government wanted to abolish the Fed and create a new central bank they could do that. It's not like the Fed is omnipotent or anything.

It's not quite *that* bad. Satoshi appears to have mined around a million BTC. There's ~14 million BTC now and 21 million ever to be mined. So that's quite a bit less than half.
But Satoshi likely having access to that amount of bitcoin does make it difficult to explain to outsiders. Even if we believe that Satoshi would never do some sort of mass sell off, I've found it a bit difficult to make the case that the anonymous creator would never do something like that.
It's just something else that adds to the risk profile of Bitcoin. But I'm not too concerned about it personally. It would be nice though if he destroyed most of those BTC in a cryptographically verifiable way though.

EVE Online is an example of a game who have successfully integrated virtual currency with real world value. They even hire economists to help keep everything in check.
Some of the stories of virtual robberies and such in EVE that I've read make Bitcoin scams look amateur. Not that the monetary amounts are similar of course, I think most stories I've read about EVE involve five figure amounts as opposed to the millions commonly involved in Bitcoin. But it terms of pure duplicitousness and deception some of those EVE scams are truly epic.

Massive respect to David Harding for attempting to do the right thing and starting an honest discussion.

That seems to be totally intentional from the attacker too. 
I still don't get what the attack was trying to prove. I didn't get anything out of it related to the block size debate personally. Bigger blocks would have cleared out the mem pool much quicker. But Bitcoin also functioned pretty well under the attack. Showing that even if Bitcoin can't scale, it's not just going to break. The fee market will move things along if necessary. So to me the whole thing was kind of a wash.
I wish the attacker(s) would have written something like a post-mortem on what the hell the point of that was supposed to be.

It doesn't necessarily have to be a blockchain. But they specifically mentioned that they were using and testing *that* technology.

Personally I think gold is most analogous. Not saying that Bitcoin is going to be overtaking gold anytime soon(or ever perhaps), but as an asset I really think they can fill a similar niche.

The thing is ~595 of those don't have a chance in hell of getting upvoted as for the most part they are irrelevant to Bitcoin at this point. But there are some technologies that are important enough to be discussed in the context of how they may effect Bitcoin, or how Bitcoin might interact with such a technology. Especially considering sidechains are supposed to become a reality in the near future. If the community wants to discuss something they'll upvote it. An all or nothing policy might make more sense on the Bitcoin Discussion sub board at Bitcointalk since that format could easily be overrun with altcoin posts, but Reddit is supposed to self-select posts and for the most part it does a good job.
I think a more lenient policy like limiting discussion to one thread per week or something would make more sense than an all out ban.

Yes, I could imagine a similar product that someone could develop in an SQL environment with cryptographically secured entries, redundancy, and some form of making the entries immutable. Also, something like Git seems to check some of the boxes too.
I really think in this case the token of value part of it is irrelevant for what people have in mind. I understand what you're saying, but  I don't think the people who are interested in this tech have any need for decentralisation or trustlessness. Whether they realize the value in those things or not is another topic though. All that this type of technology would provide is a distributed way to store data in a cryptographically verifiable way.
So the question is what's the big deal about a distributed database with cryptographically verifiable entries? Not much really, but I suspect that there are a lot of financial services companies out there that might see it as a step forward from what they're working with now. Remember, COBOL is still widely used in the banking industry.

They have little to nothing to do with Bitcoin or currency as I said in my post. Banks deal in fiat anyway, I don't see the need for their ledger to have a native currency or token. Maybe in the future they'll want to get fancy and issue their own digital currencies though, you never know.

The only one you could be referring to out of the people that I've mentioned are people from Bitshares, as they're the ones who have actually created a system themselves. And I don't follow Bitshares at all so I can't really comment on specifics. But I don't think I've come across a criticism that disqualifies their DPoS system (which apparently doesn't suffer from NaS issues). Most arguments I've seen are more about that a proper PoS system would be superior/more decentralised. I'm not making any claims about their DPoS system here, but Vitalik seems to have formed a positive opinion on it. But in my head I'm mostly still filing it under the 'too good to be true' category for now.


1) The evidence that PoS doesn't work is very strong
2) Every proposal for a PoS system has some form of centralization or is broken in some way.
Even if this is true, the pay off is so high for cryptocurrency in general if a robust PoS system is proven and/or discovered, that in my opinion it should be one of the top priorities of researchers in the field. The widespread negative attitudes from Bitcoin maximalists don't help anything either.

Not changing the block size and changing it are both 'artificial manipulation' and psuedocentralised control either way you play it. The white paper wasn't some sort of economic policy document. The reality is that Bitcoin does have centralised hybrid economic-technical policy decisions that need to be made and one of those is setting the block size cap.
Part of the difference here though is that if enough people *really* wanted a different policy change could happen. But it would probably be pretty damaging. But it would also be a victory for decentralisation. If something like this happened for the wrong reasons though it could really fracture the community.

Why not both forms? Government controlled digital money in inevitable imo. But it doesn't necessarily exclude alternative forms existing.

@_date: 2015-07-14 21:34:59
This whole blockchain without Bitcoin topic has been bugging me for a while, so consider this example and tell me why this would be a stupid idea:
Say there are ten big banks in a country, and they decide they want an auditable public ledger. So 'blockchain technology' is in, and they decide to use a blockchain to do this. The way they set it up is each block is cryptographically signed by each bank to verify that they agree on the contents of the block. So they do this, and I think we can probably agree that there may be some value in having publicly auditable ledgers made available by banks, but my questions are:
Is using the blockchain as a data structure to record this worthwhile? Or is it the wrong choice? It's effectively just a way to share data with people that is shown to be cryptographically verified by the participants that's time stamped and ordered, this could probably be done in a number of ways, but does software exist already that could easily fill this role and do it better?(Git?)
I mean, they could have a database and just cryptographically sign every entry, but that doesn't provide the same immutability that a blockchain is supposed to provide. I don't really know what the alternatives are that exist, so I'm curious how much actual value using a blockchain can provide.
All this 'Fintech' stuff keeps coming up, and I have a feeling there might actually be some potential value there for banks and such, not necessarily using a blockchain, but again I don't know what viable alternatives exist yet. People here really love to just completely dismiss the whole idea all together if it doesn't use Bitcoin though, and I don't know why. The issue seems to be about data and verification, and not cryptocurrency.
Obviously, Bitcoin can be used to add the trustless variable. But I don't think there's too much interest in that yet from banks. I suspect they're more interested in the distributed consensus thing. They already operate in an environment where they send billions between each other daily. Interbank trust is not something I can imagine they consider an issue. (Some might say: *yet*, but that's not particularly relevant to them since they won't agree)
@_date: 2015-08-01 11:35:25


Was it that or was it just not wanting to make the additional changes that would be required to remove that existing limitation from the initial release by Satoshi?
@_date: 2015-07-01 12:10:05
True. That's another one of these points that I don't think have been brought up enough recently.
For as solid as Bitcoin is right now, there sure is a lot of 'Step 3: ???, Step 4: Profit' when it comes to whats actually going to happen when the block reward subsidy stops providing sufficient incentive. The fact that Bitcoin is designed to *rely* on fees at that point is pretty scary tbh.
@_date: 2015-07-16 12:24:47

@_date: 2015-07-01 15:16:58
Ok, but you realize that there's probably a reasonable argument that some semi-centralised Bitcoin-like system could meet the "biggest and most beneficial social impact" criteria. Some people would rather have nothing than something that's not sufficiently decentralised. That's just their particular worldview, and they are unlikely to change that because they prioritize different values.
@_date: 2015-07-03 15:27:59
Yeah, it's interesting to see.
@_date: 2015-07-25 21:32:23
Trustlessness isn't one of the desired characteristics. From what I understand what is attracting people are the distributed consensus aspects, immutability, and perceived improved accountability and audit availability, redundancy. We might consider them centralised relative to Bitcoin, but these are often global organizations and in many cases multiple organizations that apparently want a shared permissioned ledger that they feel will add value over whatever they have now.
Also, 'blockchain' is kind of just a catch all word for this fintech stuff. In the near future the preferred solution might very well be based on SQL or something else. For now it's the blockchain that's giving people these ideas. Some companies don't even call their solutions blockchains now since I assume they've developed systems that avoid the need for that particular data structure. It is super easy right now for an organization just to fork one of the open source crypto projects now and test it out, so I'm not surprised that they're doing it.
@_date: 2015-07-01 16:21:52
You don't think having a fiat substitute in cryptocurrency form that can be used in decentralised exchanges and potentially smart contracts has utility? Especially one backed by Citibank?

Has anyone theorized a cut off point for a block size where a miner trying to gain an edge this way would be indifferent to actually validating versus doing what they were just found out to be doing? 
Or is there always an edge by doing this pretty much?
edit: If I'm being downvoted I guess I should elaborate a bit: I mean just in theory, like if it's 10kb or something that's fine. I'm just curious if it's going to be done regardless of the block size, or if there's some special number or range where the diminishing returns kick in. I know there's cost in the form of them accidentally building on invalid blocks or something like that. But obviously they decided they gained a higher profit expectation overall from doing what they did.
@_date: 2015-07-13 21:59:17

@_date: 2015-07-29 21:28:08
People always tend to leave out the fact that the lead developer of Bitcoin who has no association whatsoever with Blockstream to my knowledge also has a conservative stance on the block size issue. Why does that always conveniently get left out in these Blockstream conspiracy posts? Only 2 of the 5 people with commit access work for Blockstream anyway. Even if they did in fact have some agenda, they could only pursue it with at least one other developer agreeing, and in reality I don't think 3/5 has ever been some automatic green light to commit whatever.
I don't have the answers on the block size debate, but you would think that the lead developers opinion would be mentioned more in discussions on here when in reality I can't remember the last time I've seen it mentioned. 
@_date: 2015-07-01 19:04:55
Sounds like they're just playing around with Bitcoin forks learning how they work and such. Since they have three separate ones I'd guess they have a PoW Bitcoin style chain, a 2.0 PoS chain like NXT or something like Bitshares, and maybe an Ethereum fork.

I don't think anywhere else uses checks at all, so no holding unless you have a money order from Nigeria or something. Lots of countries banking is fully electronic and you can send anyone money instantly through a website or phone app. Which they can withdraw right away or send to someone else. I think *most*(can't say this for sure, but there are so many) countries in the Western world and Asia have banking systems that work this way for p2p transfers. I have no idea why the US never bothered to implement something like this. But it's probably been like 10 years now for a lot of the countries that have interbank transfers working like this.

In a n of m signing situation compromising a single user shouldn't put the whole system at risk. Keeping private keys offline and signing things on a cold machine should virtually eliminate any sort of hacking situation. It's one thing to have different elements of a massive world wide network of computers and ATMs and such and get hacked, it's another thing not to be able to follow the same basic security that we all follow when we want to protect our own private keys.
Also, in a 'worst possible scenario' case where some malicious entity decides to write a bunch of damaging data to the permissioned blockchain, if it really needed to happen the banks could just decide to roll back to the last clean block after fixing the security issue. Bitcoin was rolled back in 2010, but that's not realistically going to be able to happen ever again.

Outside the US there are many countries that have free instant interbank domestic transfers. Sometimes there are small fees in some countries.

Just domestic, but interbank. Often free, but banks set their own policies for the most part so it can vary, but when I've seen a fee it's been minimal, like 50 cents equivalent or something dependent on the country. UK is all free interbank domestic as far as I know. Also, the 4-5 clearance thing seems to be a US thing as well, as I've received and immediately withdrawn cash countless times in different countries. Works really well for Bitcoin trading. So easy to buy and sell Bitcoin with Localbitcoins if you're outside the US and in one of the many countries where you can just transfer money via the website or a phone app. Can be good for remittance if the spreads are decent enough. And you can even have someone on Localbitcoins just instantly send the money to someone else's account as you sell them BTC as long as you give them the name and account number or whatever is required. 
You can see how fragmented the US transfer system is on Localbitcoins if you look at the amount of payment methods on the drop down option menu for US trades. It looks like ~25 proprietary services from all sorts of different companies. Seems needlessly over complicated.

People like to take any excuse to dump in order to buy back cheaper. Much easier to scare people into selling than it is to excite people into buying. I'm sure that can be proved quantitatively by comparing the speed of sell offs relative to rises. That also gets exasperated by the popularity of people trading on margin with positions that are easily liquidated.
Also, as we know the Greek people haven't been buying BTC. But this run up was sparked by speculators betting that the turmoil would raise demand from other speculators, which it did. Then China came in with it's own issues on top of that and the subsequent speculation that follows that.

Monetary policy with fiat tends to target a small inflation rate and will create money to hit that target, and the central banks will separately set an interest rate. I don't see how the fiat portion of that equation is based on interest. Interest does have an important part in that style of economy but I don't see why fiat couldn't be used in a interest rate free economy too. It might be a little more complex for the central bank to lend money to the banks though and manage the economy.

Personally, and I don't think I'm alone on this, I can't see Bitcoin alone being able to compete in the consumer payments niche. Maybe something in the future built off of Lightning or Sidechains run by a company that can offer incentives competitive with credit cards. But not at this point.
Bitcoin's main value comes from its decenralisation and existence outside of the traditional financial system. On its own it will have a hard time competing against specialized centralised financial services.

That's fine, but I get the impression that many people won't be particularly interested in this new age of Bitcoin. 
There will still be demand for low cost value transfer, so either some off chain Bitcoin based system will meet that demand or something else will. If people don't care about decentralisation there's already things like Coinbase.
Not saying that this is a good thing or a bad thing. Just that there are a lot of people who won't be pleased if this becomes the new normal.

Hmm, I'm not on either side but I think it's been pretty clear that so far that's been the reality. And that the only thing stopping it is a hardcore group of technical people and idealists.
I'm a bit surprised that you've gotten a different impression. There are a shitload of people, certainly more in raw numbers and most likely more in economic terms who side with Gavin and Mike. That doesn't necessarily make them right, and it's actually a bit scary when thinking of what could happen in the future with something other than this blocksize thing being pushed through with an ignorant majority somehow. But yeah this whole situation is going to be interesting to see how it unfolds because it will probably set the tone for the future politics of Bitcoin.

Yeah, it should be fairly trivial to fork pretty much any of the existing cryptocurrency projects and customize them to have blocks signed by n of m rather than PoW or whatever else.

Bitcoin is a whole new animal here and I think people downplay the threat of holding significant amounts personally. Only takes one person off offhandedly mentioning to someone that you're the rich Bitcoin guy for that information to potentially spread to the wrong people.

Well, the debate between people has been going on forever. Try going on Bitcointalk or here and asking something like: "Is Bitcoin instant transactions?". And then watch people debate it. Maybe less so in the last few months with people becoming more conservative over time as Peter Todd and others have been campaigning over the years for people not to be so complacent and comfortable with such an obviously insecure way of transacting(assuming no additional mitigation).
Without pulling out a bunch of old posts from people, I think some might agree with me that like the blocksize debate, the whole 0 conf thing is something that's been an issue for years now.


I agree with this 100%. My major concern is that many people accepting 0 conf aren't fully aware that its even a possibility. I fear that the 'trustless' and 'no chargebacks' branding may of lulled some people in to a false sense of security. 
@_date: 2015-07-19 16:48:38
Not everyone in this sub lives and dies by the pump train. It's pretty brutal at times, but I'll tell you that there are a good amount of people in this community who would agree with what you're saying and welcome any criticism. If no one speaks up then it's harder to highlight what problems need addressing first and what should be lower priority. Bitcoin has been moving way too fast for what it's ready to support, and it's not good PR to have it sold as the solution to everything. Especially when it's not yet close to being in a user friendly form that's going to make the average person comfortable using Bitcoin, or holding it for other purposes. 
@_date: 2015-07-19 17:25:11
How are the blockchain data structure and Bitcoin joined at the hip? They're not at all based on my research. People keep repeating this, that blockchain and Bitcoin are inseparable, but I don't see why that's necessarily true at all. I'll link a couple of my posts from a recent thread here: 
tl;dr to me is that using a blockchain or some similar data structure for banks or other financial services could probably provide them with some value.
Comparing the 'blockchain technology' that a lot of these organizations are interested in and Bitcoin is a red herring. Trustlessness is unlikely a feature that concerns them very much. But a distributed, cryptographically secure, publicly auditable(or private if they wanted that) immutable ledger, with no token of value since blocks can just be signed by participants, is likely a huge step up for an industry that still heavily relies on COBOL. 
Does anything currently exist that provides that set of features in one package? It doesn't necessarily have to be a blockchain at all. People here say all they need is a database, but no one has been able to point to an existing data product that checks all the boxes that using a blockchain would provide. So for now I guess it's easy for them just to use the 'blockchain technology' buzzword, because it probably best describes what some people are looking for. It's just not Bitcoin. The two ideas are fundamentally different in that Bitcoin is truly decentralised, while it's likely that most organizations are going to want something semi-decentralised or distributed. Which we in the Bitcoin community would probably just label 'centralised', considering we don't really use language that captures the shades of decentralisation.
@_date: 2015-07-24 12:28:20
Yeah. People underestimate how amazing it is that we have enough demand to more or less offset the monetary base inflation from the mining subsidy.

We've only been waiting for like 5 years now for a decentralised crypto exchange. No biggie.

Especially since this block debate has devolved in to a group of people who have no idea what the implications of what they're asking for just shouting and making up conspiracy theories about developers.

Putting aside environmental concerns, they're not inherently bad if there are lots and lots of them. The concern comes from only having a small amount of mega farms in one area rather than having them distributed all over the world. So basically it's just a centralisation concern. 
Same concern with nodes, but to a lesser extent. People worry about pushing out the hobbyist average person running their own node by having bandwidth requirements too high(and to a much lesser extent memory issues).
Some people are fine with having Bitcoin run by a few mega data centers and consider that sufficiently decentralised. Others strongly disagree with that view and want to do everything they can to prevent that from occurring.

I don't really think the Bitcoin community is particularly big in general. I think the simplistic 'bitcoin won't scale if we don't increase the blocksize right away' rhetoric resonates with most people. It's a fear based argument, and there is a grain of truth to it at least. If there was another bubble that started tomorrow and a mass influx of new users, there's a decent chance that Bitcoin shits the bed and leaves a bad impression on people. The media would love to run some stories about how Bitcoin cracked under the pressure I'm sure. I think it's not very difficult for them to convince the average Bitcoiner that their investment is at stake unless they jump on the Mike/Gavin bandwagon. And so far I think they have convinced a lot of people. That's my impression so far anyway, I don't have any evidence, and you could be right that there's some silent majority of reasonable users out there considering the issue on a deeper level, but I'd be surprised.

No one has been able to name anything specific yet though(not saying it doesn't exist). Some kind of SQL based database and Git are often mentioned, but those don't work out of the box like forking an existing blockchain based project does now.

Yes. Just take a look at how much volume goes on through Localbitcoins through instant bank transfers. Check Canada, the UK, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Philippines, China. Anywhere really. Just look at the drop down menu for national bank transfer. It's not always called 'national bank transfer' but there's normally a similar network. Canada is interac I think.
You can't claw back these transfers in almost all cases it seems, even if you're scammed. They warn you online and at ATMs not to send money to scammers because you're not going to be getting back in almost all cases unless you actually catch someone and extract money somehow through court. There's no simple chargeback like on a credit card, it's not 100% trustless like BTC but it's pretty tight. Else people wouldn't be selling BTC with such a low spread using national bank transfers. You can compare it to Paypal sales on Localbitcoins, which as everyone knows can be clawed back. The spread for Paypal tx is massive to make up for fraud. Not so with national bank transfers.
It's actually really weird how when you enter United States as the country 'national bank transfer' disappears from the list and gets replaced by what looks like about 25 random proprietary money transfer services. It's just so much more efficient to have instant p2p interbank transfers that it makes absolutely no sense to me why US banks haven't created such a network sometime in the last 15 years. Someone must be gaining something from holding it back, but I don't know what. 
@_date: 2015-07-14 17:09:11
Transaction fees are supposed to provide the incentive for miners. It will have to be a hell of a lot of transaction fees though to keep the network at any reasonable level of security. Especially considering people are pretty used to the super secure network as it is currently, funded by the hundreds of millions of dollars of monetary base inflation we have now.
If BTC stays at a high price though this won't be an issue for a long time, so not much to worry about yet.

With all the super cheap electricity, chip fabrication, and cheap  warehouse space in China, I'm not so sure that much of that hash is done outside of the handful of mega farms.
It's possible. But the farms just keep expanding from what I've seen in the reports and pictures on here.

How so? There are already existing cryptocurrencies with blockchains that use similar methods. Bitshares and their DPoS system is one example of one that's open.

Capital controls on outgoing wires and such notwithstanding.

This plus the fact that the monetary base inflation of Bitcoin is still pretty high and scales with the price, really illustrates just how unlikely we are to see some of the prices that so many people have predicted in this community. I.e five figure BTC and higher. There was an article that listed the 2014 predictions from a lot of people in the industry and it was a bit ridiculous looking back on what a lot of these people were predicting.
5-10++ years from now if Bitcoin is still the primary cryptocurrency or asset in its category then it's a bit different though. The inflation needs to go way down though first. Although then the incentive to mine will have to come from fees or some other arrangement if the network is to stay at similar levels of security. Running the numbers on fees though seems like it's probably the most shaky part of Bitcoin's economic formula. The inflation is killer for the price, but of course it's what results in the extremely secure network that is the cornerstone of Bitcoin.

The real question is whether or not 0 conf *should* be dead.
There's definitely a lot of potential for massive PR damage to Bitcoin if people decide to start exploiting every chance they get to double spend 0 conf and the media picks up and runs with it.
Worst case scenario is you get a bunch of 14 year hold wannabe 'hackers' running around to actual real life locations accepting Bitcoin with something like Bitpay that doesn't guarentee against double spends. Some script kiddie phone app that makes it easier for people to attempt real life double spends could just kill Bitcoin in the eyes of many people. Regardless of the fact that 0 confs were never meant to be secure. A lot of people just won't care and Bitcoin will have a hard time wiping that label off itself.
It's not really a big deal, but it could be made out to be such a bigger deal than it actually is because people are dead set on making 0 conf transactions standard for almost all uses. Like I said at the start of the post, the big question is whether or not they should be. They offer value, but there could be a much darker side than people seem to expect. Not an easy decision to weigh the trade offs.

How much more than 25k BTC could he have actually had? If he did/does have much more than he's probably one of the top whales in crypto.


And he didn't even hesitate to send goat a one million Baht bank wire first without escrow to make that trade. That was interesting. Not that I wouldn't trust goat in general for trading, but that takes some balls. :P

Yes, I think about this issue a lot too. A lot of the power of Bitcoin is allowing people to create decentralised applications that cut out the middle man altogether and put the money directly in the hands of the counterparty. Things like Streamium and other projects that are working to get people using payment channels are a good example.
I honestly think that a lot of VCs would do better by just *directly* investing in Bitcoin by actually buying a significant amount, and using their funds to help support promising open source projects in the community. A lot of the most revolutionary projects are not designed to enrich a small group of investors. They're designed to enrich everyone that uses them. It's a completely new paradigm and I don't think too many in SV get it yet. 
Although I think some might be beginning to realize it, as we recently saw Open Bazaar get funded, and that was great to see. But really, that pales in comparison to the total amount that's being thrown at Bitcoin companies. A lot of pretty weak businesses seem to get funded where just buying bitcoin would probably have a higher expected value for them.

I haven't read the whole thread yet, so I'm not sure if you answered this elsewhere, but is Doge also not vulnerable to this attack like LTC?
Also, I think having an official paper wallet generator included that's known to work well and be trusted sounds like a pretty good idea. Rather than having people use websites that may or may not be safe to do it.

Maybe yeah. But another possibility is that if they suspect false or misleading info they might freeze their account and funds in it. I've seen this happen in other industries that deal with a lot of fraud. Not saying that Bitstamp would do this, but just that it's something to consider.

This section is pretty interesting. I hadn't thought of that before. I could see direct competitors bidding to keep each others transactions out of blocks. Right now it would be pretty cheap just to offer 100% more than what the tx fees would be to miners or something similar. Whether or not the miners would agree is another thing I guess, since this opens a whole other can of worms.

@_date: 2015-08-23 14:18:31
I don't know, but it's sufficiently different from what we've always called an altcoin to warrant a different descriptor.
It's a bit tricky here because if it were 95% percent of the hash accepting the hard fork then I don't think there would be enough hash power on the old chain to move blocks in a timely manner. So it would have very little chance of surviving. But with 75% there's some chance that the left over 25% decides to keep pointing at the old chain and could probably eventually get the difficulty dropped back to where they're mining blocks around the 10 min target. It's a significant financial gamble for those remaining miners to not just join the crowd and keep mining on the old chain though. It would be a very unique situation, maybe just call each chain by it's version number or something. 0.11.0A vs 0.11.0(not a very good solution though).
@_date: 2015-07-17 15:19:02
I think that will be debated again next year if this change goes through. The way I see it is this hard fork will buy us some time, hopefully a full year, at which point we can reevaluate all of the solutions that have been proposed but are not developed yet such as Lightning. If things aren't looking good a year from now I'd imagine there will be more people taking a serious look at long term blocksize scaling solutions.

What's the prize for a hacker that hacks a blockchain without a token of value? They could certainly cost the companies involved a lot of money, but not sure what their reward is.
Plus they would be stupid not to keep their private key that they use to sign things offline anyway. If anything, this security paradigm might be the first one where as long as they follow the basic procedure of doing the signing on a secure offline machine there's virtually no chance it can be hacked sort of physical access or the cryptography being broken(probably SHA256 like Bitcoin I'd guess, so not likely).

I wouldn't say that. I don't know if they're still pursuing that angle or not, but if they are there's still a chance they could pull it off. I wouldn't write the possibility off at all. In terms of raw numbers I think they have attracted a lot support as they have a pretty clear political message that resonates with people. For people more interested in the technical debate behind it, it's a bit more complicated. But if there were a liquid prediction market I think you might be surprised with what the market would set as the probability of something like that happening.
Don't underestimate how much a support they could draw from Silicon Valley if they're selling them a future where Bitcoin reaches a high level of global adoption at scale.
Even if the probability of something like that happening was say 20%, that would be pretty incredible considering how unprecedented it would be.

For any real money I think it would be good to educate them enough so that they can have the option to choose to convert back if they want.

It might do that yeah. But if there is a legit alternative where fees are an order of magnitude cheaper you would almost have to expect a certain amount of commerce to switch over.

Is there something to warn the user if there looks to be a reasonable chance that their transaction won't be included in the next 48 hours and therefore dropped from the mem pool? I mean this is extremely unlikely to happen now for a tx with any sort of reasonable fee. But with 300k blocks and the continued growth of Bitcoin it sounds plausible. That would be a really bad user experience though.

I think a lot of Chinese are more shrewd and less naive than some people might assume. When it comes to saving money they tend to be pretty careful. That's part of the reason those 'ghost cities' exist in China and there are so many empty apartment buildings. Real estate is one of the few ways that they can invest in something tangible. Gold is popular too all over Asia unsurprisingly. So Bitcoin as an asset that they can control is not too much of a leap for many people once they can understand what it actually is(which is admittedly not easy). 
@_date: 2015-07-15 08:20:23
Not sure it's that simple. If there's an important cancer drug that costs 1 billion dollars to R&amp;D, and lets for the sake of argument say that we live in a society with very little regulation and it costs say 10% of that instead, and say the global market for the drug is 2 billion. If there are 100 other pharmaceutical companies in the world that are capable of reproducing and distributing the drug once its known, there's going to be very little chance that producing this life saving drug is going to be profitable at all. In a situation like this with no barriers, maximizing profits can easily lead to less development of expensive but beneficial drugs.
I'm not saying that the way things now are good at all, but balancing the incentives to maximize benefit I don't think is easy or as simple as having zero regulation. Maybe in some aspects, but probably not all. I think the optimal solution would be some sort of balance that also incentivizes innovation while also trying to drive down R&amp;D cost.
Someone might argue that over the long run with an entirely free market eventually there would be a complete paradigm change with drug development through technological improvement, drastically cutting costs and making it more efficient. That might be true, but it's also pretty speculative. I would say that in that case there would probably be more incentive to drive R&amp;D costs as low as possible when you don't get the benefit of some sort of regulated grace period to recoup your costs.

This whole Backpage thing has come up because it's necessary for them to post their ads, but after that there's no particular reason for them to choose to take bitcoin over cash for their actual services.

Because one of the more reasonable views in my opinion is that if things go well for Bitcoin it has a chance of gaining some ground in the world market as an asset similar to gold.

Ok, but say in a hard fork situation a miner hasn't upgraded their software and they see that someone mined this new block that appears invalid to them(say a 4mb block). Wouldn't they ignore that and instead continue to mine off what they would see as the last valid block according to their now out of date software? Creating a fork with anyone who hasn't upgraded to accept the new hard fork rules mine on what would look like an 'old' chain with the current 1mb rules?
People who have upgraded their software to accept the new 4mb valid blocks would still accept old style 1mb blocks as you say, but I thought the issue might be that in this hard fork situation multiple miners who haven't prepared themselves for the new rules go off on their own fork and continue to build off what they see as valid blocks(1mb ones). Because people mining 4mb blocks will build off each other while the 1mb people will only build off other 1mb blocks. Maybe I'm missing something though, I don't really know tbh.
@_date: 2015-07-21 13:08:16
People like to use the whole 'kicking the can' rhetoric, but one of the biggest issues that has come up during the debate is the fact that there are multiple proposed solutions that are in development, but we don't know which ones, if any, will solve the perceived problems.
Right now everything is completely speculative, and what a minor blocksize increase like this will do is buy time for the community to observe the results of projects like Lightning and Sidechains. A year from now people will be able to debate from much more solid positions, with new data on how things have unfolded.
One of the potential results of this is that other scaling solutions meet our needs and no further block size increase is needed. So it's not necessarily just kicking the can as you say.

Well it's not inherent to only blockchains, but keeping your keys used to either sign blocks or actual private keys for some token offline on a system that you use only to sign transactions is pretty good security. Especially if access to that cold machine is very physically secure as well. Using blockchain tech if done properly should result in excellent security simply by limiting the potential attack vectors as well as using strong cryptography.
@_date: 2015-07-21 10:18:42
Lots of interbank instant domestic transfers are *effectively* non-reversible. Not like Bitcoin is trustless and non-reversible, but they're not like credit cards that can easily be charged back. And if you get scammed the chances of recovering your money are close to zero and they specifically warn you when you send money not to send to people you don't know because if it's a scam you're out of luck.
For an example of this in action compare the spreads on different countries 'national bank transfers' on Localbitcoins to trades with Paypal(which of course we all know is reversible). You'll notice that the national bank transfers option tends to have the lowest spreads, implying the least risk. While Paypal has extremely high spreads so traders can attempt to offset the fraud they'll inevitably run in to. 
I'll note that Americans don't have any sort of national bank transfer system now, as it comes up often in these discussions.
And while different countries will have different policies, in my experience national bank transfers have been the most secure way for people to trade Bitcoin. I'm sure they're not perfect, it's a big world and knowing banks I'm sure there are some horror stories out there. But the success of national bank transfers on Localbitcoins lends pretty good evidence that they tend to be a good way to trade BTC.

The reality is that if someone was really wanting to take down Bitcoin, or at least drive it as underground as possible, and they were willing to spend hundreds of millions if not a billion+ to fully execute an attack plan, they could. The point of Bitcoin is that it actually takes someone spending that amount of money to do so. Bitcoin probably won't ever be invulnerable. Especially when you see China causally dumping $800 billion in to its stock market like it did this week. But as time goes on and the network gets more secure, the list of entities that could realistically expend the resources if they wanted to grows smaller. Add that and the fact that Bitcoin is pretty neutral and doesn't really have some inherent reason to attack it and it results in a pretty secure system from at least all the known attack vectors.

Security wise a permissioned ledger between banks should be more secure since in both cases of using a fully decentralised ledger and a permissioned one you would need to protect your keys either way. But with the fully decentralised ledger there are additional attack vectors that you have to worry about that have already been well documented over the years from our experience with Bitcoin.
As an aside if anyone in the world should be able to protect a set of private keys you would think it would be banks. I'd be curious to hear what kind of security system or best practices they come up with for this type of thing as it might improve our own Bitcoin security if our companies decide to mimic their methods. That is of course if we determine them effective, but with the amount of money these banks likely spend on security and such I'd expect some solid practices.

They might not end up using a blockchain style data structure in the end. But for now 'blockchain tech' is the current buzzword and last time I checked at least one of the newer companies isn't even calling what they offer a blockchain. 
In the situation I'm imagining there wouldn't be any token, so no user transactions as we know them anyway. I think the main desired characteristics are distributed consensus between banks or other financial institutions, immutable ledger(depending on how you define it considering the rollback case), and cryptographically secure. As well as some advantages for auditing and such. The whole thing isn't really comparable to Bitcoin at all and part of the confusion here stems from people thinking that they want to recreate their own version of Bitcoin or something and that doesn't seem to be the case at all. It wouldn't even really have much to do with Bitcoin at all if some the proposed solutions didn't happen to use the blockchain data structure.

Important part in the a 20k transaction will be comparing the spread he gets for his USD to EUR transaction versus 20k USD to BTC and then BTC to EUR transaction(Bitcoin replacement here would eat the spread twice). Assuming he starts with USD and wants to end with EUR of course.
Unless his bank is badly ripping him off(not impossible! :P) medium to large wire transfers should still generally be cheaper than using Bitcoin at this point in time. If liquidity goes through the roof and we get ultra low spreads at some point and international exit points that also don't gouge on the BTC spread it will be more competitive.

I'm neutral here for the most part, but from my observations over the years I certainly understand why a large part of the user base feels like they were mislead about the viability of Bitcoin itself to scale. I don't think anyone is at fault, but people asking questions over the years about Bitcoin's ability to scale were constantly shut down with "Duh we'll just raise the blocks. No problem! Stop asking such stupid questions! Yes, Bitcoin scales.".
If the harsh reality is simply that Bitcoin can't scale in this way without putting the core value of decentralisation at risk, then so be it. But I think block size conservatives in general would do well to acknowledge that what Mike is saying here about that being what people signed up for isn't exactly bullshit. It's just another thing that the community has mislead itself on which we can add to the list.

I don't know about how it will go in the future post-spam attack, but for as long as I've been using Bitcoin there's lots of transactions that have a high enough priority to be sent with zero fee no problem. I think that's being changed or something so that coin age doesn't play a factor anymore, but I'm guessing they will keep transaction size as something that adds priority.

In general buying and selling BTC in Thailand is pretty easy, especially if you have a Thai bank account since you get instant free interbank p2p domestic transfers. But there aren't many actual places that accept BTC yet. It's not very well known with the local population at all. But liquidity is pretty good on places like Localbitcoins.

XT is not an altcoin. It's a Bitcoin candidate hard fork. If people switch to it then it's simply Bitcoin. If they don't then it's just a footnote in Bitcoin history.
If there's a true divide and we end up with two active blockchains, one being XT and the other being 1mb Bitcoin, then you might be able to make the case that we could call it an altcoin. But it would still be significantly different than the standard definition of the word altcoin that we've been using since 2011.

It doesn't at all unless you are required to receive actual BTC to an address you control.

Not as useful as Bitcoin, but if they made it similar enough so that you could send them and control your own private keys like Bitcoin it could be great for decentralised trading. Maybe when you redeem them for fiat you have to go through KYC or something. It would be a step up from what we have now though with centralised exchanges, so I wouldn't mind seeing what happened if they tried something like this.

One reason to care about the health of China's economy is that it appears that a large majority of bitcoin is mined in China at a few very large farms. Right now the Chinese government has no reason to care much about Bitcoin miners doing their thing out in the middle of nowhere. But if things got really bad economically in China, and Bitcoin was reacting to that by skyrocketing in value, the government now has a lot more incentive to take an 'interest' in our miners. Remember that this is an authoritarian communist(in name anyway) government. Worst case scenario would be a complete take over of all the mining operations, but even without that they could still be sticking their fingers in and gaining control other ways.
Nothing we can do about this though, so it's just kind of a 'lets just hope it doesn't ever happen' thing. It's a risk, but it's not inevitable or anything. We'll probably be ok. Especially if there's a shift away from China being the dominant mining country.

Seems to be enough resistance to that idea that it seems less likely that it's going to happen now though from what I can tell. Especially now that it seems that some people have taken the spam attack forcing people to use higher fees as the 'checkmate' moment for keeping blocks small. Not that larger block people ever thought that a fee market was impossible or anything.

I've noticed that there are some people who believe that Bitcoin to them should be a high fee settlement network. And during the spam attack when the so called fee market appeared it seemed that some of those people felt that their positions were vindicated by this. Some think that Bitcoin should be a tool of the rich, and that 'low quality' transactions should be handled by other chains or alternative methods of value transfer.
You're right that everyone wants what's best for Bitcoin. But people have vastly different interpretations of what Bitcoin is, or should be.

The thing is wire fees stay flat so in many cases they're quite reasonable for large international transactions. They can be horribly expensive for smaller ones though, definitely. 
The problem here is that for some odd reason the US banking system is around 15 years behind the rest of the world. Instant, often free, p2p interbank domestic transfers are absolutely standard all over the world. Why the US banking system has decided to ignore progress, I have no idea. The US operates in some very odd ways from an outside perspective. This comes up a lot on this sub in my experience. If you want to see it for yourself, go on Localbitcoins.com and see how many countries offer 'national bank transfer' as an option, and then notice how that common payment method disappears from the options for US trades. It's just so weird why the financial juggernaut of the world lags behind so much in areas like that. Who actually gains from that anyway? Is it a political thing? I digress, but it confuses me to no end.
In the mean time, yeah Bitcoin's utility can be much higher for people in the US who are handicapped by the stone age banking system. It's a good opportunity for people and companies to take advantage of a slow to adjust market.

I feel like you're comparing apples and oranges here though.
I get Bitcoin, and what benefits it can offer. But I'm trying to look at what's being said by banks and and financial community and see things through their eyes. 
What they seem to want pretty much has nothing to do with Bitcoin at all. There is a question of whether or not the blockchain data structure itself will be useful for their purposes, or if it's completely unnecessary, or if there already exists something that offers the same advantages without the need for a blockchain. So far the only thing that's come up in all of my discussions related to this is that Git could be modified in someway and provide similar benefits. There are also companies now that exist and are offering blockchain-without-Bitcoin or similar services, but I'm not familiar with the technical aspects of their services or what it is exactly that they offer.
Them using a blockchain data structure to run what will effectively be a distributed database also doesn't prevent them from taking advantage of anything that Bitcoin offers in the future. It's a totally separate thing.
@_date: 2015-07-07 12:34:49


Not so much for domestic p2p transfers at least. International transfers yeah. But lots of countries have free or close to free instant interbank p2p transfers.

I agree with with you. I just disagreed with the posters prediction that Bitcoin itself offers something that's so far above what's available for something specific like p2p transactions that's it's inevitably going to dominate that space. It has it's own specific advantages, but a lot of people seem to think that it's some how just destined to take over the world. Where as I think it's going to take a lot more work as well as people really pushing it where it has its strengths rather than trying to compete directly with Visa and MC or other consumer oriented services.

The point is that this 'blockchain technology' stuff seems to be completely different than Bitcoin. It's not a one or the other thing. People seem to be confusing the two. 
A calculator or a vanilla database doesn't provide the same benefits as a blockchain would. So my question is what alternatives to using the blockchain data structure exist, or which hypothetical technologies offer clear advantages. The only answer that I've come across so far as something that exists and is compatible is Git. And it would have to be modified, but it shares a lot of the same principals with how a blockchain works.

Call it what you want, it will either provide utility for an organization or it won't and they won't use it. The problem here seems to be that people are conflating these closed distributed consensus systems with something that has to do with Bitcoin or cryptocurrency in general, when in reality they're really not very related.
People here love to rattle off how they can achieve the same thing better with a database. So I'd advise them to go do so and collect the millions of dollars that would be thrown at you for doing so. I'm not being sarcastic, I'm sure theoretically someone could create some data system superior to what a blockchain data structure offers financial organizations now. The only thing is for now the blockchain exists and has been proven by 6 years of Bitcoin. I highly doubt the blockchain alone will be the end all be all of fintech. Blockchain is more of a catch all buzzword if anything right now that captures all these ideas.

I thought I read a couple things on here about some grassroots local or state governments trying to push through the ability to pay taxes and fees with Bitcoin. Not sure if anything ever came of that though.
Although I just realized that even if they did have this it would likely be something like Bitpay where they just autoconvert in to USD. So it would be more like using a foreign credit card or something that also has the ability to charge something in USD for a fee. So it kind of doesn't count really even if it was possible.

One person controlling that much bitcoin adds to the risk profile of Bitcoin.
Even if we think we know that Satoshi would never use it in a way that would harm Bitcoin, it's not easy to explain to outsiders that the anonymous creator is holding a stash so large that it could easily wipe-out billions in value in a short period of time.
He wouldn't have to destroy it all. But having over a million BTC is a bit excessive.
One could even make the argument that Satoshi destroying x amount of Bitcoin publicly could potentially have positive expected value in the long run for the remainder of his BTC. From increased confidence in Bitcoin and reduction in the total supply. Now that's far from guaranteed, but there is definitely some value that would result from coins destroyed in that manner.

It would be a good thing for a more accurate estimate of actual commerce done through Bitcoin.

Not sure that's exactly true. I'd say that bitcoin.org is clearly the defacto 'official' Bitcoin site. What is different though compared to other official sites and centralised projects is that if the community wanted a new site to be the 'official' one, they could easily promote it as the new 'official' Bitcoin site.
Kind of a semantic issue I guess. It's like considering Bitcoin Core to be the official implementation(or reference implementation) of Bitcoin.

Git provides the distributed part, the cryptographic signing part, and the history part. In it's current form it's not applicable but so far it's the *only* existing technology that anyone has mentioned that comes close to meeting a similar feature set that using a blockchain data structure provides. It would obviously have to be forked and modified, but it shares some similarity with blockchains. I notice that it's often brought up in these types of discussions.
What existing technology is there that provides the same feature set? I'm not saying that it doesn't exist, I honestly don't know, but so far no ones been able to point to anything similar. I know that there are many types of databases, a handful of cryptographic signing software suites, probably some interesting software for distributed data too. All the individual parts exist most certainly. But I'm not aware of anything that has packaged up all the features that a blockchain provides yet in an alternative format. Mainly the distributed consensus, cryptographically secure, immutability, and publicly available and auditable parts. Other than a couple of companies that claim to offer something that sounds similar. And they often get disparaged on here as offering snake oil or other insults. I don't know much about the companies and for all I know they could be scams as people say on here, but there's a few things that indicate they're probably not with just a quick google, but they're not really what I'm trying to find out here with my post.
It would also be trivial to modify one of the existing open source cryptocurrency projects in to one where the blocks are signed by the participants rather than mined by PoW. In fact now that I typed that out I think there's one already operating like that now. So there doesn't seem to be a big technical barrier to using a blockchain in this manner at all.
It's quite possible that we will soon see alternatives to using a blockchain to achieve similar results, but I still can't find any existing technology that compares. 
@_date: 2015-07-17 16:04:06


You've used this terminology before. I highly disagree with calling it an altcoin. The word 'altcoin' already has years of established usage in this community and using that word in this way only results in more confusing rhetoric for people.

Citicoin backed by Citibank would be really great. If it was redeemable for fiat it would enable a new generation of decentralised exchanges that could use Citicoin as the replacement of a centralised fiat gateway. Yes, Citicoin is centralised when it comes down to it, but if it can be used in a similar manner to the way cryptos are used today you would have more control.

They've probably already bought it but the money supply inflation rate from mining is over a million dollars a day at around $275. That's a lot of demand that needs to be sustained. 
There's a reason why so many Bitcoiners(myself included) weren't just buying up all the $10 BTC they could. High prices just don't make a lot of sense on paper until the mining subsidy decreases substantially.
 
That 'euphoric' pump to $1200 though was certainly something. But now all these rich guys and girls know about Bitcoin, the Chinese know about Bitcoin, and we're at a point where we really need to move beyond pure speculation and find some real use cases with real value. An actual Bitcoin economy has to be built at some point if Bitcoin has any chance of sustaining high prices.
@_date: 2015-04-25 09:37:32

How could a PoW sidechain even work if by definition all the tokens of value on the sidechain are backed by sequestered bitcoin? Where is the financial incentive to mine coming from if the tokens are only generated by bitcoin and not solving blocks as would normally be the case? Are they expected to run via some social consensus where people mine the blocks because they want to support the network similarly to how people run Bitcoin nodes now?
The centralised blockchain thing makes the most sense with a central entity making money via fees or similar. That would explain Blockstream's existence and answers a lot of the questions surrounding their existence. Not sure how people will feel about that though if that turns out to be the case.

Yes, that's more accurate than the way I put it.
The idea of funding development was and is a good one of course, but the foundation ended up being a nonstop source of drama. 
And I think you're right that the PR problems/scandals have probably resulted in dwindling memberships. And that combined with a poorly performing BTC probably led the foundation to its current state of apparent bankruptcy.
It will be interesting to see the numbers if they release them at some point to see if that's what happened.

Sure there is if the value of the double spend is higher than the value you might lose from the blocks you might miss.
And in this guys case the the cost for him to try double spending was zero, even with only ~25% of the hashing. So it was free for him to double spend as he did and steal from that dice site. 
Obviously when he gets caught he's going to be fired from Ghash, but in the mean time ignoring the moral implications of doing what he did, he certainly had the economic incentive to double spend as he did.

I thought this was pretty obvious considering all the public connections.
And my impression was that they were specifically trying to show this as well. To lend support to the idea that BIP 101 had the support of Silicon Valley behind it.
You say it like it's a negative thing, but I'd expect many to consider it a positive. As they see SV and big finance in general as one of the only ways that realistically will be able to grow Bitcoin in the coming years since it's already well known in the main stream media and such. 
Personally, I don't have much of an opinion either way with regards to BIP 101 or the reliance on SV and big finance though. Just my guesses and observations about how I think some people in the community view things.
@_date: 2015-09-04 15:04:50
Yeah, I feel like there's always been a good amount of people who just got in to it because they were interested in the technology, rather than political reasons. And since there interests aren't political they tend not to discuss it much, where as some people with other motivations might. And since the political group in general is more vocal, it's easy to get the impression that it's a very large majority of the community. 
It definitely was a much higher percentage of people getting in to Bitcoin for political reasons before though compared to now, so I agree with you there for sure.. But a lot of people also came from slashdot and other tech gateways, as Bitcoin was frequently discussed around the interest even before the first bubble to $32. And then after that even more frequently.

Yes, but the big players should still have a big advantage with their chip fabrication. They should always be one step ahead at least of the general consumer public who buys end user miners and pays for specialized hosting. At least that's my impression from seeing news about the latest chips that Bitmain, KnC and others create. They always get first crack at getting as much value out of the newest generation of silicon.
I'm not super tuned in to modern mining at this point since it's not really a hobbist type activity any longer. So I could be wrong and there are companies producing and selling the most advanced ASICs directly to consumers now. But that would seem weird since I don't think that would be in their best interest financially.

They raised nine figures as a hardware company and seem to have gone through many ideas and prototypes that didn't work out over the last two years. It sounds like they've created some interesting software that might enable Bitcoin commerce, which is great of course. But is that software going to create a return on the large VC investment? Probably not, since everyone demands open source. Left with this situation it's possible that wrapping up their software in some custom hardware is the only viable way they see to monetize it.
I hope their next effort is in the hardware wallet area. I think there's still a lot of potential there for a great, secure hardware wallet with a good UX that enables people to confidently use bitcoin in their daily lives.

Do you expect it to be open source? Decentralised? Genuine question, not trying to be negative. I'm extremely curious about what their software stack that they're talking about will be like. When I've brought it up some people think it will be a centralised Changetip type system. But I think there's the possibility that they've done something interesting with payment channels or something similar.
Someone else mentioned that the microtransactions will be no-fee transactions that only get included when 21 Inc mines a block. Which would make them all on chain as well as potentially pretty slow to confirm depending on their mining power and luck. Not sure what I think about this one yet. Doesn't seem like it would work with 1 mb block limits if there really are a lot of these no-fee microtransactions.

And someone who's more tuned in to the cutting edge of Bitcoin mining can correct me if I'm wrong here, but even  with some of the more modern ASICs, the idea of running enough of them in your electronics and actually making profit where power costs are fairly high(most places) seems unlikely as well. *Especially* if 21 is taking 75% of the mined coins as the article suggests.
Hopefully someone who knows what's going on can come tell my that this article is way off or that I'm missing something here.

In theory they(or 'we') could change the algorithm to something like that. But with so much invested in SHA256 I'm pretty sure that's never going to happen.
It would be nice though if mining could be done with general purpose computing that also performed valuable research or something. I've heard of a couple of projects that tried to head in that direction but I don't think anything ever came of it.

I guess in this case I just prefer form over function.

That kind of makes sense though, right? The late adopters by and large bought to speculate on price increases. If most of them are in the red, then many won't see the point of spending their BTC yet.

Where does the economic incentive come from running these sidechains? Mining, nodes, whatever. 
Is it the same sort of thing we have now with people running Bitcoin nodes? i.e. people do it because it's necessary even though they don't reap any direct economic gain. 
So are the sidechains basically going to be secured by social consensus? I don't see any way to reward people when every unit of account on a sidechain is supposed to be generated from the equivalent amount in sequestered BTC.

I feel like a lot of this BIP 100 and BIP 101 talk is wasted since it's already been made quite clear that neither of them are getting merged in to Bitcoin Core. And it's unlikely that anyone is going to be moving away from Core anytime soon as well unless there's something major that happens. And I don't think anyone else is going to try something as aggressive as XT, so it's just something that people will have to accept.
I feel like either there should be some new BIPs proposed, or people shift the discussion to BIP 102 and BIP 103/sipa. As 102 and 103 haven't been dismissed outright as far as I can tell. And I don't think they're nearly as contentious, and contention seems to be Wladimir's primary factor when choosing what not to merge.
I don't really have a personal position on the blocksize debate, but I can't help but notice that there are large groups of people promoting these options which appear to have no chance of getting merged. So I find it a bit curious that discussion continues regardless. 
@_date: 2015-09-03 08:24:04

@_date: 2015-09-03 21:37:42
The thing is that the general idea behind BIP 100 has been around now for a long while and doesn't really address the concerns raised by other devs about jeopardizing decentralisation. I don't have an opinion on that specifically, but I would be surprised if they had changed their views in the mean time. Sipa's BIP is a good example of just how far off his(and probably others) opinion is on what constitutes a safe block size. And I'm not so sure that they would be comfortable with giving big miners a vote on something that they claim benefits them directly(bigger blocks).
My perception of their opinions could be totally wrong here of course. I can't speak for anyone, but have been following along here for a while and unless I've missed something I don't think BIP 100 is something that they would support.
I could see them supporting Jeff's BIP 102 as a stop gap measure until sidechains and LN end up becoming a reality and we have a better idea of what can be done and what will be needed. But if there was a prediction market about whether BIP 100 would get merged in to Core, I'd be betting against. I think the amount of miners and community members is giving people the impression there's consensus there, and I'm not so sure there is. But would be happy to be shown otherwise.
@_date: 2015-09-24 15:13:17


I think that's a bit harsh. It's been two years and I'm sure the pressure to put out *something* was probably mounting. They've surely invested tons of money in to chip fabrication and many different hardware prototypes. The only thing I'm guessing is that it's turned out that software rules all and there are very few legit cases where specialized hardware is needed to leverage Bitcoin.

It could, but personally I think specialized mining conglomerates will continue to dominate Bitcoin mining for the forseeable future(and possibly forever).

I'd actually agree with you if that was the case. There are a lot of ancaps in the community, sure. But how many of them are in positions of influence over the technical parts of Bitcoin? Are any of the Core devs even ancaps?
There are some successful and influential business people who are ancaps like Roger Ver and Erik Voorhees. But I think most of the tech people and engineers probably don't subscribe to such extremist positions, since they tend to recognize the inherent trade offs in different systems.
I could be wrong here of course. And if I am I'd be interested to hear who the anarchists are. :)

Do you think that this has any chance of becoming what Wladimir would consider 'non-contentious' and therefore merged in to Core? It's great that you've have stepped up and done a lot of work here since you first released the draft a couple months ago or whatever. But my impression is that there are still a considerable amount of devs, and three Core devs specifically(Wlad, Pieter, Greg) that haven't publicly acknowledged that BIP 100 might be a viable choice to be merged in to Core. 
I mean, you clearly have a lot of support from miners and community members already. And I'd imagine that this support has probably motivated you to continue fleshing out your proposal. But you would know better than I for sure: Do you think BIP 100 has a chance of passing Wlad's threshold for what he considers 'contentious', and therefore possibly merged in to Core? In your discussions with them, are the other devs in general acknowledging the possibility of agreeing on your proposal? 
Or if it continues to gain support from the community, and that support becomes overwhelming, but lacks enough dev/Core dev support to qualify as 'non-contentious', are you prepared to take further steps if you feel there's enough support behind you?

Sure the volume is much higher than the total amount mined, but around $275 we're already talking about a million dollars worth of BTC being created. That's a lot of supply that needs to be met with demand. And we seem to be able to meet almost that amount anyway, which is good, but how many millions of dollars can really be supported? When you start getting in to the four digits and multiple millions it will take a complete paradigm shift to sustain those prices over any reasonable amount of time. 
Now that could definitely happen if Wall St. decides BTC is a worth while asset to speculate on, or some truly unique use cases appear causing demand to sky rocket. But it's a lot of fresh money that constantly needs to flow in. Over the years this will get better with the halvings though of course too.
If there was someway to cut production in line with demand that would be amazing. But I don't think anyone's even come close to solving that problem in a trustless and decentalised way.
@_date: 2015-09-03 10:52:48
They can only do that when running XT as it has BIP 101 implemented already. Them mining blocks now signaling their approval for BIP 101 does nothing but let people know that they would support BIP 101 if it was implemented. 100% of blocks could be flagged like this and nothing would happen. Mining an actual BIP 101 block would just be rejected by the network since everyone overwhelmingly runs Core.

If they end up paying out a claim for that I'd imagine fraudsters will see it as a huge opportunity to capitalize on. 
@_date: 2015-09-03 12:07:51
I think mostly because of two scenarios: first being if XT completely takes over and renders Core irrelevant and incompatible that would mean a lot of devs would likely be no longer involved in the project. And the second being that some people think that if say only the 75% needed to trigger XT's hardfork stay with XT and the remaining 25% actually continue to mine the old chain then we'll end up with two active blockchains. Not sure how realistic that one is, but it could happen theoretically if the remaining miners were serious about keeping enough hash power on the old chain to keep it moving.

If this device gets sold and picked up by the media as some necessary piece of hardware that enables people to conduct commerce with Bitcoin, then yes it could potentially be harmful to public perception of the openness of Bitcoin. It might misinform some people in to thinking that Bitcoin requires custom hardware to be useful, when in reality it's meant to be permissionless and universal. Usable on any general purpose computing device that can run a wallet.
I'm not saying that this is going to happen. I certainly hope it does not. And I also hope that they don't sell it like that. I'm more concerned about the media misinterpreting the device and posing it as something that's integral to participate in Bitcoin commerce.

I've always wondered why people seem to ignore the fact that the biggest target in Bitcoin are the huge mining operations. Chinese government could easily step in at any time given some incentive to do so.

I'd expect it to be some form of PoS and weakly decentralized at best. They could pregenerate coins and instantly exceed Bitcoin's market cap and liquidity if they wanted to.

Main difference I think is that the transaction in this case happens on the Visa network in dollars from the BTC you preloaded on your card. While with something like Bitpay you're sending BTC directly to Bitpay on the blockchain for each purchase and they convert it to fiat for the vendor. Slightly different, but better user experience with the debit card in my opinion.
I think products like the Xapo debit card have a good future since it truly allows you to spend your BTC on whatever you want essentially. If we ever get Bitcoin debit or credit cards with rewards and such then that would be even better.

There's a wide range of ways that this could be done. It's not as black and white as you're making it out to be. And saying that using a decentralised token is no more decentralised than Paypal is just wrong. Just because there has to be an entity at the end of the line that will exchange tokens for fiat does not mean that there is no benefit to having every other link in the chain decentralised. Consider the situation where you had $100 in fiat tokens, and you didn't want to, or couldn't redeem them for whatever reason, and you offered them to me for 95 cents on the dollar in Bitcoin. We use a decentralised platform to make a secure trustless exchange and we're both happy. That is a hell of a lot better then your $100 being frozen forever in Paypal's clutches.

Well, Gavin was working for free for a long time, so at least the idea behind creating an entity that would be able to fund his work has merit.
I think it's pretty much everything else other than that which has been controversial from the start. It's just been pretty weird from the start. Too much political wrangling and sketchy people involving themselves. 
It would be good to have developers directly funded on Lighthouse or something without the need for a politicized organization. And if people want to fund a politicized organization they can do it separately from developer funding and keep the two things away from each other.

The thing is that Bitcoin mining has evolved over the years to be something that's done profitably only at scale. And often in extreme conditions like in sub-arctic areas or specially subsidized electricity zones in China. Most people can't even make money mining at home with their own full sized ASIC racks, so the idea that the mining evolution we've observed thus far is going to drastically change is kind of odd and doesn't make a lot of sense based on what we know about efficiency.
No one is going to want to run a node either. Now that's something that actually takes significant resources for the average person. Enthusiasts and businesses will continue to provide us with our nodes, no problem there really.
People have talked about this idea for a long time. It would have been pretty good in 2011 with GPUs all the way up until 2013 probably. But now we're talking about 2015 and beyond at a time when their mining competitors are also very well funded giants with access to technology and ultra cheap power.
I mean, I hope I'm wrong and they have some vastly superior ASIC that they've developed which will let them compete with the mega farms and such. But that would imply that they've managed to beat China at their own game, which I kind of find unlikely.

Yes I agree. And even harder to compete when not only is it free, but many cards have rewards and cash back which from what I've seen can easily be worth 2 to 5% of the purchase. Which is pretty good, and very tough to beat.

It could very well be that their software is really slick and great to use. A lot of people won't be interested in purchasing what they would see as redundant hardware though.

It's consistent with the naiveity shown from the start imo. Posting on Bitcointalk and Shroomery to promote SR with his own username and email. Posting that silly blurb on his LinkedIn as well.
I think he was scammed and no one was ever hurt. But it would appear when he sent that BTC that he actually thought this person was arranging hits for him. I believe the transactions are on the blockchain.

@_date: 2015-03-16 11:09:18
I'm not making any claims. I'm offering my opinion based on the information that's been publicly presented. 
By asking if there's contrary evidence I'm making it clear that I'm open to consider any additional information that implies that Ross didn't believe that he was paying to have those people killed. 
Also, I'm not the one who's supposed to be *supporting* Ross. Choosing to publicly support Ross implies to me either they believe that he didn't order the killings or that those actions aren't sufficient to  make him someone who's not worth supporting. When you see people with very public, vocal, strong beliefs like Julia and Cody supporting Ross it makes you wonder what their internal justifications are for choosing Ross specifically. Maybe they know something I don't. But the blockchain adds an additional layer of evidence in addition to the chat logs which makes it quite a leap of faith in my opinion to take the 'Ross is innocent' stance.
And the fact that the payment for the hits is on the blockchain is quite significant. I'd really like to hear how anyone has formed the opinion that Ross was not behind those chats.
@_date: 2015-03-18 06:30:25
5 People.
@_date: 2015-03-16 16:26:03
Because it's easy for people against the idea to point out that despite meaning to reduce violence and provide a safer environment, five people could have been killed had redandwhite been who he said he was. That's assuming you believe the evidence though. If it turns out somehow that Ross did in fact practice the non-violence that he preached then it's a lot less hypocritical and a much stronger argument.
I'd rather people support other people or other projects that actually live up to their philosophy.

Wouldn't the ones who care about that data be the ones who are logging, and thus more likely to just lie and say they aren't logging? I'd kind of expect every server just to say they don't log.

Trezor is open source so a Chinese company decided to manufacture knock-offs and sell them at a 75% discount to Satoshi Labs' official Trezor. In response to that Satoshi Labs attempted to retroactively change the licence to some Microsoft one that doesn't permit the same free and open source use that other open source licences permit. This made a lot of people angry so they eventually reverted it, but not without a lot of people getting bent out of shape over the whole situation.

That's a reasonable position. But I'm mainly concerned with all the people in the Bitcoin community who are actively supporting him and painting him as some sort of hero. These same people claim non-violent voluntary action as a core belief. 
If people want to stay neutral and not make a conclusion either way then that's fine with me. But the people who are supporting him should be able justify their actions imo. They might just think that creating SR overshadows the murder for hire stuff or something and that he did more good than bad, I don't know. It's confusing to see so many people actively supporting him though.

When I buy small plastic twist ties from China that cost less than $0.01 each, it doesn't necessitate a lower denomination than the penny.
Denominations are matter of convenience and have no effect on the pricing of items outside of some unrelated pricing psychology(99 cents ect). 
No new money is created. I still get 5 plastic things for a penny. I effectively pay $0.002 for them whether or not fraction of pennies actually exist or not.

I can only speculate that it's his complete lack of critical thinking that enabled this whole scam to go as far as it did. The scariest part of it is that he actually might have legitimately thought for a bit there that this whole scheme had a chance of working.

As much as I would like to believe that would be true I am almost certain that this would never happen. Even with a tested and fully robust PoS algorithm, there's far too much either irrational hate towards PoS, or entrenched financial interests like the mining industry.
Even now with new research papers being done by PhDs on PoS, there's been absolutely no interest by mainstream Bitcoiners. All people do is link to the old 'Nothing at Stake' paper and ignore the newer research. The lack of critique and interest is very disappointing in my view and I just don't understand the negativity towards PoS.

But I have seen evidence both through the chat logs and on the blockchain.
The only argument that people here seem to make to cast that information in to doubt is something along the lines of 'the government made it all up'. Which is possible, but doesn't explain the transactions on the blockchain that perfectly match to the murder for hire chats. 
Yes, by deault I wouldn't form an opinion either way before seeing evidence. But in this case there's already been ample evidence presented. I think the probability of him being innocent is quite small. I'd be interested in hearing from people who feel that he's innocent though.

I think Bitcoin already mainstreamed in 2013. Not sure how much more mainstream its going to get than that. It's possible we get a similar amount of media coverage again at some point and maybe even a bit more but I can't imagine it being much different than 2013 was. 
2011 was pretty mainstream too for a short burst. But it was more about Silk Road at that point than it was about Bitcoin itself. But considering Congressmen were  making public statements about Bitcoin its safe to say it hit mainstream in 2011 too.

In the demonstration video I watched for IBM's IoT ethereum fork they also had a representative from Samsung there showing off their own work. IBM showed how your washing machine could automatically order detergent for you when you're low using their Ethereum fork for example(why a credit card isn't sufficient, I don't know). But comapnies like IBM and Samsung who make domestic appliances could work together to issue tokens that are backed by value that are designed to be interoperable with all these IoT devices that are supposedly going to be ubiquitous at some point.

Coinbase is compelled to do what they do by the US government. They almost certainly would rather not reject as many customers as they do, as well as expending what must be signifigant resources and man power enforcing these rules. 
BTC-e seemingly has no oversight at all and are free to do as they wish. The fact that they've chosen now to make a stand is quite interesting and is definitely a pivotal point in Bitcoin history.

In the eyes of the law, sure. 
In reality I've seen an overwhelming amount of evidence to indicate that Ross intended to have five people murdered through his chats with redandwhite.
If there's any evidence to the contrary to show that it wasn't him or that it was fabricated I'd be happy to consider it. I wish that those logs didn't show that and he could be the person people are presenting him to be. But logically I can't just dismiss the evidence and pretend it didn't happen.

Xoom, TransferWise, or any other modern company is vastly cheaper than what you're suggesting. I'm sure even WU is too. Crypto is not nearly as competitive as you seem to think it is when you consider the fact that you need to eat the spread twice. Not to mention the volatility.
It might be competitive in the short run. But in the medium and long term a centralised company that only needs to move numbers around in a database will almost certainly out compete something with as much overhead as Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-03-03 15:25:47


I highly doubt that. 3600 BTC mined a day at 10k would mean adding $36,000,000 in value per day. Keeping up even a fraction of that supply increase requires a hell of a lot of demand that hasn't been shown to exist yet. And he failures of a few shitty businesses certainly didn't somehow prevent that demand imo.
Bitcoin's inflationary nature makes high prices extremely difficult to sustain. Something magical has to happen for it to really get to those levels and stay there. Maybe there's a killer app out there for BTC that we don't know yet, but so far it's mostly a solution looking for a problem unfortunately. :/

I'm not so sure a microtrust provider like ChangeTip really needs to be decentralised. The sidechain part definitely sounds like overkill and introduces a whole other set of questions. The micropyment channels thing might be alright, but again for this specific application it sounds kind of unnecessary.
Of all the things that can be acceptably centralised I feel like companies like ChangeTip really are a good case. Microtrust provider dealing with small amounts of money and often acting as a gateway to introduce new users to Bitcoin. User experience is going to be their most important thing I'd imagine, and if that gets sacrificed to create something that's decentralised just for the sake of it, then I feel that might be a mistake.

Now that you put it that way it's kind of interesting how the conversation related to Ripple is completely dominated by impressions of XRP.

I counted 15/29(30 - BTC) being original. Not counting Darkcoin and such since it's a fork. Even though there is significant additional work build on it.
A handful of them are bs/fake market caps like Banxshares, Rimbit ect.
PoS debate is still on but there's been very little written against it since Andrew Polestra's opinion piece back in May of last year. And lots and lots of positive research and articles since then so I think we're likely heading towards a tested and robust PoS system some time in the near future. I wish more PoS detractors would go and criticize Vitalik/Bytemaster/Kushti(and other NXT devs) recent writings more, as there hasn't really been much resistance from what I've seen. It seems as if a lot of people though that Polestra's writing was the final word on PoS and that was it. When that doesn't appear to be the case at all.

I agree with you on both points. I'm not sure why people are downvoting you. Who *wouldn't* want Bitcoin to stop inflating right now if it was possible. Having millions of dollars mined per day when the price rises sucks.
@_date: 2015-03-02 18:03:56
Which one is a mining pool?
Volumes are still pretty low in general but it's still the best decentralised exchange right now. Especially considering you can just use BTC on it.
The fact that most assets have less than 1 million market cap isn't too surprising either considering it's still relatively new and it's not that easy just to create a business that's worth over a million dollars.
I just like the idea that there's an actual decentralised exchange out there. Even if it's not really reaching its potential yet. Not sure why most Bitcoin people aren't interested in it more considering it adds value to Bitcoin(imo).
@_date: 2015-02-04 10:14:05


But these are the charges that actually matter. The drugs stuff is whatever. The fact that he apparently took steps to get five people killed, whether or not it actually happened is the real crime here.

I just asked this to the other person who replied:
When the peg is created, and say I sequester 1 BTC to say 10 xcoin, where are these xcoins coming from? Does the act of putting the 1 BTC in the two-way peg cause the sidechain to mint 10 new xcoins? If the peg is at 10:1, does that mean in this example there could only ever be 210 million xcoins ever to exist(and this would only happen if every single Bitcoin was sequestered)? What about people mining the xcoin chain? I understand that they can merge mine with Bitcoin, but where would the reward come from for mining xcoin? Transaction fees?

I don't understand how sidechains relegate an alt to a second class citizen under Bitcoin. If anything doesn't it make it more likely that an alt with superior technology might surpass Bitcoin since it's given some sort of direct link to siphon off Bitcoin's already established network effect?
Seems like lots of people see sidechains has the 'death of alts', but just looks like they're all about to go from fringe speculative investment to legitimate alternative.
I don't really mind, as if this ends up being a Trojan horse(in the classical sense) it will probably result in better technology for us all. But the whole idea of sequestered Bitcoins and a two-way peg doesn't make Bitcoin itself any less vulnerable to competition imo. Unless I'm missing something here where there is some element of protectionism baked in to the concept.

They could provide enough nodes to offset any nodes that stay on the old rule set. The big issue would be that the 'real' chain's difficulty would be so high that blocks would take forever, while the miners new chain would be running smoothly. If you had a business that depended on Bitcoin for income you might just say fuck it and switch because you were left with no choice.
@_date: 2015-03-22 18:07:16
While we're on the subject here: What's the incentive for miners to secure the chain? If each unit of currency is two-way pegged to some amount of BTC by the protocol, newly mined coins(incentive for miners) need to be pegged as well, but where does the BTC for the peg come from those mined coins?
Minting coins by sequestering BTC makes sense. But that seems like the only way to generate coins on the sidechain, minting new ones from mining doesn't sound possible without creating an imbalance of coins backed by BTC and those which aren't.

And a lot of random people tipping in the hundreds. was one of them I think, and he's still around. 
I don't understand why ChangeTip limits the amount to $25. But it could just be the exact reason in the comic. But that time when everyone was super happy about their new found riches with BTC was a lot of fun, and lots of regular people took notice of Bitcoin when they saw these amazing tips being handed out on reddit. I'd say it was probably the best promotion of Bitcoin I've seen. Real money gets peoples attention, not fractions of a cent. :/

Many people here don't see it that way and think Bitcoin is a tool to further their political agenda. This naturally creates some friction and might hinder adoption if it's too closely aligned with extremist political views.
Personally I would like Bitcoin to be neutral, but I seem to be a minority(or perhaps part of a silent majority).
@_date: 2015-02-12 07:37:30
Yeah, that's what we do. Convince retailers to accept Bitcoin because it's the "biggest thing since the internet" and then no one actually uses it. :P

I was pretty shocked by this too, but when I asked someone else they explained it as the gateway who issues you their tokens can 'freeze' them. Like BitstampUSD or similar. If you were a criminal or something Bitstamp themselves would freeze their own tokens that you control. Similar to how they could freeze your BTC in your Bitstamp account now. Nothing different than how it currently is really. Not Ripple labs themselves freezing your money. 
Not sure if that's entirely accurate, but it makes a lot more sense then Ripple Labs having full control over everything.

It's annoyed me over the years how little exposure Electrum gets considering it actually solves a lot of peoples complaints with Bitcoin. Hopefully with the new release coming up and some community love everyone will get a chance to try it at least.

It's a socially enforced incentive. Community needs people running nodes else there's no network. Ideally there would be a small monetary incentive too. Maybe in time Lighthouse could be used to help fund some people who run nodes or something.

There's already been a smart contract system compatible with Bitcoin developed by CIYAM called AT. But the Bitcoin community as a whole hasn't been interested. Gavin did show up in one of the threads and he had some concern with what would happen on a reorg. But beyond that I don't think there's been any significant interest from other people in Bitcoin.
I don't really know why people wouldn't be all over this as it adds a whole new dimension to Bitcoin and makes it more competitive with 2.0 technology that's out there.

Yeah, if they don't like Bitcoin for whatever reason it's just a matter of time before someone in the government there realizes that if they want to they can control it.

I don't know. Maybe it's just the node that relays the block? I know that I see an IP on blockchain.info when blocks are mined, but I'm not sure exactly how the process goes.
So if I mine a block, I announce it to the network through a node(which is presumably my own node to minimize the chance of orphans?)?
Yeah, I don't know how this process works exactly but I'm curious.

You're assuming that they would use SHA256, which is probably unlikely.

The community should really take a more aggressive stand against the bad actors in the Bitcoin media space like CCN, Cryptoarticles, NewsBTC and more.
Some sort of public analysis and discussion with everyone here that could lead to the bad ones being blacklisted from r/bitcoin. And maybe a sidebar note listing the sources that are considered harmful and/or unethical.
Probably never going to happen, but it would be nice to see some market justice for once.

Using SuperNET with BBR + Teleport/Telepathy will be similar to using XMR with I2P integration. And with SuperNET you'll be able to do stuff cross chain with Bitcoin and such so it should end up being a good option. Effectively similar to how Maxwell and Poelstra's sidechain proposal works out but without an actual sidechain.

MillyBitcoin(millibitcoin) is a cartoon character meant to help teach people about Bitcoin. It's not like he's going around saying 'i'm a grill ;)' or anything from what I've seen. 
In my experience I see him doing a pretty good job of calling out the bs that is so prevalent in the Bitcoin community. His 'agenda' looks to me like it's just making people aware of how some people in this community try to use Bitcoin as a way to advance their extremist political views. If anything his agenda is simply 'anti-agenda'.
@_date: 2015-03-19 17:06:37
It's just ChangeTip though. They're well funded and the amounts that people should be keeping on their system are very small(and this  should probably be enforced too). They don't even let people tip over $25 so they're already signaling to people that they're really just meant for p2p micropayments.
I can't really imagine a situation where they as a company would really think they have much to gain from doing that. They're going to be making money off high volume microtransactions and even if they could take any any excess funds and invest them elsewhere I'm not even sure if the risk is worth the reward. They have investors to answer to and I'm not sure too many people would be interested in investing in the next round if their due diligence showed that ChangeTip was investing most of the BTC on their system in Bitcoin "investments" like GAW or something. :P As a startup they're definitely in it for growth and are expecting to eventually reach huge valuations and I wouldn't expect them to take many risks that might cost them a big round of funding. 
Plus if people are really concerned and there was demand for it people could request that they set up one of these cryptographic proof of reserve things that everyone keeps mentioning these days.

I really don't see either of these scenarios likely at all personally. I think there's a very wide range of situations that Bitcoin can be in over the next few years. Some quite positive, and some stagnating, but these long tail scenario speculations are a constant in the Bitcoin community and I don't understand why. I've noticed a lot of people in Bitcoin have this strange 'all or nothing', black or white mindset, especially with their political views. Very few shades of grey around here.

Seems the free market of cryptocurrencies has an inherent built in market failure. New and potentially superior technology gets automatically dismissed by most.

Sure it can improve privacy when implemented correctly. But I've gotten the distinct impression from people involved in crypto anonymity related projects that Coinjoin itself is simply not going to provide anonymity with any strong level of confidence.

Bitcoin has much higher inflation than gold doesn't it? I thought I read somewhere that there was only around 2% more gold mined per year depending on how the market is.
We're still looking at 10% and then 5% inflation for a long time so it's going to be really tough to sustain a high price for long. Another bubble though is quite possible.

No. You can still buy 10 candy bars for what we consider a satoshi today(0.00000001). The the unit smaller than a satoshi(0.000000001) can buy 1 candy bar now. Nothing has changed, the 9th place after the decimal is simply worth 1/10th of a satoshi. And 1/10th of a satoshi buys 1 candy bar. The value of a satoshi never changes and it still buys 10 candy bars like it did before. 
Even if we added one hundred decimal places, it doesn't have any affect on the value of BTC.
You're way off here.
@_date: 2015-02-23 18:46:02
It's not really an alt at all though. You can use Bitcoin with SuperNET and take advantage of the features of included alts. You can stay 100% in BTC but use privacy enhancing services and such. Pretty good news for BTC imo.
@_date: 2015-02-19 14:30:06
Yeah for sure. But by then there will probably be other technology already existing that offers an alternative if people aren't satisfied with Bitcoin.

Wow, lol. That's a first for me hearing that.
@_date: 2015-02-20 17:27:50
Even if that were true, and I don't remember any specific threat related to the police, FrendlyChemist threatened to leak data from the site which is really starting to stretch it if you consider that a violent act. Yes, obviously police would be interested in that information, but leaking it is not the same. 
And Tony and his three other housemates had made zero threats and the context was just Ross wanting to wipe out a scammer. No violence. And the fact that he had three other unknown people in his house didn't matter to Ross. He didn't seem to have any problem with having them all killed.

Lots of people have had contact with him. He's fairly active in the alt currency space.
@_date: 2015-02-16 17:21:42
With this hypothetical superior currency, what value is Bitcoin giving it at that point? Sure, at the start Bitcoin shared its network effect with it, allowing Bitcoin users to use it and swtich over easily. But after a certain point what value does Bitcoin offer the sidechain to stay pegged? I'm just not sure I see the incentive. It sounds more like Bitcoin will bootstrap alts in a way that was never possible before and by doing this there is less incentive to improve the core Bitcoin technology. In the short run everyone is happy as Bitcoin users get to use all the new tech, but in the long run it doesn't make a ton of sense to stick with Bitcoin unless people feel some sort of moral obligation to miners and early adopters. 
Not that I really care too much either way. I'm happy as long as things are progressing, sidechains or Bitcoin itself. But sidechains could end up cannibalizing Bitcoin eventually.

@_date: 2015-02-05 15:28:20


Yeah, all of these points confuse me. And didn't Truthcoin say they were going to have a presale? How can they do that if the coins are supposed to be pegged to a specific BTC value.
If a chain starts with a non zero amount of coins, it sounds like it would be like a game of musical chairs with regards to redeeming them for BTC. Almost like a fractional reserve of sorts. There could be 100 BTC sequestered, but 200 BTC worth of coins on the sidechain.
@_date: 2015-03-11 14:54:14
If they could profitably raise fees elsewhere, why haven't they done so already? What you're saying implies to me that they're not already maximizing their profit.

Ah, I see. You're right that was a long time before SuperNET. I wonder how relevant MegaNET will be to Bitcoin and other cryptos.

@_date: 2015-03-24 08:21:00

The higher the price goes the more value is produced per day by monetary base inflation via mining. So in a sense it's self limiting that way. At least for many years. 
'Legitimate' demand could increase a lot and the price could not follow if the speculative demand subsides. But if both forms outstrip supply then we could see some price appreciation. But it's certainly not guaranteed. There's a lot of different scenarios out there.

Have you tried Electrum? It's not an online wallet but it's pretty good and easy to use. You write down your twelve word key and you'll always be able to restore your wallet from that key on any computer. So you don't have to worry if your hard drive fails or whatever.

Honestly, I'm a fan of Bitcoin but for the most part this seems to be very true. Doesn't mean Bitcoin is going to die or anything, but Bitcoin definitely attracts some fringe people who seem to arrogantly think they have it all figured out.
@_date: 2015-02-13 10:09:13


People don't have to be paid to get a bad impression of Bitcoin you know.
@_date: 2015-02-28 14:45:02
Isn't the advantage of making a local currency is that you have control over it? Like you use it as a representation of labour of the people who live there and use it.
Not sure I see the benefit of backing a currency with Bitcoin in this situation. The volatility is a pretty big negative for lower income people and could do more harm than good. Backing it with fiat or gold at this point is probably a better option to be honest. Bitcoin is great, but it still has a long way to go.
@_date: 2015-02-28 08:51:12


If this is true then I don't think Bitcoin has much of a future.
But I don't necessarily think that's the only thing that matters.

This is a thing? Publicly accessible rooms?
@_date: 2015-02-08 08:55:38


No, this is a big issue. In the long run it actually doesn't make sense that a decentralized system with its inherent added cost would be able to out complete efficient centralized finance in these sorts of markets. In the short term it might be possible with a sufficiently liquid Bitcoin market and Bitcoin companies being able to avoid being regulated. But I can't imagine Bitcoin companies getting a permanent pass on regulation.
@_date: 2015-02-06 11:30:48
Because they would probably have to have a team of 5 people full time printing out new BTC denominated price tags every few minutes.

Using this with Bitcoin should be good as an alternative to sidechains for now. Will be interested to see how this cross-chain stuff fairs against actual pegged sidechains. UI and user experience will be pretty important for people and as of now I have no idea what the UI/UX looks like for using Bitcoin with sidechained cryptos. I guess I'd expect that you would be able to use sidechains with this too since you're already using Bitcoin with it and the two things aren't mutually exclusive as far as I can tell.

They might in the future if the choice is between shutting down operations because the reward makes mining no longer profitable. If it comes down to that it might be the only option for them.
edit: also lowering the difficulty enables the miners to attack that chain, instamine it and drive the difficulty back up.

I'm not saying people should use it as a wallet, or store all of their money on there. But using them to take advantage of a service like Tether or something seems reasonable to me unless there's been red flags recently that I'm not aware of.

They got $30 million from investors. As we all know this is a bullshit statistic. I wonder if they used this wallet metric as a selling point attempting to give the impression that the wallet amount correlated with actual customers.

Canada and many countries in Asia have instant p2p interbank transfers too. Free in some cases too.
Europe has SEPA too which is pretty quick.
@_date: 2015-02-28 14:48:16
I agree that using Bitcoin for something like this is likely to do more harm than good.
Maybe in 5-10 years perhaps.
@_date: 2015-02-18 16:59:03
Funny that he decides to do this after SuperNET had already done this and posted it on Github months ago. And named it MegaNET as well. I wonder if it will be open source as well. Also wonder if it uses DHT and UDP too. I assume if it was a fork he would have said something though.
He might have been unaware of projects that offer something similar though. It's going to be nice to send transactions through something other than Tor either way. He seems to want to recreate the internet though so MegaNET probably won't be focused on using Bitcoin et al anonymously like SuperNET will be.
@_date: 2015-02-11 08:37:20


Not really. Bitcoin was marketed to people as anonymous for a long time. Now most people know better than to call it anonymous though, but still, many people initially learned of Bitcoin as that 'anonymous' cryptocurrency.
It's similar to how Bitcoin is still marketed as a deflationary currency, when in reality it's not inherently deflationary in any reasonable time frame.
And then there's 'trustless', except the part where you have to trust a handful of mining pools. Not that any of this makes Bitcoin any less amazing really, but I've found the rhetoric around Bitcoin to be misleading at best over the years.
@_date: 2015-02-20 07:25:24


Amazingly invasive. :P
@_date: 2015-02-24 16:13:42

Wasn't a very good idea in the first place from my impression of it anyway. Probably much better uses for that money to help increase Bitcoin education and adoption.

I really wish this could have been the case, but the hypocritical murder for hire stuff makes it all a waste.


I'm pretty sure that the government would have offered no such deal. They knew they had him 100%. Dratel even said something the lines of 'they offered nothing of significance'.

I think his vision of server farms of miners were still just individuals. I don't think he ever expected pools like Slush invented with massive mounts of individual miners pooling their hashing.
@_date: 2015-02-17 15:29:10
He presumably researches this stuff for fun. He spent a huge amount of time tracking Satoshi's coins and modeling his mining pattern. Also he continues to build his reputation as a Bitcoin expert which has probably lead to some professional opportunities for him.
Also 5% at scale is pretty big I think.

@_date: 2015-02-25 12:21:55


Yeah, this was a myth that for perpetuated a lot by the media and such. But it's not true at all. Everyone can log on to a site like blockchain.info and see everyone's transactions and how much they have in their wallet.
@_date: 2015-02-16 17:02:37
And if users of the sidechain decide that the two way peg to BTC is holding them back what's to stop them from forking away from being a sidechain?
I'm guessing the answer is 'nothing, but there's no reason for them to do that.', but we will see. In the long run if there's a technology that people are using and is clearly superior to Bitcoin I could definitely see people questioning why their economic fate should be linked with the older inferior tech.
@_date: 2015-02-05 13:57:48


This is pretty true in my experience. Much easier to just copy what already exists than redo all of your own legislation. Plus if things don't work out you can shift some of the blame.

It is. ;)
@_date: 2015-03-02 11:46:39
Yeah, this makes a lot of sense imo. One of the big advantages of cryptocurrency is how easy it is to pivot or shift the network effect over to something else. There's no physical barriers, only minor digital ones.
@_date: 2015-03-17 18:14:32
Well at least with IBM they have name recognition and a long history. If my fridge is going to be running some sort of 'Internet of Things' crypto that orders me food when I need it I'd trust IBM before I'd trust some random person or group.
They could build it on BTC but I assume they would rather have more control over the financial aspects. 
Maybe there will be a competing system that uses BTC and makes it trustless so it won't matter if it's a person in their basement forking it and releasing it. Then I can just use that and it will be interesting to see how that all plays out if something like that actually happened.

I agree that this is probably the most likely positive scenario for Bitcoin. Even if other digital currency technologies become widely adopted Bitcoin might be regarded as a sort of digital gold for a long time.

@_date: 2015-02-16 15:43:46


There's lots of smart people working on real innovative technology you know. This is a pretty ridiculous statement. 


You realize sidechains will be alts right? And there's still a lot of uncertainty on just how the economic incentives will allign. Also, as far as I know there's nothing stopping a sidechain from forking off and deciding that they'd be better off not being held back and pegged to BTC.
And I don't know of any successful implementations of Coinjoin with BTC yet. The last one I heard of was bc.i's which turned out to be laughably bad and people were tracing the coins just by eyeballing them. It doesn't come close to some of the anon tech that's being developed in the alt space.
Are you an early adopter of BTC who has a five figure amount of BTC or something? Or someone heavily invested in mining? If so then I understand your viewpoint and why you feel it necessary to protect your investment this way. 
@_date: 2015-03-16 17:16:45
Not beyond a shadow of a doubt, but given the evidence it would point to Ross with a high probability imo. Definitely enough that I wouldn't choose him as someone who I felt represented my beliefs. 
I think sympathetic people should at the most stay neutral to him and not use him as a poster-child for non-violent voluntary interaction. And certainly not praise him as a hero. 
@_date: 2015-02-01 11:22:51


The cycle yeah, not necessarily growth though. 
The big danger is if too many drop out while the difficulty is high and the network slows to a crawl.
@_date: 2015-02-16 08:48:07
Any evidence of that?
@_date: 2015-02-04 20:23:14
Does anyone here still actually support Ross?
I think this whole thing would have been a lot more interesting if he wasn't one of the worst hypocrites I've ever seen. For someone who was supposed to base his belief system on voluntary non violent interactions between people, he didn't seem to have much trouble taking out hits on five people. 
What's scary is there had seemed to be a fair amount of people here who either supported him despite the murders, or were crazy enough to think that he didn't actually order them somehow.
@_date: 2015-03-18 13:15:13
I don't know, if someone can design a system that provides anonymity at both the network level and blockchain level(cryptographically) then it seems possible to me. 
I think people are trying to put all the pieces together now to create such a system but there's nothing ready yet. Maybe sometime this year if we're lucky.
@_date: 2015-02-01 09:50:11
What about the fact that the mined block has to be relayed by the miner(I think?) and it broadcasts that IP. I mean you could use a VPN or whatever, but that's still doesn't really qualify as anonymous.

All they would have to do to secure it is make it PoS and stake with &gt; 50% of the currency.
Not that there's much point to them doing this as fiat is a much better alternative for a nation state.

Yeah, I'm constantly surprised to hear that the US doesn't have things like instant interbank p2p transfers and such. The US is kind of a weird place, very polarized. Some things are way ahead of the curve and other things are just oddly behind. I don't know what it is, maybe some sort of "we'll do it ourselves, our way" mentality or something? Or lack of an open competitive market like the cable/internet industry there?
@_date: 2015-02-08 17:29:17
Not too surprising considering that most peoples impression of Bitcoin there is probably based off of Mt.Gox and euphoric Karpeles.

Eh, there's actually quite a few new technologies out there beside NXT and Ripple. NXT and Ripple are probably the oldest and most mature though.
I just had a quick look at the coinmarket cap top 30 and the majority of them excluding Bitcoin are based on new technology.
I only mention this because it's so common to see people slag off alts here in as shitcoins and clones, when in reality there's actually lots of new work and innovation going on. Not saying you in particular are saying this, but in general the attitude here is really bad.

bitUSD and Nubits being new technologies, I can understand being skeptical a bit for the short term. But Tether is Bitfinex isn't it? You don't trust Bitfinex enough to use them at all? If you don't trust them, who do you trust for dealing with USD?

This is kind of bittersweet though as while it definitely helps increase the value of everyone else's BTC, it's horrible from a marketing perspective and turns some people off.

I love Bitcoin but I'm not expecting it to win any long term market share in remittances since it would have to be extremely liquid on an international level. Companies facilitating remittances with Bitcoin will unlikely be permanently immune from regulation as well. I think Bitcoin remittance companies can maybe out compete WU in a few markets in the short term, but that market will continue to mature as will the international banking system.
It's not easier than credit cards and it doesn't offer any of the many benefits that credit cards do to consumers. I don't think it's competitive in the consumer payments area.
Store of value, sure. It could easily become an asset similar to gold and silver. And if Wall St. decides it's a fun toy to speculate with then that might just be the first step towards that.

The trust issue is similar to how you must trust miners and mining pools I think. I don't really see a fundamental difference in that regard.
Checkpointing can become part of the protocol and be done in an automated fashion. I think NXT is set up so that it checkpoints itself every 720 or 1440 blocks. I'm no expert on NXT though so I could be wrong. Also, doesn't Bitcoin use some form of checkpointing anyway?

I'm not "pumping" anything. Miners are a necessary evil thus far and hypothetically if we could fork to something that achieves a similar amount of security and stops inflation, why would anyone not want that? The actual computing power and bandwidth it takes to run the network is nothing compared to the amount burned on mining.
@_date: 2015-02-16 07:58:12
That's not true at all.
@_date: 2015-02-15 18:02:27
From one view point Bitcoin is wasteful assuming there's a more efficient way to achieve a similar result.
From another view point someone might see Bitcoin as wasteful simply because the billions of dollars poured in to it through mining simply don't offer a comparable amount of value. Completely subjective of course, and for some what Bitcoin offers is of the highest value to them.
Then there might be people who have a problem with the environmental damage that is caused by Bitcoin. But in that case they must be quite angry with many different things.
@_date: 2015-02-13 21:22:51
This is why Bitcoin is self limiting I think. But I never see people bring that fact up when making these wild predictions. And when it does get brought up the counter is that Bitcoin's inflation will be close to zero on some far off date that doesn't really help anyone thinking that Bitcoin has a chance to go parabolic for real any time soon.

When the peg is created, and say I sequester 1 BTC to say 10 xcoin, where are these xcoins coming from? Does the act of putting the 1 BTC in the two-way peg cause the sidechain to mint 10 new xcoins? If the peg is at 10:1, does that mean in this example there could only ever be 210 million xcoins ever to exist(and this would only happen if every single Bitcoin was sequestered)? What about people mining the xcoin chain? I understand that they can merge mine with Bitcoin, but where would the reward come from for mining xcoin? Transaction fees?

Right. You would buy the TV with BitPay at the store.
BitInstant provides a service which is supposed to offer a way to purchase bitcoins quickly through a variety of methods. I doubt their target market is people looking to purchase large amounts of bitcoin. Exchanges are always going to be able to provide cheaper rates for that segment of the market.
People who want their bitcoin asap, can use BitInstant. They pay a higher fee because they have a time preference for their purchase. I'm pretty sure this is exactly the market that BitInstant is targeting.

@_date: 2013-04-07 13:07:58
The amount of transactions that will be included per block relative to the amount that would be needed if Bitcoin was widely used as currency.
Imagine having 10, or 100 times the volume that Satoshidice alone creates.
I guess mining pools could come up with some sort of agreement or union that limits transaction fees if they felt that the benefit to Bitcoin in the long run outweighed their short term loss of fees. That might be interesting.
Because I think people will be using Bitcoin for many important transfers that will be willing to pay a significant fee, common small transactions which cannot or will not compete with those fees will be not be prioritized and thus not processed in a timely manner at some point eventually.
@_date: 2015-02-23 16:17:28


The cost of operating isn't necessarily paid by the consumer at all though. When choosing a price you would assume that a business would be acting rationally by attempting to maximize their profit. The cost of operating is going to be paid by the business. Either offering credit cards adds value and profit to their business or it doesn't, in which case they wouldn't use them. The fees are coming out of the merchants profit margin. To say that they would raise their prices to offset that fee means that you're implying that they could have raised there prices before then as well and made more money. The addition of credit card fees doesn't change anything.
The credit card provider and the merchant are both going to charge as much as the market can bear to maximize their profit. It doesn't logically follow that the fees of value added service meant to increase sales necessarily causes the fee to be passed on to the consumer by raised prices. The cost is paid by the merchant unless they specifically add a service charge to people paying with a credit card. Which isn't allowed in almost all cases.
Think of it this way: if you were running a store that started to accept credit cards and decided to raise all your prices by a dollar to offset that cost, why didn't you raise your prices before if raising prices like that will generate more profit? Passing them on to consumer implies that they were leaving money on the table the whole time. And if someone has this mind set then they're doing it wrong.
Merchants are fine with paying a credit card fee because the ability to accept credit cards generates more revenue and more profit. Else they wouldn't offer them. Saying something like that the cost of operating is passed on to the consumers like it's a fact is wrong. There's a wide range of possibilities in this case including ones where increased sales could allow a merchant to offer lower prices due to volume. Profit in some cases could be increased by lowering prices to stay more competitive resulting in higher sales and higher profit even with a lowered margin.

This has been so overblown in the Bitcoin community and used to completely dismiss probably the single most important innovation in cryptocurrency since Bitcoin itself.
And the delegation stuff doesn't sound centralised to me at all considering it's 101 different delegates and no single centralised price feed. And I don't think the developers fix any kinds of votes. It was a suggestion that was dismissed as far as I know. But I'm not involved in Bitshares at all and am far from an expert on their system.

No, the possible 10k is just the forum donations. 
There was a thread recently on bitcointalk where someone was trying to figure out how many coins Satoshi had, and theymos mentioned that he was mining blocks back during the very early days of bitcoin. 
This was before people were even ordering pizza for 10k coins. So if theymos held a large number of coins it would not surprise me at all. But lots of people have been around bitcoin for a long period of time and have not managed to hold on to a large amount of coins for one reason or another. So if he now had only a modest amount of coins I wouldn't be shocked.

Again, not necessarily. That assumes they're not maximizing their profit not begin with. In some places where there is no law against it, some merchants will add a surcharge for people using credit cards, and in that case they're passing it on. But that's against the law in many places and in most cases the merchant just eats the fee because they actually gain more profit by offering credit cards as a payment option.
It's like when HSBC got fined a large amount for money laundering, say it was a billion dollars or something. You might think that that fine is going to be passed on to consumers via higher fees, but assuming that implies that they're not acting rationally and maximizing their profit already. The fine will eat in to their profit margin for sure. But losses like that don't suddenly make the business wake up and say, hey we actually could have been charging more this whole time, lets do that now so we can offset our recent loss.

I agree with you for the most part. But in a free market I think it's important that people disseminate the information so that others can be aware of the reality of the situation.

The difference here is that Josh will refund whether you want it or not. And when you do not want a refund and have one forced upon you, it's more akin to breaking a contract than it is to making a sale.
And it's worse for Garr seeing as how he has a business that is relying on receiving that asic. So breaking that contract would damage him significantly. 
I'm not a lawyer, so I don't know whether or not that would be considered breach of contract by law or not. But in my view it is extremely poor business practice.

Sure. Garr was acting immature. And was busted with an alt account.
But, going to cancel his order? That's pretty ridiculous.

I think the bitcoin economy is quite a bit higher than 50 million.
I would say it's over 100 million considering bitpay alone is reporting 5 million dollar months. And then there is silk road and everything else.

That would be cool. Is there some sort of MOTD that can be broadcasted across the pool or something?
We've already seen pool operators step up and make some massive fee refunds. How cool would it be if, like you said, a decentralized system could as well.

Just wondering. I don't know anything other than he contributes to the kernel as well as bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-05-02 14:05:58
I don't know if you could really call it morally equivalent to theft, since the act of "investing" as a third party without control in a ponzi doesn't meet any classical definition of theft.
But you could make an argument as to it's morality, sure. Theft is a little strong though I think.

+1 for asicminer.
Avalon is trustworthy, but having some distribution problems. Nothing near as bad as BFL though. BFL is an absolute mess.

Haha. I laughed when I saw that one too.
@_date: 2013-04-20 14:47:23
BFL is the shitstain on the bitcoin flag.

Which ASICMiner is as well now, fyi.
@_date: 2013-06-19 19:23:00
If you put the money in to ASICMiner that you were intending to use to pre-order the minirig, that is a huge win for you. Great call there.

Well, it's an interesting question in general. Code can be forked, and people can decide to use other exchanges.
But if theymos was evil, the damage he could do is large. And it's the type of damage where you wouldn't even know who or what was behind it. So maybe he is the most powerful. Gox has a really strong argument though for sure.
Of course, theymos is not evil, and his interests are obviously aligned with bitcoin.

@_date: 2013-04-02 19:16:25
He was pretty in to bitcoin in general. I think he has faith in bitcoin. If anything, it's more likely he kept most of it since cashing all of that out under his own name with the AML laws and the SEC involved might have been tricky.

The topic of this post is about people speculating that the large sell off is an attempt to manipulate the market and cause a cascade of people selling to drive the price down.
Obviously the intent of that strategy is to buy back in at lower than originally sold for.

I think the design for the most part is alright. I've read a lot of forums the years and bitcointalk has a decent amount of features and is easy to read without being obnoxious like other forums.
The one thing I really would like is the ability for people to be able to build optional apps and enhancements on top of the forum. That way we can leverage all of the great ideas and programmers involved in bitcoin while still retaining the core functionality of the forum.
