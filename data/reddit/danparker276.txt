The problem is I'm not sure many of the workers will want to set up a bitcoin wallet
If they had a coinbase in all countries that would be easy to use coinbase.  Coinbase is only in US and now UK right?
@_date: 2015-06-16 22:01:07
Yeah, this might work
@_date: 2015-06-01 21:46:11
There's always a way, maybe they could use a company like coinbase for all accounts so it doesn't go through the blockchain.  
@_date: 2015-06-01 21:49:37
I guess to would reflect on Nambia's fate, but it's still supply and demand.  Maybe more people around the world would also invest/trade in bitcoin if they saw a small country using it

Streamium is flawed because it's p2p.  Many firewalls won't let that through.  Plus if you get too many p2p connections at one time, forget about it.  Going through a service like tokbox will route the webrtc so it's not p2p, but that costs money.  Streamium will probably come up with a paid model as well
@_date: 2015-05-23 06:27:19
Accepting is a lot different than making it the official currency and paying your workers and collecting taxes in bitcoin.  I think there are even some states that are trying to except bitcoin (instant exchange though).
But basically a rich country still gains from printing their own money.  I don't think they'd risk giving that up (would be nice if they did).  Plus their economy might be too large

yes, that's why it has to be a failed nation that has nothing to lose.  The amount of money the failed nation could make off this deal would more than make up for giving up control of it's money supply that no one is using anyway.
@_date: 2015-05-24 16:54:44
webrtc only supports desktop sharing with a chrome or firefox extension you have to build.  This free webRTC streaming is a myth for real production use.  WebRTC is great but it will fail too often with non tech people so it's best to have a provider like tokbox and they'll charge you money for their routed connection

Gold is over valued.  It can be used as a metal, in computer chips...
Imagine if wearing gold were found to cause some skin disease, or if India stopped using gold as wedding gifts.  The value could drop a ton.  Or if they harvest gold from astroids, other parts of space, or find a cheap way to use an atom smasher and make more gold here.
@_date: 2015-05-29 02:02:17
India buys a lot of gold jewelry wise and imports a lot of gold.  If people stopped using it as jewelry the price would plummet.

webRTC won't work in Safari ever because of Apple.  If you're willing to build a plug-in for it it might be posssible.  The new Microsoft browser Edge is supposed to support it, it might not on release though.  IE won't.  Only chrome and firefox.
@_date: 2015-05-23 20:52:46
Yes, I'm not saying these people are going to do it out of the kindness of their heart.  There has to be more money to be made by the ruling party of the failed nation.
1.  They don't get the $100 Million from country R.
2.  The GDP of some of these small nations can be $100mil.  Now if Bitcoin goes up 100-1000x because of this, you're going to make an investment way more than any amount of money you can print.   A small nation can print money, but most people in that country use other currency or cellphone minutes.  These kleptocrats will never be able to profit as much.

Apple has their facetime and are for sure not going to support webrtc in the next few years at least.  I think there is an open source plugin possibly, but I think you have to compile it for your site and it probably doesn't work well.  Mobile ios chrome it won't work either, android chrome it will though.  P2P webRTC without going through a paid routing provider is an iffy connection anyway

Well eventually (I think they already do) have a credit card based on bitcoins, they pay the merchant in bitcoins and you pay your bill in bitcoins.  It's just a loan anyway.  The american financial system is based on credit, this is never going away.

Yes, that is something I would put on my site.  And I would rather buy from a merchant like that.  
Maybe I'll put a disclaimer or something at the bottom of the site saying, "We Accept Bitcoin and do not convert back into USD" or something
@_date: 2015-05-25 04:06:42
Well you can make an educated guess based on what Apple is trying to push.  iOS has a chrome browser, but Apple blocks it on iOS because they want people to use facetime.  It's also an opinion based on many reading many articles and to support webRTC in 3 years, they would have have already started development on it and we would have heard something

Market cap is a all time high, that is better than the price.
@_date: 2016-12-24 17:26:59
For me it's better because the larger the market cap, the less it can be manipulated by the un-regulated market.
The ultimate goal of bitcoin is to get a percentage of the total money supply in the world.  This is measured by market cap.  I'd hope it will get to 5-15% in the next 20 years.
@_date: 2016-12-17 23:28:08
Move it to the coinbase wallet vault,  so you can't accidently transfer it out if you're using it as an investment. It will take 7days to transfer out.  
 
If you have to ask that question,  I wouldnt move it to another exchange where you have a private key or have to keep track of them.   Unless you like writing down keys on a piece of paper and putting it in a safety deposit box. 
If your goal is to try spending bitcoin at a store,  coinbase is fine,  you'll soon realize it's easier to use a credit card or phone pay. Unless you're being paid in bitcoin,  its not worth the fees moving from your bank to bitcoin. Until stores start offering a  10% discount,  there is no use,  unless you live in a county with super high inflation 
@_date: 2016-12-23 16:43:35
Basically it $900 (current price) multiplied by how many bitcoins there are available.  That gives the market cap.
Just like the stock market, if 1 company's stock may have a price a lot lower than company B, they they have many more shares outstanding, so the total value of the company is more.
Here's a good site that shows the marketcap of each coin:
@_date: 2016-12-17 23:30:33
Yep,  I'm far more likely to lose my keys.  Also the way coinbase does it is very secure with cold storage.   If coinbase got hacked and people lost their money,  I don't think bitcoin would survive much after that anyway. 
@_date: 2016-12-18 04:01:36
Yes, that's the other way of looking at things and a valid point.  But looking at the length coinbase went to secure their keys, I don't there is a more trustable online storage.  Also with their investors and team, there's isn't a more trust-able organization. 
 
If they can't secure their keys and lose everyone's money, I don't think anyone would ever trust an online wallet again.  And bitcoin isn't going to succeed without online wallets.  Mt. Gox lost people's money but it's easy to see why that happened.
They could fail like AOL and lose business, but you'd still have your money.
@_date: 2019-04-03 04:13:51
Also, they have a vault in case I try to mis-spend or someone tries to take it out. Also it's easier to do beneficiaries.
@_date: 2019-04-03 04:11:56
Nope, their hot wallet is insured by Lloyds of London they said
@_date: 2019-04-03 04:11:04
They just had a great blog post about their insurance, it's only on their hot wallet, which is more expensive to insure.
@_date: 2019-04-03 16:21:00
Here's a link about their insurance published April 2. They also talk about how insurance companies need to hold BTC and how they are educating them. It may not be perfect now, but they're working on it
@_date: 2019-04-15 16:13:19
In addition to IE, they're on .aspx pages, I suppose better than .asp but. Well I suppose it's ok. The domain goes to:  
 [ 
They were maybe contracted by bofa to do this if legit. I'd expect if bofa took it online, it would be more cleaned up like their site.
They're doing the demo for them I guess. Probably C# on aspx will work better on IE 11.
If they did do crypto, it would be a lot easier for users to do this than, go to coinbase and buy bitcoin, plus Bofa could get all the transaction fees. Makes sense for them to do it, they just care about making money.

Less daily supply. In the end it's all about supply and demand. It's all about accumulation now for the next 5+ years. 21 Mil BTC total, probably only 15 or 16 not lost or dependable vs 70 million millionaires. The longer it stays above 0 the more and more trust it has as a store of value
@_date: 2018-11-18 22:49:12
My bad, still more than the number of bitcoin though. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 00:56:18
I used to think that way as well, but that large amount is traded every day, yet the price doesn't really move much. I think it'd deceptive somehow, but I can't explain it well. I think I'd also want a better explanation 
@_date: 2018-11-18 22:52:48
I'm really not into TA, I look at the big picture more. Do I want to have bitcoin long term, USD or other assets. 
@_date: 2018-11-18 23:54:14
Oh, yeah I thought about that as well. $4 bil a day vs 5m supply isn't much, but someone has to be accumulating them. I suppose that $4 bil is going back and forth between the same people. So I think the 4 $bil is a bit deceiving.

My wife says that the whole family doesn't like Caitlyn now, it might not be a bash against transgendered people, but just his personality now vs before. If this isn't a hack, it's been up for 7+ hours now.
@_date: 2017-10-12 03:36:36
I've just never used one, I don't understand why you'd write down 12 words instead of your private key. I suppose if you want to trade frequently and hold a little money in there it's ok, but if you want to hold, a paper wallet is probably better.  In the end, you're going to have to put that 12 word pass phrase in a safety deposit box or I suppose you could put it on you computer somewhere (I wouldn't store it on my computer though).
And a paper wallet in a safety deposit box would probably be better if you have beneficiaries 
@_date: 2017-10-17 20:32:47
If this is really a hack, maybe they'll dedicate a show to this anyway, and the Kardashians will end up take sides on the bizcoin fork.
@_date: 2017-10-12 04:11:20
Now this is a really good post.
I mentioned earlier I did get the frequent use, although I'd have a different account for frequent use vs holding. Then I'd just save somewhere on my computer and cut and paste. I do see the advantage if you memorize it... I'd rather have it as a low amount of money on my phone though with an app or exchange. I can see the advantage there though.  Not an interest for me at this point.
And yes, it's better than running a node to create the key, I suppose getting a private key through a website is technically not secure because the website could save it before sending it
How do you get those  flood-and-fire proof copper and brass plates. Do you make those your self?
I'd forget the code myself without writing it down and would have to put it in a safety deposit box.  That's the hesitation I face of getting one.
@_date: 2018-02-26 19:08:13
It would be at the time of the theft, I'm not sure when that was, but probably isn't worth as much.

NXT coin basically has the same thing, it's just a converted pass phrase. Really there's no difference between 12 words and writing down your public and private key then.

I think the  real question you're asking is if China is messing with the price,  or is it really going up for legit reasons
@_date: 2015-11-05 06:29:23
Why I don't understand why a big tech company doesn't buy a giant share of bitcoin and use it as their currency.
@_date: 2017-05-22 18:03:35
That's one of the parts I don't understand, the transaction volume.   Is it useful transaction volume as in real monetary transactions (personA to personB) or buying goods.
@_date: 2015-11-04 22:33:32
Close to 500, down to 415 is a stop to the rise.  Well haven't checked in 30 min or so.
@_date: 2016-05-06 17:14:06
They could have a 3rd party to give out the notes.  That would eliminate the corruption, but now there has to be an incentive for the corrupt politicians.  That incentive would be insider knowledge that the price of bitcoin is going to spike on the news.  Say they back up 200million with government money and let coinbase hold it.  They can make 100x on their own personal bitcoin wallets before the government starts to buy bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-11-04 22:35:07
If you don't know why you shouldn't be trying to day trade bitcoin.  (Not that I know)
@_date: 2017-05-22 17:01:03
Yeah, I read that before, but for ETH I thought maybe it's a little different, it's traded on things like coinbase.  Do you think people are just hoarding ETH
@_date: 2016-05-06 19:29:05
Yes, that is their sacrifice.  Considering no one will trust their money anyway, it's not a big deal.  I think they would gain far more money from the spike in bitcoin than they ever could by printing a few extra dollars.
Long term it would also make their citizens more wealthy and possibly boost their economy creating more revenue to be taxed. 
@_date: 2016-05-06 19:06:04
For most people they'd probably use their phone like cell phone minute trading.  Eventually you'd want to get rid of paper money.  And like said in the thread above, have a 3rd party print it, local government wouldn't be able to print more.  If it gets worn out, trade it in.
@_date: 2016-05-06 16:41:10
You could maybe do it by putting a public key printed on each note.  But then you could duplicate keys on notes.
You could always people to turn in paper money and exchange for bitcoin at any time.  But you're questioning how legit the exchange will be.  Maybe get a big company like coinbase involved.  eventually try to take people off paper money and pay all government employees in digital wallets
@_date: 2016-05-10 00:38:02
Any US president will have little impact on bitcoin.  If/when bitcoin takes off, it will most likely be because a 3rd world country is using it.
@_date: 2016-05-06 14:52:31
If they were smart they would back it with bitcoin instead. Besides all the benefits bitcoin would bring to the banking system, making it the countries currency would probably make the price x100. That'd give them 20 billion. Well if they won't do it, some other country will eventually.
@_date: 2016-05-06 19:09:53
"inept government to inspire confidence in a currency"
Yes, you have to give them a reason to give up the corruption and double printing money.  The only way to do that is to offer them more money (or a more corrupt way).  That is provided by giving them insider information about the spike in the price of bitcoin which they can purchase on their own free will, and there is no penalty because it's unregulated.  This way they get more money with and they're not doing anything wrong. Win-Win
@_date: 2016-05-06 19:32:43

Coinbase has incentive to make this a business for other countries.  It would be their hard currency.  It would probably be in their best interest long term not to double print.
@_date: 2017-07-23 21:36:34
I suppose it depends what country you're in, but if you sell and convert to fiat, you then have to pay 20-40% tax, so if you plan to buy back again, it's a terrible gamble.

yeah, I'm glad coinbase won't support this.
@_date: 2016-05-06 20:32:49
Well that's part of the challenge.  I think that an international company like coinbase could do it.  They don't want to destroy their reputation.

@_date: 2016-05-06 19:26:02
It's a win-win.  They government officials would use and pay employees in bitcoin.  They lose the ability to over print their money supply, but they'd gain 10x to 100x on their person investment from the spike in bitcoin price.
@_date: 2016-07-06 05:50:07
Who cares, you're an idiot if you are in this for comparative yield by year.  This is a unregulated market being manipulated.  As long as people keep using it and it's not compromised it's has value that can't be measured like other assets.  This is an all or nothing investment.
