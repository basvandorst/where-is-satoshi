Your writing parses better than OP's, but I disagree with the points you made.


Well that is definitely wrong.  Storage capacity has grown exponentially throughout history.  The bitcoin blockchain grows faster than logarithmic, it grows linearly.  Logarithmic growth is so small that we could keep up with it even if storage capacity stopped increasing.


Logarithmic storage growth would not be sufficient to keep up with the bitcoin blockchain, because it grows linearly.  However, it's a non-issue because storage grows exponentially (or at least, it has up until present day).

That's not right.  You can get paid in an LN channel and then spend that money later, all without closing the channel state.  They're called bi-directional payment channels.  For example, the employees could go spend their money at a shopping all, and when they pay a merchant, their first routing hop would be via mcdonald's, and then go further out into the LN and finally reach the merchant they are paying.

There is no global limit for the network as a whole, since it's just a bunch of peer-to-peer connections, just like the internet.  Each hop is limited by the throughput of the peers on both ends, which will be based on their bandwidth, latency, and ability to create/validate transactions and update their channel state.

It will work for closed loop cases where you're earning and spending within LN.  For cashing out, you could actually send an LN transaction to an exchange to buy fiat, and the exchange can trust that payment without needing to close out the channel.

Anyone know how the transaction produced the collision based on the PDFs?
I tried diffing the two PDF's and can see that they are identical except for a 128 byte block.  Then I searched the transaction that claimed the bounty and found that it used these 128 byte blocks (represented below in hex):
shattered-1.pdf contains 7346dc9166b67e118f029ab621b2560ff9ca67cca8c7f85ba84c79030c2b3de218f86db3a90901d5df45c14f26fedfb3dc38e96ac22fe7bd728f0e45bce046d23c570feb141398bb552ef5a0a82be331fea48037b8b5d71f0e332edf93ac3500eb4ddc0decc1a864790c782c76215660dd309791d06bd0af3f98cda4bc4629b1

However, I noticed that the SHA1 hash of the 2 blocks is different.  Unless I'm mistaken it's:
block1 hash = 196944f67c863ba0f9c7530f7eef1df05b391c5c
block2 hash = ff19d8aeed375c5e4739c2d3c1028054bb2adb15
I'm not sure how to produce a collision from those blocks - do you need to add additional padding somewhere?  It would help if I had a tool to decode the scriptsig to see exactly what values they put on the stack.
@_date: 2017-02-26 07:20:12
You will validate blocks faster when you have a mempool because transactions in the mempool have already been validated, so you don't need to recheck the signatures when you see them in a block.  Blocksonly mode will give slower validation of blocks but you'll save on memory and bandwidth.

@_date: 2017-02-12 10:53:06
I did some googling to find a good writeup, and am surprised to see there's not really any good document that captures it all.  My understanding of the latency issue comes from reading the bitcoin dev mailing list and also reddit comments and IRC discussions.
Basically, as a miner, your orphan rate is proportional to the time it takes your block to reach other miners.  So in a simplified example, if your block takes 10 seconds to reach other people and be validated, then during that 10 seconds there's a possibility that someone else's block is being broadcast and beats you.  Since bitcoin mining is a poisson process, the odds of getting orphaned would be 10/600 = ~1.66%.  That means every time you mine a block, there's a 1.66% chance it will get orphaned and you'll earn nothing.  If broadcast latency is proportional to block size (as it would be without things like compact blocks), doubling the block size would double the orphan rate.
You may wonder, why is this a problem, if all miners should suffer the same orphan rate, their profitability should be equal?  The problem is, your real orphan rate is orphan_rate * percentage_of_competing_hash_rate.  So if your pool had 10% of network hash rate, your actual orphan rate would be 1.66% * 90% = 1.49%.  Why? Because 10% of the time you will mine the next block, thus orphaning the other block that beat you.  So what this means is that larger pools end up having greater profitability that smaller pools, which creates a drive to centralise pools as the larger ones can out-compete the smaller ones.
Since this orphaning advantage is proportional to broadcast latency, we have to keep latency low to allow small pools to still be competitive.

So, what are you findings?
@_date: 2017-02-23 00:04:17
Think of it as if your wallet master key was actually Hash(24-word-seed + passphrase).
So if you only have the seed, there's actually an infinite number of possible wallets depending on the passphrase you enter.
If someone only has the seed (or trezor+pin), they won't be able to derive your key.

How much swap space do you have?
@_date: 2017-02-08 21:39:20
Total chain size only effects initial sync time.  It's not such a critical issue.
Block size effects broadcast latency for miners, which effects mining centralisation and is the central issue of the block size debate.

People started calling it when they saw BU blocks dropping and segwit blocks increasing.  They thought this meant hash power had defected from ant pool.  People prematurely started celebrating based on the 144 block count which is highly subject to variance.

Yes but the total earnings for miners is &lt;number-of-transactions&gt; * &lt;average-fee-per-transaciton&gt;.
So inceasing the average fee is only one part of the equation.  There will be some choice of parameters that maximises this earnings equation, and it's very unlikely that it happens to be at exactly 1MB blocks.  The sweet spot would also constantly be changing as demand changes.

Users always have the power to modify their clients to follow whatever rules they want.  Anyone can unilaterally activate segwit on their node and fork themself from the network.  UASF is just a co-ordination between many users to all do this at the same time.  Miners can still choose whether to mine the soft fork or not.
The way I see it, there are two outcomes:
- If the UASF gets &lt;50% miner support, then there becomes two chains, a minority UASF chain, and a majority non-UASF chain.
- If the UASF gets &gt;50% miner support, then the whole network follows the soft fork (there is no choice since the UASF chain will also be valid to non-UASF nodes).
@_date: 2017-03-30 01:59:16
UASF can force a chain split which defeats the purpose of a soft fork, which is to prevent a split.
1 CPU = 1 vote refers to building consensus on the ordering of transactions through proof-of-work.  That's unrelated to soft/hard forks.  There is no voting mechanism required for deciding consensus rules - you can fork any time with whoever wants to join you.  I just won't be following it until the segwit chain actually becomes longer, which may never happen.

You are thinking of payment channels. 
 There is a difference between payment channels and lightning network.
Payment channels enable rapid transactions between two parties.  Lightning network is a *network* of payment channels that are linked, so you can route payments over multiple channels to reach the destination.  You don't need to have a direct channel with someone in LN to transact with them.
@_date: 2017-03-30 02:26:05
Of course you can implement whatever rules you want.  You don't need a whitepaper to tell you that, just a C++ compiler.  My point is that you're deliberately forking the network in a contentious way, which is equivilent to what BU are doing.

I think "economic majority" is kind of meaningless.  Every user is free to make their choice of which chain to follow.  There will be network effects that mean that a large number of users might converge on one chain, but that's up to each user to decide for themself which version of bitcoin they want.  No one has their protocol rules dictated to them by miners, or by any economic powers.
What miners do is decide the order of transactions on any given chain, based on the rules that the chain follows.

That's a bit of a drastic comparison.  Doubling the money supply is not the same as doubling velocity.
Doubling the money supply raises the question of how you distribute the new supply.  Most ways would be unfair to the previous holders, by diluting their stake, contrary to the previously defined rules.  Fairly distributing the new coins based on stake would achieve nothing except adding more divisibility which is not required right now, with satoshis being plenty small enough.
Doubling velocity (transaction capacity) benefits everyone equally, and it was never promised that velocity would have a hard cap.  In fact, Satoshi posted about raising transaction capacity in the future when needed.  So I don't see a velocity increase as any violation of a sacred promise.
@_date: 2017-03-16 03:17:21
But don't the new versions of core signal for segwit support by default?  So if miners keep their software up to date, they should passively be signalling support.
Are the miners who are not signally segwit deliberately staying on a lower version, or have they explicitly disabled segwit signalling in the new version?
@_date: 2017-03-17 01:41:19
Hard forks have always been user-activated.  That's an intrinsic property of hard forks.
In bitcoin we don't "trust" anyone to decide the order of transactions.  That's why we have proof-of-work, so that it's trustless under the assumptions laid out in satoshi's paper.
UASF is not about trusting anyone to make a decision, it's about miners making a decision whether to mine the soft fork or not, and if they decide not, then the users who do UASF will reject their chain and the users who don't do UASF will continue to follow their chain.  However, given that segwit is a soft fork, if the UASF chain gets &gt;50% hash rate then the non-uasf chain has no choice but to follow segwit, or hard fork themselves.

If it gets less than 50% miner support, it will fork off a separate chain.  Who's going to continue to mine segwitcoin instead of bitcoin? I doubt this would be a profitable strategy to point your mining power at a contentious fork with minority hash power.

Correction: They are out of *your* network.  Or put another way, you are out of their network.  "Their network" being the current Bitcoin network as we know it today, so in a way you're leaving Bitcoin.

Correct, but the non-segwit miner could be tricked into mining a transaction that spends a segwit output in a way that violates the segwit rules, which would cause a chain fork.  So even if we assume miners are not trying to be malicious, I'd be interested to know if it's possible to relay such a transaction to them and have them mine it.

There is nothing stopping anyone forking.  They could fork today and no one could stop them.  Personally I hope they *do* fork, because the real test will be what happens after that.

There is a difference.  UASF is letting the economic majority decide which soft forks to adopt.  Proof-of-stake is letting the economic majority decide the order of transactions (ie, solving the double spending problem).

I think your proposal of a scheduled block size bump is reasonable, probably the best and simpliest option for a block size increase.  It has been proposed before.  Even Satoshi himself proposed it.
2nd layer needs to happen, regardless of what happens with block size.  On-chain will NOT scale to global currency levels at any achievable block size.
It also just makes logical sense:  the blockchain is a broadcast medium, it's highly inefficient to broadcast *every* transaction to *every* user.
2nd layer also provides *instant* trustless transactions (no waiting on confirmations) which opens up a lot of new use cases.

The decision should prioritize Bitcoin's long-term interests rather than getting caught up in short-term concerns about BU.  I can't see BU being a long term thing with such shitty code and developers.  Any rash decision that affects Bitcoin will forever taint it.
I prefer option   As fanatical as some of the BU crowd are, I don't think they'd be crazy enough to actively attack the core chain.

I see three possibilities:
1) The UASF chain could be built slower than the original chain, in which case we have a fork.  This situation can potentially remain indefinitely unless we transition to one of the below states.
2) The UASF chain could overtake the original chain, in which case non-UASF nodes will re-org onto the UASF chain and both sets of users will converge on one chain.
3) The original chain could outpace the UASF chain, but then it activates segwit through BIP9.  In this case, UASF clients re-org onto the original chain and both sets of users will converge on one chain.
Neither of these sounds good as they involve chain splits and potentially large reorgs which could cost people money.

There's no risk of them duplicating work.  The merkle root contains all transactions, including the coinbase transaction which pays the reward to the pool.  Since each pool is paying the reward to a different address, it's practically impossible that they could collide on the merkle root.

After staring at it for a 2 minutes I worked out that the X axis is the block size (ranging from 900kb on the left, to 1MB on the right), and I am guessing that the Y axis is the net number of outputs added or removed from the UTXO set.

You don't understand how mining works.  Bitcoin's PoW algorithm is "progress-free" meaning that every hash has an equal chance to produce a block, independent of all other attempts that came before it.  It's not a race, it's a lottery. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 06:58:22
Why are people giving this fork so much credibility?  How is it something we tried to avoid for years?  People have always been able to do this kind of thing with a few lines of code change.  The more significant factor in a fork is how many people follow it.  In the case of BCC, it seems to have no support, so this should not be considered a significant event.
@_date: 2017-08-02 21:09:10
No because Bcash was forked from the bitcoin ledger.  The coins are owned by the same owners who have BTC.  Only the newly mined blocks go to the BCH miners.

But 1/3 added/removed implies 1 added for every 3 removed, which would mean the set is shrinking.  I suspect they perhaps meant removed/added.
But I don't see how this illustrates broken incentives.  The UTXO set will necessarily grow regardless of incentives, if bitcoin adoption continues.

Nope, a hash rate majority can force a soft fork on the network, but they cannot force a hard fork on anyone.
@_date: 2017-08-24 12:39:29
The incentives for mining makes the network form an equilibrium between the BTC price and the network difficulty level, so that spending on mining will roughly yield the same amount of BTC that you would get on the market.
If they can mine more efficiently than the rest of the network (more hashes per $ invested), then they will be more profitable which should give them more BTC compared to buying coins directly.  If they were less efficient than most of the network, they should get less BTC than they could buy.
So it sounds like they think they can mine more efficiently than the Chinese miners.

When you receive a payment, you can validate it and confirm that the money is guaranteed to be yours, as defined by the LN smart contract, without having to trust the person to make good on an agreement.
An example of a non-trustless (or 'trusted') payment is if someone pays you with a credit card, because you're trusting that it wasn't fraudulent, as banks can reverse a fraudulent payment and take the money back.

That is how all cryptography works.  There is a secret key which, if known, will decrypt the information (or, in the case of bitcoin, sign a transaction).
A cryptosystem is secure when the keyspace is sufficiently large such that a brute force attack is infeasible.  Bip32 seeds are 128 bits, which would require around 2^128 guesses, which is well beyond what computers could achieve today or in the foreseeable future.

@_date: 2017-08-31 12:50:14
The blockchain can only grow linearly, given the block size limit.  So we don't have to worry about polynomial growth in IBD time.
Since hardware improves exponentially, over time it should reach a point where the IBD begins getting shorter over time, unless we keep raising the block size limit before that can happen.

I doubt that.  On the contrary, I think it enables companies like Bitpay to massively scale up.  Bitpay's biggest problem is high fees and limited throughput.  LN will allow them to support way more users with near-zero fees.
Also there is of course a need for BitPay since they do the conversion to Fiat and deliver the Fiat to the merchant's bank.  LN doesn't replace that.

Nonce is only a 32-bit value (~4 billion different possible values).  Modern mining hardware will blitz through that in a fraction of a second.  So miners will also modify the merkle root (a 256 bit field in the block header) by altering some fields in the coinbase transaction.
The pool will distribute work to each miner so that they're not exploring the same space as eachother.  It's a practically infinite space so there's plenty of room for people to search different spaces.

It was a soft fork, dummy.  Soft forks are backwards compatible changes.  Breaking compatibility means you're creating a new network, not upgrading the old one.

Not really true.  Would you also call a peer connected to your node a middleman?  And why do you trust your peers?  It's no different with the satellite network, it's just another peer, which means your information about the blockchain becomes strictly better.
Proof of work speaks for itself as well.  Middlemen can't forge that.

I think people have been overly focused on the immediate value of BCH following the fork, as if day 1 is significant.

Not really.  Even if we assume a payment channel only takes 250 bytes to open, that means we can open 4000 channels per block or 576000 channels per day.  That doesn't include other transactions to close channels.
Even at that rate, it would take more than 30 years before the 7 billion people on earth could even have one payment channel open each.  Without one channel open, they can't begin to use the lightning network.
There's also the "fractional-teller banking" problem - if only a few % of the world's population can actually settle their payment channel per year, then there could be a "bank run" situation where everyone rushes to close their channel while they can, to avoid being back of the queue on a 30 year transaction backlog.
7 billion users is not realistic for now, but my point is that *eventually* we have to scale on chain beyond 1MB if there is going to be mass adoption.

It just comes down to information being hard to censor.  Satoshi said that Bitcoin "takes advantage of the nature of information being easy to spread but hard to stifle".  If someone can succesfully censor you from the blockchain, then they win, but that is hard to do and to maintain.
To detect censorship, you could check the amount of work in the longest chain.  That is currently over 2^85 hashes.  Someone who controls your network can easily censor you but they cannot easily produce a chain with that much work.

You're better off using UTXO commitments.  It could be a soft forked consensus rule that miners need to include a hash of a merkle root of the UTXO set.  That way, someone who wants to semi-validate the blockchain could start from block X, download the UTXO set, and go from there.  At least this way the UTXO hash is enforced by consensus rather than just having to blindly trust a checkpoint from peers.
This also provides the possibility of stronger SPV validation because they could use the UTXO commitment to verify that coins they are receiving are unspent.

How will clients handle durability of stored transactions?  If you share a signed commitment transaction and then lose it (eg. failed disk), does that leave you at risk of losing any funds that you were owed through the channel?
I imagine that clients would need to ensure that they are using appropriately durable storage given the amount of money at risk.  For example, really large channels should not be backed by a single disk (expected ~5% chance of failure annually).  For a high stakes wallet, it might be better to integrate with a cloud storage system that can offer far higher levels of durability.

Trezor wallets can be passphrased, and each different passphrase opens a different wallet.  So you could have strong passphrases stored on paper in separate physical locations if you wanted to.
The reason to use trezor is that the spending process is secure because signing happens on the device and the keys never leave the device.  The same cannot be said for paper wallets, as you need to use software on a PC (or other general purpose computing device like phone, tablet etc) to spend them, which can have malware and be compromised.

If you understand the complexity of Bitcoin itself, then the code is fairly easy to follow.  I don't think it would be a good idea to start with the source code first.  You should start with the whitepaper, and then maybe do some further reading of the wiki to fill in some more of the implementation details.

@_date: 2016-11-26 20:23:11
A hard fork makes no sense.  It creates two coins.  Just like what happened with Ethereum, there will always be a group who stick to the original coin, and everyone who held a balance prior to the fork will own both coins.  It'll be damaging to Bitcoin (whichever fork you consider "bitcoin" to be).
A soft fork does now allow a 2nd coin to exist.  It guarantees that we *all* move together.  So I see no reason to ever choose a hard fork over a soft fork.
The argument about complexity of implementation is just a theoretical concern that has no actual impact in practice.  If the code is well written, well reviewed and well tested, then it's going to be just as maintainable as any other code.

The alternative is to only ban them after they fork.  That would be more disruptive as it would cause a big and sudden reorganisation of the network all at once, which could leave some nodes isolated.  We know they plan to hard fork, so it's safer to get the networks separated now before it happens.  In the meantime, people can still run bridge nodes to keep the chain shared between both networks.

A compressed private key in Base58Check encoding has 51 characters, but I'll assume you're leaving the first 1 and last 5 unmodified since that's the version byte / checksum.  If you changed the checksum then you're not actually hiding the private key information so you don't gain security from that.
So that would leave 45 characters to pick three from.  45 choose 3 = 45 * 44 * 43 / (3*2) = 14190 combinations.
Base 58 encoding has ~5.86 bits per character (log2(58)), so the attacker has to brute force 18 bits over those 14190 combinations. 2^18 * 14190 = ~2^31.8.
That's less than 4 billion combinations to brute force... very trivial.  Even on a single CPU that should be feasible to do.

That's not true.  A government can force commerce to be done in a new currency, and then make that currency available to be purchased at a fixed exchange rate.  When people trade in their other currencies, the government prints out new currency and adds the other currency to their forex reserves.  The exchange rate stays fixed throughout this adoption period.
A similar scenario is BCC where people got a 1:1 conversion of their existing bitcoins.

You should listen to all the people who are telling you you're wrong.
It's as simple as this.  In the event that 2x forks:

- If you're running 2x, you'll reject the core blocks
Node count has absolutely no impact on how a node validates the chain.

None of the answers given here look satisfactory to me.  There must have been a large segwit user switch to non-segwit transactions for some reason.   I assume they'll switch back to segwit at some point, since it's cheaper, and then we'll see it spike back up.

Fees aren't too bad at the moment compared to when the network was under a spam attack during the last year.  See


Fees are estimated by the wallet software, and usually you can customize them.  Sometimes some bad software can estimate poorly.  Also, the amount of fees you pay should be proportional to the size of your transaction.  Transaction size depends on the type of addresses and how many inputs and outputs you're including.  So you'd also have to compare the sizes of your transaction vs hers to do a fair comparison.

No one is banning them from having their own network.  The bitcoin network is just not peering with those nodes because they're incompatible.  Peering with an incompatible node (effectively an altcoin) would waste connection slots and cause them to be banned later anyway when they start relaying invalid blocks.  It's safer to start organising the network correctly now to avoid a sudden disruption when they become incompatible later.

Because, satoshi chose a 10 minute block interval, and to halve the reward every 4 years.  10 minutes per block = 144 blocks per day.  144 * 365 * 4 = 210240 blocks in 4 years.  So, to keep numbers simple, Satoshi made the halving every 210,000 blocks.
Due to the halving every 4 years, the rewards are 50+25+12.5+6.25... this sequence sums to 100.   100 * 210,000 = 21,000,000.
In reality, the total number of bitcoins is slightly less than 21M because the halvings don't go forever, they stop when we can no longer halve 1 satoshi.

I feel like this post frames the decentralization issue as being about the requirements for running a full node.  But I thought the real issue is about mining centralisation, which is in turn all about block propagation latency (including the time taken to validate the block).  If all we had to worry about was availability of full nodes, we could ramp up the block size much higher, because latency is not such a big deal for a full node.
@_date: 2017-10-02 03:54:32
You're totally mistaken that node count has anything to do with this.  Every user makes their own choice about which chain to follow.  If you're using a custodian service (like coinbase) then you're subject to their rules, but if you take control of your own coins then it's your choice which chain to follow.
@_date: 2016-10-22 23:44:14
Yes, so I mean it has to be confirmed underneath that block.  Ie, the transaction is only valid if it's within a chain that contains the block it commits to.  You would include the block hash of the current chain tip when signing a tx.

You can browse the blockchain on sites like these:
Personal information isn't recorded in the blockchain, but blockchain transactions are all linked together, so if someone does somehow link your name to one of your addresses, then they can potentially follow the links in the blockchain to reveal other transactions you made, or find where your money came from / went to.  There are some best practices that should minimise how much you link your transactions together.
Paypal is a different model because all their data is private.  They know everyone's identity and transactions, but the public doesn't.  The blockchain is public but the data is pseudonymous.
I wouldn't say paypal is more secure.  Bitcoin is more secure than any bank if you keep your private keys safe.  I recommend using a hardware wallet like Trezor, for an easy way to generate keys and keep them safe.

I thought I heard this idea before, that transactions could commit to a block hash.  The transaction is then only allowed to be confirmed as a child of that block.  That way, when you broadcast a tx, you 'vote' for what you believe the longest chain to be.  If miners reorg to exclude that block, then they can't include your transaction in their chain.

You're correct except for that last sentence.  It looks like you understand what hard forks / soft forks are, but I don't know why you're then trying to reject that definition.  It's a mathematical definition.  Soft forks are subsets, hard forks are supersets.  You can't be "subjective" about math.
In the last scenario, if the node chooses to not upgrade, they are still able to accept the main chain of the soft forked network because it's a subset of the blocks they would accept as valid.  The reason it's such an important distinction is because a hard fork can cause a consensus split into two divergent chains that cannot be joined. In a soft fork, that's not possible.  Therefore, soft forks are far safer as they don't risk a consensus split.

SaggyBlocks maybe?
@_date: 2016-10-23 00:34:41
The transactions can be confirmed in any block that's a child of the block hash they commit to.  So if it is valid in block N-1 then it's valid in block N.  The rule would be that you can't include a tx if its block commitment is *not* part of its chain.  It just prevents deeper re-orgs, because if you undo the last X blocks, any transactions that committed to blocks that you orphaned are now invalid.

Good luck mining even a single block with CPU/GPU, let alone the 2016 blocks required for a maximum of 4x difficulty reduction.
You're misunderstanding how mining difficulty works if you think that 'competition' is a factor.  Following the split, both chains will have the same difficulty, and so it will be equally hard to mine a block on either chain, regardless of who else is mining.
@_date: 2017-05-25 01:20:47
By "fees are too low" you mean that total fees are too low.  It doesn't mean that per transaction fees are too low since that's only one factor that makes up total fees (num_txns * fee_per_tx).  If you increase the number of transactions then the total fee increases without increasing the per-transaction fee.
@_date: 2017-05-18 14:00:37
Both statements are true.  There's no inconsistency.
Segwit is a block size increase.  You can't dispute that fact as it's just a technical fact.  Also "a block size increase leads to centralization" has had lots of evidence to support it.

Not in the case of UASF because you aren't repeatedly attempting a reorg from the tip of the chain.  BIP148 begins on August 1st and has 1 shot at building a longer chain.  It needs &gt;50% hash power to overtake.
@_date: 2017-05-30 11:12:25
I'm not so optimistic.  That video assumes, right from the beginning, that the uasf chain will activate segwit.  That's assuming a massive amount of hash power will mine on it.  I'm not so convinced.

@_date: 2017-05-31 08:26:58
I agree, there should be some room to reduce the block interval, which is a great way to scale because you're utilising the same block validation resources over more time to get more out of it.  There has been a lot of advancement in block relay latency, so there should be some room to cut down the interval.
However I think it would be a more controversial change because some might consider the block schedule sacred like the 21 million coin cap.
@_date: 2017-05-30 11:43:34


Care to substantiate this claim?  If it has less hash power than the non-UASF chain, then it's practically impossible that it can achieve a reorg.  And if UASF can't achieve a reorg then it's very likely to die, IMO.
@_date: 2017-05-31 08:20:58
The miners don't need to broadcast their transactions to the network.  They could just mine their own transactions without broadcasting, so that no one else can gain their fees.
However, it only takes one non-cooperating miner to undermine this scheme, since they will earn more than the rest of the miners by confirming more of the backlog.  So there is some game theory that should keep this kind of cartel from happening, provided that mining stays decentralized.
@_date: 2017-05-11 06:20:02

If you run Core+BIP148, isn't there a risk that you could get permanently forked from the main network, if no miners grow that chain?  What happens to BIP148 clients if the 1st block after august 1st is non-segwit-signalling, and then all miners keep building on it?
@_date: 2017-05-19 03:10:26
I haven't heard of anyone against 2MB + Segwit.  Core survived with 1MB blocks when the code was far less optimized.  So even if 2MB is a strain, clearly the network will survive.
I really don't see UASF succeeding, but that's just my opinion.
@_date: 2017-05-25 06:34:20

@_date: 2017-05-19 06:32:50
The blockchain is an append-only data structure.  New blocks are appended every 10 minutes.  So, it's correct that history cannot be modified.
However, we can make changes to the format of new blocks.  Segwit is a soft fork, so technically its a tightening of the rules about what type  of blocks can be appended.  This has happened many times in the past.
@_date: 2017-05-19 10:50:59






Could happen, but only if you get miner support for it.  You need *someone* to mine blocks on the UASF chain or it will be entirely non-functional.  That requires a pool to have the balls to orphan a non-segwit-signalling block.  If they don't get sufficient backup from other miners, they'll soon have to defect back to the main chain before they lose too much money.
So I think UASF is still highly subject to miner support.

@_date: 2017-05-02 07:30:32
Full blocks actually must be the normal steady state of the bitcoin network, for it to be viable long term.
The mining reward halves every 4 years, so soon the block subsidy will be negligible, and so miners (aka network security) will need to be funded by transaction fees.
If there is no competition for block space then the marginal cost of a transaction tends towards 0.
I am not trying to make an argument that 1MB blocks is the perfect size, but just making the point that full blocks is not actually a problem, but an expected and desired situation.
@_date: 2017-05-24 04:18:58

@_date: 2017-05-30 08:02:51
China Coin already was a currency back in the day.  It got forked really badly and died I think.  Anyone remember that?
@_date: 2017-05-09 10:03:38
That number seems to be based on non-USD pairs?  Like BTC/XRP and BTC/ETH.  The USD rate is more like $1700
@_date: 2017-05-19 04:34:23
Not dishonest, just using different terminology.  The term '2MB segwit' is being used quite commonly on this sub to refer to 2MB non-witness + segwit.  It's also clearly defined in my OP.
It's not productive to accuse people of dishonesty like that.
@_date: 2017-05-25 12:28:46
I'm wondering also.  Did you find out?
@_date: 2017-05-31 03:46:19
What's the math on saying that a 33% hash rate can likely reorg 66%?
@_date: 2017-05-01 06:11:19
Why is coinbase so much higher than bitstamp?
@_date: 2017-05-17 01:44:19
and delayed.  Not everyone can get in the next block.
@_date: 2017-05-30 10:51:26
Unlikely you can activate segwit in August with a minority hash rate.
@_date: 2016-10-29 07:43:49


That's the definition of a soft fork.
@_date: 2017-05-19 11:00:13
I think you mean 4 more times for 32k.
@_date: 2017-05-19 03:44:58
Just to be clear, I meant 2MB non-witness data.
@_date: 2017-05-28 21:52:16
Electeum lol.  Clearly you've done your research.
@_date: 2017-05-30 10:43:34
Yeah, and when they realize the reorg is never going to happen (since a 5% chain can ever overtake a 95% chain), it will be dead.  For UASF to win, it needs to reorg early on, which will require 50%+ hash power.

Actually the split would begin when the first **non**-segwit-signalling block is mined after August 1st, would it not?
@_date: 2017-05-31 15:00:28
Yes.  According to this page, there is less than 1 orphaned block per day: 
No way 10 minutes is as short as we can safely go.
@_date: 2017-07-23 07:07:29
Yes.  Thanks.  BIP 141.

DoS is an attack.  DoS prevention is security.  So how is a DoS prevention parameter not a security parameter?
@_date: 2017-05-28 08:15:55
Yeah I agree with you.  We are in the early stages of a likely $10K+ top.
@_date: 2017-07-20 20:57:48
Will BIP91 have a LOCKED_IN period before being active?  Is that also 336 blocks long?
@_date: 2017-05-31 08:12:35
Nothing.  It only benefits you, in giving you full verification of the blockchain.  And also, if you allow incoming connections, you're doing a service to the network by providing a node for lightweight clients to connect to.
The whole thing about celebrating segwit node count is misinformed.
@_date: 2017-05-11 12:20:04
It won't.  We'll be living in the future :)
@_date: 2017-07-10 03:26:23
From May 25th?
@_date: 2017-05-24 04:34:44
Electricity cost?  I thought you're cloud mining.  You don't have mining hardware right?
BTW those cloud mining operations are *always* a scam.  You'll get much more BTC if you just buy BTC directly instead of hoping for this nicehash thing to pay off.

I checked the last 4 blocks, which happened to come within the last 15 minutes, and they each had ~4BTC of fees!  16.5BTC total block reward!  That's quite a nice bounty of fees on a 1MB block.
@_date: 2017-05-02 07:06:33


What is this based on?  BU signalling is still at around 37%.  What has changed to make it out of the picture?
@_date: 2017-05-09 06:58:50
Not exuberant enough.  Still more rally to go!
@_date: 2017-05-24 18:23:17
You're GPU mining?  That stopped being viable in 2013.  These days there's no point bothering because you'll make nothing at all.
Just to confirm, you don't have actual mining hardware with ASIC chips right?
If they're paying you to run some software, most likely they're making the profit another way, like using you as a botnet or loading ads in the background or something malicious.

I'll be interested to see if any pool actually really does follow BIP148.  It's a prisoners dilemma.  Those who defect will earn nothing unless a majority goes along with it.  I think it's more likely that no one mines BIP148.
@_date: 2017-07-22 01:24:36
Won't be necessary if BIP91 is being enforced by miners at that point.
@_date: 2017-05-04 04:23:04
Looks like that place has tiny volume?  Only 100 BTC traded today?

Did you read the blog post?  Noisy proof makes sense.
@_date: 2017-05-10 06:11:40
Sounds convoluted.  Why not work with BIP32 seeds?
@_date: 2017-05-17 12:16:12
That's nice, but you won't be doing much fiat conversion if there are no blocks for you to send transactions in, lol.  You need at least some miner support for UASF to work.
@_date: 2017-07-21 03:31:59
No client is going to enforce segwit until BIP141 is activated.  BIP91 enforcement isn't segwit enforcement, it's enforcing that all blocks must signal BIP141 support.  So BIP91 is a mechanism to force BIP141 to activate.  Your core software will begin enforcing segwit when everyone else does.  The issue being discussed here is about BIP91 enforcement, which core doesn't do.
@_date: 2017-05-29 20:50:23
It doesn't work like that.  The single miner would need produce more PoW than all miners on the other chain combined.
In a situation where the uasf chain has less hash rate, time is only going to make it fall more and more behind, and so the chance of a reorg becomes more and more impossible.  For UASF to have a chance, it will need to overtake the other chain early, and have a majority of miners move over to its chain early.
I think you are misunderstanding chain height vs total work.  Non-uasf nodes will not reorg onto a chain unless it has more total PoW, regardless of chain height.  So if you're relying on drops in difficulty to try to catch the other chain, you've already lost by definition because your chain will be growing slower in terms of total PoW, there will never be a reorg.
@_date: 2017-05-31 15:20:12
The median transaction fee is less than $2.  Those $27/$49 were because they were exceptionally large transactions (in terms of their byte size).
@_date: 2017-07-31 07:04:49
What % of miners are going to mine BCC?  Is it merge-mined with Bitcoin, or are they leaving Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-07-23 02:31:38
We should save the gloating until segwit is locked in.  Better to be appreciative of the miners who are signalling for bip141 right now.

And then USD for bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-06-04 10:35:32
Good idea.  I'm getting tired of stating the obvious on here too.  I can't wait until August 1st passes and all the crazies can learn some more about how the blockchain works.
@_date: 2017-06-11 08:01:32
Hardware wallets aren't for storing backups.  The hardware wallet generates the keys and they never leave the device.  No PC will ever know the keys, unlike with your multibit wallet.
@_date: 2017-06-14 07:52:35
The obvious response from Bitmain is to keep mining the core chain so that UASF goes nowhere.  If they hard forked on Aug 1st, that would make the UASF successful.
@_date: 2017-05-10 23:53:18


Not quite.  The transactions use the same amount of data (maybe even adds some extra bytes) but segwit increases block size, so more transactions can be included in a block.
You're right about fees.  A block size increase would be expected to result in lower fees, since it's increasing the supply in the supply/demand equation.
@_date: 2017-06-04 10:16:31
Luke will only realize he's wrong after August 1st.  It's very obvious to me that the UASF chain will go nowhere.  Calling the UASF chain 'no risk' is misleading to the users who will find themselves on a dead chain after the split.
@_date: 2017-06-01 12:18:45
Interesting summary.
@_date: 2017-06-06 03:26:23
We can lock up the funds for a bottle on the blockchain, and then pay for our glasses using LN channels.
@_date: 2017-06-02 07:34:19


This seems to be a common misconception among BIP148 supporters.  BIP148 will not bring segwit on August 1st.  August 1st is when you start your chain split.  You still have to *activate* segwit with BIP9, which is going to require an enormous amount of hash power to join your fork.  It's very unlikely that you could achieve this before the end of August.
@_date: 2017-06-06 03:20:23
Bitcoin is controlled by no one.  That is why there has been a stalemate on scaling for the last 4 years.  If any one group controlled it, there would have been a solution implemented already.
UASFers will soon discover that they too do not have control to dictate consensus changes to the rest of the network.
@_date: 2017-06-04 10:58:23
No they won't.  Making that switch will lose them money as they'll be mining a dead chain, unless other miners switch too.  It's a classic prisoners dilemma.  Mark my words: no miners will switch.
@_date: 2017-06-04 10:26:56
It seems you don't understand BIP148.  Simply signalling segwit doesn't put you on the UASF side.  A miner needs to explicitly support UASF by switching their node to a BIP148 patched one.  A miner who runs Bitcoin Core and signals segwit will remain on the non-UASF chain.
@_date: 2017-06-14 08:01:08
This seems like the stupidest possible thing that Bitmain could have done.  I don't get it?
BIP148 was always dead in the water and now they've actually given it a chance by announcing that they'll remove their hash rate from fighting against the uasf chain and instead mine their alternate hardfork chain.  What the?  All they had to do was keep mining the core chain after Aug 1st until UASF inevitably dies.
@_date: 2017-06-04 10:19:44
Your chain needs more total PoW to achieve the reorg, which won't happen if it's at a lower difficulty.
@_date: 2017-06-01 12:25:36
No, they said that bitcoin was THE shit.
@_date: 2017-06-03 01:10:50
Yes, but you need to signal segwit for 95% of the blocks within a difficulty period to lock it in, and then there's one more difficulty period after that before it's actually active.  So that's at least 4032 blocks that need to be mined before it's active.
@_date: 2017-06-04 10:31:32
Good points, but no need to worry as BIP148 is all reddit hype and their fork isn't going to get mined.
@_date: 2017-06-22 22:02:36

voicing support != mining
@_date: 2017-06-16 00:40:45
Good point.  But then it's a bit strange that they declared their hardfork plan publically instead of just sending it directly to the pools that threatened them in private.
