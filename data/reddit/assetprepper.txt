YEAH DUDE... I'd delete it before people make fun of you for not knowing the right date.
@_date: 2015-01-21 20:00:56
Yes... but makes things very deniable.  :-)

It's going to bug me all the way to the Super Bowl.  It's probably going to be something Valentine's Day related cause they have a valentine day heart at the end of the commercial.  So who knows.  But I'm going to keep my fingers crossed.  :-)

Using safari... and link goes to a blank page that says "please use chrome or firefox.  What is it?  So, I don't have to download the browsers.
@_date: 2015-01-19 04:50:13
Yes... I think it was.  That was a long time ago.  I'm almost as old as MtGox... I'm getting to old to remember some of these things.  :-)

It's a love affair that you just won't understand...

They will have more than 100 Years to figure that out... and they will figure it out as it diminishes to that point in time.  besides... they can always charge small fees to carry the transactions...   Why make a big deal of this now by quoting this guys response like he's going to have an answer for something that will be solved after he dies?
@_date: 2015-01-15 09:23:06
Been in it a while to see the ups and downs... this is how I feel.
@_date: 2015-01-19 06:16:01
YES... That's it!
@_date: 2015-01-27 21:59:28
I think they are implying that you can post your public address.  It's what ever fee someone wants to pay to send bitcoins to you.  Reddit doesn't need to get involved in the transaction.
@_date: 2015-01-15 09:36:07
Unfortunately, I'm locked in at the higher price... cause I don't day trade.  But for sure... every pay check it's down this low... I'm buying triple if not a little more than what I normally would.  Bitcoin can go lower if it wants... I don't really care.  It just means, bitcoin is giving me a chance to catch up.  :-)  
FYI... every time there has been a long term sustained crash like this... there is a bubble in the near future.  It has me wondering what we will be talking about come March,April,May....??? :-)
@_date: 2015-01-19 04:12:06
I agree.  :-)

He's huge... and his bull-dog, named Willybot, has teeth as sharp as razors.  Saw it bite into the BearWhale... Sent the BearWhale to the hospital.  After the BearWhale sued his ass... Left the the BullWhale with about $200 bucks in his bitcoin account.  So, now I hear BullWhale picked up some day trading classes... maybe he will come out of hiding when he figures it all out.

I don't buy the cyprus story either.  When it was going on... I still was in the mindset that bitcoin was too small.  It's possible that there was panic across europe that it would spread... maybe it bought up the days worth of the coins and then some... but I don't buy the whole story either.
@_date: 2015-01-27 22:00:01
How soon are we looking at having something like this?
@_date: 2015-01-19 06:21:20
If you follow this kind of stuff... I'm about to start a podcast that uses a sub that I created.... Feel free to subscribe if you're into that kind of stuff.  I haven't publicly announced it yet... just in case the intro video, that I'm posting on youtube, sucks.  I want to work out the kinks before I hit up a couple of threads.  Either way... my sub targets current events and how they match up with being a prepper... and that assets don't have to be physical only.  They could be skills and location based.  I'm still playing with the CSS code that I mostly copy and pasted for the sub.  
Let me know what you think.
@_date: 2015-01-19 05:06:42
curios to know what you fully meant...


@_date: 2015-01-19 17:41:18
True that!  It's been a long time since I've seen a good one.  At the beginning of last year.. a bunch were released.  It's like that well dried up for now.
@_date: 2015-01-15 09:32:00
Ok... thanks!  :-)

What about bitaddress mouse curser movements with random keyboard pushes..  ?  Does it affect that?  Cause doesn't it apply a random number generator to that as well?  Or are the mouse movements with keyboard the randomness needed?
@_date: 2015-01-19 05:07:24
lol  :-)

Those days are behind us now... nothing but upshot going forward.  :-)

Um... wrong part of your story... Goes to jail and never gets out.  Makes money that can't buy cigarettes while locked up in the fed pen.  That's just how it works there.
@_date: 2015-01-15 17:02:37
@_date: 2015-01-19 04:12:36
I agree too... at a bare minimum... interesting to see how it plays out.  :-)
@_date: 2015-01-28 04:24:59
I agree... people are not getting the fundamentals of internet cash.  Just a few years ago... how else could you crowd source this payment without bitcoin?  The devil is in the details... and they want to talk about a naked celeb photo that was stolen.  
@_date: 2015-01-19 17:46:31
Good point! 
@_date: 2015-01-15 06:00:55
TL;DR... What's it trying to tell us in layman's terms?
@_date: 2015-03-05 19:19:03


I sneeze and say the BS word.  hehe   I don't believe it... and even if you had a fire safe... the temp in your fire safe will get very warm and potentially ruin your image.  Real paper with laser print would pretty much last forever.  I've seen many thermal paper reciepts fade over just a couple of years when I look at old tax refunds.  Heck... some of them don't even last a year when it comes time to file the next year.  Too each their own on this risk.  I'm only making people aware of this issue.
@_date: 2015-03-05 19:20:50
I didn't know you could connect it to an offline printer.  Do you have a link that says this?  I looked over their website.. but not nothing jumping out at me.
@_date: 2015-03-02 05:30:01
You should also advise... that thermal printer paper is known to fade with in a year or two.  I also question what would happen if you put it in a fire safe and had a fire.  Yes, the paper might not burn up... but the heat might be so intense that the thermal paper would react to it and you would lose your private keys.  
Just a little buyer beware.
@_date: 2015-02-13 08:35:25
Bitcoin, connecting people across arbitrary borders.
Bitcoin, borders are only arbitrary.

Rarely do I see mBTC.  Almost always Bitcoin and bits.

It's everywhere you wish you could be.

How old is she?
@_date: 2015-02-09 22:18:32
My visual translation is... They promised her all kinds of riches and the price of bitcoin collapsed... and the company couldn't run their Ponzi scheme with such a low bitcoin price.  They tried to confront the company but found the doors were locked.  
Does that work?  :-)
@_date: 2015-02-09 21:29:33
Could you define....


Please explain how that is going to happen.

Bitcoin, Flat broke insurance.  hehe
