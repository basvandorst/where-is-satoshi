I also have zero friends in crypto. It’s still adapting
@_date: 2019-07-01 10:07:22
Weird flex. Hope you’re not getting hacked
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:39:08
Yes I'm experiencing 14€ transfer fee as well. I guess this is standard as other exchanges charge you 20$ minimum fee.

I once enjoyed this sub. Now every post is people asking to sell/buy or begging for BTC. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 10:29:52
Yes this post is a bit confusing 
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:40:46
Thank you all for your kind responds! 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:38:26
Same goes to Bitpanda
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:07:23
You can buy most coins there. But to buy Alt coins you use BTC. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:50:34
I use Bitpanda - and can deposit a large amount very easy. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:03:53
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:03:59
Why wouldn’t you? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:13:54
I don’t fit into any of your stereotypes - should I sell or hold? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:54:25
Oh shit I’m sorry pal... I feel blessed to be in my early 20s so I can speculate in crypto without worrying too much about losing my economy and the fear of losing it all. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:08:44
I was thinking about this. But wouldn’t it be better to buy monthly compared to weekly, because of the fees? 
@_date: 2017-12-17 06:13:00
I use Poloniex. Great exchange IMO. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:04:42
Kraken as well
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:43:58
Done! I hope you’re aware of this segment is heavily invovled in bitcoin. You won’t get very diversed answers from this sub.
@_date: 2017-12-15 08:03:09
Different people take different risks. If you ever want big success you will have to take big risks. 
Also in mid 20s, at least I can afford to risk my entire savings. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:50:44
Will the Nano Ledger S do the job? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:39:16
Where is all this begging coming from Jesus christ, delete this shit. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:41:55
I see... been trying for a good week now. 
Do you have any recommendations for a good user friendly exchange? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 09:01:52
HODL whatever happens
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:20:40
thank you! 
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:17:34
Great! 
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:11:22
Protection level 4 right now. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:47:02
Minus 1 that’s 3 quick maths
@_date: 2019-11-24 12:12:20
Well, then you’ve made a mistake
@_date: 2019-06-27 14:42:03
It’s a global price my man
@_date: 2019-10-11 17:55:18
Oh man, i’ve done a lot with my coins since. It’s unpredictable, but I might try out your strategy.
@_date: 2019-06-27 16:04:08
Hodl would beat this strat
@_date: 2019-06-17 16:42:18
Wtf did I just watch. Some powerpoint from 2002?
@_date: 2019-06-27 14:49:10
At this very moment 1 bitcoin is $11737. 
However, you don’t have to buy an entire bitcoin, you can buy as little/much as you’d like.
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:51:17
If you can’t afford to lose it, you should not invest it.
@_date: 2019-06-27 23:06:37
Thanks for the heads up. I'm getting tired watching the price so intensely. Good luck to you all
@_date: 2019-06-27 16:51:01
Sell and buy back more
@_date: 2019-06-22 13:30:41
But downvote is meant for disagreeing?
@_date: 2019-06-27 14:57:45
All sell now please. I wanna fill my bags as cheap as possible
@_date: 2019-06-27 16:52:08

@_date: 2019-06-27 14:50:39
Been hodling since oct 17’ as well. These bumps doesn’t even touch me anymore.
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:57:38
Yes, all weak hands please sell. I need a bigger bag
@_date: 2019-06-28 18:23:12
It will probably decrease at first, and then increase.
@_date: 2019-06-27 19:05:48
Because being a pussy is not my thang
@_date: 2018-02-06 21:12:33
