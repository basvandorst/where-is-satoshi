Assuming that only the public-key crypto (ECDSA) is compromised, bitcoin as a whole would not be entirely compromised. It is recommended to not reuse bitcoin adresses as the public key is only revealed when sending bitcoins. To retrieve the public key from an unspent adress, both SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160 would need to be compromised as well. 
If everyone takes this precaution it should be possible to switch the private key crypto without too much damage.
TL;DR Do not reuse adresses.

Disregarding bits to make it act like a 4-sided die will require more dice throws to get the required entropy (128 throws for 256 bit) than strictly needed.
My immediate thought was that there should be simple way of mapping the base 6 nature of the die into base 2. Like grouping 2 or 3 dice throws to get an even distribution for a given number of bits.
It seems however, that it is not that simple. Each 6 die throw will yield 2.58496..... bits of entropy. ([source]( Uniform distribution would require log2(6^n) to be integer for some integer value of n (the number of throws) and it seems that this is never the case.
It is theoretically possible to use 99 throws with 6 sided dice to get 255.91 bits of entropy ([source]( however the algorithm needed for this is beyond me.
**Edit:** Lunch made me realize how this could be implemented, consider this pseudocode:
    big_ass_int key=0;
    big_ass_int foo;
    for (int n=0; n&lt;=98; n++) {
        foo = get_die();               /* Value of die from 0-5 */
        foo = foo * pow (6, n);        /* value of die times 6 to the power of n */
        key+=foo;
    }
This would need a math library capable of huge integers (256 bit). The result wouldn't be able to go all the way up to 0xFFFFF......FF as the entropy isn't quite 256 bits, but it shouldn't matter for any practical reasons. The entropy is pretty close to max, and more importantly, the distribution from minimum value to maximum is uniform.

I am aware of the potential blocksize increase, this does however require people to actually make segwit transactions. Whether this will happen is really anyone's guess. (One could argue using the adaption over on LTC, but that is unfair as LTC is hardly the driving factor in cryptocoin development). I am looking forward to see its effect though.
There is absolutely no shortage of people willing to pay the current fee, but it might still be a considerable amount of people not willing or able to. 
In the future, miners will need to have their expenses paid by fees, so a goal of next to zero fee for on-chain transactions is just ridiculous. But as I mentioned, I fear that we in this pre-lightning world are loosing that initial revolutionary feeling that brought most of us here, and which should still be bringing more people into it.
A thing you touched on here, and in other replies, which I am curious to hear your input on is: Who controls bitcoin?
My argument here is that it is, and will always be, the miners. 
My reasoning is that mining (development, production and running) is many times more expensive than running nodes. So as long as bitcoin uses SHA-256, any entity (be it a single, or a cartel of many) which controls a significant majority of the worlds SHA-256 hashing power will always have the ability to control bitcoin. By diverting miners to manipulate difficulty, mining 0-transaction blocks on undesired chains and other shenanigans. 
Nodes not conforming to their will can be a hindrance, but server time for nodes can be bought, probable for much less than mining costs.
Miner centralization is in my mind a huge problem for bitcoin, but I don't see any way the users or developers can actually take this power back, barring a change of the PoW-algorithm. And this is actually one of the few major flaws of bitcoin. No PoW-algorithm is ASIC-proof, but SHA-256 is quite the opposite, ASIC-friendly.
For now the economic interests of miners, users, developers seem to align, but who knows what the future will bring.

You seem to insinuate a fallacy, I however fail to see how the inherent properties of a piece of technology is determined by the morality of its creators. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 16:15:05
First I have to say, thank you for replying in a serious and well-reasoned fashion. I do agree for the most part with everything you say here, and my concerns are mostly as follows:
I feel the fees are now getting to a point where they soon will limit the usability of bitcoin quite significantly.
A personal anectote: A few days ago I helped out a guy I know absolutely nothing about with a technical issue, and got a small reward in bitcoin. This was a personal reminder of how groundbreaking and revolutionary this technology is, and a throwback to my first experiences with bitcoin.
I fear for a near future where this kind of experience is impossible, and bitcoin will be for a select few, while the rest never gets to experience its potential. I.e. what's the point of planning for eternity if almost no one gets to use it.
I do however accept that it is absolutely impossible to record every coffee transaction on a distributed network for all eternity. I therefore can't wait to see lightning and other off-chain solutions, and sincerely believe they will have the power to keep bitcoin the revolutionary technology it is.
For this reason I believe a compromise is needed. The 8MB hard fork is in my opinion unnecessarily hostile, and seems to overshoot the target. I agree that any block size will probably fill up quickly, and we need to find a balance between bloat and usability.
This is why I felt that the Segwit2X compromise was the best news for bitcoin in quite a while. It still follows the roadmap of the core developers, and the agreements between (some?) developers and miners (I am aware of the politics in this regards though). But it still addresses an immidiate problem bitcoin has. I don't agree that it is a hostile takeover. Miners, users, and economic majority will thankfully always decide what bitcoin is and isn't in the end.
A secondary concern is one of "image". The hostility and polarisation is in itself a problem for bitcoin. The lack of civilized discussion, blatant trolling and brigading, and general hostility, makes an environment where compromise is seen as a failure. It reinforces conspiratory beliefs, and I fear this might limit the development of bitcoin. 
There seems to be conflicts of interest on all sides of this discussion, and I fear the hostility might centralize and limit development. I see this mostly from Reddit though, and hope it is mostly confined here, and that users and developers outside of this bubble are blissfully unaware.
@_date: 2017-08-23 16:36:02
I apologize for answering a bit short here, but I will try to answer none the less.
1. I don't necessarily hate core. The premise was a bit hyperbolic, so my answer was as well. I do however feel they are more conserned with "being right", than doing what is best for bitcoin. And they are therefore sowing unnecessary dissent. There are also some conflicts of interest (which there admittedly are plenty of in the btc1 and 8MB camp as well), and it seems to be a centralization of developement.
2. I do trust the quality of their work, they seem to be very competent developers.
3. (EDIT: Why did Reddit change 4. to 3. after I submitted) 
4. I am OK with a change of the consesus rule if the miners, users and economic majority wants it. 
5. I am OK with Segwit2X, and I believe if the hard fork is successful, developers will build upon this and continue to improve bitcoin regardless of the name of the team.

@_date: 2017-08-23 15:05:14
That makes sense. And I very much agree, there is a tendency to see the miners as a single entity, which I believe is still quite a bit from the truth. I do however believe there are a not insignificant number of users (and possibly miners), who likes Segwit and Lightning, still sees a need for a proper blocklimit increase, and find the polarisation, hyperbole and vitriol in the communities discouraging. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 19:54:45
I also really appreciate this conversation.
You understood my premise, and we are in complete agreement that this is not what bitcoin should be. Hash power as a proxy for user mass was a great idea, and worked for a long time, but now a regular user feels a bit powerless. Even if all users agreed, and put all their collective computing power to use, it would barely make a dent in the global hasing power. 
What should be a system where the user pays the miners to do a task (verify and secure transactions), has ended up with the users having to buy security from the sole provider of it. 
I.e. a minority (SHA-256) fork will never be secure as long as there is a majority of hashing power dormant. 
This might be a cause for why some users feel disconnected from the core developers.  The users assume their interest aligns at least to some extent with the miners. As the miners wants the coins to be worth as much as possible, they will probably not do any changes that threatens the economy of it too much, and the user wants the security of the most hash power. 
It is not as easy to see (without conversations like this), how the interest of the user overlaps with what might seem like a few select developers, more or less distanced from the community of the user.
It is a matter of where do you put your faith. Are the miners hostile or honest? Are the developers zealots or visionaries? Are the miners controlled by major capital? Are the developers controlled by major capital?
 
This takes us back to the start a bit. As a regular user, with good technical understanding, but not a regular reader of mailing lists and other channels (and I believe there are a few of us). It is difficult to know who to believe. There seem to be competent developers on both sides. There seems to be some economical conflicts of interests on both sides. There seems to be good arguments on both sides. But the last year has been a tedious year of name calling, yelling and general inflation of hostility.
The Segwit2X, at least to me, seemed like a small step towards some unity between the different actors in the bitcoin scene. A way to confirm the shared interest in bitcoin's future for all. But I also see that it can be viewed as a slippery slope.
And to answer your question. Yes, if many economical players backed out of the agreement, I would say the "morality" of the fork would greatly diminish. As a user, the major economical players serve as a sort of check and balance to the miners and developers.
But I would probably still feel powerless to the miners. Which sort of comfirmes that to some extent bitcoin has failed its original purpose. Bitcoin will not go away for a long time yet, but it is going to be interresting to see what it will become.
But I will say it has been a pleasure to have a civil conversation about this, and you have at least done an excellent job of proving the core supporters are not mindless sheep as some would have us believe.

That is my sentiment as well, however it is not only the miners who defines what bitcoin is. In the event of a fork it is also the user base. 
If for instance all miners would implement a bitcoin fork which kept the block reward at 25 indefinately, the original bitcoin wouldn't go away. If the majority of the user base considered the original bitcoin the correct one, they could fire up GPUs and old Jalapeño paperweights and keep it going (albeit slowly). It would then be up to the miners which chain to support. The one with the users (and presumably also monetary value), or the one with high block reward.

I believe it incorrectly assumes that *tr0ub4d0r* is 8 combinations of 8-bit symbols (256 variatons), when it actually is 8 combinations of a symbol set of 36 variations (lowercase a-z, and 0-9). The entropy of tr0ub4d0r is therefore much much lower. The explain xkcd page calculates this at 19 bits of entropy.
EDIT: This assumes a priori knowledge of the symbol set. Entropy calculations are a bit fuzzy in this respect.

@_date: 2015-08-14 15:10:15
No, the whole point of this is that even with a dictionary of only 2048 words, the entropy of *correct horse battery staple* is larger than *tr0ub4d0r*. See the explain xkcd link above.

I have followed the discussion for a fair time and it seemed to reach a stalemate a long time ago. Running BIP 101 is therefore a way for the crowd to publicly voice their wish for block size increase (or at least a plan for it).
This should be unproblematic, as it is compatible with core for the time being, it is just another bitcoin implementation. It has not forked the blockchain yet (and probably never will unless it is included in core). 
When it is seen as an altcoin and shunned from all major public fora, running it is gets another dimension as well. It becomes a reminder that bitcoin is defined by its users. In the end the users will always decide what bitcoin is and isn't. This exposes it to the tragedy of the commons, but this is inherent in a distributed system run by individuals.
This is why I run a BIP 101 compliant node. It is not necessarily the best solution, but it is a way to voice my opinion on the matter.
Personally I still hope for a consensus in core, which I believe would be the best for all.
