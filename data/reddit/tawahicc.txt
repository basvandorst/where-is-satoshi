"the site would have to be compromised" is exactly my nightmare.

The most important attribute of sapiens is our ability to create and share immaterial things : beliefs, narratives, stories such as Nations, Religions, Stocks, Companies and Money.  Bitcoin is a new kind of narrative, once it makes its way into the brain of a number of sapiens, there is no going back.

I can't help to think these are just paid ads by LedgerX, Deribit and Skew

But "somebody" can be compromised, the amount of money at stake here is not negligible. The only consolation I have is this thought: the minute Trezor/Ledger are massively hacked, bitcoin price will tumble making the hack almost worthless.  But then I think that nation-states might be interested in creating havoc on bitcoin markets.

not to mention that bitcoin is better money than fiat because is harder to manipulate/create/debase

If you think that hodling is the reason btc is mooning in the future, think of the amount of bitcoin that will be locked in the LN earning a small interest as routing fee.

what is "santo"?, an electric company?
what is 0.057kwh? consumption per second?
What is your energy cost?
what is the price of the equipment?
so many questions...

I see it more like a warning call to us humans: beware the megalomaniacs, they exist and want to live forever at your expense

Bitcoin as a method for payment is a Troy Horse, for bitcoin to succeed it is not needed that the whole population uses it, just a few users are needed to bootstrap a closed loop economy where participants will be able to partially evade income taxes (only those) and store wealth without questions.   There are billions of dollars being transacted in the black market every day, they are represented in private ledgers by well trusted finance connected people, hidden offshore bank accounts (but that is being bulldozed) and old plain cash and gold bars.  Bitcoin is bootstrapping itself with those markets, but it needs a few legitimate uses (Horse costume) in order to prevent it being forbidden by governments. My opinion is that that point already passed sometime during 2017. There is no going back, if the US starts banning bitcoin usage, Japan will authorize it and people will just move their money to Japan or Korea or Belice, whatever...
Now listen carefully, this is just the bootstrapping process. At some point , businesses that operate (receive) Bitcoin will have clear advantages (more sales but also because they can under report sales) and their competitors will be forced to receive bitcoin or die.
Then suddenly gardeners, plumbers, attorneys, corrupt politicians, will demand to be paid in bitcoin or at least give you some discount. Naturally, prices in fiat will start to grow and there will be no interest rate to appease them.
This is not the end of civilization, its the end of nation-states managment of monetary policy and the end of income taxes. Nation states will still exist and provide services, but they will abide to the market forces. Taxing will still exist but based on property and resource usage. Think of 5 USD/gallon gas and 1500 USD property taxes per month but not paying income tax, other things like land will be cheaper because speculators will be losing money by hoarding it.

I actually worry more about the new firmware being hijacked to send the private key encrypted on the first transaction you try to make, or more subtly : leaked in several transactions a few bits at a time encoded as part of the fee.  Is there any electronics expert that helps me sleep well again?
