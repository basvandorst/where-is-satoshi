That I will not do. No matter how much BTC you donate =)

I think you should =)

Well, it's not as important as in the US, for sure, but still important. You still need pretty much money to run a campaign. And this is also a chance for the Bitcoin community to show it's strength. If I succeed, others will follow, and around the workd we'll have Bitcoinfriendly lawmakers. That is important.

I voted no to the extension of the FRA-law, FRA 3.0. I also voted no to the implemenation of the EU data retetion law. I wasn't in Parliament when the other votes took place.

Agree! Bitcoin isn't in almost any mainstream discussions in Sweden.

I voted no to the implemation of the law in Swedish law, i May 2012, when I served in Parliament. You are right that I wasn't yet in Parliament in March 2012, when the first vote took place.
You can see the voting procedure here:
Just click on the video.
I was all alone, sadly.
You can also check out the article (in Swedish) I wrote prior to the vote:

That might be true in other countries, but in Sweden campaign donations play a smaller part then in the US for example. I think this is a great chance for the Bitcoin community to show that it's strong and can be taken seriously.
