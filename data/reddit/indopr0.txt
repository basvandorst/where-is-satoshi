There's a lot of place to spend!
Overstock is there for your bedding, furniture, and other needs, BitcoinStore.com have nice computer parts there, you can have your HDD/SSD there.
You want to bet? No problem! bitbook is there. (THEY GOT ESPORTS SECTION TOO)

I agree (except for spelling) with your point.
RBS did not go with all the money like MtGox. RBS got the money, tries to make a profit, failed. £46m losses, but it's not like Gox.
Gox? Got the money and BTC, went missing with all your currencies.

Disgustingly revealing. He's not safe anymore now. Hell, everyone with a bit of google-fu will spot his address in no time.

Devil's advocate : How if you got scammed? So if you buy something and then the items that you purchased did not come, can you ask a refund?
With paypal, you can call them, say it's a scam, provide proof, ???, profit.

The Halving Celebration will be bigger than this.
