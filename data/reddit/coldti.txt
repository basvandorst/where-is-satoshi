1M units in 2017?!  Incredible!  Between Ledger and Trezor It's likely 2M+ 
This seems to be a signal that crypto is beginning the rising edge of the S-curve!

The case provides an extra level of security by keeping prying eyes or cameras from capturing a glance of the seed digits.
The case has tamper resistant Torx security screws. You can also apply tamper resistant serial numbered holographic decals over the screws and around the case halves if you wanted even more tamper resistance.  This would at least let you know if the case halves had been removed and card compromised.

Thanks for the interest. The aluminum enclosures will be Type II anodized which will greatly decrease electrolysis between dissimilar metals.

Hey Thanks for all the great advice since our last posting. We are super proud to announce that we are ready to launch a Kickstarter to hopefully get this product off the ground. With any luck we'll all have a cost effective and reliable cold storage backup in our hands before the end of the year!

We feel that our delivery estimates are accurate and should not extend into 2018.

Don't forget to CNC mill, drill, tap, and anodize your own case/enclosure :)

Our solution uses Titanium.  Brass has a much lower melting temperature (1650F) and will corrode over time. Titanium melts at 3000F and it does not corrode as it forms it's own durable oxide layer.
Our Kickstarter is for those who want a Titanium solution in one complete kit.

May we recommend our titanium seed storage plates? 
 
@_date: 2019-02-16 06:33:54
The tool at iancoleman.io works for me with your seed words. Scroll down to the derivation path and select which derivation scheme you want. Then scroll down to derived addresses and find your public and private keys

Might I suggest ColdTi titanium seed storage plates?  
@_date: 2018-11-03 01:05:50
Awesome! Glad you like it! Feel free to post a review on Amazon ����
@_date: 2017-07-27 14:26:00
This would be great!

ColdTi team here.  The screws are actually powder coated aluminum.  If stamping by hand, nothing should be able to be seen from the other side.  Here is photo and video proof:

We feel the purpose of the enclosure is for long term storage of the Ti plate and intend that the enclosure would rarely be opened.  Likely only in occasions where a hardware wallet is lost/damaged or someone wants to activate an HD wallet for funds withdrawal.
But, perhaps we can consider two enclosures.  One for long term storage and one that offer protection but easier access to the Ti plate.  Will consider this.
@_date: 2017-06-27 14:24:57
The enclosure is G10-FR4.  It has a UL94 fire resistent rating of V0.  In other words, it doesn't burn so much as it smolders.  It's primarily made of glass with a high temp resistant epoxy binder.

Anyone who doesn't want to fiddle with striking metal with a punch should most certainly go the easier route and buy a Cryptosteel.
For those who like to tinker the Cold Ti may be an option for them. 
It seems like you're trying to make a case that we are saying we are a superior option to Cryptosteel.  Not at all! We're simply saying our unit can accomplish the same result in a different manner.  Customers can be the judge of which they'd like to try and that's fine with us!
@_date: 2017-06-27 14:50:16
Interesting thought experiment.  
The stamp tools are made from hardened tool steel. 
Using them to stamp a few titanium plates will not reveal any evidence of use frequency.
Now... if the stamps were used in full production stamping out the numbers for hours per day, days per week, you might just begin to find enough evidence for analysis.
Zero risk factor for the way they are going to be used on Cold Ti.

No.  The master list of seed words is committed in the BIP39 standard.
Any other word list that may future exist would be part of a different BIP.
Here's the word list for BIP39
@_date: 2017-06-27 16:13:03
3mm.  Your 5/32 (4mm) should work fine. As long as your punches are hardened tool steel it'll work.  I don't know of any punches that aren't tool steel so I'm guessing you are good to go.
@_date: 2017-06-27 14:36:53
Ripoff of Cryptosteel?
That's a stretch and about as valid as saying brand X automobile is a ripoff of brand Y because they both have wheels, power source, and can get you from A to B.
The Cryptosteel is a fantastic product but is quite different than Cold Ti. Both store a seed but use two entirely different seed encoding mark methods.

Not as safe as storing your own keys, but safer than the regular Coinbase wallet or on their GDAX exchange.
Make sure you are using an authenticator 2FA and you increase your security considerably!
@_date: 2019-05-27 15:25:10
Did you ever complete the KYC requirements at Coinbase? If so, then they will confirm your identity (in some way) and allow you access.
@_date: 2017-06-27 02:23:23
This is a project we are about to launch on Kickstarter.
It's a kit that includes a 2mm thick titanium plate, number punches and an optional enclosure. You supply a hammer and a half hour of your time.
The BIP39 seed words are stamped as their assigned numbers (1-2048) rather than spelling out the word. This method makes it easy since only numeric metal stamp kit is required.
Titanium melts at over 3000°F (1600°C) and is highly resistant to corrosion. It's similar to stainless steel, but lighter and more durable. 
Backing up your seed words in this manner does not expose your keys to a computer, lasts for nearly an eternity, and is fun/easy to make!
Still working on the Kickstarter campaign but it should go live this week or next.
Go easy... :)  I'm a DIY/maker/serial entrepreneur and always dabbling in something.  Maybe this will be a hit... maybe not!  But we're going for it either way.
ohh.... and the seed words shown on the prototype are not an actual wallet, but any curious ones can try if you must :)

Not trying to dodge, just being up front and explaining that we're still working on some pricing models based on forecast market numbers we think might exist. Part of the reason we're posting here on reddit is to gather some data for this purpose. Have mercy:) We're not out to be scoundrels.
Rest assured the pricing will be clearly disclosed at the time of the Kickstarter launch. Kickstarter wouldn't have it any other way! :)

Clearly, Hal Finney was unaware of the customary ways of Japanese names when he wrote the white paper.
@_date: 2017-06-27 15:07:53
The kit will come with a practice steel plate.  
We've already done some experiments and given the plate and stamp kit to people who have never tried stamping.  All of them had good success within a dozen strikes.
Store your seed and learn a new skill  :)
But in those cases where a mistake is made or a new wallet needs made, we'll certainly be offering replacements plates.
@_date: 2017-06-27 04:31:06
Two issues with this. 
1) No one or should ever trust anyone with their seed words. If they do not have their own laser etching machine they would have to give the words to someone who does. Bad. Never do this!
2) No one should ever input their seed words into a computer.  Laser etching necessarily means putting them into a computer. Bad. Never do this!
@_date: 2017-06-27 03:33:49
We will be supplying non-heat treated titanium which is not difficult to stamp.  One quick blow with a hammer on the punch and the mark is left quite well. No power tools required.  The point of the product is that anyone with basic skill, the kit, and a hammer can create the backup. Also, we'll be supplying the kit with a practice piece of steel of similar hardness to titanium in order to get the feel for it before stamping the Ti plate.
The actual titanium plate is not much larger than credit card size.  It's 2.5" x 4".  Credit cards are 2" x 3.5".  The enclosure is 3/8" larger all around. But, if we get enough requests of sizing it a bit smaller we'd certainly consider it!
@_date: 2017-06-27 14:20:24
Thx. will post the link once it goes live.
@_date: 2017-06-27 14:23:21
There will be no brand markings anywhere that could identify what it is. 
@_date: 2017-06-27 14:21:21
We will be offering just the titanium plates as spares or for multiple wallets.
@_date: 2017-06-27 04:09:54
This is part of what is still being worked out.  Economy of scale plays heavily into the pricing and trying to predict how much interest there will be in this product is tricky.
We're going to offer three different reward tiers on kickstarter. 
One is a titanium plate only for those who already have a punch set or those who wish to hand engrave it with an electric engraver. 
A second will include a titanium plate, punch set, and a practice steel plate. 
The third will be the same as the second but will include the machined G10 composite enclosure kit.
The plan is to set our funding goal high enough that a large production batch will be required which will allow us to offer the kits at attractive prices.
