DON'T. USE. VENMO. FOR. BITCOINS.
I've already suffered a debilitating blow by someone scamming me and if I can stop someone else from being scammed, it'll at least make me feel a little less like a pile of doo doo. 
 
I don't want to bore you with the whole story of the process of how I got scammed. So I'll just sum it up. Venmo is a service that facilitates payments using debit cards/bank accounts/credit cards and what not. After reading the terms of agreement and FAQ it is so easy to get payments reversed... all you need to do is email Venmo and tell them it was sent to the wrong person or it was a fraudulent charge and Venmo will automatically reverse the payments. Either that or if you call your credit card company saying the charge was fraudulent as well. They will revoke the funds and return it to the sender. 
I'm out a decent sum of money because of this. The buyer bought some BTC from me, sent the money, and then hours later the payment got cancelled and reversed. 
The WORST thing is that Venmo DOES NOT HAVE A PHONE NUMBER to call. So the only way you can contact them is through email. I've been trying to email them for the past couple of days, reached them out on facebook, Hell I even tweeted them. Yet still no response... I know in the back of my head I'll never see those BTC again... but it was such a devastating hit for me. 
I have to exhaust every effort I can to reach out to them. They are honestly no different then Dwolla, Paypal and whatever payment facilitator online. They all have the ability to do chargebacks and reverse your payments. 
TL;DR DON'T. USE. VENMO. FOR. BITCOINS.
