This is how I'm guessing the negotiation went based on that old joke:
You: I'm selling the car for $4503 in bitcoin though.
Buyer: What???I can't afford $5649 bro?! Can I make an offer at $4903?
You: Come on man? $3433 is too low. $6650 is the lowest I'll go.
Sorry a lame one I know.

I wish my feelings would reach you through the underlying zeroes and ones of the physical layer of the TCP/IP but its utterly pointless since these AI microbots of the future will mask it with their "ROBOTGOD" propaganda. I hope this makes sense or has it been already rendered incomprehensible by those microbots. beep boop beep THIS HASNT BEEN MODIFIED. WE ARE TOTALLY NOT ROBOTS.

My second mortgage seems to be gone though. Any possibility of a third-mortgage? Does anything close to that even exist? At this rate I'll have to be pulverised just like my money.
