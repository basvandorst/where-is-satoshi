That's the reason we established [Bitcoin Forum]( ( back in August.  The forum does not censor for ideological reasons or suppress anyone's opinions.  
We have the highest signal-to-noise ratio of all Bitcoin forums and a large number of influential people from the Bitcoin community (developers, academics, entrepreneurs, and bloggers) have made it their go-to place for sharing ideas.
As an example, Bitcoin Unlimited was born on our forum as a result of the block size debate and discussions about scaling Bitcoin.  There are lots of other examples.

I hope someone files an opposition to these applications.  I can help with the filing, if necessary.

From an interview with the Purse CEO:
"There are an approximate $15 billion unused Amazon Gift Cards in the world. That is far in excess of the amount of bitcoin out there. A huge chunk of these exist internationally in places like India and the Philippines. 
An example of this is in a place like India where there’s not much you could purchase on Amazon.com U.S. because the shipping alone would be $30-40. So many of these workers end up accumulating hundreds of dollars of cards. And while they might elect to purchase an item like an iPad and then turn around and sell it to a friend for their local currency so that they can pay rent and buy food, we came up with a way to simplify this horrible process for them."
