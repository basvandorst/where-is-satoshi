Thats not what a fork is fucking jihan wu ruined the word hardfork, devs cant use it anymore with out noobs coming in and asking when bittrex is going to give them free coins, chainsplit is a possibility of a fork not a direct result

well seeing as the price has been bear for year(s) the small miners already capitulated miner hardware has already flooded market u van pick it up cheaply used.
I see halvening being positive bull signal

no I said cost to mine doubles as the blocks minted reward half of what they used to 
if a miner was making 12.5 bitcoin a month hes now making 6.25 bitcoin a month now but his cost of running is the same and now hes making less bitcoin. the only thing that will make it worth while is if the price of bitcoin goes up to adjust. it usually does around haleving and after wards bitcoin boom.bust.boom.bust repeat were ending a bust and nearing a boom soon in my opinion at least

2016 was bitcoins halvening it was also very oversold 
2020 is another halvening and bitcoin is over sold too

pretty much cost to mine doubles the price usually corrects sometime and then exceeds it and then dumps when the retail investors jump in and Fomo is at ATH .

Take your coins you have and move them to a wallet on your pc or somewhere you have the private keys to make sure you have access to any fork coins, or alternatively use an exchange that is supporting the s2x chain and will credit, bittrex and bitfinex comes to mind
