I can’t read Korean, but can give info on Japanese forums (mainly 2channel, now called 5channel)
The most “active” threads seem to be ones filled with day traders. Some people mention HODLing in those threads, but are usually ignored in the massive stream of day traders.
There are separate threads to “unite” the HODLers, but they tend to be less active.
Just looking at 2channel, it feels like the Japanese people get into Bitcoin to trade it, more than using it for transactions or hodling it. It’s possible that it just seems this way because there relatively isn’t much to talk about when it comes to using bitcoin or hodling it.

It’s about time you started Bitcoin. Start with GMO.

I would say the most popular is the [2channel cryptocurrency board](
From there, you can navigate to various threads. I didn’t link to the Bitcoin thread specifically because 2ch threads cap at 1000 responses. However, the largest Bitcoin threads have the title format “【BTC】ビットコイン情報交換スレッド◯◯◯(thread number)”

Just for some context, the crying/weeping voice is the live-streamer, and the mechanical voice is a software that reads the comments that are flowing across the screen. He was margin trading.
Translating what his screen says:
◼️Today’s profits: -28,286,256 yen (-252k USD)
◼️This year’s profits: About -30 million yen (-267k USD)
◼️ All-time net profits: About -10 million yen (-89k USD)

There actually was, and he was live-streaming his trades on Niconico (Japanese video and live-streaming site).
He lost 251k USD...

That should be something you determine by doing your own research, but yes, you should invest *in my opinion*.
The really important thing though is to only invest what you can afford to lose.

Make sure you choose a method with minimal fees.
For example, I use Coinbase (student, hard to get verified on other exchanges), and their fees are not really viable for buying small amounts. That’s why I try to buy as much as I can at once, every few weeks.

In Japan, a streamer on Niconico lost 28.28 million Yen (251k USD) because of stop loss on that drop today.
HODL, don’t day trade.

It seems to have thresholds. I just checked now, and buying 1-10 USD worth has a $0.99 fee, $11-$26 has a $1.49 fee, $27-$51 has a $1.99 fee and so on.
Edit: It may be because I’m using a card to buy. The app crashes whenever I try to buy via bank deposit.

What if I am a dependent (student) and cashed out &lt;$100?
