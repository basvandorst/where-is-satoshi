It's a very old European scam called The Spanish Prisoner.  Europe is the oldest whore on the block so we invented most of the scams out there.

Don't buy on margin - the moves are too violent  - you'll get stopped out 
Only buy "physical" BTC

Basically it's going up which it hasn't done for a while 
The good news is that BTC is above USD 5000 which is a big round number 
But in November there was big selling at about USD5600 and 6300 so it'll be interesting to see if BTC can break and hold above those levels

How much is the bet?

Interesting - maybe 
I have made a google calendar reminder to check if this happens

The Halvening says it is 23/5/2020

And 2020 is a leap year so a year is 366 away

NOTE OF INTERVIEW 
BTC 
Bought it as intellectual exercise – attracted by the beauty of the blockchain 
Liked its resilience after MtGox and increased position 
Views it as a Venture Capital investment – could lose it all or get a big pay off 
Disruptive to payment systems and settlement engines 
Susan Athey - Will never unseat the big 5 currencies but could unseat weaker currencies where governments confiscate assets or inflate away savings.  Argentinian friend’s family has lost their wealth four times through confiscation and inflation 
Fork is just growing pains 
Good way to fair price is to look at supply and demand curve – Pantera Capital has good stuff on this 
Could go down 50% but unlikely to drop further than that.  Warren Buffett said if you don’t mind an asset falling 50% then you can continue to hold it 
SEC reconsidering the Winklevoss ETF – that would push it as lot higher as difficult to buy BTC 
Total market cap is $38bn – could go to trillions 
Don’t invest more than you can lose - could go to zero.  
Holds it in a cold storage wallet 
Read Digital Gold 
BTC like Amazon – bought at $88 in late 1990s and watched it go to $7 – now $1000
Mentioned some problem with ripple protocol but I did not understand what he meant.  Someone got money they weren’t meant to get?? 
Ethereum/Ripple is growing in market share – keep an eye on it (apols I do not know the difference between Ethereum and Ripple or whether they are the same thing) 
AI 
He was quite dismissive 
Difficult because no clear goal in markets unlike Go or chess 
Could exploit behavioural anomalies 
Could slot in like passive or quant alongside active management
