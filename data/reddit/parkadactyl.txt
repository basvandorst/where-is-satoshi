No; but I've heard from trusted sources that it's quite exciting.

There were women. It was awesome.

What the... Besides that narcissistic diddy, the price on that site is now $6 per bitcoin! Amazing! I'm going to test a small amount and demand at the current $6 price and see whatsup
@_date: 2012-06-16 06:37:05
They might have changed the price in response to the spike today, I don't know, the new price is seen by other users as well. There would be no way to prove anything, and I'm probably just the victim of a spike.

Yeah I just didn't want to wait to set up a cheaper and safer way; lesson learned. I still have coins in my wallet I can use, lesson learned.

At 35%, as an American, that is about what I wound up paying.
@_date: 2012-06-16 18:47:14
So I emailed this guy about wanting to buy at the current $6, check my email an hour or two later saying that the price updates every 20 seconds and is now $6.60...

What better way to celebrate your patriotism than to engage in free market activities?
@_date: 2013-08-02 21:13:32
Yeah, unless you are trying to build Bitcoin infrastructure in the U.S.

You are saying that litecoin has benefits over bitcoin, but that doesn't matter because superlitecoin has benefits over litecoin, ad infinitum. That's not how it works. You have to look realistically at the user base and acceptance of currencies to determine their practical usage. Bitcoin is by far the largest, but that doesn't mean its flaws might, over time, force a switch to a different currency. Same with litecoin. It is an evolving process and to say that bitcoin or litecoin or superlitecoin will be the only majorly traded crypto in 5-10 years time is just ignorant.

You are all talk no walk. Give me at least as many reasons/examples as I give you and then we can have a serious discussion. You're just using insults and dismissive language.
@_date: 2013-03-24 18:27:45
I have outlined a few of the benefits over bitcoin. The largest of which, I think, is litecoin's mere existence, as an alternative to bitcoin. So yes, I can refute that. 
I am saying that it is good that people have the option to adopt litecoin, and good that there are more and more services/businesses accepting litecoin. The parable that litecoin is an 'early adopter scheme' can be applied to bitcoin as well. My personal faith in litecoin's future value appreciation lies within what I believe to be litecoin's strengths. Do the research and you will get a better idea. For example, novacoin was premined to hell and back before it's release. Now it is almost dead in the water. That is a prime example of an early adopter 'scheme', and just because early adopters of any successful crypto are rewarded doesn't make just any crypto a 'scheme'. By your definition, bitcoin is a scheme.

If you have any questions in particular I can ask Marco Santori in person next week
@_date: 2013-03-24 18:32:40
You act like I would be butthurt by that fact. You are the one who seems pretty butthurt by anything that refutes bitcoin's standing as the greatest thing since sliced bread. If it makes a difference, I did get into bitcoin at a fraction of the price it is now and have been into the crypto markets for a while. Perhaps you are butthurt over missing litecoin early adoption. But hey, still time to get in before it hits $1.

4-6 weeks.

Fair enough. Having multiple crypto's is a good thing for the whole market. It staves the fear of huge failures of one because the others serve as fail-safes. You can't dismiss the benefits of a coin because it can be easily replicated. There are many coins out there that are sha-256 based, but aren't going anywhere because they are not widely traded or accepted. The worth of coin lies within it's spending power, and the spending power of litecoin is increasing and ASIC-proof, making it a huge player in the market, even today. There are too many 'ra-ra bitcoin' types on this board who don't realize that litecoin, and all other coins, are actually beneficial to bitcoin.

This is the natural progression of any page as it gains popularity.

Brothers and sisters, the real enemy isn't each other. It's those who seek to attack cryptocurrencies as a whole. I have a dream that one day LTC and BTC proponents will be able to hold hands and bask in the glory of their decentralized network of friendship and respect, amen.
@_date: 2013-03-24 17:13:01
Faster transaction time and, for the next few years, being ASIC proof. These key advantages will make litecoin a major player as the crypto markets become more and more widely accepted.

Sadly, most machines will never be worth it. Even if they break even, it will only be because the USD equivalent of their mined coins is higher than the USD equivalent used to purchase the machine, and by that logic you are better off simply buying and holding Bitcoins in the first place.

Regulation is a catch-up game. We should be focused on innovating. Let the regulators catch up to us!

If you think Satoshi Nakamoto was one person then you are sadly misinformed my friend.

The larger blockchain doesn't matter to people who simply want to move the currency, they are most interested in timely transactions.

Litecoin gives people a safe and vetted alternative to bitcoin. There are new coins being introduced on a pretty regular basis. Look at novacoin. Premined to hell and back and is now a small and undesirable market. The merit of a coin is backed by the users who have faith in it and an increasingly large number have faith in litecoin.
