Please, another altcoin will take over because of a temporary problem? You don't understand why the majority of people get in the bitcoin game. 
Decentralized trust.
And like you mentioned yourself, within a few months/years bitcoin will have that decentralized trust combined with tps capabilities visa&amp;co can only dream of.
No team of people can ever gain the trust bitcoin has. 
Because then you have to trust people.

Open-source committee is the best form. Do your own research. I'll just add that the physical transport and mining of valuable metals requires a lot more energy. Also the ratio for a transaction per energy, will obviously drop when the amount of people using it grows.

Wrong. See in a world where most have become cold to their investments and switch on a whim. Having actual faith in something is considered weird and bad investing. Bitcoin is not a stock, company or only a currency. People who understand bitcoin 'get it' and are willing /seeing the importance of helping in any way they can. It's part of the Open-source nature of bitcoin. 
I'd like to add, that imo bitcoin is our only shot to a truly decentralized system. No alt I've seen comes even close to the properties bitcoin has. We've been incredibly lucky for bitcoin to emerge the way it did.
