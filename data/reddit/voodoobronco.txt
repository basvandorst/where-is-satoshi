The way my company works is buying CBD hemp biomass from farms that need cash now. Delivering biomass to labs to produce T free distillate. The pay outs are 120 days from drop off. T free per kilo is dropping every month. But as long as it stays above 2k. We double our money every 120 days. So our initial investment will do 8x this year. This will not last forever. And I will stack as many sats as possible till we get pushed out. Didn't mean to rustle jimmies with 401k talk.  Trying to rethink the 401k plan with bitcoin

Everyone who works for me is under 30. There is a gold rush for the next 3-5 years. The company isn't going to last that much longer. We know we have an amazing opportunity to make a lot of money the next couple years. I know what i'm investing in for long term. Just wondering if legally I could set up a 401k that just does bitcoin. Again if not, I still hope everyone who works with me would be down for the idea

Instead of stocks n bonds.  Only bitcoin and still get the tax benefits of 401k is what I mean. Get your keys at retirement

I don't have a 401k. I'm starting a hemp business that will be receiving millions of dollars every 120 days for the next 3-5 years. I want to take 10% of every crop and put it into bitcoin. I want all employees to have their own cold card and contribute 10% themselves. That's the basis of a 401k, just wondered if we could call it that and get tax breaks. If not I'll still do this for my employees

I'm just trying to make this work. If it can't be an official 401k what I would be down to do for my employees. Hopefully this sparks ideas with other people. Each employee holds their own cold card.  They show me each month they deposite 10%, I match with a 10% open dime stick. Didn't mean to trigger any feelings with the big bad banks. Just trying to set up a real retirement plan for my workers and friends.

You hold your own cold card, show company you deposite 10%. They match you with equal open dime stick.  You like that idea?

Thank you. My situation is im going into the hemp biz. There is a gold rush that is about to happen. It's not going to last forever. Seems like the plan is to buy everyone a cold card. Let them know my plan. Then give them on open dime stick every deal and hope they hodl

You only lose if you sell at a loss. It will eventually go over 20k. So even if you bought at 19k you just got to chill. But if it does drop to 2k... put more money in
