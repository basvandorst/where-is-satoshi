Bitcoin use has no effect on the stock price of Apple.

Did you think this comment through?

And what utopia are you living in?

Your ignorance is astounding, I'd bet most people here are in their 20s and have no financial background. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:47:50
Which means about 1/5 of them are spam bots
@_date: 2013-10-30 11:08:41
It has a lot of news because of people making large amounts of money off it - that's the only reason these virtual coins are worth anything. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:57:22
"wasn't risky enough"
@_date: 2013-12-08 02:38:38
Can you please tell me what claim he isn't backing up?
As I see it you make some wild claim that fiat currencies are suddenly going to become irrelevant without saying why.
He asks you why you choose Zimbabwe.
You then go off on him with a saying that he put words in your mouth and that anything else wouldn't work. Then you write this garbage - "Basically the only thing you can do to not look like a dunce is quote someone as seriously saying what you just said." So basically as long as someone else said it, it is suddenly valid?
@_date: 2013-12-07 03:04:48


How is that relevant?


Pretty hard to pay for things when you can't get access to an internet connection. 


Oh its plenty easy to resist bitcoin - maybe that it dropped over $200 overnight because China said no to it. 


     &gt;I'm going to need a source for that.

I don't keep all my money in cash though.

Bitcoin needs banks.
Unless you are getting your paycheck from your company in cash and then using localbitcoins to buy them. Sure when all your money is in bitcoins you don't need the banks but the same goes for PayPal. 
When you pay for something with Bitcoins the company is going to convert them using a bank to pay for their expenses. 
@_date: 2013-10-30 10:49:59
You've never done this I assume, any big chain is going to laugh and any small store is going to have no idea what you're talking about. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:46:06
Ah nice,
1 - invest in bitcoins
2 - tell people to invest
3 - profit
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:32:37
I'm not mad at all, I'm wondering what you think shows I'm mad?
Bitcoin investors think that the world is going to change overnight and start accepting bitcoin when you can't even use the coins without an internet connection. 


What status quo?
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:21:19


Where does it state that will happen?


So gold
@_date: 2013-12-08 22:27:02
hahaha - I'm not a bitcoin advocate but thanks for linking a 3 year old academic article about prosthetic limbs. 
"bonafide computer-generated alternate reality." - oh god
@_date: 2013-11-07 17:39:20
Because at that point it would be overvalued
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:28:05
Bitcoin is as much as a threat to banks as PayPal is. 
I'm also wondering how giving bitcoin a value of 1,245 is killing it off? Even at the max amount of bitcoins (21m) they would still be worth 700 each.

Boats also don't go anywhere without water

Bitcoin is now up $65 in a day, thats super-exponential
@_date: 2013-12-06 18:53:47
Ah yes the evil banks.
@_date: 2013-11-07 17:35:36
If people don't spend money the economy can't grow, just look at the recession, the government had to give people money through tax breaks so they would spend their money. 
A deflationary currency would never work, its why the biggest currencies in the world don't use it 
@_date: 2013-12-08 02:47:30
Your post is all kinds of terrible


Sure, &gt;It wasn't because of Silk Road.. but because I grew up in the 90s and saw the Internet go from obscure to mainstream to now integral part of our lives.
This is reddit in once sentence - a lie, a circlejerk, and a 90s reference. 


PayPal was disruptive, not a virtual coin.


The only people that want Bitcoin to keep going up, if people really wanted bitcoin to succed they would take the price drops and let the coin settle so they could actually use it. 


Yes take a line from a movie about growing a company to describe the market cap for a virtual coin.
Maybe someone could explain why can't take some actual criticism instead of downvoting. 
@_date: 2013-10-30 10:49:04
Apparently people just know the price of silver of the top of their head and its not enough to be compared to gold yet. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 03:31:26
You could of just said you didn't have a counter argument.
@_date: 2013-11-07 17:40:07
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:47:05
Considering the coins will be worth more tomorrow its a no brainer. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 21:58:38
So is this your response to everything?
@_date: 2013-12-16 19:03:44
Except the coins are capped at 21m, which will be hit in the near future.
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:47:27
Now wait 50 years before you can afford a flight. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:56:29
Wait I thought this was a currency not an investment?
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:16:53
What fiction book are you reading from?
@_date: 2013-10-30 10:53:05
Its an investment
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:58:17
and they deleted it, haha
@_date: 2013-11-07 20:32:07
Yes but at this point there's no balance - people are saving mass amounts of bitcoin and probably less than 1% of the coins are actually being spent on something. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 17:49:06
You can always hold out for the next big thing, I wouldn't say cashing out on a virtual coin is a stupid financial decision. He made an investment, recieved a 5% return, then cashed out. Seems like investing 101 to me.  
@_date: 2013-12-08 04:17:56
I didn't say reddit was a lie, I said your comment was a lie. 
This "dissecting" took me less than a minute. Just delete the coin, its worthless anyways. 
@_date: 2013-10-30 10:48:15
Why do you take offense to that? Clearly just saying something that helps you out?
@_date: 2013-10-30 10:58:24
People still get sick in a recession bro
